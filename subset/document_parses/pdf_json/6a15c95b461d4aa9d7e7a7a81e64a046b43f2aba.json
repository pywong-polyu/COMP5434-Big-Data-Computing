            "text": "Understanding how ecosystem services (ES) and ecosystem disservices (EDS) are affected by human-induced landscape changes is important to minimise trade-offs and maximise synergies between Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets, and for equitable development across governance scales. However, limited research investigates how ES and EDS can change under past, current, and future land uses. This study, conducted in the Luanhe River Basin (LRB), demonstrates the interaction between humans and the environment under past, current, and future land uses at the river basin scale in China, using a stakeholders' participatory capacity matrix to characterise both ES and EDS. Results indicate that forests and water bodies provided the highest overall ES capacity, while the lowest scores were reached in built-up and unused land areas. Built-up land and cropland provided the highest overall EDS, while the lowest EDS scores were for water bodies. By applying the ecosystem services potential index (ESPI) and ecosystem disservices potential index (EDSPI), we found that the ESPI of all the ES declined from 1980 to 2018 and would continue to decline until 2030 without sustainable and conservation development strategies in the LRB. The EDSPI under all future scenarios in 2030 was projected to increase compared to the baseline in 1980. This study recommends establishing and implementing sustainable environmental protection policies and cross-regional and trans-provincial eco-compensation schemes for minimising trade-offs in ES. The study proposes an integrated research framework that could be useful for understanding the effect of historical and future human-environment interactions on ES and EDS, and SDGs achievement.",

The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2005) provided four major categories of ES: provisioning services (PS), regulating services (RS), cultural services (CS) and supporting services (ecological integrity: EI). However, ecosystems can also produce and deliver various goods and services that are economically or socially harmful, compromise health, or are even life-threatening. These are referred to as ecosystem disservices (EDS) and are increasingly accounted for when evaluating ecosystems Lyytim\u00e4ki and Sipil\u00e4 2009; von D\u00f6hren and Haase 2015) . EDS has been defined as 'the ecosystem generated functions, processes and attributed that result in perceived or actual negative impacts on human well-being' (Shackleton et al. 2016) , which mirrors the definition of ES. Studying EDS is important to limit trade-offs between SDGs. However, compared with ES, EDS draws much less research attention: the total literature on EDS was only 0.7% of that on ES between 1976 and 2018 (Blanco et al. 2019) . EDS is even absent from most recent ES conceptual advances (Costanza et al. 2017; Haines-Young and Potschin 2018) . Very limited research takes EDS into account at a river basin scale (Khan et al. 2019; Sun et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "The quantification and implementation approaches of ES and EDS vary in complexity, research scale, resource requirements and accuracy. Examples include the capacity matrix approach (Burkhard et al. 2009 based on participatory expert opinion via quantitative proxies assigned per land use type based on literature or experts; simple biophysical models (e.g. InVEST toolset, Sharp et al. (2020) ); integrated models of the dynamic complexity of humanenvironment interactions (e.g. ARIES, Villa et al. (2009) ); and resource-demanding complex process-based models (e.g. Soil and Water Assessment Tool model, Gassman et al. (2007) ). Among these approaches, the expert-based capacity matrix approach of ecosystem services assessment, which considers stakeholders' opinions, has become one of the most popular ES assessment techniques today (Jacobs et al. 2015) . It is useful in providing statistical and spatial information and illustrations in environmental planning and management for guiding policymakers' strategic planning , particularly in the context of the SDGs. The capacity matrix is a look-up table that links ecosystem types (ETs) to ES potentially provided by these ETs and allows the assessment of a higher number of ES than other assessment methods. Based on experts' knowledge, the matrix gives a quick assessment of ES and EDS potentially provided in an area (Stoll et al. 2015; Vihervaara et al. 2012) . Although this matrix has subjective limitations depending on the expert's knowledge level and uncertainties (see Hou et al. 2013 , Jacobs et al. 2015 , and Campagne et al. 2017 , it is a useful tool for decision-makers and environmental managers (Swetnam et al. 2011) . Compared with other methods, the capacity matrix can be applied at different scales (e.g. Stoll et al. 2015; Jiang et al. 2021) . It can overcome the issues of reduced quantitative data and spatial heterogeneity by asking experts to estimate scores. The capacity matrix has been widely developed and applied in case studies around the world to evaluate the ecosystem services potential or capacity (Burkhard et al. 2014 Garc\u00eda-Llamas et al. 2019; Hermann et al. 2014; Huq et al. 2019; Jiang et al. 2021; M\u00fcller et al. 2020; Stoll et al. 2015) . Furthermore, ES can be jointly assessed with EDS in the matrix, although the concept of EDS has only recently been added by Campagne et al. (2017) and . The optimal expert panel size, expert confidence score, and scoring variability statistics have been proposed to address some of the criticisms on using capacity matrices (e.g. uncertainty due to the differences between experts' knowledge) (Campagne et al. 2017) .",

Foreign Ministry 2016). However, with the rapid economic growth, urbanisation and industrialisation, and the growing resource consumption during the past three decades, ecological and environmental problems have increasingly become bottlenecks restricting China's sustainable development agenda (Liu and Diamond 2005; Shapiro 2016) . A river basin is a semi-closed ecological and economic system that plays an important role in global and regional development . In China, river basin ecosystem degradation has decreased ES and threatens the river basin's ecological security. Currently, there are a series of land use conflicts between ecosystem conservation, economic development, water demand and agricultural intensification (Dan et al. 2014; Fu et al. 2007; Liu and Diamond 2008; Ma 2011) . Meanwhile, the ES capacity is affected by land use changes driven by current and future development scenarios. This relationship between ES and land use changes highlights the importance of ES and EDS in guiding land use planning and ecosystem management strategies to promote sustainability (Dong et al. 2018; Sun et al. 2019) . Therefore, assessing ES and EDS under current and future development scenarios for China's large river basins, especially considering stakeholders' opinions, will help understand the human-environment interactions for achieving the SDGs in China and comparable large river basin contexts.",

The CNLUCC data for the study area were derived from Landsat TM or ETM, with a corresponding spatial resolution of 30 m \u00d7 30 m. There are six major land use and land cover categories, including cropland, forestland, grassland, water, built-up land, and unused land, which were subdivided into 25 subcategories in the CNLUCC dataset. The minimum classification accuracy of selected polygons was 94% (Xu et al. 2018b ). According to the available ecosystem types of the locality and local expert knowledge, six major ETs: cropland, forest, grassland, water body, built-up land and unused land, which could be subdivided into 14 subcategories of ETs were identified for this research.

(2017) and The future dynamics of ETs in the LRB under different scenarios in 2030 (Table 1) was derived from the projected land systems based on the CLUMondo model (Van Asselen and Verburg 2013) by Xu et al. (2021) . The land system presents the information of three main classification factors: (1) land use and cover, (2) livestock, and (3) agricultural intensity. Land use and cover represent the landscape's composition, while livestock and agricultural intensity data represent important characteristics of land management and farming systems. Each variable's classification threshold was arbitrarily determined by the natural breaks in the variable distribution (van Asselen and Verburg 2012). Four scenarios for the LRB in 2030: Trend, Expansion, Sustainability, and Conservation were designed based on shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), environmental protection targets, local plans and policies, and the information from the stakeholders' workshop in Tianjin. The SSPs are scenarios of projected socioeconomic global changes used to derive greenhouse gas emissions scenarios with different climate policies (O'Neill et al. 2014; Riahi et al. 2017) . The Trend scenario follows the middle-of-the-road shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP2), a pathway that does not shift markedly from historical patterns. The Expansion scenario follows the fossil-fuelled development shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP5), where people exploit abundant fossil fuel resources, the global economy grows at the highest speed, and the global urbanisation rate reaches 92% in 2100. The Sustainability scenario follows the sustainable shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP1), a sustainable pathway that is people-oriented and where land use is strongly regulated (Van Vuuren et al. 2017) . The socioeconomic context of the Sustainability scenario was used as a baseline for the conservation scenario and extended by the implementation of the ecological restoration and protection policy targets. The land system simulations have been conducted in three steps: (1) calculating the relationship between the land systems and local explanatory factors for the initial year (2000); (2) parameterising and calibrating the model based on the 2015 land systems map; (3) modelling the future land system maps using the most optimised parameters.",

The ESPI is an index to estimate a region's potential to deliver ecosystem services based on an ecosystem service capacity matrix (Burkhard et al. 2014; Grima and Singh 2020) . For applying the ESPI in this study, the 14 subcategories of ETs were merged into their corresponding major category of ETs (i.e. Cropland, Forest, Grassland, Water body, Built-up land, and Unused land) to allow for the use of the ESPI. According to Grima and Singh (2020) , the ESPI value estimated can be weighted by the area occupied by each terrestrial ecosystem (including inland waters). For each major category of ETs and ES class defined in the matrix, the mean of weighted values gives output values between 0 and 5. Here, we took the Ecosystem Services Potential of Provisioning Services (ESPPS) to demonstrate how the ESPI was calculated. There are six ETs and 11 PS indicators (i.e. Crops, Livestock, Fodder, Capture fisheries, Aquaculture, Wild foods, Timber, Wood fuel, Energy (biomass), Biochemicals and medicine, and Freshwater), and each intersection can have a maximum value of 5, so the maximum Ecosystem Services Potential of Provisioning Services (ESP PS ) possible is 330. The maximum ESP PS (330) divided by the actual ESP (sum of all area occupied-weighted estimated values between 0 and 5) is the ESPI PS of the LRB (dimensionless [0-1]). This method is also applied to calculate the Ecosystem Services Potential of Regulating Services (ESP RS ), Ecosystem Services Potential of Cultural Services (ESP CS ) and Ecosystem Services Potential of Ecological Integrity (ESP EI ).",

The EDSPI under all future scenarios for 2030 is projected to increase compared to the baseline in 1980. Among these increases, the overall EDSPI of all the EDS is projected to be the largest in the Trend scenario because the built-up land delivers the highest EDS score, followed by the Cropland and Woodland, and also, Table 2 Capacity matrix with mean ES and EDS capacity scores. Mean confidence scores for ET and ES/EDS are on the table margins (grey colour cells). The values/colours of mean ES and EDS capacity scores indicate the following capacities: 0-1 = very low relevant capacity (red); 1-2 = low relevant capacity (orange); 2-3 = medium capacity (yellow); 3-4 = high capacity (light green); 4-5 = very high relevant capacity (dark green). The textures of each cell are based on multiplying each ET and ES score confidence scores with the follow-ing confidence levels: 'Low confidence' (diagonal) refers to a confidence score less than 3, 'Moderate Confidence' (no texture) refers to a confidence score between 3 and 6, 'High confidence'(horizontal) refers to a confidence score greater than 6. ES = Ecosystem Service; in the Trend scenario, the LRB will experience the most extensive urban expansion. EDS increases even under the Conservation scenario are due to the combination of the moderate expansion of urban areas (EDS of Floods and Heat island effect), cropland (EDS of Pests and diseases), and afforestation (EDS of Fires).

These uncertainties may be sourced from the variability of specific knowledge between experts (Hou et al. 2013 ) and the variability of experts' confidence in their scores (Jacobs et al. 2015) . However, only a few studies consider the variability and confidence in the analysis with the final scores, although it has been suggested that this analysis of scores should be the norm (Campagne et al. 2020 ). Statistical measures such as mean, standard deviation (SD) and confidence score are robust if more than 15 experts are involved in the capacity matrix research (Campagne et al. 2017) . We used the SD of the capacity score for each ES and EDS and each ET among the experts to estimate the score variability among the 25 experts (Tables  S2 and S3 ) as this is one useful approach to identify variabilities in scoring agreement between experts (Campagne et al. 2017) . Furthermore, the confidence scores were analysed to estimate expert confidence in providing each ES and EDS's capacity score and each ET Campagne et al. 2017 ). The mean SD on all scores provided by 25 experts is only 1.30, and all the SDs in Tables S2 and S3 are less than 2, which means that although the 25 experts were from various institutions and had different disciplinary backgrounds, they all had relatively similar views on the capacities of ES and EDS of different ETs in the LRB. These low levels of SD suggest that the experts who participated in our study are familiar with the overall ecological environment of the LRB, and using the average mean score of the capacity matrix from these experts for determining the ES and EDS of LRB was robust.",

The experts' unfamiliarity with some EDS was logical as this concept is relatively new, and it was the first time to be applied in the LRB in a research context. Similarly, the contribution of unused lands in ES is often overlooked, and only a few studies focus on this as the unused lands are generally considered to play a negligible role in providing ES (Costanza et al. 1997 (Costanza et al. , 2014 Tolessa et al. 2017) . This was also evidenced by our capacity matrix scores, which shows that the average mean score of the ES and EDS delivered by 'Bare land, rock or gravel' with lowlevel confidence was only 0.8.

The 'two belts' are windbreak and sand-fixing forest belt of the Bashang Plateau and coastal wetland and shelterbelt. The 'multi-point' refers to various ecological protection areas scattered in the plains and mountains.

The simulation results suggested that the ESPI of all the ES declined from 1980 to 2018 and would continue to decline until 2030 without sustainable and conservation development strategies. The loss of area of forests would be the main driver of such ESPI loss. Under the Trend, Expansion and Sustainability scenarios, the ESPI loss in the LRB would occur due to some areas of forests being replaced by built-up lands, grasslands and croplands. The conversion from forest to built-up lands accounts for the greatest ESPI loss under the Trend scenario, while the conversion from forests to the croplands would be the main reason for ESPI loss under the Expansion and Sustainability scenarios. The results from the modelling under the Conservation scenario showed that implementing the ecological restoration and protection policy targets would increase the area of forests, leading to the ESPI increase in the LRB.",

Previous studies in other study areas and the identification of Forest Ecological Zones in the LRB in this study, all have demonstrated that forest plays a vital mitigation role in climate change (Popkin 2019), removing air pollution (Eisenman et al. 2019; Nowak et al. 2006) , helping in soil and water conservation (Biao et al. 2010; Zhu et al. 2018 ) and increasing biodiversity (Sayer et al. 2019 ). Therefore, these afforestation policies would help achieve SDGs 3 (Good Health and Well-being), 13 (Climate Action), and 15 (Life on land). However, since the 'Returning Farmland to Forest Program' is one of the widely implemented measures of afforestation in China (Gao et al. 2020) , these afforestation policies likely will, in return, have negative implications for SDGs 1 (No Poverty) and 2 (Zero Hunger). Furthermore, according to the simulation results under future scenarios, with the urban expansion and food demand increases, the built-up land areas and the cropland areas will have a greater demand for other ES, and therefore, increase the pressure on the natural ecosystem.",

For example, increasing the number of nature reserves integrated into urban and around the urban area perimeter should be considered in urban development planning. It is also important to set up top-down afforestation and forests restoration policies that encourage local people to protect the biodiversity of forest systems , such as the ecocompensation schemes described in the next sub-section.",

The LRB is an important water source for Tianjin, and the water body in the LRB plays an important role in all ES, particularly in terms of freshwater provision (Goal 6: Clean Water and Sanitation). The quantity and quality of water resources in the LRB have profound influences on Tianjin's socioeconomic development. Over the years, Hebei province has actively taken protective measures, such as the ban on cage fishing in Panjiakou and Daheiting reservoirs and shutting down coal mining and steel enterprises (Wei et al. 2021) and suffering the loss of development opportunities to ensure water safety in Tianjin by investing much labour, material, and financial resources in ecological projects. In 2017, the 'Upstream and Downstream Eco-compensation Agreement for Water Diversion Project from Luanhe River to Tianjin City' was signed between Tianjin and Hebei (Xinhua News 2019). However, until June 2019, as the downstream beneficiary (outside of the LRB basin), Tianjin has only paid the amount of 300 million RMB to Hebei for the improvement of water quality, which is a very small compensation compared to the benefits Hebei has brought to Tianjin (Xinhua News 2019; Yang et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "The biggest challenge in the policymaking of a transprovincial compensation mechanism was the divergence of interests between provinces. First, the two sides had greater differences in the premise of compensation. Tianjin insisted that the Panjiakou and Daheiting Reservoirs should be classified as a water source protection zone. However, once the water source protected zone was delineated, cage fishing in the reservoir area had to be banned and farming and human activities in the reservoir area limited. Due to the difficulty of resettlement of a large number of aquaculture households, Hebei was opposed to this plan. Second, there was no initial agreement on the purpose and content of establishing an ecological compensation mechanism. Tianjin was willing to give financial compensation to the water source protection project implemented in Hebei. However, Hebei wanted to obtain more comprehensive compensation because this was not only about the cost for water source protection and water pollution control but also about addressing poverty due to the development opportunities lost for protecting water sources. Third, at present, the recognition of existing eco-compensation methods in Tianjin and Hebei seems to be limited to the recognition of existing ecological compensation methods-the downstream government fiscal funds only compensate the upstream areas. The behaviours from enterprises, society and the private sector have not been included in the compensation scope, so the actual compensation scale may be underestimated. It also should be noted that although the LRB is an important water source for Tianjin, Tianjin has already created a multi-source water supply system after the opening of the middle water supply route of China's Southto-North Water Transfer Project in December 2014 . It is possible that, in the future, Tianjin may stop compensating Hebei if it sources another more competitive provider for their drinking water needs (e.g. more water from the South-to-North Water Transfer Project). This potential scenario means that Hebei province may take the 'risk' in making all the changes based on an eco-compensation agreement. The environmental condition and socioeconomic activities that previously occurred in the LRB, as mentioned above, are unlikely to return. Therefore, there is a need for an effective information-sharing mechanism among multiple stakeholders and regional governments to establish the longterm guaranteed trans-provincial eco-compensation standard by combining gross ecosystem product and full cost accounting under the guidance of the national government (Fang et al. 2021) .",

This inevitably impacts the livelihoods of farmers and herdsmen, and as a result, affects the economic development of upstream regions (Goal 2: Zero Hunger and Goal 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth). A sustainable tradeoff needs to be preserved to maintain other PS such as food which remains important given the rapid urban extension in the region (Goal 11: Sustainable Cities and Communities). For this, a sustainable ecological compensation mechanism between upstream and downstream regions for increasing financial transfer payments to upstream ecological protection areas should be refined and effectively implemented.

In this study, we considered the land management at the river basin scale to a certain extent. The future dynamics of ETs in the LRB under different scenarios in 2030 (Table 1) was derived from the simulated land systems based on the CLUMondo model by Xu et al. (2021) . These future land systems have considered not only the land use and cover but also the livestock and agricultural intensity data which represent important characteristics of land management and farming systems at the river basin scale. Nevertheless, in this study, land use alone lacks local or pilot-scale information regarding important components of ecosystem conditions that support ES capacities, such as soil type and quality, water availability, geomorphology, which will be affected by land management and vary in space and time. The spatiotemporal invariance of the capacity matrix results in the distant areas with the same ET to have the same scores without accounting for their specificity (Campagne et al. 2020; Jacobs et al. 2015) . The local or regional land management practices, such as the policies implemented in different ecological functional zones in the LRB, would change the ecosystem conditions or even the socioeconomic condition (e.g. human population density or economy).",

In this study, using the EDSPI, we consider each ET provides the value of EDS equally at the river basin scale from 1980 to 2030. However, the provision and value of EDS might also vary in time and space (Dobbs et al. 2014; Linden et al. 2019) . Some local scale EDS (e.g. dangerous plants/animals) may not be problematic if there is no direct contact between people and these disservices at the river basin scale. Such limitations also result in little difference between the ESPI and EDSPI values under different scenarios. The normalised indexes, ESPI and EDSPI, have successfully indicated the long-term trend of ES and EDS changes from 1980 to 2030 at the river basin scale. Nevertheless, the ES and EDS dynamic due to the area change of ETs or land management activities at a local scale is not captured by the river basin scale indexes like ESPI and EDSPI. In future studies, additional spatial analysis can be factored in, or spatial invariance (e.g. regional variation) can be considered in the ETs lists in the matrix. For example, the experts could also be asked to provide ranges of ES and EDS values depending on different ecosystem states, locations (e.g. upstream, midstream and downstream of the river basin), or under different land management practices (e.g. poor, average, good). In addition, more studies to understand the localised weighted coefficients might be useful to realise an accurate assessment of the ES and EDS for the study area.",

            "text": "The results show that the LRB is a diverse landscape with hotspots for ES and EDS, defined as six ecological functional zones. However, the ecosystems in the LRB are threatened in the future because of changes in land use without sustainable and conservation development strategies, mainly reflected in the decreases of ES and increases of EDS. The ES and EDS are a useful bridge to understand the effect of land use on the SDGs and associated targets and indicators. This study demonstrated that the impacts of ES and EDS changes would not be homogeneous in the landscape. These changes will positively and negatively affect different SDG targets in different locations of the LRB. For maximising synergies and reducing trade-offs between SDGs and associated targets on the sub-national scale, policy recommendations such as establishing and implementing sustainable environmental protection policies and cross-regional and trans-provincial eco-compensation schemes are suggested. The integrated research framework simulating the ES and EDS under past, current and future development scenarios, especially taking into account stakeholders' opinions and various levels of policy, could be used for identifying hotspots and coldspots of ES and EDS at the river basin scale, providing valuable stakeholders' perspectives for environmental management, and help establish and implement the policy for minimising the trade-offs and maximising the synergies between SDGs and targets.",
