Based on our proposed model, we further use the optimal control approach (with the objective of minimizing total deaths) to find the optimal dynamical distribution of face masks between the healthcare workers and the general public. It is not surprising that all the face masks should be solely reserved for the healthcare workers if the supply is short. However, when the supply is indeed sufficient, our numerical study indicates that the general public should share a large portion of face masks at the beginning of an epidemic wave to dramatically reduce the death toll. This interesting result partially contradicts with the guideline advised by the US Surgeon General and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in March 2020. The optimality of this sounding CDC guideline highly depends on the supply level of face masks that changes frequently, and hence it should be adjusted according to the supply of face masks.",

            "text": "In several recent papers [12, 25, 31] , some dedicated compartmental models are developed for assessing the community-wide impact of massively using face masks by the general public, which shows its high efficacy in curtailing community transmission and reducing the burden of the pandemic. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no related discussion about how to optimize the allocation of face masks between healthcare workers (HCW) and the general public. In April 2020, the CDC started to recommend wearing cloth face coverings for the general public (GP). Due to initial shortage in supply, the CDC advised to save face masks for healthcare workers [9] . It poses a natural question to ask: whether one should distribute a portion or none of face masks to the general public along the epidemic outbreak? In other words, should the general public continue reserves all the face masks for the HCW only? We are particularly interested in the group of HCW since higher nurse-to-patient staffing ratios can result in healthier patients and hence protecting the health of the limited number of HCW is paramount [4, 23] . In general, it may takes several years to train a HCW who are qualified to do the professional job. The objective of this work is to design an epidemic model with face masks and stay-at-home factors to find the optimal dynamical distribution of face masks among the healthcare workers and the general public, with the purpose of minimizing the total number of deaths. This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, an optimal control model based on a new two-group SIR model is introduced, where the effects of wearing face masks and stay-at-home policy are considered. The justification and estimation of the relevant parameters of our proposed model is discussed in Section 3. Section 4 presents the numerical results, where three different scenarios are demonstrated. Finally, some conclusion and discussion are given in Section 5.",

The subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the GP and the HCW, respectively. We do not include the asymptomatic (or latent) compartment because we assume that all infected individuals are infectious even though they do not develop any symptoms [11] . Let K 1 (t) \u2265 0 and K 2 (t) \u2265 0 be the numbers of face masks distributed in the two groups over the given time period [0, T ]. The average number of available face masks for these two groups are \u03c1 1 = K 1 /(S 1 +I 1 +I 2 ) and \u03c1 2 = K 2 /(S 2 +R 2 ). Here, we assume that the recovered GP (R 1 ) do not need face masks but the recovered HCW (R 2 ) will return their job and still need to wear face masks. Moreover, the infected HCW (I 2 ) are released from their duty of healthcare and thus considered as a part of GP. Now, we can set the transmission rates for the GP and the HCW to be \u03b2f 1 (\u03c1 1 ) and \u03b2f 2 (\u03c1 2 ), where \u03b2 > 0 is the intrinsic transmission rate of SARS-CoV-2, and f 1 and f 2 are positive and decreasing functions.

As a comparison, Figure 5 shows the corresponding outcomes if strictly following the CDC guideline to allocate all face masks to HCW, where the total death numbers of the GP and the HCW become J 1 = 182, 409 (with 26% increase) and J 2 = 29, 890 (with 10% increase), respectively. The significant increasing (about 23%) in the total death toll is somewhat surprising but reasonable, since more infected numbers in GP due to not wearing face masks would infect more HCW and hence lead to higher death rates and more deaths in both groups. For the scenario (iii) with very sufficient supply, our optimal control results are reported in Figure 6 . Different from both the scenarios (i) and (ii), it shows the majority of face masks should be distributed to the GP at the beginning of the epidemic outbreak, and then gradually shifted to the HCW along the outbreak. The total death numbers of the GP and the HCW are J 1 = 80, 897 and J 2 = 12, 208, respectively. For comparison, Figure 7 shows the corresponding outcomes if following the CDC guideline to allocate all face masks to HCW, where the total death numbers of the GP and the HCW become J 1 = 155, 540 (with 92% increase) and J 2 = 21, 871 (with 80% increase), respectively. Astonishingly, the total death numbers are almost doubled if strictly following the reasonably sounding CDC guideline, where the protection effect of wearing too many face masks for HCW is essentially saturated based on our model setting. It is also worthwhile to notice that the optimal allocation of masks has greatly flatted the infectious peak curves and hence lead to much less deaths.",

However, when there are plenty supply of face masks, the general public should share a large portion of face masks at the beginning of an epidemic outbreak. This result somewhat contradicts the recommendations given in March 2020 by the US Surgeon General [6] and the CDC [5] . The optimality of this reasonable sound CDC guideline highly depends on the supply level of face masks that changes frequently and varies by locations, and hence this guideline should be modified according to the supply of face masks. Based on our choices and estimations of parameter values and assuming that the supply of face masks is sufficient and the stay-at-home policy remains effective, our model indicates that the first epidemic wave would have ended in May 2020 with a cumulative total 93,105 deaths, with 80,897 deaths from the GP and 13,208 deaths from the HCW.

With a random initial guess, the lsqnonlin solver converges to the (local) optimally estimated parameters: q = 0.03, I(0) = 1070.
