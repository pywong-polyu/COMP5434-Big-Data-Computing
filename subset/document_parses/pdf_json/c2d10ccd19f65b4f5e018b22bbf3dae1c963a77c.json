Docking studies suggest a putative heparin/heparan sulfate-binding site adjacent to the domain that binds to ACE2. In vitro, binding of ACE2 and heparin to spike protein ectodomains occurs independently and a ternary complex can be generated using heparin as a template. Contrary to studies with purified components, spike protein binding to heparan sulfate and ACE2 on cells occurs codependently. Unfractionated heparin, non-anticoagulant heparin, treatment with heparin lyases, and purified lung heparan sulfate potently block spike protein binding and infection by spike protein-pseudotyped virus and SARS-CoV-2 virus. These findings support a model for SARS-CoV-2 infection in which viral attachment and infection involves formation of a complex between heparan sulfate and ACE2. Manipulation of heparan sulfate or inhibition of viral adhesion by exogenous heparin may represent new therapeutic opportunities.",

As of July 10 th , 2020, the virus has spread to 213 countries, causing more than 12.3 million confirmed infections and at least 555,000 deaths (World Health Organization). Current isolation/social distancing strategies seek to flatten the infection curve to avoid overwhelming hospitals and to give the medical establishment and pharmaceutical companies time to develop and test antiviral drugs and vaccines. Currently, only one antiviral agent, Remdesivir, has been approved for adult COVID-19 patients (Beigel et al., 2020) and vaccines may be 12-18 months away. Understanding the mechanism for SARS-CoV-2 infection and its tissue tropism could reveal other targets to interfere with viral infection and spread.",

Given its location, viruses and other infectious organisms, must pass through the glycocalyx to engage receptors thought to mediate viral entry into host cells. Many viral pathogens utilize glycans as attachment factors to facilitate the initial interaction with host cells, including influenza virus, Herpes simplex virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and different coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1 and MERS) (Cagno et al., 2019; Koehler et al., 2020; Stencel-Baerenwald et al., 2014) . Several viruses interact with sialic acids, which are located on the ends of glycans found in glycolipids and glycoproteins . Other viruses interact with heparan sulfate (HS) (Milewska et al., 2014) , a highly negatively charged linear polysaccharide that is attached to a small set of membrane or extracellular matrix proteoglycans (Lindahl et al., 2015) . In general, glycan-binding domains on membrane proteins of the virion envelope mediate initial attachment of virions to glycan receptors. Attachment in this way can lead to the engagement of protein receptors on the host plasma membrane that facilitate membrane fusion or engulfment and internalization of the virion.",

The basic disaccharide subunit consists of 1-4 linked D-glucuronic acid (GlcA) and 1-4 linked N-acetyl-D-glucosamine (GlcNAc), which undergo various modifications by sulfation and epimerization while the copolymer assembles on a limited number of membrane and extracellular matrix proteins (only 17 heparan sulfate proteoglycans are known) (Lindahl et al., 2015) . The variable length of the modified domains and their pattern of sulfation create unique motifs to which HS-binding proteins interact (Xu and Esko, 2014) . Different tissues and cell types vary in the structure of HS, and HS structure can vary between individuals and with age (de Agostini et al., 2008; Feyzi et al., 1998; Han et al., 2020; Ledin et al., 2004; Vongchan et al., 2005; Warda et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2011) . These differences in HS composition may contribute to the tissue tropism of viruses and other pathogens.",

Binding of SARS-CoV-2 S protein to cells requires engagement of both cellular HS and angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), suggesting that HS acts as a coreceptor. Therapeutic unfractionated heparin (UFH), non-anticoagulant heparin and HS derived from human lung and other tissues blocks binding. UFH and heparin lyases also block infection of cells by S protein pseudotyped virus and native SARS-CoV-2. These findings identify cellular HS as a necessary co-factor for SARS-CoV-2 infection and emphasizes the potential for targeting S protein-HS interactions to attenuate virus infection.",

Adjacent to the ACE2 binding site and exposed in the open RBD conformation lies a group of positively-charged amino acid residues that represents a potential site that could interact with heparin or heparan sulfate ( Fig. 1A and Suppl. Fig. S1 ). We calculated an electrostatic potential map of the RBD (from PDB ID 6M17 (Yan et al., 2020) ), which revealed an extended electropositive surface with dimensions and turns/loops consistent with a heparinbinding site (Fig. 1B) (Xu and Esko, 2014) . Docking studies using a tetrasaccharide (dp4) fragment derived from heparin demonstrated preferred interactions with this electropositive surface, which based on its dimensions could accommodate a chain of up to 20 monosaccharides ( Fig. 1B and 1C ). Evaluation of heparin-protein contacts and energy contributions using the Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) software suggested strong interactions with the positively charged amino acids R346, R355, K444, R466 and possibly R509 (Figs. 1A, 1D, and 1E) . Other amino acids, notably F347, S349, N354, G447, Y449, and Y451, could coordinate the oligosaccharide through hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. Notably, the putative binding surface for oligosaccharides is adjacent to, but separate from the ACE2 binding site, suggesting that a single RBD could simultaneously bind both cell-surface HS oligosaccharides and its ACE2 protein receptor. Consistent with the hypothesis that only one RBD in the trimeric S protein is exposed in an active conformation, the putative HS binding is partially obstructed in the closed RBD conformation, while exposed in the active state (Suppl. Fig. S1 ).",

S ectodomain protein also bound in a saturable manner to heparin-BSA conjugates immobilized on a plate (Fig. 2C ). In contrast, ACE2 did not bind to heparin-Sepharose. ACE2 also had no effect on binding of S protein to heparin-BSA at all concentrations that were tested (Fig. 2C , inset). The ectodomain protein bound immobilized recombinant ACE2 (Fig. 2D ). Inclusion of UFH or hexadecasaccharides (dp16) from heparin did not affect the affinity of S protein for ACE2 and only mildly decreased the extent of binding in this assay format (Fig. 2D ). Biotinylated ACE2 bound to immobilized S protein (Fig. 2E) . A ternary complex of heparin, ACE2 and S protein could be demonstrated by binding of S protein to immobilized heparin-BSA and titrating biotinylated ACE2. Binding of ACE2 under these conditions increased in proportion to the amount of S protein bound to the heparin-BSA (Fig.   2F ). These findings support a model in which the binding sites for HS and ACE2 in the RBD act independently and can engage their receptors simultaneously.",

Although it is related in structure to HS, heparin is much more highly sulfated and negatively charged and can act as a strong unspecific cation exchanger. To determine if the SARS-CoV-2 S protein binds to typical HS found on cells, S ectodomain protein was added to human H1299 cells, an adenocarcinoma cell line derived from Type 2 alveolar cells (Fig. 3A) . Spike ectodomains bound to H1299 cells, yielding an apparent K D value of ~75 nM. Treatment of the cells with a mixture of heparin lyases (HSase), which degrades cell surface HS, dramatically reduced binding (Fig 3A) . The S ectodomain also bound to human A549 cells, another Type 2 alveolar adenocarcinoma line, as well as human hepatoma Hep3B cells (Fig. 3B ). Removal of HS by enzymatic treatment dramatically reduced binding in both of these cell lines as well (Fig. 3B ). Recombinant RBD protein also bound to all three cell lines and binding largely depended on HS (Fig. 3C) . A melanoma cell line, A375, was tested independently and also showed HS dependent binding ( Fig 3D) . The extent of binding to HS across the four cell lines varied ~4-fold. This variation was not due to differences in HS expression as illustrated by staining of cell surface HS with mAb 10E4, which recognizes a common epitope in HS (Fig. 3E ). In fact, A375 cells have the highest expression of cell surface HS, but the lowest extent of S protein binding (Fig. 3D) , whereas Hep3B cells have low amounts of cell surface HS and the highest binding of S protein. This lack of correlation could reflect differences in the structure of HS or available ACE2.",

Thus, to extend these studies, pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) was engineered to express the full-length SARS-CoV-2 S protein and GFP or luciferase. Vero E6 cells are commonly used in the study of SARS-CoV-2 infection, due to their high susceptibility to infection. Spike protein binding to Vero cells also depends on cellular HS, and binding was sensitive to HSases, heparin and split-glycol heparin ). Under either condition, infection was reduced 2 to 3-fold by HSase. Heparin very potently reduced infection more than ~4-fold at 0.5 \u00b5g/mL and higher concentrations (Fig. 7G ). In contrast, studies of SARS-CoV-1 S protein pseudotype virus showed that HSase-treatment actually increased SARS-CoV-1 infection by more than 2-fold, suggesting that HS might interfere with binding of SARS-CoV-1 to ACE2 ( Fig 7H) . Infection of H1299 and A549 cells by SARS-CoV-2 S pseudotype virus was too low to obtain accurate measurements, but infection of Hep3B cells could be readily measured (Fig. 7I ). HSase and mutations in EXT1 and NDST1 dramatically reduced infection 6-to 7-fold. Inactivation of the 6-O-sulfotransferases had at best a mild effect unlike its diminutive effect on S protein binding (Fig. 4) , possibly due to the high valency conferred by multiple copies of S protein on the pseudovirus envelope.",

Competition studies, enzymatic removal of HS, and genetic studies confirm that the S protein, whether presented as a recombinant protein (Figs. 2-6), in a pseudovirus (Fig. 7) , or in intact SARS-CoV-2 virions (Fig. 8 ), binds to cell surface HS in a cooperative manner with ACE2 receptors.

Other coronaviruses also utilize HS, for example NL63 (HCoV-NL63) binds HS via the viral S protein in addition to ACE2 (Lang et al., 2011; Milewska et al., 2018; Milewska et al., 2014; Naskalska et al., 2019) . In these examples, initial tethering of virions to the host cell plasma membrane appears to be mediated by HS, but infection requires transfer to a proteinaceous receptor. The data presented here shows that SARS-CoV-2 requires HS in addition to ACE2. Binding to heparin and ACE2 occurs independently in biochemical assays with purified components, but on the surface of cells the interaction apparently occurs in a co-dependent manner. We imagine a model in which cell surface HS acts as a \"collector\" to allow for optimal presentation to ACE2, making viral infection more efficient. HS varies in structure across cell types and tissues, as well as with gender and age (de Agostini et al., 2008; Feyzi et al., 1998; Ledin et al., 2004; Vongchan et al., 2005; Warda et al., 2006; Wei et al., 2011) . Thus, it is possible HS contributes to the tissue tropism and the susceptibility of different patient populations in addition to levels of expression of ACE2 .",

Unlike lectins that have a common fold that helps define the glycan binding site, HSBPs do not exhibit a conserved motif that allows accurate predictions of binding sites based on primary sequence. Instead, the capacity to bind heparin appears to have emerged through convergent evolution by juxtaposition of several positively charged amino acid residues arranged to accommodate the negatively charged sulfate and carboxyl groups present in the polysaccharide, and hydrophobic and H-bonding interactions stabilize the association. The RBD domains from the SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 S proteins are highly similar in structure (Fig.   1G ), but the electropositive surface in SARS-CoV-1 S RBD is not as pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 S RBD ( Figure 1H) . A priori we predicted that the evolution of the HS binding site in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein might have occurred by the addition of arginine and lysine residues to its ancestor, SARS-CoV-1. Instead, we observed that 4 of the six predicted positively charged residues that make up the heparin-binding site are present in SARS-CoV-1 as well as most of the other amino acid residues predicted to interact with heparin ( Fig. 1) . SARS-CoV-1 has been shown to interact with cellular HS in addition to its entry receptors ACE2 and transmembrane protease, serine 2 (TMPRSS2) (Lang et al., 2011) . Our analysis suggests that the putative heparin-binding site in SARS-CoV-2 S may mediate an enhanced interaction with heparin compared to SARS-CoV-1, and that this change evolved through as few as two amino acid substitutions, Thr444Lys and Glu354Asn.",

There is precedent for targeting proteinglycan interactions as therapeutic agents. For example, Tamiflu targets influenza neuraminidase, thus reducing viral transmission, and sialylated human milk oligosaccharides can block sialic acid-dependent rotavirus attachment and subsequent infection in infants (Hester et al., 2013; von Itzstein, 2007) .

Thus, heparin may have dual action: as a hemostatic agent to prevent clotting and as an antiviral to decrease viral attachment. The anticoagulant activity of heparin, which is typically absent in HS, is not critical for its antiviral activity based on the observation that MST derived heparin and split-glycol heparin is nearly as potent as therapeutic heparin (Figs. 5 and 7) . Additional studies are needed to address the potential overlap in the dose response profiles for heparin as an anticoagulant and antiviral agent. Antibodies directed to heparan sulfate or the binding site in the RBD might also prove useful for attenuating infection.",
