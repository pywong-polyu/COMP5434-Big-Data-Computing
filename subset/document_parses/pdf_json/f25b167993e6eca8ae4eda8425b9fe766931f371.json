These shared connections between commentaries are important as even ubiquitous concerns regarding \"training\" can include similar but different meanings or priorities. For example, on the one hand, opportunities for training in spatial methods are often limited or centralized, especially in African and SE Asian contexts (see commentaries by Gayawan and by Saita, Tun and Parker) . On the other hand, training deficiencies for demographers also can have implications more generally around their participation in big ideas/big challenge research topics and for how the field as a whole engages in critical studies of people in places and time. Indeed, while substantive demographic topics weave through all commentaries it is worth highlighting the commentaries by Balk, Leyk, and Montgomery, and, by Curtis. The former express their dismay at the lack of engagement by demographers-relative to other social scientists-in the urban systems research, especially in middle and low-income countries and the latter calls for a critical evaluation of our dominant frames, and the need for a more critical reorientation of the field of spatial demography.",

At the individual level, the timing and location of demographic outcomes are linked to transitions in the individual life course (Willekens, 2014) . For instance, the loss of a job or completion of education or training in one place may trigger migration to another place or, conversely, a migration may result in family separation or unemployment in the destination location. While related, spatial demography can be distinguished from both population geography and demography (Raymer et al. 2019) . Population geography focuses on locational aspects of places and their influence on populations. Demography focuses on the mechanisms of population change but traditionally treats each population independently from other populations distributed in space.",

However, despite these trends, people are not working for considerably more years and are worried about who will support their pensions as they age. Young adults, and especially women, are struggling to balance building successful careers and raising children. Governments and individuals are concerned about the pressures of large numbers of migrants on social cohesion and urban infrastructure, including traffic and housing costs. On the other hand, regional towns are worried about their future prospects of finding labor and keeping their populations from disappearing. And, employers are having to seek labor from around the world for both low-skilled and highly specialized jobs.",

When disaggregated by age and sex, often the population counts and demographic events become small, which increases the effects of both random behavior and the chances of disclosure (identification). Many statistical offices are not allowed to release detailed spatial data for reasons of data confidentiality, which limits analyses. Furthermore, as shown in my recent paper published in Spatial Demography (Raymer et al. 2020) , data on age-specific rates of fertility, mortality and migration (interregional and international) for subnational populations may not be available or measured appropriately for demographic accounting; they come from different sources (censuses, vital registers, administrative sources). Indirect estimation methods, such as combining data from multiple data sources, may be used to overcome some of these problems. They may also be used to estimate detailed components of demographic change for small areas or subpopulations (for example, by citizenship status or skill level).",

Ideally, this would involve integrating recent developments in spatial dependency modelling into the multiregional demography framework (see, e.g., Rogers, 1995 Rogers, , 2020 . While fixedrate multiregional models have been useful for understanding the mechanisms of interacting subpopulations and the implications of particular rates within a system, they are often considered unrealistic or impractical for planning. Thus, we also require flexible models that account for uncertainty. This is a challenging issue but an important one, especially when estimating the demographic components of population change for small population areas (Bryant & Zhang, 2019; Swanson & Tayman, 2012, p. 235) . Accounting for the large number of correlations present in the data can make spatial demographic models complex and difficult to estimate. The correlations include those across ages, cohorts, over time and space. Moreover, with migration, there are often correlations in the counter flows-that is, migration from i to j is related to migration from j to i.",

            "text": "Since the specialist meeting in 2011 several developments in spatial econometrics and geographically weighted regression (GWR) have occurred. However, challenges remain for spatial demographers. In this commentary, I first discuss the advances in both global and local spatial statistical methods and then elaborate on areas I hope will improve in the decade ahead. A global spatial analysis perspective aims to tackle spatial dependency embedded in ecological data by including a spatial lag or spatial error term in a model. Spatial econometrics models are, arguably, the most popular methods (LeSage & Pace, 2009) but their heavy focus on a continuous dependent variable is a major shortcoming. While the Bayesian modeling approaches and software programs (e.g., WinBUGS) allow discrete dependent variables (Lunn, 2000) , the analysis is often time-consuming and not compatible with other statistical software. Nonetheless, the development of integrated nested Laplace approximations (INLA) (Rue et al. 2009) in the past decade not only improves computational efficiency of Bayesian modeling but also facilitates the applications of spatial econometrics (i.e., spatial autoregressive model) to non-Gaussian dependent variables (e.g., Poisson and Negative Binomial distributions). The R-INLA package (Martins, 2013; Rue, 2017) is well integrated with other spatial modeling libraries in R (R Core Team, 2014) and promotes generalized spatial econometrics modeling with an emphasis on random and spatially structured errors across space (Krainski, 2018) . As many health or population outcomes do not follow a Gaussian distribution, such as infant deaths or confirmed coronavirus disease (COVID) counts, empowering spatial demographers to specify a model that fits the distribution of the dependent variable should minimize the potential bias in parameter estimation and statistical inference.",

Using simulations, LeSage and Pace (2014) argue that this common belief is a myth, for two reasons. First, researchers are reluctant to attribute the changes in spatial regression results to their model misspecification and the choice of W becomes an easy target. The second reasons is the misinterpretation of spatial econometrics models with a spatial lag term (e.g., spatial lag or spatial Durbin models). Most research using these models has interpreted the coefficient estimates as if they are partial derivatives reflecting the net impacts of other independent variables on the dependent variable. However, this interpretation is incorrect (LeSage & Pace, 2009) and only recently has this issue been discussed in empirical papers (Mussa et al. 2017; Yang et al. 2015) . LeSage and Pace's work does not provide a definitive conclusion but it serves as an important step in helping spatial demographers to carefully think about the meaning of W.",

GWR has served this aim, despite criticisms about multiple testing and multicollinearity among local estimates (Griffith, 2008; Wheeler & P\u00e1ez, 2010) . Some advances in GWR are notable. First, semiparametric GWR allows both global and local independent variables to co-exist in a model (Nakaya, 2015) . And, Multiscale GWR (MGWR) removes the restriction that all independent variables must share the same bandwidth (Fotheringham et al. 2017) , which offers the flexibility to examine if the impact of one independent variable on the dependent variable is more localized than that of another independent variable. Second, quantile regression has been integrated into the GWR framework (Chen et al. 2012) , which is known as the geographically weighted quantile regression (GWQR), and the bootstrap approach to statistical inference minimizes the concerns about multiple testing and statistical inferences (Chen et al. 2020) . GWQR is particularly relevant to demographic and health research because the mean value of a distribution may not be of researchers' interest. For example, with GWQR, obesity researchers can answer the question of how an independent variable is associated with body mass index (BMI) ranging between 25 and 30 (i.e., overweight), rather than the mean value, across the study region.",

First, and foremost, methodological advancements seem to outpace theoretical developments, specifically the lack of theory from an ecological perspective (Howell, Porter, & Matthews, 2016) . Most theories related to demographic and health outcomes are based on individual perspectives and directly applying these theories to an ecological analysis is problematic (i.e., the ecological fallacy). It becomes critical for spatial demographers (and more broadly social scientists) to develop spatial theories based on the ecological data. Some actions may help overcome this challenge, such as encouraging the publications of descriptive findings and engaging in a discourse on how collective individual behaviors/relationships could be reasonably translated to ecological associations. Second, compared to a decade ago, longitudinal ecological data have become more readily available. However, relatively little effort has been made to improve the analysis of spatial panel (or spatiotemporal) ecological data (cf. Millo & Piras, 2012) . While many sociodemographic variables may not change rapidly from one year to another, bringing the temporal dimension into spatial analysis should offer a better understanding of spatiotemporal dynamics, which goes beyond the descriptive trends across space and time, respectively.",

Should this gap be filled, spatial demographers will have an extensive toolbox for global spatial analysis. Last, but not the least, spatial demographers should consider how to meaningfully define W, instead of using the conventional geographical adjacency or distance. For example, in light of the ongoing COVID pandemic, the flows of essential workers among areas (e.g., from their residential to working areas) should provide more information about how the disease transmits across space than the conventional first-order Queen or nearest-K neighbors. More is needed from spatial demographers to justify or even theorize on the use of W. Spatial demography has benefitted from developments in spatial statistical methods in the past decade. Should the four areas or gaps discussed above be filled in the next ten years, spatial demographers will create a stronger connection between theory and method and be in a better position to advocate the importance of space and time in the field.",

            "text": "Interests in the field of spatial demography has grown rapidly, largely due to the availability of spatial and spatiotemporal data, advances in methodology, and in computational tools. Researchers in a wide range of fields increasingly work with georeferenced data and there are now a growing number of applications examining spatial processes in fertility, mortality, migration, health, and their determinants in developed and developing countries. Regional disparities in developmental programs across developed and developing nations have also been of concern to analysts interested in spatial modeling. This is because when developmental measures are placed on maps, they reveal opportunities for identifying location-specific intervention programs, making them appealing. In Africa, the use of spatial methods in demographic and health studies has started to take root. Most of the statistical methods underlying spatial models are extensions of the familiar statistical techniques including regression and time series models. Except in some cases where the models are allowing for the classical inferential methods, the estimation procedures are often based on Bayesian techniques; due to advances in speed and algorithm development particularly the further development of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). The MCMC method allows for flexibility in fitting hierarchical models, thus, giving room for different approaches of conceptualizing spatial patterns and processes. Further, most of these techniques are implemented in code-oriented software such as R. Some demographers and social science researchers with little background on statistical and computational methods tend to shy away from these methods (rather than confront their fears). However, there are an extensive catalog of useful texts with practical examples that allow interested researchers to link statistical theories to data problems especially those pertaining to spatial modeling. Most texts come with R-code that can easily be modified or serve as building blocks for modeling real life spatial data, thus aiding our understanding of phenomena of interest. Books I have found to be extremely useful in this regard include Blangiardo and Cameletti (2015) , Fahrmeir et al. (2013) and Moraga (2020) .",

Several chapters discuss model formulation using geoadditive predictors, which embrace regression models such as generalized additive models (GAM), generalized additive mixed models (GAMM) and stepwise regression model.

These methods extend the classical regression model by offering a comprehensive approach that enables the simultaneous modeling of predictor variables of different types including nonlinear effects of metrical covariates, spatial correlation, and heterogeneity, and the linear fixed effects of categorical variables while the response variable of interest can take on one of several distributions especially those commonly encountered in demography and health studies, thus, encompassing different kinds of regression models. The initial method development has seen applications in estimating the levels of different demographic and health phenomenon of interests. However, recent extensions allow the estimations of more interesting spatial attributes of the data such as the variances, standard deviations or other parameters of interest as seen in some recent applications (Gayawan, Fasusi, and Bandyopadhyay, 2020; Somo-Aina & Gayawan, 2019) . Though, as with other methods, the estimation procedures are based on fully Bayesian approaches. There are textbooks aimed at readers with average statistics backgrounds to understand these concepts and their applications (see Fahrmeir et al., 2013; Fahrmeir & Kneib, 2011 and the reference list). These authors have made available data and code to illustrate their methods and this should enhance knowledge dissemination among demographers seeking to apply regression-based models to spatial data. Though there are R packages such as R2BayesX and BayesX that enable easy implementations of STAR models in R, the software BayesX -Bayesian Inference in Structured Additive Regression Models (Belitz et al., 2015) freely available at www. bayesx. org, not only implements the methods but also provides easy-tounderstand examples in its tutorial manual.",

A useful feature of this method is that it lessens computation burden especially when the estimation involves models with high spatial and temporal resolution. Unlike the Bayesian inference through MCMC that sometimes leads to several days of computing time, the INLA approach, implementable through the R package R-INLA (www.r-inla. org) provides accurate and fast results. The method is exceptionally suitable for both areal and point reference data. The later applications arise when observations are measured at finite set of specific points in a given region and the interest is to generate a continuous spatial field and also to predict values at unobserved locations or in identifying areas where the risks of exceeding potentially harmful threshold is higher.",

The TFR decline has been heterogeneous across the region (World Population Prospects, 2019). Singapore experienced the decrease in TFR quicker than other nations, followed by Thailand and Malaysia while Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) and Cambodia experienced a lag in the fertility transition. Extreme subnational heterogeneity (especially between rural and urban areas) also exists in fertility.",

For example, young skilled workers have been considered to be an essential component of regional plans for a rapid economic catch-up process over the last three decades. However, with an aging population it becomes increasingly necessary to depend on labor from high fertility areas; including nations that have not yet fully transitioned or subnational areas with continued high fertility (i.e. rural areas). Migration is therefore a major spatial demographic attribute of the Southeast Asia region (Rigg, 2013) , with migrants from nations with lower economic opportunities moving toward wealthier nations, and those from poorer rural areas moving into urban areas.",

In 1905 a population census was undertaken, during the reign of King Rama V and under the administration of the Ministry of the Interior, though it covered only 12 precincts out of a total of 17 administrative precincts. Some colonial authorities carried out population censuses, though quality was frequently of questionable nature (French Indo-China, 1945; Hirschman & Bonaparte, n.d.) . After independence, most nations established their own offices of statistics with one goal being to undertake and maintain population censuses. The United Nations has been instrumental in aiding the collection, analysis, and dissemination of census data. However, regional and civil conflict, lack of resources, and difficulties in reaching some populations have meant that gaps remain in the data. In some cases, demographic health surveys (DHSs) (U.S. Agency for International Development n.d.) or other targeted surveys have been helpful in filling some data gaps (Corsi et al., 2012; Mutunga et al., 2020) . DHSs have been conducted in Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Myanmar, Philippines, Thailand, Timor-Leste, and Vietnam. DHS programs tend to be limited in their spatial and temporal coverage, but often offer data that are collected at high spatial resolution that is useful for micro-level spatial demographic analyses.",

Urban places are not only clusters of high population density: They exhibit similar densities in physical and human capital, educational and health facilities, and the levels and units of government. If access to beneficial resources could be measured by geographic distance alone, then urban residents would enjoy a decided advantage. But especially in large cities, neighborhoods range from the comfortably advantaged to the distressingly disadvantaged; the residents of disadvantaged neighborhoods can be socially and economically excluded from resources that may be no more than a stone's throw away. Urban spaces are also crisscrossed by a great variety of social, economic, and transport networks that connect people inhabiting different neighborhoods, workplaces, and residences. The possibilities for social linkage thus depend on resources situated across an array of physical sites. Viewed in this way, cities and towns of various sizes and forms offer multiple opportunities for the fine-grained, multi-level analyses at which demographers excel. And yet, apart from the Chicago School demographers who have mainly studied the cities of high-income countries, very little of the field's attention has been directed to urban communities elsewhere in the world. This is, frankly, inexplicable. The vast majority of the world's upcoming population growth is projected to take place in the cities and towns of low-and middle-income countries. Spatially-detailed empirical measures of the urban-rural continuum and connectivity have been flooding into the literature over the past decade, enriching the possibilities for understanding and modeling behavior across the full range of rural and urban landscapes. In poor countries, large within-urban and urban-rural differentials have already been documented in demographic behavior and outcomes, including age at marriage, fertility, use of contraception and unmet need, rates of abortion, children's education, and both infant and child health and mortality (Montgomery et al., 2003) .

The prominence of migrants and the residentially mobile in the urban scene-people whose ideas and resources are drawn from life-experiences in multiple places-adds to the analytic challenge. Perhaps as many as half of those forcibly displaced by civil strife or environmental disruption eventually make their way to slums and poor urban communities (Forced Migration Review, 2020) , and from them there is doubtless much to be learned about shocks, adaptation, fragility, resilience, and mental health. From a demographer's point of view, it is hard to survey this panorama of issues and imagine a more inviting scientific prospect. Yet to date, demographers seem to have declined the invitation.",

While some positive changes have occurred-notably in the improvement of sampling frames in major survey programs to capture slum-dwellers, and the continued commitment to providing geospatial data on both survey respondents (albeit with intentional dislocation that compromises analytical use in urban areas) and small census units-the major changes of the past decade have taken place outside demography proper. Geographers, remote-sensing experts, geophysicists, and ecologists have made great progress in improving models and data on the spatial extents of the human built-up environment and its interactions with non-human environmental processes (Leyk et al., 2020; McDonald et al., 2011; Pesaresi et al., 2016; Small, 2020; Small et al., 2018; Montgomery et al. in press) . Epidemiologists have drawn on mobile-phone and social media data to trace out social networks and approximate short-term migration flows (Tatem, 2014) . It is now far easier than it was a decade ago to describe within-urban environments using resources such as OpenStreetMap (e.g., Barrington-Leigh & Millard-Ball, 2020; Boeing, 2020) . These new data enable the shifting boundaries of urban spaces to be delineated in far greater detail than was previously possible, and shed much-needed light on the interior organization of these spaces.",

Taking a broad view on training, my efforts range from formal semester-long courses and several-day workshops, to on-going working groups and one-off seminars, to directing or contributing to graduate master's and doctoral committees, to publishing in field journals. In each of these pursuits, I see a need for more theoretical development in spatial thinking, and I see push back and barriers to such development.

While not all demographers are sociologists, demographers are equally habituated in problematizing Black populations (and other populations of color) and the places they reside, even when the research is intended to address racial inequality. An example of this is the pathologizing narrative that dominates the literature addressing neighborhood effects on health. It is within Du Bois's approach to community and urban studies that a potential pathway for spatial demographers exists. Here, guiding principles include studying local areas rather than national aggregates in order to capture heterogeneity in social environments and embedding populations within (historical) networks that make a place, its opportunities and its constraints (Itzigsohn & Brown, 2020) .",

Massey's work reveals how particular ways of thinking about space and place are tied up with particular social constructions of gender relations, which can be extended to race relations, class relations, and other relations derived from social relations (Massey, 1994) . Drawing from Massey, we can understand spatial relations and spatial processes as social relations taking a particular geographical form (see Neely & Samura, 2011) . Massey argues for the consideration of the local, specific, concrete, and descriptive, which is opposite of the universal, abstract, and generalizing science. She asserts the former approach is coded feminine while the latter is masculine, and this symbolic association gives rise to the devaluation of the former. This devaluation is among my list of our field's failings.",

I, myself, was trained under the Chicago School doctrine, yet I come from a place that cannot be adequately represented through this lens. This doctrine promotes an ahistorical, universalist perspective that excludes differences, agency, and delegitimizes alternative standpoints (Itzigsohn & Brown, 2020) . What we need is a framework shift that incorporates the socio-historical forces that make and give meanings to place, reflects on appropriate spatial units and scales, is explicitly spatial in its theory and methods, and builds from a spatial heterogeneity orientation.

They did not touch upon Phillips's call for \"a critical look at how geographers and others have conceptualized, measured and interpreted patterns of segregation.\" (Phillips, 2007 (Phillips, , p. 1139 . In another review focusing on spatializing segregation measures (Wong, 2016) , I questioned the validity of existing conceptual foundations of segregation measurement, which has been dominated by the threedecade-old segregation dimensions proposed by Massey and Denton (1988) . While we have been trying to develop more effective measures to differentiate the spatial arrangements of different population groups, the meanings of segregation need to be interrogated further. What does the term \"segregation\" really mean despite being used in various contexts? Among all the dimensions, clustering seems to be closest to people's perception of segregation. A concept related to clustering is spatial autocorrelation (SA) and segregation studies have employed SA measures (e.g., Brown & Chung, 2006) . Do all these measures, spatial and aspatial, based on multiple concepts really reflect segregation or something else? Segregation is often regarded as undesirable because when people are separated spatially, they are assumed to be unequal (Goldsmith, 2003) . But what if separated but equal? Would it be more effective to focus directly on the unequal outcomes rather than on segregation-a surrogate? We occasionally raised these substantive questions, but we have not made much progress in sorting them out.",

Another type of individual-level data are mobility data, including geo-referenced social media and mobile phone data (e.g., Blumenstock & Fratamico, 2013; Silm & Ahas, 2014) . As these data often include time stamps, the temporal dimension can be ingested into measuring segregation (van Ham & Tammaru, 2016) . These individual-level spatiotemporal trajectory data also play a role in stimulating research to address the stubborn geographical scale issue in measuring segregation, part of the MAUP. Measuring segregation also has taken the multi-level modeling approach (Fowler, 2016; Harris, 2017; Manley et al. 2015) , although some general ideas may be dated back to decades ago (Moellering & Tobler, 1972; Wong, 2003a Wong, , 2003b . A closely related approach is the variable scale approach, which may be exemplified by the bespoke method supported by relatively fine-scale population data available in certain countries or through estimations \u00d6sth et al., 2014 . To a large degree, these are sensitivity analyses depicting the changes in segregation level when size of neighborhood changes (Wong, 2005) .

Considering the estimate reliability is a major challenge in spatial analysis when using data from ACS and other population and health surveys, such as the US Census's Current Population Survey (CPS), the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention's Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) data and the US National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. During the past decade, researchers have made some headway in incorporating estimate error in geovisualizing estimates statistically , determining class breaks in choropleth maps using simple statistical concepts (Sun et al., 2015 (Sun et al., , 2017 or sophisticated optimization methods (Koo et al., 2017; Mu & Tong, 2019; Wei & Grubesic, 2017) , and measuring spatial autocorrelation (Jung et al., 2019; Koo et al., 2019) . Therefore, we currently have some tools to analyze population survey data spatially with more honesty by considering error associated with estimates (Koo et al. 2018) .",

Before 2010, applying the more sophisticated and spatial segregation measures was challenging as some measures required spatial operations not supported by generic tools (Wong, 2003a (Wong, , 2003b . After 2010, a series of effort relying on open-sourced tools has improved the situation. Apparicio upgraded his C#-based Segregation Analyzer to the R-based Geo-Segregation Analyzer (Apparicio et al., ) . Other R-based tools included the \"seg\" package developed by Hong et al. (2014) , and more recently the ambitious attempt by Tivadar (2019) with OasisR. On the Python track, a segregation module was implemented in PySAL (Cortes et al., 2020) . Now, we have no shortage of computational tools for measuring segregation. However, reliability of these tools should be tested thoroughly as in the case of testing spatial statistical tools (Bivand & Wong, 2018) .",
