Even though, by the end of June 2021, more than 181 million cases had been registered and more than 3.9 million people had died around in the world [1] . This health emergence gave rise to highly articulated systems of data collection in order to keep track of the advance of the disease in every country. One of the most used and cited of these systems was created and is maintained by Johns Hopkins University [1, 2] .",

The last update for the Air Quality Database from the World Health Organization (WHO) lists PM data for 4300 cities in 108 countries, comprising data from 9690 air quality monitoring stations [8] . Most stations are located in USA, Europe, Japan and China and the total number of stations and cities monitored in the world is, in fact higher comprising more than 15 000 air quality monitoring stations in over 6000 cities [9] . At least partly, the differences between the numbers in these two reports may reflect data accessibility. Access to historical air pollution data varies widely and many cities around the world do not make data readily available. For those cities which have historical air pollution data and make them available, the way they are provided, and their accessibility is highly variable. Table 1 compares air quality data availability for 23 selected cities, in different regions of the world and different levels of air pollution. Islamabad has no city-specific website and the national one Detailed air quality data should be freely available to improve transparency and data availability. Cities/ countries should work on providing either an English webpage or a website which can be translated by common web browsers. A global service with historical data from all the available stations on the world would be the ideal solution.",

Buenos Aires has no PM 2.5 historical data, while they are discontinuous for Johannesburg. Data output format can also be a problem.

The information is apparently there, but translation engines are not able to translate them. In this case, websites that mirror some air pollution data in China and can be automatically translated, such as China's air quality online monitoring and analysis platform-AQI [10] may be a way to get some data. Japan is the country with the largest coverage of air quality stations per area [9] . However, Tokyo air quality website makes it virtually impossible to access the data without knowing Japanese. There is an English webpage but with only limited functions. For Seoul, the English webpage has no data search function. The Korean website, when accessed by browser translation, is difficult to navigate and find the data, especially for individual air monitoring stations. For Moscow, interestingly, current year data can be visualized in graphs for each air quality monitoring stations and air pollutant but cannot be downloaded. Data download is possible in another website which has an English webpage. However, search is troublesome, and data are downloaded partially in English and partially in Russian.",

Seoul, Tokyo, and Beijing, some of the cities with major problems in air pollution data accessibility due to language issues, would benefit from the experience from cities like London and New Delhi. Islamabad, one of the most polluted capitals in the world, should give priority to improving data transparency. Besides Islamabad, many other highly polluted cities in Southeast Asia or the Middle East do not have any record of official air quality monitoring. These include Peshawar, another Pakistan city, Ulaanbaatar, Kabul, Manama, and Kathmandu. For all of them, except Kabul, US Embassies and Consulates are a helpful alternative data source since they have their own air quality monitoring [11] . Other agencies like US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and European Environmental Agency (EEA) provide data access for several US and European cities, respectively [12, 13] .

Changes in air pollution, caused by COVID-19 pandemics, brought air quality to attention of the public and governments, which should be used to speed up the adaptation of agencies like US EPA and EEA to allow more detailed air quality data search. Besides this, it should also induce cities/countries to improve transparency and provide English webpages with full data access. Finally, a global service which would be updated in real-time with historical data from air quality monitoring stations from all over the world, like the Johns Hopkins University website for COVID-19, would be a really useful tool, which would greatly increase transparency and accessibility to air quality data.",
