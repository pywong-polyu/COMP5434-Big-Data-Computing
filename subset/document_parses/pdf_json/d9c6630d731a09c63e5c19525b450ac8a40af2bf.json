However, the qualitative nature of these guidelines makes it difficult to quantify the exposure risk in varied settings. Researchers have developed tools that predict the risk of transmission from exposure through inhalation of emitted SARS-CoV-2-containing aerosols. Risk assessment tools provide an important means of gaining understanding of dynamics of transmission and evaluating and comparing risks associated with local environmental conditions, community epidemiological factors, and mitigation options. Typically, the infectious disease risk assessment tools utilize either a deterministic dose-response approach or, alternatively, a Wells-Riley approach [15]. A detailed comparison of dose-response models and Wells-Riley models applied to infectious disease risk assessment is provided in Sze and Chao, 2010, addressing both models' advantages and limitations. Specific to SARS-CoV-2, Miller et al. (2021) [16] offers a Wells-Riley-based method to model transmission and has developed a companion COVID-19 Aerosol Transmission Estimator spreadsheet-based tool [17]. The Wells-Riley-based method addresses physical factors that contribute to indoor transmission, applying a uniform well-mixed box (WMB) assumption and transmission estimates using the Wells-Riley equation. Bazant and Bush, 2021 [18] provide a comprehensive physical model of the factors that affect indoor transmission and released a spreadsheet-based tool and online app [19] that calculates safety guidelines to limit the viral transmission based upon Wells-Riley and WMB assumptions. This tool recommends the total number of hours of exposure that are permissible given the number of people, their behavior, characteristics of the room and its ventilation, and the prevalence of COVID-19 and variants in the community. Parhizkar, et al., 2021 [20] developed a doseresponse approach and model that uses a WMB assumption and a novel treatment of the inhaled and deposited doses. They demonstrate the model's capability against well-documented COVID-19 outbreaks and offer a demo version of an online tool [21]. Wagner, et al., 2021 [22] offer a comprehensive modeling study that examines both indoor and outdoor exposures from two-person interactions, examining near-field and far-field effects, and modeling the behavior of particulates of various sizes. Other modeling efforts have focused on predicting transmission risks using epidemiological and behavioral factors and population statistics [23] [24] [25] , without addressing facility-and event-specific physical mechanisms that would affect transmission risk.",

Public health officials have had to reevaluate how the public should interact to reduce and contain viral spread [2] [3] [4] [5] , leading to assessment of worker and group risks associated with viral exposure in various settings [6] [7] [8] [9] . Risk assessment and planning regularly consider the contribution of an array of factors, using largely qualitative guidance from public health and media sources [3, 9, 10] , such as the viral exposure pathways, risk of infection (e.g., number of cases per population), efficacy of interventions and personal protective equipment (PPEe.g., masks, gloves), human behavior (e.g., adhering to public health guidelines, hand washing, social distancing), and environmental factors (e.g., ventilation).

The CEAT model is embedded in an Adobe\u00ae PDF (Portable Document Format) file and was coded in JavaScript using Adobe Acrobat's \u00ae \"Prepare a Form\" function. The model's user interface is shown in Fig. 2A and is available for download at https://www.covirt.org/exposure-assessment-tool/ as a PDF. The PDF platform was chosen instead of a web app, since the PDF allows organizations to use the tool within the privacy and security of their own networks and devices, eliminating any concern that an organization's private worker safety information was being shared externally. Additionally, the PDF offers the ability to save and disseminate the results for specific events and scenarios as individual PDF files. The underlying algorithm used in CEAT leverages aspects of both Wells-Riley models and doseresponse models. An important difference between the CEAT model and the other models discussed above is that CEAT assesses the additional higher concentration of virus containing aerosols that may occur when people are in close proximity and applies this approach to groups between 2 and 250 people, both indoors and outdoors. The model relies on information that the users would have available or could reasonably estimate, addresses the mechanisms that are within the organization's control (e.g., distancing, duration, ventilation rates, filtration, mask wearing, vaccination requirements, and option for indoor/outdoor activities), and communicates a clear and easily interpretable result. The model attempts to address the full range of exposure risks within a community, from highest-exposure risk to people known to be infected, typical of a clinical environment, to lowest-risk exposure to people who rigorously follow public health guidance.",

Dose is the amount of material that passes through the boundary based upon the intake rate, concentration, and exposure time. In this case, the boundary is the entrance to the respiratory system (i.e., through the nose, mouth, and other mucosa) [29] and the intake rate is the inhalation rate. Importantly, rather than a mass of material, we are only concerned with the quantity of material that contributes to transmission of disease. For viral dose-response models, the disease-causing quantity is often expressed in plaque forming units (PFU). A Wells-Riley based model expresses dose as an amount of quanta and when applied in a Poisson probability distribution, the complement of the Poisson distribution's probability mass function (with the assumption number of occurrences is zero) can be used to predict an infection rate [15, 30, 31] . Engaging in activities with high inhalation and exhalation rates, such as group exercise, strenuous work tasks, or singing [32] , is thought to correlate with higher doses and transmission risks [33] . Dose is the appropriate endpoint for a risk model, since it captures the contributions of concentration, exposure time, and inhalation rate. Since the model is meant to evaluate risks for events that include groups of people, and the number of people in each group is a variable that can be adjusted when planning events, we use a total group dose ( ) as the basis for our model:",

By benchmarking the dose calculations to a baseline scenario that is considered high risk by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), the model's results can be aligned with the OSHA classifications of exposure risks [34] (see Table   S1 ). The OSHA risk classifications depend on the industry type, the need for close contact (i.e., within 6 feet or approximately 2 meters) with people known to be or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2, or requirement for repeated or extended contact with persons known to be or suspected of being infected with SARS-CoV-2 [34] . We define the baseline scenario to represent a person (perhaps a healthcare worker) who is exposed to a COVID-19 infected person for 15 minutes in an indoor setting with typical ventilation. We apply a range of assumptions to this scenario, addressing each of the factors in Table S2 to arrive at a baseline scenario. This scenario was estimated to be consistent with between 4 and 9 percent likelihood of infection, based upon the range of infection rates reported in various studies due to close contacts, presumably involving wild type SARS-CoV-2 transmission based upon the dates of the cases included in the studies in early 2020 [35, 36] . The inhalation dose values for other scenarios are compared to the baseline value through the simple ratio.",

We apply the calculated eddy diffusivity in a novel way that still allows us the advantage of using the computationally simple near-and far-field approach. Outdoors, only the near-field concentration contributions are used since the far-field is considered to be negligible [41] . Furthermore, also presented in detail in the STARS Methods, the CEAT concentration algorithm uses an approach for extending the near-and far-field approach to groups of people at set distancing intervals through the application of the superposition principle [42] .

To demonstrate how NASA ARC safety office has utilized this tool, we provide their assessment of exposure potential in 73 different scenarios throughout the campus ( Fig. 4 and Data S1). Since NASA ARC has been using this tool throughout the pandemic, every assessment used the latest COVID-19 case numbers from the State of California [46] .

Brooks-Pollock et al. [54] provided a stochastic transmission model based on social contact data and patterns of student mixing to determine the impact and risk of COVID-19 transmission for universities in the United Kingdom. Since their model only targets social patterns and behavior of students contributing to COVID-19 infections, the focus for their mitigation strategies was with reducing the number of students in in-person classroom settings (i.e., increase social distancing), reducing living circles for students, and included regular testing. Although their model only takes into account one parameter from our model, the social distancing measures are in agreement with the exposure risk assessment results from our CEAT analysis. There also have been two independent agent-based models developed to assess SARS-CoV-2 transmission [56] and COVID-19 cases [55] . Similar to the model described above, Phillips et al. [56] agent-based model focuses on SARS-CoV-2 transmission based on children's household sizes in the Ontario childcare centers and school buildings. They have also included parameters to take into account classroom sizes, sibling influence, symptomatic and asymptomatic rates, and physical distancing. Hern\u00e1ndez-Hern\u00e1ndez et al. [55] presented an agent-based model that utilizes the students' community network to predict spread of COVID-19 within a school setting. They also considered the following parameters: 1) status of COVID-19; 2) physical distancing; 3) viral load; 4) hygiene standards; 5) confined spaces; and 6) social interactions. As expected, both models demonstrated the importance of social distancing and following the proper guidelines to prevent spread of COVID-19 which is in agreement with our model. The recently published model by Miller et al. [57] utilizes CDC's COVIDTracer Advanced tool to provide a transmission model for SARS-CoV-2 in schools. They took into account scenarios for infection in the community and public compliance to CDC guidelines to mitigate COVID-19 spread. Similar to other models, they found that social distancing is key to reduce spread and that the COVD-19 community case rate is crucial when assessing exposure risk.",

The case study at NASA ARC has shown that as the push for employer vaccine mandates increases [60] , employers can calculate the potential exposure risk reduction among their workforce compared to the community.

CFD modeling has captured these dynamics [26] [27] [28] . To compensate for the fact that CEAT assumes plumes are non-buoyant, which likely results in CEAT over-predicting concentrations at breathing heights, we adjust the height of the near-field volume to be equal to the distance between the source and the receptor, mixing the emission in all directions and in a larger near-field volume. The anisotropy is more difficult to capture in a model, given that people in groups may be facing in different directions at any point in time and in some events, such as a classroom, people may have a more uniform directionality. Additionally, the direction of the airflow in an indoor space is dependent on the flowrate characteristics of the ventilation system, geometry of the space, geometry and type of air vents, doors, windows, differential heating and cooling, other fans in the building, movement of people, and indoor/outdoor environment interactions. The simple approach used by CEAT to arrive at a concentration, certainly could be improved upon for any specific situations using CFD modeling, however the computational complexity and run times would greatly increase. Experiments that included high temporal and spatial measurement of CO2 from people in a variety of indoor conditions may be useful for testing and optimizing the concentration modeling approach used in CEAT. Experimentation, similar to the studies conducted by Vernez et al. 2021 [65] , but using exhaled CO2 and inert aerosols as tracers, could be accomplished to compare with results obtained using CEAT's algorithms to validate its concentration models and possibly calculate adjustments for the eddy diffusivity.",

This might change the risk assessments since we now know that for both cases the levels of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 reduce over time [69] [70] [71] . However, more research is needed to determine how this impacts the protection against SARS-CoV-2, which is the reason we have not incorporated this parameter into our model at the moment. Additionally, CEAT does not account for the buildup of viral particles between groups utilizing the same space one after another. This limitation will impact groups gathering in a room separately, but sequentially. One way to overcome this limitation is for groups to allow a certain amount of time between occupancy. Calculating the amount of time needed for a ventilation system to remove 99% of contaminants, like that provided by the CDC for infection control in health-care facilities [72] , can allow groups to calculate their exposure risk ratio during separate but successive events. Similarly, groups can estimate their relative risk of back-to-back gatherings by adding the total duration of all meetings throughout the day. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint Table S1 .

Several commonly used methods include well-mixed box (WMB) models [73] , computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models [74] , and gaussian dispersion models [43] . Computational fluid dynamics based models uses numerical solutions of the first principle equations of fluid flow and contaminant transport that are tailored to the specific geometry, scale and temporal lengths, and flow regimes, and are capable of modeling the complexities of particle dynamics, inhalation, exhalation, and interaction with flows in a building [74] . Gaussian models use an explicit solution of the contaminant transport equations, and are, therefore, computationally fast compared to CFD models. Gaussian models are typically used at larger scale lengths (100s of meters or more) and are used in outside environments, not typically used in indoor modeling [75] . The WMB model is a simple model that can be used to estimate concentrations of contaminants in the air. It treats a room as if it were a continuous stirred-tank reactor (CSTR) and uses the basic equations for concentration that were developed for modeling continuous reactors in chemical engineering.",

The superposition principle has been applied to outdoor air pollution dispersion modeling [43] and provides the theoretical basis for modeling complex scenarios involving multiple emission sources in outdoor gaussian plume models such as EPA's AIRMOD [29] . The logic is, therefore, if a NF and FF approach can be used to estimate the higher concentration in the close proximity of one person to another person, then if n people were added to the system, and n additional NF boxes were added, the terms would be added to the equation for each person (i.e., emission source), with each being independent and summing to total concentration, as shown below:",

Using a regular grid of equidistant triangles, as compared to a regular rectangular grid, has advantages since all nodes are equidistant from their nearest neighbors. This equidistant neighbor feature is particularly useful given the objective to assess various distancing options. The use of a triangular grid allows one to conveniently draw a hexagonal prism that is made up of six triangular prisms that approximates a cylinder, with each centered on the six closest nodes to the receptor, (Fig. S3B) .

In most modern buildings, the number of vents would increase with increasing volume or area. Across the range of 235 scenarios that were modeled, the number of vents per 100 m 2 of area ranged from 3.8 to 8 vents per 100 m 2 (excluding the four extreme values of approximately 50 vents per 100 m 2 ), and averaged 4.6 vents per 100 m 2 . To limit the number of variables that the user needs to know or determine to use CEAT, we replace N with a relationship between the area of the room and a reasonable number of vents per unit area, examining values ranging from 3 to 8 vents per 100 m 2 .By combining the two representations of the eddy diffusivity equations and assuming that the product of D and s is a constant, we can calculate an effective velocity (in m min -1 ) that is consistent with a constant eddy diffusivity at all distances from the source.",

In all of the cases, we assume that at least one person is not infectious, so the population that could be infectious is the size of the group, Pe, minus 1.We estimate the community average infectiousness by using the reported 7-day average per 100,000 of diagnosed cases ( 100000 ), an estimate of the ratio of the undiagnosed cases over the diagnosed cases ( ), and the average length of an infectiousness in days, ( ), multiplied by the subgroup factor, which is the adjustment of the subgroup's rate of infectiousness as compared to the rate of infectiousness of the community.",

While CEAT is also based upon a deterministic dose-response framework, it does not use explicit values for emission rate and dose response. Instead it calculates a dose ratio (using Equation S44), based upon comparing a baseline scenario that has been defined as high risk to an evaluated scenario (i.e., i th scenario). This simplification provides a means to rapidly deploy a comprehensive risk model during an infectious disease outbreak ahead of public health and medical authorities having detailed data on the explicit viral emission rates and dose responses. The CEAT model does, however, require that a public health authority (e.g., Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), or other governmental health department) or other expert defines an exposure and dose scenario that is consistent with high risk exposure. In CEAT, we have used the OSHA classifications of exposure risks [34] for this purpose. While the ratio model does not directly use Wells-Riley approach, it does benefit from the data that have been empirically-derived from use of the Wells-Riley approach, allowing us to adjust the CEAT dose ratio results and exposure risk results for various activities and vocalization intensities. We use the back-calculated quanta per hour from Buonanno, et al., 2020a and Buonanno, et al., 2020b to inform the ratio of emission rates, \u0307.",
