The novel coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic transformed health care in the United States to include a telehealth model of care delivery. Clarifying paths through which telehealth technology use is associated with change in provider well-being and interest in sustaining virtual care delivery can inform planning and optimization efforts. Objective This study aimed to characterize provider-reported changes in well-being and daily work associated with the pandemic-accelerated expansion of telehealth and assess the relationship of provider perceptions of telehealth effectiveness, efficiency, and work-life balance with desire for future telehealth. Methods A cross-sectional survey study was conducted October through November 2020, 6 months after the outbreak of COVID-19 at three children's hospitals. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to examine telehealth factors associated with reported change in well-being and desire for future telehealth. Results A total of 947 nontrainee physicians, advanced practice providers, and psychologists were surveyed. Of them, 502 (53.0%) providers responded and 467",

Health services across the United States were swiftly transformed to virtual care delivery, often within a few weeks, encouraged by federal and state emergency actions. 1 Prepandemic, 15% of physicians offered telehealth services and 10% of patients had participated in a telehealth encounter. Between spring and summer 2020, 85% of physicians and 46% of patients reported use of telehealth. 2 Physician stress and burnout, particularly associated with technology use, were issues of considerable interest prepandemic. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In the context of a public health crisis that placed extraordinary responsibilities on health care professionals and contributed to deterioration of work-life happiness, clinician well-being has become an even greater concern. 8, 9 As telehealth adoption and availability grows, so does the need to understand providers' perceptions of its benefits, burdens, and barriers.",

It proposes clinician well-being is determined by a balance between demands and resources, with external system factors more influential than internal individual ones.

These institutions represent two academic tertiary care medical centers (CC: 187 beds and 400,000 annual outpatient visits; and NCH: 625 beds and 1.3 million annual outpatient visits), and one community hospital (ETCH: 152 beds and 120,000 annual outpatient visits). The two larger institutions use an enterprise Epic Electronic Health Record (EHR) platform (Epic Systems Corporation, Verona, Wisconsin, United States) with integrated Zoom video functionality (Zoom Video Communications, San Jose, California, United States); the smallest institution uses a Meditech EHR system (Medical Information Technology Inc., Westwood, Massachusetts, United States) with a nonintegrated Zoom video platform. The study protocol was (49.3%) met inclusion criteria of telehealth use during the study period. Of these, 325 (69.6%) were female, 301 (65.6%) were physicians, and 220 (47.1%) were medical subspecialists. Providers were 4.77 times as likely (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.29-7.06) to report improved versus worsened well-being associated with telehealth. Also, 95.5% of providers (95% CI: 93.2-97.2%) wish to continue performing telehealth postpandemic. Our model explains 66% of the variance in telehealth-attributed provider well-being and 59% of the variance for future telehealth preference and suggests telehealth resources significantly influence provider-perceived telehealth care effectiveness which in turn significantly influences provider well-being and desire to perform telehealth. Conclusion Telehealth has potential to promote provider well-being; telehealthrelated changes in provider well-being are associated with both provider-perceived effectiveness of telemedicine for patients and adequacy of telehealth resources.

NCH chose to include psychology providers, while CC and East Tennessee did not. Consent to participate was implied by survey completion. The provider population for this analysis was limited to physicians, advanced practice nurses, physician assistants, and psychologists who reported active engagement in telehealth between March 1, 2020, and October 31, 2020. Statistical analysis was completed in SPSS version 27 (IBM Corporation) and in R 4.0.2 (R Core Team), using the polychor, lavaan, and psych packages. [24] [25] [26] Provider telehealth-associated well-being was operationalized as the 6-point Likert scale response to \"How has the introduction/expansion of telemedicine affected your professional well-being?\" with responses of \"improved\" or \"greatly improved\" considered positive attributed change. Preference for future telehealth was captured as a 5-point Likert's scale response to \"In an ideal world, how much telemedicine would you provide after COVID-19?\" Burnout was determined via a five-choice single-item validated measure that has been extensively described in previous literature. 27, 28 Statistical Analysis Survey responses were analyzed as standard summary statistics, overall, and by respondent organization to assess for institutional effect. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds of provider-reported improved telehealth-attributed well-being and the odds of provider-reported desire for future telehealth with demographic factors and responses regarding telehealth resources, demands, benefits, and barriers. Analyses made maximal use of available data by omitting missing values by pairwise deletion. Factor analysis and structural equation modeling were performed to incorporate multiple independent variables, extract latent constructs, and simultaneously analyze interrelationships with multiple outcomes of interest. Well-being, future telehealth preference, and burnout were treated as binary and ordered categorical variables without substantive difference between methods. Narrative comments were examined inductively and coded to generate leading qualitative themes by members of the study team.",

Evaluations of the recent telehealth surge and its lessons are beginning to accumulate and should inform data-driven and evidence-based best practices improvement efforts. This study offers evidence that telehealth can promote rather than detract from professional wellbeing for providers by enabling provision of high quality, patient-centric care and offering added flexibility and worklife balance to providers. We found widespread provider's desire to continue telehealth related to a positive perception of how effectively the medium met their patient's needs which, in turn, was influenced by how well an institution provided necessary technical and clinical resources for providers to do their jobs well. Optimizing telehealth structures and workflows to improve reliability, efficiency, and clinical excellence will benefit individuals and health care institutions.",

Absent symptoms of burnout, there was no statistically significant difference in likelihood of improved telehealth-associated well-being between providers who denied and those who endorsed professional stress. Providers with any degree of burnout were significantly less likely to report improved telehealth-attributed well-being. Career stage was not associated with telehealth-associated wellbeing.",
