            "text": "Background: Social stress is an important environmental risk factor for the development of psychiatric disorders, including depression and anxiety disorders. Social stress paradigms are commonly used in rats and mice to gain insight into the pathogenesis of these disorders. The social instability stress (SIS) paradigm entails frequent (up to several times a week) introduction of one or multiple unfamiliar same-sex home-cage partners. The subsequent recurring formation of a new social hierarchy results in chronic and unpredictable physical and social stress. Purpose: We compare and discuss the stress-related behavioral and physiological impact of SIS protocols in rat and mouse, and address limitations due to protocol variability. We further provide practical recommendations to optimize reproducibility of SIS protocols. Methods: We conducted a systematic review in accordance with the PRISMA statement in the following three databases: PubMed, Web of Science and Scopus. Our search strategy was not restricted to year of publication but was limited to articles in English that were published in peer-reviewed journals. Search terms included \"social* instab*\" AND (\"animal\" OR \"rodent\" OR \"rat*\" OR \"mice\" OR \"mouse\"). Results: Thirty-three studies met our inclusion criteria. Fifteen articles used a SIS protocol in which the composition of two cage mates is altered daily for sixteen days (SIS 16D ). Eleven articles used a SIS protocol in which the composition of four cage mates is altered twice per week for 49 days (SIS 49D ). The remaining seven studies used SIS protocols that differed from these two protocols in experiment duration or cage mate quantity. Behavioral impact of SIS was primarily assessed by quantifying depressive-like, anxiety-like, social-, and cognitive behavior. Physiological impact of SIS was primarily assessed using metabolic parameters, hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, and the assessment of neurobiological parameters such as neuroplasticity and neurogenesis. Conclusion: Both shorter and longer SIS protocols induce a wide range of stress-related behavioral and physiological impairments that are relevant for the pathophysiology of depression and anxiety disorders. To date, SIS 16D has only been reported in rats, whereas SIS 49D has only been reported in mice. Given this species-specific application as well as variability in reported SIS protocols, additional studies should determine whether SIS effects are protocol duration-or species-specific. We address several issues, including a lack of consistency in the used SIS protocols, and suggest practical, concrete improvements in design and reporting of SIS protocols to increase standardization and reproducibility of this etiologically relevant preclinical model of social stress.",

Currently, the majority of the global human population lives in very dense urban areas (Zhang, 2016) .

Other stress-related rodent paradigms, such as the chronic unpredictable mild stress paradigm, induce stress by unpredictable alterations in the environment. These include exposure (for at least two weeks) to a variety of stressors in unpredictive order, such as water and/or food deprivation, social isolation or crowding, overnight/stroboscopic illumination, a tilted cage, white noise and/or wet bedding (Willner, 2017; Willner et al., 1992) .",

A straightforward example of this is the rodent species used in the protocol, as rats have a very different natural social structure than mice. Although both rats and mice establish social hierarchies, rats are less territorial and aggressive than mice (Ellenbroek and Youn, 2016) , with especially males differing strikingly in these behaviors (Blanchard et al., 2001) .

Moreover, compiling assessment from multiple tests, preferably that depend on different behavioral or emotional states (e.g. motor versus affective), into a Z score, instead of relying on one test or multiple parameters from the same test, will help provide more conclusive insight regarding the presence of a depressive-like state (Ritov et al., 2016) .",

Locomotor activity can be assessed in a familiar environment (e.g. home-cage) or in a novel environment [e.g. the open field test (OFT)]. To assess adaptive behavior in response to acute stress, the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) can be used (Nestler and Hyman, 2010) . Anxiety-like behavior can be assessed using the elevated plus maze (EPM) and the light-dark box test. Cognitive behavior is generally assessed with the Morris water maze (MWM), object recognition and location, and fear conditioning (Belzung and Griebel, 2001) .",

Another SIS protocol lasted 19 days and cage composition of two mice per cage was also changed daily (Chatterjee et al., 2009) . Two studies applied a 28-day SIS protocol to three animals per cage, and cage composition of mice was changed daily (Dadomo et al., 2018) and cage composition of rats was changed three times a week (Pittet et al., 2017) . Another SIS protocol lasted 35 days and cage composition of five rats per cage was changed daily (Tsai et al., 2014) . One study changed cage composition of six rats per cage three times per week, and SIS lasted either 35 days or 100 days (Eskandari Sedighi et al., 2015) . Lastly, a SIS protocol was applied to ten rats per cage, and cage composition was changed daily for 42 days (Maslova et al., 2010 ). Animals in the control group are commonly housed with the same number of cage mates as the SIS group, but in a consistent manner (i.e. without the frequent cage mate rotation), and sometimes with provision of a clean cage at the same frequency as the SIS group.",

In adolescent male Long-Evans rats, SIS 16D reduced the latency to enter the center during an OFT when measured 3.5 weeks following SIS . In adolescent male Long-Evans rats, SIS 16D increased 10% alcohol intake when measured immediately following SIS, irrespective of the social context during the ethanol intake test, but these effects were minimal when measured again weeks later during adulthood (Marcolin et al., 2019) . Another study from the same group reported no changes in sweetened 10% alcohol intake during intermittent access to ethanol during three weeks following SIS 16D in adolescent male Long-Evans rats (Marcolin et al., 2020) . In a different laboratory, SIS 16D applied to adolescent male or female Long-Evans rats also did not impact ethanol intake at various timepoints following SIS (Roeckner et al., 2017) .

SIS 49D applied to adult male and female C57BL/6J mice reduced distance travelled in the light compartment in the light-dark box test, independent of sex (Yohn et al., 2019) , whereas 11-day SIS applied to adolescent male Balb/c mice did not affect risk-taking behavior when tested twenty days following SIS (de Lima and Massoco, 2017) . Several articles report that SIS in mice did not affect (novelty-induced) locomotor activity in the OFT, and this was independent of SIS protocol duration or timing of the OFT (Dadomo et al., 2018; de Lima and Massoco, 2017; Scharf et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2010a; Sterlemann et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2019) . However, when measured five weeks following SIS 49D in adolescent male CD1 mice, SIS vulnerable mice were hyperactive during the first three minutes of the OFT compared to SIS resilient mice and non-stressed controls (Schmidt et al., 2010b) . Additionally, SIS 49D applied to adolescent male or female CD1 mice decreased (initial) locomotor activity compared to non-stressed controls when measured two months or roughly a week following SIS (Saavedra-Rodr\u00edguez and Feig, 2013; Schmidt et al., 2007) . Remarkably, the hypoactivity during the OFT following an effect that was more pronounced in the F0 females than F0 males, was transmitted to the F1 offspring by mothers and fathers but only to F2 and F3 daughters by fathers (Saavedra-Rodr\u00edguez and Feig, 2013) . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male or female C57BL/6J mice also decreased the distance travelled in the center zone of the open field arena in stressed male and female mice compared to non-stressed controls when measured several weeks after the SIS protocol, and this anxiogenic effect was dependent on the estrous cycle in female mice (Yohn et al., 2019) . In contrast, SIS 49D , albeit a slightly modified version with random cage distribution, applied to two large cohorts of adolescent male C57BL/6J mice consistently increased time spent in the center zone of the open field arena compared to non-stressed controls, when measured during the active (dark) phase five weeks following SIS (Sturman et al., 2021) . During the novelty suppressed feeding test, SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice or adolescent male and female C57BL/6J mice consistently increased latency to initiate food consumption (Schmidt et al., 2007 (Schmidt et al., , 2010a Sterlemann et al., 2008; Yohn et al., 2019) . This change in feeding latency was not observed one year following SIS 49D in adolescent male CD1 mice .",

However, between-day (i.e. between the first trial of the day and last trail of the previous day) performance during acquisition learning was decreased in stressed rats compared to non-stressed controls, indicating that SIS produces a modest impairment in long-term spatial memory, but not in short-term or working memory when tested six weeks following SIS . This impairment in long-term spatial memory was confirmed using the object recognition test or object location test in additional studies with adolescent male and female Long-Evans rats when tested immediately or four weeks following SIS McCormick et al., 2010 McCormick et al., , 2012 . Additionally, SIS 16D applied to adolescent male Long-Evans rats decreases the latency to approach an object and the total time interacting with the object when tested six weeks following SIS . SIS also affects contextual short-term memory, as SIS 16D applied to adolescent male and female Long-Evans rats decreases freezing behavior during a fearful context in adolescent rats when tested immediately or four weeks following SIS (McCormick et al., 2013b; Morrissey et al., 2011) . However, such a memory impairment was not observed when the SIS 16D protocol was applied during adulthood (Marcolin et al., 2020; Morrissey et al., 2011) . Thirty-five-day SIS, applied either to adolescent or adult male Sprague-Dawley rats, produced more fear-potentiated startle behavior compared to non-stressed controls when tested immediately following SIS (Tsai et al., 2014) . In contrast, 42-day SIS did not immediately affect acoustic startle behavior in adolescent male Wistar rats, with stressed rats even showing less startle behavior compared to non-stressed controls, when measured more than two months after SIS (Maslova et al., 2010) .",

Twenty-eight-day SIS applied to adult female Sprague Dawley rats resulted in less aggression towards a social stimulus compared to controls (Pittet et al., 2017) . Furthermore, 28-day SIS did not affect maternal aggression towards a male intruder, although stressed rats did groom their pups significantly more during the presence of the intruder (Pittet et al., 2017) . Finally, the 28-day SIS did not affect general maternal care (e.g. grooming, licking and nursing) (Pittet et al., 2017) . SIS 16D applied to adolescent male Long-Evans rats impaired sexual behavior throughout adulthood as stressed rats show less sexual behavior in general, had a longer latency to ejaculate and a lower total amount of ejaculations (McCormick et al., 2013a) . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice increased aggressive behavior compared to non-stressed controls (Schmidt et al., 2007) . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male and female CD1 mice reduced direct social interactions with a same-sex juvenile compared to non-stressed controls when measured two months following SIS (Saavedra- Rodr\u00edguez and Feig, 2013) . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice did not affect social interaction time with a male DBA mouse (Scharf et al., 2013) or the time spent in the chamber containing a same-sex stranger in the three-chambered social interaction test, in either male or female CD1 mice stressed during adolescence (Saavedra-Rodr\u00edguez and Feig, 2013) .

Several articles report no effect of SIS 49D on body weight growth in adolescent male CD1 mice (Scharf et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2007 Schmidt et al., , 2010b . However, two articles report decreased body weight growth either after SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice (Boleij et al., 2014) or after 19-day SIS applied to young-adult male SJL mice (Chatterjee et al., 2009) . The lag in body weight growth was normalized within two weeks following SIS 49D (Boleij et al., 2014) . Twenty-eight-day SIS applied to adult female CD1 mice decreases body weight gain and reduces caloric intake compared to non-stressed controls (Dadomo et al., 2018) . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice followed by twelve months of individual housing decreased subcutaneous white adipose tissue and visceral-to-subcutaneous white adipose tissue ratios, and these effects were prevented by paroxetine treatment during SIS 49D (Schmidt et al., 2009) . Furthermore, SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice generally increases adrenal weight and decreases thymus weight compared to non-stressed controls (Scharf et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2007 Schmidt et al., , 2010a Schmidt et al., , 2010b Sterlemann et al., 2008) . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice also induces an impoverished fur condition, indicative of decreased general health in stressed mice compared to non-stressed controls (Boleij et al., 2014; Schmidt et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "In short, SIS severely impacts HPA-axis function in mice, independent of whether SIS 49D or 19-day SIS had been applied. Accordingly, SIS applied to mice affected gene expression of several stress behaviorrelated genes in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus and the hippocampus. In rats, the data on SIS effects on HPA-axis function are inconsistent and minimal. This inconsistency appears independent of SIS protocol duration. SIS 16D resulted in elevated, unaltered, and decreased plasma CORT levels when applied to adolescent male Long-Evans rats when measured at baseline, after fear conditioning, or after fear recall, respectively (Marcolin et al., 2020) . SIS 16D did not alter plasma CORT levels when applied to adolescent male and female Long-Evans rats when measured after an acute stressor (McCormick et al., 2008; Roeckner et al., 2017) , but did result in lower CORT levels when applied to adolescent male, but not female, Long-Evans rats when measured at the end of SIS (McCormick et al., 2007) . Forty-two-day SIS applied to adolescent male Wistar rats did not affect plasma CORT levels when measured six weeks following SIS (Maslova et al., 2010) , whereas 35-day SIS and 100-day SIS applied to adult male Wistar rats induced elevated plasma CORT levels compared to non-stressed controls (Eskandari Sedighi et al., 2015) . SIS 16D applied to adolescent male Long-Evans rats increased Crh expression in the PVN compared to non-stressed controls (McCormick et al., 2007) . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice and 19-day SIS applied to young-adult male SJL mice increased plasma CORT levels in stressed mice compared to non-stressed controls (Chatterjee et al., 2009; Scharf et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2007 Schmidt et al., , 2010a Schmidt et al., , 2010b Sterlemann et al., 2008; Yohn et al., 2019) . Most studies assessed plasma CORT levels immediately following the end of SIS. Following SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice, plasma CORT elevations either returned to baseline after one week of individual housing (Schmidt et al., 2007) or stayed elevated after five weeks of individual housing (Scharf et al., 2013) . The latter effect was absent following paroxetine treatment (Scharf et al., 2013) . Circadian rhythms impact CORT dynamics, and SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice increases CORT levels in stressed mice compared to non-stressed controls in the morning (Scharf et al., 2013; Sterlemann et al., 2008) . In line with these circadian aspects, SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice decreases plasma ACTH levels in the morning, whereas plasma ACTH was not affected in the evening (Schmidt et al., 2007) . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice increases CORT/ACTH ratios, indicative of a dysregulated HPA-axis (Schmidt et al., 2007 (Schmidt et al., , 2010a . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice decreases or lowers Crh expression in the PVN, and these effects appear both immediate and long-lasting (Scharf et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2010a) . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice also decreases Nr3c1 and Nr3c2 expression in the hippocampus, a brain region implicated in (spatial) memory (Scharf et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2007 Schmidt et al., , 2010a Sterlemann et al., 2008) . Similar effects were observed in another study with adolescent male CD1 mice, but these effects appear dependent on whether mice had been tested in a behavioral assay before the assessment of gene expression (Boleij et al., 2014) . Alterations in Nr3c1 or Nr3c2 expression were only present when measured directly after SIS 49D , but when measured one month or one year after SIS, expression levels normalized again or even appeared increased (Scharf et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2010b; Sterlemann et al., 2008) . SIS 49D applied to adolescent male CD1 mice increased Avp expression when measured immediately or twelve months following SIS (Scharf et al., 2013; Sterlemann et al., 2008) .",

            "text": "SIS 16D applied to adolescent male and female Sprague Dawley rats reduced apical branch length and number in females and basal dendritic length and dendritic quantity in males compared to non-stressed controls (Breach et al., 2019) . In addition, 35-day SIS applied to adolescent male Sprague Dawley rats decreased these parameters when applied during adolescence, but increased these parameters when applied during adulthood (Tsai et al., 2014) . Furthermore, SIS 16D applied to adolescent male Long-Evans rats decreased neuronal activation (quantified as cFos-positive cells) in the PVN and arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, two brain regions implicated in stress behavior-related, compared to non-stressed controls when tested one day following SIS and following a brief social interaction test (Hodges et al., 2018) . Despite these observations, no differences in neuronal activity (quantified as cFos-positive cells) were observed in brain areas related to social-behavior, including the medial amygdala, lateral septum, the CA2 subregion of the hippocampus, and the nucleus accumbens (Hodges et al., 2018) . SIS 16D applied to adolescent male Long-Evans rats impacted hippocampal synaptic plasticity during adulthood, as expression of CaMKIIa and CaMKIIb, markers of synaptic plasticity, was increased in the dorsal hippocampus of stressed rats compared to non-stressed controls when tested four weeks following SIS (McCormick et al., 2012) . In the same study, SIS 16D had minimal impact on hippocampal expression of T286a/b and Synaptophysin, additional marker of synaptic plasticity, compared to non-stressed controls (McCormick et al., 2012) . The finding that SIS 16D impaired plasticity in the hippocampus, a region important for spatial memory, is expected given the earlier mentioned impairments in spatial memory (McCormick et al., 2012) . SIS 16D applied to adolescent male Long-Evans rats did not impact synaptic plasticity in the nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex (as assessed using the markers Spinophilin, PSD95 and CaMKIIIa/b) when tested immediately following SIS (Marcolin et al., 2020 ). However, when tested four weeks following SIS, SIS 16D applied to adolescent male Long-Evans rats was associated with lower CaMKIIIa and PSD95, but not CaMKIIIb or Spinophilin, in the prefrontal cortex compared to non-stressed controls, without affecting these markers in the nucleus accumbens or dorsal or ventral hippocampus (Marcolin et al., 2020) . Thirty-five-day SIS applied to adolescent or adult male Sprague Dawley rats decreased and increased, respectively, full-length brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in the amygdala, a region known for processing emotions such as anxiety and aggression, compared to their respective controls when tested immediately following SIS (Tsai et al., 2014) . Furthermore, the same study reports that truncated BDNF was increased in adult rats, SNAP-25 was decreased in adolescent rats, and Synaptogamin-1 was unaltered at both ages, compared to controls (Tsai et al., 2014) . SIS negatively impacts neuronal development in the amygdala of the adolescent brain (as indicated by altered dendritic field and spine density of basolateral amygdala neurons), whereas amygdala neurons in adult rats seem more capable of adapting to SIS (Tsai et al., 2014) . SIS 16D applied to adolescent male Long-Evans rats increased the number of hippocampal Ki67-positive cells when tested three days after the start of SIS (McCormick et al., 2012 ). However, when tested immediately or four weeks following SIS, hippocampal Ki67-positive cells were unaltered, whereas DCX-positive neurons were increased, compared to non-stressed controls (McCormick et al., 2012) . SIS 16D applied to adolescent female Long-Evans rats decreased the number of hippocampal BrdU-positive cells compared to non-stressed controls when tested four days following SIS (McCormick et al., 2010) . Furthermore, 100-day SIS applied to adult Wistar rats decreased cytoskeletal microtubular system in the brain (Eskandari Sedighi et al., 2015) , which is essential for functions such as learning and memory (Bianchi et al., 2006) , and neuronal plasticity (Bianchi et al., 2005) . However, in the same study, these changes were not observed after 35-day SIS (Eskandari Sedighi et al., 2015) . SIS 49D applied to adult male and female C57BL/6J mice decreased the number of hippocampal Ki67-positive neurons in males and females, without hippocampal DCX-positive cells were only decreased in females when tested five weeks following SIS (Yohn et al., 2019) . Nineteen-day SIS applied to young-adult male SJL mice induced complex changes in subunits of big potassium (BK) channels, which are involved in BK channel excitability, in the adrenal medulla and pituitary gland (Chatterjee et al., 2009).

This systematic review evaluated 33 articles, of which the majority applies the SIS 16D or SIS 49D protocol. To date, SIS 16D has only been applied to rats, whereas SIS 49D has only been applied to mice. Nonetheless, several articles reported the impact of relative short SIS protocols (e.g. 11 or 19 days) in mice (Chatterjee et al., 2009; de Lima and Massoco, 2017) or relative long SIS protocols (e.g. 35 or 42 days) in rats (Eskandari Sedighi et al., 2015; Maslova et al., 2010) . Despite severely limited in number, these studies do facilitate a careful comparison between the effectiveness of relative short and long SIS protocols in mice or rats.",

Variation in methodological design includes differences in species, strain, protocol length, age, cage density, cage change frequency, isolation between cage change, and (timing of) molecular/behavioral readout. We thus echo the sentiment that establishment of a standardized SIS protocol would increase reproducibility and thus utility of this etiologically relevant stress model (Go\u00f1i-Balentziaga et al., 2018; Lopez and Bagot, 2021) . Due to the limited number of articles with relative short SIS protocols in mice and relative long SIS protocols in rats, a conclusive comparison of different protocol duration effectiveness is currently not possible without having species-specific differences as a confounding factor (see Fig. 3 ).",

Notably, SIS protocols induced depressive-like behavior in mice (de Lima and Massoco, 2017; Wang et al., 2019) , but this was not observed in rats (Marcolin et al., 2019; Maslova et al., 2010; McCormick et al., 2013b) . Several studies consistently report that SIS deteriorates cognitive capacities in rats Hodges et al., 2017 Hodges et al., , 2018 Marcolin et al., 2020; McCormick et al., 2010 McCormick et al., , 2012 , whereas only one study suggests a cognitive impairment in mice (Sterlemann et al., 2010) . To date, neuron morphology has only been investigated in rats (Breach et al., 2019; Eskandari Sedighi et al., 2015; Hodges et al., 2018; Marcolin et al., 2020; McCormick et al., 2012; Tsai et al., 2014) , whereas gene expression has only been investigated in mice (Boleij et al., 2014; Scharf et al., 2013; Schmidt et al., 2007 Schmidt et al., , 2010a Schmidt et al., , 2010b Sterlemann et al., 2008) . As several parameters have not been consistently investigated in both species, and because relative short SIS protocols are generally applied to rat and relative long SIS protocols to mouse, a comprehensive comparison of the species-specific effects of SIS is currently not possible. Additional studies are needed to fill this literature gap and enable a proper comparison between different SIS protocol durations in mouse and rat.",

During SIS 16D , each cage contains two rats, whereas during SIS 49D , each cage contains four mice. The social density of a cage can affect several stress-related measures, as studies indicate that greater cage density is associated with elevated plasma CORT and increased adrenal weight (Laber et al., 2008; Paigen et al., 2012) . However, several SIS protocols with different cage densities (e.g. 5 rats/cage or 2 rats/cage) induce similar behavioral and physiological stress-related alterations (Breach et al., 2019; de Lima and Massoco, 2017; Tsai et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2019) . In addition, SIS protocols with similar cage density, but different experiment duration and/or species, had differential effects on anxiety-like behavior (de Lima and Massoco, 2017; Roeckner et al., 2017; Schmidt et al., 2010a; Sterlemann et al., 2008) , suggesting that protocol duration might a dominant factor over cage density. Furthermore, a 35-day SIS protocol in rat, housing ten animals per cage, produced minimal behavioral and physiological alterations (Maslova et al., 2010) . Thus, it is possible that this number of animals per cage functions as a social buffer, as previous research has shown that social presence and/or physical contact can reduce stress-related physiological effects (Morrison, 2016) , therefore potentially diminishing the negative effects of SIS.",

Eleven studies investigate the long-lasting effect of SIS (assessed eight days or later; Fig. 3B ). Eleven studies investigate both the immediate and long-lasting effect of SIS (see Fig. 3A and B). Thirty-five days after the end of the SIS 49D protocol, plasma CORT levels in one cohort of stressed mice remained elevated compared to non-stressed controls (Schmidt et al., 2010b) , whereas the same laboratory had previously reported that the increases in plasma CORT levels returned to baseline within a week (Schmidt et al., 2007) . Such differential observations can potentially be explained by individual differences to SIS susceptibility (see Interindividual differences of SIS section below), especially since the used mouse cohorts were from the CD1 outbred strains and this strain might have higher variability due to genetic predispositions than inbred strains. It could also be explained by differing general aggression levels between both SIS cohorts (also see Strengths and limitations section below).",

Taken together, these findings emphasize the importance of consistent timing of behavioral and physiological assessment. It is possible that behavioral and/or physiological alterations are sometimes missed because they develop after tests have been performed. Conclusiveness could be achieved by measuring physiological and behavioral parameters at multiple timepoints following the SIS protocol (e.g. also six weeks later).

During this important developmental phase, social play behavior peaks in both humans and rodents and more time is spent on social interaction relative to other ages (Spear, 2000) . Likewise, the consequences of mental health disorders, such as depression, during adolescence are severe and long-lasting as relapse rates are approximately 60% (Birmaher et al., 2002; Ginsburg et al., 2014) . Adolescents have a general higher risk to develop mental health disorders and this is dependent on their perception of social stress levels (Mason et al., 2016) . Coping mechanisms for stress also develop during adolescence (Sachser et al., 2011) . Therefore, this vulnerable age group may particularly benefit from mechanistic insight of studies conducting SIS protocols during adolescence, as this paradigm was created in order to investigate the effects of chronic stress exposure during adolescence. In line with this, the age of experimental animals during SIS (adolescent versus adult) is an important factor when interpreting the efficiency of SIS to induce stress-related (mal)adaptations. Thus, future studies hold great promise to investigate the underlying mechanisms in the development of mental health disorders during adolescence, and the protective potential of behavioral (e.g. exercise training) or pharmacological interventions.",

The authors suggest that the different observations in these two cohorts results from variability in susceptibility to the SIS protocol (Marcolin et al., 2020) . As previously mentioned, it is likely that some variation can be assigned to individual differences in stress susceptibility. However, the substantial size of both cohorts (i.e. 96 and 100 rats respectively), make it unlikely that these differences are solely the consequence of individual differences in SIS susceptibility.",

The stress-induced behavioral and physiological alterations were transferred when a single parent was exposed to SIS 49D , but the trans-generational effects of SIS were strongest when both the mother and father had experiences SIS. Thus, parental SIS alters the behavior and physiology of (unstressed) offspring, and these effects were apparent for several generations (Saavedra-Rodr\u00edguez and Feig, 2013) .

The exclusion of studies that directly combined SIS and another stressor (e.g. early-life stress or predator exposure) or that did not include a SIS-only control group (see Supplemental Table 1 ), allowed an attempt to compare the effectiveness of various SIS protocols. However, most articles used the SIS 16D or SIS 49D protocol and these protocols have been applied specifically to either rat or mouse, respectively. Due to this limited application of relative short SIS protocols in rats and relative long SIS protocols in mice, findings from relative short SIS protocols can be minimally translated to relative long SIS protocols and vice versa. Furthermore, not all studies adequately report at what exact age the behavioral and physiological tests were performed or when the rodents were sacrificed. Including such important information, for example by reporting studies according to the ARRIVE guidelines, would cover the essential requirements for proper reproducibility and enable better comparisons (Percie du Sert et al., 2020) . Altogether, this review provides a comparative overview of the current SIS protocol literature in rat and mouse, identifies remaining gaps in the literature, and provide practical recommendations to optimize reproducibility of SIS protocols.",

In addition, the recurring changes in home-cage hierarchy continue to produce unpredictable social stress, which should maintain sensitivity to the social stress. SIS protocols are also easy to upscale, making it potentially high-throughput, and are relatively low in labor intensity. A SIS protocol works with a minimal cage density of two, but cage density can be increased to upscale the number of experimental animals. One should however note that the number of cage mates, as well as cage area size, will likely impact the aggressiveness of the animals and will thus impact the intensity of the social stress. A SIS protocol can last multiple weeks to months, making it a bonafide chronic stress model. Because of the easiness to apply SIS protocols for a longer duration, social stress can be applied to adolescent animals and last into adulthood. This allows for the possibility to study the effects of social stress spanning multiple ages. When started during adulthood compared to adolescence, SIS is often associated with more aggression. Males also demonstrate more aggression during SIS, especially during adulthood, compared to females. Although one should always carefully monitor the health of each individual experimental animal, this is especially true for SIS cohorts of (adult) males.",

Although it is easy to upscale a SIS protocol, a substantial number of animals is minimally needed to ensure that experimental animals are always forming a new hierarchy with (an) unfamiliar cage mate(s). This large minimal number of animals also makes it less applicable to study the influence of genetic factors (e.g. in a transgenic line) on SIS susceptibility, as it requires substantial breeding cohorts. The very large number of animals needed for a SIS protocol also makes it challenging to test males and females at the same time, and to directly compare sexspecific effects. The chronic nature of longer SIS protocols, and the possibility to study the effects of social stress spanning multiple ages, can also be a disadvantage as it limits the possibility to study the deleterious effects of SIS during a specific age. Finally, the presence of one or multiple females in the home-cage or in the housing room will increase aggression levels in males, and separate rooms for male and female cohorts are thus recommended.",

Establishment of a standardized SIS protocol is important to increase utility of this etiologically relevant stress model (also see Box 2). Comprehensive analysis of the behavioral and physiological (mal)adaptations following such a standardized protocol, and the contribution of interindividual differences (including social rank), will provide valuable insight into the role of (chronic) social stress in the development and pathophysiology of depressive-and anxiety disorders.
