This may have contributed to the improved survival that has been noted among ICU-treated covid -19 patients. In an ICU study of covid-19 patients in England, Wales and Northern Ireland by Doidge et al., 8 a decline in 28-day mortality was noted from 43.5% before the peak of the first pandemic wave to 34.3% after the peak.

The reasons for these variations are not known, but a number of factors may have contributed to those and to the overall decline in mortality. First, improvements of management and care have probably been of great importance for the declining mortality. For instance, the present study shows that even though acute severity of illness (SAPS3) among ICU-treated patients remained unchanged over time, the proportion of patients managed in the prone position increased, and the proportion receiving invasive mechanical ventilation decreased (table 3). During the study period the drug therapy of patients with covid-19 changed continuously. In March 2020, many covid-19 patients in Sweden received off-label treatment with chloroquine phosphate/hydroxychloroquine, 21 until this use was stopped by the European Medicines Agency on April 1. However, this use may not have affected outcome, since a randomised control trial (RCT) by Horby et al. 22 found that patients treated with hydroxychloroquine had similar mortality as those receiving standard of care treatment. In March and early April, publications showed that anticoagulant therapy with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) was associated with a better prognosis 23 and that thromboembolic events occurred despite standard doses thromboprophylaxis. 24 Accordingly, high-dose LMWH treatment became standard in Swedish ICUs in April. We are still awaiting the results of ongoing RCT of LMWH at different doses (NCT04345848; NCT04344756) 25 , so we do not yet know the impact of high-dose LMWH on outcome. Corticosteroids became standard care for covid-19",

            "text": "in March-May suggests that corticosteroids were unlikely to be a major cause for the decline in mortality among ICU patients. Second, the high load of new admissions and of patients in hospital care for covid-19 in March and April (fig 2) may have contributed to the high initial mortality. This notion is supported by the result from healthcare region Stockholm-Gotland, which had the highest number of new covid-19 admissions/population in March-April (table E4) and also the clearest decline in mortality (fig E6). Third, the decline in mortality may have been due to a change in the selection of covid-19 patients for hospital care. Among hospitalised covid-19 patients in the present study, the proportion admitted to ICU and receiving invasive mechanical ventilation decreased substantially over time (fig 6). In addition, the proportion of patients without comorbidity (CCI zero) increased significantly over time. These aspects indicate that the overall hospitalised covid-19 population was gradually less severely ill. This explanation is supported by an Italian study of covid-19 patients diagnosed in the emergency department between March and May, showing that the SARS-CoV-2 viral load in the upper respiratory tract gradually decreased and the proportion of patients requiring ICU care decreased over time. 27 Fourth, the decline in mortality could perhaps be due to changes in virulence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Young et al. 28 showed that a major deletion in the SARS-CoV-2 genome was associated with milder infection. 28 Among 521 virus strains in Sweden with complete genome sequences, 19 different SARS-CoV-2 strain sequences were identified, 11 of which were identified in strains collected in March only. 29 It will be important to investigate if the most prevalent SARS-CoV-2 strains in May and June had an inherent reduced virulence or had undergone genetic changes that reduced virulence. The results of the present study, showing declining mortality over time in both non-ICU treated and ICU treated patients, combined with some previous studies showing declining mortality among ICU treated patients 8,12 , shed new light on covid-19 mortality and enables a more appropriate evaluation of the management of the pandemic. For instance, in studies using mortality as endpoint, the timing of inclusion may play a crucial role regarding outcome. The results of before-and-after studies on specific interventions should thus be",
