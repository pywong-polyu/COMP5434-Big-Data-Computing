Indeed, emergency clinical trials have been launched to assess the effectiveness of many marketed drugs, tackling the decrease of viral load through several mechanisms. Here, we present an online resource, based on small-molecule bioactivity signatures and natural language processing, to expand the portfolio of compounds with potential to treat COVID-19. By comparing the set of drugs reported to be potentially active against SARS-CoV-2 to a universe of 1 million bioactive molecules, we identify compounds that display analogous chemical and functional features to the current COVID-19 candidates. Searches can be filtered by level of evidence and mechanism of action, and results can be restricted to drug molecules or include the much broader space of bioactive compounds. Moreover, we allow users to contribute COVID-19 drug candidates, which are automatically incorporated to the pipeline once per day.

The COVID-19 pandemic has prompted an unprecedented effort by the scientific community to understand its molecular constituents and find an effective treatment to mitigate viral infectiveness and symptoms. This is reflected in the over 6000 COVID-related publications that appeared in the past few weeks. 3 Huge efforts are being invested in the discovery of an effective vaccine, but even the most optimistic scenarios suggest that it will not be available until 2021. Other drug discovery projects have been launched to target specific viral proteins, particularly its main protease (Mpro). 4 However, these initiatives, even if successful, could take even longer to deliver an approved drug. Thus, the repurposing of existing drugs is our best chance to face the current outbreak therapeutically, since approved drugs have known safety profiles and are ready to be tested in humans. For instance, several compounds initially developed to treat HIV (e.g., lopinavir/ritonavir) 5 or Ebola (e.g., remdesivir), 6 as well as antimalarial drugs (e.g., hydroxychloroquine), 7 are being tested against COVID-19. Indeed, we conducted a limited review of the most relevant scientific literature and identified over 200 compounds that are potentially active against COVID-19 with different levels of experimental support, from purely computational predictions to preclinical and drugs already in clinical trials.",

The mechanisms of action (MoA) suggested to confer efficacy are also variable, ranging from immunomodulators to protease inhibitors.

We then use statistics of the score distribution of top scoring documents to rank the bioassays. And (ii), we manually labeled a set of (seed) molecules that tested positive in \u223c100 bioassays relevant to COVID-19. We then automatically identify compounds from all the bioassay descriptions and compute their contextual embeddings. Finally, we rank the bioassays according to their cosine similarity to the seed molecules. We then keep the 1000 most relevant COVID-19 literature bioassays, as ranked by either text-mining approach and identify those bioactive molecules within the CC universe that tested positive (<10 \u03bcM) in at least one of them. Finally, we cross these results with the 10,000 compounds obtained from the similarity searches described above and assign an extra literature-evidence level (text-mining) to those in common, which are then used as bait compounds.",

We see that, while significantly diverse, COVID-19 bait compounds cluster in certain regions of the chemical space, and we find new candidate molecules in their vicinity. Reassuringly, when we analyze the therapeutic categories of the top-ranked candidates, as expected, we retrieve a significant number of anti-infective drugs ( Figure  4A ). Other therapeutic categories such as hormonal treatments are enriched after the highest-ranking compounds. Note that, for this enrichment analysis, only drug molecules could be considered since ATC annotations are not available for most of the compounds in the CC. Finally, we perform a leave-one-out cross-validation to assess whether bait compounds can be retrieved by our similarity search.
