A 2010 survey of over 12 000 people from 12 countries reported that 75% of respondents search for health information online, 1 with some twothirds of patients in 2017 reporting that they 'google' their symptoms before going to the doctor's office. 2 However, online search tools like Google or Bing were not intended to provide medical advice and risk offering irrelevant or misleading information. 3 One potential solution is dedicated symptom assessment applications (ie, apps), [3] [4] [5] [6] which use a structured interview or multiple-choice format to ask patients questions about their demographic, relevant medical history, symptoms, and presentation. In the first few screening questions, some symptom assessment apps Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The study included a large number of vignettes which were peer reviewed by independent and experienced primary care physicians to minimise bias. \u25ba General practitioners and apps were tested with vignettes in a manner that simulates real clinical consultations. \u25ba Detailed source data verification was carried out. \u25ba Vignette entry was conducted by professionals as a recent study found that laypeople are less good at entering vignettes for symptoms that they have never experienced. \u25ba Limitations include the lack of a rigorous and comprehensive selection process to choose the eight apps and the lack of real patient experience assessment.",

Exclusion limits the range of users for whom the app can be turned to for advice, but, depending on the market segment the app manufacturer wants to address, having a narrow coverage may be appropriate, and it may in certain circumstances have advantages, for example, if it was a requirement of a regulatory authority within a certain jurisdiction, or, if it was possible to design the app with greater usability by narrowing its focus. Assuming the patient is not excluded, these software tools use a range of computational approaches to suggest one or more conditions that might explain the symptoms (eg, common cold vs pneumonia). Many symptom assessment apps then suggest next steps that patients should take (levels of urgency advice, for example, self-care at home vs seek urgent consultation), often along with evidence-based condition information for the user.",

            "text": "A recent systematic review of the literature identified that rigorous studies are required to show that these apps provide safe and reliable information 4 in the context for which they were designed and for which they have regulatory approval. Most previous studies considered only a single symptom assessment app, focused on specific (often specialty) conditions, had a small number of vignettes (<50), were relatively uncontrolled in the nature of the cases presented, and suffered a high degree of bias. 4 For example, a previous study examined the performance of the Mediktor app in the emergency department (ED) waiting room. 7 While this is a valid setting, most apps were designed and approved for use primarily at home and for newly presenting problems; accordingly, some 38.7% of patients had to be excluded. Few studies have systematically compared symptom assessment apps to one another in this context, which is particularly important as apps may increasingly be used to supplement or replace telephone triage. 4 This is particularly relevant in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic-early in the spread of COVID-19, healthcare facilities risked being overwhelmed and furthering contagion, so communication strategies were needed to provide patients with advice without face-toface contact. 8 9 In contrast to deploying apps in a heterogeneous realworld setting, where participants would not have the time to re-enter their symptoms multiple times, and may not receive a verifiable diagnosis, clinical vignettes studies allow direct comparison of interapp and app-to-GP performance. [10] [11] [12] Clinical vignettes are created to represent patients, these are reviewed and then assigned goldstandard answers for main and differential diagnoses and for triage. The clinical vignettes are then used to test both apps and GPs. GPs are assessed through mock telephone consultations and apps through their normal question flow. 3 6 Clinical vignettes studies have the advantage of enabling direct GP-to-app comparison, allowing a wide range of case types to be explored, and are generalisable to 'real-life' situations, but are complementary to, not a replacement for, real-patient studies. 4 10 12 Seminal work at Harvard Medical School has established the value of such approaches but has not been updated recently. 3 6 The objective of the current study was to compare the coverage, suggested condition accuracy, and urgency advice accuracy of GPs and eight popular symptom assessment apps which provide, for a general population, condition suggestions and urgency advice: Ada, Babylon, Buoy, K Health, Mediktor, Symptomate, WebMD, and Your.MD. We had three primary hypotheses: 1. That GPs would have better performance than the apps in the three metrics of (a) condition suggestion accuracy, (b) appropriateness of urgency advice and (c) safety of urgency advice. 2. That performance of each app would be consistent across the three metrics (condition-suggestion accuracy, appropriateness and safety of urgency advice). 3. That apps would differ from one another in their performance across the three metrics. Exploration of these hypotheses is important for users of the applications and for physicians.",

The vignette creation team also included two GPs (SU and AB-employees of Ada Health), each with over 5 years primary care and ED experience. SU and AB had worked for the Ada Health telehealth service Dr Chat but were not involved in the development of Ada's medical intelligence. The vignettes were designed to include both common and less-common conditions relevant to primary care practice, and to include clinical presentations and conditions affecting all body systems. They were created to be fair cases representing real-world situations in which a member of the public might seek medical information or advice from a symptom assessment app, or present to primary care. Most of the clinical vignettes were newly presenting problems experienced by an individual or by a child in their care, and they included some patients with chronic conditions, for example, diabetes, hypertension, and so on (see online supplemental tables 1-3).",

The remaining 68.0% of the vignettes were created by the vignette creation team (JC, SU and AB), including joint assignment of the most appropriate main diagnosis and differential diagnoses, as a starting point for the vignette gold-standard answers. The vignettes included the sex and age of the patient, previous medical history (including factors such as pregnancy, smoking, high blood pressure, diabetes, other illnesses), the named primary complaint, additional information on the primary complaint and current symptoms, and information to be provided only 'if asked' by the tested-GP or symptom assessment app (see online supplemental table 3) . Each vignette was created with a list of gold standard correct conditions, arrived at through the majority decision of the vignette creation panel. This list included a main diagnosis and a list of other differential diagnoses (generally between one and four, but length-varying per vignette, as appropriate to the clinical history).",

Of these limitations, only one applies to this study-the limitation of being based on clinical vignettes rather than on real-patient data. The effect of this limitation has been minimised through the development of many of the vignettes to be highly realistic through the use of anonymised real patient data collated from NHS Direct transcripts. The use of real patient data with an actual diagnosis is not without Open access its limitations in the evaluation of symptom assessment app accuracy as it relies on face-to-face consultation to confirm diagnosis. Very often diagnosis is only provided after physical examination or diagnostic tests, so comparison is confounded as the real patient diagnosis is based on additional information not made available to the app. The vignettes approach has allowed this study to be designed to minimise the limitations (2)-(5) identified by Chambers et al. 4 This has been done for limitation (2) through inclusion of a 7-GP comparator group; for limitation (3) by development of vignettes for conditions spanning all body systems and sampling all medical specialisms relevant to primary care presentation; for limitation (4) by designing clinical vignettes including not-only simple and common situations, but also moderately complex and challenging presentations; for limitation (5) through including vignettes spanning from 1 month to 89 years old. -see online supplemental  table 6 for a subanalysis of fully verified data, which shows the same trend of results and no significant difference to the data recorded here.

Another strength of this study is that GPs were tested with vignettes in a manner that simulates real clinical consulting-in this way the GPs consultation process was assessed, enabling a fair comparison to the apps. Vignettes were entered into the apps by eight additional primary care physicians acting as the user (app-entry-Dr-1-8). A physician also 'acted' as the patient being assessed by the GPs in the phone consultations. It has been argued that lay-person entry is closest to the real intended use of symptom assessment apps 25 ; however, it is known that lay-people are less reliable at entering clinical vignettes than healthcare providers. 26 A further strength of this study is that each decision of whether a condition suggestion (from an app or a GP) matched the clinical-vignette's main and other differential diagnoses was made in a rigorous manner following the 3-physician tie-breaker panel approach of Semigran et al. 6 A limitation of this study was that a systematic and comprehensive process was not used to select the symptom assessment apps to be included. Practical considerations in study design necessitated that the study evaluated a total of eight apps, due to the large number of vignettes assessed. The aim of the selection process was to include only apps with similar intended use, and to include those most used, those still in current use which have been evaluated in other studies, those most used within the UK as the study used vignettes based on UK patient data and those most used in the USA, as it is a highly important market for symptom assessment applications. Apps were then selected using a hybrid approach, including, based on the knowledge of available apps of the study team, internet searching and industry sources on usage data of symptom assessment apps. For apps identified using this approach, rigorous exclusion criteria were applied: all apps which did not provide, for a general population, primary care condition suggestions and urgency advice, were excluded. Through the application of this methodology, we have assured that all included apps were appropriate and relevant for inclusion, but it is possible, due to the limiting of the study to eight apps, without a rigorous prioritisation selection procedure, that there was unintentional bias in app inclusion. Nonetheless, the study included all the highest used symptom assessment apps in the UK and the USA, at the time of app selection, based on app usage statistics for the Google Play and Apple iOS app stores. The non-systematic selection criteria used were that, at the time of selection: (1) Babylon and Ada are leading symptom assessment smartphone apps in the UK; (2) K Health, WebMD and Ada are the most used in USA (usage data from Sensely, https://www. sensely. com);",

Ada employees were involved in the vignette creation process, and although it was ensured that the vignette creation was separated from app medical intelligence development, unintentional bias could have resulted in vignette wording that was more accessible to symptom assessment apps than the average real word primary care clinical presentation is. A data acquisition error by one of the app-entry-Drs meant there were unrecorded urgency advice data for 12.0% of vignettes for one app (K Health) and incomplete source data verification screenshots for two other apps (Your.MD and WebMD).

For a total of 622 cases, Mediktor's M1 score was reported as 42.9%, M3 score as 75.4% (ie, the symptom assessment app's top-1 (M1), top-3 (M3), or top-10 condition-suggestion(s) matched the discharge diagnosis in this percentage of cases). When Moreno Barriga et al 7 reported results are refactored to consider all patient discharge diagnoses (the standard approach) the: M1 is 34.0% and M3 is 63.0%, compared with M1 of 23.5% and M3 of 36.0% for Mediktor in this study (all-vignettes data). The reason for lower Mediktor performance in the current study compared with the study in Moreno Barriga et al 7 is not known but it may be related to a different range of conditions or difficulty level than the non-urgent emergency cases presenting to the ED-for example-the vignettes in this study contain many true emergency cases and also many GP or pharmacy/treat-at-home cases which would not be represented by the ED patients included in Moreno Barriga et al 7 . In 2017, a 42-vignette evaluation of WebMD 28 determined its accuracy for ophthalmic condition suggestion: M1 was 26.0% and M3 was 38.0%. Urgency advice based on the top diagnosis was appropriate in 39.0% of emergency cases and 88.0% of nonemergency cases.",

There are large (and statistically significant) differences between app coverage, suggested condition accuracy and urgency-advice accuracy. One of the biggest challenges in comparing symptom checker apps are the differences in coverage. Some coverage restrictions, such as not allowing symptom assessment for one user subgroup (eg, children), have no negative effect on the app's effective use for other user subgroups (eg, adults). Other situations, such as the inability to search for certain symptoms, providing no conditionsuggestions/urgency advice for certain input symptoms, or, excluding comorbidities, mental health or pregnancy are more problematic and can raise concerns about the safety and benefits of the app for users who might be in those groups.",

While it has been argued that the accuracy of urgency advice may be the most important output from a health assessment app, the condition suggestions may be valuable to support patient decision-making. 27 To address the effect of patients entering data directly into an app about their own acute conditions, an observational investigation is currently underway in an acute clinical setting in the USA by investigators including coauthors of this study.
