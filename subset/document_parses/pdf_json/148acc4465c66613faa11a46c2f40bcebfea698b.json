Across both groups, median age was 17\u00b76 years (IQR 16\u00b74-18\u00b75), 16 277 (57\u00b76%) of 28 270 responders were female, and 11 993 (42\u00b74%) were male. Participants in the case group had greater odds of having at least one long COVID symptom lasting at least 2 months compared with the control group (3159 [61\u00b79%] vs 12 340 [57\u00b70%], odds ratio 1\u00b722 [95% CI 1\u00b715-1\u00b730]; p<0\u00b70001).

Participants in the case group had better quality of life scores on the PedsQL than in the control group: physical functioning mean score 88\u00b77 (SD 13\u00b79, median 93\u00b78 [IQR 84\u00b74-100\u00b70]) versus 86\u00b75 (14\u00b73, 90\u00b76 [81\u00b73-96\u00b79]; p<0\u00b70001); emotional functioning 77\u00b71 (20\u00b73, 80\u00b70 [65\u00b70-95\u00b70]) versus 71\u00b77 (21\u00b74, 75\u00b70 [60\u00b70-90\u00b70]; p<0\u00b70001); social functioning 93\u00b71 (12\u00b75, 100\u00b70 [90\u00b70-100\u00b70]) versus 88\u00b74 (16\u00b72, 95\u00b70 [80\u00b70-100\u00b70]; p<0\u00b70001); and school functioning 66\u00b79 (22\u00b75, 65\u00b70 [60\u00b70-85\u00b70]) versus 62\u00b79 (22\u00b71, 65\u00b70 [50\u00b70-80\u00b70]; p<0\u00b70001). More participants in the case group than in the control group reported 16 or more sick days (1205 [18\u00b72%] vs 2518 [11\u00b76%]; p<0\u00b70001) and 16 or more days of school absence (695 [10\u00b75%] vs 1777 [8\u00b72%]; p<0\u00b70001). Interpretation Participants with SARS-CoV-2-positive tests had more long-lasting symptoms and sick leave, whereas participants in the control group had more short-lasting symptoms and worse quality of life.

Several studies have investigated symptoms of long COVID among adults, [6] [7] [8] [9] but only a few studies have addressed long COVID in children and adolescents. A recent review identified 14 such studies, 10 but only five of these included a control group, with a total of only 5270 cases and 12 588 controls. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Of these five studies, three found that persistent SARS-CoV-2-related symptoms were more prevalent in children and adolescents following SARS-CoV-2 infection (cases) compared with controls, [13] [14] [15] and two studies found no differences between cases and controls. 11, 12 The longest follow-up time was 12 weeks, and two studies did not have laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2. 16 , 17 Long-term symptoms after a viral infection are a known phenomenon in children and adolescentseg, persistent coughing after a respiratory syncytial virus infection in infants and toddlers, 18 and persistent fatigue, headaches, and abdominal pain after Epstein-Barr virus infection. 19 Thus, long COVID in adolescents would not be unexpected.",

The objectives were to explore (1) the prevalence of symptoms lasting more than 2 months; (2) the duration and intensity of symptoms; (3) quality of life; and (4) psychological and social outcomes in adolescents testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 compared with matched controls who never had a SARS-CoV-2-positive test.

CSSI-24=Children's Somatic Symptoms Inventory-24. PedsQL=Pediatric Quality of Life. were in the 23-27% range, which is slightly less than for other, non-COVID-19 studies including adolescents in general, 30 ,31 yet much higher than in recent studies investigating COVID-19 symptoms in adolescents (less than 14%). 10, 13, 15 Non-response bias might be present because more non-responders were male than female. Sampling bias is unlikely due to similar response rates between the two groups. Participants in the case group and the control group were not sent the same questionnaire because participants in the case group were asked to report on acute symptoms and if symptoms were perceived to be new and related to COVID-19. Furthermore, those in the case group were asked to report on comorbidities before their SARS-CoV-2-positive test and those in the control group were asked to report on previous comorbidity with no index date. This difference caused some systemic response error. The retrospective recall up to 12 months might have caused recall bias. Most data are subjective; however, that is the nature of symptoms such as headache, anxiety, and fatigue. The case-only reporting is important to investigate new symptoms not known before the SARS-CoV-2-positive test; however, data should be interpreted with caution due to the absence of meaningful controls. Overall, participants in the case group had fewer pre-existing comorbidities than in the control group. In general, participants in the case group had a higher number of symptoms lasting a long time than in the control group-eg chest pain, trouble breathing, cough, headaches, sore throat, and dizziness. These could be long-lasting symptoms of COVID-19. Three 13, 14, 15 of five previous studies of long COVID in adolescents that included a control group found a difference in persistent symptoms, with more symptoms in the case group, whereas two studies 11, 12 reported no difference between the groups. The studies reporting no difference in persistent symptoms had shorter follow-up times of 1\u00b75 to 3 months, had smaller sample sizes, and included different symptoms (eg, sleep disturbance and myalgia or arthralgia) and methods than the studies that did report a difference between the groups. Surprisingly, in our study, compared with the case group, participants in the control group generally reported worse outcomes in the validated generic questionnaires for symptoms, psychological outcomes, and quality of life with 2-4 weeks recall time. However, the differences might not be clinically relevant even though they were statistically significant as only for emotional and social outcomes were small, clinically significant effect sizes found. In the control group, we also found more reporting of rashes, mood swings, dark circles under the eyes, and chapped lips, compared with the case group. One possible explanation of the difference in these symptoms might be the demographic and clinical profiles at baseline, with more comorbidity among the control group. It could also be that the control group had greater fear of COVID-19 and more restricted everyday life due to protecting themselves from the virus. Also, our validated questionnaires have 2-4 weeks recall, meaning that many participants in the case group went a long time since infection and could be free of symptoms.",

Furthermore, the symptoms are common ailments that many people have every year. Thus, potential differences between the groups in intensity and duration of these symptoms might have been masked. Denmark is one of the countries testing the most, with a mean of almost ten PCR tests per person from the beginning of the pandemic up to when the survey was administered, and as many antigen tests. However, some adolescents might have had undetected, asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection and, therefore, the reported mean differences in symptoms between our case and control groups could be greater than those experienced by the average individual contracting a SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

The most prevalent symptoms in our study were headache, loss of appetite, and fatigue. Previous literature has verified these findings with varying prevalence; 10 however, difficulty breathing was not reported previously. The number and severity of symptoms decreased over time, which was also detected previously; however, this study provides more robust evidence of this decrease.
