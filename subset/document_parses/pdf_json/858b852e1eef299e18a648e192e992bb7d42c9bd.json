Researchers have long considered excessive impulsivity to be a core feature of schizophrenia and psychotic disorders. For example, several studies utilizing self-report measures have found that individuals with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders were more impulsive than healthy controls [2, 3] . Moreover, Iancu et al. revealed that the general psychopathology and positive symptoms of schizophrenia were positively correlated with impulsivity [4] . Neurocognitive studies have also demonstrated impairments in frontal/executive brain regions associated with inhibitory and response inhibition processes related to impulsivity amongst these patients [2, 5] . Similarly, behavioural studies revealed that patients with schizophrenia perform poorly on impulsivity measures such as the stop-signal task [6, 7] or delay discounting measures [8] .",

Studies indicate that individuals with higher impulsivity are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviour because they lack the self-control to refrain from doing so [12] . Among those with schizophrenia, higher impulsivity has been associated with increased risk of violent, aggressive, and/or antisocial behaviours [13, 14] . Individuals with schizophrenia who had lifetime alcohol abuse/ dependence were found to have higher impulsivity and sensation-seeking than those without comorbid alcohol abuse/dependence [15] . In addition, schizophrenia has also been associated with an increased risk of violent behaviors compared to other psychiatric illnesses [16, 17] and the general population [18] . Given how impulsivity is associated with risky or harmful behaviours, this construct is particularly important to mental health researchers. Understanding the relationship between impulsivity and high-risk behaviours may allow for the adaptation or development of preventive or therapeutic strategies to ameliorate the quality of life for individuals with schizophrenia and reduce risk-taking behaviours.",

One widely used measure is the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS-11) [19] . A study by Zhornitsky et al. found that impulsivity was significantly higher in patients with schizophrenia, substance use disorder, and those with a dual diagnosis compared to healthy controls using the BIS -11 [20] . Another study conducted by Nolan et al. similarly found that patients with schizophrenia scored higher on impulsivity than healthy controls [7] . However, psychometric studies have suggested that the original factor structure of the BIS-11 may not be valid and have proposed alternatives [21] [22] [23] . A systematic review by Vasconcelos et al. suggested that the number and content of factors of the BIS-11 are unstable and recommended that researchers explore the items rather than apply the original model [24] . Within Singapore, a multi-ethnic nation-state in Southeast Asia, the BIS-11 has been used in adolescent [25, 26] and pathological gambling [27] samples. However, to date, no studies have utilized a validated measure of impulsivity in Singapore. Therefore, the study aims were twofold: i) to validate the factor structure of the BIS-11 within a sample of outpatients with schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, and ii) to examine sociodemographic and clinical correlates, (i.e., problematic alcohol use, hazardous drug use, and symptom severity) of impulsivity.",

Within a sample of undergraduates, psychiatric patients, and inmates, Patton et al. suggested that the BIS-11 comprised six first-order factors of attention, motor impulsiveness, self-control, cognitive complexity, perseverance, and cognitive instability [19] . These fell under three second-order factors: attentional, motor, and non-planning impulsiveness. Examples of items from the scale (each of the subscales) are-'I make up my mind quickly' (motor impulsiveness), 'I often have extraneous thoughts when thinking (attentional impulsiveness), and 'I say things without thinking' (non-planning impulsiveness). The BIS-11 has shown good internal consistency in various populations, with Cronbach's alpha ranging from 0.69 to 0.83 [24, 31] .",

However, upon examination of each rotated solution, 14 items were removed due to cross-loadings and/or loadings < 0.30. Eigenvalues for the remaining 16 items indicated that one to four factors solutions were viable. A three-factor solution was found to be optimal. Subsequently, this solution was applied in the second subsample via CFA, with results indicating acceptable fit of the model to the observed data (WLSMV \u03c7 2 (101) = 161.26, RMSEA = 0.06, CFI = 0.97, TLI = 0.96, SRMR = 0.07). Standardized factor loadings of the final three-factor solution can be found in Table 3 . No modification indices were specified. Standardized factor loadings of the items to their respective factors ranged from 0.43 to 0.86. The three factors were named: i) Non-planning impulsivity (5-items), ii) Motor impulsiveness (6-items), and iii) Lack of self-control (5-items). Internal consistency assessed by Cronbach alpha values were high, at 0.94, 0.84 and 0.85, respectively. To calculate each factor score, items corresponding to their respective factors were summed. However, the scores on the items belonging to the Non-planning factor were reversed before summation as they were positively worded. Therefore, higher scores on all factors indicate higher impulsivity.",

The results of our study indicate that instead of the original 30-item version, an abbreviated 16-item version of BIS-11 comprising three factors shows better psychometric properties in the Singapore patient sample. Few studies have validated the original factor structure of BIS-11 [51, 52] . The differences may be due to the patient population, as few studies have validated the factor structure among patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. The three factors identified in our study, non-planning impulsivity, motor impulsiveness, and lack of self-control, reflect the findings in other studies that show that the factor of \"non-planning impulsiveness\" tends to be the most stable factor, whereas \"attentional impulsiveness\" is unstable with the items loading on other factors [24] . It is also plausible that cultural and linguistic interpretations of the items of the BIS-11 may have affected its factor structure. For example, the item \"I change residences\" may not be applicable in Singapore, which according to the commercial real estate service and investment firm CBRE Group, has the 2 nd most expensive housing market in the world [53] , thus leading to fairly stable living arrangements.",

Post-hoc pairwise comparisons indicated that the married group did not significantly differ from the single or the divorced/separated/widowed group.

Similarly, in a sample of adults aged 18 to 45 years, Herman et al. found that age was negatively correlated with behavioural measures of impulsivity [66] . Furthermore, other studies of adolescence to early adulthood report negative correlations between chronological age and impulsivity [67, 68] . However, we acknowledge that the items measuring impulsivity may not have the same meaning among those belonging to the older age group compared to younger age groups. While the BIS-11 items are generally neutral statements, for example, 'I get easily bored when solving thought problems' , 'I act on the spur of the moment' which should carry the same meanings across different age groups; regardless, some statements could have an age-sensitive interpretation., For example, responses are likely to be confounded by health or physical restrictions that come with aging. A recent study by Tsatali et al. found that both factor structure and factor loadings of the BIS differed across younger and older adult populations [69] . The authors suggested that these differences could be due to differences in the construct of impulsivity due to changes in personality across the lifespan.",

This may be due to two reasons. First, Singapore adopts strict measures towards drug use, with penalties for controlled drugs ranging from hefty fines to corporal and/or capital punishment [72] . As such, drug use in this sample may have been underreported for fear of these consequences, even though participants were assured that their responses were anonymous and confidential. Second, there is a lack of access to drugs within Singapore due to rigorous drug enforcement. It is possible that individuals with high impulsivity might want to use drugs but were unable to do so due to the strict enforcement in place.",

Similarly, a recent study within the Hungarian population demonstrated that higher psychological symptoms were correlated with higher impulsivity [36] . Moreover, studies among patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders also suggest that impulsivity is related to general psychopathology, positive and/or negative symptoms [4, 8, 13] . Several mechanisms have been postulated to explain this association. These include the association of severe positive symptoms with disturbances in inhibitory control functions [35, 73] and white matter tracts in the right prefrontal cortex and the right frontal pole that may underlie both dysfunctional impulse control and symptom severity [74] .",

Firstly, as the present study is of a cross-sectional nature, it is limited in its ability to identify causal relationships. Secondly, since participants were recruited via convenience sampling, selection bias may have affected the results. We acknowledge that the majority of the sample was young, single, and of Chinese ethnicity. However, the Chinese are the largest ethnic group in Singapore, comprising threefourths of the population [75] , which is also reflected in our patient population. Patients with schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders seen in the clinical settings are generally single and belong to the younger age groups, as seen in several studies which have been conducted in the same population [76, 77] . Thus, the participants were largely representative of the clinical population. However, it is possible that the sample consisted of individuals who were less symptomatic or had less severe symptoms. Given the requirements of the informed consent and selfreport, those with severe impairment were unable to participate in this study. This could have affected the results limiting the generalizability of the findings. Thirdly, the data collection period overlapped with the COVID-19 pandemic, and patients may have been more anxious and isolated, thus manifesting a lower level of functioning during this pandemic. This might have influenced participation and further increased the risk of selection bias. Fourthly, the study did not recruit those above 65 years, and the proportion of patients in the 50 -64 age group was relatively smaller. Lastly, it would have been prudent to compare this sample with healthy controls for a more complete picture. Given some of the limitations associated with the sampling, our study may not sufficiently represent the population of those experiencing psychotic disorders.",

First, psychometric properties such as convergent and divergent validity or measurement invariance of the model should be assessed. Second, future studies should examine how different levels of impulsivity are related to actual risk-taking behaviours. For example, researchers could examine the impulsivity levels and forensic profiles (e.g., drug use, violent behaviour) amongst outpatients, inpatients who engage in risky or violent behaviour prior to admission, or those who engage in these behaviours while admitted. Third, future studies examining impulsivity and its correlates can also employ latent class analyses to identify subclasses that may be more prone to risky behaviour. Identifying such groups would provide further understanding and opportunities to modify risk factors.",

Future studies should examine its underlying factor structure before conducting any subsequent analyses. Results of EFA and CFA indicated a three-factor solution with 16-items: non-planning impulsivity, motor impulsiveness, and lack of self-control. Age, ethnicity, marital status, education, problematic alcohol use, and general psychiatric symptom severity were found to be correlates of impulsivity. These groups may be at-risk for real-world risky or dangerous behaviours, and future studies should examine this relationship in further detail. Mental health services should employ interventions to help these individuals manage their impulsivity.",
