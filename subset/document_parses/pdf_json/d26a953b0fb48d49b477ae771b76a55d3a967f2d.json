We used the time and season of death of 932 individuals from GTEx to jointly investigate transcriptomic changes associated with those cycles across multiple tissues. Overall, most variation across tissues during day-night and among seasons was unique to each cycle. Although all tissues remodeled their transcriptomes, brain and gonadal tissues exhibited the highest seasonality, whereas those in the thoracic cavity showed stronger day-night regulation. Core clock genes displayed marked day-night differences across multiple tissues, which were largely conserved in baboon and mouse, but adapted to their nocturnal or diurnal habits. Seasonal variation of expression affected multiple pathways and it was enriched among genes associated with the immune response, consistent with the seasonality of viral infections. Furthermore, they unveiled cytoarchitectural changes in brain regions.",

            "text": "The yearly and daily movement of the earth around the sun and around itself has created a continuously changing environment since the origin of life to which all organisms across the phylogenetic spectrum have adapted. In mammals, in particular, behavioral adaptations to daily rhythm include the regulation of sleep and feeding cycles. Recent studies have investigated how the physiological responses to the daily cycle are reflected at the transcriptomic level. These studies have reported large-scale circadian gene expression oscillations in mice (Zhang et al. 2014 ), baboons (Mure et al. 2018) , and humans (Ruben et al. 2018; Anafi et al. 2017) . Unlike the circadian process, circannual rhythm in mammals has been less studied. Animals exhibit a range of behavioral and physiological adaptations in different seasons, such as hibernation and alterations of the coat color in polar animals (Drew et al. 2007; Ferreira et al. 2017) . One way in which mammals regulate their seasonal reproductive behavior, growth, food intake, and migratory behavior is via the brain-gonadal and other hormonal axes (Hanon et al. 2008; Dardente et al. 2014; Lomet et al. 2018) . In humans, numerous pathologies present a strong seasonal pattern, which is particularly prominent for many infectious diseases, but also observed in complex cardiovascular and psychiatric disorders (Watson et al. 1984; Philpot et al. 1989; Torrey et al. 2000; Owens and McGorry 2003; Xu et al. 2013; Li et al. 2017a; Sharon et al. 2019) . Nevertheless, despite its relevance for human physiology and disease, genome-wide studies on circannual rhythms are scarce. Castro Dopico et al. (2015) analyzed the transcriptome of white blood cells from children in Germany, from individuals affected with type 1 diabetes from the UK, and from asthmatic cohorts from distinct geographical locations (Dopico et al. 2015) . They found many genes with seasonal expression profiles, inverted between Europe and Oceania. These seasonal expression profiles were prominent in genes from the immune system. To our knowledge, however, there are no genomewide studies of the transcriptional impact of these adaptations to seasonal variation across multiple human tissues.",

(Ruberto et al. 2021 ) and Mishra et al. (Mishra et al. 2021) ). While MetaCycle uses three methods to identify oscillating genes, only Lomb-Scargle is suited for GTEx data, due to the uneven distribution of the time of death. Using this method, from the 18,018 protein-coding genes expressed in at least one tissue (median TPM \u2265 1), we identified 187 (1%) that were circadian in at least one tissue (non-adjusted P \u2264 0.05; Table S1 ). This number is much smaller than that previously reported in baboon (Mure et al. 2018) , where 82% of the protein-coding genes had circadian patterns in at least one of the 64 studied tissues. Lack of power to detect genes with circadian gene expression patterns can be partially attributed to the characteristics of the GTEx resource. As reported, the GTEx metadata only includes the time of the day and the season of death, and there is no information about the location of death. Therefore, we focused only on the individuals in which the time of death could be unequivocally classified as either day [8:00-17:00) (351 individuals) or night [21:00-5:00) (315 individuals), and excluded those in which death occurred outside these intervals (the twilight zone; 222 individuals) (Fig. 1A) . We then identified genes that were differentially expressed between day and night.",

We performed an initial comparison across tissues with high sensitivity, applying loose cut-offs of a non-adjusted P \u2264 0.05 and an absolute log2 fold-change \u2265 0.1. From the 18,022 protein-coding genes expressed in at least one tissue (median TPM \u2265 1), we found that 12,530 (70%) were differentially expressed between day and night in at least one of the 46 tested tissues (day-night genes, Supplementary Dataset 1), which is a number in line with the results found in baboon. However, it should be noted that, while this approach increases the power to detect significant changes in gene expression, it does not necessarily lead to the identification of all genes with circadian patterns of gene expression, since the circadian peaks may occur at the twilight time zones that we are ignoring.

Other tissues with proportionally low number of day-night genes were colon transverse (92, 0.67%) and testis (105, 0.66%). Brain regions also showed a relatively small number of day-night changes (ranging from 0.86% to 7.8%; Fig. 2A ). Caudate was the brain region with the highest number of day-night genes (1,026 7.8%), followed by the cerebellum (766, 5.7%), which was reported to have a sleep stage-dependent activity (Canto et al. 2017) . Some tissues showed a bias in the number of genes overexpressed during the day (diurnal genes) versus the night (nocturnal genes) ( Fig. 2A and Table S3 ). Stomach was the tissue with the strongest diurnal preference, while non-sun exposed skin was the tissue with the strongest nocturnal preference. In contrast, sun exposed skin showed diurnal preference (0.7 log2 day/night genes ratio), suggesting that UV plays a role in the activation of gene expression.",

This is in agreement with the hypothesis that one molecular clock program is present in all tissues but the circadian processes triggered downstream are highly tissue-specific (Scheiermann et al. 2013) . Core clock genes usually have effect sizes (difference between day and night expression) that are larger than those of non-core clock day-night genes ( Fig. S1 ). ARNTL, a positive regulator of the core clock, was the gene with a day-night pattern in the largest number of tissues (33 tissues; Fig. 2B ). Its expression at the time of death, aggregated across the GTEx donors, nicely captures the known circadian behaviour of this gene ( Fig. 2C) , strongly indicating that, in spite of all the caveats associated with the data collection and available metadata, the GTEx data can be effectively used to investigate gene expression patterns during the day-night cycle. A recent study described ARNTL as the main regulator of the inter-tissue timekeeping function in mouse (Welz et al. 2019) , and our results suggest that it may play a similar role in humans. Similarly, NPAS2 was the second gene with a day-night pattern in the largest number of tissues (31 tissues; Fig. 2B ,D) and has also been reported as being circadian in many mouse (Li et al. 2018 ) and baboon (Mure et al. 2018) tissues.",

We defined these genes as \"high-confidence day-night genes\" (Fig. 2B ). High-confidence day-night genes included most clock genes (with the exception of TIMELESS, RORA and RORB) and were significantly enriched for circadian and photoperiodism related Gene Ontology (GO) terms ( Fig. 3D and Table S9 ). Moreover, this gene set significantly overlapped those annotated as circadian in the Circadian Gene DataBase in humans (Li et al. 2017b ) (87 genes, P = 3.074 \u00d7 10 -8 one-sided Fisher test), and substantially expands the set of genes known to be varying during the day-night cycle. Additional GO terms were enriched among high-confidence day-night genes, including apoptosis and cell cycle regulation (genes peaking during the day) or fatty acid metabolism, cellular respiration and various signalling pathways (genes peaking during the night)( Fig. 3D and Table S9 ). An example of high-confidence day-night gene with previously unknown circadian variation is THRA (Fig. S4A) , a thyroid hormone receptor that peaks at night in 15 tissues (including the thyroid), the expression of which was found disrupted in the hypothalamic structures of rats in constant darkness or lighting (Klimina et al. 2019) . Other examples of high-confidence daynight genes present in a large number of tissues are the ribosomal protein RPS26 (day in 16 tissues), the nuclear pore complex protein NPIPB5 (day in 16 tissues), and the transcription corepressor TRIM22 (day in 13 tissues) ( Fig. S4B-D) .",

Therefore, as per day-night variation, we defined sets of highconfidence seasonal genes that varied in a consistent manner across multiple tissues for each season separately (Table S13; Table S13 ). The top enriched gene functions were largely specific for individual seasons, although some regulatory categories such as transcription and translation were shared by multiple sets (Fig. 5B and Table S14 ).

Similarly, RTF1, a component of the RNA polymerase II transcription-associated PAF1 complex, decreased in fall in nine tissues ( Fig. S9A ). This complex is deeply conserved across eukaryotes, and it has been described to be involved in the regulation of flowering time in plants (Ko et al. 2011; Dorcey et al. 2012) and to be required for induction of heat shock genes in animals (Tenney et al. 2006; Alpsoy and Dykhuizen 2018) . PAF1c has been proposed to establish an antiviral state to prevent infection by incoming retroviruses: in case of infection by influenza A strain H3N2, PAF1c associates with viral NS1 protein, thereby regulating gene transcription (Liu et al. 2011) . Other examples include C4A, decreasing in spring in 21 tissues (Fig. S9B) , which localizes to the histocompatibility complex, and KRT1, which decreases in 24 tissues in winter (Fig. S9C) , and encodes a keratin gene that is a downstream effector of the corticotropin hormone release pathway (Slenter et al. 2018) . Krt1 mutations in mouse have been associated with various phenotypic defects, ranging from abnormal circulating interleukin (Roth et al. 2012) to aberrant pigmentation of the epidermis (McGowan et al. 2006) . Seasonal pigment variation is well known in mammals from the northern hemisphere (Zimova et al. 2018) , which might suggest a conserved role of the corticotropin release pathway in pigment seasonal variation.",

These were usually highly tissue specific, since only seven of these genes belonged to the set of 1,370 genes with recurrent seasonal patterns. These genes were enriched for functions related to epidermal differentiation and immunity (Fig. 5C) , consistent with previous results in blood cells (Dopico et al. 2015) . In line with the enrichment for multiple immune-related functions, these genes also exhibited significant overlap with gene sets that have been associated with COVID-19, including genes whose expression changes upon SARS-CoV-2 infection and genes predicted to be functionally related to ACE2 (Fig. S12) , although ACE2 itself did not show a strong seasonal pattern. In particular, 24 out of the top 200 genes among the latter predictions (12.5%) were strongly seasonal, with 20 of them being up-regulated in the intestine specifically in the winter.",

Thus, to explore whether genes that encode peptide hormones undergo particularly strong seasonal changes, we used a list of 62 genes with hormone-encoding capability based on Mirabeau et al. (Mirabeau et al. 2007 ) (Methods , Table S15 ). Overall, we found 39 (63%) hormone genes to be seasonal in at least one tissue (Fig. S10) , a significant depletion respect to the whole genome (P = 7.011 \u00d7 10 -14 , two-sided proportion test). However, five hormone genes were included in at least one high-confidence seasonal gene set (Fig. 5D ). Among these, POMC, a well-known photoperiodic hormone, was seasonal in 26 tissue-season pairs, mainly in summer. POMC expression has been shown to be dependent on longer-term photoperiod in the Siberian hamsters (Bao et al. 2019) . Other seasonal hormones also have well known roles, mainly in the cardiovascular system and growth: UCN, a corticotropin for stress response and appetite regulation (Cullen et al. 2001; Vandael and Gounko 2019) and ADM, which is important for vasodilation (Geven et al. 2018) . GNRH1, the gonadotropin-releasing hormone 1, which influences seasonal changes in other mammals (Hart et al. 1984) , is seasonal in two artery tissues: the aorta and the tibial one. Mutations in GNRH1 have been shown to be related to ischemic heart disease, which shows a seasonal pattern (Bhatia et al. 2017; Schooling and Ng 2019) . Interestingly, leptin (LEP), a hormone involved in seasonal food-seeking behaviour, thermoregulation (Fischer et al. 2020) , and obesity (Srivastava and Krishna 2007; Cahill et al. 2013) , was altered only in winter in three tissues: adipose visceral, nerve, and blood (Fig. S10) .",

Oligodendrocyte markers, in contrast, tended to decrease expression in the fall, in particular in nucleus accumbens and anterior cingulate cortex (Fig. 6) .

Here, in contrast, we use the actual time of death reported in the GTEx metadata. Even though GTEx captures a single snapshot of the tissue transcriptomes of the donors at the time of death, since this time is approximately uniformly distributed throughout the day and the year, the aggregation of the data snapshots across individuals produces trajectories that allowed us to investigate temporal variations in gene expression. Moreover, although there is an impact of the death of the individual in the transcriptome, which is tissue-specific, this can be properly controlled for ).",

We have addressed this limitation by discretizing the continuous circadian variation into day versus night, and the circannual variation into seasons. This impacts the way in which we specifically formulate the questions, i.e. we do not refer to the variations reported here as circadian and circannual, but as day-night and seasonal, respectively, and restricts the statistical methods that can be employed to analyze the data. Thus, while ANOVA would appear the natural approach to identify seasonal changes in gene expression, the large variation in the date of death within each season decreases in practice the power to detect significant changes in gene expression; therefore, we opted for focusing on a method that allows leveraging the unknown date of death and that could be more directly compared with that employed for the day-night analyses (i.e. performing pairwise differential gene expression analyses). Despite these and other caveats (e.g. effect of artificial lights, ethnic origins, date of the RNA extractions, etc.), our approach was able to properly capture at least part of the real circadian and circannual transcriptional variation, since we have been able to recapitulate previous findings regarding day-night variation.",

            "text": "We performed an initial comparison of both types of variation within and among tissues using relaxed cut-offs, finding that the effect of day-night variation in gene expression was comparable to that of the seasonal cycle, but affecting different genes and tissues. Remarkably, day-night variation in gene expression was more prominent in liver, lung, heart, and upper digestive tract, reflecting the involvement of the organs of the thoracic cavity in circadian processes (Nosal et al. 2020 ), while seasonal variation had the strongest effect in brain subregions and testis, mirroring the role of the brain-gonadal hormonal axis in regulating the physiological responses to seasonal variation (Kang et al. 2020) . Moreover, we showed that the effect of day-night and/or seasonal variation for most genes was highly tissue-specific. In the case of the day-night genes, this is in agreement with the hypothesis that one molecular clock program is present in all tissues, but the circadian processes triggered downstream are highly tissue-specific (Scheiermann et al. 2013 ). However, subsets of genes showed highly consistent up-or down-regulation during day or night or in specific seasons across multiple tissues, which we defined as high-confidence day-night or seasonal genes, respectively. Importantly, the day-night high-confidence set was highly enriched for genes with a known circadian pattern and included most known core clock genes. In addition, various metabolic functions were enriched among day or night genes, in line with multiple reports (e.g. (Neufeld-Cohen et al. 2016; Hatori et al. 2012) ). The direction of the change in gene expression for the core clock genes and other high-confidence day-night genes was highly consistent among tissues, but we found two cases in which changes in gene expression occurred unexpectedly in opposite directions between brain and non-brain tissues. This is the case of NR1D2 and RGS1, in which the day-night changes in gene expression occurred in the opposite direction in the brain than in tissues from the rest of the body. This suggests that the cellular environment could modulate the interpretation of the core clock signals, and produce different (or even opposite) outputs in different tissues in response to the same environmental cues.",

Similarly, NPAS2 was detected as cycling in 23 baboon tissues compared to eight tissues for CLOCK (Mure et al. 2018) .

This is reflected in the tissue-specific seasonal variation in gene expression that we have uncovered, which affects prominently testis and many brain regions. When investigating specifically the expression patterns of genes involved in functions related to the hormonal axis, we found these to be predominantly seasonal in core tissues from the endocrine system, such as hypothalamus and pituitary.

In particular, these included genes that change expression in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and genes predicted to be functionally related to ACE2, an endogenous membrane protein that mediates SARS-CoV-2 infection.

Genes were filtered per tissue, removing all genes with a median TPM < 1 over the day and night samples, leading to 18,022 protein-coding genes expressed in at least one tissue (31,530 genes including all biotypes). The analyses were run using R v3.6.1 (Team 2019), the TMM normalisation method from edgeR (with the calcNormFactors function) (Robinson et al. 2010; McCarthy et al. 2012) , and the voom-limma pipeline (with the voom, lmFit, and eBayes functions) (Law et al. 2014; Ritchie et al. 2015) using default parameters. The significance of the time of death was assessed correcting for the following covariates: sex if the tissue was not sex-specific; age; body mass index (BMI); the postmortem interval; the season of death. All genes with an associate P \u2264 0.05 and an absolute log2 fold-change \u2265 0.1 were considered as day-night. Results, including all biotypes, are available in Supplementary Dataset 1 (including p-values, adjusted p-values and log2 foldchanges). The number of differentially expressed genes across experiments was not affected by the number of samples (Fig. S13A ) and no effect was observed regarding the ratio of day/night samples and the number of differentially expressed genes between day and night (Fig. S13B) .",

This resulted in a set of 18,018 protein-coding genes expressed in at least one tissue (31,517 genes including all biotypes). The effect of each season was assessed by comparing one season against all the others, leading to four differential expression analyses, one for each season (see 'Differential expression between day and night' for details). This approach was taken to make the analyses more consistent with that of daynight variation (i.e. using the exact same method), and to minimize the impact of the fact that only the season, but not the actual day, of death is known in GTEx (i.e. two individuals could have died one day apart but in two different seasons, or 90 days apart but still within the same season). The covariates used were the following: time of death classified as: day, night or twilight; sex if the tissue was not sex-specific; age; BMI; postmortem interval.

We assessed the significance of the number of up-or down-regulated markers for each cell type in each specific region-season pair (each cell in Fig. 6 ) as well as for all regions together (top row in Fig. 6 ). For this purpose, we first counted the total number of instances in which markers for a given cell type are up and down-regulated across the entire set of region-season pairs (Astrocyte: 42 up, 36 down; Endothelial: 12 up, 20 down, Microglia, 9 up, 8 down; Neuron, 27 up, 12 down; Oligodendrocytes, 18 up, 27 down) . Then, we performed 1,000,000 randomizations of the up and down instances across seasons and regions. We conservatively allowed only up or down markers in a given region-season pair for each cell type, since this is what we have observed in the real data (i.e. no cell type markers showed contradictory patterns in any region-season pair). To calculate the p-value for each region-season pair we simply obtained the number of randomizations in which the number of up-or down-regulated markers was equal or higher than the tested region-season pair and divided it by one million. These pvalues were Bonferroni corrected for multiple testing (260 tests). To calculate the p-value across regions, we sum all up and down instances across regions, and again obtained the number of randomizations in which the number of up-or down-regulated markers was equal or higher than the sum across regions and divided it by one million. These p-values were also Bonferroni corrected for multiple testing (20 tests).",

All significant markers for a cell type for a specific season in a subregion were differentially expressed in the same direction, over or under expressed. Markers without significant effects were colored in grey. P-values were obtained by randomizing the observed number of up-and down-regulated markers per cell type across regions and seasons conservatively allowing only up-or down-regulated makers for a given region-season combination (see Methods for details).",

Gene names for core clock genes are shown next to the dot with the corresponding number of tissues in which they are identified as day-night. Black diamonds show the number",

In addition, we labelled each gene (\"Main gene time\") as day (night) if it was up-regulated Distribution of the seasonal genes in the GTEx tissues. (A) Number of unique genes found as seasonal (x-axis), i.e. genes differentially expressed in at least one season when compared to the others, per tissue (y-axis). The numbers in parentheses represent the percentage of unique seasonal genes in a given tissue over the number of expressed genes in that tissue. (B) Number of unique seasonal vs. day-night genes per tissue. Statistics from a Spearman's correlation are shown. Tissue colors correspond to the GTEx color panel. (C) log2 ratio between the number of day-night genes vs seasonal genes for each tissue and season separately. The higher the log2 value, the more day-night genes compare to the number of seasonal genes.",
