According to a report published by the Pew Research Center, 72% of adults in the US have searched for at least one type of health information on the Internet [7] . Because of its convenience, the Internet meets the public's demands for having face-to-face consultations with professional medical and nursing personnel [8] . Nonetheless, it is also responsible for the prevalence of health misinformation [9] , because traditional qualitycontrol mechanisms, such as professional editors, are excluded from the informationgeneration process. Particularly, the development of Web 2.0 has changed Internet users from passive information consumers to users who actively generate content on websites such as Weibo, Zhihu, and YouTube [4] . Misinformation is consequently widely transmitted and starts trending on social media platforms [10] . Notably, health information is one of the information sources that attracts the most attention but is most severely affected by misinformation [11] .",

The consensus of the scientific community provides a relatively clear distinction between true information and misinformation. Health misinformation, which is the focus of this study, is contrary to the cognitive consensus of the scientific community on a certain phenomenon [14] . There are three modes of handling misinformation. The first mode is preemptive prevention. In this mode, true information is transmitted to the public before it is subject to misinformation. Therefore, relevant studies focus on the acceptance of health information [15] . The second mode utilizes the withdrawal or deletion of misinformation. Some studies have prioritized the identification of misinformation and discontinution of its dissemination in time [16] . Although this mode is conducive to mitigating the impact of misinformation, it does not eliminate it [17] . The third, and often the most effective, mode when individuals pursue accuracy motivational goals in processing scientific information includes explanation and correction. This mode is the focus of this study. Correction provides information about beliefs that individuals may hold, stemming from previous contact and communication [18] .",

Thus, to successfully right users' cognitive errors, corrective health information must convince them. This study differs from past studies in terms of information adoption, because correcting misinformation means the original beliefs held by information recipients must be changed. Misinformation rebuttals are messages telling individuals to ignore or disbelieve previous information [18] . In other words, persuasive knowledge is required for information recipients under high-level cognitive conflicts. Additionally, professional knowledge is needed for such refusal of health misinformation to occur, because it is more difficult for the public to cognitively process health information than other types of information. To our knowledge, no prior study evaluated the impact of information recipients' cognitive conflicts and knowledge self-confidence while refuting health misinformation.",

The elaboration likelihood model (ELM), proposed by psychologists Petty and Cacioppoti, is one of the most authoritative theories in the field of knowledge persuasion [21] . It has been widely used to describe how people process information and form their attitudes toward behaviors. According to the ELM, persuasion can be achieved through one or both of the following routes: the central and peripheral routes. The central route of persuasion focuses on information factors. In this route, the information recipient inputs a large number of cognitive resources for the elaborate processing of information to produce the perception of contacted information [22] . In comparison, the peripheral route of persuasion focuses on irrelevant factors, such as the source and presentation of information. In this route, the recipient processes information on the low level [23] . Both routes signify that one's attitudes take shape or vary according to intrinsic information processing capabilities [24] . Previous empirical studies have verified the application of the ELM in various fields. For example, the ELM and technology acceptance model (TAM) can be combined to study how knowledge-based employees evaluate information and accept advice [24] . Chung et al. studied the adoption of tourist information on social media through the ELM and explored the moderating roles of social presence [25] . Tseng and Wang investigated the information adoption process on tourist websites regarding cognitive risks through the integrated model of ELM and perceived usefulness [26] .",

High-quality information has a significant impact on the persuasion effect [30] , and it plays a role in changing people's attitudes, even when they are concerned about privacy [22] . Conversely, low-quality, irrational, and non-persuasive information has no significant impact on recipients' attitudes [31] . Excessive advertisements and misleading health information on social media make it more difficult for users to identify whether the information is true or false. Health information with high perceived quality would have an increasingly vital role in determining people's trust in health information [15] . Typically, the information quality of Internet health information is generally affected by relevance, understandability (i.e., clarity and readability), adequacy (i.e., sufficiency, completeness, and necessity), and usefulness [29, 32] .

Individuals are more inclined to believe information from a highly reliable source rather than a source with low reliability [36] . The misinformation rebuttals on the Internet do not exist independently but are overshadowed by a large number of true or false information flows [37] . Understandably, source credibility allows people to handle information through the peripheral route rather than rely on complicated cognitive processing [21] . Many virtual communities infer the credibility of a knowledge source through the user influence system based on historical contributions and published records [38] . The user's authority is valid for judging the source credibility of microblog information [39] . The recipient's decision-making process will be more affected by the provider if the knowledge provider has a high level of professional knowledge [40] .

Perceived information quality is a subjective evaluation of information content and depends on the individual's previous experience and professional knowledge [21] . Both one's knowledge and skills can be employed to handle information. In some cases, the content of information is read, processed, and considered, and in other cases, the content may be neglected entirely. Such differences may result from recipients' different interpretations of knowledge content [24, 50] . In the peripheral route, impacts are mainly created through simple decision-making standards and clues such as reputation, charisma, or appeal [22] . Individuals may use such clues because they do not want to invest necessary cognitive resources or do not make an effort owing to limited capacities. When judging the authenticity of information through source credibility, users need not have complicated cognitive processing for strongly professional health information. Non-expert users are more inclined to rely on what are known as marginal clues (i.e., source credibility) [51, 52] .

Convergent validity was evaluated through item loadings, CR, and average variance extracted (AVE). As illustrated in Tables 3 and 4 , the values of item loadings and CR were larger than 0.7, and the AVE values were larger than 0.5, meaning the data had satisfactory convergent validity [61] . Discriminant validity was appraised by comparing the square root of the AVE of each construct to the inter-construct correlations, and by comparing the item loadings to the cross-loadings. Moreover, the heterotrait-monotrait ratio (HTMT) is usually no more than 0.85, and when the concepts of perspectives are similar, the HTMT threshold can be extended to 0.90 [62] . Table 5 shows that the square root of the AVE of each construct was greater than the inter-construct correlations. Similarly, Table 4 depicts that all item loadings were higher on their factor than on any other factor. Table 6 shows that most HTMT was no more than 0.85, and all HTMT was no more than 0.90. These results confirmed the discriminant validity. ",

Under some circumstances, the influence of the information itself on information credibility may be more important than the information source. Moreover, under circumstances wherein the harmful effects of health misinformation are relatively weak (not enough to attract the attention of authorities and many experts), the science involved in correcting health information is relatively simple, or it is difficult to verify that information through practice (e.g., measurement of calcium content in bone soup). Cho et al. (2011) found that information from different sources may have the same influence, for example, whether the recipient is told that the information comes from research funded by \"ExxonMobil\" or \"people like you\" [63] . These findings suggest that the factors of source reliability may be overlooked sometimes. Additionally, the crux of the information is often easier to remember than the source, and compelling stories from unreliable sources may be recalled or accepted long after the sources are forgotten [4] . However, it is difficult to accurately judge whether the health information is credible or not based only on the information content itself [64] . Focusing on the information source can reduce the sharing of false information [65] . Nonetheless, the combined effect of information quality and source reliability can enhance information credibility to a greater extent. Caulfield recommended that accurate information of value to the public must be shared and called on scientists to participate in science-related communication on social media [66] .",

Public demand for information adequacy is not high. Information overload, similar to information scarcity, can be a hindrance; therefore, a full and comprehensive exposition of information is not necessary in some cases. People should take action to disseminate high-quality information globally that is accurate, easy to digest, engaging, and easy to share on mobile devices. Information must be customized to the recipient, since different people can perceive the same things in dramatically different ways.

In practice, however, it often is difficult for the public to determine a source's reliability. When people are confused about who can provide accurate information, it would be helpful to provide users with clearer indicators of the reliability of a source. Therefore, social media could rate information sources, such as through expert ratings (expert ratings of articles) and user rating of articles or information sources. Messages are popular mainly because influencers share them with their audiences [67] . Communicators with high credibility should pay attention to the authenticity of health information before they disseminate it to their followers, as individuals and businesses with a large social media audience have a greater responsibility to verify the accuracy of any health information they share. They should refer to points from real medical reports and authoritative experts, only forward information from trusted health knowledge providers, and make full use of the authority effect and platform effect to improve information credibility.",

When cognitive conflict is high, the influence of information quality on perceived information credibility is hampered, while the effect of source credibility on perceived information credibility is enhanced. People evaluate the logical compatibility of the information they receive with other facts and beliefs. Once information is accepted, it is highly impervious to change. From the perspective of cognitive consistency, this resistance stems from subsequent inconsistencies in the information that result from the refusal to admit that previous information is false. Thus, conflict with existing knowledge reduces the likelihood that it will be successfully corrected. If there is insufficient evidence that the original perception is wrong, the easiest way to resolve this conflict may be to revert to the original idea and ignore the corrective input.",

At this point, it is easier to persuade a person or medium that is highly trusted by the receiver of the message to disprove the misinformation. Evidently, inconsistent information can trigger negative emotions and increase the difficulty for the receiver to process the information.

Moreover, higher cognitive receivers need higher-quality persuasive arguments to persuade them to change their original beliefs. Contrariwise, this phenomenon may be attributable to the professionalism of health information. Hence, an audience with higher knowledge self-confidence trusts its original cognition or professional level but does not exclude that which it believes is inaccurate. Reliance on false knowledge is not the same as ignorance, which is lack of relevant knowledge. Ignorance can have significant adverse effects on decisions, but these effects may not be as severe as the impact of trust in false knowledge. When people lack knowledge, they often rely on simple heuristics for making decisions. Overall, they have a relatively low level of confidence in decisions based solely on heuristics [68, 69] . In other words, ignorance rarely leads to strong support for an idea, but if there is a high level of confidence in one's knowledge, this support is often powerful. For example, individuals who oppose the scientific evidence for climate change most strongly are usually those who think they are experts on the subject [70] . Pre-existing scientific knowledge may influence the interpretation of newly received scientific knowledge [4] . When individuals are confident in their knowledge, but they cannot make a reasonable explanation with their original knowledge, they may be more difficult to be persuaded. This may be because an audience with high knowledge self-confidence has higher requirements regarding scientific explanations and information quality.",

Besides, the information should be transmitted by highly reliable transmitters, including the government or authoritative medical institutions. This will help enhance the public's perception of information credibility. Second, the existence of cognitive conflict increases the difficulty of refuting misinformation. Misinformation refutation by credible communicators, such as governments and authoritative medical experts trusted by information receivers, can get twice the result with half the effort. Social media platforms that share health information should control the quality of information and identify and filter unhealthy information in a timely manner. Moreover, credit rating and other markers are used to distinguish the credibility of information publishers and reduce the difficulty in users' cognitive processing. Lastly, users have different degrees of understanding of health professional information, and users with high knowledge self-confidence are the groups that find it more difficult to change their attitude. On the one hand, social media platforms can obtain correct information before users are exposed to health misinformation by means such as changing information presentation order.
