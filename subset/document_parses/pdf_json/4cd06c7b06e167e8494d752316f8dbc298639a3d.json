This virus causes respiratory disease (for instance, flu) with symptoms such as cough, fever and, in severe cases, pneumonia. The test to detect the presence of this virus in humans is performed on sputum or blood samples and the outcome is generally available within a few hours or, at most, days. Analysing biomedical imaging the patient shows signs of pneumonia. In this paper, with the aim of providing a fully automatic and faster diagnosis, we propose the adoption of deep learning for COVID-19 detection from X-rays.",

This is what happened at the end of 2019, when the 2019 coronavirus (COVID-19, acronym of COronaVIrus Disease 19 ) 1 , a new kind of coronavirus never previously detected in humans, appeared. The first cases were found during the pandemic of 2019-2020 [4] , which probably started at the end of December 2019 in the city of Wuhan [5] , the capital of the Chinese province of Hubei, and subsequently spread to several countries around the world. As confirmation of the rapid spread of the disease in January 28 2020 there were more than 4,600 COVID-19 confirmed cases in a plethora of countries and 106 deaths while on February 15 (in a time-window less than a month) these data had already risen to 49,053 cases and 1,381 deaths 2 . As of January 23 2020, the city of Wuhan has been quarantined with the suspension of all public transports into and out of the city. These measures were extended the following day to the neighboring cities of Huanggang, Ezhou, Chibi, Jingzhou and Zhijiang. Moreover, further limitations and controls have been adopted in many areas of the world, also in Europe where several cases have also been recorded. The country most affected in Europe in the month of March 2020 is Italy [6] . In fact, in April 5 2020, approximately 15.9 thousand deaths were reported by the Italian authorities, of which 8.9 thousand in the region of Lombardia, 2.1 thousand in Emilia-Romagna the region, and 1.2 thousand in the region of Piedmont, the regions mostly hit. In March 19 2020, the number of coronavirus deaths in Italy exceeded that registered in China 3 . From a clinical point of view the COVID-19 infection caused clusters of fatal pneumonia with clinical presentation greatly resembling SARS-CoV. In fact, patients experience flu-like symptoms such as fever, dry cough, tiredness, difficulty breathing. In more severe cases, often found in subjects already burdened by previous diseases, pneumonia develops, acute renal failure, up to even death [4] , but this new coronavirus presents several unique features [7] .",

In addition, a low rate of false positives is required to avoid further increasing the burden on the healthcare system by unnecessarily exposing patients to quarantine if that is not required.

As a matter of fact, ten well-known convolutional neural networks were used: AlexNet, VGG-16, VGG-19, SqueezeNet, GoogleNet, MobileNet-V2, ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-101, and Xception. Authors state that the best accuracy was achieved by the ResNet-101 and Xception models. ResNet-101 could distinguish COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 cases with an accuracy equal to accuracy, while the Xception model obtained an accuracy equal to accuracy 0.99. The several networks were evaluated with a dataset composed by 1020 CT slices obtained from 108 patients with afflicted by COVID-19 and 86 patients with other atypical and viral pneumonia diseases.",

We propose and evaluate an approach based on transfer learning by exploiting the VGG-16 model: we built two models, the first one aimed to detect whether a chest X-ray is related to a healthy patient of to a patient with generic pulmonary disease. In case the X-ray is marked with generic pulmonary disease, we input the X-ray to a second model, aimed to detect whether the pulmonary disease is COVID-19. Moreover, we highlight the areas that the models identified as discriminating for COVID-19, to provide explainability. As shows by the experimental results, obtained considering two different data-sets for a total of 6,523 chest X-rays, show an accuracy of 0.96 for the discrimination between healthy and generic pulmonary disease patients, and an accuracy of 0.98 for the COVID-19 detection. As future work, we plan to evaluate the proposed method on a wider set of pulmonary diseases. Moreover we, will investigate if formal verification techniques [52, 53] can be helpful to obtain better results in terms of accuracy.",
