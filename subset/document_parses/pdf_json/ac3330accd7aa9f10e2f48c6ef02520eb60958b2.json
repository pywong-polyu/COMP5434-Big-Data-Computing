Since hospitals present a high risk of infection -through COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic health workers -deferable access, including non-urgent clinical activities, have been suspended (1) . Thus there was a need to develop alternative solutions, as the demand for healthcare does not disappear, to continue providing healthcare for the population. These solutions included mobile clinics and home-based care, thus reducing access to hospitals, exposure to gatherings of people and consumption of protective equipment (2) . One solution is telephone interview that allows patients to remain in their own home. This can be suitable for the health-care of urological patients, as previous reports have shown it to be feasible and associated with good patients satisfaction (3). In female pelvic reconstructive surgery, telephone interview has been proposed for interview of patients undergoing midurethral tapes, as a screening tool to identify patients who need conventional clinical consultation (4, 5) . Recently, the Phone Study compared telephonic and clinic interview results after pelvic organ prolapse and anti-incontinence surgery in female patients and demonstrated the feasibility and reliability of a telemedical procedure (6) . In the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, telephone interview may be even more J Turk Ger Gynecol Assoc 2021; 22: [8] [9] [10] [11] appropriate, to limit the contagion. Therefore, we decided to perform telemedicine using a symptom related questionnaire for patients with non-urgent outpatient visits suspended due to COVID-19. We hypothesized that patients would appreciate this alternative approach to maintain care continuity. Specifically, we aimed to evaluate patients' satisfaction for telephone interview in terms of appropriateness and quality of healthcare service provided.",

Phone interviews using a validated questionnaire appeared to be appreciated and an effective tool to safely perform interview of patients with functional disorders. This approach involves several advantages. The first is the \"forward triage\", the capability to sort patients with urgent need for care from those who can safely postpone the conventional clinical examination. In this way it was possible to reduce community exposure for people with functional urologic disorders, which may potentially be looking for alternative health providers, such as inappropriate emergency room access or general practitioners consultation. This is extremely important, since these patients are often elderly and frail, and more prone to develop severe and life-threatening complications in case of COVID-19. Moreover, for functional disorders, telephone interview can often be adequate to address symptoms referred by patients, and set up an initial diagnostic or therapeutic path. At the same time, this procedure, acting as a screening tool, avoids neglecting serious conditions that require medical evaluation. One more aspect of the telephone interview is the capability to provide additional social support for patients living through the pandemic, who are lonely, anxious and fearful of abandonment. It was evident from our cohort that these emotions are widespread among patients compelled to stay home for days or weeks due to COVID-19 lockdown. The very high levels of satisfaction expressed by our patients can probably be explained in part by the human aspect of the conversation, besides clinical contents, that was particularly appreciated. Moreover, this telephonic approach reduced the consumption of protective equipment and clinicians' exposure to contagion. This is particularly relevant considering that large numbers of health care workers having to quarantine would impact the capacity of health institutions to face the current COVID-19 emergency. Lastly, this telehealth approach could be conducted by quarantined health workers, with both patient and clinician at home, greatly optimizing resources and permitting uninterrupted care of established patients (9) .",
