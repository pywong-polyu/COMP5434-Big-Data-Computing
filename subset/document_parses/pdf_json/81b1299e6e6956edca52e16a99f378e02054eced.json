At the same time, if we consider the University context, there is little attention paid during basic nursing education to emergency response, and faculty members report feeling poorly prepared to teach students about this topic. The present study aims to investigate how the Covid-19 pandemic condition influenced the psychological well-being of the Italian nursing students. Methods: An online questionnaire was administered to Italian nursing students which contains two parts: a demographic section and the assessment to the psychological well-being nursing student with the Impact of Event Scale-Revised and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. Results: Given the emergency health situation from Covid-19, our initial concern was to find a large number of students with difficulties in mentally processing this situation even with problems such as depression, as their future profession is heavily involved in the management of this pandemic. Fortunately our results have denied our initial hypothesis since both the impact management levels of the event, assessed with the IES-R scale, and the depression levels, assessed with the PHQ-9 recorded values that were almost normal. Conclusions: Nursing students are better able to face the situation since they find themselves in the role of spectators and not in the role of actors in the care of patients with Covid-19. If the training ameliorates psychological well being, therefore, it is necessary to provide and preserve nurses expertise to encourage teaching in nursing degree courses on maxi emergencies to prepare future nurses to face them adequately.

In addition, in the collection of socio-demographic data, we wanted to consider beyond the age groups, the Regions to which the Italian universities belonged. The guiding thought was dictated by the epidemiological trend of the pandemic as the regions of northern Italy were more affected than the regions of central and southern Italy. Furthermore, the year of attendance of the course was asked as we expected that students enrolled in the third and final year of the degree course could show greater difficulties in dealing with the situation and register a worse depressive state since they were now close to becoming nurses. We honestly would have expected a higher number of responses to the questionnaires, instead the rating answer was 28.5%. Instead in our predictions we thought we could reach the 1000 questionnaires completed in the period of time considered. Female students responded in more numbers (85.97%) than male students (14.03%). Mostly nurses aged between 21 and 30 responded, mostly attending the degree course in a region of southern Italy (41.75%) and northern Italy (38.95%).

Also interesting is the finding of a statistically significant difference in the last PHQ-9 question re-garding the reduced functionality felt by the respondents due to their depressive state. Even in this case it is greater in the female sex, while for the other variables they are not highlighted important differences. Therefore our data show that the gender variable is an important determinant in the values of IES-R and PHQ-9 compared to the other socio-demographic variables considered. The data collected also shows a high percentage of students from the universities of southern Italy and this could be connected to the fact that the project was advertised by the students from a university in southern Italy. The other important percentage of students involved in the study belongs to the universities of northern Italy and in this case, there being a greater incidence of the number of new cases per day in these regions, perhaps the students felt more sensitized to the pandemic problem.",

In the Italian literature there are no studies similar on ours for the purpose and design of the study. However, in the international literature there are few studies which have evaluated the psychological condition or the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic influenced students, particularly nursing and medicine students. For example in the Spanish study (21) it was also administered an online questionnaire about knowledge to prevent the transmission of COVID-19 and on the other hand it was assessed confidence and willingness to deal with infected cases. A total of 102 questionnaires were collected in 24 hours. Most of the sample believed that their health state was good. 65.3% did not feel prepared or were barely prepared to attend to cases of COVID-19, although 74.2% were willing to do so if the situation required it, and assumed moral responsibility to care for infected patients. These data are in agreement with our data since on the whole also the students recruited in our study showed a good level of situation management (IES-R values) and in any case there are not many students who have registered a moderate depressive level-serious entity. The study conducted in China can be considered as similar on our study for purposes and results. It was conducted between 22 and 28 March 2020 to explore the mental health status, particularly anxiety and depression in the general population, healthcare professionals, university students during the COVID-19 outbreak. In this study, depressive status was assessed thanks to the PHQ-9 and it was found that the most severe levels of depression are recorded in the female participants. In this sense, our data agree with these as our data also showed a greater depressive state among female students. The studies so far considered and those previously published on other health emergencies such as SARS or other pandemic influential, all contribute to the importance of universities in the implementation of teaching courses dedicated to the maxi health emergencies management (22) .",
