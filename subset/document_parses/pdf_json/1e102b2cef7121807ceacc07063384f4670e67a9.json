[9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] In China, patients can choose to go to the outpatient department of any health facility without a referral letter, 15 ",

            "text": "Open access residents mainly seek healthcare from township health centres or village clinics, the two lowest-level health facilities in China's rural healthcare system. If patients develop severe symptoms, they are more likely to go directly to the outpatient clinic in the county hospital. 15 16 Many patients attend village clinics and township health centres with respiratory tract infections (RTIs) such as common cold, sore throat, and acute bronchitis and are frequently prescribed antibiotics even though most cases are likely to be viral and antibiotics are therefore unnecessary [17] [18] [19] [20] Our previous study found that the antibiotic prescribing rate for RTI patients was up to 85% in rural Anhui Province. 21 In addition to the implications for AMR, there is a cost to patients 22 23 for extra health resource utilisation (consultation fees, medication costs, loss of productivity costs), most of which would not be reimbursed through national medical insurance schemes. Therefore, reducing antibiotic prescribing in village clinics and township health centres is likely to be both safe and economically beneficial to patients. Since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, village clinics have periodically been prohibited from providing treatment to RTI patients; therefore, this trial focuses on provision of care in township health centres. Township health centres in China are staffed with both qualified doctors and some health practitioners who are usually referred to as 'village practitioners' but would not have a degree in medicine. Village practitioners are required to undergo basic training in healthcare provided by the local healthcare authority issued with a medical practice licence. Antibiotic prescribing in township health centres is influenced by uncertainty about which RTI need antibiotics and by widespread beliefs that common infections should be treated with antibiotics. 15 Practitioners are also concerned about losing patients and believe that prescribing antibiotics helps maintain good relationships with their patients. Public campaigns on antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) [23] [24] [25] are very limited in rural areas and there is little technical support for village and township practitioners from senior clinical consultants and healthcare authorities, which makes it difficult for them to change norms of high antibiotic use.",

However, in May 2021, there was a small local COVID-19 outbreak in Anhui Province, since when village clinics have not been allowed to treat RTI patients in Anhui and our trial recruitment had to be postponed. Currently, patients with suspected COVID-19 symptoms (specifically patients with a temperature of more than 37.3\u00b0) must be referred to specialist COVID-19 clinics or specialist COVID-19 hospitals for treatment. We did some preliminary fieldwork in June 2021 and found it is still very difficult to recruit RTI patients at village clinic level and the research team assessed that this situation may not change within the next 12 months. However, we found that township health centres are still able to treat RTI patients regularly. In order to complete recruitment and maintain trial feasibility, we therefore decide to change the recruitment sites from village clinics to township health centres. We will recruit 40 township health centres from 10 counties (4 township health centres per county), those counties will be randomly selected from 4 regions geographically dispersed across Anhui Province. We will randomly recruit 6 counties from two regions in densely populated North Anhui and four counties from another two regions from sparsely populated South Anhui. We will seek support from local county health authorities during the recruitment of township health centres. They will provide a list of townships in their area and the research team will randomly select four township health centres. Local county health authorities will screen the selected townships and may exclude selected townships, for which a reason will be recorded.",

These were codesigned with practitioners and patients using the person-based approach method for intervention development. 26 We optimised the intervention tools using qualitative research to identify barriers to acceptability, feasibility and engagement that need to be addressed. We conducted four rounds of 'think-aloud' interviews with 37 practitioners (15 from township health centres and 22 from village clinics) and 17 Patients in rural Anhui. Think-aloud interviews obtained detailed user views by asking practitioners and patients to view contents of our intervention tools (training materials for practitioners, peer support groups, computer-based treatment decision support system, patient leaflet). Findings were immediately tabulated and analysed to identify changes required, modified materials used for the next round of thinkaloud interviews and the process repeated until participant feedback indicated no further important, feasible and appropriate changes were needed. Through this process, we created a feasible and generalisable intervention to reduce antibiotic prescribing tailored for the rural Chinese context. As an important element of the intervention, our computer-based treatment decision support system is adapted from a previous project where we set up a web-based just-in-time information system, and our colleagues had already tested the feasibility and acceptance of the system with a pilot study. 27 Additionally, we organised several trial steering group meetings where the intervention tools and its feasibility and generalisability were intensively discussed before we launched the trial.",
