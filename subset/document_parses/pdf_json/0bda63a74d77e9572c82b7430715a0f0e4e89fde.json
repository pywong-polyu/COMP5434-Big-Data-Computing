Such studies are providing precious insights about the pathogenesis, evolution, strengths and weaknesses of the virus. As of October 1 st , 2020, 323 SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been sequenced across Bangladesh. The current study is aimed at answering some vital questions about these sequences. From our analyses, it was discovered that the majority of the SARS-CoV-2 found in Bangladesh belonged to the lineage B 1.1.25 of GR clade. Dhaka and Chittagong division were the most diverse in terms of SARS-CoV-2 clades while Mymensing was the least. There are more variety of clades in southern parts of Bangladesh than the northern parts.",

Even though no significant pattern of distribution could be drawn between mutations found in Bangladesh and the countries with similar mortality rates and the countries with large Bangladeshi diaspora, to a certain degree they match with those in the UK, Oman, Italy, Greece, South Africa and Russia. Therefore, careful eye should be kept on the performance of vaccines in those countries in the near future as they are likely to work well in Bangladesh if they work well there. Mutational events in Bangladesh were found to increase between April and July, 2020 and decrease since August, 2020. The number of mutations per SARS-CoV-2 virus sample in Bangladesh was calculated to be 6.88 which is lower than the global average of 7.23. The decrease and the lower rate of mutation raise the possibility of a vaccine or drug working sustainably to protect the people. Based on these insights, a clear picture about the ongoing pandemic can be drawn in the context of Bangladesh which will help the country take appropriate measures to combat the virus.",

[1] - [5] Insights regarding the transmission and evolution of the virus during this first wave are essential to break the subsequent chain of infections. [6] , [7] Genomic data can provide some of these crucial insights which can help make upgraded public health policies. [8] , [9] Besides, genomic surveillance can deliver deep understandings about the virus and reduce fatality during any new wave of infection. [10] - [13] The onset of SARS-CoV-2 occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December, 2019 [14] - [16] . Initially, clinicians diagnosed this disease as virus-induced pneumonia based on blood tests and chest radiographs. Later, the analysis of genomic data and phylogenetic tree led to the recognition of the pathogen as a member of the Coronaviridae family. [17] Coronaviridae family encompasses the largest known enveloped, single stranded RNA viruses with genome size ranging from 25-32 kilo base pairs (Kb) [18] , [19] . The family is divided into two subfamilies, the Coronavirinae and the Toronavirinae. The subfamily Coronavirinae is further organized genotypically and serologically into 4 genera: \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, and \u03b4-CoVs. [20] The betacoronavirus genus of SARS-Cov-2 has a 79.6% identity with SARS-CoV/ SARS-CoV-1 and 67.06% identity with MERS-CoV, indicating that they belong to the betacoronavirus genus. [21] All human coronaviruses are considered to be of zoonotic origin, with Chinese bats being the most likely host for SARS-CoV-2 [22] - [24] . Genetically, about 96% identity was observed between SARS-CoV-2 and bat coronavirus (BatCoV RaTG13). [17] Conversely, since bat habitats remain distanced from human life, the virus may have involved an intermediate animal such as pangolins before transmitting to humans. [25] - [29] China Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) primarily suggested the Huanan local seafood market as the origin of the COVID-19 outbreak. [30] Despite this, none of the animals in the area were tested positive for the virus. This suggests that the virus has already moved around Wuhan, long before its outbreak.

Today, it has been labelled as the second-most affected country in South Asia. [33] The country with limited finance, and scarce facilities experiences major challenges at combating this transmission. The first case of this virus was confirmed in two men coming from Italy and a female relative by the country's epidemiology institute, the Institute of Epidemiology, Disease Control and Research (IEDCR) on March 7 th , 2020. Although many Bangladeshi citizens came from Wuhan beforehand, they were reported negative for SARS-CoV-2. As a response, Bangladesh government took a number of preventive measures including imposing restrictions on international flights, strengthening of screening procedures and shutting down of educational institutions and so on. [34] The first complete genome sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh was announced by Child Health Research Foundation on 12 th May, 2020. [35] Soon after, National Institute of Biotechnology announced the sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genome by Sanger sequencing method [36] . The SARS-CoV-2 genome sequencing effort in Bangladesh flourished afterwards and as a result, 323 genomes have been sequenced by October 1 st , 2020. The goal of this study is to probe all these sequences and find some crucial answers which will make it easier to comprehend the trajectory of this pandemic in Bangladesh.",

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that among the SARS-CoV-2 viruses detected in Bangladesh, the ones belonging to GH and GR clades originated in the UK, the ones in G and O clades in Italy and the ones in S and O clades originated in China. The most commonly found mutant SARS-CoV-2 in Bangladesh were Spike_D614G, NSP12_P323L, N_G204R and N_R203K. Therefore vaccines and drugs targeting these mutants are likely to work best in the country. The distribution of predominant mutations have been found to be similar in between Bangladesh and the countries with similar mortality rates due to COVID-19 and the countries with large Bangladeshi diaspora although their level varied greatly and so no concrete pattern could be drawn between Bangladesh and these countries. However, the distribution of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genomes in Bangladesh somewhat matches that in the UK, Oman, Italy, Greece, South Africa and Russia. Therefore, in the near future, close attention should be paid to vaccines working in those countries. If they work well there, there is a good chance they might work well also in Bangladesh. The good news for Bangladesh is that the number of mutations per sample in the country has turned out to be lower than the global average. The rate of mutation has been found to be decreasing in Bangladesh since August, 2020. These features are likely to make it easier for a vaccine or drug to be effective and sustainable in providing protection for the Bangladeshi population.",

The root of these major groups were identified in UK (Supplementary File 1). Both B 1.1.25 and B 1.1 represented 1 and 2 isolates from G clade respectively. B.1 of G and O clades have 10 isolates totally. Only two members were found in B.1.1.59 and B.1.1.60 of GR clade. These members share common genomic features with Wales and Northern Ireland.
