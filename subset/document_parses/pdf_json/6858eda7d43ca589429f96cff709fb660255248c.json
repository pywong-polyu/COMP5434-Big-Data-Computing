It is also linked to the perception that one's life is meaningful (Cann et al., 2010a) . Therefore, the evidence demonstrates that PTG is a relevant outcome to be measured in people who have experienced major life crises. The COVID-19 health crisis may be considered a global disaster that, by March 11 th , 2021 (just one year after the World Health Organization -WHO-declared it as a pandemic), had caused more than 2.6 million deaths worldwide (WHO, 2021) . Many studies have explored the psychological impact of this PTE in terms of stress, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Their collective results show that the COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a massive psychological impact worldwide (e.g., see the meta-analysis by Salari et al., 2020) , including Spain (Gonz\u00e1lez-Sanguino et al., 2020; Rodr\u00edguez-Rey et al., 2020) . Fewer studies have explored the prevalence of PTG in connection with the COVID-19 health crisis. Although limited in number, their results indicate that growth may be a positive psychological consequence of the COVID-19 health crisis in different samples, such as the general population in Spain (Prieto-Urs\u00faa & J\u00f3dar, 2020; V\u00e1zquez et al., 2021) , Greece (Koliouli & Canellopoulos, 2021) and Turkey (Ikizer et al., 2021) , and in specific population groups such as nurses (Chen et al., 2021) and high school students (Yu et al., 2021) .",

It was developed by Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) and seeks to record PTG in five relevant domains: 1) Relating to Others, which refers to deepened relationships with others, and a greater appreciation of social support after encountering a PTE (e.g., \"I have a greater sense of closeness with others\"); 2) New Possibilities, referring to the perception of positive changes in the self after experiencing a PTE, which leads to the discovery of new life opportunities (e.g., \"I am able to do better things with my life\"); 3) Personal Strength, which involves positive changes to self-perception that make the individual feel more capable of overcoming difficulties (e.g., \"I discovered that I'm stronger than I thought I was\"); 4) Spiritual Change, which refers to strengthened spiritual and/or religious beliefs in the aftermath of a PTE (e.g., \"I have a better understanding of spiritual matters\"); and 5) Appreciation of Life, or a greater appreciation of one's own existence following the encounter with a PTE and leading to relevant life changes (e.g., \"I changed my priorities about what is important in life\").",

            "text": "The PTGI consists of 21 items, each rated on a 6-point-Likert scale (ranging from 0 = I did not experience this change as a result of my crisis to 5 = I experienced this change to a very great degree as a result of my crisis). In each of the five domains, changes may occur at the affective, cognitive, and behavioral levels. It has displayed adequate internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.90) and test-retest reliability (r = 0.71). The PTGI has been translated into Spanish and validated in this language by Weiss and Berger (2006) . The PTGI's five-factor structure has been supported by different studies conducted on multiple populations (e.g., Lee et al., 2010) . However, the dimensionality of this construct has been questioned, and the PTGI has been described as being formed by a single factor (e.g., Joseph et al., 2005) , three factors (e.g., Powell et al., 2003; Weiss & Berger, 2006) , and four factors (Ho et al., 2004; Taku et al., 2007) . These differences may be explained by cultural reasons. While the five original dimensions by Tedeschi and Calhoun (1996) tend to appear in highly individualistic cultures (e. g., Australia), in more collectivist countries (e. g., Guatemala) the dimensions that reflect PTG at a personal level (i.e., New Opportunities, Appreciation of Life and Personal Strength) usually appear as a single dimension (P\u00e1ez et al., 2013; Wlodarczyk et al., 2017) . et al., (2010a, 2010b ) developed a shortened version of the PTGI: the PTGI-Short Form (PTGI-SF). It measures PTG from 10 items instead of 21, thus significantly reducing the time required by responders to fill in the questionnaire with little loss of information. The PTFI-SF includes two items for each dimension of the original PTGI. These were selected due to their high loadings on the original factors and the item content. The PTGI-SF displayed adequate internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.86 to 0.89) and confirmatory factor analyses supported the five-factor structure (Cann, et al., 2010a (Cann, et al., , 2010b . It has been validated in the Spanish language with a sample of Chilean college students, showing a five-factor structure and adequate reliability (\u03b1 = 0.83; Castro et al., 2015) . To our knowledge, the psychometric properties of the PTGI-SF have not been studied on adults living in Spain. This is therefore the goal of this study, within the context of the COVID-19 health crisis. We focus on the factorial validity of the scale scores because of the (already described) varying number of factors that are reported in the literature when the PTGI is applied to new populations. Moreover, reliability and evidence of sensitivity and criterion-related validity is also examined.",

            "text": "We also sought to expand research on PTGI by including the growth that may occur at the collective or social level (P\u00e1ez et al., 2013; Wlodarczyk et al., 2017) . Examples of collective PTEs are natural disasters, wars, genocides, and terrorist attacks such as the 9/11 attacks in the United States or 11 M in Madrid (Spain). Given that the COVID-19 pandemic is a global health crisis that affects the entire population, it makes sense to explore the presence of collective PTG. This type of PTG may be especially perceived in cultures with collectivist values, such as Asian and South American cultures (P\u00e1ez et al., 2013; Wlodarczyk et al., 2017) . Spain is a more collectivistic country than the United States, Australia, or the northern and central European nations. There is closer contact with members of the community, such as neighbors, than what is experienced in other developed societies, and one's family occupies a central position (V\u00e1zquez & P\u00e1ez, 2010) . Nevertheless, the Spanish culture is considerably more individualistic than Latin American or Asian cultures, to name a few (V\u00e1zquez & P\u00e1ez, 2010; Weiss & Berger, 2006) . Given Spain's intermediate position within the individualism-collectivism spectrum (Hofstede et al., 2010; Morales et al., 2007) , it might be worth exploring whether, in the course of the COVID-19 crisis in Spain, collective growth emerges as a relevant factor different from the Relating to Others dimension. As regards instruments that measure collective PTG, while the PTGI and the PTGI-SF (both originally developed and validated in the United States) do not assess social or collective growth, some other tools to measure PTG do take them into account. For instance, P\u00e1ez et al. (2012) developed the Community Post-Traumatic Growth (CPTG) scale, which consists of 24 items that explore the presence of PTG at four levels: Personal (e.g., \"I have changed my priorities about what is important in life\"), Interpersonal (e.g., \"I have discovered the support of people who were not close to me\"), Social (e.g., \"I have discovered that my community, group, or family is stronger than I thought\") and Sociopolitical Participation (e.g., \"Political and ethical participation and commitments in the country have increased\"). By using this scale on the Spanish population during the COVID-19 pandemic, Prieto-Urs\u00faa and J\u00f3dar (2020) found similar levels of PTG across its Personal, Interpersonal, and Social/Community dimensions. This suggests that social or collective growth is indeed a consequence of the COVID-19 crisis and hence, this dimension of PTG has also been examined in this study, together with the five dimensions of the PTGI.",

            "text": "Previous studies have shown that PTG is linked to gender, age, perceived severity of the PTE, and PTSD. Two metanalytic reviews concluded that women display higher levels of PTG than men (Helgeson et al., 2006; Vishnesky et al., 2010) . Gender-based differences in PTG levels during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Spanish population also support this finding (Prieto-Urs\u00faa & J\u00f3dar, 2020). Results are less consistent when it comes to the link between PTG and age, but most studies show that younger participants tend to report higher PTG levels (Helgeson et al., 2006) . Previous studies also found a connection between the perceived severity of the PTE and PTG (e.g., Rodr\u00edguez-Rey & Alonso-Tapia, 2019). It is generally agreed that in order to experience PTG, the event and the emotional response to it must be intense and negative enough to modify the person's basic beliefs. Thus, when a PTE is not perceived as being very severe, disruptive, or traumatic, there is no opportunity for PTG to take place (Helgeson et al., 2006; Janoff-Bulman, 2004) . In line with this idea, the current literature on the topic also demonstrates a positive association between PTG and PTSD symptoms, showing that when an event is disruptive enough, both positive and negative psychological consequences tend to co-occur (e.g., metanalysis by Shakespeare-Finch & Lurie-Beck, 2014). Given these findings, we expect higher PTG scores in women, younger participants, people who perceive the COVID-19 crisis as being more severe, and participants with higher PTSD symptoms. To sum up, the goal of this study is to explore the psychometric properties of the PTGI-SF (extended to include the collective dimension of PTG) when applied to adults living in Spain during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The study was approved by the ethics committees at the authors' universities and the respondents provided informed consent prior to accessing the questionnaires.",

The one-factor model considered that the 12 items load into a single PTG latent factor. The correlational model considered that there are six first-order factors that are correlated, which correspond to the PTG dimensions: Relating to Others, New Possibilities, Personal Strength, Spiritual Change, Appreciation of Life, and Communal Growth. This second model (minus the Communal Growth dimension) is the one that is supported in the scientific literature (Cann, et al., 2010a (Cann, et al., , 2010b Castro et al., 2015) . The sample was randomly divided into two (n 1 = 428; n 2 = 427) and the models were tested on the first subsample through confirmatory factor analyses (CFA). As the variables were ordinal, we used MLMV as the estimation method (DiStefano, 2002) . The fit of the models was assessed through fit indexes (RMSEA, SRMR, CFI, TLI), following standard criteria (SRMR \u2264 0.08; RMSEA \u2264 0.08; CFI, TLI \u2265 0.90; Hair et al., 2016) . After the analysis results (e.g., factor loadings, modification indices, and content analysis) were inspected, items were discarded and once again, two models (one-factor and correlated factors) were tested with the retained items.",

Indeed, the content of those items reflect positive changes in the self, regarding how one perceives life after experiencing a PTE. Moreover, as we discussed, the previous literature supports the unification of dimensions related to personal growth in non-individualistic countries. Thus, we conducted another CFA with those four items in order to examine their factor loadings on that new factor. Items 1, 2 and 3 had similar loadings (\u03bb = 0.83), while item 6 (establishing a new path in life) had a lower loading (\u03bb = 0.67). Therefore, we discarded this item. In regard to retaining one item from each original factor, we kept the remaining item from New Opportunities (item 3, ability to do better things with life). Subsequently, we kept item 2 (appreciation of own life's value) and discarded item 1 (changing life priorities) since the content of the former was more in line with item 3.

The factorial analyses conducted through SEM showed that no distinction can be made between the PTG domains of New Opportunities and Appreciation of Life in this population. This is consistent with research that shows that these dimensions often emerge as one in collectivist countries (P\u00e1ez et al., 2013; Wlodarczyk et al., 2017) , representing personal growth. However, Personal Strength did not display such a high correlation with them, and was thus retained as a separate dimension. Spain's intermediate position within the individualism-collectivism continuum (Hofstede et al., 2010; Morales et al., 2007) may explain these results that do not conform to either individualistic or collectivistic countries, therefore resulting in a unique configuration. Similarly, no distinction could be drawn between the dimensions of Relating to Others and Communal Growth, suggesting an overlap between interpersonal and communal growth in Spain. Again, this result may indicate that Spain is not collectivistic enough for the Communal Growth dimension to appear separately. This means that the two PTGI-SF Relating to Others items capture interpersonal growth in Spain in a broad sense that appears to include social growth, as both Relating to Others and Communal Growth have some common ground: closeness, social support, etc. Congruently with this idea, Wlodarczyk et al. (2017) included two Relating to Others items that significantly loaded on the Individual Growth factor, but one of them also had a significant and even greater loading on the Communal Growth factor. The authors collected the data in Chile, a country that is much more collectivistic than Spain (Hofstede et al., 2010) , and so it seems quite plausible that these two dimensions would function as a single construct in Spain.",

Moreover, higher PTG levels were associated with the female gender, younger age, higher perceived severity of the COVID-19 crisis, and higher PTSD symptomatology, results that are consistent with previous studies (Cann, et al., 2010a (Cann, et al., , 2010b Helgeson et al., 2006; Janoff-Bulman, 2004; Prieto-Urs\u00faa & J\u00f3dar, 2020; Rodr\u00edguez-Rey & Alonso-Tapia, 2019; Shakespeare-Finch & Lurie-Beck, 2014; Vishnesky et al., 2010) . This finding supports the ability of the PTGI-8 inventory to discriminate between populations with different PTG levels and provides evidence of sensitivity and criterion-related validity.",

            "text": "It is worth paying further attention to the dimension of Spiritual Change, given that its mean score was lower than the scores of the other dimensions. This finding is in line with studies conducted on specific population groups in Spain, such as the parents of critically ill children (Rodr\u00edguez-Rey & Alonso-Tapia, 2019) and earthquake survivors (Wlodarczyk et al., 2016) . It is consistent with research showing that Spiritual Change is less pronounced in Western societies than in more religious cultures such as Latin American and African cultures (P\u00e1ez et al., 2013; Wlodarczyk et al., 2016) . This cultural variability has been acknowledged in recent research and is the cause of some concern, since there are only two Spiritual Change items in both the PTGI and the PTGI-SF, and one of them refers explicitly to religious faith (item 18 in the PTGI and 8 in the PTGI-SF). This may pose a problem in cultures that do not appear to be very religious (Tedeschi et al., 2017; V\u00e1zquez & P\u00e1ez, 2010) . This is the case of Spain, where only 27% of the population consider themselves to be very religious (V\u00e1zquez & P\u00e1ez, 2010) . Indeed, item 8 displayed a very low mean and high values for skewness and kurtosis in our sample. As a recent study on PTG following the COVID-19 health crisis in Spain has shown, both spirituality and religiosity continue to be relevant in the Spanish context (Prieto-Urs\u00faa & J\u00f3dar, 2020). However, without denying this importance, future research conducted in Western societies or with nonreligious individuals may consider other options for this item that are better able to capture the broader and more existential nature of spiritual growth experienced by non-religious individuals. This wider sense of spirituality has already been considered in newer versions of the original PTGI (Tedeschi et al., 2017) and its inclusion in the PTGI-SF might help shed some light on the possible differences in PTG as experienced by religious and non-religious people.",

Among its strengths, we may mention the relatively big sample of the Spanish adult population, with a wide diversity of ages represented, which permitted multigroup analyses to test sample invariance. However, women were overrepresented in our sample (something quite common in research, Dunn et al., 2004) , as well as people born in Spain. Thus, further research with a more gender-balanced sample is needed and until then, the findings should not be generalized to other genders or to immigrants. Moreover, given the online sampling and data collection method, there was little opportunity for people who do not use social media or electronic devices to be recruited into the study. Additionally, all our participants were asked to focus on the COVID-19 health crisis, which needs to be considered before our results may be generalized to different PTEs. Finally, more evidence of validity (especially regarding convergent and predictive validity) of the scores of this Spanish PTGI-SF must be gathered.",
