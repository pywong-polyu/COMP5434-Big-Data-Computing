            "text": "The current scale of public and private testing cannot be expected to meet the emerging need for higher levels of community-level and repeated screening of asymptomatic Canadians for SARS-CoV-2. Rapid point-of-care techniques are increasingly being deployed to fill the gap in screening levels required to identify undiagnosed individuals with high viral loads. However, rapid, point-of-care tests often have lower sensitivity in practice. Reverse transcription loopmediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 has proven sensitive and specific and provides visual results in minutes. Using a commercially available kit for RT-LAMP and primer set targetting nucleocapsid (N) gene, we tested a blinded set of 101 archived nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples with known RT-PCR results. RT-LAMP reactions were incubated at 65\u02daC for 30 minutes, using heat-inactivated nasopharyngeal swab sample in viral transport medium, diluted tenfold in water, as input. RT-LAMP agreed with all RT-PCR defined negatives (N=51), and all positives with Ct less than 20 (N=24), 65% of positives with Ct between 20-30 (N=17), and no positives with Ct greater than 30 (N=9). RT-LAMP requires fewer and different core components, so may not compete directly with the mainline testing workflow, preserving precious central laboratory resources and gold standard tests for those with the greatest need. Careful messaging must be provided when using less-sensitive tests, so that people are not falsely reassured by negative results -\"glass half empty\" -in exchange for reliable detection of those with high levels of virus within an hour, using <$10 worth of chemicals -\"glass half full\".",

Hundreds of molecular diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 have been introduced since then 3-5 . The main diagnostic targets rely on specific host antibodies, viral proteins and viral RNA, each with its own specific benefits and limitations in accurately detecting the SARS-CoV-2 infectious period to prevent its spread. The best, most sensitive examples of tests to detect each target require high levels of laboratory expertise and specialized facilities that massively increase expense and turnaround time, especially when challenged with recent, unprecedented testing volumes. In addition, high throughput platforms used in laboratories have been diverted to testing for SARS-CoV-2 at the expense of other infectious disease testing 6 .",

One early study found that RT-LAMP was more sensitive than RT-PCR at detecting virus in an asymptomatic carrier monitored for several days 22 . RT-LAMP has been tested extensively at large scale in the UK and has recently been shown to have less-than-expected sensitivity (<50%) when rolled out to large populations as part of Operation Moonshot 23 . However, similarly to the current study, sensitivity was greatest in strong positives, indicating that only those with high viral loads may reliably be detected with this diagnostic platform, especially when performed by non-experts in field settings.",

Potential inhibitors or other contaminants may reduce the reliability of both positive and negative results. This concern is somewhat lessened in the context of the current report, which we have confirmed is highly specific and can amplify target molecules even in highly diluted samples. However, the current assay's limit of detection (currently 1,000 copies/\u03bcl, similar to other studies 18 ) does decrease the likelihood of detecting a person with low viral load. In contrast, Sherlock Biosciences claims on its website (www.sherlock.bio) that its LAMP-based assay can detect 7 copies per \u03bcl VTM or up to 150 times less than this report.",

No rapid, point-of-care antibody tests have yet been approved for use in Canada. The FDA has meanwhile provided Emergency Use Authorization for dozens of diagnostics of all descriptions, from the Sherlock Biosciences LAMP/CRISPR platform to the recent LAMP-based home test by Lucira 24 . All of these tests are imperfect and do not work as well in practice as manufacturer's claim. Despite these limitations, all tests applied on a wider scale, with proper messaging about the limited significance of negative results, could be highly useful if strong positives are identified and acted upon more quickly 25 .

Developing multiple testing platforms that do not require the same instruments, reagents and laboratory infrastructure are of paramount importance in order to increase testing capacity 25 . RT-LAMP uses Bst instead of Taq for amplification, does not compete for tips and reagents for RNA extraction (if raw sample is used), and is simple enough for a trained nonspecialist to execute with oversight and support, freeing nurses and other front-line staff for less technical duties. Increased validation and application of rapid tests such as RT-LAMP is only worthwhile if it frees up central laboratories to get back to providing diagnostics services, of all kinds, to those most in need. In conclusion, scalable rapid tests, such as the one evaluated in this study, may efficiently detect individuals with high viral loads at the point of care. Our findings suggest RT-LAMP could be useful as a screening mechanism for prioritized samples within the existing test chain, reliably identifying those with highest virus concentrations hours ahead of the standard RT-PCR workflow, and able to be scaled to any required number of tests per day. Further work must focus on improving sensitivity, incorporating saliva or other self-collected samples, and triangulating evidence from different testing modalities 31 , to better ascertain an individual's infectious period.
