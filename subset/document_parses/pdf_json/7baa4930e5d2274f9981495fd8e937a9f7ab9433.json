This study contributes to the practical knowledge of user-generated online content and machine learning techniques that can be used for the analysis of UGC. For this purpose, we explore the potential of user-generated content and present an application of natural language pre-processing, text mining and sentiment analysis to the question of public satisfaction with healthcare systems. Concretely, we analyze 634 online comments reflecting attitudes towards healthcare services in different countries. Our analysis identifies the frequency of topics related to healthcare services in textual content of the comments and attempts to classify and rank national healthcare systems based on the respondents' sentiment scores. In this paper, we describe our approach, summarize our main findings, and compare them with the results from cross-national surveys. Finally, we outline the typical limitations inherent in the analysis of usergenerated online content and suggest avenues for future research.",

As a consequence, many current public opinion studies do not take a full advantage of the available information. Hence, the main purpose of this study is to explore the possibilities of UGC for the study of public opinion. We do so, by analyzing 634 online reader comments reflecting attitudes towards healthcare systems across different countries. Until now, comparative studies on public satisfaction with healthcare services have mostly utilized cross-national survey data (e.g. [23, 28, 43] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that assesses public attitudes towards healthcare system in comparative perspective using unsolicited user-generated online data. In addition to providing an example of how UGC can be used for the analysis of public attitudes, we demonstrate the practical implementation of analytical tools to explore the user-generated content.",

Considering that such data are not sampled in the conventional way, they may not be representative of the entire population. Connected with the issue of generalizability is the issue of selection bias, given that the users who post online are often self-selected. Moreover, not every topic is equally likely to be discussed by the online community. As aptly captured by Couper [9] : \"if we are to make use of the vast amount of public information on the Internet, we need more work to understand how those who willingly share information with the broader public differ from those who do not, and what kinds of topics are more or less susceptible to selection biases\" (p. 903). At the same time, it is important to remember that the generalization to the entire population is not a requirement for every study. For some research purposes, having the data on only one specific group can be of value, especially in the context of studying opinions of sub-groups or \"hard-to-reach\" populations (see, for example, [10] .",

Nevertheless, while lacking some socio-demographic information, user generate data often contain a lot of other relevant metadata that can be used in the analysis, including geographical location, frequency of posting, among others. Another challenge associated with UGC is that such data are often complex, messy, and unstructured. Therefore, the quality of UGC cannot always be guaranteed and it depends on the amount of noise in the data. This latter characteristic makes usergenerated data similar to the information obtained by qualitative research methods. At the same time, as with the qualitative data, UGC often provides richer information on specific user attitudes than do survey responses. Moreover, researchers analyzing UGC can often derive additional information on the emotional state of the individual, while such information is generally unavailable in survey data.",

Recently more traditional machine learning (ML) techniques applied to natural language processing (NLP), such as keyword extraction, topic recognition, and sentiment analysis have been enhanced by the application of deep learning methods. For example, in their recent paper Souma and colleagues [39] apply recurrent neural network (RNN) with long short-term memory (LSTM) units to forecast financial news sentiments. In another study, Naeem and colleagues [30] use a novel deep learning framework for clickbait detection on social area network. The application of deep learning methods is more technically demanding and may present an additional barrier to the wide use of UGC in public opinion research among social scientists.",

In the European context, such surveys include the Eurobarometer, the European Social Survey (ESS), and the European Quality of Life Survey (EQLS). However, implementing such surveys is costly and, similar to other international surveys, they are increasingly characterized by high non-response rate, which impacts the validity of the conclusions. In addition, the attitudes towards healthcare systems across different world regions are usually not reflected within the same survey, making it difficult to compare healthcare systems. While user-generated content containing information on healthcare evaluation is increasingly available, these online resources are yet to be utilized to their full potential. The COVID-19 pandemic has served as an impetus for a number of studies using online data. For example, Havey [19] analyzes six misinformation topics related to the COVID-19 pandemic using sentiment analysis of Twitter data. In another study, Shahsavari and colleagues [38] examine online forum discussions and news reports to detect the emergence of conspiracy theories related to the pandemic. Yet in another paper, Uyheng and Carley [41] analyze online conversation and hate speech around the COVID-19 crisis in the United States and the Philippines. These studies demonstrate the richness of insights that can be derived from the analysis of online data. In the present study, we use a particular type of UGC, namely newspaper readers' comments, to answer the following research questions about general attitudes towards healthcare systems:",

Both methods are extensively used in the studies based on computational approach (e.g. [24, 39, 40] ). The first method, word frequency analysis, as its name suggests, involves identifying most frequently used terms in the body of user comments. This technique is based on the idea that words which are most frequently used by the commenter indicate issues of higher importance to the user [35] . This method is inductive in identifying the topics of relevance, compared, for example, to the predefined structure of the survey instrument. Given the focus of this study, we were particularly interested in the most common terms related to healthcare and medical services.",

In the cases in which a particular country was mentioned more than once, we used the average compound sentiment score. The number of times that a specific country appeared in the body of comments differ greatly. For instance, the United States appeared 654 times, which is not surprising given that the comments address the article published in the U.S. newspaper. To provide other examples, France was mentioned 330 times, Germany 67 times, Mexico 40 times, and Japan 22 times. We performed accuracy check which resulted in the set of twenty-two countries with the assigned compound sentiment score. The results of the sentiment analysis indicate that when collapsed into sentiment categories, eighteen countries (82%) were assigned a positive sentiment (compound score \u2265 0.05) while four countries (18%) were assigned a neutral sentiment (compound score between \u2212 0.05 and Fig. 2 Continuous sentiment score at the country level 0.05). A number of countries were originally assigned a negative sentiment but after averaging the result the compound score turned out to be neutral or positive. Figure 2 presents the sentiment score for twenty-two countries. A continuous sentiment score shows that Israel, New Zealand, Cuba, and Denmark are associated with the most positive sentiment score, while Portugal Spain, Poland, and Italy with the least positive sentiment score. Additionally, Figure 2 presents an interesting comparison between public approval of national healthcare systems across different world regions.

Please tell me on a scale of 1-10, where 1 means very poor quality and 10 means very high quality. (a) Health services.\" The ESS asks the question in the following way: \"[still] using this card, please say what you think overall about the state of health services in [country] nowadays?, where \"0\" is \"extremely bad\" and \"10\" is \"extremely good.\" After rescaling the ESS mean scores and the sentiment scores to match the scale of the EQLS (from 1 to 10), we obtained the results presented in Table 4 and visually depicted in Fig. 4 . Although not identical, the ranking across the three sources appears to be similar. To ease the comparison, we correlated the mean scores of the ESS and the EQLS with the country sentiment scores. The results from the ESS show similar patterns to that of the EQLS and the correlation between the two country rankings is high (0.88). While lower than the correlation value between the two analyzed surveys, the correlation between sentiment scores and the EQLS mean scores is also strong and positive (0.70). The correlation between sentiment scores and the ESS mean scores is somewhat less and is considered to be moderate (0.63).",

This study provides only one preliminary examination of how user-generated data can be analyzed and future opportunities are abundant. For example, future studies may consider analyzing a larger corpus of online comments and/or different online platforms for gathering information on healthcare attitudes. While we do not consider the online user-generated content to be a direct competitor to more traditional survey data, we are certain that the richness of such data combined with appropriate analytical tools would be of great benefit to researchers of public opinion.",
