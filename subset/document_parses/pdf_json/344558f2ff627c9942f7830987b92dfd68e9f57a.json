            "text": "Background. Myocardial ischemia-reperfusion injury (MIRI) has become a thorny and unsolved clinical problem. e pathological mechanisms of MIRI are intricate and unclear, so it is of great significance to explore potential hub genes and search for some natural products that exhibit potential therapeutic efficacy on MIRI via targeting the hub genes. Methods. First, the differential expression genes (DEGs) from GSE58486, GSE108940, and GSE115568 were screened and integrated via a robust rank aggregation algorithm. en, the hub genes were identified and verified by the functional experiment of the MIRI mice. Finally, natural products with protective effects against MIRI were retrieved, and molecular docking simulations between hub genes and natural products were performed. Results. 230 integrated DEGs and 9 hub genes were identified. After verification, Emr1, Tyrobp, Itgb2, Fcgr2b, Cybb, and Fcer1g might be the most significant genes during MIRI. A total of 75 natural products were discovered. Most of them (especially araloside C, glycyrrhizic acid, ophiopogonin D, polyphyllin I, and punicalagin) showed good ability to bind the hub genes. Conclusions. Emr1, Tyrobp, Itgb2, Fcgr2b, Cybb, and Fcer1g might be critical in the pathological process of MIRI, and the natural products (araloside C, glycyrrhizic acid, ophiopogonin D, polyphyllin I, and punicalagin) targeting these hub genes exhibited potential therapeutic efficacy on MIRI. Our findings provided new insights to explore the mechanism and treatments for MIRI and revealed new therapeutic targets for natural products with protective properties against MIRI.",

Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a kind of acute and critical manifestation of CHD with high morbidity and mortality. Early rapid restoration of coronary blood flow can reduce the size of myocardial infarction and prevent further cardiac injury. With the development of reperfusion strategies such as thrombolysis and percutaneous coronary intervention, the mortality rate of AMI has been greatly reduced [2] . However, myocardial reperfusion can further cause secondary myocardial injury, which can account for 50% of the final myocardial infarct area [3] . is phenomenon, termed myocardial ischemiareperfusion injury (MIRI), has become an unsolved clinical problem and a major cause of cardiac insufficiency. Currently, there is no specific treatment for MIRI in pharmacopeia [4] . erefore, clinical and basic studies in the prevention and treatment of MIRI are active areas in the medical field.",

Iron, as an essential mineral, is an important player in the physiological functions of many tissues and organs in the human body. Studies in recent years have shown that imbalance in iron metabolism homeostasis is intimately related to the pathological process of MIRI [6] . Ferroptosis, a newly discovered form of regulated cell death, results from the imbalance in iron metabolism [6] . e occurrence of ferroptosis plays an important role during MIRI and can serve as a potential therapy for MIRI [7] . Furthermore, there are numerous other reported pathological mechanisms of MIRI including immunoreaction, autophagy, cell-derived exosomes, dysfunctional mitochondria, different forms of cell death, inflammation, oxidative stress, intracellular calcium overload, and so on [4, [8] [9] [10] . Although the pathological mechanisms of MIRI have been extensively explored, its specific pathogenesis has not been fully elucidated. erefore, plentiful work is still required to better understand the potential pathologic mechanism of MIRI at the molecular level, which may be imperative to develop more effective treatments and seek early diagnostic markers.",

In our previous study, the molecular docking technique was successfully used to predict the binding modes between 12 COVID-19 targets and the 20 compounds of Qingfei Paidu decoction that have been widely used to treat COVID-19 in China [13] . e analyses of microarray and RNA-seq gene expression data by bioinformatics have been extensively used not only to explore the diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers but also to probe crucial genes and biological processes in many diseases [14] [15] [16] [17] . However, some reasons, including the limited sample quantities, the heterogeneity of experimental samples, the use of different detection platforms, and so on, may generate deviation in the results [18, 19] . e integration of the results of multiple gene expression data sets by a robust rank aggregation (RRA) algorithm based on a statistical model that naturally allows evaluating the significance of the results is a promising strategy to overcome these shortcomings [20] . RRA has been widely used in the comprehensive analysis of multiple data sets for both oncology and non-oncology diseases [18, 19, 21] .

Despite remarkable progress in understanding the pathogenesis of MIRI, the Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine optimal treatment strategies to effectively restrict MIRI remain elusive [32] . It has been very disappointing to translate effective strategies that have been proven in many preclinical studies into better clinical outcomes [32] . ere is an undisputed unmet need between therapy and understanding the pathophysiological mechanism of MIRI.

            "text": "In this study, GSE58486, GSE108940, and GSE115568 data sets were firstly downloaded from the GEO database, and DEGs were determined. en, the multi-gene-list metaanalyses were performed to find the common GO and KEGG terms of the DEGs. Moreover, the three data sets were analyzed using the RRA method, and integrated DEGs were found. Function annotation and pathway enrichment analyses of integrated DEGs were then conducted. e results of the above functional enrichment analyses showed that DEGs might be mainly involved in regulating the extracellular matrix, cell adhesion, cell chemotaxis, inflammatory response, AGE-RAGE signaling pathway, and PI3K-Akt-mTOR signaling pathway. MIRI induces a series of sterile inflammatory reactions, which can lead to further myocardial injury. Many risk factors, including chemokines, inflammatory cytokines, inflammatory cells, complement cascades, inflammatory pathways, and so on, play important roles in the inflammatory response during MIRI through multiple interacting pathways [33, 34] . Adhesion molecules are transmembrane glycoproteins with a variety of biological activities, which are produced by cells. ey can mediate the interaction and binding between cells and cells and between cells and extracellular matrix. Adhesion molecules E-selectin and intercellular cell adhesion molecule-1 expressed on activated endothelial cells can regulate the leukocyte adhesion cascade and thus aggravate tissue inflammation in the pathological process of MIRI [35] . A study has shown that HMGB1/TLR4 signaling, as an inflammatory signaling pathway, promotes the release of inflammatory factors and aggravates MIRI by regulating the migration, adhesion, and aggregation of dendritic cells to the myocardium [36] . Substantial evidence implies the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway plays a crucial role in MIRI [37] . AGE-RAGE pathway can regulate ventricular arrhythmias, cardiomyocyte apoptosis, and contractile impairment following MIRI, which is a potential therapeutic strategy for ameliorating MIRI [37] . More recent evidence suggests that PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway protects cardiac injury from MIRI by regulating apoptosis and autophagy in cardiomyocytes [38, 39] . us, it can serve as a potential target in the setting of MIRI. According to the above studies, the results of the identified enrichment analyses in the current research play a recognized role in the pathogenesis of MIRI. We also constructed a PPI network with integrated DEGs and identified the following nine hub genes: Tyrobp, Itgb2, Emr1, Fcer1g, Fcgr1, Fcgr2b, Cybb, Cd68, and Ptprc. Consistent with the bioinformatics results, MIRI mouse model results proved that Emr1, Tyrobp, Itgb2 (synonym: CD18), Fcgr2b, Cybb, and Fcer1g were significantly higher in the MIRI group. e changing trend of CD68, Ptprc, and Fcgr1 was consistent with the bioinformatics results. ese results suggest that the results of our bioinformatics analysis may provide a reliable basis for the study of the mechanism of MIRI. e results of pathway and process enrichment analysis showed that hub genes were mainly related to microglia pathogen phagocytosis pathway, neutrophil degranulation, regulation of B-cell-mediated immunity, inflammatory response, response to lipoprotein particle, Binding score value High Low Evidence-Based Complementary and Alternative Medicine superoxide anion generation, leukocyte mediated cytotoxicity, and so on. Neutrophils, as the primary responders of MIRI, represent an important component in the protracted inflammatory response and severity related to MIRI [40] . Early research suggested that specific neutrophils degranulation within the ischemic myocardium occurred in MIRI [41] . In addition, superoxide anion generation that occurs during MIRI can further augment MIRI by enhancing the pro-oxidant activity of aconitase [42] . In summary, the enriched pathway and process of these hub genes were, in part, consistent with the pathological process of MIRI shown in previous studies.",

In the study, we searched the natural products in Chinese herbal medicine exerting protection for MIRI and discovered 75 natural products. To validate the therapeutic efficacy of natural products against MIRI via targeting the hub genes identified in this research, molecular docking simulations were performed. e results showed that most of the natural products showed a good binding ability to the hub genes, and the binding score values of araloside C, glycyrrhizic acid, ophiopogonin D, polyphyllin I, and punicalagin were the highest. We summarized the mechanism of action of natural products for the treatment of MIRI and found that anti-apoptosis, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative stress, regulating energy metabolism, reducing Ca 2+ overload, and so on were principal mechanisms, especially araloside C, glycyrrhizic acid, ophiopogonin D, polyphyllin I, and punicalagin (Supplementary  Table 2 ). Interestingly, the pathways and processes of the hub genes enrichment analyses were basically consistent with the mechanism of action of natural products. In summary, these natural products (especially araloside C, glycyrrhizic acid, ophiopogonin D, polyphyllin I, and punicalagin) provide a broad application prospect for developing more effective anti-MIRI drugs and will undoubtedly deserve in-depth investigation in the future. e following are the novelties and multiple strengths of our current research.
