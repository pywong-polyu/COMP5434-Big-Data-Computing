            "text": "The coronavirus disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has swept through the globe at an unprecedented rate. CRISPR-based detection technologies such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK, and STOPCovid have emerged as a rapid and affordable platform that can shape the future of diagnostics. Recently, we reported engineered crRNAs for Cas12a, called ENHANCE, that enables enhanced detection of nucleic acids. Here we report development, clinical validation, and advancement of ENHANCE platform for detecting SARS-CoV-2. With an RT-LAMP preamplification step, ENHANCE detects samples down to a single copy with 95% accuracy and shows high specificity towards various isolates of SARS-CoV-2 against 31 highly similar and common respiratory pathogens. Utilizing LbCas12a-mediated trans-cleavage activity, ENHANCE works robustly in a wide range of magnesium concentration (3 mM-13 mM), allowing for further assay optimization. Additionally, ENHANCEv2 is developed to further improve the previously reported ENHANCE. ENHANCEv2 employs mutated LbCas12a D156R , engineered chimeric DNAextended crRNA, and a dual reporter for both fluorescence-based reporter assay and lateral flow assay. Both ENHANCE and ENHANCEv2 are validated in 62 clinical nasopharyngeal swabs, showing 60/62 (96.7%) agreement with RT-qPCR results, and using only 5 \u00b5L of sample and 20 minutes of CRISPR reaction. Lateral flow assay on paper strips displays 100% agreement with fluorescence-based reporter assay in the clinical validation. Following a 30-minute preamplification RT-LAMP step, the lyophilized ENHANCEv2 is shown to achieve high sensitivity and specificity while reducing CRISPR reaction time to as low as 3 minutes and maintaining its detection capability upon storage at room temperature for several weeks.",

            "text": "With a global pandemic of over 72 million COVID-19 cases resulting in over 1.6 million deaths, there remains a crucial need for diagnostic tools that allow for quick yet accurate detection of SARS-CoV-2 without the requirement of expensive equipment and extensive training (1, 2). While vaccines are beginning to emerge from Phase III clinical trials and be granted Emergency Use Authorizations (EUAs) by the FDA (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) , case numbers are continuing to rise as second and third waves occur in many countries across the globe, and with treatments still somewhat limited, improvements in testing are more necessary than ever to keep both case numbers and fatality numbers down in order for preventative measures to be effective down the line (8, 9) . SARS-CoV-2 is a ~30kb betacoronavirus composed of four known structural proteins, including the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M), and envelope (E) proteins, as well as a viral RNA genome (10) . Nucleic acid detection methods often target N, E, and RdRp (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) genes. In quantitative Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-qPCR), the viral RNA is reverse transcribed into complementary DNA (cDNA) and then amplified through cyclic changing of temperatures to achieve denaturation of strands, annealing of primers to the template DNA, and extension of new complementary DNA by the addition of nucleotides by a polymerase. DNA copies are detected in real-time through the emission of fluorescence by probes that bind to the DNA. Detection using this method requires expensive equipment, clinically trained professionals and is not easily portable (11, 12) .",

            "text": "CRISPR-Cas-based methods, such as SHERLOCK (Specific High sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter unLOCKing) and DETECTR (DNA Endonuclease-Targeted CRISPR Trans Reporter) have recently received an EUA by the FDA. They take advantage of the collateral cleavage (trans) activity from Class 2 Type V and Type VI Cas proteins, specifically Cas13a and Cas12a, to cleave a FRET-based reporter resulting in fluorescence. A Cas12a-based DETECTR has a limit of detection of around 20 copies/\u00b5L, while SHERLOCK is based on Cas13a and is time-consuming (~1 hour, as opposed to ~30 min) but can detect ~ 6.75 copies/\u00b5L (table S1) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) . To amplify the target genes while accommodating for the drawbacks of traditional PCR, both COVID-19 detection platforms pair CRISPR/Cas reactions with an antecedent isothermal amplification step, with SHERLOCK utilizing Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA) and DETECTR utilizing Reverse Transcription Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (RT-LAMP). The RT-LAMP, performed at a constant temperature of 60-65\u00b0C, is significantly less time-consuming due to its \"cauliflower-like\" logistic growth amplification pattern. It is also more sensitive than RPA and can be easily adopted without supply-chain issues (21) .",

Similar to DETECTR, RT-LAMP is used for a pre-amplification step prior to the CRISPR-Cas reaction, which trans-cleaves the fluorophore from the quencher after the initial cis-cleavage of the target dsDNA. In order to validate the ENHANCE v1 system under clinical conditions, 62 nasopharyngeal samples (31 positive samples and 31 negative samples) were tested using both the fluorescencebased and lateral flow assays and then compared to RT-qPCR results. Further, we developed a lyophilized a version of ENHANCEv2 system, which utilizes modified crRNAs from ENHANCE, a mutated LbCas12a protein (Cas12a D156R ) (23) (24) (25) (26) to further amplify the signal, and a dual reporter construct that allows each sample to be read using a fluorescence-based and a lateral flow assay format in the same reaction.

These designed crRNAs bear a spacer region of greater than 50% GC content ( fig. 1B and table S2 ). In addition to previously designed crN2, crE1, and crE2 by Broughton et al. (14) , we employed three additional crRNAs (crN1, crR1, and crR2) to not only determine optimal crRNAs but also examine the modified LbCas12a trans-cleavage activity compared to the wild-type system. Consistent with our previous study, when targeting SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA, the modified crRNAs (referred to as crRNA-Mod) exhibited enhanced transcleavage activity, up to 5-fold, across all targets compared to the wild-type crRNA (crRNA-WT), indicating significantly higher fluorescence signals via the fluorophore-quencher-based reporter assay results (figs. 1C-E). Improved activity and specificity remained consistent while detecting multiple geographically distributed isolates (Hong Kong, USA, and Italy) ( fig. 1F ). The ENHANCE system works robustly with a wide range magnesium concentration (3 mM-13 mM), and especially at low magnesium concentration. Thus, ENHANCE enables a potential strategy for screening a library of guide RNAs under various reaction conditions (27) .",

Having previously modified crRNA for enhanced LbCas12a trans-cleavage activity, we sought to investigate if we could utilize LbCas12a D156R to further increase the sensitivity for nucleic acid detection purposes. As a result, the combination of LbCas12a D156R and 7-mer DNA-extended crRNA showed a significantly higher fluorescence sensitivity than the wild-type LbCas12a and crRNA and a slight enhancement compared to the combination of wild-type LbCas12a and modified crRNA ( fig. 1G ).

An estimated LoD was determined based on a criterion that the lowest copies/\u00b5L having 2/3 of replicates showing at least 5 folds in fluorescence signal compared to that of the no-template control (NTC) within 20 minutes. Out of the six modified crRNAs, crN2 and crE2 designed by Broughton et. al. exhibited the lowest LoD with 0.2 copies/\u00b5L and 7.9 copies/\u00b5L, respectively (figs. 2A-D). Hence, we selected crN2-Mod and crE2-Mod as the optimal guide RNAs for our clinical validation. The LoDs of crN2-Mod and cRE2-Mod were confirmed by testing 20 replicates of their 1x concentration (0.2 copies/\u00b5L and 7.9 copies/\u00b5L for crN2 and crE2, respectively) and 1x concentration (0.4 copies/\u00b5L and 15.8 copies/\u00b5L for crN2 and crE2, respectively). The LoD was established by observing 95% (19/20 replicates) of the target samples being positive. The replicates of both crN2-Mod and crE2-Mod at 1x concentration yielded sufficient positive results, reconfirming the LoD to be 0.2 copies/\u00b5L and 7.9 copies/\u00b5L, respectively, within 20 minutes of CRISPR reaction ( fig. 2E and F).

This reporter can be used as a fluorescence-based reporter as well as a lateral flow-based reporter, both in a single detection assay (fig. 4A). A typical CRISPR reaction requires complexation of crRNA and LbCas12a prior to addition of pre-amplified activator. Therefore, we initially sought to understand whether the complexation of crRNA and LbCas12a can be achieved and remain stable for a period of time prior to testing. If successful, large batches of pre-complexed crRNA:LbCas12a can be manufactured to reduce reaction time and minimize the need for specialized training. We explored if lyophilization can accomplish this objective. Optimal concentrations of crRNA and LbCas12a D156R were pre-complexed in a mixture containing dual reporter and cleavage buffer. This combined mixture was prepared in different pilot scales: 1 reaction, 5 reactions, and 20 reactions ( fig. 4B ). By conducting a time study, we observed that these lyophilized pre-complexes maintain high trans-cleavage activity as the liquid version and remain stable for up to 30 days upon storage at room temperature (figs. 4C and S5A). These results help enable scale-up manufacturing, ease of transportation, storage, and reduction in preparation time.",

This news gives hope to combat the COVID-19 disease that has already caused great damage to our community. However, it will take months for the vaccine to get in the hands of million people; therefore, COVID-19 testing remains a necessary tool to track the severity of the spread and to follow up the population post-vaccination. Many CRISPR-based detection platforms such as DETECTR, SHERLOCK, and STOPCovid have emerged as an alternative to traditional RT-qPCR assays due to their rapid, affordable, and sensitive capabilities (14, 18, 30) . Here, we developed ENHANCEv2, an engineered CRISPRbased diagnostic platform to detect SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples with high sensitivity and specificity.

Our previous study has shown that this modified CRISPR-Cas system significantly enhances Lbcas12a trans-cleavage activity while slightly improving its specificity (22) . The theoretical limit of detection for ENHANCEv1 was determined to be 0.2 copies/\u00b5L and 7.9 copies/\u00b5L for N gene and E gene, respectively, achieving single molecule sensitivity in a sample volume as small as 5 \u00b5L with 95% accuracy. This engineered system also exhibited high specificity towards SARS-CoV-2 when tested against highly similar and commonly circulating pathogens. Finally, ENHANCEv1 was used to validate 62 patient samples in this work, with 60/62 patients in agreement with RT-qPCR results. One false negative and one false positive were observed in 31 negative and 31 positive samples for both fluorescence-based reporter and lateral flow assay, showing a total of 96.7% accuracy. We encountered some challenging results during clinical validation of ENHANCEv1 and ENHANCEv2 with 62 patient samples. Patient sample p01 was pre-determined as negative upon arrival in our lab. The sample also indicated as negative with our ENHANCE assay, but revalidation with RT-qPCR assay indicated it as a positive sample. Therefore, we concluded that the sample was a false negative based on our analysis approach. For patient sample p43, both ENHANCE and RT-qPCR assays agreed that the sample was negative with SARS-CoV-2, but it was pre-determined as a positive sample. Thus, we concluded this sample was negative. The patient sample p12 was predetermined to be a negative sample and was detected negative with the qPCR, however, it was consistently detected as positive by ENHANCE v1 and v2 methods. Therefore, we concluded it as a false positive. Finally, QC failure .

ENHANCEv2 is comprised of a 7-mer DNA extension on the 3'-end of crRNA, a mutated LbCas12a D156R , and a dual reporter that can be used for both fluorescence-based reporter and lateral flow assays. The dual reporter enables detection of clinical samples in two different assay formats that can be potentially used for conducting a high-throughput lab-based as well as a rapid point-of-care-based test using a single CRISPR kit ( fig. S5B ). ENHANCEv2 was used to test the same 62 patient samples, showing 100% agreement with ENHANCEv1 while reducing CRISPR reaction time to as low as 3 minutes. Furthermore, unlike ENHANCEv1, the ENHANCEv2 does not require a crRNA/Cas pre-incubation step, saving 15-20 minutes of time and labor. These results were achieved by lyophilizing pre-complexed crRNA:LbCas12a in advance. The lyophilized version of ENHANCEv2 not only accelerates CRISPR reaction speed significantly but also remains stable for several weeks upon storage at room temperature.",

            "text": "Similar to SHERLOCK and DETECTR, a major drawback to this technology is the possibility of carryover contamination. CRISPR-based detection system provides two check points for detection: (1) an isothermal pre-amplification step such as RT-LAMP that converts SARS-CoV-2 genomic RNA into millions of dsDNA copies and (2) CRISPR reaction where crRNA:LbCas12a complex targets the amplified dsDNA. Since this detection platform is not a continuous step, contamination might occur. Therefore, proper reaction setup must be met. This major disadvantage motivated us to develop ENHANCEv2. ENHANCEv2 uses RT-LAMP master mix containing UDG which has been shown to greatly eliminate carryover contamination. The lyophilized CRISPR version not only significantly reduces the reaction time but also simplifies the needs for CRISPR reaction setup. The reaction can be reconstituted with the addition of RNasefree water and RT-LAMP products. The method further promotes large-scale manufacturing, eases the challenge of reagent storage and handling, and would enable easier deployment across the globe.",
