We sought to identify factors associated with hospitalization and serious COVID-19 illness in children and adults with SCD.We established the international SECURE-SCD Registry to collect data on patients with SCD and COVID-19 illness. We used multivariable logistic models to estimate the independent effects of age, sex, genotype, hydroxyurea, and SCD-related and -nonrelated comorbidities on hospitalization, serious COVID-19 illness, and pain as a presenting symptom during COVID-19 illness. As of 23 March 2021, 750 COVID-19 illness cases in patients with SCD were reported to the registry. We identified history of pain (relative risk [RR], 2.15; P , .0001) and SCD heart/lung comorbidities (RR, 1.61; P 5 .0001) as risk factors for hospitalization in children. History of pain (RR, 1.78; P 5 .002) was also a risk factor for hospitalization in adults. Children with history of pain (RR, 3.09; P 5 .009), SCD heart/lung comorbidities (RR, 1.76; P 5 .03), and SCD renal comorbidities (RR, 3.67; P , .0001) and adults with history of pain (RR 1.94, P 5 .02) were at higher risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness. History of pain and SCD renal comorbidities also increased risk of pain during COVID-19 in children; history of pain, SCD heart/lung comorbidities, and female sex increased risk of pain during COVID-19 in adults. Hydroxyurea showed no effect on hospitalization and COVID-19 severity, but it lowered the risk of presenting with pain in adults during COVID-19.",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality across the world. As of 13 April 2021, there were 135 million confirmed cases and 2.9 million deaths due to COVID-19 illness per the World Health Organization. 1 Growing evidence has shown that in the general population,individuals hospitalized due to COVID-19 illness have a higher prevalence of comorbidities compared with individuals with COVID-19 illness who did not require hospitalization. 2 Presence of hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, obesity, and malignancy are all associated with serious health outcomes during COVID-19 illness, including death, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and need for mechanical ventilation. 3 Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited hemoglobinopathy that mostly occurs among persons of African ancestry. 4 SCD affects nearly every organ system and is associated with early death, with average life expectancy estimates of $50 years. 5 Patients with SCD are known to have increased risk of death due to pneumococcal sepsis from splenic impairment and have a higher risk of complications from influenza illness. 6, 7 Prior studies also suggest that patients with SCD have a higher prevalence of viral infections and are more likely to need acute health care due to these infections compared with the general population. 8 Infection in patients with SCD can also lead to exacerbation of other SCD complications such as pain and acute chest syndrome. 9 Due to the current COVID-19 pandemic and the potential for future infectious disease epidemics, it is important to understand the impact that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) virus has on this medically vulnerable population. Recognizing the need to acquire rapid knowledge on this new infection to inform care, we established a registry for SCD patients with COVID-19 illness. This registry allowed us to show that although the majority of reported cases in the registry experienced only mild COVID-19 illness, patients with SCD were at increased risk of worse outcomes and had a higher case-fatality rate compared with the general population. 10 This work led us to further seek to understand why some patients with SCD are at increased risk of worse outcomes from COVID-19 illness as compared with others who have a milder COVID-19 illness course. Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to identify the factors associated with hospitalization and serious COVID-19 illness in patients with SCD. We hypothesized that SCD-related comorbidities would be associated with hospitalization and serious COVID-19 illness. We also hypothesized that patients taking hydroxyurea would be less likely to be hospitalized and/or experience serious COVID-19 illness. Our secondary objective was to examine the relationship between COVID-19 illness and pain in patients with SCD. We hypothesized that a history of pain would increase the likelihood of presenting with pain as a symptom during COVID-19 illness. We also hypothesized that patients who use hydroxyurea are less likely to present with pain as a symptom during COVID-19 illness.",

Generalized linear models with log link were used (binomial distribution for a binary outcome) to obtain relative risk (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Univariate and multivariable models calculated for the RR were calculated with covariates: age, sex, SCD genotype, hydroxyurea, and SCD-related and -nonrelated comorbidities on outcomes of hospitalization, serious COVID-19 illness, and pain as a presenting symptom during COVID-19 illness. We also performed a subanalysis of the adult group that included patients from 19 to 55 years of age. Hydroxyurea was forced into models because of our a priori hypothesis. Statistical significance was set at a P value of .05. All analyses were conducted with SPSS software (version 24.0; IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY). (IQR, 24-40 years). Approximately one-half of children and adults were reported to be taking hydroxyurea. There was 1 death reported in children and 18 deaths in adults, making the overall death rate 2.5%. The most common SCD-related comorbidity in both children and adults was prior acute care visit for pain (55.5% of children, 78.5% of adults) (Figure 1 ).

Another prior published study addresses clinical predictors of poor COVID-19 outcome in patients with SCD. 16 This study included patients from the early period of the pandemic and only included 9 pediatric patients.

In addition, in some of our cases, patients without pain episodes in the last 3 years presented with pain for the first time during their COVID-19 illness, which suggests that COVID-19 could potentially trigger pain in patients with SCD. Although it is unknown whether SCD acute pain would occur in these patients in the absence of COVID-19, potential mechanisms support the concept that viral infection could precipitate acute SCD pain episodes. 26, 27 First, the ACE2 protein that None of the other covariates were significant (SCD brain, non-SCD neurobehavioral, non-SCD lung, non-SCD heart comorbidities). serves as the receptor for SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, is found in human dorsal root ganglion. It is possible that SARS-CoV-2 enters the nervous system through ACE2expressing nociceptors in skin and mucosa, causing sensory neuronal infection and neuropathic pain. 26 Furthermore, although SCD is recognized as a chronic inflammatory disease, infection triggers an acute-phase reaction, activates endothelium, and generates reactive oxygen species, further exacerbating inflammation. Additionally, any infection that targets the lungs, such as with COVID-19, can lead to decreased oxygenation and consequential peripheral blood hypoxia that promotes sickling, vaso-occlusive episodes, and pain. 27 The odds of male patients presenting with pain are lower, likely due to the small number of cases. Our data suggest that patients with SCD who present with pain should be tested for COVID-19 because pain was the most common, and often only, symptom of COVID-19 in patients with SCD reported to our registry.",
