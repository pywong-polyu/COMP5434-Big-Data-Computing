Pearson and Chandler conducted interviews with human and animal healthcare professionals in Ethiopia, India, Nigeria, the Philippines, Sierra Leone and Vietnam [3] . Their finding that awareness of antimicrobial resistance did not translate to reduced prescribing is concerning. Barriers persist in contextual and structural factors such as accessibility and affordability, lack of local antibiotic information, and poor hygiene and sanitation. Contextual factors such as affordability and accessibility are also highlighted in a qualitative study of antibiotic use in rural communities in Bangladesh by Chowdhury et. al. [4] . Cultural and religious beliefs inform medicine use. Advice on antibiotics is typically sourced from unregulated village pharmacies. Lack of trust in government run hospitals and clinics is a sharp contrast. The focus on individual behaviour change needs to take the precarity of individuals' socioeconomic circumstances into account. In another study conducted in Bangladesh, Darj, Newaz and Zaman conducted in-depth interviews with retail pharmacists in Dhaka to help understand their perceptions regarding antimicrobial resistance [5] . Participants reported self-medication, old prescriptions, inadequate regulation and readily available antibiotics as main contributors.",

The emergence of COVID-19 in 2020 has focused attention on yet another global health challenge. The difference is that the pandemic is seen as a proximate public health crisis requiring immediate action. Consequently, relatively less attention has been directed towards antimicrobial resistance and climate change which also pose urgent threats to lives and livelihoods, and in the end, may have worse global consequences. Media reports and scientific literature on COVID-19 have been prolific in 2020. A search in the Web of Science including Medline gave 78,000 'hits' on COVID-19, 38,000 on climate change and 17,000 on antibiotic or antimicrobial resistance. The results from a search in the Swedish Media Archive yielded 323,000, 11,000 and 1,100 respectively, which was even more revealing.",
