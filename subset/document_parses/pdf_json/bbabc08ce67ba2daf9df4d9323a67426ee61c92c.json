            "text": "We determined consumer preferences for traceable pork attributes in 328 consumers in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, China, based on a traceable pork attribute system composed of traceability, animal welfare, place of origin, and price attributes. Preference was studied using a Choice Experiment and Bayesian inference analysis. Results showed that the marginal utility of health welfare was lower than that of high-level traceability information and similar to that of place of origin but was higher than that of middle-level traceability information. A complementary relationship existed between dietary animal welfare and high-level traceability information and between health welfare and non-indigenous production. A substitution relationship existed between health welfare and indigenous production and between environmental animal welfare and non-indigenous production. The marginal utilities of health welfare and dietary welfare were higher than those of all price levels, and consumers accept a higher price as a result of increased production costs due to the inclusion of animal welfare information. Due to the harsh realities of COVID-19, China has recently approved the animal welfare attribute to be integrated into traceability market systems of new animal-derived food. The government should encourage manufacturers to produce diverse traceable animal-derived food not only to protect animal welfare and promote the construction of an ecological civilization, but also to develop new animal-derived food markets to satisfy different levels of consumer demand.",

            "text": "Since March 2020, COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide, resulting in incalculable losses to humans. The COVID-19 pandemic has also triggered global reflection on animal welfare protection, including the consumption of wild animals as food, and more deeply, the impact of animal health on human health. For example, according to the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs of the People's Republic of China, since the initial outbreak of African Swine Fever (ASF) in August 2018 to January 2020, China has reported 162 outbreaks and culled nearly 1.2 million infected pigs, resulting in huge economic losses to the pork industry. However, although the government has taken strict action against ASF prevention, ASF-infected pork is still present in the market, thus disturbing normal market order and threatening pork quality and safety, and consequently human health and safety. For example, the Public Security Bureau of Rui'an, Wenzhou, Zhejiang, as disclosed in the Top Ten Food Crime Cases in the First Half of 2019 issued by the Zhejiang Provincial Public Security Department, investigated and uncovered the production and sale of food that did not meet safety standards, leading to the seizure of nearly 7 tons of ASF-infected pork and an illegal profit of more than two million yuan. 1 Although ASF is not a zoonotic disease, nor is it considered infectious or harmful to humans, ASF-infected pork in the market has once again aroused widespread public concern about pork safety issues. Beltr\u00e1n-Alcrudo et al. (2017) showed that the emergence and spread of ASF is largely caused by non-standard behavior of stakeholders in the pork supply chain system, as well as poor environment and management in pig farming, so that the physical well-being of pigs cannot be guaranteed. For example, swill, domestic waste, and other pollutants are often used illegally to feed pigs and the farming environment is often unhygienic, resulting in disease and cross-infection due to bacterial proliferation.",

            "text": "In 1976, the American researcher Hughes introduced the concept of animal welfare for the first time. He defined farm animal welfare as a state of complete mental and physical health, where the animal is in harmony with its environment, advocating that humans should consider animal welfare while using animals humanely (Ren, 2006) . Gavinelli et al. (2007) pointed out that animal-derived food safety will be impacted if basic animal welfare is neglected or cannot be guaranteed, which poses long-term potential threats to human health through the food chain. Iannetti et al. (2019) showed that poor animal welfare can lead to an increase in the probability of animal diseases and their potential transmission to humans. Among infectious diseases that threaten human health, there are more than 200 infectious zoonoses. Grace et al. (2012) defined zoonosis as an infectious disease transmissible among animals and humans. Grace et al. (2011) also reported that approximately 20% of human diseases and deaths in less developed areas are caused by zoonoses. As of 2019, an average of 12 million people worldwide die from zoonoses each year (Li et al., 2019) . Iannetti et al. (2019) found that zoonoses have accounted for more than 70% of emerging infectious diseases in the past 30 years. The European Food Safety Authority (ESFA) (2019) emphasized that the susceptibility of animal-derived food to disease, including zoonoses, will increase if animal welfare cannot be guaranteed. Therefore, many European and American countries have established clear regulations regarding the protection of animal welfare in the process of farming, slaughter, and transportation from the perspective of food safety and social ethics. At present, the international community has adopted the basic definition given by the British Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC). The Farm Animal Welfare Council: Five Freedoms (2009) holds that animals should be entitled to five freedoms: i.e., freedom from hunger and thirst by ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigor (i.e., dietary welfare); freedom from discomfort by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area (i.e., environmental welfare); freedom from pain, injury, and disease by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment (i.e., health welfare); freedom to perform normal behavior by providing sufficient space, proper facilities, and adequate company of the animal's own kind (i.e., behavioral welfare); and freedom from fear and distress by ensuring conditions and treatments that avoid mental suffering (i.e., mental welfare). The World Health Organization has further stated that if animals are healthy, comfortable, fed, safe, able to express their nature freely, and free from pain, fear, and pressure, then the basic requirements of animal welfare have been met (Office International Des Epizooties (OIE), 2015). However, there is almost no legislation safeguarding animal welfare in China, and consumers know very little about animal welfare, which is the main cause of livestock meat quality and safety issues in China (Wang and Gu, 2016) .",

            "text": "Many studies have shown that food traceability systems with both ex ante quality assurance (also known as ex ante warning) and ex post traceability can help eliminate information asymmetry between producers and consumers, prevent food safety problems, and reduce the impact of food safety incidents through traceability (Opara, 2003; Kher et al., 2013; Hou et al., 2019) . Therefore, if an animal welfare information attribute with the function of ex ante quality assurance is added to pork traceability systems, it will help guide farmers to safeguard pig welfare in the farming process and prevent swine fever and other safety incidents, thereby achieving ex ante quality assurance (Alfnes et al., 2018) . Furthermore, once an incident similar to ASF-infected pork entering the market occurs, pork that fails the required standard can be recalled in a timely manner, and those responsible can be held accountable, thereby achieving ex post traceability. However, adding an animal welfare information attribute to a pork traceability system will inevitably increase the production costs of pork (Weerd and Day, 2009 ), which will certainly be reflected in market prices. Therefore, whether consumers are willing to pay a certain premium for traceable pork with an animal welfare information attribute will affect the willingness of producers to produce traceable pork with this attribute. As illustrated by the literature review below, consumers in different countries are willing to pay a certain premium for animal welfare at different levels. However, similar research remains scarce in China. Based on the actual market situation in China, we carried out a case study on consumers in Wuxi City, Jiangsu Province, which incorporated an animal welfare information attribute into a traceable pork attribute system as ex ante quality assurance information. Thus, we built a traceable pork attribute system that integrated traceability information, animal welfare, place of origin, and price attributes. In addition, a Choice Experiment was employed to collect experimental data and Bayesian inference was used for data analysis to study the perceptions and preferences of consumers for traceable pork with the animal welfare information attribute. This provides a theoretical basis for the construction of a pork traceability system that includes an animal welfare attribute in China. Ultimately, it is hoped that this will enhance pork traceability systems to improve pork safety and ensure food safety and consumer health in China.",

            "text": "As the food supply chain becomes increasingly complex, insufficient consumer knowledge on food safety information attributes can have a negative impact on the feedback loop of the supply chain (Reardon and Timmer, 2012) . Regattieri et al. (2007) showed that food traceability systems provide consumers with quality and safety information and are an essential tool to prevent food safety risks. Based on the theory of consumer demand put forward by Lancaster (1996) , the value of a commodity is created by the combination of its attributes. Therefore, the utility of consumers' consumption of food can be regarded as coming from a combination of attributes, including traceability. Food attributes can be divided into three categories, i.e., search, experience, and trust attributes (Wu et al., 2015a) . Hobbs (2004) stated that a food traceability system is designed to provide two basic functions, i.e., ex ante quality assurance and ex post traceability. The main function of ex post traceability is that substandard food can be effectively recalled through the traceability system (Ubilava and Foster, 2009) . Ex ante quality assurance presents consumers with trust attributes, such as food quality and safety, place of origin, and animal welfare, in the form of a label. This transforms the trust attribute of food safety into a search attribute, thereby reducing the time to search for desirable traceable foods (Golan et al., 2003) and playing a pre-warning role (Wu et al., 2015a) . Various studies have shown that ex ante quality assurance plays a far greater role than ex post traceability in eliminating information asymmetry (Hobbs, 2004; Loebnitz and Loose, 2015) .",

Loureiro and Umberger, 2007 adopted a Choice Experiment to study the preference of American consumers for safety attributes of meat products and found that such consumers pay more attention to products with food safety labels issued by the USDA, which prove that the meat is fresh and traceable, compared to products without safety labels. Abidoye et al. (2011) adopted the Choice-Based Conjoint approach to study American consumer preference for quality attributes of beef and concluded that such consumers are most concerned with and willing to pay a certain premium for traceability information. Bai et al. (2013) used the same method to study Chinese consumer preference for traceable milk and found that urban consumers prefer milk with traceability information. Using a Real Choice Experiment (i.e., real exchange of goods and money), Wu et al. (2015b) found that Chinese consumers have significantly heterogeneous preferences for traceable pork, and they are willing to pay a certain premium for traceability information on slaughter, processing, distribution, and sales. Furthermore, based on a Choice Experiment, Yin et al. (2017) showed that Chinese consumers prefer the traceability information attribute in the purchase of baby milk, for which they are willing to pay a certain premium. Wu et al. (2018) also studied the willingness of Chinese consumers to pay for pork with different levels of traceability information, confirming that consumers have the highest willingness to pay for complete traceability information that covers farming, slaughter, processing, distribution, and sales.",

Several basic methods can be applied to study stated preference, including Choice Experiment, Contingent Valuation, and Conjoint Analysis. According to Louviere et al.

Moreover, most earlier studies have used latent class modeling analysis tools to highlight group differences in consumers, while neglecting differences in consumers' individual preferences for different attributes. In the present study, we investigated the perceptions and preferences of consumers in Wuxi, Jiangsu Province, China, for an animal welfare attribute of traceable pork in a system composed of traceability, animal welfare, place of origin, and price attributes using a Choice Experiment and Bayesian inference analysis. Moreover, animal welfare and place of origin were classified as ex ante quality assurance attributes and traceability information was classified as an ex post traceability attribute according to Hobbs (2004) .",

            "text": "As the most frequently consumed meat in China, pork also has the most quality and safety incidents (Wu et al., 2015c) . In 2018, pork output and consumption in mainland China amounted to 54.04 and 55.398 million tons, respectively, accounting for 47.82% and 49.25% of the world's total pork output and consumption, respectively. Moreover, traceable pork is one of the earliest traceable food types in the Chinese market. Therefore, we investigated traceable pork as a case study in this paper. Given the different consumer preferences for different parts of traceable pork of the same variety, pork hindquarters, a pork part widely consumed in China (Wang et al., 2011) , were selected as the experimental product to eliminate the possible impact of nonintrinsic factors on research conclusions. For simplicity, traceable pork hindquarters are referred to as traceable pork hereinafter. The specific attribute settings are shown in Table 1 . First, the traceability information attributes and levels were set as follows. Wu et al. (2015c) found that food safety issues in China, including those of pork, are predominantly caused by human factors, such as improper behavior, failure to implement or strictly implement existing technical specifications and standard systems for food, and other violations related to production and business. From the perspective of the whole pork supply chain in China, and based on Wang et al. (2017) , feed suppliers, farmers, butchers, dealers, and retailers are important stakeholders in the pork supply chain system, and their behaviors directly affect pork quality and safety. Due to information asymmetry on pork safety attributes, it is difficult for consumers to have full access to all relevant information, which thus leads to market failure (Wu et al., 2017) . Therefore, information on traceable pork was set to cover three key links, i.e., farming, slaughter and processing, and distribution and sales. Moreover, the traceability information was displayed graphically to facilitate consumer understanding (Figure 1) . Specifically, the traceability information attributes were designed with reference to the four levels shown in Table 1 .",

Inspired by the Farm Animal Welfare Council: Five Freedoms (2009), three forms of animal welfare, i.e., dietary, environmental, and health welfare, were selected as attribute levels. In the design of the study questionnaire, the specific connotations of the three kinds of animal welfare were described clearly, and the following items were established accordingly, i.e., \"how important is providing pigs with ready access to a satisfactory diet\"; \"how important is providing pigs with a well-ventilated pigsty that allows comfortable rest and activity\"; \"how important is providing pigs with access to immediate treatment when sick\", to ensure that surveyed consumers (hereinafter referred to as participants) had a direct perception of animal welfare. Five response options were included, i.e., \"very unimportant\", \"unimportant\", \"neither important nor unimportant\", \"important\", and \"very important\". Third, the place of origin attribute was introduced into the traceable pork attribute system and separately listed in the label as an ex ante quality assurance attribute. Strictly speaking, the farming information in the traceability attribute established in this paper contains information on place of origin. However, Zhong and Wu (2018) showed that the scale of pig farming in China is still small at present and decentralized small-scale farming prevails, and thus the existing traceability system is unable to trace every small-scale pig farmer in the farming link. Although it is difficult for the place of origin information, as an independent attribute, to trace specific pig farmers, it can reflect the characteristics of the region where small-scale pig farmers are located. Moreover, it is necessary to include place of origin as an independent attribute of traceable pork in the context of China. Specifically, food safety in China is often associated with region and is closely related to regional natural environments (e.g., soil, water, and atmosphere) and social integrity. 2 For example, heavy metal pollution in rice exhibits regional distribution in China (Wu et al., 2014) . According to the Chinese definition, the place of origin of products includes regional space and geographical indication. Therefore, according to Wu et al. (2017) , place of origin was considered an independent attribute of traceable pork in this study 3 to provide consumers with producer-identifying information and thus with ex ante warning (Lim et al., 2014) . In this paper, \"LOCORIGIN\" is defined as pork produced in Wuxi, where the experiment was conducted; \"OTHORIGIN\" is defined as pork produced in Lu'an City, Anhui Province, which is commonly available in the Wuxi market according to our local survey; and \"NOORIGIN\" is defined as pork without a specified place of origin. The place of origin attribute was labeled separately, as shown in Figure 2 .",

Therefore, the integrity of food producers and operators in a region directly affects consumer expectations of food safety in that region. The term \"place of origin\" here not only indicates a geological range, but also covers consumer assessment of the integrity of food producers and operators in that region. 3 \"Place of origin\" included in the traceable information system in this study refers only to the location of pig farming. not exist in the actual market. As the site of the experiment and the selection of participants were from downtown Wuxi, consistent with those in Wu et al. (2018) , and the time interval between these experiments was short, the price of pork set by Wu et al. (2018) was adopted here (see Table 2 for specific price levels).",

The traceable pork attributes and attribute levels in Table 1 resulted in 4 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4 = 144 virtual traceable pork profiles. Generally speaking, choice tasks that take more than 30 min will exhaust consumers (Allenby and Rossi, 1989) ; as such, profiles must be limited in order to eliminate choice fatigue in participants. At the same time, based on the principle of random design, the attributes and attribute levels of traceable pork were randomly combined to ensure balanced attribute level distribution while reducing choice fatigue. The Choice Experiment was designed as follows: Firstly, the 15 main effects of the four traceable pork attributes shown in Table 1 to be studied were identified. In addition, 16 two-way interactions could be obtained between the different levels of each information attribute, which, together with the above-mentioned 15 effects, require a total of 31 degrees of freedoms. Secondly, 10 different versions of questionnaires were developed, with 10 tasks in each version. Each task contained two traceable pork profiles and a no-choice option. Thus, participants needed to compare 20 traceable pork profiles, which did not exceed the maximum quantity of profiles to avoid choice fatigue and satisfy minimum requirements for degrees of freedom. The final Choice Experiment design is shown in Figure 3 . At the end of the experiment, each participant was asked demographic questions, such as gender, age, marital status, and educational background, as well as about weekly household consumption, to investigate the possible impact of such factors on consumption preferences.",

To ensure the randomness of the respondents, every third person coming into view was selected as the respondent (Wu et al., 2015b) . It should be noted that if consumer surveys were to be carried out in a city where traceable food pilot projects have not been implemented, the investigator would need to explain relevant concepts in detail as consumers may be unfamiliar with the concept of traceable food. This would not only increase the time cost of investigation, but also the dependence of the survey results on the concept explanation of the investigator, which may lead to biased research findings. Here, the survey was carried out in Wuxi, Jiangsu. Wuxi is one of the earliest pilot cities for a traceable pork system, and thus residents have a certain understanding of traceable pork. Moreover, its per capita GDP reached 174 600 yuan in 2018, one of the highest in China and indicating a high level of economic development. The experiment was carried out in all five administrative regions of Wuxi, including Liangxi, Binhu, Huishan, Xishan, and Xinwu, with 70 participants aged 18\u223c65 recruited face-to-face in a large supermarket 5 in each administrative region. The entire Table 2 shows the demographics of the 328 participants recruited in the study. Among all participants, women accounted for 52.74% of total samples, which accords with the actual situation in China, i.e., more women are responsible for food purchases in Chinese families. In total, 74.39% of participants were aged between 18 and 35 years, 56.10% were unmarried, and 54.27% had a bachelor's degree or above; 66.77 and 93.90% of participants had no children under 18 years old and no pregnant or breast-feeding women in their families, respectively; 85.06% of participants had a good or very good health condition; 53.96% of participants had an annual household income of more than 100 000 yuan; and 43.90, 24.09, and 21.95% of participants had three, four, and five or above family members, respectively. In addition, 64.94% of participants had a household pork consumption of 500-1 500 g per week. However, it should be noted that as the sample was limited to consumers in Wuxi, it may not be representative of all cities in China. Table 3 shows the perceptions of the 328 participants regarding animal welfare in pork production. In general, participants were basically satisfied with pork quality and safety in the current market. Specifically, 66.16% of participants expressed no knowledge of animal welfare. However, 43.60, 51.52, and 77.13% of participants considered \"ready access to a satisfactory diet\", \"living in a well-ventilated pigsty that allows comfortable rest and activity\", and \"access to immediate treatment when sick\" to be very important, respectively. Moreover, 53.35 and 77.74% of participants believed that it was completely necessary to safeguard pig welfare and that safeguarding pig welfare helped improve pork quality, respectively. ",

This may be because the set price attributes had a relatively small effect on the marginal utility of traceable pork consumption compared with traceability information, animal welfare, and place of origin in the context of the four attributes and attribute levels set in the paper. Moreover, the marginal utilities of the four price levels reveal that the coefficients of the price attribute were not monotone. The marginal utility of the price attribute was not highest when the price was lowest (PRICE1 = 14 yuan/500 g), but was highest at 15.4 yuan/500 g. However, when the price was higher than 15.4 yuan/500 g, marginal utility decreased with the increase in price, consistent with the Law of Demand in classical economics, that is, consumer demand decreases with the increase in commodity prices. The marginal utility not being highest when the price of traceable pork was lowest is probably because participants paid more attention to pork quality and safety. Better pork quality and safety can be safeguarded by a higher level of traceability information, which means a higher price. Comparatively speaking, it is difficult to safeguard the quality and safety of traceable pork at the lowest price, and thus its marginal utility was lower than that at 15.4 yuan/500 g.",

In terms of interactions, the interactions HITRACE \u00d7 PHYSICAL and HEALTH \u00d7 OTHORIGIN were significant at the level of 1%, with positive coefficients. Thus, a complementary relationship existed between HITRACE and PHYSICAL and between HEALTH and OTHORIGIN. When the label only shows dietary welfare of pigs, that is, information on food and drinking water in the farming process, the addition of high-level traceability information that covers farming, slaughter and processing, and distribution and sales as a supplement can reduce consumer concerns about the risk of pork. Thus, there is a complementary relationship between HITRACE and PHYSICAL. When the label shows that traceable pork is nonindigenous, pigs cannot be guaranteed treatment when they are sick in the farming process, so the health welfare label is also required to ensure the safety of such pork. Thus, there is also a complementary relationship between HEALTH and OTHORIGIN. In contrast, the HEALTH \u00d7 LOCORIGIN interaction was significant at the 5% level, with a negative coefficient. This suggests that the indigenous label guarantees access to medical treatment, which is the information contained in the health welfare label, resulting in a strong relationship between HEALTH and LOCORIGIN. Lastly, the ENVIR \u00d7 OTHORIGIN interaction was significant at the 1% level, with a negative coefficient, indicating that a substitutional relationship exists between ENVIR and OTHORIGIN. The ex ante risk assessment carried out by participants on traceable pork based on the non-indigenous label already covered information about the habitat environment of pigs in the farming process, so OTHORIGIN can substitute ENVIR.",

            "text": "Firstly, when asked directly, 77.74% of participants claimed that safeguarding pig welfare was helpful or very helpful for improving pork quality and safety. The Choice Experiment results also showed that although the marginal utility of health welfare was lower than that of high-level traceability information, it was similar to that of place of origin, and higher than that of middle-level traceability information and other attribute levels. Consumer preference for health welfare was lower than that for traceability information. This may be due to their perceptions of higher traceability information than of health welfare as perception determines behavior. The calculation results showed that the relative importance of animal welfare to consumers was higher than that of place of origin among traceable pork attributes with the function of ex ante quality assurance. Therefore, including the animal welfare attribute in the form of a label may better meet consumer demand for pork safety and quality information than including the place of origin attribute. This conclusion accords with that of Yuta et al. (2018) , i.e., most consumers prefer to purchase animalderived food with an animal welfare label. This is because the animal welfare label provides more information than the place of origin label. For example, the health welfare attribute reflects information on disease treatment in the farming process of pigs, which is more helpful for consumers to determine pork quality and safety.",

            "text": "Secondly, we found a complementary relationship between high-level traceability information and dietary welfare. This finding suggests that the risk of pork with an animal welfare label only is still uncontrollable, and traceability information that covers farming, slaughter and processing, and distribution and sales should be included as a supplement. Therefore, to ensure the function of the animal welfare label, a label system that combines the traceability information attribute, which enables ex post traceability, and the animal welfare attribute, which enables ex ante quality assurance, may better meet market demand. This conclusion is consistent with that of Wu et al. (2015b) . This is because complete traceability information covering farming, slaughter and processing, and distribution and sales ensures that sub-standard food can be effectively recalled, thereby safeguarding pork safety and quality. Thirdly, although the importance of the animal welfare information attribute was lower than that of the price attribute, the marginal utilities of health welfare and dietary welfare were higher than those of all price levels. This indicates that consumers accept a higher price as a result of increased production costs due to the inclusion of animal welfare information. This is mainly because consumers are highly concerned about food safety. This conclusion accords with that of previous studies in other countries. For example, Yuta et al. (2018) reported that nearly 90% of Japanese consumers are willing to pay a certain premium for beef with an animal welfare label. Spain et al. (2018) found that American consumers are willing to pay a premium of 0.79 US dollars (32%) for eggs with animal welfare information. Thus, consumer demand already exists for the setting of an animal welfare attribute for traceable animal-derived food in the context that consumers are highly concerned about the safety of animal-derived food in China. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, China has recently approved the integration of an animal welfare attribute into traceability market systems of new animal-derived foods. The government should encourage manufacturers to produce diverse traceable animalderived food not only to protect animal welfare and promote the construction of an ecological civilization, but also to develop new animal-derived food markets to satisfy different levels of consumer demand.",
