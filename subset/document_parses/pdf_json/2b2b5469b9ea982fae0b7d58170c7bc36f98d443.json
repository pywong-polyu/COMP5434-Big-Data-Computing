Voluntary buyouts, where governments acquire flooddamaged properties and return the sites to open space, have been the primary form of federally funded retreat in the USA to date. However, little attention has been paid to the cost structure of buyout projects. Using a transaction cost framework, we analyze the costs of activities that comprise floodplain buyouts. Federal data do not distinguish transaction costs, but they do suggest that the cost of purchasing properties often accounts for 80% or less of total project costs. Through a systematic review (n = 1103 publications) and an analysis of government budgets (across n = 859 jurisdiction-years), we find limited sources with relevant cost information, none of which reports transaction costs. The absence of activity-level cost data inhibits more targeted policy reform to support community-driven and efficient buyout programs. Better data collection and reporting can inform more impactful and equitable buyout policy.",

This trend, combined with population growth patterns and a variety of negative predicted effects of climate change (Wing et al. 2018) , has contributed to a growing consensus that managed retreat will be a necessary component of flood mitigation strategies going forward (Reidmiller et al. 2018) . To date, floodplain buyouts 1 have constituted the primary federally funded approach to managed retreat in the USA (Dyckman et al. 2014) . In buyout programs, governments purchase flood-prone properties from willing sellers, usually restoring the land to some sort of open space. Property owners receive compensation for their flood-damaged homes, while the removal of structures from the floodplain reduces future flood damages and emergency response burdens Siders 2013a) .",

While both federal agencies (e.g., FEMA 2013; FEMA 2021a) and academic researchers (e.g., Tate et al. 2016; Nelson and Camp 2020) have undertaken benefit-cost studies, these studies often conflate property purchase costs with total project costs, omit certain cost categories, or overlook the distribution of costs among actors. These data gaps are problematic for several reasons. First, non-purchase costs associated with buyouts may be large due to the information-sharing, planning, and negotiation involved (Meyer et al. 2012 ). An analysis of transfer of development rights (TDR) programs, which parallel floodplain buyouts in that both entail the transfer of real property rights, found that meeting administrative requirements, holding public meetings, finalizing contracts, and other non-purchase costs accounted for between 13 and 21% of total costs (Shahab et al. 2018) .",

We begin by briefly covering the existing federal funding structures for floodplain buyout projects, and then define a typology to classify costs of buyout activities as production costs, transaction costs, or transaction costs imposed by federal policy. We then explore three sources of data to quantify the activity-level costs incurred in a typical buyout project in the USA: administrative records of FEMA-funded hazard mitigation projects; the peer-reviewed and gray literatures; and budget documents from a sample of local, county, and state governments that have implemented floodplain buyouts. 1 We use the term \"buyout\" throughout this paper to refer both to acquisition projects where property owners are offered pre-flood fair market values (FMVs) and acquisition projects where property owners are offered postflood FMVs. We do not distinguish between projects that prohibit future development and those that allow redevelopment. In contrast, HUD distinguishes between these two models, referring to the former as a \"buyout\" and the latter as an \"acquisition\"; FEMA only funds the former, which it refers to as an \"acquisition and demolition\" project (HUD 2019; FEMA 2015) . Because FEMA funding accounts for such a significant share of buyout funding (Mach et al. 2019; Peterson et al. 2020) , buyout properties that are redeveloped are relatively uncommon.",

These programs, which fund buyouts in addition to other hazard mitigation and disaster recovery efforts, have supported floodplain buyouts for the past three decades (FEMA 2018) . Most federal buyout funds require a 25% non-federal cost match, whereby states, local governments, or other entities (e.g., foundations [e.g., UNC CRC 2018], property owners [e.g., Kummerer 2019]) cover a portion of buyout costs.

            "text": "A typical FEMA-funded HMGP buyout project is illustrated in Fig. 1 . Under this program, states are the primary recipients for hazard mitigation funding. States work with local governments to compile an application of mitigation-eligible properties, and then send a single, statewide application to FEMA. If awarded, states then take these funds and distribute them to local governments, which interface with property owners and conduct-or contract out-many of the buyout implementation activities. HUD's CDBG-DR program follows a similar general structure wherein federal funds are awarded to states, which often then subgrant funds to local governments for implementation (HUD 2013). As depicted by Weber and Moore (2019; Fig. 1 ), the typical buyout project involves multiple actors engaged in a complex series of sequenced activities. This program structure, which is further complicated by a reactive and irregular cycle of buyout funding (funding is allocated in the wake of major disasters; Martin et al. 2019) , may create inefficiencies, including (1) burdensome and overlapping application, reporting, and project management processes between different levels of government and across federal funding agencies (Greer and Binder 2017; Mach et al. 2019; US GAO 2021; Kick et al. 2011);  (2) fractured authority across and within local, state, and federal agencies, leading to conflicting guidance and interpretations of project requirements (Fraser et al. 2003; Greer and Binder 2017; Mach et al. 2019; Kick et al. 2011);  (3) a need for high levels of staff capacity at the local level (Mach et al. 2019; US GAO 2021; Martin et al. 2019) , despite the fact that many buyout projects, and the communities implementing them, are fairly small; and (4) marginal economies of scale as a result of municipal implementation of projects, which often acquire only a single property (the median and mean FEMA-funded buyout projects acquire only three and eleven properties, respectively [FEMA 2020b]).",

Thus, the delay between a flooding event and closings on participants' properties reduces the number of acquired properties, leaving residents at risk of future flooding. Furthermore, delays can lead to residents sustaining additional, subsequent flooding while waiting for buyout offers associated with the initial event, producing compounding health and quality of life concerns. For those residents who do hold out, the length of the buyout process creates an extended period of uncertainty and liminality. Either residents must continue to live in their flood-damaged properties in substandard and potentially unsafe conditions or they must find temporary alternative housing, awaiting a buyout offer that will enable them to move to more permanent housing (Baker et al. 2018 ). According to a survey conducted a year after Hurricane Harvey struck Texas, 19% of all respondents-and 27% of Hispanic respondents and those with incomes under 200% of the poverty line-reported that their flood-damaged homes remained unsafe to live in (Hamel et al. 2018) .",

However, because our interest is in transaction costs produced by federal buyout policy, not those resulting from other institutions that create market friction (e.g., requirements for a notary to witness and sign a deed transfer), we classify activities as incurring either \"buyout transaction costs\"-costs resulting from federal funding requirements; general transaction costs-those costs, such as closing costs, that would not occur given a frictionless market, but that would occur even if the buyout were not funded with federal dollars; and production costs-those costs that would occur even in a frictionless market. In Fig. 2 , we present the application of this approach to the various buyout activities identified by Weber and Moore (2019) .",

For the same reason, the various reporting, oversight, and project closeout activities at the local, state, and federal levels also constitute buyout transaction costs. Indeed, the first costs that are not buyout transaction costs do not occur on average, according to Weber and Moore (2019) , until between three and four years after the precipitating flood event, and result from conducting property appraisals (general transaction cost), buying and selling the property (general transaction cost), and demolishing any structures on the property (production cost). Although not enumerated in Fig. 2 , this phase also frequently entails environmental assessments-e.g., for asbestos-and remediation, as well as historical preservation reviews. These activities constitute general transaction costs because each would likely be necessary even if there were no federal funding requirements; in order to demolish any structures, historical and environmental reviews and remediation would likely be required by local, state, or federal law, while appraisal and the actual sale of the property are processes familiar to anyone who has ever purchased property. However, because implementing governments have to arrange for contracts with external firms to conduct these tasks (appraisals, environmental reviews, demolition), for example, by putting these tasks out to bid, there are also buyout transaction costs incurred at this stage of a project.

Reprinted and adapted with permission from Weber and Moore (2019) Lastly, site maintenance differs from other activities listed in Fig. 2 in that it is not a requisite part of a buyout project, but rather a function of post-buyout land use as determined by the local government (Zavar and Hagelman 2016) . For example, a local government might devote no resources to site maintenance, might develop and maintain a site as a public park, or might have volunteers maintain the property. As such, we omit site maintenance from our classification of buyout activity costs, though in subsequent sections of the paper we include reports of site maintenance costs in order to develop a more comprehensive understanding of all buyout-related costs.",

Approximately 16% of projects (n = 170) spent two-thirds or less of their funds on \"Actual Amount Paid\" activities (see Fig. 3 ). As evidenced above and shown in Fig. 3 , there are significant issues with data quality that leave us hesitant to draw any conclusions from these results. For example, FEMA inconsistently calculates its \"Actual Amount Paid\" variable, which does not necessarily equal the market value of the property: this value reflects an unknown combination of the amount paid to the property owner by FEMA, previous disaster aid received, and related costs, such as those for appraisals, closing, and demolition. In addition, many projects (n = 101; 10%) had \"Actual Amount Paid\" values that exceeded their total project costs; these projects are shown in Fig. 3 as having percent \"Actual Amount Paid\" costs greater than 100%. While we cannot explain these values, this likely points to poor data quality control or incomplete reporting. These data are also limited in that they do not capture costs incurred at the federal level, nor those incurred by individual homeowners, e.g., the time spent determining one's eligibility or completing program paperwork. They also do not allow us to break down broad cost categories into more relevant activity-level costs.",

Our resulting sample, shown in Fig. 5 , comprised 98 unique municipalities, 81 unique counties, and 25 unique states.

For one, FEMA refers to buyouts as \"acquisition/demolition\" projects, which may contribute to the usage of \"buy and demolish,\" \"purchase and demolition,\" and similar terms as substitutes when referring to the myriad activities comprising a buyout. Furthermore, grant awards cover more than just the discrete costs associated with acquisition and demolition, such as staff costs for program implementation, suggesting that such phrasing may refer to total project funding as opposed to merely property purchase prices and demolition costs.

The lack of documentation may result because many local governments only sporadically engage in buyouts; if local officials have never implemented a buyout project before and do not expect to repeat the process in the future, there is little reason to capture any of the time or activity-level costs. There are also no requirements or incentives to do so by state or federal agencies-nor even guidance and tools to support such accounting-and logging hours and costs may be tedious. The result is that, in both budgets and the scholarly literature, grant awards and property purchase prices are widely reported, while other, less tangible project costs are not even mentioned. Yet, property purchase price information provides little basis for future projects to learn from and improve on past experience.",

It also ignores the costs imposed on prospective project participants, who have to invest time to learn about the opportunity, complete paperwork, and wait-oftentimes for years-to receive a buyout offer. These buyout transaction costs may have implications for the equity of existing buyout structures: for example, prospective participants with fewer resources or less formal education may have to expend more time and money to navigate buyout processes than their counterparts and may be more likely to find these processes prohibitive to actually participating in a buyout.",

Some activities, such as designing the buyout project along with the community and communicating frequently with property owners, are crucial to the outcomes of buyout projects. These activities should be supported to encourage more transparent and equitable buyout projects (Siders 2018) . By contrast, other non-purchase activities may create delays without contributing significantly to enhancing participant and program outcomes. Without activity-level data, it is impossible to identify where transaction costs can be eliminated and where additional funding may be needed. Activity cost data could support other aspects of program reform as well: for example, data from a range of projects would enable evaluators to examine whether there are economies of scale for projects acquiring many properties, which might in turn inform efforts to consolidate buyout project implementation at the county level when properties are scattered across multiple municipalities.",

A simple budgeting tool that aligns with the activities identified in Fig. 2 could be integrated into existing project reporting processes for both FEMA-and HUD-funded buyouts. Over time, such data would allow for comparison of buyouts across funding mechanisms, support transaction cost evaluations of projects, and enable governments prospectively considering buyouts to better plan and budget for their estimated expenses. Until reporting standardizes and aggregates these data, future research might seek to systematically quantify the costs of the various activities that comprise typical floodplain buyout projects, for example, through primary data collection from individuals engaged in funding and implementing buyouts.",

Substantial transaction costs may be preventing local governments with less capacity from engaging in buyout programs at all (Mach et al. 2019) , and reducing those barriers could open up access to a broader population. Several jurisdictions have already instituted independently funded buyout programs to increase their own flexibility. For example, New Jersey's stateoperated Blue Acres program blends funding from HMGP, CDBG, state legislative appropriations, and the US Department of Agriculture's Natural Resources Conservation Service to conduct buyouts more quickly and strategically than is typical (Weber 2019a; NJ Department of Environmental Protection 2015) . Charlotte-Mecklenburg (NC) Stormwater Services (SWS) operates a locally funded buyout program that acquires properties within its joint city-county jurisdiction in roughly six months after flooding. The program was developed in response to the length of FEMA-funded buyouts, which led to higher program attrition and costs, as buyout offers would have to pay for repairs and updates made in the intervening years after the precipitating flood event. Notably, Charlotte-Mecklenburg's approach identifies potential buyout properties before the flood so that SWS can execute acquisitions more quickly when flooding does occur (Weber 2019b) .",

First, while our budget analysis examined a broad set of municipal, county, and state budgets, we did not examine the budgets of other entities involved in administering floodplain buyouts, such as flood control districts. We focused on jurisdictions' annual budgets because these are almost universally required, although some jurisdictions' budgets (26%) were nonetheless unavailable online. Future research might evaluate finer grained sources of financial data, such as grant awards, government contracting records, or the budgets of more specialized units, e.g., flood control districts or individual government departments. However, these sources are much less likely to be universally available than were annual government budgets, limiting the generalizability of any results. Second, given that federal funding streams uniquely shape how buyout projects are implemented in the USA, we did not examine literature or other data sources relating to buyouts conducted in other countries. While our results may be relevant to other countries' work to design and implement more efficient and equitable buyout programs, efforts to reform US buyout programs might also benefit from an extension of this transaction cost analysis to buyout projects conducted internationally. Lastly, the sample for our budget analysis was drawn from FEMA records and thus did not necessarily include budget-years for jurisdictions that implemented buyouts without any FEMA funding. This was in part intentional, given that our primary focus in this paper was the application of activity cost data to reforming federally funded buyouts. However, activity cost data from buyouts funded without federal assistance may be valuable in helping to characterize and learn from alternate approaches to implementing buyouts.",

These improvements will help property owners relocate more speedily, and cost savings and other efficiency gains will mean more resources can be devoted to core buyout activities that maximize participants' well-being and promote more equitable outcomes.
