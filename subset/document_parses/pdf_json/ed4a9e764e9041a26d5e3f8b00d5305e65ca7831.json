The purpose of this work is to illustrate the innovative method for the certification and protection of the production phases of the DOP food chain and specifically the Mozzarella DOP of Gioia del Colle produced by the company Capurso Azienda Casearia Srl. This innovative approach consists of several phases that will be described in detail in the following paper. Besides, the idea of the introduction of Blockchain technology in an industry like this is an important step. This technology, associated with more accurate and intelligent management of the data acquisition process (Big data approach), optimizes the productivity of small businesses such as the dairy company. Blockchain technology guarantees security in the management of large amounts of data as never before possible, an innovative and experimental approach that makes the entire path of the production chain more controlled and optimized (Giacalone et al. International workshop on fuzzy logic and applications. Springer, Cham, pp. 218-225, 2016).",

This approach is generally used for all improvement activities of a particular type of process. The DMAIC already contains within its acronym the definition of the same, in fact, if the acronym is broken down it is possible to derive the definition as well as the phases that represent it. This process is composed by five phases: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, and Control (De Mast and Lokkerbol 2012) . The five stages are strongly linked to each other and each of them describes an important step for quality management aimed at improving, optimizing, and stabilizing a particular organization process. The first phase, or \"Define\", aims to identify a specific problem to be solved as well as the resources needed to achieve the goal. The second act, \"Measure\", has the specific task of collecting information that can then be used as a reference to measure subsequent improvements; the \"Analyze\" phase analyzes the causes and origins of a given problem. The last two phases \"Improve\" and \"Control\" respectively have the objective of identifying and implementing a solution to the problem and monitoring improvements to be maintained over time. As anticipated, DMAIC is used within the Six Sigma, which is a quality management program, based on effective control and having the purpose of making any qualitative improvement to a product or service (Pyzdek and Keller 2003) .",
