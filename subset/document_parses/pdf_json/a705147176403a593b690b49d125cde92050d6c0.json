Data from scRNA-seq suggest that men have a higher amount of ACE2-expressing pulmonary alveolar type II cells than women. Sex-based immunological differences exist, with cytokines associated with cytokine release syndrome preferentially expressed in men, and those associated with defense and recovery from viral infection preferentially expressed in women. ScRNA-seq data of the prostate and testis revealed that these two organs might be potential targets for SARS-CoV-2 infection in the male population. The expression of androgen receptor (AR) is positively correlated with ACE2, and there is evidence that AR may directly regulate the expression of ACE2.",

The management of COVID-19 has become a current emergency public health event, which has attracted increasing attention. Early recognition, testing and isolation are the effective response to curb transmissions. 1, 2 Health security capacities improving, global collaboration in relation to COVID-19 and current travel restrictions are necessary for global epidemic control. 3, 4 Around 6.4-24.9% of patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 may progress to severe and even fatal acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), 5-26.1% of patients need treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU), and the fatality rate of patients can reach 1.4-7.2%. [5] [6] [7] [8] Older age, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, chronic comorbidities were the risk factors associated with the patients of the 2019-nCoV infection 9, 10 . However, whether the sex difference is related to the risk factors for infection, severity, and mortality of COVID-19 is still lacking a comprehensive analysis based on the integration of new studies. 11 Although some cases report support for sex differences to be associated with the onset and prognosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, 12 some studies do not support this observation. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports on 44672 confirmed cases showing that sex differences may be a risk factor for mortality, but there is no sex differences in morbidity. 7 Even more confirmed cases of female than male in South Korea are reported by the Korean Society of Infectious Diseases. 13 Therefore, a meta-analysis was performed to reveal the correlation between sex differences and the prevalence, severity and mortality of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

Thirty-nine studies involving 77932 patients were assessed in the comparison of the sex differences in patient composition. Part of the reported cases are concentrated in Wuhan, China, but from different hospitals. Overall, male accounted for 53.3% of all patients and female accounted for 46.7% (41510, 36408 respectively). Among the patients included, the number of males was higher than that of females (39 studies; 77932 patients; Odds = 1.12), especially in the Chinese population (34 studies; 50488 patients; Odds = 1.13). Because the sex-specific numbers of the general population in the investigated areas are typically not provided, a meta-analysis for sex-specific incidence or morbidity is not feasible. We therefore provided an albatross plot for visualization of the comparison of the male proportion in each study with 0.5 ( Figure 2A ). It can be observed from the albatross plot that studies with large sample sizes and low p values tend to report a male proportion over 0.5. Twenty-one studies (3905 patients) reported the severe cases according to the setting standards mentioned above. Regarding the severe case rate ( Figure 2B ), the male group exhibited a prominently increased severity rate compared with the female group (21 studies; 3905 patients; OR = 1.63; 95% Cl = 1.28-2.06, P=0.000). Subgroup meta-analysis suggested that in patients with average age > 50 yr, the male had significantly higher severity rate than female (OR = 1.94; 95% Cl = 1.16-3.26, P=0.000). However, in patients with average age < 50 yr, the male group only exhibited a marginally increased severity rate compared with the female group (OR = 1.45; 95% Cl = 1.07-1.96, P=0.006, Figure 2C ). A total of 8 studies included information of smoking history with available information about percentage of severe cases. 8, 10, 39, 43, 44, 55, 58, 60 With the percentage of positive smoking history ranged from 5.6% to 23.3%. A total of only 252 cases with smoking history were reported against the study outcome. We consider it would be inappropriate to pool the results for stratified analysis based on the limited cases. In the 39 studies mentioned above, a total of 8 studies (50936 patients) provided mortality information. The pooled estimate of OR of mortality for male group compared with the female group indicated significant survival risk for male (8 studies; 49869 patients; OR = 1.71; 95% CI = 1.51-1.93, P=0.000) ( Figure 2D ).",

We hypothesized that AR could also directly regulate ACE2 expression. At the single-cell level, we found a positive correlation between TMPRSS2 and ACE2 expression ( Figure 5A , Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.713). To verify this expression pattern across the spectrum of human tissues, we tested the correlation of expression level of AR and ACE2/TMPRSS2 in the TCGA PANCAN dataset ( Figure 5B ). We found that expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 is positively correlated with AR, irrespective of tissue types. We then utilized publicly available microarray datasets to investigate the impact of chemical or surgical castration, which lowers the level of androgens, on the expression level of these two genes. Unsurprisingly, both in vitro and in vivo studies ( Figure 5C -D) demonstrated that castration leads to the decline of ACE2 and TMPRSS2, which could be reversed through androgen supplementation. To understand the mechanism underpinning the positive correlation between AR and ACE2, we analyzed publicly available ChIP-seq datasets and found that, around 4000 bp upstream of ACE2 transcription start site (TSS), there is overlap between AR ChIP-seq peaks and H3K4me1/H3K27ac ChIPseq peaks (Supplementary Figure S5-6) , indicating that AR likely binds to the enhancer regions and promotes the expression of ACE2.",

Our pooled results demonstrated that gender played a prone role in COVID-19 infection. Concretely, male patients exhibited higher morbidity, incidence of severe disease and mortality compared with female patients. Of the 77992 patients with COVID-19 included in our study, 53.3% were men, indicating that men were more likely to be infected with sarscov-2 than women. Unanimously, in the analysis of 1755 SARS cases by Karlberg et al. 67 the mortality rate of men was significantly higher than that of women (21.9% vs 13.2%, P < 0.0001). Leung et al, 68 showed that in SARS patients, men were more likely to experience adverse events. It is worth noting that there is no clear evidence of sex differences in the prognosis of influenza. [69] [70] [71] The sex differences of morbidity and prognosis is believed as a characteristic of coronavirus infection. In addition, we discovered that male patients with age > 50 yr were associated with a greater risk of progressing to severe cases or ICU cases. Interestingly, the epidemiological data from the 2002-2003 SARS epidemic and recent MERS also indicated that there might be sex and age-dependent differences in disease outcomes. According to the epidemiology analysis of SARS in the 2003 Hong Kong epidemic, both increasing age and male sex were associated with a greater risk for death. 68 Channappanavar et al. infected mice with SARS-CoV and demonstrated that male mice were more susceptible to SARS-CoV infection compared to age matched females. Furthermore, the degree of sex-bias to SARS-CoV infection in middle-aged mice was more pronounced compared to young mice. 72 Together, these data suggested that older male patients with COVID-19 should get more attention and prepared for ICU treatment when they were still mild cases.",

Some studies have shown that different outcomes between males and females may pertain to the possibility that estrogen protects women from worse clinical outcomes during SARS-CoV infection. 67, 73 In a risk factor analysis of patients with COVID-19, smoking history was identified as a risk factor for disease progression. 43 It was illustrated that the expression of ACE2 is significantly higher in the lungs of smokers, which might be the reason for higher percentage of sever cases in smokers. Notably, the smoking rate of men is typically much higher than that of women. 12 This seems to explain the results theoretically, however, there was only a small proportion of cases with smoking history and thus the influence of smoking on sexual differences seems to be weak. Another possible explanation is the different levels of ACE2 expression.",

Studies have shown that men had higher levels of circulating ACE2 than women and patients with diabetes or cardiovascular disease. 78 Therefore, due to the high expression of ACE2, male patients may be more likely to develop severe symptoms and die of SARS-CoV-2. In addition to that, spike protein promotes the attachment and entry of coronavirus into target cells by binding to its cellular receptor. 79 Recent studies have confirmed that in COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 also relies on the priming of spike protein by TMPRSS2 to enter target cells. Inhibitors of TMPRSS2, as a clinical option, can block virus entry. 14 However, the mechanisms need further elucidation.",

            "text": "LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 decreased significantly after treatment with the AR inhibitor bicalutamide. Similarly, in the prostate of castrated mice, the expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 decreased significantly, and their expression was up-regulated after supplementation with androgen. These evidences suggest that anti-AR may be a new strategy for treating males with SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, further research is needed to confirm this speculation. A great quantity of patients with severe COVID-19 infection have experienced cytokine release syndromes, or \"cytokine storms\". 60 Previous cases of infectious diseases such as SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola virus infectionshave also demonstrated that cytokine storms can trigger the immune system to attack the body violently, which is a momentous cause of acute respiratory distress syndrome and multiple organ failure. 80-82 A previous study demonstrated that there was a positive correlation between the severity of pneumonia and the cytokine storm and inflammatory response caused by intravascular virus. 83,84 IL-6 is the main proinflammatory factor causing cytokine storm, which can significantly damage organ function, as well as IL-7, IL-16 and IL-18.45,85,86  Our study observed that the expression levels of Il-6ST, IL-7, IL-16 and IL-18 in male were significantly higher than that in female. These findings and observations may help to explain why the risk of severe events in male is strikingly higher than in female.Our data revealed that CCL14, CCL21, and CCL23 (important pro-inflammatory factors) have increased expression in the lungs of male patients with COVID-19, which may promote COVID-19-related cytokine storms. In flu disease, type I interferon-mediated production of the CCL2 recruits inflammatory dendritic cells (IDCs) to the tracheal epithelium, which is conducive to virus control.87  Previous studies have shown that CCL3, CCL4 can inhibit HIV-1 from entering CD4 T cells and play a protective role. 88 CXCL16, mainly located in the respiratory epithelium, is a ligand for CXCR6 playing an important role in homeostasis of Resident memory T cells in the respiratory tract.89  In our study, the expressions of CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CXCL16 were lower in male patients than female patients, which may aggravate the condition of male COVID-19 patients to a certain extent. BAFF (gene name Tnfsf13b) is closely related to B-cell activation and adaptive humoral immune response. BAFF is elevated in lung tissue of COPD patients and can cause lung inflammation and injury. 90 Therefore, our data show that BAFF expression is increased in male COVID-19 patients, which may worsen the condition.Admittedly, there remain certain shortages in our systematic review. First of all, only thirty-nine studies were incorporated which focused on the morbidity, severity and mortality of COVID-19 infection. These studies are mostly from China. Up to March 28, 2020, more than 600,000 cases have been reported worldwide. Most of aforementioned cases have not been covered and published in the available studies. With an intensified body of case studies being reported, more large population and superior quality studies could be embedded to consolidate our findings. Secondly, our systematic review was consisted of 39 individual studies with various contexts, which may induce insufficient statistical availability and dispersive results to a lesser extent. Third, in rare cases, there is no way to determine which reports are repeated. there may be some overlap in patients among different studies, especially most of the included Chinese studies were summarized in the national report. 7 However, in the sensitivity analysis, the results were still consistent after omitting the Chinese national report in the analysis (Figure 4A). As for the heterogeneity of gender composition analysis, it may be attributed to a different baseline ratio of male and female in each region. There may be sex differences in the susceptibility and diseases progression of patients with COVID-19. The clinical symptoms of male are more serious than those of women, and the outcome of hospitalization is less favorable. From the results of integrated bioinformatic analyses, it can be postulated that androgen deprivation therapy, frequently adopted in the treatment of prostate cancer, could potentially exert a protective and therapeutic effect against the coronavirus. Nevertheless, the findings of the study should be interpreted with caution.

Cells contained over 200 expressed genes and mitochondria UMI rate below 20% passed the cell quality filtering and mitochondria genes were removed in the expression table. Seurat package (version: 2.3.4, https://satijalab.org/seurat/) was used for cell normalization and regression based on the expression table according to the UMI counts of each sample and percent of mitochondria rate to obtain the scaled data. PCA was constructed based on the scaled data with top2000 high variable genes and top 10 principals of 20 PCs were used for tSNE construction and UMAP construction. Utilizing graph-based cluster method, we acquired the unsupervised cell cluster result based the PCA top 10 principal and we calculated the marker genes by FindAllMarkers function with wilcox rank sum test algorithm under following criteria:1. lnFC > 0.25; 2. P value<0.05; 3. min.pct>0.1.
