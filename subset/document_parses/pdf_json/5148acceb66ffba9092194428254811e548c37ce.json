            "text": "This paper presents a systematic review on extrusion additive manufacturing (EAM), with focus on the technological development of screw-assisted systems that can be fed directly with granulated materials. Screw-assisted EAM has gained importance as an enabling technology to expand the range of 3D printing materials, reduce costs associated with feedstock fabrication, and increase the material deposition rate compared to traditional fused filament fabrication (FFF). Many experimental printheads and commercial systems that use some screw-processing mechanism can be found in the literature, but the design diversity and lack of standard terminology make it difficult to determine the most suitable solutions for a given material or application field. Besides, the few previous reviews have offered only a glimpse into the topic, without an in-depth analysis about the design of the extruders and associated capabilities. A systematic procedure was devised to identify the screw-assisted EAM systems that can print directly from granulated materials, resulting in 61 articles describing different pieces of equipment that were categorized as experimental printheads and commercial systems, for small-and large-scale applications. After describing their main characteristics, the most significant extruder modifications were discussed with reference to the materials processed and performance requirements. In the end, a general workflow for the development of 3D printers based on screw extrusion was proposed. This review intends to provide information about the state-of-the-art screw-assisted EAM and help the academy to identify further research opportunities in the field.",

In fact, the utilization of a screw mechanism with continuous feeding of granulated materials, similarly to industrial polymer extruders, is particularly interesting to allow a more precise control over the extrusion process, associated with improved capacity to generate pressure, homogenize the molten material, and allow some level of mixing.",

However, few paragraphs were dedicated to discuss the screw-assisted systems, which were mostly used due to the viscosity of the highly filled materials processed. A review on 3D printing of engineering thermoplastics, which usually require high processing temperatures, has also described the use of screw-assisted systems [8] . However, most of the described machine modifications focused on the temperature of the build environment temperature, which should be controlled to help softening the material, reduce thermal gradients in the part and avoid damage of sensitive components. Zhang et al. [6] mentioned the screw-assisted printheads as important improvements of EAM, which could favor 3D printing with innovative materials (e.g., micro-or nano-reinforced polymers), and lead to faster and more precise deposition.",

Figure 1 presents a flowchart of the search process, showing the resulting number of papers after each step. From the 251 articles found for the two search strings, 45 duplicates were excluded and 53 met the three inclusion criteria. After full reading, 37 articles found in the systematic search and 17 crossed references were qualified to compose the repository. Besides, 7 articles previously known by the authors that described screw-assisted EAM systems still uncovered by the search were also added to the repository, totalizing 61 articles. Since this study aims to structure the knowledge about screw-assisted 3D printers that use granulated materials, the equipment explored in the different publications are listed in Table 2 . Experimental machines are referenced by the name of the first author, while commercial systems are denoted by the models' name. All publications related to each table entry are indicated by the numbers in brackets. Table 2 also shows the countries that contributed to the research with each system, as well as the data used to classify the equipment into small-and large-scale systems.

As will be shown in Section 4, many new experimental systems for both smalland large-scale applications appeared in the period from 2014 to 2018 [15-29, 32, 34, 35, 37] , which can be related to the high number of publications in the same period. Although the scientific production in the last 2 years decreased, a crescent share of the research was carried out with commercial systems [48, 49, 51, 53, 54, 65-69, 71-73, 75] , indicating the consolidation of screw-assisted EAM in the market.",

The most innovative system incorporated a first plasticating stage followed by an auger screw for controlled deposition [59] . Besides, the first commercial system (BAAM\u00ae [63] ) was introduced in the period. New large-scale systems were last introduced in 2018, with two commercial machines (Gigabot X\u00ae [70] , Super Discovery\u00ae [75] ) and no significant modifications in terms of extruder design.

Besides, the printhead assembly moved in the three directions thanks to a custom-made desktop positioning system, while the deposition surface was kept fixed [12] . The system's performance was initially assessed with relation to the processing temperature, nozzle geometry, and deposition velocity using ceramic materials with different granulometry. According to the authors, some level of agglomeration as well as air entrapment was observed within the deposited structures [12] .

Biocomposites were also explored by Singamneni et al. [32, 33] using their equipment, but in this case, the materials were previously mixed and cut into pellets. Nozzles with increased diameter were used to avoid material clogging. Tseng et al. [34] designed their printhead to process pellets of highly viscous polymers, and added infrared (IR) heaters near the deposition nozzle to prevent delamination and warping when printing. The equipment designed by Jackson et al. [24] was very simple and both the auger screw and housing could be fabricated in acrylic resin by a stereolithography process, since the intended processing temperature for the petroleum-based pellets was relatively low. Alexandre et al. [41] replaced the FFF printhead of a lowcost 3D printer with a do-it-yourself screw-extruder kit, marketed by a recently founded company. The equipment was tested with virgin and recycled polymer pellets, as well as shredded plastic waste. The printhead developed by Wang et al. [44] to process biopolymer pellets has no significant innovations, and the authors did not provide a detailed description of its dimensions. The main novelty is that the authors used a mandrel rotating around the x-axis as the deposition surface. Tests were performed to calibrate the thickness of the extruded fibers in function of the rotation speed of screw and mandrel, as well as the printhead travel speed.",

Besides biopolymer pellets, polymer blends previously prepared and cut as pellets were also tested [36] . Boyle et al.

A similar printhead using a drill bit was developed by Kim, Lee [42] , which was then integrated into a low-cost 3D printer.

The focus of their work was determining the influence of the process parameters on the resulting height and width of the deposited material. An online control routine was implemented to correct the positioning of the robotic arm based on data acquired during material deposition. In a subsequent work, an online re-slicing algorithm was developed to compensate for the variation of stature during 3D printing, preserving the original part size [61] . Brooks et al. [58] have also described a Fig. 7 Schematic illustrations of the alternative small-scale screw-assisted printhead designs developed by a Annoni et al. [17] , b Canessa et al. [18] , c Liu et al. [19] , and d Khondoker, Sameoto [40] screw-assisted deposition tool that could be used for largescale 3D printing, but it was explored in the manufacture of thin-shelled parts without the need for supports. Instead of moving the printhead, a convex deposition surface was attached to the robotic arm so that it could be moved with six degrees-of-freedom. Pellets of polymer filled with vegetal fiber were processed. The focus of their paper was on the algorithm developed to generate the printing trajectory of 2D geometries projected to the deposition surface. Similarly, the AM system described by Schmidt et al. [62] had a fixed printhead, with the deposition surface attached to a robotic arm that could move on six axes. The custom-made printhead included a screw with a compression profile. Calibration experiments were performed in function of the material type and, since the material flow rate was known under different conditions, 3D printing tests were conducted at a range of speeds. Test specimens were cut from single-walled cylinders built under a continuous extrusion mode.",

The printing quality achieved with the screwassisted system was compared to the results from a low-cost desktop FFF 3D printer, using self-fabricated hardmetal filaments. As discussed by the authors, the smaller nozzle diameter generated higher extrusion pressure that was beneficial to the quality of the printed parts.",

Besides, a reciprocating z-tamping attachment was added to the printhead to further reduce porosity and improve interlayer adhesion. Process feasibility was first demonstrated using neat polymer pellets but, due to the expressive distortion and warping, fiber-reinforced materials became preferred. The BAAM\u00ae machine was explored in several publications, using diverse materials, including composites based on high-temperature thermoplastics [65, [67] [68] [69] . Due to the significant difference between the large-and small-scale EAM, the BAAM\u00ae process was investigated with the aid of thermomechanical modeling [64] , leading to the development of specific design guidelines for large-scale 3D printing by Roschli et al.

Tensile test specimens were fabricated, and the properties from the recycled materials were found to be comparable to the virgin polymers. Later publications described recycling tests with other materials [71] [72] [73] , obtained from ground plastic parts. Besides calibration experiments and the fabrication of test specimens, complex parts were 3D printed to demonstrate technical and economic feasibility [71, 73] . However, the 3D printing tests with composite particles made of hard and flexible polymers performed by Dertinger et al. [72] were unsuccessful due to feeding difficulties. Later, Little et al.

Although it can be seen as the core of the printhead, screw design was strictly considered by few authors [13, 15, 39, 59, 62] mostly to meet specific performance requirements. Peripherals such as independent feeding systems [13, 35, 72] , pre-melting chamber [19, 45] , additional cooling elements [36, 58, 71] , additional heaters [34] , and other mechanisms to improve the state of the deposited layer [34, 56, 57, 63] have also been proved important to achieve consistent results.",

This involves initial tests for the system's calibration, usually to correlate the screw rotation speed with the material output at different temperatures [26, 30, 34, 40, 59, 62] . Knowing the volumetric output was critical to estimate a range of values for the deposition speed. Functional validation involves actual 3D printing and is often followed by a quality assessment. This often involves mechanical testing [13, 16, 19, 24, 25, 32, 34-40, 42-44, 56, 59, 62, 63] , microscopic analysis [11, 12, 14, 16, 17, 22, 34, 35, 37, 38, 42, 43, 45, 47, 53, 63] , and surface analysis [13, 34, 38] . Depending on the intended application, other tests (e.g., biological [11, 14, 44, [47] [48] [49] , physic-chemical [16, 21, 37, 45, 47, 49, 51, 53] ) might be needed. Comparison with the performance achieved by other machines and/or technologies may also be valuable [41, 54, 71, 72] .",

The machines have been organized and described over time, to evidence the continuous improvements and evolution of the technique, and the printhead modifications have been summarized and correlated to the materials processed and performance requirements. In the end, a brief discussion on the common stages that have been undertaken for the development of the described equipment was made. Both for experimental and commercial systems, the most exploited constructive solution consists of vertical screw extruders, to which polymer-based granules are fed and then extruded through the deposition nozzle, constituting a single-stage process. For small-scale systems, the printheads often require a miniaturized screw mechanism, and its fabrication may represent most of the development costs. In turn, large-scale systems can benefit from benchtop-sized screw extruders, reducing costs and expediting equipment development. The aggregation state of the granules seems to be more critical to a successful extrusion process than physical properties of feedstock, and modifications on the design of the screw were made mostly to address specific performance requirements.",
