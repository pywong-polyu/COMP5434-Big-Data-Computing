Results: In China, only a small portion of the COVID-19-related research focused on gender experiences and differences. Near the end of the six-month literature review period, a small number of research items emerged on women healthcare workers, women's mental health, and pregnant women's access to care. There was an absence of research on the gendered impact of COVID-19 amongst populations. There was minimal consideration of the economic, social and security factors, including gender stereotypes and expectations, that affected different populations' experiences of infection, treatment, and lockdown during the period of review. Conclusion: At the outset of health emergencies in China, gender research needs to be prioritised during the first stage of an outbreak to assist with evaluation of the most effective public health measures, identifying access to healthcare and social welfare barriers amongst priority communities. Gender stereotypes and gendered differences lead to different patterns of exposure and treatment. The exclusion of this knowledge in real time affects the design of effective prevention and recovery.",

Prior to the outbreak of COVID-19, the National Health Commission had been pursuing a range of improvements to its collection and analysis of health data, including the introduction of national level sexdisaggregated data. Over the last 10 years, the Chinese government has progressed a range of gender equality laws in the workplace and recently introduced an antidomestic violence law. However, in practice, social attitudes to gender equality and women's empowerment have been described as requiring more awareness. In a survey of men's and women's attitudes on vulnerability to climate change and disaster risks, it was found that women have \"less decision-making power on issues other than daily expenses\" and \"women have fewer opportunities to participate in their communities' public affairs\" [12] . Moreover, the representation of women in national and sub-national discussions on disaster risk and reduction tends to position women as \"vulnerable\" rather than \"active agents\" [13] . The UN, in its 2019 China Annual Report also noted the need to \"strengthen the evidence base and understanding of China's progress on international, regional and national commitments towards gender equality and women's empowerment\" [14] . In the same report, UN Women documented ongoing work to \"tackle social norms and stereotypes that sustain gender inequality and trigger gender based violence\" [15] .",

Gendered experiences overlap with age, income, ethnicity, and disability. These experiences and differences interact to create differentiated risks of exposure amongst populations. Gender analysis, which includes the analysis of overlapping themes like social, economic, and physical security, pre-existing health conditions and access to care, help public health officials identify and understand how different populations will interpret and respond to public health measures [6] . Sex, age and disability disaggregated data, on their own will not reveal the social norms and stereotypes that dictate how different populations respond to public health measures and lockdown orders. A health emergency places stress on pre-existing inequalities and discrimination. As such, a health emergency can initiate and exacerbate inequality and discrimination [9] . Emergency response measures, while necessary, can place different groups into situations that are dangerous or harmful. Rapid research into gender, as well as ethnicity, disability, age, and economic experiences during health emergencies is vital to identify the healthcare measures, social supports, and protections needed to ensure public health compliance and equitable recovery. This paper examines the real-time research that was being conducted on COVID-19, sex, and gender during China's first wave of infections.",

First, two reviewer coders independently screened titles and abstracts to determine the inclusion status. To qualify for the review, studies had to describe the effects of COVID-19 (or SARS-Cov-2) with reference to one or more of the following keywords: male/men or female/women or gender. Second, full text of any items with potential to meet the review inclusion criteria was obtained and assessed against the review inclusion criteria by the same two coders (see Table 1 ).

The retrieved studies were categorised under five themes identified in a rapid gender assessment matrix designed for the COVID-19 pandemic [15] . The five areas selected in the matrix aim to identify what knowledge, experiences and responses to the COVID-19 outbreak were informed by risk (of exposure), illness, and access to health services, as well as social, economic, and security conditions. The gender and health matrix methodology organises research into five categories that seek to uncover where gender research is concentrated and/or missing: individual risk and vulnerability, experience of illness and treatment, general access to health services, social impacts of crisis, and security impacts of crisis. The matrix, as an analytical tool, permits examination of concentration of gendered investigation and studies during an event, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and serves to highlight knowledge gaps. Below, for each category we describe the general findings from the assignment of articles under each theme [18] . The vast literature was grouped, analytically, under the five themes through quantifiable means. The authors frequently collaborated to ensure shared understanding of the thematic areas to analyse and group each publication. The authors do not claim to comment on the quality of the studies, nor evaluate the strength of the evidence or data presented in the publications. A limitation of this research is that the included studies did not examine men, transgender, or non-binary gendered experiences.",

The majority of research consisted of sexdisaggregated studies (Chinese and English) on the risk of COVID-19 to medical staff (n = 82), the elderly (n = 29), children and infants (n = 34), pregnant women (n = 18) and others (n = 14). Publications on the first wave of the outbreak examined the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on women healthcare workers and carers in Hubei [23] . Women healthcare workers are the majority of healthcare workers across China, including Hubei. Some studies examined the prevalence of PPE-related skin injuries among nurses [24] . Several research papers were published on women healthcare workers' struggle to work under the measures taken by the authorities [25] . There was a noticeable increase in the number of studies on healthcare workers' mental health assessed through online surveys focused on sleep quality, anxiety and stress [26, 27] . These studies tended to focus on women healthcare workers. There was little examination of whether this high volume of women healthcare workers experiencing stress and precarity is due to social gender norms that associate women with vulnerability (i.e. it is more socially acceptable for women to discuss personal vulnerabilities than men). There is also the fact that women healthcare workers were primarily the frontline staff, who were at high potential risk of infection due to the illness' characteristics of high transmission efficiency, rapid deterioration and pathogenicity. We note there is an absence of men and their experiences as healthcare workers at risk of infection. The multitude of papers that refer to women healthcare workers and mental illness, with lack of consideration as to whether and if men were equally affected, points to unchallenged gender stereotypes in the research publications examining the impact of COVID-19 on risk of infection and risk of associated illness.",

The only exception near the end of the six-month period was studies that recruited research participants who were pregnant [42] [43] [44] [45] : 53 articles were published in this period discussing COVID-19 treatment in conjunction with pregnancy.",

This finding is consistent with other studies that have found gender research gaps in China's response to other health epidemics including HIV/AIDS [84] . The only exception was pregnant women, but these studies were not gender studies of their experiences and stereotypes encountered during COVID-19 lockdown. The studies focused on pregnant women as a priority group as they need to access hospital facilities regularly and are at higher risk of infection in hospital. Coupled with this is a (gendered) cultural tradition that emphasises the importance of \"mother and child\" with most families still having low fertility rates. Protecting the health concerns and needs of expecting mums and the unborn is a very high priority in China [19] .",

The published research focused on sex disaggregation to explain experiences of COVID-19 infection and lockdown impacts. It is important sex-disaggregated data is available in real time but this data alone is not sufficient for rapid gender analysis.

The sexdisaggregated research published during the first wave revealed high rates of infection amongst healthcare workers, the majority of them being women. Women healthcare workers' mental stress may have had nothing to do with their \"biological tendencies\" but their real risk of exposure. The exclusion of this knowledge in real time affects the design of effective prevention and recovery. There was very little research on the social, security, and economic drivers of the pandemic during the first wave of COVID-19 in China. The knowledge gaps that occur in the first wave of an outbreak may be tied to the research and policy directives prioritised at the start of the pandemic and in the recovery stages. Capturing sexdisaggregated data is the first step. The next step is to examine the how gender stereotypes and gendered differences lead to different patterns of exposure and treatment in China. There needs to be a research-policy feedback loop that values this research to ensure the design of even more effective policy. Gender analysis during the first stage of an outbreak can assist with evaluation of most effective public health measures, identify access to health barriers amongst priority communities, and serve to create a feedback loop for more effective gender-inclusive policy and recovery.
