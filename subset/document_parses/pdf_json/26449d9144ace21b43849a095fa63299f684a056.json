The authors acknowledge insufficient evidence in support of transmission via faeco-oral route and identify the need for further Accepted Article research regarding the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in the context of human faeces. However, it is equally pertinent to consider the viability of the virus in faecal bio-aerosols generated by toilet plumes [2] . During the SARS outbreak, it was suggested that a major contributor for the rapid transmission of the initial 187 cases in Hong Kong was propagated by an aerosolisation effect of SARS-CoV-1 in faeces with notably high viral load [3] . There is considerable variation in the This consideration extends to the handling of faecal wastes discharged from hospitals and others sources. Sewage discharged from two hospitals in Beijing during the SARS outbreak identified positive for SARS-CoV-1 [4] . Using quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR methods, Wang and colleagues confirmed the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in hospital inlets of a preprocessing disinfection sewage pool [5] . Though this review is currently dismissive of faecooral transmission based on the available evidence, data in this area is rapidly evolving. Given the far-reaching consequences that this would pose for the environment and nosocomial infection risk, the viability of SARS-CoV-2 in faecal bio-aerosols in addition to human faeces should be considered an urgent priority. Heightened care in the management of faecal wastes is an imperative intervention until these questions are answered.",
