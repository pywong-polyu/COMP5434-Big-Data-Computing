The benefits of exercise for reducing disability in individuals with Parkinson's disease are numerous. However, not much is known about the designing and prescription of exercise in neurodegenerative diseases. A brief review and indications for exercise prescription and evaluation are discussed throughout. In this scoping review, we specifically aimed to describe the applicability of walking tests (6-min/10-m) for the prescription of exercise in individuals with Parkinson's disease and to propose training (undulating periodized) designs in three exercise modalities, Brazilian dance rhythms (Samba and Forr\u00f3), deep-water exercises, and Nordic walking. These training models and evaluation methods may assist coaches and therapists in organizing exercise programs adequate to people with Parkinson's disease, and are essential steps toward a comprehensive and more detailed understanding of the training loads in motor disorders and disease states.",

            "text": "Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disease worldwide. In developed countries, approximately 1% of the population over 65 years and 3-5% of people over 85 years are affected by the disease [1] . PD patients present motor and nonmotor symptoms such as rigid muscles, bradykinesia, tremors, postural instability, changes in gait, autonomic dysfunction, sleep, cognitive, and neuropsychiatric disorders [2, 3] . These symptoms provoke a severe impairment in the functional autonomy of people with PD. In addition, reduced social interactions contribute to depressive symptoms and impair the quality of life of this population [4] . Another critical feature of the PD is that reduced functional mobility is related to muscle voluntary activation deficits mediated by muscle/motor and transmission/machine efficiency ( Fig. 1) [5, 6] . Most of the symptoms result from the death of dopaminergic neurons and changes in the pathways of the base nuclei [7] . Furthermore, the gait impairment in these patients also seems to be related to muscle weakness and central and muscular fatigue [8] . The practical implication of this rationale is that some exercise interventions may represent impressive improvements in the functional parameters (e.g., timed up and go and 10 m walk test) due to concomitant enhancements on muscle efficiency (mitochondrial and cardiorespiratory adaptations) and transmission efficiency (intersegmental coordination, mechanical work production, and muscle cocontraction) [6] .",

The research data indicate that, together with drug therapy, regular physical activity could promote additional improvements in the functionality and clinical symptoms of people with PD [9] . Walking endurance training is a usual exercise because it is considered a functional activity and, therefore, well recommended for people with PD [10] . This exercise method assists in functional mobility and the improvement of spatiotemporal gait parameters. Moreover, Nordic walking, a newer exercise intervention using one pair of poles, is recognized as a powerful method to improve functional mobility and quality of life in healthy [24, 28] and PD [5, 11, 12] individuals. Dance is another kind of practice that has emerged as a possible complementary therapeutic strategy to promote physical, psychological, and social benefits [13] . Dance practices, like walking, require constant weight transfer between legs at different rhythms according to musical stimuli and changes in direction. In addition to being accessible to Parkinsonians [10] , dance classes can help improve motor parameters [14] , increase quality of life, stimulate socialization, and provide greater motivation to adhere to body movement practices [13, 15] . Randomized controlled trials [16, 17] have shown aquatic exercise as an effective method to reduce the disability in PD. Therefore, many studies have sought to investigate the effects of exercise in people with PD [9, 10, 18, 19] . However, information about protocols, interventions, methodologies is still poorly described [20, 21] . An exciting exercise framework was recently proposed based on the constraint-focused agility exercises, including progressive levels of sensorimotor, resistance, and coordination challenges.",

Therefore, we carried out a narrative synthesis rather than a systematic review approach to exercise interventions and PD evaluation. The most studied types of exercise intervention are aerobic as walking, Nordic walking, cycling, treadmill walking [9, 11, 12, 24] , muscle strength [25] , Tai Chi [26] , and dance [13] [14] [15] . Aquatic exercises are less studied, although initial evidence shows that these interventions have good potential for people in advanced stages of the disease due to the aid of fluctuation during exercise [16, 17, 20] . Besides, most dance studies focusing on tango and Brazilian rhythms also have the potential for adherence due to The nigrostriatal dopaminergic loss and degeneration and thalamic circuitry impaired result in the cardinal motor symptoms (bradykinesia, tremor, freezing, and postural instability), which in turn imply a low overall efficiency caused by cellular and metabolic alterations (muscle efficiency) and intersegmental coordination and mechanical production impairments that negatively impacts the functional mobility in individuals with Parkinson's disease the challenging and motivational rhythmic characteristics of Forr\u00f3 and samba. Nordic walking has assistive potential compared to free walking as it increases safety and mobility, demonstrated from an acute [27] and chronic [5] point of view. In addition, the use of poles allows a higher self-selected speed improving the pendulum walking mechanism [24, 28] . Another type of intervention less studied for people with PD is the high-intensity (interval) exercises. Recently, we confirmed the safety and feasibility of the sprint as an exercise method for PD. However, some biomechanical adjustments must be considered in this training, such as impaired mechanical effectiveness and increased maximal force employed due to slowness features [29] .",

Everyone completes three consecutive trials for each walking test, for a total of 6 walking trials. The order of application of the two different walking speed conditions is randomly varied among practitioners to avoid sequencing effects. It involves a 14 m straight path, with 2 m provided for acceleration, 10 m for steady-state walking, and 2 m for deceleration. These distances are provided at the beginning and end of the walkway to allow participants space to accelerate/decelerate outside the data collection area to help reduce gait variability introduced during these phases. Therefore, the markers are placed at the 0, 2, 12, and 14 m positions along the path. The individuals are asked to walk the 14 m, and begin to walk \"at a comfortable pace, usual pace at one end of the path, and continues walking until he or she reaches the other end. The individuals are instructed to walk at maximum pace, maximum speed, without running for the maximum condition. The evaluator uses a stopwatch to register how much time it takes for the individual to cross the 10 m center of the path, starting the stopwatch as soon as the individual's hip crosses the second marker and stopping the stopwatch as soon as the individual's hip crosses the third marker.",

Also, it correlates well with critical functional results comprising mortality [47] . Although its widespread use, there are no standard values for people with Parkinson's disease. Therefore, we have been applying the 6MWT as usually described in the literature [46] , using the protocol standard 30 m walkway. According to the American Thoracic Society (ATS) protocol, the test location is characterized by a flat, clean, illuminated, and enclosed (indoor) walkway 30 m in length. The protocol requires 180\u00b0 turns at either end of the walkway, and additional space for turning is needed. In our experience, and based on the studies using the 6MWT in seniors with intellectual disabilities [48] , we suggest a prior 20-min session for familiarization to test. They are asked to walk up and down, avoiding jogging or running, as fast as they can and as far as possible. The practitioners can terminate at any time but are motivated to restart as soon as possible. During the 6 min, participants are continuously verbally encouraged using standardized messages. The walkway is marked with cones every meter, and at both extremes of the corridor, two researchers and two different cones are allocated to show where participants must change the direction. During the 6MWT, ratings of perceived exertion are monitored accordingly [49] . The number of meters is registered at the end of the test to the closest 0.5 m. Therefore, the training volume of three training methods is calculated based on distance coefficient, in turn, determined by the ratio between the distance covered in the 6MWT and the predicted distance based on age, height, and body mass (Eqs. 3, 4, and 5) [50] :",
