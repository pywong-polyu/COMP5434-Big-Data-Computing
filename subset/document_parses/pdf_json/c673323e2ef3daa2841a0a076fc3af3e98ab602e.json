            "text": "Medical education globally trends towards integrating more practical training in general practitioner (GP) practices or smaller regional hospitals and health centres and away from the academic medical centre or university hospital. Those former settings are called community-based or decentral learning environments (DLE). [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Several studies show that exposure to such environments motivates medical students to pursue careers related to outpatient work. [8] [9] [10] There are two main arguments for training in DLE: first, medical students need to develop basic competencies in population-based health approaches and treating common diseases as well as rare diseases. 2 4 5 University hospitals tend to overrepresent the latter. 11 Second, healthcare (HC) systems need a workforce that follows career paths in outpatient HC, is willing to work in remote areas, and with population-based health problems (ie, sanitation, infectious diseases). 5 12-15 The lack of such a workforce impacts a HC system's responsiveness to extraordinary events such as natural disasters, wars or a pandemic. 14 16 WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ON THIS TOPIC \u21d2 In Brazil and Germany, there is a disconnect between health care needs and medical education. To prepare health workers for global challenges, there is a need for resilient, evidence-based approaches to transform traditional curricula into curricula that are aligned with community health care needs.",

            "text": "DLE training takes on different forms around the world with varying degrees of implementation in the curriculum. The WHO has stated that global curricular reform efforts should target medical training to local and national needs. Even so, hospital-oriented and highly specialised training with little or no attention to HC responsiveness to communities is still prevalent. 17 Whether or not DLE offer effective training scenarios for medical students-especially in comparison to university hospital centred training-is debated. [18] [19] [20] Heterogeneity and difficulties in managing teaching quality 7 21 are used as arguments against DLE training. 22 In the scientific literature, the debate prominently follows a 'Western' ideal of medical education first introduced to the global medical education community by Flexner: In 1910 and 1912, Flexner reported on teaching quality in medical schools and medical faculties in the USA, Canada 23 and Europe. 24 At that time, heterogeneous 'medical schools' used questionable methods and standards to train physicians in North America. [25] [26] [27] [28] Flexner advocated establishing more stringent admission criteria, requiring basic science studies prior to clinical medical education, centralising medical education to university hospitals, and instituting full-time teachers grounded in the basic sciences at medical schools. 23 [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] In short, his credo at the time reads as direct opposite of the current movement towards teaching in DLE today. 3 5 18 30 Flexner's ideas of a scientific base and bedside teaching were deemed universally applicable and shaped ideas on the quality of teaching for a global medical curriculum. 17 31 This is also referred to as 'post-Flexner' curriculum. 26 32 Bleakley postulated that post-Flexnerian terms used in the current global debate on the medical curriculum, such as 'core competencies' and 'standardisation of teaching', when analysed through a postcolonial perspective, promote Western values even though the promoters of such discourse acknowledge the need to respect local differences and celebrate diversity. 31 33 Postcolonial studies promote critical thinking about globalisation. Essentially, post-colonial theory binds the aftermath of South Globe's colonial liberation in the 1960s and 1970s (ie, India, Algeria, Angola, Mozambique) to the exponential expansion of capital in the 1980s and 1990s. It postulates that the Global South's direct colonial rule by the North Globe was replaced by an economic, cultural and political dependency on the North Globe. 34 35 De Alva 36 decoupled the term postcoloniality from formal decolonisation because people living in both once colonised and once colonising countries are still subject to the mechanics of global capitalism.",

UFF refers to those settings as 'real' 45 training scenarios, UKT calls them 'DLE'. 7 In contrast, state-of-the-art medicine in university hospitals and research centres is referred to as 'ideal' (UFF) and 'central' (UKT) medical training. Second, in these training settings, HC providers are the primary mentors and facilitators of learning, as described by Worley et al. 46 Third, the focus of training efforts in real/decentral settings is to bring about HC practitioners who provide HC that also satisfy population health needs. Fourth, both institutes believe in a holistic view of medicine that integrates specific social contexts and emphasises the humanity of individuals.",

In contrast to developments in North America and Canada, universities were the only places for curricular medical teaching until communitybased learning environments were introduced in 1980 (Brazil) and 2002 (Germany). 28 29 In both countries, DLE have been regarded as inferior medical teaching settings. At the same time, DLE enjoy freedom in carrying out medical teaching locally. 5 6 While each learning environment has developed preferred methods, contents, and approaches to teaching, the only exchange between the environments was through medical students, funding, and the occasional meeting between the university and community-based teachers. Over time, the two settings have evolved apart. DLE have concentrated even more on their service to the community. They focus on 1:1 teaching, community orientation, mentoring and 'soft skills'. University hospitals have adapted more to post-Flexnerian ideas of standardisation and measurable outcomes for teaching. 17 32 37 Both environments have been exposed to advances in medicine such as digitalisation and personalised medicine. Stakeholder groups have developed diverging attitudes, roles, norms, and teaching skills. 6 7 37 Currently, students, practising physicians and teachers have limited experience working between and across different HC sectors. The resulting ineffective communication and lack of exchange heavily impact HC quality on both ends of the spectrum and in the transfer between 47 For medical students, the disconnect in teaching and HC delivery becomes palpable when transitioning and comparing their central to the decentral learning experiences. Since they are mainly socialised in central training, accepting the Flexnerian thinking that DLE are inferior teaching environments is easier than challenging the norms and values attained in the 'hidden curriculum'. 30 More interprofessional and intersectoral exchange must be established in the curriculum to counteract this situation. A postcolonial perspective on these complex tensions helps to understand a critical point: course managers who confront decentral teachers with a centrally managed curriculum and a post-Flexnerian terminology of standardisation and QM may evoke feelings of governance by a central body-in this case, the university. At the same time, community-based teachers want to be valued members of the teaching community. If they perceive prejudice against them by medical students or other university representatives (eg, expecting lower quality of HC and/or teaching in DLE), they will be hesitant to engage in a constructive exchange with the organisation they hold responsible for these attitudes. They might instead engage in bolstering their independence.",

This development was rooted in Brazil's social and HC needs, inspired by pedagogue Paulo Freire and his ideas of human liberation. 45 Brazil's current course adapting to the Western framework risks losing some of its advances in decentral teaching. In this regard, Loomba et al 34 subsidises our critique stating, 'neo colonialism is not just something that happens from outside a country or a people, not just something that operates with the collusion of forces inside, but a version of it can be duplicated from within individuals.' Thus, a potential threat does not lie in an outside aggressor but in the thoughtless fulfilment of an ideology in individuals: in our example, the notion that high-tech medicine is superior or DLE offering learning experiences of 'bad medicine for poor people'.",
