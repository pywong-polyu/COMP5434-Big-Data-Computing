            "text": "Purpose To evaluate the impact of using consistent complication-avoidance protocols in patients undergoing endoscopic pituitary adenoma surgery including techniques for avoiding anosmia, epistaxis, carotid artery injury, hypopituitarism, cerebrospinal fluid leaks and meningitis. Methods All patients undergoing endoscopic adenoma resection from 2010 to 2020 were included. Primary outcomes included 90-day complication rates, gland function outcomes, reoperations, readmissions and length of stay. Secondary outcomes were extent of resection, short-term endocrine remission, vision recovery. Results Of 514 patients, (mean age 51 \u00b1 16 years; 78% macroadenomas, 19% prior surgery) major complications occurred in 18(3.5%) patients, most commonly CSF leak (9, 1.7%) and meningitis (4, 0.8%). In 14 of 18 patients, complications were deemed preventable. Four (0.8%) had complications with permanent sequelae (3 before 2016): one unexplained mortality, one stroke, one oculomotor nerve palsy, one oculoparesis. There were no internal carotid artery injuries, permanent visual worsening or permanent anosmia. New hypopituitarism occurred in 23/485(4.7%). Partial or complete hypopituitarism resolution occurred in 102/193(52.8%) patients. Median LOS was 2 days; 98.3% of patients were discharged home. Comparing 18 patients with major complications versus 496 without, median LOS was 7 versus 2 days, respectively p < 0.001. Readmissions occurred in 6%(31/535), mostly for hyponatremia (18/31). Gross total resection was achieved in 214/312(69%) endocrine-inactive adenomas; biochemical remission was achieved in 148/209(71%) endocrine-active adenomas. Visual field or acuity defects improved in 126/138(91.3%) patients. Conclusion This study suggests that conformance to established protocols for endoscopic pituitary surgery may minimize complications, re-admissions and LOS while enhancing the likelihood of preserving gland function, although there remains opportunity for further improvements.",

            "text": "Pituitary adenomas are the third most common primary intracranial tumor accounting for approximately 15% of all intracranial tumors, and surgical resection is considered first-line therapy for all adenoma subtypes except prolactinomas [1, 2] . Transsphenoidal pituitary surgery dates back over a century, becoming well-established with overall excellent outcomes in the 1970s [3] . Numerous advances since the 1990s appear to have improved the safety and efficacy of this procedure [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Arguably, the most important advance is the application of endoscopy which has JaiDeep Thakur and Alex Corlin have contributed equally to the study. become the predominant visualization tool and replaced the operating microscope at many centers [4, 5, 17] . This transition has fueled collaboration between otolaryngologists and neurosurgeons in endoscopic skull base surgery, resulting in expanded knowledge of skull base and parasellar anatomy and refined surgical approaches, resection and reconstruction techniques (Fig. 1 ). Since 2013, most pituitary adenoma operations in the United States are performed endoscopically, and the endonasal route is increasingly the preferred route for many midline skull base tumors such as craniopharyngiomas, meningiomas and clival chordomas [18] . Other important technological and technique innovations include (1) the \"rescue flap\" technique which spares the sphenopalatine vascular pedicle along the nasal septum as well as the septal olfactory strip to avoid postoperative epistaxis and anosmia [15, 16] ; (2) Doppler probe localization of the parasellar carotid arteries for avoiding ICA injury [8] , (3) the pseudocapsular dissection technique for maximizing chances of remission/resection as well as gland sparing and incising techniques for preserving pituitary gland function [7, 19] , and (4) graded repair technique for improved skull base closure, including the selective use of pedicle nasoseptal flaps to avoid CSF leaks and bacterial meningitis [9] [10] [11] . From an organizational aspect, the concept of multidisciplinary pituitary centers of excellence has been promoted to better integrate collaboration among neurosurgeons, endocrinologists, otolaryngologists, neuroophthalmologists and radiation oncologists, to optimize overall management [12, 13] . Consensus guidelines have also been produced by endocrinology and neurosurgical experts in the field that have provided recommendations on optimal multidisciplinary management of specific adenoma subtypes such as acromegaly and Cushing's disease [20, 21] .",

We also Fig. 1 Complication avoidance protocols and operative suite setup for endoscopic pituitary adenoma surgery with neurosurgery and otorhinolaryngology (ENT).

Since many patients came with testing from outside laboratories, results were interpreted based on provided reference ranges. Stalk-compression hyperprolactinemia (serum prolactin > 20 ng/ml for men and > 25 ng/ ml for women) and its recovery were reported as separate outcomes. Although IGF-1 and growth hormone (GH) were collected on all patients, somatotroph axis analysis was excluded from the study given infrequent use of stimulation testing to assess for pre-and post-operative GH deficiency. Improvement in any of the three anterior gland axes was based on normalization of values or being weaned off replacement therapy, at 6 weeks or greater post-surgery.

The bilateral rescue flap and mucosal preservation technique strives to maintain anatomical and physiological integrity of the septal olfactory strip. The added benefit of rare middle turbinate resection and rare use of pedicled nasoseptal flaps (2.2% in this cohort), also likely contribute to the absence of permanent anosmia in this series [15, 26, 40] . While patients typically have transient hyposmia or anosmia during the first 1-4 weeks post-surgery, likely resulting from mucosal swelling and surgical manipulation, olfaction almost always fully recovers and is likely hastened by daily sinonasal care with physiological saline irrigations and at least 2-3 endonasal debridements performed in the first 6 weeks post-surgery [15, 40] .",

            "text": "This current series is unique in two aspects. First, there are few cohort studies with over 500 patients treated with the endoscopic endonasal approach. Second, there are no series to our knowledge that have analyzed major complication rates, LOS, readmissions and reoperations relative to the use of these specific complication avoidance protocols of (1) rescue flap approach, (2) Doppler probe for ICA localization, (3) pseudocapsular dissection and gland sparring techniques, and (4) graded repair of CSF leaks (Fig. 1) . Our data suggests this protocolized approach is associated with low major complication rates of < 1% (for death, stroke, visual worsening, other neurological deficits, sellar hematoma, meningitis and anosmia), CSF leaks rates of under 2% and new hypopituitarism of under 5% (both of which are similar or lower than prior cohort studies) [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [41] [42] [43] . Infrequent complications in the present series were also associated with a median LOS of 2 days and a 30-day readmission rate of 6%, similar to recent cohort studies but considerably shorter than national database studies [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . Other studies have shown complication rates correlate inversely with hospital and surgical team experience [12, 43, [49] [50] [51] [52] . Similarly, reoperations and readmissions (which was 10.4% in a recent national database study) are linked to complications, particularly hyponatremia and postoperative CSF rhinorrhea, and as our experience confirms, are linked to longer LOS [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] .",

Achieving optimal outcomes with high resection and remission rates, rare complications and few readmissions appears possible when an experienced team adhere to protocols for (1) avoiding vascular and gland injury, (2) achieving maximal tumor removal without causing new deficits of gland function or neurological deficits, (3) using reliable skull base closure techniques to avoid postoperative CSF leaks, (4) avoiding new postoperative anosmia, epistaxis and preserving sinonasal mucociliary function (5) promoting rapid mobilization, and discharge of patients, and (6) providing consistent and easy to follow discharge instructions on fluid intake and physical activity that reduce chances for delayed hyponatremia and CSF leak/meningitis [28] . The recent report by Burke et al. highlight the potential benefit of a strict outpatient protocol of fluid restriction for virtually eliminating readmissions for hyponatremia. In the current study, we had 18 readmissions for hyponatremia over 10 years; however, since launching a similar protocol in 2018, we have had only one such readmission in May 2018. The combination of a consistent post-discharge regimen for fluid restriction, liberal salt use and salted drinks in the first week post-surgery, as well as assessing serum sodium on post-operative day 5-7 appears to be effective in preventing and/or blunting most cases of delayed hyponatremia before a patient requires hospital readmission [58] . However, given that some patients leave the hospital in DI (12.1% transient and 2.3% permanent in this cohort) and are prescribed DDAVP as needed, individualized care and close team contact is essential for managing fluid balance especially in the first 2 weeks post-surgery.",
