Though, such features of social media platforms also present it a root cause of fake news distribution, causing adverse consequences on both people and culture. Hence, detecting fake news has become a significant research interest for bringing feasible real time solutions to the problem. Most current techniques of fake news disclosure are supervised, that need large cost in terms of time and effort to make a certainly interpreted dataset. The proposed framework concentrates on the text-based detection of fake news items while considering that only limited number of labels are available. Graphs are functioned extensively under several purposes of real-world problems on the strength of their property to structure things easily. Deep neural networks are used to generate great results within tasks that utilizes graph classification. The Graph Convolution Network works as a deep learning paradigm which works on graphs. Our proposed framework deals with limited amount of labelled data; we go for a semi-supervised learning method. We come up with a semisupervised fake news detection technique based on GCN (Graph Convolutional Networks).",

Graphs normally occur in various real-world problems employing cultural and social issues. Information that is accessible to us can be transformed in a structured way by means of connections between various objects to give promising insights regarding data [5] . One crucial issue in Artificial Intelligence problems is to draw meaningful relation between one part of data to other parts of data.

Supervised technologies are well established to provide benchmark solutions in healthcare, data authentication, web services, security and many more fields. The realm of semi-supervised and unsupervised paradigm still needs to be judiciously explored. The major pitfall of supervised training methods are annotation inconsistencies, cost and manpower required due to massive data size. In order to create a good balance between labelled and unlabelled data we tried to use both at their best level of performance. Labelled data steers the training process towards right direction and unlabelled data is used to enhance model generalization as well as performance. Therefore, a good balance of both is highly required that we categorically attempted to incorporate in our suggested framework. Kusner et al [6] established Word Mover's Distance in 2015 as a distinct case of Earth Mover's Distance [7] and also proved that WMD gives unprecedented performance when coupled with K-nearest neighbour in classification tasks. This measure is suitable for calculating the distance between two text documents based on alignment between the words that are semantically close but syntactically different. It basically measures the dissimilarity between two text documents as the minimum distance the word vectors of one document need to travel to reach the word vectors of another document. GCN and its variants are being well tested to provide outstanding performance in variety of real-life applications incorporating both textual and visual data such as automatic seizure detection using temporal GCN [8] , spatiotemporal GCN for picking up and returning demand of public bike sharing by exploring information from multi-view data [9] , Autism Spectrum Disorder and Alzheimer's Disease prediction with imaging and non-imaging information [10] , semi-supervised hyperspectral image (HIS) classification framework using spectral-spatial graph convolution network (S 2 GCN) [11] , multi-stream attention-enhanced adaptive graph convolutional neural network (MS-AAGCN) for skeleton-based action recognition [12] etc.",

This encourages us to take benefits of Graph Convolution Network for classification. Given one node, for all the classes can virtually start training procedure. Such a model, can very quickly lead to the creation of a 2d vector space with word embeddings involved which could be visualized easily. As a result, it can be seen that with just 3 layers in the architecture along with one label per actual class and absolutely no features in place, a linear classification is made.

This uncontrolled nature usually leads to generation and dissemination of biased contents. These untruthful events cause damage to social stability, economy and politics. One such rumour circulated on social media on 30 may 2018 regarding the spread of Nipah Virus through broiler chicken; causing huge financial loss to the dealers.On 4 January 2018 a fake news regarding collapse of metro pillar in Bangalore created unrest and panic in the public. A tidal wave of false claims and remedies has been burst out following COVID19 pademic such as curing the infection with garlic water, inhaling hot hair with hairdryer, use of certain vitamins or snake oils as remedy, use of vodka or vinegar as most effective hand sanitizer, unleashing lions on Russian streets to keep people indoor etc. These are few of the numerous instances of fake news circulating like wild fire on social media every day. Paramount research in literature is engrossed around detecting fraudulent contents using rule-based methods or traditional machine learning classifiers. These traditional techniques fail to provide exemplary performance in the presence of large volumes of data, suffers with annotation inconsistencies, necessitate huge efforts for feature engineering and cannot provide near real time solutions. The reasons of inaccurate fact circulation spans across a broad spectrum incorporating genuine reporting faults, false interpretations, incorrect use of idioms or phrases, monetary benefits, political propaganda, marketing gimmick etc. but in all its camouflaged formats it poses a serious threat in front of the mankind. Therefore, in this work we tried to come up with a solution to this problem taking into consideration three key technologies involving GloVe word embedding, Word Mover's Distance (WMD) and Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN).",

Word Vectors in such an n-dimensional space, occurs in the manner as similar words appear close to each other while words with different meanings appear far from each other. One major advantage that GloVe offers is its dependency on global statistics instead of local statistics as used by Word2Vec or some other embedding techniques. GloVe is based on the basic principle of cooccurrence matrix. A simple example of a co -occurrence matrix of window size 1 is depicted inFigure 3, illustrates how words befall collectively that ultimately produces the relations between individual words. Co-occurrence matrix for words is calculated just by adding the mutuality of occurrence of words in an obtained text. In general use cases this co-occurrence matrix is decomposed by employing dimensional reduction techniques like PCA and SVD. An example co-occurrence matrix for the sentence \"the cat sat on the mat\"",

A node itself in the graph normally denotes a real-world object i.e. in our framework it represents news articles. The graph has been extensively employed to represent objects of real-world and the connection between them. Node/graph classification results prediction of labels of nodes in the graphs, for this purpose several researches take advantage of relationships among nodes to increase the classification efficiency.GCN is one of the prominent variants of Graph Neural Network being used for a lot of reallife applications with non-Euclidean real world data having graph structure. The major difference between CNN and GNN is that GNN is a generalized variant of CNN built to operate on irregular or non-Euclidean structured data whereas the CNN can function only in case wherethe underlying data is regular (Euclidean). GCN is developed by Thomas Kipf and MaxWelling[43] in 2016. Convolution in GCN is almost the same operation as the convolution in CNN. It implies multiplying the input neurons with a set of weights known as kernels or filters acts as sliding window and enables the network to learn features from neighbouring cells.Different layers may contain filters of different weights but within the same layer same filter will be used known as weight sharing. The particular variant of GCN that we use in our framework for semi-supervised classification is Spectral Graph Convolutional Network proposed by Thomas Kipf and Max Welling.",

To make our implementation better and effective the experiments are repeated for different volumes of labelled and unlabeled data samples. The performance scores and comparison of the proposed framework are listed in terms of F1measure, accuracy, recall and precision evaluation metrics. Analysis of the results is being done in numerical as well as in graphical representation using the shapes of accuracy-loss curves with epochs and area under the curve plots individually for each dataset. After initial pre-processing each dataset is split into 8:1:1 ratio for training, validation and testing respectively.

Word Mover's Distance is employed for constructing similarity graph utilizing Knearest neighbours for two different values of K i.e. K=3 and K=5. Graph convolutional network involves 4 layers convolutions for feature extraction with intermediate leaky ReLU activation and dropout layers. GCN of 4 layers is trained up to 120 epochs with dropout 0.5 , learning rate 0.01 , 16 hidden units and weight decay of 5^e-4 .
