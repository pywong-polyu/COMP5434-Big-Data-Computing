While several studies have explored this gender gap, none has attempted to isolate the psychological processes underpinning this phenomenon. In this research note, I suggest that sexism partly explains these differences. Using data from a large (N = 100,689) survey of American adults conducted between March and June 2020 by the Democracy Fund and the University of California, Los Angeles (Nationscape), I find that sexist beliefs, a component of masculine norms, are consistently the strongest predictor of coronavirusrelated emotions, behaviors, policy attitudes, and ultimately contracting COVID-19. This study highlights how gender ideology can impact health and impede government public health efforts.",

Belief in these gender norms is reflected in destructive health behaviors such as denial of weakness and vulnerability, dismissal of the need for help, hiding of disability or illness to avoid seeming feminine or weak (Charmaz 1995; Courtenay 2000; Levant et al. 2009; Yousaf, Popat, and Hunter 2015) , and support for a variety of related political outcomes (McDermott 2016) . 1 More importantly these health behaviors also serve to sustain and reproduce structures of power (Pyke 1996) . As with President Trump's refusal to wear a face mask in public and his criticism of Joe Biden for doing so, health behaviors can demonstrate masculine ideals that serve to reinforce the systematic subordination of women or \"weak\" men and preserve hierarchies of authority (McDermott 2016) .",

Together, these findings suggest that messaging around public health measures need to overcome barriers around the perceived \"masculinity\" of behaviors, as Representative Nancy Pelosi modeled during an interview with CNBC, when she remarked that \"real men wear masks.\" 4 While this study finds that sexist attitudes are strongly correlated with coronavirus behaviors and attitudes, it does little to dig into the proposed mechanism underlying this relationshipspecifically gendered personality or masculine norm adherence. Future work could use developed measures such as the Bem Sex Role Inventory to explore these relationships. Further, future work could leverage survey experiments to assess the role that elite messages or behaviors play in shaping perceptions of health behaviors as masculine or feminine and how those perceptions spill over into mass attitudes and behaviors.",
