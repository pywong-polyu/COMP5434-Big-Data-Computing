Thirtyeight patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy (CEA) for carotid stenosis in the Department of Neurovascular Surgery of the Second People's Hospital of Shenzhen from July 2019 to June 2020 were selected. Preoperatively, two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound scan was performed on all patients to assess the characteristics of the plaque and degree of stenosis, and CEUS was used to evaluate the surface morphology of the plaque and the distribution of neovascularization. Postoperatively, pathological sections and immunohistochemical analysis of CD147 and MMP-9 levels in the plaque were performed on the stripped plaque tissue, and the results were analyzed against the CEUS grading and pathological results. Among the 38 patients, pathological results showed that 10 and 28 were in the stable and vulnerable plaque groups, respectively. There were more smokers in the vulnerable plaque group than in the stable plaque group, with higher intraplaques CD147 and MMP-9. The difference in ultrasound plaque surface morphology grading and CEUS grading between the two groups was statistically significant. There was no significant difference in age, sex, incidence of complications such as hypertension, diabetes, and coronary heart disease between the two groups. CD147 was higher in the CEUS grade IV group than in the grades I (P = 0.040) and II (P = 0.010) groups. MMP-9 was higher in the CEUS grade IV group than in the grade II group (P = 0.017); MMP-9 was higher in the grade III group than in the grade II group (P = 0.015). Intraplaque contrast enhancement intensity was positively correlated with CD147 (r = 0.462, P = 0.003) and MMP-9 (r = 0.382, P = 0.018) levels. There was moderate consistency between the assessment of plaque vulnerability by 2D-ultrasound and by histopathological hematoxylin-eosin (HE) (kappa = 0.457, Frontiers in Computational Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org December 2021 | Volume 15 | Article 778946 Huang et al.",

There was a strong consistency between the assessment of plaque vulnerability by CEUS and histopathological HE (kappa = 0.671, P < 0.01). CEUS had a sensitivity of 89.2%, a specificity of 80.0%, a positive predictive value of 92.6%, a negative predictive value of 72.7%, and an accuracy of 86.8% for the diagnosis of vulnerable plaques; CEUS is a reliable, non-invasive test that can show the distribution of neovascularization within vulnerable plaques, evaluate the vulnerability and risk of intraplaque hemorrhage, with a high consistency with pathological findings. The degree of intraplaque enhancement and the levels of CD147 and MMP-9 in the tissue were positively correlated.",

Intra-plaque contrast was observed for 5 min. During the examination, the probe was fan-shaped and oscillated minutely to observe the enhancement of all areas of the plaque as much as possible. The abovementioned process was repeated after the contrast had been completely excreted, if necessary, to continue the observation. The video clips were stored as raw data. Prior to the examination, all patients were required to give informed consent for CEUS and have their blood pressure measured. After the examination, the patient was allowed to leave after blood pressure was measured to ensure normalcy and sitting still for 15 min under observation with no adverse effects. After the contrast agent was injected, if dotted or short linear microbubble hyperechoes moved in a linear pattern around or inside the plaque, it indicated the formation of neovascularization within the plaque. Grading was performed based on the enhancement characteristics of carotid atherosclerotic plaque angiography, and semiquantitative analysis of neovascularization was performed (Saha et al., 2016) : Grade I, no significant enhancement within the plaque; Grade II, enhancement at the base of the plaque; Grade III, enhancement at the base and shoulder of the plaque; and Grade IV, enhancement at the base, shoulder, and center of the plaque (Figure 2) . The results of grading according to the above criteria were used for ultrasound staging of carotid atherosclerotic plaque susceptibility according to the plaque surface morphology and microvessel grading: grades I and II were stable plaques, and grades III and IV were vulnerable plaques (Zhao et al., 2018) . When the plaque morphology and contrast enhancement grading of the same patient differed, the higher grade was considered.",

The screenshots were required to have tissue distribution over the entire field of view as much as possible, and the backlighting had to be consistent in each screenshot. Applying Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software, the criterion for judging all positive screenshots was that the microscopic display was the same tan color, and finally, each photo screenshot was analyzed and calculated to derive its positive cumulative optical density value and the area of tissue pixels within the glass section. The face density was calculated based on the above measurement data, and the formula was as follows: face density = cumulative optical density value/pixel area; the larger the face density value, the higher the level of positive expression in the tissue sections.",

Meanwhile, the 2D-ultrasound scoring results were tested for agreement with pathological evaluation of plaque vulnerability using histopathology as the gold standard (Table 5) , and the agreement between the 2D-ultrasound assessment of plaque vulnerability and histopathological HE assessment of plaque vulnerability was moderate (Kappa = 0. 457, P > 0. 05). The sensitivity of 2D-ultrasound in diagnosing vulnerable plaques was 85.7%, specificity 60%, positive predictive value 78%, negative predictive value 85.7%, and accuracy 60%. The results indicated that the accuracy of 2D-ultrasound in diagnosing vulnerable plaques was slightly lower than that of CEUS.",

Intraplaque hypoxia and local inflammation trigger intraplaque neovascularization. These vessels are devoid of smooth muscle cells and simply consist of endothelial cells (Doran et al., 2008) . Pathological neovascularization results in vessels that lack connective tissue and basement membrane, which make them more brittle and permeable, leading to lipid deposition and intraplaque hemorrhage (IPH). Intraplaque hemorrhage is the primary source of lipid nuclear expansion. Plaques with IPH are associated with rapid disease progression, recurrent bleeding, and other clinical events (Camare et al., 2017; Mura et al., 2020) .",

A large number of studies has confirmed that the degree of contrast enhancement of plaques correlates well with the microvasculardensity (MVD) of plaques with good specificity (Vavuranakis et al., 2013; Li et al., 2014) . Studies have shown that the inflow of small emboli into the blood is positively correlated with neovascularization in plaques (Ritter et al., 2013) . In this study, ultrasound was performed using conventionally and with contrast enhancement. In this study, plaque stability was assessed using conventional ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound, and histopathological findings were used as controls.

The structural integrity of the plaque's fibrous cap and the tolerance of external forces are mainly mediated by the extracellular matrix. MMP-9 is one of the main mediators of extracellular matrix degradation. Clinical as well as animal studies have confirmed that MMP-9 levels are increased in both peripheral blood and plaques in atherosclerosis, and the degree of increase is positively correlated with lesion severity (Lindsey et al., 2001; Cho and Reidy, 2002) . CD147 is a widely distributed transmembrane protein, also known as EMMPRIN, which induces MMP-9 expression and is a key mediator of inflammatory and immune responses; it has been correlated with intraplaque angiogenesis (Chen et al., 2009 ). According to Seizer et al. (2010) silencing CD147 with the siRNA gene effectively reduced the upregulation of monocyte-derived foam cells expressing MMP-9 and MTl-MMP, reducing matrix degradation and playing an important role in plaque stabilization. Xu et al. (2018) showed that patients with TIA and acute cerebral infarction had significantly higher serum CD147 levels; increased CD147 levels in vulnerable plaques compared with those in stable plaques, and serum CD147 levels were associated with increased risk of stroke following episodes of TIA. In this study, the expression of CD147 and MMP-9 factors in carotid plaques was examined at the molecular level, and the levels of both factors were higher in the histopathologically vulnerable plaque group than in the stable plaque group, which is consistent with previous studies. The levels of CD147 and MMP-9 were higher in the histopathologically vulnerable plaque group than in the stable plaque group. The stronger plaque CEUS enhancement represented more neovascularization, and neovascularizationrich plaques were more susceptible to bleeding and inflammatory responses and had higher intra-tissue CD147 and MMP-9 levels.",

The assessment of plaque stability by CEUS was also limited to patients who underwent carotid endarterectomy and could not be extrapolated to patients with carotid atherosclerotic plaques in general. Second, the use of lipid-lowering drugs may lead to a biased selection of study subjects, affecting the analysis of risk factors and possibly affecting the CD147 levels within the plaque.
