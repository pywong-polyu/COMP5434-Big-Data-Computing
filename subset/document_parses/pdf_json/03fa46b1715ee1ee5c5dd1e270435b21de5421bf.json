Deep brain stimulation is a reversible, adjustable neurosurgical procedure that has been gaining ground in psychiatry as a treatment for depression and obsessivecompulsive disorder, yet few studies have investigated AN. Abnormal eating behavior and the compulsive pursuit of thinness in AN is, in part, a consequence of dysfunction in reward circuitry and the nucleus accumbens (NAcc) is central to reward processing.",

Electrodes were implanted bilaterally into the NAcc with stimulation at the anterior limb of the internal capsule using rechargeable implantable pulse generators. The protocol of 15 months included 12 months of deep brain stimulation incorporating two consecutive, randomized blind on-off fortnights 9 months after stimulation onset. The primary objectives were to investigate safety and feasibility, together with changes in eating disorder psychopathology.",

Three patients responded to treatment [defined as > 35% reduction in Eating Disorders Examination (EDE) score at 12 months] and four patients were non-responders. Responders had a statistically significant mean reduction in EDE scores (50.3% reduction; 95% CI 2.6-98.2%), Clinical Impairment Assessment (45.6% reduction; 95% CI 7.4-83.7%). Responders also had a statistically significant mean reduction in Hamilton Depression Scale, Hamilton Anxiety Scale and Snaith-Hamilton pleasure scale. There were no statistically significant changes in Body Mass Index, Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale, Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and World Health Organization Quality of Life Psychological subscale. Frontiers in Behavioral Neuroscience | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 16 | Article 842184 Scaife et al. DBS in SE-AN Pilot Study Conclusion: This study provides some preliminary indication that deep brain stimulation to the NAcc. Might potentially improve some key features of enduring AN. In this small study, the three responders had comorbid obsessive-compulsive disorder which predated AN diagnosis. Future studies should aim to further elucidate predictors of outcome.

The prognosis is poor: around one third of individuals develop severe and enduring AN (Arcelus et al., 2011) . There is a huge need for novel treatments for patients who have found no beneficial psychological or pharmacological treatment (Crow et al., 2009; Balestrieri et al., 2013; Watson and Bulik, 2013; Hay et al., 2021) . Neurosurgical interventions may offer a solution but must meet ethically high standards and should be reversible unlike some proposed lesion treatments (Park et al., 2017; Pugh et al., 2018; Pugh, 2019) . Deep brain stimulation is a reversible, adjustable and invasive neurosurgical procedure, in which electrodes are inserted into specific neural targets. Originally developed by Heath for use in psychiatric disorders (O'Neal et al., 2017) and later pain (Hosobuchi et al., 1977; Richardson and Akil, 1977) , its main use currently is for movement disorders (Krack et al., 2019) . More recently, its use in psychiatric disorders has enjoyed a renaissance (Cleary et al., 2015; Graat et al., 2017) : obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (de Haan et al., 2017; Bergfeld et al., 2021) and it has been used in depression (Malone et al., 2009; Bewernick et al., 2010) and addiction (Wang et al., 2018; Vannemreddy and Slavin, 2019) . Most studies targeted the ventral striatum (VS)/nucleus accumbens (NAcc) (Malone et al., 2009; Bewernick et al., 2010) and subcallosal cingulate (Lozano et al., 2008 (Lozano et al., , 2012 Lipsman et al., 2017) .",

Given the paucity of effective treatments for severe AN there is growing interest in the use of brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial magnetic stimulation, transcranial direct current stimulation and deep brain stimulation as possible treatments (Lozano et al., 2019; Duriez et al., 2020) . There have been only a handful of prior studies of deep brain stimulation in AN. Lipsman et al. (2017) targeted the subcallosal cingulate with a 50% response rate at 1 year (Lipsman et al., 2017) and no further improvements at 3 years follow-up with a focus on body mass index (BMI) as a measure of \"recovery.\" Two recent deep-brain stimulation (DBS) case series targeted the NAcc (Liu et al., 2020; Villalba Mart\u00ednez et al., 2020) and both focused on BMI as a primary outcome measure. Neither of these two studies reports on eating disorder psychopathology and no prior study in AN has included a blind on vs. off period, making it impossible to establish changes in eating disorder psychopathology, or if any effects are a genuine attributable to DBS.",

Secondary aims of the study were to assess the effect of DBS to the NAcc on core eating disorder psychopathology, assessed using the current gold standard semi structured interview Eating Disorder Examination (EDE) , together with The Clinical Impairment Assessment CIA (Bohn et al., 2008) , the Yale-Brown-Cornell Eating Disorder Scale: (YBC-EDS) (Mazure et al., 1994) and BMI. Food preference was also assessed behaviorally, using the Leeds food preference questionnaire (Finlayson et al., 2007; Cowdrey et al., 2013) . Separate measures of liking (hedonic pleasure) and explicit wanting (incentive salience) were assessed by using food stimuli varying along the dimensions of calorie content (high or low) and taste (savory or sweet). Explicit wanting and liking were assessed using 100 mm VAS scales, responding to the questions \"How much do you want some of this food now? \" and \"How pleasant would it be to experience the taste of this food now?\", respectively. Implicit wanting was indexed using reaction times to a behavioral forced-choice component of the task.",

In this pilot study of deep brain stimulation to the NAcc, in severe AN, three patients responded, with statistically significant reduction in EDE and CIA scores, and four did not. Bearing in mind that these patients had severe and enduring anorexia, had failed all other interventions and been severely impaired by disease for the majority of their adult lives, this is scientifically and clinically remarkable. Perhaps most importantly, this intervention was described as life changing by the responder group and their families. Interestingly, two of the responders showed changes in their food preferences, shifting away from a maladaptive preference for low fat foods toward a more adaptive preference for energy dense foods. However, no participants experienced over eating binges or the urge to binge, and in general, individuals felt more, rather than less, in control of their eating choices. Of course, the underlying drivers of variability between responders and non-responders cannot be fully established from this small pilot study. Despite sharing the same diagnosis of SE-AN, the participants differ in multiple ways, for example age, duration of illness and psychiatric comorbidities. However, our results do give some clues on what may predict response, and raise important questions for further investigation.",

It is notable that in the three responders, OCD diagnosis in childhood pre-dated the onset of AN, whereas the non-responders did not report a premorbid childhood onset OCD. Plausibly, it may be that the DBS impacted primarily on the OCD/compulsivity neural circuits on which their AN thrived. This may have permitted the dwindling of AN pathology, increasing flexibility and their ability to engage with treatment for AN.

In this study, the two aforementioned participants were notably unable to tolerate stimulation above 3.5V (6) and 3.75 V (3) due to side effects. Whilst it is possible that this might have hampered their response, others who were stimulated at higher voltages also failed to respond (see Table 2 for full details of stimulator settings). Indeed, Ramasubbu et al. (2018) concluded that the locus of stimulation is more important than stimulation intensity in determining treatment response of DBS for treatment resistant depression. The authors found no significant difference in mean stimulation parameters between responders and non-responders, suggesting optimal intensity is likely to be highly individualized.",

These factors all confound using BMI as an index of recovery, which can be artificially conflated by refeeding and mask underlying psychopathology. We chose not to use BMI as the sole primary outcome because it is a poor reflection of shifts in eating disorder psychopathology; for example, the onset of binge eating, or admission into inpatient refeeding programs, may increase BMI, but can leave core eating disorder pathology and the urge to restrict unchanged and sometimes even worsened. For example, patient 3 had a BMI of 18 as a result of being in inpatient weight restoration, yet had extremely high levels of eating disorder and OCD pathology and was unable to eat outside an inpatient setting. That said, we do not discount the importance of BMI on overall outcome and eventual recovery. Full recovery after many years AN, is likely to be gradual and take time. We predict BMI should improve in responders as a longer term effects of DBS reductions in eating disorder psychopathology. At the end of the 12 months stimulation period, BMI was not significantly increased compared to baseline in the responder group. While weight restoration does not necessarily define recovery from AN, it is possible that nutritional status and intensive support with concurrent weight restoration be advised in future studies of DBS/neuromodulation, to optimize the chance of weight gain.",

This suggests a genuine stimulation effect in these participants. The on/off stimulation month coincided with a personally difficult month for patient 6, which might have masked any genuine changes. To our knowledge this is the first double-blind DBS protocol in AN, although there have been several prior double-blind studies in OCD (Denys et al., 2010; de Haan et al., 2017; Tyagi et al., 2019) . In an open-label study, obsessive/compulsive symptoms recurred when stimulation was switched off (McLaughlin et al., 2013) . ",

Research in AN is hampered by a scarcity of DBS studies and the complexity of clinical presentation, including numerous comorbidities. Recent evidence suggests proactive inhibition (Bartholdy et al., 2017) which is impaired in OCD in line with severity, is altered by NAcc DBS in OCD patients (Sildatke et al., 2021) . Given responsiveness in those comorbid early onset OCD, proactive motor inhibition may be an underlying mechanism worthy of investigation in future AN studies As more research is undertaken and the neural circuitry underpinning AN is further characterized as it has been in OCD and depression, a more personalized and symptombased approach will be possible. Furthermore, with these advancements, we may be able to stimulate or perturb neural networks rather than individual areas. Closed-loop DBS systems simultaneously record and stimulate neural activity, allowing the stimulation to be adjusted according to disease-specific neural biomarkers with possible integration of multiple feedback sites and artificial intelligence to fine-tune programming (Krauss et al., 2021 ). An important recent development in DBS technology are electrodes with multiple independently controllable contacts (Weerasinghe et al., 2021) . This has been used successfully in a case study using closed-loop neuromodulation to treat an individual with chronic depression. They implanted a chronic deep brain sensing and stimulation device and implemented a biomarker-driven closed-loop therapy which was triggered when symptoms were elevated (Scangos et al., 2021) . In future, a top-down, non-invasive approach, which targets cortical regions may be taken instead. In OCD, abnormal beta-gamma neurophysiology of the orbitofrontal-striatal circuitry is observed during reward processing. Top-down stimulation using transcranial direct current stimulation targeting the orbitofrontal cortex improves OCD symptomatology (Grover et al., 2021) .",

Although the study is limited by small sample size its strength is in detailed longitudinal data on all aspects of eating psychopathology and comorbid symptoms. We found that patients with premorbid early onset OCD prior to AN onset appear to benefit the most from DBS. For them it was experienced as a game-changing intervention. In contrast, all non-responders had a later onset of AN over the age of 18, and only one had comorbid OCD which was also of later onset. Differences in underlying neural circuitry and or electrode placement may also contribute to lack of response to DBS. Concurrent engagement in intensive weight restoration program is advisable to accompany and facilitate DBS induced neurogenesis and change. All patients are in active follow-up and all elected to continue DBS over the next 3 years to establish future course. It remains possible non-responders may yet show improvement during the longer term.",
