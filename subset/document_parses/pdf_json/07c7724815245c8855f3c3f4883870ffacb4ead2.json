This is an alarming situation as with a huge population within few days India will enter in stage-3 of COVID-19 transmission. In the absence of neither an effective treatment or vaccine and with an incomplete understanding of the epidemiological cycle, predictive mathematical models can help exploring of both COVID-19 transmission and control. In this present study, we consider a new mathematical model on COVID-19 transmission that incorporate lock-down effect and variability in transmission between symptomatic and asymptomatic populations with former being a fast spreader of the disease. Using daily COVID-19 notified cases from three states (Maharashtra, Delhi, and Telangana) and overall India, we assess the effect of current 21 days lock-down in terms of reduction cases and deaths. Lock-down effect is studied with different lock-down success rate. Our result suggest that 21 days lock-down will have no impact in Maharashtra and overall India. Furthermore, the presence of a higher percentage of COVID-19 superspreaders will further deteriorate the situation in Maharashtra. However, for Tamil Nadu and Delhi there is some ray of hope as our prediction shows that lock-down will reduce a significant number of cases and deaths. in these two locations. Further extension of lock-down may place Delhi and Tamil Nadu in a comfort zone. Comparing estimated parameter samples for the mentioned four locations, we find a correlation between effect of lockdown and percentage of symptomatic infected in a region. Our result suggests that a higher percentage of symptomatic infected in a region leads to a large number of reduction in notified cases and deaths due to different lock-down scenario.

Coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positivesense RNA viruses that belongto the Coronaviridae family and the order Nidovirales, and are widely distributed among humans and other mammals [20] . The novel coronavirus, COVID-19 started in mainland China, with a geographical emphasis at Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province [30] and has widely spread all over the world. Many of the initial cases were usually introduced to the wholesale Huanan seafood market, which also traded live animals. Clinical trials of hospitalized patients found that patients exhibit symptoms consistent with viral pneumonia at the onset of COVID-19, most commonly fever, cough, sore throat and fatigue [3] . Some patients reported changes in their ground-glass lungs; normal or lower than average white lymphocyte blood cell counts and platelet counts; hypoxemia; and deranged liver and kidney function. Most were said to be geographically related to the wholesale market of Huanan seafood [2] . Severe outbreaks occur in USA (3,67,004 cases), Italy (1,32,547 cases), Spain (1,36,675 cases), Germany (103,375 cases), France(98,010), China (81,708 cases) and so many countries and the disease continues to spread globally.

In our model, we also considered transmission variability between symptomatic and asymptomatic population with former being a fast spreader of the disease. Using daily notified cases from three states (Maharashtra, Delhi, and Tamil Nadu) and form whole India, we studied the effect of 21 days lock-down (25/03/2020 till 14/04/2020) on notified cases and deaths reduction in those regions. Our result suggest that Lock-down will have no effect in Maharashtra and overall India. Furthermore, presence of higher percentage of COVID-19 super-spreaders will further deteriorate the situation in Maharashtra. However, for Delhi and Tamil Nadu there is some ray of hope as our prediction shows that lock-down will reduce significant number of notified cases and deaths in these two locations. Further extension of lock-down may place Delhi and Tamil Nadu in a comfort zone. To find the answer of the question why lock-down have some effect in Delhi and Tamil Nadu but no effect on overall India and Maharashtra? We closely look at the parameters sample table for these four locations (see Table B1 ) and found that in Tamil Nadu and Delhi there is a large percentage of symptomatic infected exists in the population. Whereas, in Maharashtra and overall India percentage of symptomatic infected population is very low (see Table B1 ). Thus, there may be a possibility that larger proportion of symptomatic infected in a population can help epidemic curve to reach its peak quickly. To further investigate our claim, we simulate new notified cases for these four locations with mentioned prediction period without any lock-down (see Fig 15) . It can be easily seen from Fig 15, that in Delhi and Tamil-Nadu notified new cases reaches the epidemic peak and whereas for Maharashtra and overall India notified cases slowly increases and still increasing during the mentioned time duration. As new notified cases in Delhi and Tamil Nadu grow faster therefore, 21 days lock-down has some significant impact in reducing cases and deaths in these two locations. Thus, 21 days lock-down may be effective in reducing significant amount of cases and deaths in those location in India where percentage of symptomatic infected population is higher.
