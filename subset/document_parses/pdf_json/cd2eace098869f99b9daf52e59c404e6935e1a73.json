The prevalence of co-infection and secondary infection in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 is not well understood. Aims: To investigate the role of co-infections and secondary infections in disease severity of hospitalized individuals with COVID-19. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was carried out between 11 January 2020 and 1 March 2020 among 408 laboratory confirmed COVID-19 patients in China. These patients were divided into three groups based on disease severity: mild or moderate, severe, or critically ill. Microbiological pathogens in blood, urine, and respiratory tract specimens were detected by the combination of culture, serology, polymerase chain reaction, and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (mNGS). Results: The median age of participants was 48 years (IQR 34-60 years). Fifty-two patients (12.7%) had at least one additional pathogen, 8.1% were co-infected, and 5.1% had a secondary infection. There were 13 Mycoplasma pneumoniae cases, 8",

            "text": "Co-infections were common in community-acquired pneumonia patients. 22 Regarding COVID-19, we do not know whether SARS-CoV-2 could outcompete other respiratory pathogens. In the first two studies in China on 41 and 99 COVID-19 patients, no positive results had been reported though several common community-acquired pathogens had been detected. 1, 23 Recently, Lansbury et al. reported 1%-20% of bacterial co-infection in China, and summarized pooled population of 1014 patients with an estimated 3% (95% CI: 1%-6%) of viral co-infection. 24 Bacterial co-infection was reported in 4.9% (95% CI: 2.6%-7.1%) of COVID-19 patients from latest updates by the Toronto Antimicrobial Resistance Research Network (TARRN) website (https://www.tarrn.org/ covid). Our results are concordant with the above-mentioned reports, as 8.1% of the patients had viral and bacterial coinfection. We found co-infections of common communityacquired pathogens (including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, RSV and influenza viruses, Haemophilus influenzae, and Streptococcus pneumoniae) mainly in mild and moderate patients (9.1%, Table 2 ). These results suggested that coinfections should not be ignored in COVID-19 patients and the screening of such infections at admission should be strengthened. A latest study reported hospital-acquired infection in 4.7% of COVID-19 patients, 25 which is comparable to 5.1% of secondary infection in our cohort. Although previous studies had estimated a prevalence of bacterial and fungal secondary infections as from 4% to 14.3% in COVID-19 patients. 1, 25, 26 It is noteworthy that the etiological results could be influenced by different diagnostic method and specimens types used in the studies, as well as seasonal factor. Here, benefit from the utility of culture, PCR, and mNGS, more pathogens were able to be detected, including anaerobic bacteria in blood, and HSV-1 in blood and BAL specimens (HSV-1 could be reactivated in critical care patients and cause ventilator-associated pneumonia. 27 Our results also show that a total of 60 patients have received antibiotic treatment, including 26 of patients without any additional pathogen detections ( Table 1) . As antibiotics likely provide limited benefit on COVID-19 treatment and contribute to the development of drug tolerance and resistance and other adverse consequences, 26 it is necessary to detect bacterial infections in the context of COVID-19 which may provide more implications for antibiotic stewardship. Most secondary infections occurred in critically ill patients. The possible underlying reason may be that most critically ill patients were associated with longer invasive ventilation which could provide the increased chance for hospitalacquired infections. 28, 29 Although the physicians prescribed sensitive antifungal (Voriconazole) for treatment, the two patients still died, indicating that the fatality of the patients with fungal secondary infection was relatively high. These two patients had received methylprednisolone for 6 days (60 mg for 3 days, followed by 40 mg for 3 days), 2-3 days before positive results of filamentous fungi culture. It has been reported that filamentous fungal infections in viral pneumonia may be related to corticoid use. 30 Thus, further research on the relationship between corticosteroid treatment and the risk of filamentous fungal infections may be warranted in a large number of COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Limitations to this study exist, which the authors have tried to minimize. First, this is a retrospective study of patients infected with COVID-19 and as such, our sample was likely imbalanced between the study arms. However, the Shenzhen Third People's Hospital is the only governmentmandated hospital for the treatment of COVID-19 patients in the region. As such, patients presenting to the hospital would likely be representative of other infected patients. Additional analysis with a larger cohort could help to improve the analysis conducted and further provide insights into the impact of co-infections on the progression of COVID-19. Second, given the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, not all of patients received the same microbiological testing. The testing depended on the physician's decision, which could produce bias in that positive results are more likely to be obtained from clinically suspected patients. Similarly, we only detected the three most common respiratory viruses in patients; other respiratory viruses (e.g., adenovirus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, etc) were not included. Therefore, the co-infection rate of bacteria and respiratory viruses would be underestimated to some extent. Third, the numbers in determining mNGS compared to standard culture methods is too low to make any definitive conclusions, so this part of the study is descriptive only. Furthermore, the use of IgM/IgG to support diagnosis of Mycoplasma infection has been shown in other research to overestimate the number of true cases, which may have biased our results. Additionally, follow-up testing of samples or comparative analyses to similar patients in China would add further support to our findings.",

In the small number of cases observed, fungal secondary infections associated with fatal cases are presented. Surveillance for common respiratory pathogens in those with COVID-19 will be helpful to protect against co-infections and secondary infections and provide suggestions for antimicrobial stewardship and hospital infection control.",
