This enveloped virus has positive-sense RNA and belongs to the Coronaviridae family. On 12 January 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) named this new virus the \"2019-novel coronavirus\" (2019-nCoV). 1 The primary cases in Iran were reported in Qom in February 2020, and shortly, positive cases increased rapidly everywhere in Iran. 2 The clinical manifestations of this infection have a good range and typically include impairment of smell, taste disturbance, cough, fever, and shortness of breath. 3 There has been a growing appreciation of the importance of digestive symptoms (nausea, vomiting, anorexia, non-bloody diarrhea, and abdominal pain) within the spectrum of COVID-19 disease. Also, abnormalities in coagulation markers have been reported in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. 4 Coagulopathy is one of the foremost significant prognostic factors in patients with COVID-19 and is related to increased mortality and admission to critical care. 5 In severe cases of COVID-19, SARS-CoV-2 induces a cytokine storm that ultimately leads to impaired pulmonary gas exchange and acti-vation of the coagulation cascade, causing thrombotic manifestations 6 and median plasma concentrations of tissue factor and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) reported to be significantly higher in patients withAcute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (at 7 days) compared with patients without ARDS (data not from COVID-19 patients). 7 These and other changes increase coagulation status in patients with COVID 19.",

He stated that the pain worsened with movement and change in position. He denied any significant family history of the disease. During the physical examination, the patient was diaphoretic, uncomfortable, and in severe distress. His vital signs were: blood pressure, 156/87 mm Hg; respiratory rate, 19 breaths/minute; heart rate, 132 beats/minute; and temperature within normal limits. Oxygen saturation was 93% on room air. The abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen that was severely tender to palpation. Intravenous (IV) fluids were immediately started for the patient. He was also given IV ondansetron for nausea. His pain was refractory to treatment and required multiple doses of morphine sulfate. Laboratory evaluation revealed leukocytosis with a white blood cell (WBC) count of 14.5 thou/cm. He underwent laparotomy due to tenderness in favor of acute abdominal pain. During laparotomy, not only the small and large intestine but also their vasculature was normal. After two days, the patient was discharged with no pain and symptom. With nausea, abdominal pain, and dyspnea, he came back to the ER again after 3 days. On examination, he had tachypnea (RR: 40/ min), tachycardia (HR: 120/min), low-grade fever (Temp: 38\u00b0centigrade). A lung computed tomography (CT) (Figure 1 ) and an abdominopelvic CT ( Figure 2 ) were done. The patient was intubated due to respiratory failure.

There are several reasons why the hypercoagulable state increases in patients with COVID-19 disease. For example, the direct effects of COVID-19 or the indirect effects of infection, like through severe illness and hypoxia, may predispose patients to thrombotic events. Preliminary reports suggest that hemostatic abnormalities, including disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), occur in patients suffering from COVID-19. 16 Additionally, the severe inflammatory response, critical illness, and underlying traditional risk factors may all predispose to thrombotic events, indicate thatcoagulation activation due to infection/sepsis, cytokine storm, and imminent organ failure. Studies have shown higher D-dimer level, fibrin degradation product, and prolonged PT on admission correlated with decreased survival in patients hospitalized for COVID-19 pneumonia, with 71.4% of patients who died developed overt DIC 17 and in the 18% of patients admitted to ICU for COVID-19-associated acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) thrombotic complications were happened.despite anticoagulation therapy, in 16.7%; COVID-19-related to ARDS associated withPE increased thrombotic complications, especially compared to non-COVID-19-associated ARDS. 18 However, the important thing is thatCOVID-19 may predispose patients to both venous and arterial thromboembolic disease due to excessive inflammation, hypoxia, immobilization, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). 19 Patients with COVID 19 are reported to have vascular events; for example, Avila and co-workers reported four patients presenting with imaging that confirmed acute strokes and PCR results that confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. 20 Coagulopathy, antiphospholipid antibodies, and multiple cerebral infarctions were detected in two men (69 and 70 years old) and one woman (65 years old) admitted to ICU for COVID-19 in a case series. 21 Our patient had mesenteric vascular thrombosis and suffered from small bowel ischemia. In our review, this is the first report of this demonstration.",
