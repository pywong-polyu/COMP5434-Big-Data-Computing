Consequently, boys who dance are viewed as effeminate, homosexual, and not real men [5] . Some authors acknowledge that there are greater manifestations of sexual prejudice when masculinity is threatened [6] . The existence of negative attitudes, encapsulated in prejudice, will likely influence individuals not to perform specific behaviors [7] [8] [9] . This is the case of prejudice towards dance and, particularly, towards boys who dance, which has been identified as an inhibitor for children and adolescents to join dance activities [10] . Due to the negative attitudes embedded in such prejudice, young people may miss the opportunity to seize the different health benefits of a physical fitness program achieved through dance [11] [12] [13] [14] . The development of positive attitudes will likely impact the willingness to participate in some physical activities, as is the case of dance [15, 16] .",

Particularly, the prejudice towards boys who dance tends to be more expressive between the ages of 11 and 16 years old [19] . It has been considered that changing attitudes is easier in earlier stages of development, and for this reason, childhood is regarded as an important period to prevent and fight prejudice [20, 21] . Adolescence is also an important stage to develop positive attitudes [22] , and it is a period of life when it is possible to change attitudes, when social relationships are used as influencers [17] . Therefore, children and adolescents are important targets for interventions aiming at fighting prejudice by changing attitudes and behaviors [23] , particularly through Social Marketing Interventions [24] . There are indications that age and development effects reduce from childhood to adolescence, inasmuch that they are replaced by social influences [18, 22, 25] . Therefore, age-related differences should be integrated into the analysis [17, 18, 23] .",

The key objective of this module was to promote learning from activity-based experience and increase self-efficacy [52, 54] , through the experimentation of dance and, with it, to raise awareness to dance as physical activity. At the end of each module, participants were asked to fill a control form to assess the awareness of the condition they were exposed to, to guarantee that those who reported having participated indeed did it and to collect preliminary feedback on the SMI. Regarding the dance experimentation, the majority of participants (75.00%), both children (75.58%) and adolescents (74.62%) considered hip hop their preferred style. Although ballet was chosen as the second preferred style by the participants (10.55%), when we analyzed only the boys' preferences, ballet was on the bottom of the list. This is consistent with research that indicates that some dance styles are more associated with a normative view of masculinity, and for this reason, they are more appealing to boys [1] . After being exposed to some components of the intervention, however, 93.12% of the participants agreed that ballet can be practiced by both boys and girls, an even greater percentage than those who consider the same for hip hop (92.20%).",

Specifically, children predominantly attend the school's 2nd cycle and are aged between 10 and 12 years old; adolescents are enrolled in the school's 3rd cycle and are aged between 13 and 16 years old [56, 57] . This classification is based on the PedsQLTM (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory), which distinguishes children, aged from 8 to 12 years old, from adolescents, aged from 13 to 18 years old [56, 58, 59] . Thus, each school's cycle incorporates more homogeneous individuals in terms of development, and for this reason, the authors did not use the direct age of the participants to compare children and adolescents.

The other constructs were considered using a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 = \"Strongly Disagree\" to 5 = \"Strongly Agree\". The attitude towards boys who dance (Attb) was measured using 14 items adapted from Sanderson [19] (e.g., \"When I see a boy dancing, I consider it a stupid situation\"; \"Boys should not practice dance\"; \"I don't like to see guys expressing dance moves\"). The subjective norms (SN) included 11 items derived and adapted from David and Rundle-Thiele's [66] scale (e.g., \"People who are important to me consider that boys should not practice dance\"; \"People who are important to me consider that boys who dance are effeminate\"; \"People who are important to me approve if I decide to choose dance as an activity for me to practice\"). The perceived behavior control (PBC) comprised three items derived and adapted from the same scale (e.g., \"If I want, I can choose dance practice\"; \"If I want, I can start to dance next month\"). The last construct, the intention to join dance activities (INT), was measured from three items also derived and adapted from David and Rundle-Thiele's [66] scale (e.g., \"I intend to start practicing dance next school year\"; \"I will seek to participate in dance activities next school year\").",

The authors further tested the internal consistency of the scales for the entire pre-test sample (before SMI) and each of the groups (control and experimental), repeating the procedure for the post-test sample (after SMI), to verify the consistency of the measures in reflecting the same underlying construct. The results ( Table 2 ) indicate a good internal consistency of the measures, with the estimates exceeding the recommended threshold of 0.70 [68] , which is in line with previous studies [66, 67] . Only the construct subjective norms (SN) presented alphas slightly below the cut-off limit of 0.70 (from 0.568 to 0.719), as in the study by David and Rundle-Thiele [66] in which the alpha of SN was 0.66. The obtained alphas for SN are close to or above 0.60, which deemed an acceptable value for exploratory research [68] . Therefore, the authors decided to proceed with the analysis, even because the alphas of the entire scale were significantly above the thresholds, supporting the assertion of the internal consistency of the measures in different samples and moments. As the primary goal of the study is to evaluate changes in children's and adolescents' perceptions before and after the SMI, and to compare the effects between these two groups, the analysis relied on paired t-tests and independent t-tests using the composite variables calculated as the means of the observable variables of each construct, similarly to previous research [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] .",

The results indicate that the p-value is lower than 0.05 for both tests, which means that the data does not follow a normal distribution [75, 76] . However, as in social sciences a certain deviation from normality is acceptable [77] , despite the results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test and the Shapiro-Wilk Test, skewness' values between \u00b1 2/3, and kurtosis between \u00b17/10 are accepted [78] . Therefore, the authors performed the Skewness and Kurtosis tests, and all data are within the normality, since the higher values for the skewness of the experimental and control groups were \u22121.218 and \u22121.403, respectively, and for kurtosis of the experimental and control groups were 5.401 and 2.039, respectively. For these reasons, these values are considered acceptable to prove normal univariate distribution [78] . The results indicate that parametric tests can be used [79] . The literature stresses the advantages of using parametric tests (e.g., ability to control the Type I error rate and greater statistical power) instead of using the non-parametric tests [80] . Thus, the parametric tests were performed in this research.",

In the case of adolescents, although with lower expression, the intervention also affected the attitudes towards dance. As expected, adolescents' intention to join dance activities was significantly improved, but not that of children's, possibly because adolescents are more independent in their decisions than children [1, [41] [42] [43] . Although it was only statistically significant for three variables in the children's group and two variables in the adolescents' group, this result offers a relevant contribution to support the argument of the effectiveness of the SMI.

Thus, the authors accepted H1, which suggested that attitudes toward dance would be different after the intervention and this difference, reflecting more positive attitudes, would be greater in children than in adolescents. Second, the SMI had a significant impact on children's subjective norms, although not on the adolescents', who significantly differ from children regarding this variable. Although both children's and adolescents' subjective norms had higher scores after the SMI, this change was significantly greater in children, as predicted, leading to accepting H3. Peer pressure may have had an important role here, as it is stronger in adolescence [19, 33, 34] .",

These results are interesting because they show that, despite the different effects that the SMI had on these two age development groups when analyzed in isolation, and despite the inherent differences these two targets might have, regarding some of the variables they did not differ substantially. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that children and adolescents seem to have some commonalities that would lead them to respond similarly to some of the stimuli of the SMI. However, the identified differences provide indications that an SMI with the purpose of the one used in the research may need to be adapted to the two different targets, so as to increase its effectiveness. This adaptation may be justified since not only the prejudice tends to have different expression in different ages and there is evidence that it is easier to change attitudes in earlier stages of development [20, 21, 30] , but also the information processing and stimuli response change throughout childhood and adolescence [82] , posing challenges to a standardized SMI for all children.",

            "text": "This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effect of an SMI on children's and adolescents' perceptions of dance as physical activity and the differences between these two age development groups, assessed in the light of the TPB framework. The results of this study allow drawing two relevant conclusions. First, all the five variables analyzed scored higher after the SMI. Although only three were statistically different in the case of children, and two in the case of adolescents, both groups have in common the fact that they were significantly affected in their perception of dance as physical activity. Moreover, children's perceptions of boys who dance were significantly more positive after the SMI. This is a relevant implication of the study, adding evidence of the power of social marketing to tackle social problems, particularly prejudice, which has been advocated by several authors [24, 27, 83, 84] . The use of social marketing tools to fight prejudice towards dance as physical activity and towards boys who dance is an opportunity to accomplish this purpose, while also allowing to analyze the role of the SMIs outside the health field, where it has been most often applied [26, 27, 83, 85] . Second, when the differences between the SMI effects on the children's and adolescents' groups are explored, it was concluded that they had similarities but also significant differences. These mixed results suggest that an SMI that is more adapted to the different targets may be beneficial. This study contributes to the work of educators and policymakers by suggesting that prejudice regarding some physical activities should be tackled differently at different ages and that earlier ages are more susceptible to change attitudes. Yet, future research should include younger children than those who participated in this study, to further explore this conclusion.",

For example, this study did not make an in-depth approach to the parents' influence. However, the literature suggests that parents, specifically, fathers, are an important influence on the normative beliefs and, particularly, on the type of prejudice addressed by this research [4, [86] [87] [88] . It was found that the subjective norms of children were affected by the SMI, but not those of adolescents. Thus, it would be relevant to explore whether fathers have a greater influence on adolescents' subjective norms about boys who dance. Parents were not targeted in this study, but future studies may also include them as a target for a specific SMI, to explore this influence on the adolescents' perceived support.",

The use of the term \"sport\" instead of \"art\" to categorize the dance activity has been presented as an attempt to attract more male practitioners [89] . In this context, schools may also have an important role. The fact that most schools do not promote dance activities as a school sport or in physical education classes has a strong influence on children's and adolescents' preferences and choices [1, 90] . Additionally, the way dance, and particularly boys who dance, are seen within different cultural contexts may also be important to consider, as culture plays an important role in the development and persistence of prejudice [91] . Attitudes towards boys who dance are rooted in social and cultural beliefs about gender roles regarding some activities [10, 92, 93] . This study was developed in a Western culture country, where sports are predominantly associated with football, which was historically stereotyped as a male activity [94, 95] , and dance is viewed as a feminine cultural practice [96] . Thus, a cross-cultural study could be relevant to assess such influences.",

For example, concepts such as perceived self-efficacy, which is influenced by socio-structural factors-consisting of economic conditions, socioeconomic status, educational structure, and family status-may indirectly influence behavioral effects [97] . These factors were not included in this study, but they might be relevant to understand the SMI effectiveness. Finally, some variables could not be controlled using the research design that was implemented, particularly when targeting young people and involving activity-based experience within the online environment used for the implementation. This limited control may help explain some differences found in the control group. Thus, implementing the designed intervention in a face-to-face context may also be necessary to compare the levels of SMI effectiveness, considering the implementation medium.",
