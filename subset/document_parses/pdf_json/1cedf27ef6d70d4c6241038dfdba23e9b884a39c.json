It is an opportunistic pathogen that usually infects patients in intensive care units. It is seen as a global public health threat due to its ability to survive for months in dry environments, to be resistant to disinfectants, to form biofilms, and to develop multi-antibiotic resistance [18, 19] . In our study, when we examined those patients who reproduced Acinetobacter baumannii in detail to understand what caused the increase during the pandemic, it was found that the first Acinetobacter baumannii-breeding patient of the year was taken to external ventricular drainage in the operating room and then it was produced in the blood culture taken. In another patient with Acinetobacter baumannii growth, a gastrostomy was done in the operating room and then it was found that Acinetobacter baumannii developed in two more patients. We confirmed that there was an Acinetobacter baumannii epidemic in the operating room at the same time. It was discovered that another patient who had Acinetobacter baumannii was transferred from another service. The reason for the increase in the prevalence of Acinetobacter baumannii was thought to be related to patients in the operating room. However, we would expect a decrease in Acinetobacter baumannii infection, as the incidence of Klebsiella pneumoniae was reduced and VRE was not seen at all, with the meticulous implementation of the standard precautions we saw in our staff. We speculate that standard measures may be insufficient to prevent the spread of Acinetobacter baumannii, and therefore, additional emergency preventions should be sought.",

Compliance with hand hygiene was found to be as high as 99.44% in our clinic during the pandemic compared to before. During the pandemic, a significant decrease was detected in the rate of hospital infections that pose a threat to public health compared to that prior to the pandemic. Therefore, this study is important in terms of showing that the spread of bacteria such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, VRE, and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, which are an important public health threat, can be decreased by applying simple standard methods, and it is understood that increased training should be continued even when the pandemic is over.",
