We develop a theory and hypotheses about the impact of citizens' experiences on their perceptions of the government's effectiveness during times of crisis. We do so with data collected at two points in time: in late March 2020 during the first peak of the Covid-19 crisis in Israel, and in October 2020 when Israel was exiting from a second lockdown. The findings demonstrate that during crises citizens focus on the short term and seek immediate results in terms of readiness and preparedness. During such times, the government's responsiveness and transparency, as well as the public's participation in decisions, seem even more important than their trust in the government. Implications and practical recommendations follow.",

Once again, it made clear that trust between governments and the people is vital to the functioning of our modern society (Robinson et al., 2020) . The legitimacy of government to make and implement effective policies that minimize the damage to the democratic system, its economy and public health is strongly related to the attitudes of citizens towards these policies. This study focuses on these attitudes and suggests a model that may help us explain perceptions about the government's effectiveness during a crisis.",

We suggest that citizens' evaluations of the government's response to such crises are crucial for building trust between the players, which later promotes the willingness to comply with and participate in government efforts to handle the issues that the crises bring in their wake Robinson et al., 2020) . Hence, our research question is: What (Boin et al., 2020: 122) . stress that such crises may significantly undercut the legitimacy of public institutions mainly because there may be gaps between politicians, public officials and citizens in identifying the crisis and the ways to handle it. In democratic systems there is a constant search for a balance whereby citizens' evaluations serve as an input into government decisions (Cashore and Howlett, 2007) . A creeping crisis may disturb the possibility of achieving such a balance, thereby weakening the legitimacy of public institutions. Thus, citizens' evaluations of the effectiveness of the government's crisis management can indicate whether such a balance exists, and the extent to which the public regards the crisis management policies as legitimate. The more legitimacy they grant the government, the more willing they are to cooperate with it in handling the crisis. Therefore, explaining citizens' views regarding the public sector and their evaluation of the government's crisis management may help governments determine how to gain the public's cooperation.",

Usually, these measures are not specific to particular events and policies, but rather express the public's overall view about the public sector (Chanley et al., 2000; Keele, 2007; Khan, 2016) . Citizens primarily refer to their experience with the public sector and the information they receive about its operation in formulating their attitudes towards the public sector.

However, given the uncertainty, urgency and costliness of mistakes during a crisis, citizens probably have great difficulty assessing the impact of policies on their benefits and costs.

Numerous studies have found that citizens maintain that participation in decisionmaking and transparency are extremely important in their relations with public officials (Irvin and Stansbury, 2004; King et al., 1998; Vigoda-Gadot and Mizrahi, 2014; Wang and Wan Wart, 2007) . Such channels strengthen accountability and public responsibility, and hence, democratic legitimacy as well (Mizrahi and Minchuk, 2018; Rawls, 1971) . They are closely related to trust in government because the more citizens participate in decisions, the more they share responsibility with public officials and therefore may also trust them more. Hence, citizens who feel involved in the government's decision-making will most likely share responsibility for the choices made in crisis situations and therefore may have more positive views of the effectiveness of the government's crisis management.",

Studies indicate that these process variables may be related to outcomes variables such as satisfaction with and trust in the public sector (Vigoda-Gadot and Mizrahi, 2014) . The rationale implies that effective managerial standards and procedures most likely lead to good results (Schomaker and Bauer, 2020). Thus, we hypothesize that citizens' perceptions about public sector performance will be positively related to their perceptions about the effectiveness of the government's crisis management. Thus, we propose three additional hypotheses. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. To anchor our model more firmly in the crisis management literature we also incorporated some unique features of pandemics. In such situations, healthcare services and emergency organizations comprise a specific category of organizations that citizens evaluate. Therefore, we included several additional variables that we treated as control variables: 1) satisfaction with healthcare services, 2) trust in healthcare services and 3) trust in emergency organizations. We will test whether they have any independent influence on the relationships we suggested.",

These factors become even more critical in preparing for crisis situations. Studies in crisis management emphasize the centrality of planning ahead and detail how experience and learning can improve readiness (Boin and Bynander, 2014; Boin et al., 2018) . For example, prior experience with pandemics in East Asia undoubtedly prompted planning and readiness that eventually helped these countries deal with the pandemic more effectively (Boin, Lodge and Luesink, 2020) .",

Crises related to a global pandemic such as Covid-19 are fraught with confusion and uncertainty for most people. Hence, we argue that citizens' perceptions will guide their decisions about whether to take action, or avoid, adapt to, or even ignore risks. There are indications that people's assessments of their own preparedness for a crisis correlate with their perceptions about risks. Those who feel prepared will regard the risks as lower than those who believe they are not prepared (Donahue et al., 2014; Sattler et al., 2000) . Consequently, citizens who feel ready for a crisis are more likely to feel there is less risk than those who are unprepared and will therefore also be less critical of the government's crisis management. Thus, our last two hypotheses deal with the role of perceptions about readiness to meet a crisis. ",

In fact, the Israeli government declared an emergency situation during the establishment of the State in 1948 and this situation has been legally renewed ever since (Tzur, 1999) . Most of these situations have involved security threats. Consequently, Israeli citizens live in a constant high-risk situation, ever conscious that they or their family members could be involved in a terror attack. These feelings are part of the public and political discourse (Cohen and Eid, 2007) . The sense of emergency is thus deeply rooted in society but its appearance in daily life is relatively muted. Israeli society is also characterized by the strong inclination to avoid uncertainty (Hofstede, 2016), which is a main characteristic of the Covid-19 pandemic. Given this situation, we would expect to find strong feelings of personal threat and good personal and organizational readiness to deal with emergencies even in a healthcare crisis. However, at the same time, Israelis' trust in the public sector in general and their evaluation of its performance have always been relatively low (Vigoda-Gadot and Mizrahi, 2014) . The Israeli healthcare system, which handles many aspects of the Covid-19 crisis, has been relatively effective and highly rated among developed countries (OECD, 2015) . It includes elements that are mainly public. Israeli citizens pay a national healthcare tax to the government, which allocates a budget to four national health insurance companies that provide health services to all Israeli citizens.

However, this result is also consistent with the literature where the responsiveness and participatory culture of the public sector is considered a significant dimension of public sector performance (Vigoda-Gadot and Mizrahi, 2014) . Such mechanisms may provide practical methods to handle the pandemic; hence our focus on it.

At the same time, research emphasizes that the public sector and social players usually tend to be conservative and maintain the status quo (Jabotinsky and Cohen, 2020). An acute crisis may shake up these habits but the adaptation to new situations is usually slow and very gradual. Thus, in rapidly evolving crisis situations, traditional methods of operation persist, as do the relationships between the public sector and citizens (Boin et al., 2018) .

At the same time, trust is related to perceptions about the effectiveness of the crisis management only by mediation, which means that it has an impact on satisfaction. This insight differs from the common rationale suggested in the public management literature where satisfaction relates to trust rather than vice versa (Vigoda-Gadot and Mizrahi, 2014; Wang and Wan Wart, 2007) .

Citizens' attitudes towards the first variable are based on their ongoing experience with and information about the public sector that allows them to evaluate its responsiveness and transparency and their ability to participate in decisions about it. Our findings show that in evaluating the effectiveness of the government's crisis management citizens marginalize long-term performance indicators but expect the system to be responsive, transparent, and open to their participation.

Second, we incorporate three main insights regarding crises into a framework that delves into the core of such situations. These insights emphasize that crisis situations are primarily social phenomena, that the quality of the crisis management and leadership is critical for achieving good results and that in large-scale crises the coordination of efforts based on trust and transparency is the key to an effective response. Third, we demonstrate that in times of crisis citizens prioritize immediate, short-term results.

Segmentation according to individual characteristics showing that these factors distribute normally can solve most of the problems in such surveys (Gormley and Matsa, 2014). Indeed, in this research we guaranteed a normal distribution according to gender, age, education and income, which are the most relevant individual characteristics for the research setting. Second, the findings are limited to the Israeli population. However, we explained that in responding to the Covid-19 pandemic Israeli society and government faced similar challenges to those in other countries. Furthermore, our October 2020 survey reconfirmed our previous findings, indicating that they are consistent throughout the stages of the crisis and allowing possible generalization. Third, in such a deep crisis, social solidarity, interpersonal trust and social trust may affect the research variables. Thus, cooperation or conflicts at the societal level may influence the effectiveness of the government's crisis management. However, these aspects are beyond the scope of this research.",
