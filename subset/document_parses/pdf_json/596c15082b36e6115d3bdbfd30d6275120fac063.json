            "text": "Salmonella enterica subsp. serovar typhi (S. typhi) is a rod-shaped, Gram-negative, and motile bacterium. It is characterized as human-restricted monophyletic serovar that is found in humans only (Feasey et al. 2015; Thanh et al. 2016) . It is responsible for a large health burden globally i.e. typhoid fever, which is one of the life-threatening illness. Typhoid fever remains a significant illness that attributes to an estimate of 21.6-26.9 million cases and 216,000 deaths each year (Klemm et al. 2018) . It is the most common illness that occurs in Pakistan i.e. over 100,000 cases reported every year (Sah et al. 2020) . Alarmingly, in November 2016, Pakistan health authorities have reported an ongoing outbreak of newly emerged Extensively Drug Resistant (XDR) strain S. typhi, haplotype 58 (H58) that was spread in the Hyderabad district of Sindh province (Akram et al. 2020) . The Year of Life Lost's (YLLs) has estimated that 10.9 million cases of typhoid fever and 116.8 thousand deaths were caused by the newly emerged H58 XDR Salmonella typhi (Ali et al. 2016 ). Frighteningly, the increasing incidence of H58 and its dominance over other S. typhi strains have been reported worldwide in Australia, Canada, Denmark, Taiwan, Ireland, the United Kingdom and the United States (Akram et al. 2020) . Unfortunately, there is no official data on the prevalence of XDR S. typhi outside of Sindh province, though there are cases reported from all around the country. During the current SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, a substantial number of typhoid cases have emerged with clinical signs that are identical to . Furthermore, [ 20,000 typhoid cases were recorded in Pakistan only in June 2020 (Rasheed et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "The Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) has traditionally been used to track bacterial and viral disease distribution and also to investigate the evolution of antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Isolated cases of XDR S. typhi from Taiwan, Canada, and Denmark have shown a close connection (100 percent nucleotide match) to the closest sequenced XDR strain from Pakistan. This emphasizes the current outbreak's global impact. The fact that any SNPs discovered across S. typhi isolates during an outbreak suggest prolonged transmission (Rasheed et al. 2020) . Although whole-genome sequencing helped to understand the blueprint of the life and identification of numerous open reading frames with enough evidence for gene expression (Jamilah et al. 2020; Wadood et al. 2018) . However, it's still difficult to assign the function to all the genes due to the lack of of protein sequences with annotated biochemical function (Sivashankari and Shanmughavel 2006) . This process is itself time-consuming, costly and despite several efforts, only 50% of genes are annotated, leaving considerable amount of protein functionally unpredictable and are classified as conserved hypothetical proteins (homogeneous to unknown gene function) or hypothetical protein (no known homologous) (Sivashankari and Shanmughavel 2006) . Thus, the determination of protein function is still the challenge in post genomic era. This demands the bioinformatics methods to predict functions of un-annotated protein sequence by developing efficient tools (da Costa et al. 2018) . During genome analysis, these hypothetical proteins are predicted by various software as a large open reading frame without a characterized homologue in the protein database. It returns ''hypothetical protein'' as an annotation remark (da Costa et al. 2018; Pranavathiyani et al. 2020) . It is vital to understand the function of hypothetical proteins as many of them might be associated with the disease conditions. Upon investigation, it is predicted that these hypothetical proteins also tend to serve as drug targets because of their important role in the biochemical, physiological pathways and may act as biomarkers, pharmacological targets in proteomic and genomic research. Several methods are being used to identify and assign the function to hypothetical proteins such as the domain homology search, homology modeling and structure prediction with biochemical function assessment. Certainly, among these approaches ''Subtractive Genomics Approach'' is one of the most widely applied methodology to prioritize the drug targets. In silico strategies are cost effective and fast enough to annotate hypothetical proteins and explore their functions. The in silico approaches to the functional prediction of hypothetical proteins have been successfully used for several bacterial species such as vibrio cholera (Islam et al. 2015) , Neisseria gonorrhea (Bhairamadgi and Katti 2013) , Clostridium difficile (Dannheim et al. 2017) , Candida dubliniensis and Staphylococcus aureus (Varma et al. 2015) . Therefore, the purpose of this work is to assign the function to the hypothetical proteins present in the genome of the XDR strain of S. typhi (H58) with a comparative analysis to MDR (343077_213147 isolated from Bangladesh, and CT-18) and sensitive strains (Ty2 and STyphi_1553) specific to South Asia and globally Known. The main goal of this study was to better comprehend the hypothetical proteins S. typhi by assigning structural and biological functions to them. Comparative proteomic and genomic analysis, subtractive proteomic and genomic approach, functional annotations, and physico-chemical properties analysis was performed, and subcellular distribution, secondary structure, and active site were predicted. Furthermore, using structure based techniques, a reasonable quality model of the shortlisted protein was generated. The comparative analysis of these five strains led to novel proteins that contribute to the adaptation of bacterium to such harsh conditions. Several bioinformatics tools are used in this work for the functional annotation of such proteins, which might lead to the discovery of new therapeutic targets for screening, drug development, and design for the treatment against the Salmonella infection.",

Among the 351 hypothetical proteins, it predicted functions for ninety-eight hypothetical proteins and characterized as Endonuclease, Dehydrogenase, and structural proteins. The function of shortlisted hypothetical proteins was also identified by the ProtoNet tool to confirm the predicted function by other tools. It predicts the hypothetical protein function based on cluster network identification in terms of molecular function and by InterPro family.

About 351 proteins were shortlisted from these 535 hypothetical proteins as uniquely present in the XDR strain (i.e. comparison with MDR and NR strains of Salmonella typhi). Moreover, functional annotation of these 351 hypothetical proteins was performed through various computational tool i.e. Argot2, PFP, ProtoNet, and SMART. The functional prediction ability of these tools was further validated through ROC analysis with the submission of 100 known functional proteins from the XDR strain of Salmonella typhi. The overall accuracy of these tools was found to be 91% making five hypothetical proteins functional prediction more effectual. The physicochemical properties for these shortlisted proteins were estimated through ProtParam server that helped to understand the nature and type of proteins. Similar functional analysis was performed in Human Adenovirus by Naveed et al. (Naveed et al. 2017 ) and in Exiguobacterium antarcticum B7 by Klemm et al. (Klemm et al. 2018) . Consequently, the function to hypothetical proteins from H58 strain was assigned with a high confidence (Supplementary data S2) with specific characterization into cellular localization and physico-chemical properties. Furthermore, subtractive genomic analysis was performed to these 351 hypothetical proteins. Out of these, 350 hypothetical proteins were characterized as non-homolog proteins (in comparison to the human proteome). Consequently, five proteins were shortlisted as essential, drug target like, virulent non-homologous proteins and found only in the XDR strain of Salmonella typhi. Besides identification of function of hypothetical proteins, the main interest was to identify the potential drug targets in XDR H58 strains. From the above study, only one protein WP_000916613.1 was found to be fully characterized and was selected for further structure-based studies. Conclusively, secondary structure prediction and 3D modeling further provided insights into the spatial arrangement of the amino acids in the proteins to find out the most probable binding sites for the drugs. Certainly, the current study helped in the prediction of the function of hypothetical proteins that may be proposed as potential drug targets. The predicted results can be further validated through experimental studies. Therefore, it is hoped that the information of hypothetical proteins from S. typhi from the current study will be helpful for further in-vitro analysis of Salmonella typhi disease. ",

These hypothetical proteins may serve as potential therapeutic targets. While this contributes to the current understanding of the S. typhi XDR strain, still there is more to be explored in this field. More homologous proteins and structural information are needed in public repositories to fully evaluate some hypothetical proteins. For appropriate annotation and maintenance of entire genome, this process should repeat necessarily at regular intervals. The automation of this process would help ensure up-to-date databases.
