(10) Strenuous scientific efforts against the pandemic have led to the utilization of different modalities and novel techniques as vaccine platforms. COVID-19 vaccines are either mRNA (manufactured by Moderna and BioNTech/Pfizer), inactivated virus (Sinovac, Sinopharm), viral vector (Oxford/AstraZeneca, Gamaleya, Janssen/Johnson & Johnson, CanSino), or protein subunit (Novavax). The vaccine produced by BioNTech/Pfizer has been deployed to the public as the first-ever licensed COVID-19 vaccine. (11) More countries are entering the race of vaccine development such as Cuba, Brazil, and others. (12) People all over the globe have developed concerns regarding the COVID-19 authorized vaccines due to many reasons. (10) Some of these reasons include the quick development and release of the vaccines, the conspiracy theory including the origin of the vaccine, and possibly due to other factors to be explored. Vaccine Hesitancy (VH) existed before the COVID-19 emergence which augmented people's doubts and pushed people to become against vaccination. (13) One of the major obstacles against the success of the vaccination programs is VH, which can affect both the individual, by having a greater risk to get infected, and the community, by easily transmitting the pathogen. (14) As such, VH is among nine other health challenges considered as global health threats by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2019. (15) VH is defined as a behavior associated with delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccines despite available services. It is a complex and context-specific behavior that varies across time, place, and disease but is still influenced by factors such as complacency, convenience, and confidence. (16) 6",

(17) The 5C model identifies psychological antecedents for everyone that may indicate whether an individual will vaccinate or not. These five antecedents are confidence, complacency, constraints, calculation, and collective responsibility. The 5C scale is used to assess these 5 psychological antecedents of vaccination and to provide insights into how the individual may think, feel, and behave regarding vaccination. These antecedents impact the vaccination behavior to varying degrees and assess the mental portrayals, attitudinal and behavioral propensities that result from the environment and context the individual lives in. (17) (18) (19) These antecedents are used nowadays as a framework to assess VH in the high-income countries to find whether people will or will not take the COVID-19 vaccine. (20) The COVID-19 VH rate was reported to be significantly different by socio-demographic characteristics, seasonal flu vaccination status, COVID-19 risk perception, and perceived benefits and clinical barriers of the COVID-19 vaccine. (21) In Hong Kong, 63% of nursing staff were likely to take the COVID-19 vaccine when available. (22) In low-and middle-income countries, the vaccine acceptance rate ranged from 66.5% in Burkina Faso to 96.6% in Nepal with an overall acceptance rate of 80.3%. (23) At this stage of the pandemic, especially as vaccine compliance remains variable and inconsistent, public health officers and policymakers, especially in developing countries where healthcare resources are limited, need to understand the reasons and factors associated with VH. To investigate the associated physiological behaviors with this phenomenon, this study has been conceived, the present study aimed to investigate the psychological antecedents of the Arab population towards COVID-19 vaccination.",

(45) At the same time, a systematic review found variability of COVID-19 vaccination acceptance between countries with a large number having an acceptance rate of less than 60% which reflects the challenge in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. The lower rate was reported mainly from Middle East, Russia, and Eastern Europe, while higher rates were reported from East and Southeast Asia. It concluded that COVID-19 VH has a major role in controlling the pandemic which in turn needs a collaborative response from governments, policymakers, and media.

It reported two reasons determining vaccine acceptance which are case fatality and the number of COVID-19 cases, while the most powerful cause affecting intention to be vaccinated was the people's trust in the safety of vaccines provided by their countries.

(50) Many recent studies have investigated COVID-19 vaccines acceptance around the world. (13, 49, 50) In Kuwait, a large number of HCPs had a satisfied acceptance of the COVID-19 vaccine with VH concentrated more among female HCPs, nurses, and HCPs working in private facilities, (29) while in Egypt, the level of VH among medical students was reported at 46% with the main concerns were side effects and ineffectiveness of COVID-19 vaccine. (51) In Jordan, willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine (acceptance rates) with a significant portion of the population being indecisive. Participants were reported to be equally distributed between being willing, unwilling, and indecisive to take the COVID-19 vaccine. Participants reported more COVID-19 acceptance for the elderly than themselves. Vaccine development and availability are necessary but not sufficient to achieve immunity against a disease such as COVID-19. Reducing the incidence and prevalence of COVID-19, therefore, necessitates high acceptance and coverage rates to ensure high rates of the population will receive the vaccine.
