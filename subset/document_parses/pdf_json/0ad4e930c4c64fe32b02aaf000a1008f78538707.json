As usually occurs when an unexpected catastrophe happens, researchers are exploring the short-and long-term consequences on health and well-being, comparing with previous situations or another similar health-related crisis. In this sense, most studies have focused on the negative aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, Nicola Magnavita and colleagues conceptualize the COVID-19 pandemic crisis as a macro stressor that is negatively affecting the mental health of workers, particularly those in the healthcare sector [2] . Similarly, Martin Sanchez-Gomez and colleagues considered that the COVID-19 pandemic is a traumatic event that is associated with feelings of fear and impaired mental health [3] . Drawing on the Cognitive Activation Theory of Stress [4] , they conducted two studies comprising more than 1100 participants in total. Their data supported the idea that the COVID-19 pandemic is associated with intrusive thoughts that keep people in a hyperactivated state (i.e., hyperarousal) which, in turn, diminishes mental health and increases negative emotions such as fear of social activities and being infected. On the other hand, taking a more positive approach, Georgia Libera Finstad and colleagues [5] reviewed previous studies that have explored resilience and growth at work after being exposed to a traumatic event such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Their findings identified the interplay between both environmental and contextual factors in predicting adjustment to remote work.

Indeed, people with cardiovascular disease have a higher risk of experiencing fatigue at work and, therefore, normative data in this population are needed. Regarding methodological issues, the study conducted by Aristides I. Ferreira and colleagues [9] addresses one important issue in advancing the field of OHP: combining self-report measures with physiological measures. As one of the typical limitations that studies include is the lack of physiological measures compared to self-reported measures, they discuss studies integrating physiological and self-reported measures and offer interesting further research avenues. Particularly, they reviewed the role of biomarkers and hormones in the relationship between presenteeism (another emerging topic in OHP) and performance.",

            "text": "Furthermore, from a methodological point of view, OHP should incorporate more complex designs beyond cross-sectional survey studies to capture dynamic processes in a changing environment. For example, Ieva Urbanaviciute et al. [10] conducted a study with two measurement points in a sample of 959 employees working in Switzerland. They used a latent transition approach to explore dynamics between psychosocial work environment and employee well-being. Additionally, Oliver Weigelt et al. [11] reported the results of a weekly diary study that explores how positive and negative events affect engagement over time. According to theoretical frameworks that advocate for analyzing how certain events can produce behavioral change in organizational contexts [12, 13] , they focus on the effects that exposure to discrete events at work have on workers' engagement through the emotions associated with such events. Their results revealed \"that positive events accumulate to feed continuously high levels of work engagement over periods of several months\" (p. 23). Finally, following a qualitative approach, Isabell Koinig and Sandra Diehl [14] report the key role of healthy leadership and the adoption of workplace health promotion practices, as part of the organizational culture, to develop healthy organizations.",

These studies use strong and innovative theoretical approaches to provide evidence regarding the importance of working characteristics and resources to promote healthier and more sustainable environments in which employees can be happy and productive. Moreover, their findings offer several clues for implementing measures and developing healthier organizations in an uncertain and changing environment, particularly in the post-pandemic era. We hope the readers can benefit from the insights of these papers and that their findings can attract the attention of the scientific community in order to pursue further investigation into emerging issues in OHP.
