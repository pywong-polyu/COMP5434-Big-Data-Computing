            "text": "Purpose Window of opportunity trials (WOT) are increasingly common in oncology research. In WOT participants receive a drug between diagnosis and anti-cancer treatment, usually for the purpose of investigating that drugs effect on cancer biology. This qualitative study aimed to understand patient perspectives on WOT. Methods We recruited adults diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer awaiting definitive therapy at a single-academic medical center to participate in semi-structured interviews. Thematic and content analyses were performed to identify attitudes and factors that would influence decisions about WOT participation. Results We interviewed 25 women diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer. The most common positive attitudes toward trial participation were a desire to contribute to research and a hope for personal benefit, while the most common concerns were the potential for side effects and how they might impact fitness for planned treatment. Participants indicated family would be an important normative factor in decision-making and, during the COVID-19 pandemic, deemed the absence of family members during clinic visits a barrier to enrollment. Factors that could hinder participation included delay in standard treatment and the requirement for additional visits or procedures. Ultimately, most interviewees stated they would participate in a WOT if offered (N = 17/25). Conclusion In this qualitative study, interviewees weighed altruism and hypothetical personal benefit against the possibility of side effect from a WOT. In-person family presence during trial discussion, challenging during COVID-19, was important for many. Our results may inform trial design and communication approaches in future window of opportunity efforts.",

The research team then inspected excerpts across all major codes to identify emergent patterns, repetitions, and opportunities for comparison.

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. Firstly, the interviewed patients may represent a group of individuals especially altruistic or interested in research, given the high rate of agreement to participate in the interview study. Thus while the majority of these patients stated they would be willing to participate in a WOT, this may be an overestimation from the real world. Also, the population of women interviewed came from a single institution and does not reflect the diversity of women in the USA; additional studies would be useful to understand how the themes identified here apply and vary across different geographies, ages, races/ethnicities, and other socioeconomic factors. This study highlights several factors that may influence participation in WOT, but given the small sample size does not characterize which factors matter most. Further assessments of patients with breast cancer are needed to inform WOT development.",
