Study participants 32 underwent a cognitive and physical stress task with easy and hard conditions with sweat being 33 collected after each task. Resulting analysis found a signal for 22 steroid biomarkers and we 34 report detailed information on selected biomarkers, given their applicability to timely real-world 35 exemplars, including cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone, allopregnanolone, estrone, aldosterone, 36 and 20a/b-dihydrocortisone. Sweat is a biofluid rich in biomarkers that can provide information about human cognitive 50 performance, health, disease state(s), nutrition and environmental impacts. Steroids and other 51 immune biomarkers have been detected in eccrine sweat (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) . Non-invasive measurement tools 52 of biomarkers are needed and have become especially salient given recent viral outbreaks like 53 SARS-CoV-2, where in-person blood collection is not feasible or unadvisable. The monitoring of 54 some biomarkers may help to monitor human performance in industrial and occupational 55 settings, may help to predict and track acquired disease processes like obesity, and may help to 56 determine how psychiatric sequalae are experienced and expressed. 57 58 Steroids of interest for the monitoring and enhancement of human performance and health are 59 many and include cortisol, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), allopregnanolone, estrone and 60 aldosterone. Cortisol is secreted in response to stress, suppressing the hypothalamic-pituitary-61 adrenocortical (HPA) axis and negatively effecting health and cognition (13). DHEA is 62 implicated in many physiological processes with impacts on disease resistance and immune 63 function (14) . DHEA and cortisol are the most common products of the stress response from the 64 endocrine system, mediating short and long-term stress responses via the HPA-axis; DHEA can 65 be converted into dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S) and has been shown to antagonize 66 the effects of cortisol (15). In humans, basal DHEA levels can be altered by exposure to 67 traumatic events like military combat and lower cortisol/DHEA ratios have been found in 68 patients with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (16). Positive correlations have also been 69 found between current PTSD symptoms and the ratio of DHEA to allopregnanolone (17). 70",

Participants had these glass beads poured 135 from the tubes into their hands and then instructed to roll them between the palms of their hands 136 for 60 seconds. After collection of these samples, the beads were returned to the containers, and 137 then were stored at 4 \u00baC until biomarker analysis.

Liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry 83 (LCMS) has been used to investigate the production and clearance of free cortisol (via 84 downstream inactive metabolites) in human eccrine sweat during heat and/or exercise induced 85 stress with sweat cortisol concentrations being similar to those measured in saliva (4,12).86 87 Analysis of target biomarkers in sweat has typically required a defined volume of sweat 88 necessary to apply benchtop assays for measurement or have utilized wearable devices for 89 collection via exercise stress (5,12,25). Using pouches, wrist worn tubes (e.g. Macroduct), skin 90 surface scraping, vacuuming of sweat droplets, skin swabbing with absorbent materials, glass 91 rollers and collecting sweat from a whole body rinse have all been previously employed to 92 collect volumes of human eccrine sweat needed for analysis (26,27). 2-D molecular mapping of 93 latent finger prints using LCMS with electrospray ionization (LCMS-ESI) has been successful in 94 identifying gender, age, ethnicity and disease markers of human subjects with over 80% 95 accuracy showing that monitoring of biomarkers in very low volumes of secretions current study, we explore the possibility of utilizing glass beads to collect very small 99 volumes of eccrine sweat via surface capture from the palms of the hands for targeted steroid 100 biomarker analysis in response to stress. Furthermore, we utilize a novel washing method to 101 extract the target biomarkers from the glass beads which simplifies sample preparation and clean 102 up in comparison to standard approaches such as solid phase extraction that is often used for 103 plasma and urine biofluid samples. Finally, the developed approach inclusive of sample 104 collection, sample preparation and LCMS methodology allows for robust analysis of non-105 derivatized steroids thereby simplifying the analysis. Our discussion of results focuses 106 predominately on cortisol, DHEA, allopregnanolone, aldosterone and estrone given interest in 107 enhancement of human performance as mentioned earlier. We hypothesized that collection of 108 palmar sweat via surface capture would be a non-invasive, rapid, easily scalable method which 109 would yield sweat samples rich in molecular information correlating with physiological systems, 110 and provide a sensitive method for measuring biomarker changes on a time scale of minutes gave informed consent before taking part in the experiment.

Of note, this current manuscript focuses on the collection and characterization 123 of biomarkers collected from palmar sweat rather than thermographic imaging.

The data presented supports this 204 hypothesis and shows that the steroid response is both individualistic and dynamic in real time. 205 The change of measured biomarkers in response to short cognitive or physical challenges is 206 significant and occurs within the time frame of minutes which agrees with the known time frame 207 response of salivary and sweat cortisol (12). The presentation of the data in Figures 2 & 3 as a 208 percent change in biomarker levels allows for comparison between individuals despite the strong 209 individual variability of raw data observed between study participants. 210 211 Given multiple factors that may influence sweat production, contents, volume, and activation of 212 individual pores (i.e., hydration, health status, medications, diet, gender, topical treatments, etc.orders of magnitude. For example, the LCMS-ESI-SIM response for DHEA 215 spanned from 10 5 to 10 7 counts for the participants. The general observed trend in the data was 216 an increase in biomarker concentrations after completion of the physical task, with the exception 217 of a single participant (Participant C) as seen in Figure 3. By comparison, the general trend 218 observed was a decrease in biomarker concentration after completion of the cognitive task as 219 shown in Figure 2. Hyde and colleagues (29) (data not shown) also demonstrated a 4-fold 220 increase in the number of sweat pores activated after completion of the finger tapping physical 221 challenge compared with the N-back cognitive task using thermographic imaging, suggesting 222 that an increase in sweat pore activation contributes in part to the increased biomarker signal 223 measured by LCMS-ESI-SIM. Further studies are needed to deconvolute the individual 224 contributions of increased sweat volume and increased biomarker concentration to the invasive methods for detecting biomarkers are needed in order to enhance the ability to 229 monitor and track human performance, health, and disease process. The selected biomarkers 230 presented are of particular interest for tracking stress responsiveness and changes in aging 231 populations. U.S. military veterans from Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF), Operation Enduring 232 Freedom (OEF) and Operation New Dawn (OND) are a timely example of a population with 233 multiple acquired physical and psychiatric conditions where biomarker tracking may be 234 beneficial.
