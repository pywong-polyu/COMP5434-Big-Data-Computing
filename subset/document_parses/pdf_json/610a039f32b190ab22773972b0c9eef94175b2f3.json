Although this global confinement has had potentially huge unintended consequences on the environment and on its associated wildlife, this study shows that it has also impacted the human experience of nature. Based on an online questionnaire, this study aims to assess how the significant changes in people's everyday lives induced by the French lockdown impacted their relationship with other species. Participants did not only observe and interact more with non human species, but also discovered new traits characterizing them, and felt less lonely thanks to them. The impact of the lockdown was stronger on people's relationship with their pets, farm animals, home plants and with birds than with other plants and animals. This study further demonstrates that participants with different profiles have been affected differently. In particular, women and people with better access to nature were clearly more sensitive to changes and have been more positively impacted in their relationships with other species. Acting as a real world experiment, the lockdown reveals to which extent our experience of nature is embedded in social, cultural and political contexts.",

In order to face the Covid-19 outbreak, governments around the world imposed strong restrictions to their populations such as keeping physical distance, stopping nonessential activities and limiting the movements of people. This global \"lockdown\" resulted in almost two thirds of the world population being asked to stay at home and placed under a confinement by April 2020. Since then, in many parts of the world, such drastic measures have also been reactivated to face the second and third waves of the pandemic.",

They also assessed how the Covid-19 crisis impacted biodiversity. In this perspective, their main interest was in understanding of how non human species can adapt to rapid transformations of their environment and whether or not nature has recovered from this unprecedented reduction of human activities. As for examples, Derryberry et al. (2020) showed that the reduction in traffic noise led to a shift in song frequencies in a bird species. Gordo et al. (2020) revealed that although birds detectability increased in Spanish urban areas, the probability of their occurrence remained stable.",

Whereas several studies have shown how biodiversity clawed back spaces in humandominated landscape (e.g. Pearson et al., 2020; Gordo et al., 2020; Silva-Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2020) , my work rather shows how the lockdown modified people attention toward other beings. Non-humans species did not only recover spatially but as well in the everyday life of humans and this can also lead to a positive impact on biodiversity. Indeed, it is recognized that an increased experience of nature is likely to improve people commitment to protect wildlife (Chan et al., 2016; Pr\u00e9vot et al., 2018; Cazalis and Pr\u00e9vot, 2019) .",

Although living in a city versus living in the countryside does not seem to affect that much the respondents' sensitivity, people having a garden, access to a park or living close to natural environments were more likely to change their relationship with other species during the lockdown. Other characteristics of the participants had an impact on their answers. For instance, older people were overall less affected than others. Educated people seemed to be more sensitive in their observation/interaction with plants and birds but less than others regarding how animals helped them to feel less lonely. Participants being already familiar with biodiversity are more likely to be impacted and have stronger sensitivity to birds. People living alone have been more affected regarding how their plants and animals helped them fight against loneliness, but have been less sensitive in terms of observation, interaction and learning from other species. People being confined for longer periods of time seem to have developed a higher sensitivity to a priori less accessible species namely the plants. Such observations generate a number of hypotheses and further studies would be valuable to fully address the involved mechanisms. For instance, it would be interesting to understand whether educated people are more rational toward nature whereas less educated people would be more emotional and how being in a group and living collectively could facilitate the observation, interaction and learning from wild species.",

But, while some authors claimed that the \"concerted and urgent global response to Covid-19 should pave the way for similar responses to global ecological crises (Bang and Khadakkar, 2020 )\", the main interest of my study is to demonstrate how such responses can also transform people experience of nature. Acting as a real world experiment, the lockdown does not only reveal how a major change in society can trigger this experience but also who may be more impacted. Experiences of nature are complex and diverse and are embedded in social, cultural and political contexts (Clayton et al., 2017) . One of the main conclusions of this study is that people are not equal regarding changes such as the ones induced by the lockdown. Although it is globally accepted that mankind needs to reconnect with nature and to develop a new sensitivity toward other beings, this study contributes to demonstrate the importance of considering such issues in light of the social and political organizations of human societies. In that respect, I identified key profiles that should be considered when facing deep and global societal changes.",
