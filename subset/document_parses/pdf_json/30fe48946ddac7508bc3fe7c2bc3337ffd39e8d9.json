Our nation is at a critical time in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic with important decisions ahead of us, especially concerning the efficacy and safety of vaccines. Policymaking must be informed by the best available evidence without it being distorted, concealed, or otherwise deliberately miscommunicated. We find ongoing reports and incidents of the politicization of science, particularly the overriding of evidence and advice from public health officials and derision of government scientists, to be alarming. It undermines the credibility of public health agencies and the public's confidence in them when we need it most. Ending the pandemic will require decision-making that is not only based on science but also sufficiently transparent to ensure public trust in, and adherence to, sound public-health instructions. Any efforts to discredit the best science and scientists threaten the health and welfare of us all.",

The nursing profession brings vital intelligence, science, and education to the public. At the core of nursing care is health promotion. Nurses have a professional and ethical duty to provide evidence-based information to the public regarding the importance and safety of immunizations. We partner with patients, families, communities, and stakeholders to help individuals and the public make informed health care decisions. The Academy advocates for respectful dialogue with patients and their families who have questions about immunizations (American Academy of Nursing, 2020a).",

In our statement, we also urge the plan to not lose sight of the critical public health measures necessary while the distribution occurs (such as contact tracing, access to rapid testing, continuing to maintain social distance, and access to a vital supply of personal protective equipment). Further, concerning the need to advance health equity, the Academy recommended culturally and linguistically appropriate services (CLAS) standards, as developed by the Department of Health and Human Services, to mitigate vaccine hesitancy. CLAS standards information distributed with multiple modalities could help to inform, educate, and support the vulnerable communities that need the vaccine.",

We spoke out against the impacts of systemic racism on health, and hosted an Institute for Nursing Leadership Critical Conversation on Health Equity and Racism in partnership with the Academy's Diversity and Inclusivity Committee and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. We inducted 230 distinguished nurse leaders to join the Fellowship of the American Academy of Nursing through our first virtual induction ceremony and their reflections captured on video were nothing short of moving. We celebrated the life's work of five remarkable Living Legends: were not able to share a glance to show our pride, give a hug, or offer a kind word in person, I could feel the energy of the Academy Fellowship all around me during the virtual policy conference.",
