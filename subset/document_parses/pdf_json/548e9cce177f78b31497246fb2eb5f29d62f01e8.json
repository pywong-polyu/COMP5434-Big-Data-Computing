For this reason, WHO recommends children to be moderate to vigorous physical active for at least 60 min per day, including musclestrengthening and bone-strengthening activities at least 3 days per week. 6 Although there are no specific evidence-based PA guidelines for children with CP, it is clear that they have lower levels of PA and higher levels of time spent sedentary than their peers 7 ",

These problems can, in turn, result in poorer overall health, reduced life expectancy and a greater burden of disease in years of life lost to disability. 9 10 Furthermore, evidence suggests that more than 25% of adults with CP experience mobility decline, for some resulting in persistent loss of independent gait function, thus, emphasising the importance of maintaining a physical active lifestyle throughout childhood and adolescence. 11 Ideally, childhood should be marked by high levels of intense play and habitual PA, which, in addition to providing protective physical benefits, also appears to improve mental health. 12 13 Predictors of PA In Scandinavia, healthcare professionals offer standardised clinical examinations throughout childhood using the Cerebral Palsy Follow-Up Programme (CPUP), which was developed in Sweden more than 20 years ago 14 and was adopted in Denmark as a National Clinical Quality Database by the Danish Clinical Registries in 2015. CPUP is designed to support early detection of complications, such as hip dislocation, scoliosis and muscle contracture, as well as to improve the quality of healthcare. 14 15 Danish clinical guidelines for physiotherapy and occupational therapy for children with CP emphasise that future research should focus on the short-term and longterm effects of the interventions applied to improve the children's activities of daily living. 16 Despite this recommendation, it has not been investigated whether the standardised examinations and accompanying variables of CPUP are associated with habitual PA. Thus, potential objective predictors of PA can be identified through this national clinical quality database, allowing early detection and potentially improved interventions.",

Nevertheless, bootstrap validation will be performed to increase internal validation. 38 Using registry data supports clinically relevant data on all persons in the target group; however, it also poses a risk of having data that is missing for unidentifiable reasons, which complicates the handling of missing data.
