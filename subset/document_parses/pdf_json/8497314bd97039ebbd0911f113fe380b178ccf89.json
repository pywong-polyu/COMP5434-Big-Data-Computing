The aim of this study was to assess the association between adherence to a Mediterranean diet (MD) and the excretion of sodium and potassium as surrogate measures of intake. This is a cross-sectional analysis as part of a larger study (the iMC SALT randomized controlled trial) among workers of a public university. A food frequency questionnaire was used to assess the adherence to MD, using the alternative Mediterranean diet (aMED) score; sodium and potassium excretions were estimated by 24-h urine collections. Sociodemographic and other lifestyle characteristics were also obtained. The associations between the adherence to MD and Na and K excretion were calculated by logistic regression, adjusting for confounding variables. From the 109 selected participants, seven were excluded considering urine screening and completeness criteria, leaving a final sample of 102 subjects (48% male, average age 47 years). Mean sodium and potassium excretion were 3216 mg/day and 2646 mg/day, respectively. Sodium and potassium excretion were significantly higher in men, but no differences were found according to different levels of MD adherence. In logistic regression analysis, sodium, potassium, and sodium-to-potassium ratio urinary excretion tertiles were not associated with MD adherence (low/moderate versus high), even after adjustment for confounding variables. A high adherence to MD was thus not associated with a different level of sodium and potassium intake.",

In particular excessive dietary intake of sodium [5, 6] is a leading determinant of high blood pressure and cardiovascular risk [7] [8] [9] . Several behavioural interventions have been prooosed to reduce sodium intake [10] , but nevertheless most adult populations have an estimated mean sodium intake which exceeds 2.30 g/day (100 mmoL/day) [11] , above the WHO recommendation <2 g/day (or <85 mmoL/day) [12] . In contrast, increased potassium intake has been shown to reduce systolic blood pressure and stroke events [13] [14] [15] and the WHO recommends a potassium intake of at least 3.51 g/day (90 mmoL/day) for adults [16] . The sodium-to-potassium (Na/K) ratio has also been considered a good predictor of hypertension and cardiovascular disease [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] .",

A detailed description of the project has been reported elsewhere [34] . In brief, participants from the University of Porto were recruited by a physician during routine health appointments and, if eligible, signed the informed consent form and were randomly assigned to the intervention group (IG) or to the control group (CG). The intervention lasted 8 weeks, during which the participants use the Salt Control H equipment to dose salt when preparing and cooking food at home. During this study, a total of four visits, excluded the screening visit (visit 0), were conducted to monitor different outcomes. The primary outcome was the 24-h urinary sodium excretion, which has been measured during the four visits. Blood pressure and anthropometric data were also collected. Ethical approval was provided by the Ethics Committee of the Centro Hospitalar Universit\u00e1rio S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o and good clinical practices regarding clinical trials with intervention were followed [35, 36] .",

To convert food intakes in grams we used the software Food Processor Plus (ESHA Research, Inc., Salem, OR, USA) adapted to the Portuguese population by using the values from Portuguese Tables of Food Composition for typical Portuguese foods [42] . The nutritional content of local food was taken from standard nutrient tables, whereas the content of commercial food (e.g., pizza and ready-to-eat-food) was derived from labelled ingredients and nutrients. For soup, 26% of this food has been considered for the calculation of the vegetable score considering that the recipe for 350 g of \"Juliana soup\" requires 90 g of vegetables (excluding potatoes).",

The items included in this score were nine: vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts, whole grains, fish, red meat and processed meat, ethanol and the ratio of monounsaturated fatty acids to saturated fatty acids (MUFA/SFA). For vegetables, legumes, fruits, nuts, whole grains, and fish, consider as beneficial components, were assigned a value of 1 when consumption of subjects was above the sex-specific median, while when consumption was below the median were assigned a value of 0. For red meat and processed meats, consider as detrimental components, was assigned a value of 1 when the consumption of subjects was below the sex-specific median or above the median were assigned a value of 0. Alcohol was the only component in which score has been assigned according to cut off, a value of 1 was assigned to men whose consumption was 5-25 g/day and women who consumed 5-15 g/day. Finally, MUFA/SFA was used to assess the quality of fat intake, giving a value of 0 to participants whose MUFA:SFA ratio was below the sex-specific median and a value of 1 to participants whose ratio was at or above the median. So, total score of a participant ranged from 0 (minimal adherence to the traditional Mediterranean diet) to 9 (maximum adherence). A low adherence to Mediterranean diet has been considered when the score was between 0-3, moderate 4-5, or high 6-9.",

Although we could expect that the contribution of potassium could be higher in a pattern of greater adherence to the Mediterranean diet, considering its plant-based component, no significant differences were found, which could be possibly due to a different contribution of some foods rich in potassium intake that were not captured in the scores. However, in another study [30] conducted in Japan, an association of a higher intake of favourable nutrients with the adherence to MD adapted for the Japanese population, occurred, with the exception of sodium intake. The estimation of dietary intake has been made with FFQ and this method could also have underestimated the amount of sodium ingested due to the inaccuracy and bias assessing salt added at the table and during cooking. Fujiwara [47] found in a Japanese population that the dietary pattern of \"fish and vegetables\" was correlated with healthy outcomes and, at the same time, to the amount of sodium ingested. The author suggested that the mains sources of sodium in this healthy dietary pattern were salted fish and sea products, pickled vegetables, miso soup and salt-containing seasonings. La Verde [31] found that the inverse relationship between adherence to MD and hypertension was no more significant after the adjustment for sodium intake. Instead, Mirmiran [32] found that Mediterranean score was inversely associated with urinary sodium-to-potassium ratio.",

However, in the logistic regression model after adjusting for energy intake, the relationship between the urinary excretion of sodium, potassium and their ratio was not significantly associated with the adherence to MD, even after adjustment for BMI. This analysis was also important considering the significantly higher urinary excretion of sodium, potassium, and their ratio in male than female, which persisted after adjusting for energy intake and BMI (data not shown).

In addition, the amount of salt added at the table and during the preparation of the meal is not considered either. Both factors have an influence on sodium intake and could bring the level of salt intake above the recommended level, and similarly across different levels of adherence to MD, including for those subjects with a high score in MD adhesion. In this study 100% of the males and 58% of the females with a high adherence to MD were above the WHO recommendation for sodium; while male and female participants whose intake of potassium was above 3510 mg/day were respectively 41% and 70%. The mean sodium-to-potassium ratio was above the recommendation of 1 (mmol/mmol) for both sexes at every level of adherence of MD. Around the world salt intake came from different sources, depending on the geographical area. In the Western countries the main sources are processed foods, while in Asia is discretionary salt [11, 50] . In the Portuguese population the main source of sodium is the salt added at the table (29.2%), followed by bread and toasts (18.0%), soup (8.2%) and salami and processed meat (7.0%) [48] .

The 24-h urine collection is the only method that can measure without reported bias the amounts of salt and potassium ingested and is considered the gold standard method by several authors to estimate sodium intake [52, 53] . Nevertheless, although the standard method for assessing sodium and potassium intake is 24-h urine collection, which is based on the recognition that 24-h urinary sodium and potassium excretion may reflect at least 90% of sodium [54] and 70% of the ingested potassium [54] , this approach also presents the limitation of the 24-h urinary excretion, which can differ significantly from the 24-h measured intake [55] and may present inaccuracies and collection errors [56] .",
