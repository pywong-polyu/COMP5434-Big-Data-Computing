Design Prospective cohort study (PAN.DEM) nested within the halted parent trial (LIVE@Home.Path). Setting Households in Norway immediate before and 6-9 weeks into the COVID-19 restrictions. Participants 104 dyads (persons with mild to moderate dementia aged \u226565 and their informal carers) completed both prepandemic and pandemic assessments, among 237 in the parent trial. Mini-Mental Status Examination score 15-26 or Functional Assessment Staging score 3-7 covered dementia severity. Main outcome measures Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-12) total (range 0-144), psychosis (range 0-24), hyperactive behaviour (range 0-60) and mood subsyndrome (range 0-48) scores; Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) total score (range 0-38). Results We found an overall increase in BPSD by NPI-12 total score comparing prepandemic to pandemic levels (median 16 IQR (4.5-29) to 20 (7-32.5), p=0.03) over a mean of 86 days (SD 19). NPI-12 total score worsened in 57 (55%) of people with dementia and was associated with postponed or averted contacts with healthcare professionals (logistic regression, OR 3.96, 95% CI 1.05 to 14.95). Psychosis subsyndrome levels increased (0 (0-3) to 0.5 (0-6), p=0.01) in 37 (36%) persons; this worsening was associated with partial insight (9.57, 1.14 to 80.71) and reduced informal carer contact (4.45, 1.01 to 19.71). Moreover, depressive symptoms increased as assessed by CSDD total score (5 (3-9) to 7 (4-12), p=0.01) and worsened for 56 (54%), which was inversely associated with psychotropic drugs on-demand (0.16, 0.03 to 0.75). Conclusions BPSD worsened during the first months of the COVID-19 restrictions, most pronounced for psychosis and depression. These BPSD exacerbations have implications for pandemic policies, emphasising that restrictions must balance COVID-19 morbidity and mortality against dementia deterioration.

As a result, people with dementia living in the community are not only at risk from COVID-19 morbidity and mortality; they are also threatened from unforeseen effects of the restrictions. 4 5 Behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) cover a wide range of",

Longitudinally, persistent BPSD may be found in up to 80% of people with dementia. 6 BPSD are best managed with structured, non-pharmacological interventions, placing psychotropic drugs as secondary treatment options. 7 Preliminary evidence indicates that BPSD may be exacerbated under the COVID-19 restrictions. Eight weeks into the Argentinian quarantine, informal carers reported worsening of anxiety, insomnia and depression among persons at different stages of Alzheimer's and related dementias living at home (N=119). 8 In another study, family carers stated worsening BPSD in 60% of Italian outpatients with various stages and aetiologies of dementia 1 month into the pandemic (N=4913). 9 This study also found that 28% required changes in psychotropic medication to address irritability, apathy, agitation and depression. Further, nursing home patients separated from the outside world in France with mild Alzheimer's disease reported increased anxiety and depression when asked to evaluate their own experience of the pandemic retrospectively (N=58). 10 However, all these studies are cross-sectional and thus far, there is a dearth of longitudinal data tracking changes in BPSD during COVID-19 by comparing prepandemic to pandemic rates. 11 In this study, we aim to address this significant gap in the literature using data from the prospective PAN.DEM study. 12 This study is nested within the ongoing LIVE@Home.Path trial 13 and was launched by our team to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions (implemented in Norway on 12 March 2020) on home-dwelling people with dementia. Here, we present comparisons of prepandemic and pandemic BPSD, and explore factors associated with worsening BPSD.",

Trained data collectors blindly assessed all dyads in direct conversation every 6 months for 2 years (2019-2021). The prepandemic 6-month assessment was close to complete when the COVID-19 restrictions replaced trial protocol (figure 1A). Physical distancing (ie, restrictions on gatherings, public transport closure, stay at homeregulations and limitations on movement) formed the basis for the restrictions, 3 which implied that healthcare was limited to those most in need. 12 In response, we developed the semistructured PANdemic in DEMentia (PAN. DEM) telephone interview for informal carers to capture if, and how, dyads were affected by the outbreak (online supplemental file). This assessment included selected instruments from the parent trial in addition to questions regarding the pandemic. We consecutively invited as many dyads as possible from the parent trial to complete the PAN.DEM assessment from week 6 of restrictions until eased the 9th week (20 April 2020 to 15 May 2020).

We administered two informal carer-rated scales at both time points: (1) The Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-12) assesses frequency and severity of delusions, hallucinations, agitation, depression, anxiety, euphoria, apathy, disinhibitions, irritability, aberrant motorial behaviour, sleep disturbances and appetite changes over the four preceding weeks. 16 Each of these 12 domains is scored from 0 (no symptoms) to 12 (very severe symptoms), a score \u22654 is regarded a BPSD with symptom load of clinical relevance. 6 These domains are further aggregated to generate subsyndrome scores for psychosis comprised of delusions and hallucinations (0-24), hyperactive behaviour comprised agitation, euphoria, irritation, disinhibition, aberrant motor behaviour (0-60), mood comprised depression, apathy, sleep disturbances and appetite changes (0-48), and finally, a total NPI-12 score (0-144); 17 (2) The Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD) assesses nineteen items of depressive symptoms during the prior week, each rated from 'absent' to 'severe' (0-2) or 'symptoms not possible to evaluate' (missing). 18 Adding item scores generate the CSDD total score (0-38). 18 A CSDD total score \u22658 indicates depression of clinical relevance. 19 The Norwegian versions of NPI-12 and CSDD have robust psychometric properties. 16 18-20 In addition to BPSD, we collected the following data at the prepandemic assessment: the persons with dementia's level of functioning in activities of daily living by Physical Self-Maintenance Scale (PSMS) 21 and Instrumental Activities of Daily Living Scale (IADL), 22 health by the General Medical Health Rating Scale (GMHR), 23 possible dementia aetiology following the International Classification of Diseases-10th version, 24 and use of Open access healthcare services and medications as specified by the dyads. Drugs catalogued in the Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Index (ATC) administered in a set schedule were regarded 'regular', whereas all others were documented as 'on demand'. 25 Psychotropic drugs included antipsychotic (N05A), anxiolytic (N05B), hypnotic and sedative (N05C), antidepressant (N06A) and antiementia drugs (N06D) by ATC. Demographical data (age, gender, residency, kinship) were self-reported. We evaluated dementia severity in terms of cognition with MMSE and level of functioning with FAST at inclusion. 14 15 At the pandemic assessment, the informal carers were also asked to estimate the degree of insight presented by the person with dementia into the COVID-19 situation and change in (1) contact with the informal carer, (2) volunteering services and (3) municipal healthcare services (home nursing services, home help, day-care, and in-home and out-of-home respite care) due to the COVID-19 restrictions. 12 Finally, informal carers stated if contacts with healthcare professionals were postponed or averted.",

Next, we dichotomised those NPI-12 and CSDD sum scores that changed into worsening/not worsening and used multiple logistic regression analysis to explore factors associated. We included the following covariates for persons with dementia: age, gender, residency, dementia aetiology, MMSE, FAST, IADL, PSMS, GMHR, number of psychotropic drugs prescribed regularly and on-demand, and the COVID-19 specific outcomes. We also included age and gender of the informal carers. Covariates were selected based on our expertise in research and clinical dementia care. The Akaike information criterion guided model selection. Selected models were then checked for multicollinearity, robustness and goodness-of-fit by Pearson and Hosmer-Lemeshow test. FAST, IADL and PSMS showed moderate to strong positive correlation, but including all three covariates substantially improved the models.

Despite efforts, we were not able to invite all potential respondents through consecutive sampling before the restrictions were eased for the first time, explaining the limited sample size. CSDD is not validated for telephone interviews 18 yet our findings using CSDD were consistent with the depression domain of NPI-12, which can be used as a telephone interview instrument. 16 Previous work has shown that carer psychosocial factors such as sense of competence, guilt and relationship quality account for up to 56% of the variance in BPSD-related distress. 26 In the case of the pandemic, stress-related symptoms were experienced by two-thirds of family carers soon after the outbreak hit Italy (N=4913) and were associated with incident or worsening BPSD. 9 The authors conclude that they could not determine whether increased BPSD were the cause or consequence of carer distress, as both counterparts were exposed to similar conditions during quarantine. Even though we did not assess such domains, these considerations apply to our study. Another point is that 28% of the informal carers reported reduced contact with the person with dementia, leaving them with less clinical observation. As 44% of the dyads were not living together, we suggest that some violated the restrictions to visit their loved ones and keep their obligations as careers, possibly mitigating the impact on BPSD. These weaknesses should be considered when interpreting the results, along with the wide CIs of the covariates associated with worsening BPSD. Notably, our data capture the impact of the initial phase of the outbreak in Norway and can therefore not answer longer-term consequences from either reimposition or lengthening of invasive restrictions.",

Using a non-randomised, non-controlled design to evaluate causations may be reasonable in the pandemic scenario as no other way of assessing the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions exist. However, our results should be interpreted with caution. The deterioration in BPSD could in theory be caused by the progression of the dementia syndrome itself, rather than being exacerbated by the pandemic restrictions. Arguing against this, change in BPSD over 4 months was substantially lesser in an observational cohort of nursing home residents of which the majority had dementia than what we demonstrate comparing prepandemic and pandemic symptom levels. 27 Our findings echo a small body of the existing literature on this topic. A study from Spain noted increases in levels of agitation, apathy, and aberrant motor behaviour 5 weeks into lockdown in outpatients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease (N=40), but no increase in psychotic symptoms. 28 A cross-sectional study from Italy (N=139) describes exacerbation of psychotic symptoms in a small percentage of subjects with subjective cognitive decline, mild cognitive impairment and dementia. 29 This study, in part, used self-assessments, that may have led to underreporting of delusions and hallucinations. Even though other studies are equivocal on whether psychosis worsened, 8 9 UK registry data indicate higher antipsychotic prescription rates to people with dementia during the pandemic, and the authors speculate that this increase may be the result of worsened agitation and psychosis. 30 Meanwhile, our study revealed no associations between psychotropic drugs and psychosis, likely given that very few patients used antipsychotics Open access before the pandemic, in addition to the lack of real-time prescription data throughout the outbreak. Because this is a nascent area of research, discrepancies may be attributed to heterogeneity in design, as well as dementia severity and aetiology.",

[8] [9] [10] For better communication within and between dyads and their formal caregivers, digital devices may enhance individual support. 12 Further, anxiolytics and hypnotics/sedatives were associated with fewer depressive symptoms when used as-needed in our sample. These drugs are known to temporarily alleviate some Open access of the symptoms assessed by the CSDD, such as anxiety, irritability and agitation. However, in line with national guidelines, we rather recommend that antidepressants are considered if severe symptoms persist. 31 Our study supports the WHO's concerns that the pandemic would negatively impact the mental health of people with cognitive impairments. 5 Even though way of life varies globally, the policies implemented in response to COVID-19 are likely equally disruptive to the environment of home-dwelling people with dementia across nations. 3 We, therefore, argue that our findings are generalisable to other countries. Furthermore, they emphasise that non-pharmacological approaches still should be the first-line treatment to avoid BPSD deterioration regardless of context.",
