However, ways that the educational discourse on discrete mathematics can benefit from the inclusion of examples of mathematical modelling and the accompanying discussion are currently under-researched. In this paper, we elaborate on the educational potential of examples of mathematical modelling based on the usage of methods from discrete mathematics, with a focus on secondary education. We first describe vertex-edge graphs as possible topics of discrete mathematics that are accessible at school level within modelling lessons. Secondly, in the context of a case study, we describe modelling activities with students at the end of lower-secondary education, using a classical problem of discrete mathematics originating from the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem. The students' solution processes for this optimisation problem based on graph theory are described. Their approaches are examined referring to the phases of the modelling cycle, using the method of qualitative content analysis. We studied in particular the extent to which students use concepts related to vertex-edge graphs in specific sub-phases of the modelling process. The analysis allows the required sub-competences of modelling to be identified and the connection of these competences with discrete mathematics to be worked out. On the basis of this analysis, educational opportunities of teaching discrete mathematics and mathematical modelling are assessed. Overall, we point out the possibilities and opportunities for using examples from the field of discrete mathematics to acquire modelling competences and to foster the linkage of mathematical modelling and discrete mathematics at school level.",

Using discrete mathematics methods allows for a broader-and in part less formal-approach to working with mathematical models, since, for example, the concept of infinity can initially be avoided. Limits and infinity usually create high learning barriers and epistemological problems for secondary school students or for students at university (Goldin, 2004) . Methods of discrete mathematics in connection with competence in mathematical modelling should be an essential part of a modern curriculum (Hart & Martin, 2018) , as discrete mathematics is considered to have high value in mathematical education (Beutelspacher & Zschiegner, 2014) .",

This analysis leads to the question of the role of discrete ideas concerning students' modelling processes. In a case study, we investigated the actual use of these ideas in detail. In this way, the necessary sub-competences of modelling could be identified and connections with discrete mathematics using the example of a graph-theoretical problem could be worked out, to show opportunities and possibilities for promoting the link between mathematical modelling and discrete mathematics in school, thereby potentially strengthening the teaching and learning of both discrete mathematics and mathematical modeling.",

In these contributions, teaching proposals with discrete models of growth behaviour, graph theory and difference equations were presented from a modelling perspective. In the educational discussion over the following decades, empirical studies were carried out that integrated mathematical modelling and discrete mathematics, and researchers pointed out that discrete mathematics would be indispensable for a modern curriculum (Hart & Martin, 2018) .",

            "text": "According to Pollak (1977, p. 255 ff.) , mathematical modelling refers to a specific aspect of applied mathematics that is currently described using repeated work through a modelling cycle. The modelling cycle describes the expected activities of students and provides metacognitive help (Stillman, 2011) . Currently, there exist many descriptions of the expected modelling activities by students. One detailed modelling cycle was developed by Kaiser and Stender (2013) , whose application is described as an example in a case study in the second part of the paper. However, it should be noted that there exist many nuances of the modelling cycle that we cannot unpack due to space limitations (for a detailed overview, see, e.g., Kaiser, 2017) . In this modelling cycle, the process of the model's individual development from an initial real-world situation to the actual model is presented as the first phase, which usually includes several simplification steps. This modelling phase is followed by translation into mathematics, from which a mathematical model is developed. With the help of this model, a mathematical solution is then determined, and this finally has to be related to the real problem again by interpreting and validating a solution in the original real-world situation (see Fig. 1 ). This modelling cycle describes the various sub-processes of mathematical modelling, such as understanding and simplifying, in more detail than modelling cycles from applied mathematics (e.g., Ortlieb, 2004; Pohjolainen & Heili\u00f6, 2016 ). An important construct within the modelling discourse is the competence of students across various educational levels in modelling. This competence enables them to identify a problem in a real-world situation, translate it into mathematics and interpret and validate a solution in relation to the given situation (Niss et al., 2007, p. 12) . Modelling competence also refers to the willingness to work on mathematical modelling problems through mathematical means, and it is therefore distinguished from ability (Kaiser, 2007; Maa\u00df, 2006) .",

Currently, the advantages of discrete mathematics for mathematics teaching are seen on three levels, namely, the \"content, process, and affect goals of mathematics education\" (Hart & Martin, 2018, p. 18 ). The first level consists of the content, which is also evident in the analysis of new, interesting, and relevant contexts.

The possibility of using challenging problems that are at the same time easy to understand is emphasised (Anderson et al., 2004) . In addition to many inner-mathematical problems from number theory, suggestions from coding theory have also been developed, such as on the EAN and ISBN systems. For secondary school, and partly also for primary school, graph theory in particular is highlighted as a possible subject area, as it is easily accessible for students at nearly all grades, and represents new content outside the curriculum that can be worked on without prerequisites (Gibson, 2012) . By using graphical representations, graph theory may be as intuitively accessible as certain algebraic problems (Steele, 2008) . Students are often able intuitively to suggest mathematical generalisations (Amit & Neria, 2008) . Even more mathematically complex concepts such as Euler paths-i.e., edge sequences of a vertex-edge graph in which each edge is traversed exactly once without the start and end nodes having to be identical-can be easily taught with the help of illustrative problems. Vertex-edge graphs are therefore currently introduced to students as young as 12 years old (van den Heuvel & Krabbendam, 1991) . Successful examples described for mathematics teaching use a variety of mathematical ideas from, among others, elementary graph theory, including complete vertex-edge graphs and Euler paths (Street & Street, 1998) . In universities, the results of an empirical study suggested that the inclusion of graph theory in mathematics teaching would be beneficial for the development of students' modelling skills (Medov\u00e1 et al., 2019) . For teaching mathematics at school, graph algorithms in particular are suggested, also with the inclusion of visualisation through technology. For example, the questions of how optimally to drive a rubbish collection car (Geschke et al., 2005) or how to evacuate a building (Ruzika et al., 2017) are addressed with spreadsheet analysis and dynamic geometry. The examples also show another potential of discrete mathematics and mathematical modelling in dealing with optimization problems that have traditionally been solved with functional descriptions and calculus. Optimization problems are easily accessible and of high practical relevance, and have motivational power for students. There is a large number of examples of combinatorial optimization problems for students in discrete mathematics (DeBellis & Rosenstein, 2004; Schuster, 2004) . The advantages of this topic are also seen especially at the second and third levels, that is in the process-oriented acquisition of competences and affect-related goals. In this context, the promotion of students' motivation is emphasised and the connection of mathematics with real life is considered important (Ferrarello & Mammana, 2018).",

Understanding how computers and their applications work requires knowledge of discrete mathematics in the context of modelling (Pollak, 2007) . In the context of teaching discrete mathematics, the singular possibilities offered by technology have been pointed out (Durcheva & Varbanova, 2017; Weigand, 2004 Weigand, , 2014 . This is also the case in the context of mathematical modelling (e.g., Greefrath et al., 2018; Keune & Henning, 2003; Sinclair & Jackiw, 2010) . In this regard, some empirical results have already been reported (Hankeln & Greefrath, 2021) . For example, in a case study, Greefrath and Siller (2017) observed students working on a reality-based task with GeoGebra. They studied the phases of the modelling cycle in which digital tools were used, and the activities that were carried out using these tools, during modelling activities. They found out that the use of digital tools took place mainly within the phases of mathematising and mathematical work. In the context of a short experiment to investigate the potential of introducing complex dynamical systems into curricula, it was shown that the transition to working with a computer simulation system would require one or more types of processes of discretisation, for example, referring to time or space (Caron, 2019) . Already as early as in the 1980s, Ziegenbalg (1984) emphasised the usage of discrete models in the context of computer simulation in mathematics education.",

It is a particular strength of the problem used that graph-theoretical concepts such as Euler path have a direct correspondence in the real problem (optimal path). Effectiveness can be seen here as a connecting element between mathematical and real models and, in this context, it establishes an interesting link between modelling and discrete problems.

This aspect can be of great importance from a mathematical perspective because it is precisely the structure of the nodes that is important in the classification of different vertex-edge graphs (for example, in the Euler path). On the one hand, it can be seen that this was a challenging problem that was at the same time easy to understand (Anderson et al., 2004) , but on the other hand, its content was not fully exploited (low 'floor' \u2026 high 'ceiling'-tasks; Ingram et al., 2020, p. 500) . However, it must be considered that the students had no prior knowledge of this area of graph theory but developed these ideas and concepts only during the course of working on their task. It should be noted here that graph theory content is not part of the curriculum at German schools. Therefore, it is not surprising that students have no prior knowledge in this area (Kaiser et al., 2011) . In contrast, the teaching of modelling competences is mandatory in Germany. This may explain why the students did not use more complex graph theoretic content (for example, Euler's Theorem on Euler paths). The fact that they used these concepts at all well could be due to the easy accessibility (Gibson, 2012) or also to the intuitive approach, which, as observed in other areas, allows independent generalisations (Amit & Neria, 2008; Steele, 2008) .

The transcript excerpts presented above show, for example, that the discussion about roads that have to be covered twice has to be explored mathematically on one's own first. With further knowledge about graph theory, the students could have directly accessed mathematical models and gone more deeply into the topic. The work could therefore have been more fruitful at both the content level and the process level. At the same time, it is remarkable that students without prior knowledge of graph theory and experience of working with it developed and used so many concepts related to vertex-edge graphs. This could also be seen in the intuitive approach of the students shown above, based on a drawing in the city map. This shows the specific potential of graph theory for mathematics teaching, which, in combination with open modelling problems, opens up access to a completely new mathematical subject area. Overall, this points to the mutual benefit of teaching modelling through discrete mathematics and the benefit of teaching discrete mathematics through modelling.",

            "text": "When looking at the sub-phases of the modelling cycles and concepts related to vertex-edge graphs, the differences between the groups become even more evident. It becomes clear that the references to vertex-edge graphs occurred less, for example, during the understanding phase than over the later course of the modelling process. There were also group-specific sub-phases in which references to vertexedge graphs did not occur at all. By analysing the modelling phases and concepts of graphs jointly, specific students' difficulties could be identified that could not be seen by examining the usage of vertex-edge graphs alone. For example, it was possible to determine the phase of the solution process at which the graph-theoretical aspects occurred or were missing. The analysis revealed the most important problematic aspects and topics students encountered. Based on these results, intervention methods for further modelling activities with graph-theoretical problems can be developed as scaffolding measures (Stender & Kaiser, 2015) . Due to its process character, the modelling perspective offers the possibility for controlling the solution processes at the metalevel by using metacognitive aids (Beckschulte, 2020; Stillman, 2011; Vorh\u00f6lter, Kr\u00fcger, et al., 2019) . For example, in the intuitive approach described above, a metacognitive aid to search for the mathematical model could open the view in the direction of more abstract generalisations. The modelling perspective thus offers the opportunity to describe the process character of developing answers to the original problems based on carrying out a modelling cycle (Kaiser & Stender, 2013) and its sub-processes, in addition to looking at the content of the students' solution processes. This allows feedback to be provided to the students or focus to be placed on metacognitive strategies (Vorh\u00f6lter, Kr\u00fcger, et al., 2019) .",

Further investigations with other modelling examples-also from other areas of discrete mathematics-and more students will be necessary to expand the scope of the study.

However, they do offer the potential to stimulate substantial mathematical reflections and also to motivate students with the help of real-world experiences. Such problems are therefore very interesting as content for mathematics education and offer the opportunity to introduce students to optimization problems already early in their school career. At the same time, the study showed that intensive and different modelling processes were stimulated and carried out. So, from a modelling perspective, examples like the one used in this study are of high educational value. In addition, the students were motivated and mathematically active during the long processing periods of several hours over the two days. This also shows the potential to promote high motivation through suitable modelling problems (Ferrarello & Mammana, 2018) . Thus, the advantages of discrete mathematics for mathematics teaching may be exemplified across three levels (Hart & Martin, 2018) , namely, interesting content (the example from graph theory), the development of process-related competences (concerning modelling competences) and the level of affect-related goals (motivation).",
