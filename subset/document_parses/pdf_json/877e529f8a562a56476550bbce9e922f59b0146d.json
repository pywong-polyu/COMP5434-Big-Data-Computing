The concentration of ozone was found to be increased during the lockdown period in other parts of world Jain and Sharma 2020 ). In the current study, the maximum percentage of increase (45%) in O 3 was witnessed in Kota. In order to understand the unlikely trend in the change in concentration of ozone, let us see the photochemical reactions responsible for formation of ozone in the atmosphere (Fig. 3c) . Nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are referred as ozone precursors. The ambient concentration of ozone is governed by the mentioned precursors, temperature, solar radiations, wind speed, and other meteorological factors. As reported, ozone is produced by a complex reaction taking place among NOx and VOCs in the presence of sunlight (Srivastava et al. 2005; Lee et al. 2002) . The present study area is urban part and thus falls under VOC-limited region of the country (Seinfeld and Pandis 1998) . In a VOClimited environment, the ozone accumulation is directed by the chemistry between the anthropogenic emission of NOx and ozone, beside the meteorological factors (Saini et al. 2017) . Thus, the increase in concentration of ozone during lockdown period could be correlated to increased solar radiation and decrease NO 2 owing to favorability of the photochemical reaction (Fig. 4) . More than 75% of nitrogen is released from activities like agriculture, transport (fossil-fuel combustion), and industries [17] , and during lockdown, there was a restriction in all the mentioned sectors, leading to lowering of the concentration of NOx emissions in VOC-limited environment, which could be correlated to the increase in concentration of ozone in most of the selected cities (Kim et al. 2018; Sicard et al. 2020; Shrestha et al. 2020; Sharma et al. 2016) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 237, "end": 257, "text": "Jain and Sharma 2020", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 901, "end": 925, "text": "(Srivastava et al. 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 926, "end": 942, "text": "Lee et al. 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1037, "end": 1063, "text": "(Seinfeld and Pandis 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1234, "end": 1253, "text": "(Saini et al. 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1577, "end": 1581, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1844, "end": 1861, "text": "(Kim et al. 2018;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1862, "end": 1881, "text": "Sicard et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1903, "text": "Shrestha et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1904, "end": 1923, "text": "Sharma et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 529, "end": 538, "text": "(Fig. 3c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 1443, "end": 1451, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Results and discussion"}, {"text": "It is also documented that decrease in the concentration of PM causes more infiltration of solar radiation through the atmosphere.
