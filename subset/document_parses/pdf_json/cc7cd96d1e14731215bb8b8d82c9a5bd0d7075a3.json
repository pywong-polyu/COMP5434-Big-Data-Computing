Online forward triage tools (OFTTs) provide useful information, direct patients and free physician resources. We implemented an OFTT targeted at the current pandemic, adapted the content and goals and assessed its effects. The OFTT was implemented on 2 March 2020 and modified regularly based on the revised testing criteria issued by the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health. After testing criteria liberalised, a chatbot tool was set up on 9 April 2020 to assess urgency of testing, referral to available testing sites and need for emergency care. In the first 40 days of the OFTT, there were more than 17 300 visitors and 69.8% indicated they would have contacted the healthcare system if the online test had not been available. During the initial week of operation, using the conservative testing strategy, 9.1% of visitors received recommendations to be tested, which increased to 36.0% of visitors after a change in testing criteria on 9 March 2020. Overall, since the implementation of the tool, 26.27% of all users of the site have been directed to obtain testing. The Chatbot tool has had approximately 50 consults/day. Setting up an OFTT should be considered as part of local strategies to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. It may ease the burden on the healthcare system, reassure patients and inform authorities. To account for the dynamic development of the pandemic, frequent adaptation of the tool is of great importance. Further research on clinical outcomes of OFTT is urgently needed.",

In addition to identifying the rapidly increasing number of infected people and caring for the sick, the system needs to attend to anxious and potentially misinformed citizens. New information about the disease emerges daily. As a result of this, and changes in the testing capacity of health services, guidelines have been adjusted frequently during the pandemic. It is difficult, therefore, for physicians and patients to maintain currency with respect to these changing guidelines. Thus an online forward triage tool (OFTT) may provide a current, credible and practical source of information for patients and physicians, direct patients to the correct level of care and free physician resources for sicker patients. 1 The requirements for such an OFTT in terms of timeliness and flexibility in adapting to changing guidelines are high and represent a major challenge in operating such an instrument.",

During the first months of the pandemic, the test recommendation in Switzerland was based on known contact with a patient with COVID-19 and history of travel to affected areas (Italy). During the course of the pandemic, the recommendation changed to a risk group based testing strategy (testing in healthcare professionals, patients>65 years and patients with pre-existing conditions such as hypertension). These test recommendations of the Federal Office for Public Health (FOPH) were immediately implemented in our tool. With increasing spread of the virus and increases in testing capacities, testing criteria in Switzerland, issued by the FOPH on a national level, changed to a very liberal testing regime (now providing free testing for everyone with even the slightest symptoms or minimal contacts to confirmed cases). This limited our initial approach to provide a recommendation regarding the indication for testing.",

For a large number of users, the risk of infection from unnecessary travel and exposure to potentially ill patients at testing sites may have been avoided and the healthcare system relieved of unnecessary consultations. The very high acceptance among general practitioners and dentists as indicated by the large number of patients referred to the OFTT underlines the professionals' need for advice. On a macro level, analysis of user responses can identify what changes in FOPH testing criteria are responsible for what change in recommendations and support authorities in balancing testing criteria and capacity. Analyses of user location may further inform dynamic regional allocation of testing capacities, help target interventions for education and information and localise hot spots of COVID-19.",
