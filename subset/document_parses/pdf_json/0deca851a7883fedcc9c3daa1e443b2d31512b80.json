The public health emergency and COVID-19 pandemic regulations in New York City required a novel workflow to sustain existing operations. While regulatory enforcement discretions offered faculty workspace flexibility, a substantial portion of laboratory and digital pathology workflows require on-site presence of staff. Maintaining social distancing and offering staggered work schedules. Due to a decrease in patients seeking health care at the onset of the pandemic, a temporary decrease in patient specimens was observed. Hospital and travel regulations impacted onsite vendor technical support. Digital glass slide scanning activities onsite proceeded without interruption throughout the pandemic, with challenges including staff who required quarantine due to virus exposure, unrelated illness, family support, or lack of public transportation. During the public health emergency, we validated digital pathology systems for a remote pathology operation. Since March 2020, the departmental digital pathology staff were able to maintain scanning volumes of over 100 000 slides per month. The digital scanning team reprioritized archival slide scanning and participated in a remote sign-out validation and successful submission of New York State approval for a laboratory developed test. Digital pathology offers a health care delivery model where pathologists can perform their sign out duties at remote location and prevent disruptions to critical pathology services for patients seeking care at our institution during emergencies. Development of standard operating procedures to support digital workflows will maintain turnaround times and enable clinical operations during emergency or otherwise unanticipated events.",

Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center (MSKCC) is a large tertiary care center with 514 beds and 560 000 outpatient visits a year in its main hospital in Manhattan and 19 ambulatory sites across the states of New York and New Jersey. The hospital had to respond effectively to the viral spread with leadership needed to quickly adapt operations to support patients and staff. Patients with cancer are among those most vulnerable to severe illness from respiratory viral infections. 1,2 By April 10, 2020, New York State had 9385 reported deaths, and patients with cancer comprised 8.4% of deceased individuals. 3 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center had developed polymerase chain reaction testing for COVID-19 by March 10, 2020. 3, 4 From March 10 until May 7, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in 946 patients at MSKCC. 3 During the peak pandemic days, patient positivity rate had a rate of 4.3% that fell below 0.3% after April 2020. 4 Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer center utilized the Hospital Incident Command System (HICS) to coordinate essential services and assign responsibilities during emergencies. This system was integrated with local, state, and federal incident command processes and includes representation from all stakeholders in the organization. The system was fully activated in March 2020 with daily staff updates.",

Digital pathology is a disruptive technology such that there is an additional time requiring step for each glass slide that is needed before case distribution to the trainees or pathologists. Modifying workflows and training for staff was required to minimize delays in turnaround time. Downtime periods where slides were traditionally being collated with their respective cases or awaiting review overnight were used for digital scanning efforts to show no difference in slide distribution or case reporting turnaround time. As a result, histotechnologists were trained to load and operate basic functionality on the high throughput whole slide scanners, whereas the digital scan team offered troubleshooting and technical support as needed, in addition to both teams providing QC checks on the glass slides and whole slide images. An effort was made to increase the likelihood of successful first time scans. The laboratory histology workflow was modified and staff was provided best practices to facilitate digital scanning efforts, such as centering of tissue during embedding and sectioning, ensuring tissue is not present at the edge or past glass slide coverslips, and allowing time for racks to fully dry before being loaded into the whole slide scanners.",

These values were compared to median turnaround time that was measured for the year 2019 and for June 2020, the month preceding prospective biopsy glass slide scanning. The analysis demonstrates there was no significant delay in the time from case accession to first slide of case available for distribution and case accession to last slide of case available for distribution from the laboratory baseline compared to after prospective clinical scanning (3.8% and 3.7%, respectively). The delay was likely due to the incremental time of scanning the glass slides, however altogether, the total time from case accessioning to final report signout decreased by 4.3% from 2019 to August 2020 following the prospective scanning workflow adoption in clinical practice. Not all cases were reported digitally; however, these data show that prospective scanning of glass slides were able to maintain turnaround times even with the additive scanning workflow.",

Most expressed the conflict of not staying with their families at home. During the study period, 14 individuals took newly requested or previously planned vacation days ranging from 1 day to 22 consecutive days. In total, there were 96 vacation days that were taken by the team members with 3 individuals responsible for 56 of those days. These individuals used their vacation days early on after the lockdown to avoid coming to the hospital for fear of being infected and/or infecting their family members. In an effort to minimize potential employee work exposure to the virus, the team management followed World Health Organization 8 and MSKCC HICS recommendations to modify operations to minimize staff who is present onsite and allow more social distancing for employees. Digital scan team members' workstations were rearranged with more spacing between stations for social distancing, and the work areas were decluttered to allow better cleaning and sanitation practices. Employee schedules were modified to allow flexible work to all employees based on their family and transportation needs when possible. Two digital scan associates chose to work 12 hour shifts, 3 days a week. Two chose 10 hour shifts, 4 days a week. Tasks that did not require onsite presence were identified and allowed to have a staggered rotation among senior personnel with 1 to 2 individuals working from home every day, and the other starting their workday at 5, 7, or 8 AM. As a result of this effort, scanner use was expanded and included late afternoon and evening scans allowing greater use of current equipment.",

Protecting and maintaining staff health and morale were a top priority for managers and administrators at MSKCC throughout this period.

However, as previously described for clinical pathology 12 and cytopathology, 13 pathology laboratory and digital pathology workflows require on-site presence of staff for most of the steps involved ( Figure 1 ) and planning and precautions have to be taken to ensure operations in situations that required minimized onsite staffing.
