However, our framework is easily adaptable to epidemic models with more disease stages, such as COVID-19 models [5] . We consider as input an (undirected, unweighted) contact network with n nodes and a budget k (number of vaccines). The goal is to identify those k (susceptible) nodes which, when vaccinated, reduce the spread of the epidemic the most. We measure this by using the expected number of susceptible nodes in the terminal state, where the epidemic is over and all nodes are either susceptible, recovered, or vaccinated. In most cases, the only numerically feasible way to approximate this number is to perform a large number of stochastic simulations.",

Intuitively, it is often a good decision to vaccinate those nodes with a large number of neighbors (or with a high centrality in the network) and those which are close to the initially infected nodes. If possible, it is even better to identify those nodes which lie between the initially infected nodes and many susceptible nodes. If we represent the spreading process by a transmission tree (cf. Fig. 1 ), in which the direct children of a node v correspond to those nodes that were infected by v, the size of a v's subtree gives the number of multi-hop infections that originated from v. The premise of our work is that the number of multi-hop infections of a node is a good indicator of whether that node is a good vaccination candidate.",

This allows performing a large number of simulation runs of networks with millions of nodes and edges in the order of minutes on a standard desktop PC. Based on many simulations, Simba constructs a transmission graph, a generalization of the transmission tree for several simulation runs. By analyzing this graph, we obtain an impact score for every node. Repeated evaluation of the current vaccination strategy and re-computation of the impact scores yields an iterative optimization procedure, whose objective is to maximize the expected number of nodes that remain healthy.",

Let G = (V, E) be an undirected, unweighted graph with node set V = {v 1 , . . . , v n }, containing n nodes, and an edge set E and let any L : V \u2192 {S, I, R} be a node labeling that assigns a node state to each node (corresponding to susceptible, infected and recovered nodes). We assume that G is connected (i.e., all nodes are reachable from all other nodes) and has no selfloops. Each labeling function corresponds to a joint state (i.e., a superposition of all node states), called network state. The network dynamics specify how the network state (i.e., the labeling) changes over time. We use L init to denote the labeling of the initial network state and we use S init (I init , R init ) to denote those nodes that were susceptible (infected, recovered) in L init . Network Dynamics. We also assume that an infection rate constant \u03bb \u2208 R >0 and a recovery rate constant \u03bc \u2208 R >0 are given. W.l.o.g. we typically assume \u03bc = 1 and only vary \u03bb as the spreading dynamics is determined by the fraction \u03bb \u03bc . The network state evolves according to a race condition between nodes and edges. Generally, all infected nodes can recover at rate \u03bc and each S-I edge can transmit an infection at rate \u03bb, causing the susceptible node to become infected. Consequently, a (computationally naive but statistically correct) simulation run is performed by starting with L init and then, in each simulation step, drawing a firing time for each I-node and for each S-I edge which are exponentially distributed with rates \u03bc and \u03bb, respectively. The event with the shortest firing time \"wins\" and the corresponding node state (label) is changed accordingly. Repeatedly applying these rules will always lead to a terminal labeling or network state where no more actions are possible (all nodes are recovered or susceptible). Given a random simulation run, we use the term transmission tree (cf. Fig. 1 ) to describe a tree where patient zero is the root (if there are more than one infected nodes in the beginning, we merge them) and every node that became infected during the course of the epidemic is connected to the node which infected it. Thus, all nodes in the subtree of a node are called its children, i.e. they were directly or indirectly infected by that node.",

For the initialization, we create one recovery event and one infection event for each infected node and push them into the queue. The firing time is exponentially distributed with rate \u03bc (recovery event) and rate \u03bb \u00b7 d i (infection from node v i , d i being the number of v i 's neighbors). In each simulation step, we take the first event from the queue. If it is a recovery event, we simply set the corresponding node to state R. If it is an infection event, we first check if the corresponding node is still in state I, if not, we reject the event and proceed with the next step. If it is, we pick a random neighbor, which will be the target of the infection. We check if the random neighbor is susceptible. If it is, we set the neighbor to I and create two events (recovery and infection) for the newly infected neighbor. We also create a new infection event for the source node. Then, we proceed with the next step. The simulation ends when there are no more nodes in state I. We store the number of susceptible nodes when the simulation ends. Moreover, each time a node gets infected, we store from which (infected) neighbor the infection originated (or all nodes it could have originated from, cf. Sect. 4.2).",

The reason why they differ is that if we vaccinate a node, all of its children in the transmission tree can still become infected via alternative paths. In this sense, the impact score gives an over-approximation on the effect of vaccinating a node regarding the objective. Colloquially, if we vaccinate a node with m children (on average), then the best we can hope for is that these m nodes do not become infected. Hence, our optimization procedure picks nodes depending on their theoretical (and over-approximated) capability or potential to reduce the epidemic spreading. The best node to vaccinate depends on the dynamics. If \u03bb is small, the infection will die out on its own in the line graph and it makes more sense to protect the FCC even though it contains fewer nodes.

It is easy to see this in the example in Fig. 4 where we have a single patient zero and a budget of k = 1. We can either vaccinate the node to the \"right\" to protect the fully connected component (FCC) with six nodes or we can vaccinate the node to the \"left\" to protect the line-graph with nine nodes.

PageRank (personalized PageRank) [7, 24] , and Degree (pick nodes with highest degree). We use 10 3 simulations runs for each construction of the transmission tree. We also analyze the runtime of a complete construction and solution of a transmission graph based on d-regular random graphs (i.e., all nodes have exactly d neighbors) with varying degree d and n. Practically, the runtime is almost linear in n. Theoretically, the number of simulation steps in each run increases linearly. The costs of each simulation step increase sub-linearly. The costs of solving the DTMC also increase linearly. We see that, even though the number of iteration steps is quite small, Simba is superior to or (almost) on par with the baselines in the experiments. Simba struggles the most with BA graph which is a special case but important as it highlights potential problems. It seems that the general strategy of Simba to separate the initially infected from the susceptible nodes does not work better than identifying the nodes which are generally important for the graph's resilience against epidemics. This is due to the fact that BA graphs typically possess a small subset of nodes that are extremely effective candidates for vaccination regardless of the infection source.",

Unlike other methods, our approach is based on statistically correct simulations which are analyzed using the transmission graph. The transmission graph represents the flow of a pathogen in the network as a directed weighted graph. The method is suitable for all epidemic models that can be simulated efficiently.",

Moreover, we want to extend numerical evaluations to more complex spreading models (e.g., non-Markovian, multi-state ones) and network types (e.g., adaptive networks).",
