Overcrowded places such as urban slums and camps of forcibly displaced populations were of particular concern. In these settings, in addition to population density, higher transmissibility could occur due to larger household sizes, intense social mixing between the young and elderly, inadequate water and sanitation, and specific cultural and faith practices [2] . This has not materialized in most camps of forcibly displaced people, where the number of reported cases and deaths has been much lower than feared [1] . The low numbers have been attributed to limited testing capacity, differences in the population structure with a small proportion of elderly at high risk of severe disease and death, a predominance of asymptomatic and pauci-symptomatic infections, early implementation of confinement [3] , social structure leading to different epidemic dynamics [4] , or other unknown factors associated with this population and the context.

This was not possible based on symptom onset, given the long recall period, and given the fact that not all participants reported symptoms. Therefore, one of the seropositive persons in the household was randomly selected as the first infected; then this was repeated 1000 times to obtain the relative risk, its confidence interval, and its p-value. Seroprevalence results were standardized by age group with an age distribution identified in a survey conducted in 2018 by MSF (see S1 File). The proportion of inhabitants was estimated for each five-year age group, then the results were wighted for each individual tested with the inverse of this proportion using the R Survey package (Version 4.0).

All study procedures involving subject's participation were conducted in compliance with the principles enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki. Mortality monitoring is part of the routine tasks of CHWs; our activity consisted of strengthening this aspect. Nevertheless, as the mortality survey was part of our study, we sought verbal informed consent from every household, with the designated head of household answering the questionnaire for all relevant members of the household. For the seroprevalence component, written informed consent was sought from all individuals willing to participate. In the case of minors aged between eight to 17 years, participation was proposed for both the minor and the legal guardian. Both the assent of the minor and the consent of the legal guardian were needed for inclusion. In the case of minors below eight years of age, the decision to participate was made solely by the legal guardian. Participant privacy was respected throughout the study.",

Respondents reported to CHWs that 39% of deaths occurred in the hospital (42% in the pre-pandemic period and 36% in the pandemic period). During this period, 221 deaths were recorded in the hospital (140 pre-pandemic deaths and 81 pandemic deaths). Assuming the hospital database is complete and the proportion of in-hospital deaths reported to CHWs is representative, the projection gives 557 deaths (333 pre-pandemic deaths and 224 pandemic deaths), compared to 407 deaths reported to CHWs (200 pre-pandemic and 207 pandemic). This calculation suggests that the survey may have underestimated the mortality rate by 37%; moreover, it suggests that the underestimation was more important in the prepandemic period than in the pandemic period (66% versus 3%). Lastly, this increase could be an artefact, as households that would have left the camp during the recall period could not be included.",

This occurred in tandem with a sustained decline in attendance to health facilities despite the easing of restrictions. Initiatives to restore the population's confidence and access to health care are urgently needed. Furthermore, this study took place in a stable refugee camp with relatively good baseline access to health care as shown by the low CMR. The situation of the more than 80 million forcibly displaced people in the world varies greatly; this merits further research in other sites to assess their situation. Importantly, only large-scale vaccination of the population can limit the risk of excess mortality from COVID-19.",

As of the start of the study on 3 March 2021, 106,470 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Kenya including 1,863 deaths (source World Health Organization -WHO). Based on the 2019 national census, this corresponds to an attack rate of 0.22% and 3.9 COVID-19 related deaths per 100,000 population. The first confirmed case of COVID-19 in Dagahaley camp was identified on 16 May 2020. Few cases were reported in Dagahaley camp in May and June 2020; then a first peak occurred in September and a second increase started in February 2021. As of 3 March 2021, 940 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) tests had been performed in Dagahaley camp, confirming 47 positive cases, including 3 deaths.",
