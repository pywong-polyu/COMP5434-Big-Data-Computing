While the RT-PCR kits are available in sufficient quantity in several countries, others are facing challenges with limited availability of testing kits and processing centers in remote areas. This has motivated researchers to find alternate methods of testing which are reliable, easily accessible and faster. Chest X-Ray is one of the modalities that is gaining acceptance as a screening modality. Towards this direction, the paper has two primary contributions. Firstly, we present the COVID-19 Multi-Task Network which is an automated end-to-end network for COVID-19 screening. The proposed network not only predicts whether the CXR has COVID-19 features present or not, it also performs semantic segmentation of the regions of interest to make the model explainable. Secondly, with the help of medical professionals, we manually annotate the lung regions of 9000 frontal chest radiographs taken from ChestXray-14, CheXpert and a consolidated COVID-19 dataset. Further, 200 chest radiographs pertaining to COVID-19 patients are also annotated for semantic segmentation. This database will be released to the research community.",

Since the explainability of machine learning systems, particularly for medical applications, is of paramount importance, the proposed network also incorporates the task of lung and disease segmentation. The proposed CMTNet simultaneously processes the input X-ray for semantic lung segmentation, disease localization, and healthy/unhealthy classification. Incorporating additional tasks while performing the primary task of COVID classification has multiple advantages. While processing for COVID classification, the additional segmentation tasks enforce the network to focus on lung regions and disease-affected areas only. Further, inclusion of healthy/unhealthy classification aids the CMTNet to effectively identify a healthy lung. Further, assistance from other tasks reduces dependence on enormous amounts of data required during training. The key research highlights of this work are as follows:",

Apostolopoulos and Mpesiana [4] explored transfer learning through various CNNs and observed that MobileNet v2 [5] yields the best results. Narin et al. [6] proposed to use three CNN models, namely, ResNet50 [7] , InceptionV3 [8] , and InceptionResNetV2 [9] for detecting COVID-19 using chest x-ray. The authors fine-tuned these pre-trained deep models for distinguishing COVID-19 from normal x-rays and found that ResNet-50 performed the best. They used 50 chest x-ray images of COVID-19 patients from Github repository [10] and 50 normal chest X-ray images [11] . Abbas et al. [12] also performed transfer learning by fine-tuning a pre-trained AlexNet [13] . Their dataset comprises 80 normal, 105 COVID-19, and 11 SARS affected lung radiographs. Cohen et al. [14] predicted the severity score for COVID-19 using a deep regression model. Apart from healthy and Non-COVID disease affected frontal lung x-ray, their dataset included 94 COVID-19 affected lung x-rays (all PA views). Oh et al.

It could potentially overcome the challenges of limited test kits and speed up the screening process of COVID-19 cases. However, a significant limitation of existing studies is that the algorithms work as a black box. These algorithms predict if the input x-ray is affected by COVID-19 or some related disease. Most studies fail to explain the decisions -for instance, which lung regions are salient for the specific decisions. Secondly, existing studies do not focus on radiological abnormalities such as consolidation, opacities, or pneumothorax. Without a clear emphasis on the lung or the abnormality, it is hard to have the explainability of an algorithm in a crucial application of COVID-19 diagnosis. Further, most of these studies work with a limited number of COVID-19 samples, with around 100 samples under most scenarios. Thirdly, as shown in Fig. 1(b) , the posteroanterior (PA) and anteroposterior (AP) views of CXR images vary due to the acquisition mechanisms. While training, samples from both classes need to be considered but existing algorithms are generally silent on these details.",

These tasks are accomplished by using five loss functions: two for segmentation and three for classification. The details of these loss functions are described in the following subsections.

On the other hand, SegNet and CMTNet provide irregularly shaped predictions, localizing the radiological findings compactly. Overall, we observe that each of the four algorithms predict additional regions for the abnormalities.

            "text": "Further, we observe that for certain abnormalities in 'Unheathy' case, deep models fail to localize the abnormality. One of the reasons for this is the limited training data for abnormality localization with large variations in the diseased regions. The unhealthy Non-COVID lung abnormalities are derived from ChestXray-14, which has 700 samples corresponding to 14 labels. As a result of a small sample size for each abnormality, the networks cannot localize diseases properly. However, the proposed CMTNet has assistance from other tasks. For instance, the lung prediction task would implicitly reinforce CMTNet to predict diseases within the lung. Hence, of the four algorithms, the proposed CMTNet provides the most overlapping prediction with the ground truth. Compared to 700 samples for 14+ different radiological findings (approx. 50 images per abnormality), the COVID-19 affected lung x-rays are 290 in number (prior to augmentation). The majority of the COVID-19 affected chest radiographs demonstrate consolidations, which tend to be bilateral and more common in lower zones [35] . Hence, deep models have more samples to learn the localization of COVID-19 specific abnormalities than other diseases (290 vs. 50). In retrospection, the first two rows of Fig. 6 illustrate that all four models perform relatively better for COVID-19 localization than the last two rows of \"unhealthy\" localization. In most cases, each of the four models predict affected regions in the lower lung zones bilaterally. However, the proposed CMTNet outperforms other algorithms. For instance, in the first row of Fig. 6 , both Mask-RCNN and SegNet tend to leave out the darker region in the right lung, while ground-truth and CMTNet have that region marked as diseased. Further, in the low contrast x-ray in row two, the less opaque part of the right lower lung looks darker (though being diseased). Hence, UNet fails to detect any finding in the right lower lung, while Mask RCNN and SegNet detects a few small region(s). Nevertheless, the proposed CMTNet can detect such faint differences in lung density. The same pattern can also be noticed in the low contrast x-ray (row two) of Fig. 2 in the supplementary material.",

For each of these networks, the ImageNet pre-trained version is selected. The model is then fine-tuned with the dataset and protocol used for the proposed CMTNet. Further, we draw a comparison with RDF [37] and SVM [38] with three different kernels (sigmoid, gaussian, and RBF). The training of RDF and SVM is performed using feature embedding of training samples, obtained from the last encoder layer of the CMTNet. The results for classification performance are presented in Table IV . It is observed that the proposed CMTNet achieves a sensitivity of 87.20% at 99% specificity, with an overall test classification accuracy of 98.79%. The proposed CMTNet achieves the highest TPR and lowest EER compared to the existing algorithms. With the implicit supervision from lung and disease localization tasks, the proposed CMTNet outperforms all other existing algorithms. To show the stability of different algorithms with different initialization, the networks are three-times trained with different initialization parameters. Across different training initializations, we report the standard deviation in Sensitivity to evaluate the stability (lower standard deviation implies higher stability). As shown in Fig.  7 , the proposed CMTNet is the most stable algorithm across different initializations. Classifiers that use embeddings from CMTNet also report lower standard deviation. Hence, it can be inferred that CMTNet consistently provides a discriminative representation, resulting in a stable performance. Fig. 8 further shows the comparison using the ROC curves of the proposed CMTNet and existing algorithms.",

Overall, the classification performance of healthy/unhealthy classification is 75.17% for all the test samples, while for Non-COVID disease classification is 73.87%. Based on the proposed CMTNet, Fig. 9 shows some of the misclassified samples where the network predicts COVID-19 positive instances (as per the RT-PCR test) into healthy (Task 3). Correspondingly, the same samples are also predicted as Non-COVID by Task 4 of the proposed CMTNet. In retrospection, we believe that minimal opacities in the lung region could be the probable cause of misclassification. This led us to check the ground truth for the hospitalization day. Of the four misclassified samples shown in Fig. 9 , three turned out to be the early days of the patients hospitalization (up to day 3). Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the CMTNet predicts an x-ray being affected when there is presence of opacities and consolidations.",

With at least one segmentation task included, we perform six different ablation study experiments, which are presented in the six rows of Table V. It is observed that for COVID-19 prediction, each task (loss function) has an important role. Removing either of the three assisting tasks deteriorates the performance. Of all these three assisting tasks, the lung segmentation task holds a pivotal role. In a COVID-19 affected x-ray, a common trait is that the lungs get affected bilaterally. Hence, a comprehensive view provided by the lung segmentation task provides more weight to lung regions, resulting in better performance with Task 1 than any other task. We perform disease segmentation and healthy/unhealthy classification since their efficacy improves in conjunction with lung segmentation and has a positive impact on the Non-COVID disease classification prediction. As validated by the ground-truth t-SNE feature space plot (shown in Fig. 10(a) ), the predictions of the test COVID-19 samples ( Fig. 10(b) ) are well separated from Non-COVID samples.",
