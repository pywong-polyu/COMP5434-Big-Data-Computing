With the development and inclusion of body mass index (BMI)-for-age in the WHO child growth standards, it has become possible to assess over-and undernutrition in short-statured children.

Prevalence of overnutrition in 0-18-year children was calculated from these two surveys by using the WHO standards for BMI-for-age (BMI-for-age z scores (BAZ) > +2 in 0-5 and BAZ > +1 in 5-18-year children) as well as uniform norms of either > +1 or > +2 BAZ across 0-18-year children. An attempt was made to explore the policy and program implications of using different norms for assessing overnutrition in preschool and school age children in the Indian context.

Across 0-18-year children, the mean BMI-for-age of Indian boys and girls was lower than the mean of the WHO standards, but the trajectory followed was similar. Therefore, Indian high-risk under-and overnourished children can be monitored by using the WHO BMI-for-age curve. Irrespective of the cutoff used for BMI-for-age, prevalence of overnutrition was higher in preschool as compared to school-age children. Overnourished school-age children outnumbered preschool children, especially if the WHO cutoffs were used. The school health system may find it difficult to implement programs that aimed at detection and management of large number of overnourished children. If uniform norm of BAZ > +1 was used, prevalence of overnutrition in preschool children was high and almost similar to undernutrition. Currently, nutrition programs for preschool children are focused on undernutrition and they may find it difficult to manage program focused on overnutrition in large number of children.

The country initiated multipronged interventions to reduce poverty, improve household food security, and provide food supplements to vulnerable groups such as pregnant women and children. India has been undergoing socioeconomic, demographic, nutrition, and health transition. In the last two decades, there has been relatively rapid gross domestic product (GDP) growth, rise in per capita income, and reduction in poverty ratio (1, 2). The last four decades had witnessed a substantial reduction in undernutrition rates across all the age groups; however, stunting, underweight, and wasting rates in Indian children are still among the highest in the world (3-15). In addition, the country witnessed an increase in the overnutrition rates in children (10-12, 14, 15) . With the emergence of the dual nutrition burden in India, there was growing concern among public health nutritionists and pediatricians that if the weight for age is used as the indicator for assessing nutritional status, the short-statured Indian children who were overweight for their age and height will not be recognized as overnourished and opportunity to initiate early interventions will be missed.",

Prevalence of wasting and overnutrition in 5-18-year children had also been reported by various agencies, but a comparison of data between countries or periods is difficult because of the use of different criteria (weight for height or BMI-for-age) and different cutoff used for overnutrition (> +2 SD in 0-5 years, > +2 SD in 0-18 years, and > +1 SD in 5-18 years) (20, 21) .

To achieve the SDG targets, India has to undertake programs focusing on prevention, detection, and management of both the under-and overnutrition in children. There are ample data on the prevalence of undernutrition in children, but there is a paucity of data on the prevalence of overnutrition in children. It is essential to have data on the prevalence and number of preschool and school-age children who would need interventions to halt and reverse the rise in overnutrition. In 2013-2014, India carried out two major surveys to assess the nutritional status of 0-18-year children. Data from these surveys were analyzed to calculate the prevalence of overnutrition in children by using the WHO BMI-for-age standards. The results of the data analysis and the potential policy and program implications of using the different BAZ cutoffs for overnutrition in preschool and school-age children in India are discussed in the manuscript.",

The AHS CAB (14) and DLHS 4 (12) undertook height and weight measurements in all the 0-18-year children from households selected for the survey. The sampling frame for the surveys had been prepared by the International Institute for Population Sciences (IIPS), Mumbai and Office of the Registrar General of Registrar General of India (RGI), New Delhi. The survey personnel was paraprofessionals and was trained in administering the survey instruments and taking measurements. All the anthropometric equipment for the survey were centrally procured and tested for accuracy before being sent to the survey agencies. Prior to initiation of the survey, all the paraprofessionals recruited by various agencies undertaking the survey in different states were trained in undertaking measurement of length/height and weight. The length/height measurements in the survey were taken by personnel with required accuracy in measurements. As an internal quality assurance procedure, duplicate measurements were carried out in randomly selected 10% of the children measured. Data from the AHS CAB were obtained from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and data from the DLHS4 were obtained from the IIPS. Data were cleaned and analyzed by using the WHO Anthro and the WHO AnthroPlus software and the SPSS software version 26 (SPSS Incorporation, Chicago, Illinois, USA).",

Taking these into account, the SDG sets a feasible target of halting the rise in overnutrition. All the countries can report changes in overnutrition rates in children by using whatever standards they have been using; the WHO/United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) can monitor the progress toward halting overnutrition, despite the variations between different countries. Efforts to set and use uniform standards for defining overnutrition in 0-18-year children and periodic estimation and reporting of the prevalence of overnutrition across countries are being initiated as a part of the SDG monitoring. While the system was getting organized, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic occurred; the focus shifted to prevention and management of COVID-19 pandemic, pandemic-related increase in food insecurity, and undernutrition. However, the coming years are likely to see a substantial improvement in reporting both the wasting and overnutrition in children by using BMI-for-age standards. This, in turn, will improve the operationalization of focused programs aimed at halting overnutrition in children.",

Till 2007, the WHO/National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) growth standards (22) were used in India for early detection and effective management of undernourished children in pediatric and public health nutrition practice. The WHO-NCHS growth standards defined undernutrition as height-for-age or weight-for-age or weightfor-height of < \u22122 SD; overweight was defined as weightfor-age > +2 SD. Because of the availability of the balances and ease of weighing children, weight-for-age was the most widely used parameter for assessing the nutritional status of children. In hospital settings, weight and height were measured; stunted and underweight children were identified. In settings where accurate age ascertainment was a problem, but height and weight measurement were possible, weight-for-height as an age-independent indicator of nutritional status in children was used for detection of undernutrition. With the emergence of dual nutrition burden, it was recognized that if the WHO/NCHS weight-for-age standards were used, short-statured (e.g., Indian) children who were overweight for their current height will be misclassified as normal or underweight and an opportunity for early detection and effective management of overnutrition will be missed. In the dual nutrition burden era, it was essential to have growth standards that take both the current age and height into account while assessing nutritional status.",

In the harmonized NCHS/MGRS growth curve, across 0-18 years, undernutrition was defined as z-scores of height-, weight-, or BMI-for-age < \u22122. However, BAZ scores for overnutrition varied; in 0-5 years, BAZ > +2, as already defined in the WHO MGRS standards, was used (16) . For 5-18-year children, BAZ of > +1, which coincided with an accepted adult cutoff of BMI 25 for overnutrition was used (17) . As a result, there was an abrupt and substantial difference in the cutoff values for overnutrition for BMI-for-age at 60 months, but the transition from adolescent to adult cutoff BMI for overnutrition was smooth (Figure 3A) .",

Further calculation showed that BMI-for-age is a sigma-shaped curve in the 0-18year age group (Figures 1, 3) . Given these findings, the WHO provided the standards for weight-for-age, height-for-age, BMIfor-age, and weight-for-height (27) , but recommended the use of BMI-for-age as the preferred indicator for assessment of wasting and overnutrition, especially in short-statured children. However, some of the WHO guidelines continue to indicate both the weight-for-height and BMI-for-age as indicators for assessing wasting and overweight (28) and others recommend weightfor-height as the indicator for assessment of undernutrition (29) . In India, the majority of nutritionists and pediatricians have switched over to the use of BMI-for-age for assessment of nutritional status. Among national surveys, some continue to use weight-for-height instead of BMI-for-age for assessment of wasting and overnutrition in children (9, 11, 30) , while others have shifted to use of BMI-for-age (12, 14) . This accounts for some of the differences in the reported wasting rates between surveys. There are rapid changes in the growth of children (especially breastfed children) in the critical first 2 years of life (Figures 1, 3) ; BMI-for-age captures these age-related changes and helps in early detection of deviation in growth from BMI trajectory associated with changes in infant and young child feeding practices. Weight-for-height, being age independent, does not provide these insights (Figure 3B) . In view of this, we have preferred to use BMI-for-age for assessment of nutritional status in children.",
