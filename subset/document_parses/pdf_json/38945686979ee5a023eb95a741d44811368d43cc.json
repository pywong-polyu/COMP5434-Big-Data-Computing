This umbrella review aimed to provide an overview of the efficacy and safety of NOM of uncomplicated AA in the published systematic reviews. Methods This umbrella review has been reported in line with the PRISMA guidelines and umbrella review approach. Systematic reviews with and without meta-analyses on the efficacy of NOM of AA were analyzed. The quality of the reviews was assessed with the AMSTAR 2 tool. The main outcomes measures were the treatment failure and complication rates of NOM and hospital stay as compared to appendectomy. Results Eighteen systematic reviews were included to this umbrella review. Eight reviews documented higher odds of failure with NOM, whereas two reviews revealed similar odds of failure. Six reviews reported lower odds of complications with NOM, six reported similar odds, and one reported lower odds of complications with surgery. Eight reviews reported similar hospital stay between NOM and appendectomy, one reported longer stay with NOM and another reported shorter stay with NOM. Pooled analyses showed that NOM was associated with higher treatment failure overall, in children-only, adults only, and RCTs-only meta-analyses. NOM was associated with lower complications overall, yet children-only and RCTs-only analyses revealed similar complications to surgery. NOM was associated with shorter stay in the overall and adult-only analysis, but not in the children-only analysis. Conclusions NOM of AA is associated with higher treatment failure, marginally lower rate of complications and shorter stay than appendectomy.",

Only two reviews were of high quality and two were credible and entailed highly suggestive evidence. This calls for higher quality future trials on the role of NOM of AA to avoid the shortcomings of the present trials. NOM of AA is suggested as an alternative to appendectomy that can be similarly effective in controlling the symptoms, yet associated with less complications [37] . Therefore, the main outcomes of this umbrella review were treatment effectiveness and complications of NOM. The median rate of treatment failure of NOM was 25% and can reach up to 37.4% [19] . Almost all meta-analyses documented a higher likelihood of failure with NOM, as compared to appendectomy. The exception was a network meta-analysis [21] that reported similar odds of failure between NOM and surgery and this difference may be explained by the small number of studies included in the direct meta-analysis of failure of NOM (n = 3).",

Recently, another setting where NOM of AA may be a feasible treatment option has emerged, the COVID-19 pandemic.

One novel finding of this umbrella review is that while the risk ratio of complications in the overall analysis of all meta-analyses was lower with NOM, the subgroup analyses of children-only, adults-only, and RCTs-only meta-analyses found similar risk of complications. This interesting finding may be explained that the lower complication risk in the overall analysis was only marginal and thus when specifically analyzed for each population this marginal effect disappeared and the risk was similar between NOM and surgery.

Complications of surgery usually involve mild morbidities such as wound-related complications (infection, seroma, dehiscence), ileus, and pelvic collection. On the other hand, complications of NOM may involve formation of appendicular mass or abscess or sometimes perforation and peritonitis which is more serious and warrants interventional or surgical management. However, it should be noted that NOM for uncomplicated AA does not statistically increase the perforation rate in adult patients [37] . Another outcome of interest is hospital stay after NOM and surgery. It may be expected that NOM is associated with longer stay than appendectomy owing to the time required for the antibiotic treatment and for frequent observation of the patient to document improvement in symptoms with NOM. However, most meta-analyses documented similar stay with both treatment methods, except one [29] that concluded longer stay with NOM and another [32] that found longer stay with surgery. Interestingly, the summary effect estimate of hospital stay was significantly shorter with NOM overall, in adult-only population and in meta-analyses of RCTs alone, whereas meta-analyses entailing children only showed similar stay. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the difference in hospital stay between NOM and surgery groups was only a few hours which may not be clinically important.",

Therefore, the actual failure rate of NOM might be higher than that reported. Some systematic reviews included to this umbrella review may have included similar set of primary studies. However, each meta-analysis was handled and analyzed separately, knowing that some meta-analyses may have included similar set of primary studies, yet the study protocol, inclusion criteria, and statistical analysis methods of each meta-analysis would differ, and thus may lead to different conclusions. For example, using fixed-effect and random-effect models may yield different results. That is why the systematic reviews included had different weight and risk ratios as demonstrated in the forest plots, even if some included similar primary studies.",
