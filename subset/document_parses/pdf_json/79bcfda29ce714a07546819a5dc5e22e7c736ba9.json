Plotting mortality and diagnosis rates against medical staff resources in 16 cities in Hubei Province, where the epidemic was initially concerned and the most severe, shows a significant negative correlation, indicating the critical role of medical staff resources in controlling epidemics. Nevertheless, it is difficult to ensure that there exist enough medical personnel in cities severely hit by the outbreak. China provides solutions by adopting nationwide \"pairing assistance\" measures with at least one province assisting one city to alleviate pressure in the most severe area. By plotting the number of patients receiving treatment against day, it is clear that implementing \"pairing assistance\" is a turning point in China's fight against epidemics.",

The coronavirus crisis in China has abated after 2 months of hard work, while the rest of the world has sunk into an increasingly complex quagmire. Scholars own China's success in controlling COVID-19 to aggressive control measures, such as shutting down industrial and commercial restrictions, monitoring infected person and preventing cross-infection [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, the terrifying thing about a pandemic is that the influx of patients overloads the health services system, which leads to a serious shortage of health resources, especially for medical personnel.",

However, it is difficult for cities severely hit by the outbreak. China offers a solution by taking the nationwide \"pairing assistance\" measure, mobilizing 29 provinces to alleviate pressure on cities in Hubei province. For example, Wuhan, the provincial capital and the city hardest hit by the disease, had already received 32,572 medical personnel nationwide by Feb 20, 2020. Meanwhile, the other 16 cities with fewer technologies, personnel, and equipment than Wuhan were each partnered with at least one province that has sufficient capacity to assist them (Fig. 2) .",

Plotting the number of patients still undergoing treatment against the day clearly showed that the 22nd day after the lockdown of Wuhan was the turning point in fighting the epidemic (Fig. 3) although the total number of confirmed cases was still increasing rapidly at that time, illustrating the evident effect of \"pairing assistance\" on increasing the cure rate and relieving the pressure on health services system. It is worth noting that Shennongjia Forestry District has a high level of medical personnel resources (2.999 medical personnel per thousand population) and the smallest number of patients (only 11 confirmed cases), so it shows a different curve pattern.",
