Data provided in this study supports the utility of a newly-designed lateral flow immunoassay (LFA) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies. We employed a clinical cohort of 1,892 SARS-CoV-2 patients and controls, including individuals diagnosed by RT-qPCR at Yale New Haven Hospital, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical University, the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention of Hefei City (Hefei CDC), Anhui Province (Anhui Province CDC), and Fuyang City (Fuyang CDC). The LFA studied here detects SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies with a specificity of 97.9-100% for IgM, 99.7-100% for IgG, and sensitivities ranging from 94.1-100% for patients >14-days post symptom onset. Sensitivity decreases in patients <14-days post symptom onset, which is likely due to lower IgG/IgM antibody levels in this population. Finally, we developed a visual intensity reporting system that we believe will be suitable for laboratory and point-of-care settings, and will provide granular information about antibody levels. Overall our results support the widespread utility of this and other LFAs in assessing population-level epidemiological statistics.",

As of May 22 nd , 2020, more than 5 million cases have been reported globally, with more than one and a half million cases in the United States alone. Worldwide deaths from COVID-19 have reached 300,000 persons, although true prevalence and mortality is likely much higher, as limited diagnostic test implementation and the prevalence of asymptomatic carriers has masked the virus's full impact [2] . SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, is a respiratory pathogen that is readily transmitted from droplets and direct contact [1, 2] . The disease course of COVID-19 is highly variable. Many patients have relatively mild symptoms, while certain high-risk groups, such as the elderly and immunocompromised, can develop multi-organ system complications that often results in death. For example, the CDC reports age-related mortality rates ranging from 10-27% for persons aged >85 years, 3-11% for persons aged 65-84 years, and <1% among persons aged <54 years [3] .",

Despite these efforts, nearly 25,000 new infections occur each day in the United States as of May 22 nd , 2020. Furthermore, quarantine measures decrease quality of life and have negative economic impacts. Widespread access to diagnostic tests will be critical for restoring social normality and mitigating the harmful impact of the virus. In particular, diagnostic tests for immunological status, which measure IgG and IgM antibody responses, can provide essential information about an individual's past exposure to SARS-CoV-2 while also assessing the risk for subsequent infection. Most currently available antibody tests require complex laboratory settings; yet because 80% of all infected individuals may be asymptomatic, a reliable and easy-to-use diagnostic assay is desirable for deployment among the general population [2] .",

LFAs can be readily conducted by untrained individuals, only requiring simple fingerstick blood draws, to generate an easy-to-interpret readout ( Figure 1 ) in no more than 30 minutes. The LFA studied here provides two separate outputs -for both IgG and IgM -and therefore provides nuanced data related to current and past infections, while also helping to assess potential immunity [5, 7] . SARS-CoV-2 specific IgM antibodies predominate immediately after infection while IgG antibodies are produced in the later stages, approximately two weeks post initial infection [1, 2, 4] . Although it is currently unclear whether antibody responses alone provide immunity to SARS-CoV-2 reinfection [8, 9] , neutralizing antibodies have been observed in several cases, and antibody levels are also likely to serve as an index of other protective immune responses [7, 10] . After the United States Department of Health and Human Services began issuing emergency use authorizations (EUA) for immunoassay tests for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics, many manufacturers have submitted applications seeking approval. However, according to recent studies, comparative performance of these tests is variable [5] .",

This correlation supports that LFA band intensity is measuring antibody levels in serum.

The AIS correlates well with the VIS, and is particularly effective for darker intensity LFA bands ( Figure 7 ). The VIS tends to fail, however, in distinguishing low intensity positives from negatives, suggesting that visual inspection is superior to computer-assisted assay analysis. This finding may have implications for how best to implement LFA assays in point-of-care and home settings, and may also suggest a role for remote healthcare professionals test result analysis via telemedicine.",

While the AIS performed well for strongly positive results, it had difficulties distinguishing weakly positive and negative signals (Figure 7) .

In the case of the SARS-CoV-2 LFA test, false positive results are particularly concerning because they can be incorrectly interpreted to indicate that a user is protected from subsequent infection. Therefore, it is imperative that the specificity is particular to SARS-CoV-2 and not other forms of respiratory infections. Overall, our results indicated an extremely low false-positive rate and therefore an excellent level of test specificity. For example, the test performed with 100% specificity for both IgM and IgG in patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 illnesses, and in healthy patients attending physical examinations (Figure 4 ). For patients with non-SARS-CoV-2 respiratory infections the test performed with a 99.5% specificity for IgM and 100% specificity for IgG. For pregnant women, the tests performed with 97.9% specificity for IgM and 100% specificity for IgG ( Figure 4 ). Taken together, our data suggests that IgG is a more robust clinical endpoint for SARS-CoV-2 detection, whereas IgM from other infections or patient background may introduce specificity concerns.",

We hypothesize that this disparity results from the different \"gold standard\" assays employed in the two studies. All samples from the Yale site were pre-selected for ELISA+ RT-qPCR positivity while the Chinese sites used RT-qPCR. Therefore, this sensitivity difference is likely due to patients at the Chinese sites who, despite being PCR-positive, express little or no antibody. Overall, we believe that LFA tests will be most useful for surveying antibody levels in patients who are at least 14 days after the onset of symptoms.",

Among the false positive results that were observed, most were found in the IgM channel (12/1438), while only one (1/1438) was found in the IgG channel. This trend may be due to avidity effects arising from the pentavalent nature of IgM. Avidity effects amplify low affinity interactions through multivalency; IgM antibodies that recognize non-SARS-CoV-2 pathogens, but which still share weak structural homology to SARS-CoV-2 antigens present in the test, may still present as test positives. We therefore suggest that patients not rely solely on IgM positivity as a readout of antibody response.",

The Biohit LFA test evaluated in this study exhibited higher sensitivity values for IgG/IgM in patients with infection times >11 days compared with very best LFA and ELISA tests evaluated in the UCSF study (94.1%-100% versus 90.9-100%). Furthermore, the specificity of the Biohit test was comparable to the best performing assays evaluated by the UCSF group (97.6-100% versus 99.1-100%). Therefore, our data support that the Biohit test is an excellent candidate for widespread implementation. That being said, our studies do not represent a head-to-head comparison with assays evaluated by UCSF (i.e., we did not perform studies using the same patient samples), so any comparison must be interpreted with caution.",

Such false positives are perhaps most problematic from a public health standpoint because they would lead individuals to believe that they are immune or exposed to the virus when in fact they are not. While this LFA cannot predict protective immunity, it can identify people who can be serially assessed for resistance to possible subsequent infection on a population basis.
