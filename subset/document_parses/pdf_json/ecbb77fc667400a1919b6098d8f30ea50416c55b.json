            "text": "The proportion of the U.S. high school students who report using e-cigarettes (aka vaping devices) declined in 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, 19.6% of high school students (3.02 million) reported current e-cigarette use, compared to 27.5% (4.11 million) of high students who reported using e-cigarettes in 2019 (Wang, Neff, et al. 2020) . However, despite this recent decline, during 2019 -2020, the use of youth-appealing, low-priced disposable e-cigarette devices increased approximately 1,000% (from 2.4% to 26.5%) among high school current e-cigarette users (ibid.). In addition, more than eight in 10 teenage e-cigarette users reported consuming flavored e-cigarettes (ibid.). E-cigarettes can harm the adolescent brain and increase susceptibility to tobacco addiction (Health et al. 2016; Fraga 2019; Wang, Gentzke, et al. 2019) . As a result, youth who use e-cigarettes are more likely to subsequently try combustible cigarettes (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2018). Beyond addiction, e-cigarettes pose a risk of breathing difficulties, inflammatory reactions, lowered defense against pathogens and lung diseases (Redfield 2019 ; The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2019). Exposure to visual posts featuring e-cigarette products on social media, including promotional images and videos, has been associated with increased e-cigarette use among U.S. adolescents (Wang, Gentzke, et al. 2019; King et al. 2016; Maloney et al. 2016; Pokhrel et al. 2018; Kim et al. 2019) . Instagram, one of the most popular social media platforms among adolescents, is considered the largest source of e-cigarette social media advertisements (cite). E-cigarette stores, distributors and social media influencers -users with large followings who post vaping content on behalf of e-cigarette brands -promote ENDS (Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems) products on Instagram and other social media ).",

            "text": "In August 2018, the U.S. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) introduced a requirement that ecigarette advertisements, including social media imagery, contain a prominent warning label that reminds consumers that nicotine is addictive. The FDA requires that the warning statement appears on the upper portion of the advertisement, occupies at least 20 percent of the advertisement area, and be printed in in conspicuous and legible at least 12-point sans serif (e.g. Helvetica or Arial bold) font size (The U.S. Food and Drug Administration 2020). Several studies Laestadius et al. 2020 ) evaluated compliance with the 2018 FDA requirements for warning labels on Instagram. Vassey et al. (2020) manually reviewed 2,000 images posted in 2019 and found that only 7% included FDA-mandated warning statements. Posts uploaded from locations within the U.S. had the highest prevalence of warning labels, while posts uploaded from other countries were less likely to include warnings. Most of the international posts featured vaping products distributed in the U.S. and would therefore still be subject to compliance with the FDA warning-label regulations . Laestadius et al. (2020) manually reviewed 1,000 posts collected in late 2018-early 2020 and found that only 13% included warning statements.",

This study addresses the limitation of prior research by developing an automated deep learning image classification capable of quickly and accurately measuring compliance with the FDA requirements for warning labels on a large sample size. i.e. thousands of images. We tested whether advanced deep learning techniques could provide an effective, automated method to track vaping-related posts on Instagram and evaluate compliance with FDA warning label requirements.",

Starting with social influence, which is broader and typically disregards domain, multimodal learning has been deployed in the recent few years for predicting image popularity. Before the rise of deep learning, support vector machines were primarily used, leveraging basic image features such as color and saturation (Khosla et al. 2014) . In recent years, the focus has turned to the use of deep learning to synthesize information and learn feature representations directly from the data. Hu et al. utilize both tags and images (J. Hu et al. 2016) , leveraging the Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100M dataset. Zohourian and colleagues predicted the number of likes via context information (Zohourian et al. 2018 ). De et al. use standard deep neural networks (DNN) to predict future popularity of the Instagram of a lifestyle magazine (De et al. 2017) . Each of these cases demonstrate the inclusion of different features in regards to metadata, context, time, and social indicators.",
