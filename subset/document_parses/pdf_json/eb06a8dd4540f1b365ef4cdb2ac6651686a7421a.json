These vulnerabilities are the result of the interaction between individual and structural factors that shape how risk is experienced by disabled people. In Australia, these vulnerabilities are influenced by the way disability services and care for disabled people are delivered through a consumer-directed approach. We analysed the policies and documentation made by the Australian Government and state and territory governments during the pandemic to explore whether these were disability-inclusive. We aimed to unpack how these policies shaped disabled people as vulnerable citizens. Methods: Guided by documentary research, we used framework analysis to examine the policies of the Australian Government and state and territory governments. We analysed legislation that was given royal assent by the federal, state and territory governments, and documents (reports, fact sheets, guidance documents, etc.) published by the federal government and the state of Victoria (given that this state experienced the brunt of the epidemic in Australia) between February 2020 to August of 2020.",

In addition, most policies formulated by the Australian Government were related to the expansion of welfare services and the creation of economic stimulus schemes. However, while the stimulus included unemployed people, the expansion of benefits explicitly excluded disabled people who were not employed. Most of the legislation and documents offered accessibility options, though most of these options were only available in English. Disability oriented agencies offered more extensive accessibility options.",

However, disability-inclusiveness appeared to be inconsistent and not fully considered, leaving disabled people exposed to greater risk of COVID-19. Neoliberal policies in the health and welfare sector in Australia have led to an individualisation of the responsibility to remain healthy and a reliance on people as independent consumers. Governments need to take a clear stance towards the emergence of such a discourse that actively disvalues disabled people.",

Disabled people are seen as vulnerable to COVID-19 infection due to their bodily conditions, a perception which places responsibility for the prevention from infection onto the individual [3] . Research and advocacy have highlighted that, far from being an 'inherent' artefact of disability, this vulnerability is an artefact of interactions between structural factors and the individual. The many ways in which vulnerability is created for people with disability was documented in the October 2020 interim report of the Australian Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability [4] . This major public inquiry highlighted that vulnerability is not a product of disability in and of itself, but results from contemporary and historical Australian Government policies, produced at Federal and State (or Territory) levels.",

Epstein et al. [2] found that people with disability experienced barriers in accessing their usual health and social care, as well as for COVID-19related care (including testing, also see [9] [10] [11] ). Ableist medical rationing was a significant concern [2] ; not only did disabled people feel discriminated when they sought care, but they were fearful of the effects of this should they require hospitalisation [2] . In this and other similar studies, people with disabilities also reported anxiety and fear around the requirement placed upon them to 'shield' from COVID-19 infection, as this was not always possible [1, 11, 12] . While these themes speak to health and care, people with disabilities reported significant disruptions in their everyday lives, from accessing groceries and medication to having opportunities for social connection with others [2, 11] . These effects are intensified by intersectional disadvantages [9, 13] .",

Examining disability inclusion and COVID-19 in four South American countries, Sakellariou et al. [14] found that recommendations were often made, without specific attention given to the translation of these into practice. Notably, they found that where government responses did not fully address disability inclusion, they compounded the disadvantage experienced by people living with disability. Uneven levels of inclusion of people with disability in pandemic-specific policies, detailed by Kavanagh et al. [8] , range from the failure to consider disabled people as an 'at risk' or 'vulnerable' population group in pandemic management plans [3, 8] to the release of disability-specific advice (including operational plans) for people in response to community-based advocacy. In Australia, where over 4 million people, or 18 % of the population, live with disability, including 51 % of the population aged over 65 [15] , both the Federal and the state governments designed and implemented policies to control the pandemic.",

Our analysis is informed by the 'Health in All Policies' (HiAP) approach, which calls for a collaborative and multisector public policy orientation within government to simultaneously consider the health implications of their initiatives, decisions and settings, with the goal of improving health for the whole population [16, 17] . As implemented in South Australia, a HiAP focus considers health as constituted by \"social, economic, political, cultural and environmental determinants\" [17] . Thus, it looks beyond the individual bodies to attend to questions of equityand the barriers to health equityand enhanced accountability [18] [19] [20] . Below, we consider the implications for disabled people within the pandemic response, and consider how a HiAP approach might reshape their inclusion.",

Rapid increases in infection rates were subsequently reported, from 98 cases identified Australia-wide on February 28, to a cumulative total of 6058 cases by March 31, 2020 [22] . To control the spread of infection, a collaborative emergency response was formulated across all levels of government, including the establishment of the National Cabinet, an intergovernmental forum [23] to develop a cohesive national strategy for managing COVID-19 infection. Subsequently, countrywide lockdown restrictions (announced on March 21, 2020) and border closures were implemented. 1 The strategies that were implemented to contain COVID-19 risk had specific implications for disabled people, many of which had not been considered in the rapid and decisive response to contain the pandemic. A 'Statement of Concern,' issued by the Royal Commission into Violence, Abuse, Neglect and Exploitation of People with Disability [25] 2 on March 26, 2020, outlined to the government and community their responsibilities to disabled people under the Convention for the Rights of People with Disabilities (CRPD). Some of those responsibilities were discharged by the National Disability Insurance Scheme (NDIS), a consumer-directed funding model for health and social supports, and the disabled people and workers engaged through the NDIS [25] .",

However, it provided evidence of ableist welfare policies during the COVID-19 pandemic (as we discuss in our findings below), so that people on the DSP were excluded from accessing the same financial support as those receiving other forms of social welfare.

Victoria underwent a strict lockdown that began with restrictions imposed on July 8th 2020, followed by a declaration of a state of disaster on the 2nd of August which imposed limits on the reasons to leave one's home, traveling only within 5 km of one's home, a curfew from 8 pm to 5 am, and the suspension of in-person services, including schools, to mitigate the spread of the pandemic. The measures began to slowly ease on September 13 and by September 27 the lockdown began to be loosened given the falling number of daily cases. The results of the mitigation measures resulted in a successful suppression of the pandemic with regards to community transmission given that as of November 27, 2020, Victoria had recorded no new cases for 28 consecutive days [30, 31] .",

Table 2 presents the adapted thematic framework we developed from the synthesis of the different recommendations. -Indexing: We used the thematic framework across the two data categories, legislation and other documents. At this stage, we examined the data for information that was relevant to the thematic framework, and we made necessary adjustments to the framework, to ensure it was relevant and reflected the data. First, we broadened the focus of the analysis to include other meaningful data (what we classified as \"other documents\"). This other data was communicating government policy that would have otherwise been captured by looking solely at legislation -mainly because of the decision making residing in cabinet members with powers granted by declared state of emergencies. Second, as shown in Table 2 , the themes were adapted to account for the sociocultural and political context of Australia and subsequently one of the themes (inclusion to decision making process), was excluded from the detailed thematic analysis. This was done because we concluded that it was more appropriate to discuss the participation of disabled people and their representative organisations in regard to the analysed data as part of the overall findings of this paper. We evaluated the data by comparing each document to the themes of the framework. This approach consisted of evaluating the definitions of each theme and assess if the document had elements that would warrant it to be classified as belonging to and/or answering the characteristics of that theme. Classification of the data to each theme relied on the content and method of access, not on the intended audience or aim of the legislation and other documents. The thematic analysis was reliant on the presence of the themes in the data. -Charting: This phase focused on data extraction. We kept a spreadsheet that included the name of each Measures and recommendations taken to protect disabled people who are in increased risk of social exclusion and poverty, such as women, children, homeless people, prisoners, migrants/ refugees, and members of Culturally and Linguistically Diverse (CALD) communities. This also includes any consideration aimed at Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.",

People are being blamed, and sometimes penalised, for poor health outcomes with little or no consideration of structural factors. This personalisation rhetoric [42] transforms disabled people into liabilities who use up limited resources, and they are directly or indirectly excluded from the healthcare system, as examples from countries that have a long history in implementing neoliberal policies demonstrate [44] . Yet, there are strategies available to promote greater inclusionand thus health equityfor all structurally vulnerable peoples. The move to a Health in All Policies (HiAP) approach is one such strategy [16] , yet has only been implemented in one Australian state (South Australia, 17) . However, the influence of this initiative was unclear in our analysis.",

The failure of states across the world to provide care to those most at need, is exemplified through shifting the responsibility to individual actors (and also the blame for noncompliance), with little acknowledgment of structural factors that intersect with infection and contagion. Little, if any, consideration is given to the fact that, as Kochhar argues, while disabled people are asked to shield and protect themselves, \"most of this discourse is ablebodiedit concerns bodies capable of these \"essential measures\" in the first place\" [46] . As Andrews et al. warn, disablism and its associated \"message that some lives are more worthy than others\" is already being translated into policy [47] . This is more explicitly exemplified in medical rationing practices and their justification [45] which are often based on a neo-eugenics discourse, decreeing some bodies as expendable.",
