Cytokine storm refers to a set of clinical conditions caused by excessive immune reactions and has been recognized as a leading cause of severe COVID-19. While comparisons have been made between COVID-19 cytokine storm and other kinds of cytokine storm such as hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis and cytokine release syndrome, the pathogenesis of cytokine storm has not been clearly elucidated yet. Recent studies have shown that impaired response of type-1 IFNs in early stage of COVID-19 infection played a major role in the development of cytokine storm, and various cytokines such as IL-6 and IL-1 were involved in severe COVID-19. Furthermore, many clinical evidences have indicated the importance of anti-inflammatory therapy in severe COVID-19. Several approaches are currently being used to treat the observed cytokine storm associated with COVID-19, and expectations are especially high for new cytokine-targeted therapies, such as tocilizumab, anakinra, and baricitinib. Although a number of studies have been conducted on anti-inflammatory treatments for severe COVID-19, no specific recommendations have been made on which drugs should be used for which patients and when. In this review, we provide an overview of cytokine storm in COVID-19 and treatments currently being used to address it. In addition, we discuss the potential therapeutic role of extracorporeal cytokine removal to treat the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19.",

Researchers have since revealed that cytokine storm occurs in various diseases, such as malignancy, rheumatologic disease, and sepsis syndrome and is a concern in COVID-19 [5] . Even though a variety of Ivyspring International Publisher treatments to mitigate cytokine storm have been introduced, no concrete treatment recommendations have been issued so far for COVID-19: in recent studies novel cytokine blockades targeting specific cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1 and IL-6 or Janus kinase (JAK) pathway have shown promising potential for the treatment of COVID-19. In addition, traditional anti-inflammatory drugs, including corticosteroids and colchicine, are also being explored for COVID-19 through active and vibrant researches [6] .",

Laboratory tests revealed anemia, neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and marked lymphopenia. These clinical features of multi-organ failure are believed to be caused by activation of the following four cascades: complement, kinin, clotting, and fibrinolysis systems [9] .

Primary or familial HLH by genetic mutations and secondary HLH by specific viral infections, malignancies, autoimmune disorders, and iatrogenic causes are typical diseases accompanied by cytokine storm [11] . In particular, cytokine storm caused by autoimmune disorders is historically called macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) [12] , and cytokine release syndrome (CRS) refers to the cytokine storm that occurs after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy [13] . Sepsis is also an important cause for the development of cytokine storm, but it is not easy to discriminate cytokine storm from the clinical course of severe sepsis itself [14] .",

IFN-\u03b3 is a key cytokine in primary HLH [15] . IL-1\u00df plays a major role in systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (SJIA) [16] , while in MAS associated with SJIA, IL-18 may be a key cytokine [17] . Another representative cytokine, IL-6, is a key inflammatory molecule in CRS [18] . Importantly, even if the clinical symptoms caused by a cytokine storm exhibit a common pattern, treatment must be individualized because the degree to which each cytokine contributes to the development of the disease can differ [3] . On the other hand, cytokine storm in sepsis involves multiple factors, and thus, multi-directional suppression of inflammatory reactions is necessary.",

One study has described a possible mechanism for lymphopenia in cytokine storm. After the TGN1412 trial, Muller et al. administered another anti-CD28 super-agonistic antibody, JJ316, to experimental rats and observed responses [19] . Similar to those that occurred in the TGN1412 trial, including lymphopenia. Further investigations revealed that T cells were rapidly redistributed to secondary lymphoid organs, such as the spleen and lymph nodes, and were trapped with decreased mobility. Although we are not sure why these findings occur as a part of systemic hyper-inflammatory reactions, considering that lymphopenia was seen without infection in the trial, it is not likely that lymphopenia is induced directly by a pathogenic organism, such as a virus. Instead, we believe that lymphopenia might be the result of effective immune reactions against severe systemic infections for more efficient trafficking of immune cells to secondary lymphoid organs. One other notable thing from the TGN1412 trial is that the violent inflammatory responses were followed by reactive immunosuppression. The responses, called \"second wave\" or \"immune paralysis,\" were found to downregulate the previous inflammatory reactions, which is likely why TGN1412 was suspected as showing therapeutic effects on autoimmune disease in preclinical studies in rats [20] .",

            "text": "Research has yet to reveal whether cytokine storm results from abnormal innate or adaptive immunity. As observed in the TGN1412 trial, rapid onset of cytokine storm after drug administration and a series of inflammatory responses following an acute increase of TNF-\u03b1 suggests a problem with innate immunity [8] . However, considering the elevation of soluble interleukin-2 receptor in secondary HLH [21] and the effects of standard treatment for HLH targeting dysregulated T cells [22] , the problem of adaptive immunity is also thought to be the main mechanism of cytokine storm. Among various cytokines related to cytokine storm, IL-1 and IL-6 have been described as key cytokines in some patients. These cytokines are representative pro-inflammatory cytokines, along with TNF-\u03b1, that play an important role in acute phase responses of inflammation. Pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), such as toll-like receptor (TLR) and retinoic acid-inducible gene-1-like receptor (RLR), are proteins that present in the cytoplasm or cell membrane to recognize infection or tissue damage by combining with pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) derived from microorganisms or damage-associated molecular pattern (DAMP) resulting from tissue damage. IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 are produced by dendritic cell and mononuclear macrophage that are activated by PRRs, and initiate a series of acute inflammatory reactions through activation of innate immunity [23] . Meanwhile, however, IL-6, along with IFN-\u03b3, is also important for T-cell mediated adaptive immunity [24] . Therefore, dysregulated activation of T cells can be considered as a major pathological mechanism in a cytokine storm wherein IL-6 and IFN-\u03b3 are key cytokines. Taken together, although the clinical characteristics of cytokine storm are similar, underlying pathological mechanisms affecting the clinical course, prognosis, and treatment response in individual forms of cytokine storm can differ. Thus, it is important to find the key cytokine in various cytokine storms and to take a proper therapeutic approach by determining whether the instance is related with innate or adaptive immunity.",

            "text": "A recent article presented an interesting concept of a cytokine storm in COVID-19. The study argued that the cytokine storm in COVID-19 is the result from a failure of the immune system to remove the virus. They divided the cytokine storm into two stages [27] : The first stage is a temporary immune-deficient condition that is similar to primary HLH. The subsequent secondary stage is an overactive immune state to compensate for the target clearance failure, which appears as a clinical manifestation of a cytokine storm. Another review article also described the cytokine storm associated with COVID-19 in a similar context [28] . Cell and animal experiments investigating the effects of human coronavirus on cytokines have demonstrated delayed secretion of type \u2160 and \u2162 IFNs, including IFN \u03b1/ \u00df, in the early phase of infection and excessive secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines from mononuclear macrophages in the later stage [29] . Another study in which immune analysis was performed in COVID-19 patients highlighted profound impaired type 1 IFN responses characterized by a low level of IFN activity and downregulation of IFN stimulated genes. In addition, the study reported hyper-inflammatory responses represented by IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 [30] . Taken together, these studies emphasize that a failure in initial type-\u2160 and \u2162 IFN responses to SARS-CoV-2 leads to an excessive late immune response and severe form of COVID-19 (Figure 1 ). In this respect we could figure out why severe COVID-19 is commonly accompanied by ARDS. The failure of immune response in initial period of SARS-CoV-2 infection induces generalized hyper-inflammation in lung that leads to acute lung injury and ARDS.",

Thus, IFN-\u03b3 is considered a major effector cytokine in various cytokine storm disorders. In particular, IFN-\u03b3 is a key cytokine in primary HLH, which is caused by hyperactivity of the immune system in response to a failure to eliminate pathogens due to perforin defects. In HLH, IFN-\u03b3 is excessively stimulated and leads to a cytokine storm. Emapalumab, an anti-IFN-\u03b3 monoclonal antibody, has been used to treat primary HLH since it was approved by the FDA in 2018 [57] . Several studies have documented clinical effects for emapalumab by confirming decreases in blood levels of C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 9 (CXCL9), an IFN-\u03b3 derived chemokine that is a good indicator to measure IFN-\u03b3 activity after use of emapalumab. A recent interventional study indicated that emapalumab had clinical effects without specific side effects in primary HLH treatment [58] . Another study described clinical effects for emapalumab in refractory HLH caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection [59] . Interestingly, the study indicated that excess IFN-\u03b3 contributed to immune paralysis and that emapalumab could reduce cytokine storm and effectively clear persistent EBV by reversing immune paralysis. For treating COVID-19, there are no significant trials supporting the use of IFN-\u03b3 inhibitors yet. Instead, many researchers have attempted to administer type 1 IFNs, such as IFN \u03b1, \u00df and \u03ba, in the early phase of COVID-19 [60, 61] , as recent studies have suggested that decreased type \u2160 and \u2162",

            "text": "JAK is an intracellular tyrosine kinase that mediates signals from cytokines, hormones, and growth factors. The Janus kinase-signal transducer and activator of transcription (JAK/STAT) pathway is commonly involved in various cytokine activation processes (Figure 1) . JAK inhibitors, including ruxolitinib and baricitinib, have been used to treat a variety of autoimmune and hematology diseases. JAK inhibition is thought to be able to effectively suppress cytokine storm because it can non-selectively inhibit the activity of many cytokines. On the other hand, non-selective inhibition of the immune response poses a risk of secondary infection, because it also suppresses the innate immune system that fights against pathogenic microorganisms, such as viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Moreover, because the JAK/STAT pathway is involved in several physiological mechanisms other than the immune response, inhibition of these pathways can potentially lead to unexpected side effects. JAK inhibition in COVID-19 appears to offer two clinical advantages. JAK inhibitors block cytokine signaling, thereby reducing excessive inflammatory responses, as well as the entry of SARS-CoV-2, in the early phase of infection [63] . As is well known, SARS-CoV-2 enters the body through angiotensin converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) on alveolar type 2 cells in the lungs, and several regulators are involved in mediating endocytosis and intracellular transport through ACE2. AP2-associated protein kinase-1, one such regulator, is also a target of JAK inhibitors, particularly baricitinib. Thus, JAK inhibitors can impede the entry and proliferation of SARS-CoV-2 [64] . Accordingly, several JAK inhibitors, including baricitinib, ruxolitinib, and fedratinib, are being studied in the treatment of severe COVID-19. A recent multi-centered RCT of ruxolitinib in patients with COVID-19 noted faster clinical improvement with the drug, although the results lacked statistical significance [65] . Another multi-centered retrospective study demonstrated that baricitinib reduced the rate of ICU admission and fatality and increased discharge rates [66] .",

This trends show that anti-inflammatory treatment is as important as anti-viral treatment in the treatment of COVID-19. As with any serious illness, many clinicians are currently using glucocorticoids as an empirical treatment for severe COVID-19. Unlike specific cytokine inhibitors, glucocorticoids are believed to be effective against cytokine storm by inhibiting multiple inflammatory targets (Figure 1) . Glucocorticoids not only have excellent immunosuppressive effects on immune cells, but also have anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting the production of major inflammatory molecules, including prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Evidence supporting the use of glucocorticoids in severe COVID-19, however, is lacking [67, 68] . Although this matter is still argued, several studies have positively reported steroid effects in severe COVID-19 [69, 70] .",

Treatment of the cytokine storm belongs to the latter, and new targeted therapies for cytokines and corticosteroids have been attempted. Anti-inflammatory therapy in severe COVID-19 poses one critical issue. Anti-inflammatory treatment is aimed at clinical improvement through suppression of excessive immune responses; while on the other hand, the immunosuppressive effect of antiinflammatory treatment paradoxically decreases the clearance of the virus from the body and increases the risk of secondary bacterial infections. In influenza infections, despite no definitive conclusion on their effects and risks, steroids are considered empirical drugs in severe cases. During influenza pandemic periods, many clinicians use steroids to treat serious clinical complications, including ARDS [82] . To compensate for decreased capacity of viral eradication and to avoid the risk of secondary bacterial infections, simultaneous administration of anti-viral agents (e.g., oseltamivir) and broad-spectrum antibiotics are essential in severe influenza infection [83] . On the contrary, the anti-inflammatory treatment for severe COVID-19 is in a very disadvantageous position, because there is no proven effective anti-viral agent at the moment. Although an observational study and a preliminary report from an RCT on the effectiveness of the use of remdesivir in severe COVID-19 have recently been released, further verification through complete and reliable RCTs is required [84, 85] . In COVID-19, immunosuppressive agents, including cytokine blockades and steroids, should be used appropriately only when an excessive immune response is evident, and thus, a proper clinical diagnosis of cytokine storm is essential.",

Nevertheless, there is no clear evidence to recommend the use of TPE in severe sepsis yet, because the available trials have shown conflicting results [95, 96] . Still, a few studies support the role of TPE in sepsis. A well-conducted systemic review indicated that TPE could reduce mortality in adult patients with sepsis [97] . A recent non-randomized prospective study demonstrated that early TPE was associated with a rapid reduction of norepinephrine in septic shock, maintaining mean arterial pressure above 65 mmHg. Furthermore, it could also reduce pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u00df, and angiopoietin-2) [98] . Another investigation involving subjects with septic shock demonstrated that TPE partially reversed coagulation disorders in patients requiring high doses of norepinephrine [99] .",

            "text": "In regard to TPE use in cytokine storm, TPE has several strengths. First, TPE can elicit immediately clinical effects in rapidly deteriorating cytokine storm. Early use of TPE may compensate for relatively slow action of immunosuppressants. Second, TPE exhibits non-selective properties in the elimination of inflammatory cytokines. It is believed that nonselective removal of cytokines is particularly suitable for the treatment of sepsis-induced cytokine syndrome [100] , because the occurrence of a cytokine storm related to sepsis is believed to be the result of a complex mechanism involving various inflammatory factors [101] . In that context, we prefer centrifugaltype TPE over filtration-type, because centrifugal TPE is less selective in separating plasma, although we still believe that TPE itself could provide clinical benefits regardless of the type. A previous study in the patients with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome also demonstrated that centrifugal TPE had shorter time to onset and greater clinical effects than double filtration plasmapheresis [102] . Last, bulk removal of cytokines by TPE could obviate negative effects on immune cells and improve the function of monocytes and/or macrophages, thereby reversing immune paralysis. Overall, the immunomodulation effects by TPE could reinforce the immunity against COVID-19 and provide the chance of overcoming cytokine storm by increasing susceptibility to simultaneously administered immunosuppressants [100] .",

            "text": "Influenza infection as a viral disease is more similar to COVID-19 than bacterial sepsis. Severe COVID-19 has clinical features similar to severe influenza infection, characterized by acute lung injury and multiple organ failure. A few case studies have reported that TPE could be helpful in serious influenza infections. One case study showed that three children with severe influenza infections were able to recover from acute respiratory failure and hemodynamic shock through a rescue therapy comprising three consecutive sessions of TPE [103] . Another case study showed that three patients with influenza-associated encephalopathy had markedly improved with two to three sessions of TPE every other day in combination with methylprednisolone injections (30 mg/kg). In addition, the study indicated that a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, IL-6, was significantly reduced in blood and cerebrospinal fluid after repetitive TPE [104] . Currently, remdesivir is being considered as a potential drug for treating COVID-19; however, in severe COVID-19, both antiviral treatment that suppresses the activity of the virus and anti-inflammatory treatment that can reduce excessive inflammation in the body are essential. In our eyes, rescue therapy comprising TPE as an alternative treatment early in serious cases with signs of a rapid worsening disease course and features of cytokine storm might be warranted. Despite the lack of a solid basis for the availability of TPE, even in severe infectious conditions such as sepsis, we believe that practical experiences with TPE use in various clinical diseases provide clues on TPE availability. Furthermore, the simple and reasonable hypothesis that, by exchanging plasma, cytokines and viruses can be effectively eliminated is worth considering. In this regard, a recent case report described the effects of TPE on COVID-19 [105] . In that case report, a patient with severe respiratory failure and anti-phospholipid syndrome by COVID-19 was given three sessions of plasma exchange. After plasma exchange, the patient showed clinical improvements with reduced titers of antiphospholipid antibodies and inflammatory markers, including IL-6. Another case series demonstrated that TPE had effects on treating COVID-19-related autoimmune meningoencephalitis [106] . In that report, ferritin levels reflective of hyper-inflammatory states were reduced significantly after repetitive plasma exchange. Other than that, a few case studies of COVID-19 patients with ARDS and shock have indicated that TPE dramatically improved clinical conditions and inflammatory markers, even after small numbers of trials [107] [108] [109] [110] . A recent observational cohort study also showed that TPE afforded clinical benefits of a higher extubation rate and lower mortality rate at 28-day in COVID-19 patients with respiratory failure than non-TPE cases [111] . Currently, while there are increasing case reports indicating the usefulness of TPE use in severe COVID-19 ( Table 3 ) and while many clinicians might be using it in clinical practice, RCTs are still required to attain relevant clinical evidence in support thereof [112] .",

In addition, it can cause electrolyte imbalances, such as hypocalcemia and hypokalemia, depending on the type of anti-coagulating agents or replacement fluids. TPE can also occasionally induce unpredicted anaphylactic shock due to the use of blood materials. However, the incidences of these complications are thought to be relatively small, and most cases can be controlled with medical support. Although TPE can be applied without technical difficulties in experienced centers, active involvement of medical staff in this procedure and capacity issues (most centers are limited with machines) only allow for the use of TPE in selected patients. Above all, the primary critical issue with TPE in COVID-19 is that the use of non-convalescent plasma as a substitution fluid could reduce protective antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. According to the clinical experiences of a few researchers, SARS-CoV-2-specific IgG and IgA antibodies were detected in waste bags, and circulating antibodies were also reduced during TPE application [113] . However, despite these concerns, a few studies have demonstrated the clinical benefits of TPE in severe COVID-19, and we believe that timely, appropriate application of TPE in selected cases presenting with cytokine storm could be beneficial.",

Therefore, it is better to start TPE early when blood pressure is maintained. In addition, referring to existing reports, we believe that TPE may be appropriate for use every day, or every other day. Previous reports have generally applied TPE two to three times in total; however, we believe that TPE can continue as long as there is no particular complication and exchangeable plasma is supplied smoothly. In addition, discontinuation may be considered if critical clinical conditions can be controlled by therapeutic methods other than TPE. In a few studies, two to 14 daily sessions, on average, were performed, with close monitoring of disseminated intravascular coagulation markers [116, 117] . A target calculated plasma volume exceeding 1 should be considered, and fresh frozen plasma is recommended to be used as a substitution fluid, due to the replenishment of anti-infective factors in serum. Ideally, convalescent plasma, if available, should be used, even if only at the end of a session [118] [119] [120] . Regarding existing TPE techniques, the centrifugal method might be preferable, as RCTs on TPE in septic shock have showed positive results with using centrifugation, although filtration types are also considered useful. Also, precise fluid overload control is necessary as decreasing vessel permeability is positive but can further impair pulmonary saturation.",

Dendritic cells and mononuclear macrophages that recognize viral antigens induce an acute phase response through pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-1, and TNF-\u03b1. Among them, IL-6 stimulates T-cells to activate adaptive immunity. Activated T cells also stimulate macrophage and NK cells through IFN-\u03b3 to promote virus removal. Failure of the initial immune response by type-1 IFNs increases excessively the activity of immune system leading to cytokine storm. Aerosolized type-1 IFNs promotes an initial immune response to remove virus, corticosteroids and novel cytokine blockades inhibits immune responses to prevent cytokine storm.
