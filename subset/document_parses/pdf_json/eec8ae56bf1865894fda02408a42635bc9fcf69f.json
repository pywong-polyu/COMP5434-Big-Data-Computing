Flavonoids and triterpenoids from M. dioica were more extensively investigated for antiviral, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory activities. In this present study, we have predicted the reported bioactive flavonoids and triterpenoids of the plant against the SARS-CoV-2 main protease, RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), spike protein, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE-2) receptor and dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP4) receptor through molecular docking and in silico ADME predictions methods. According to the binding affinities, the two triterpenoids, hederagenin and oleanolic acid exhibited the best docking scores with these proteins than the catechin and quercetin with compared to standard remdesivir, favipiravir and hydroxychloroquine. The in vitro protein-drug studies have also showed significant interaction of catechin and quercetin compounds than standard drugs. The in silico binding studies correlated with the in silico binding studies. Further, M. dioica being used as antidiabetic and its metabolite had significant interaction with DDP4, a comorbidity protein involved in aiding the viral entry. Out of all the natural ligands, quercetin was reported relatively good and safe for humans with high gastrointestinal tract permeability and poor blood brain barrier crossing abilities. Hence, M. dioica phytocompounds reflects promising therapeutic properties against SARS-CoV-2 infections under comorbid conditions such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease and kidney disorders.",

It has many nutritional and disease combating properties still it is an underutilized plant which needs to be explored to justify its therapeutical roles. All the parts of plant have been reported for secondary metabolites that includes alkaloids, steroids, triterpenoids, saponins, phenolic compounds and flavonoids ( Figure 1 ). The roots have reported for anti -diabetic, anti-viral, immunostimulant, anti-inflammatory, anti-pyretic, antiseptic, anti-ulcerative, antitoxic, anti-perspirant, anti-hemorrhoidal, bowel infection reducer and skin softening properties. Stearic acid, steroids like a-spinasterol octadecenoate, a-spinasterol-3-O-b-D-glucopyranoside, oleanolic acid, gypsogenin, hederagenin and triterpenoids like 3b-O-benzoyl-6-oxo-ursolic acid, 3b-O-benzoyl-11-oxo-ursolic acid, 3-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl hederagenin, 3-O-b-D-glucopyranosyl gypsogenin, 3-O-b-D-glucuronopyranosyl gypsogenin were identified in the methanolic extract of roots of this plant (Talukdar & Hossain, 2014) . Based on literature survey, the flavonoids such as catechin & quercetin and phyto-steroids such as oleanolic acid and hederagenin have shown anti-viral and antidiabetic potentials that can serve as potential natural drug candidates against coronavirus (Hastantram et al., 2020; Thiruvengadam et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading across the world at an alarming rate and with lack of specific drugs and vaccines. The increasing mortality and morbidity rates necessitate the urge to discover and develop potential cure against the virus and the comorbid conditions. The best knowledge of medicinal plants has always been a savior that offer therapeutic effect with less side effects. Emerging data suggest that COVID-19 patients with other comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, cardiac and pulmonary diseases are more susceptible with increased mortality when compared to general populations . These subgroups of COVID-19 patients with associated comorbidities metabolites and compounds have reported to possess antiviral properties. Therefore, this study focuses on the evaluation of outcome in diabetic patients with SARS-CoV-2 flavonoids and triterpenoid such as quercetin, catechin, oleanolic acid and hederagenin from M. dioica to predict inhibitory potential of main protease (M pro )/chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) (Figure 2 People with diabetes are at higher risk to develop complications with a corona virus infections. The recent data from the 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) also confirms that diabetes, along with advanced age and/or presence of cardiovascular conditions, obesity, is a major risk factor for an adverse outcome. Similarly, Diabetes was also a major contributor to MERS-CoV disease severity and mortality (Iacobellis, 2020) . Patients who have diabetes are often have associated with the weakened immune response, both concerning cytokine profile as well as changes in immune responses together with T-cell and macrophage activation. Weaker glycemic control harms several aspects of the immune response by a viral infection and in addition to the risk of potential bacterial secondary infection in the lungs. According to studies, the coronavirus predominantly infects human by allowing the cells to enter through the ACE-2 receptor. Spike proteins of coronavirus usually bind to the ACE receptors in the lungs. ACE-2 is a peptidase enzyme and a membrane glycoprotein, mainly expressed in epithelial cells of the lungs, intestine, kidney and blood vessels to regulate the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). This enzyme is the main component that converts Ang-I to Ang-II (Das et al., 2020) and angiotensin-I (Ang-I) to peptides, angiotensin (1-7) and angiotensin (1-9), separately. Angiotensin (1-7) is responsible for the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant role (Das et al., 2020) . Human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) was identified as a functional receptor for the spike protein of the SARS CoV-2 viral entry. DPP4 enzyme is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, expressed ubiquitously in many tissues, including the immune cells. DPP4 degrades incretins such as glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, ultimately leading to reduced insulin secretion and abnormal visceral adipose tissue metabolism (Iacobellis, 2020) . The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) component ACE2 and DPP4 are proteins dysregulated in diabetes (Cuschieri & Grech, 2020; Valencia et al., 2020) . The entry of SARS-CoV-2 within the host cell triggers an inflammatory response, recruitment of T helper cells with the production of interferon gamma leading to a cytokine storm. Hence, considering the cellular mechanisms triggered by SARS-CoV-2 and the pathophysiology of diabetes, individuals with diabetes are more susceptible to a cytokine storm with potential organ damage if infected by COVID-19 (Iacobellis, 2020) . ACE-2 is also expressed in the pancreas. So, the entry of the coronavirus into the pancreatic islets may cause an acute beta-cell dysfunction with a resultant acute hyperglycemic state. Hence, individuals with diabetes are vulnerable to COVID-19 infection leading to an uncontrolled hyperglycemic status (Cuschieri & Grech, 2020; Valencia et al., 2020) . To summarize, potential mechanisms that may increase the susceptibility for COVID-19 in patients with DM includes higher affinity cellular binding and efficient virus entry, decreased viral clearance, diminished T cell function, increased susceptibility to hyperinflammation and cytokine storm syndrome, presence of cardiovascular diseases (Muniyappa & Gubbi, 2020) . Liu et al., have successfully crystallized the main protease (M pro )/chymotrypsin-like protease (3CL pro ) from COVID-19 has been structured and repositioned in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) Quimque et al., 2020) . This protease represents a potential target for the inhibition of corona virus for entry and replication. In this study, the binding affinity of mentioned ligands to main protease (6LU7), spike protein with ACE2 receptor (6M0J), RdRp (6M71) and MERS-CoV with hDPP4 receptor (4L72) proteases was examined and compared with ",

The active site of RdRp is highly conserved and contains aspartate residues that protrude from the beta-turn joining the b15 and b16 (Figure 2(b) ). With a vital role in viral genome replication, the active site residues of RdRp and most of the 5-\u00c5region surrounding it are surface accessible and can bind to free nucleotides, including ATP, GTP, CTP and UTP. Similar to the viral proteases, RdRp is regarded as a molecular target for the development of new drugs against SARS-CoV2 . The replication mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 is chiefly led by RdRp, a complex of nsp12, nsp8 and nsp7. The structure resembles a partially curled right-hand grip and can be assorted into three regions namely the palm, the thumb and the fingers (Quimque et al., 2020) .",

Remdesivir was originally investigated as a treatment for Ebola virus, but has potential to treat a variety of RNA viruses. Its activity against the coronavirus (CoV) family of viruses, such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, was described in 2017 and it is also being investigated as a potential treatment for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Remdesivir was granted an FDA Emergency Use Authorization on 1 st May 2020. Remdesivir is a nucleoside analog used to inhibit the action of RNA polymerase that terminate the RNA transcription (Figure 4(e)) (Sheahan et al., 2020). Hydroxychloroquine is a racemic mixture consisting of an R and S enantiomer (Figure 4 (f)). It is an aminoquinoline which is commonly prescribed medication in the treatment of uncomplicated malaria, rheumatoid arthritis, chronic discoid lupus erythematosus and systemic lupus erythematosus . It was developed during World War II as a derivative of quinacrine and was granted FDA approval in 1955. Since after investigating, it was found that accumulation of hydroxychloroquine raises the pH which thereby prevents the virus particles (corona viruses) from utilizing their activity for fusion and entry into the cell, the FDA revoked an emergency use authorization on 15 th June 2020. Hydroxychloroquine also inhibits terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 target for cell entry. Favipiravir is a modified pyrazine analog that was initially approved for therapeutic use in resistant cases of influenza (Figure 4(g) ). Favipiravir has been investigated for the treatment of life-threatening pathogens such as Ebola virus, Lassa virus and now COVID-19. Favipiravir functions as prodrug and undergoes ribosylation and phosphorylation intracellularly to become the active favipiravir-RTP (Favipiravirribofuranosyl-5 0 -triphosphate). Favipiravir-RTP binds to and inhibits RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which ultimately prevents viral transcription and replication. The RdRp catalytic domain is expected to be similar for other RNA viruses and hence it contributes to favipiravir's broad-spectrum coverage Sheahan et al., 2020) .",

So, selection of this plant was based on its diverse pharmacological activities such as antiviral, antidiabetic, antioxidant, immune-stimulant, easy cultivation approaches and resemblance to structure of coronavirus. The in silico studies, ADME analyses and in vitro interaction studies have suggested the important natural product-based hits for the comorbid and SARS-CoV-2 viral proteins. The molecular modeling and in silico pharmacokinetic analysis had put a great contribution and light to further wet lab analysis for drug discovery and development from M. dioica molecules and their kinetics as well as cell lines model studies are in progress. However, these natural molecules have significant in the drug discovery for multitargets of SARS-CoV-2 related infections.",

These metabolites in M. dioica have been previously reported to have antiviral, antidiabetic and immunomodulatory properties that are primarily necessary to be effective against the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Currently, as in the COVID-19 pandemic, there is rapid replicability of viral particles and lack of specific drugs and vaccines. So, it is need to apply concepts of Phyto pharmaceuticals to fight against the coronavirus and keep oneself away from the physical and mental stress. The phytoconstituents catechin, quercetin, hederagenin and oleanolic acid could serve as potential medicinal agents in COVID-19. In this present study, we screened the potential biological activities of phytoconstituents from spine gourd against the viral and comorbid proteases of SARS-CoV-2 using molecular modeling and to compared its efficacy in terms of binding energy with the drugs currently used in treatment of COVID-19.",

Among the metabolites, the triterpenoids hederagenin and oleanolic acid showed the best results of binding interaction with the viral macromolecules but according to in silico ADME predictions they both are relatively less efficient. This efficiency can be assured and experimented with strategies using wet lab analysis. The quercetin metabolite is best in terms of both analysis parameters such as binding affinity and drug likeness behavior. The reference drugs showed comparatively very less binding affinity toward viral proteases. Therefore, these compounds can be employed as therapeutic alternatives and can be utilized for further development of multitargeting drugs against SARS-CoV-2 infections. The present work may be used as a template for future discovery and development of novel multitargeting compounds against the viral disease. To the best of our knowledge, this study of potentially inhibiting properties of M. dioica toward coronavirus viral and comorbid proteins is novel.",
