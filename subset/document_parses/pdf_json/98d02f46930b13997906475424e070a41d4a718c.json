            "text": "As in many other countries worldwide, the coronavirus pandemic prompted the implementation of an \"intelligent lockdown\" in the spring of 2020 in the Netherlands, including the closure of nightlife venues and cancellation of festivals. Such restrictions and social distancing could particularly affect people who use alcohol or other drugs in recreational settings and give rise to new challenges and additional needs in the field of addiction prevention and care. To monitor changes in substance use and provide services with practical directions for tailored prevention, an anonymous web survey was set up, targeting a convenience sample aged 16 years or older through various social media and other online channels. Between May and October 2020, a total of 6,070 participants completed the survey, mainly adolescents and young adults (16-24 years old). These data were used to explore and describe changing patterns in substance use. Overall results showed declined current use compared to \"pre-corona,\" but mask underlying variation in changing patterns, including discontinued (tobacco 10.4%, alcohol 11.3%, cannabis 16.3%, other drugs 30.4%), decreased (tobacco 23.0%, alcohol 29.1%, cannabis 17.4%, other drugs 20.7%), unchanged (tobacco 30.3%, alcohol 21.2%, cannabis 22.3%, other drugs 17.3%), increased (tobacco 29.6%, alcohol 32.1%, cannabis 32.9%, other drugs 25.3%), and (re)commenced use (tobacco 6.7%, alcohol 6.3%, cannabis 11.1%, other drugs 6.2%). Especially the use of drugs like ecstasy and nitrous oxide was discontinued or decreased due to the lack of social occasions for use. Increased use was associated with coping motives for all substance types. As measures combatting the coronavirus may need to be practiced for some time to come, possibly leading to prolonged changes in substance use with lingering \"post-corona\" consequences, timely and ongoing monitoring of changing patterns of substance use is vital for informing prevention services within this field.",

Countries have taken drastic measures to contain the outbreak, from curfews to national quarantines. In March 2020, the Dutch government implemented a so-called \"intelligent lockdown\" to mitigate the spread of the virus. Daycare centers, schools and universities were closed, as were sports clubs, libraries, cinemas, theaters, museums, restaurants and nightlife venues; large social gatherings and events were canceled; almost all \"contact professions\" (e.g., hairdressers, driving instructors, physiotherapists) were suspended; both public and private meetings of people from different households were rigorously restricted; and 1.5-m social distancing and work-from-home orders were issued. In June most measures were lifted or relaxed (provided 1.5-m distance was maintained, thus restricting numbers of guests and customers), though festivals and club nights remained prohibited. However, rising infection rates warranted gradually more stringent measures from August onwards, yet again impeding social occasions like sports games, cultural outings, going out for drinks or dinner, or inviting friends to a party at home.",

Part of the mixed-methods approach is an annual on-site survey among varying target groups, including pub-goers and visitors of clubs and dance events. To address the needs of prevention services throughout the Netherlands for timely directions for targeted action an alternative nationwide online survey was set up. Interim national and regional results of the survey were regularly shared in dashboards and infographics within the Dutch network of prevention organizations to monitor changes in substance use patterns.",

The survey was set up as a monitoring tool, using a short questionnaire and a convenience sample, to provide descriptive results for prevention practice. The total sample was divided into subsamples of 3,310 respondents who had smoked tobacco either during the \"precorona\" month or last week, 5,176 respondents who had drank alcohol, 2,956 respondents who had used cannabis, and 3,072 respondents who had used other drugs (e.g., ecstasy, amphetamines, cocaine, nitrous oxide) in the \"pre-corona\" year or last month. Within these subsamples, overall results showed declined use compared to \"pre-corona.\" However, overall figures mask underlying variation in changing patterns, including discontinued (tobacco 10.4%, alcohol 11.3%, cannabis 16.3%, other drugs 30.4%), decreased (tobacco 23.0%, alcohol 29.1%, cannabis 17.4%, other drugs 20.7%), unchanged (tobacco 30.3%, alcohol 21.2%, cannabis 22.3%, other drugs 17.3%), increased (tobacco 29.6%, alcohol 32.1%, cannabis 32.9%, other drugs 25.3%), and (re)commenced use (tobacco 6.7%, alcohol 6.3%, cannabis 11.1%, other drugs 6.2%). Others have also found both less and more substance use following enforcement of coronavirus measures (12-16, 20-27, 29, 38) . The two opposite scenarios Rehm et al. (10) predicted from literature and a review of the effects of past economic crises on alcohol consumption, one with increased and one with decreased use, apparently coexist and also pertain to other substances. These results inform prevention practice about differential effects of corona measures on substance use that are masked by population trend curves, as the effects of opposite patterns of increased and decreased use cancel each other out.",

This finding contradicts other studies who reported heavier pre-pandemic drinking patterns among respondents with increased alcohol use (13, 20) . In this study, increased use of any of the substances was not associated with heavier \"pre-corona\" use. Current consumption of tobacco and cannabis was highest for respondents with unchanged use, while respondents with increased use showed most extensive current use of alcohol and other drugs, although the latter group did show lower prevalence rates for ecstasy, amphetamines, nitrous oxide and GHB.

All substances, regardless of change in use, were often used for pleasure and social reasons. In fact, the lack of social occasions was reported as the main reason for discontinued and decreased other drug use. But respondents with increased use of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and other drugs were also more likely to report additional reasons for use, in particular needing an outlet and wanting to feel less worried/afraid/angry/stressed or lonely. These reasons can be seen as coping motives, which have been linked to problematic use of alcohol [e.g., (39) ], cannabis [e.g., (40) ], and ecstasy [e.g., (41) ] in general, and have more specifically been found to mediate the link between stressors (having children at home, depression, social connectedness, income loss, and living alone) and alcohol-related problems during the coronavirus pandemic (42) .

Because of under-coverage some groups of users will be insufficiently presented in our sample (e.g., elderly or marginalized users), while self-selection may have caused our sample to be skewed toward young users who have experienced changing consumption patterns. Furthermore, the sample studied is relatively young (mainly 16-24 years).

When asked if using more or less drugs than \"pre-corona\" the reference time frame was the \"pre-corona\" year (15 March 2019-15 March 2020), but respondents may have reflected on the time directly preceding the coronavirus measures. This period is \"slow season\" for music festivals (29-53 per month in Jan-Mar 2019; 118-174 per month in Apr-Sep 2019) (46) , which are often preferred settings for drugs like ecstasy and nitrous oxide. Compared to that time, any drug use after the coronavirus measures came into effect could have felt like an increase in the respondents' minds. This may explain why respondents reported increased use of other drugs that could not be corroborated with increased prevalence rates. Measuring change in other drug use in a single question also impedes the ability to examine more complex patterns like selection (choosing a particular drug to use or quit) or substitution (replacing one drug with another).",

This was based on the frequency and amount of use in two relatively short periods for tobacco, alcohol and cannabis (\"pre-corona\" month and last week). Neither of these periods may have reflected \"typical\" consumption patterns and any absence of use may be \"coincidental.\" Discontinued use (defined as \"pre-corona\" use, but no last week use), for instance, may also include incidental (non-weekly) use and does not necessarily imply that there has not been any use since the coronavirus measures came into effect. Furthermore, increased and decreased use was derived from the difference in weekly consumption. In some cases differences were limited to only a few cigarettes/glasses/joints per week. For one person a small decrease in substance use may imply a clinically relevant risk level reduction, while for another a large decrease may not affect risk level outcome. For example, a female decreasing weekly consumption from 15 to 13 glasses will thereby fall below the threshold of excessive drinking, defined as more than 14 glasses a week for females in the Netherlands (44), while for a female decreasing weekly consumption from 25 to 15 glasses the end point will not fall below the threshold and the risk level outcome will remain that of excessive drinking. The current classification of changing patterns does not discern between these two examples and both are assigned to the \"less\" group. The aim of this paper was to explore different patterns of change in substance use. A more comprehensive examination of decreased or increased use may take different end points in terms of amount and frequency into account, but the survey did not measure any functional outcomes (e.g., health or use-related problems).",
