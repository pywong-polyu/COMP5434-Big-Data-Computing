The country has experienced several epidemics including; Ebola, Marburg, plague, Rift Valley fever, yellow fever and Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever. Epidemics overwhelm health systems, devastate economies and cause global health insecurity. These public health challenges arising from the interaction of humans-animals-environment link require a holistic approach referred to as One Health (OH). OH is the collaborative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally, and globally, to attain optimal health for people, animals, and the environment. Given its situation, Uganda has embraced the OH approach in order to be able to predict, prepare and respond to these public health challenges effectively, though still in infancy stages. In this paper, we present major achievements and challenges of OH implementation, and make recommendations for systematic and sustainable OH implementation. Achievements include: formation of the National One Health (NOH) platform with a Memorandum of Understanding between sectors; a national priority list of zoonotic diseases, the NOH Strategic Plan and a One Health communication strategy to strengthen engagement across sectors and stakeholders. There have also been efforts to integrate OH in academia. The challenges are related to inadequate; coordination across sectors, government commitment, advocacy and awareness creation and research. For systematic and sustainable OH engagements, urgent efforts should be made through government support to address current and related future challenges.",

            "text": "Globally about 75% of newly emerging infectious diseases and 60% of all human infections are of animal origin (zoonoses) [1] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one or more new infectious diseases have emerged each year since the 1970s [2] . This has resulted from closer proximity of animals and humans than ever before due to several factors such as: population growth, urbanization, advances in transport and animal industry, deforestation and climate change [3] [4] [5] . This close interaction has led to increased transmission and quick spread of diseases from animals to humans [6, 7] , resulting into epidemics that can potentially overwhelm health systems, and devastate economies [8, 9] , lead to morbidity and mortality of both animals and humans [10] . Diseases have negative social and economic consequences as well as global health security [10] . Recognizing ecosystem linkages and interdependencies of humans, animals and the environment necessitates a holistic approach to health issues, referred to as One Health (OH). The OH strategy is necessary as there is need for more systematic and diverse experts working together in identifying and responding to global health threats arising at the humananimal-ecosystem interface [11] [12] [13] . The OH approach holds promise in mitigating public health threats [14] . The approach has been embraced by WHO, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the Global Health Security Agenda (GHSA) as a strategy for promoting the collaborative effort of multiple disciplines working locally, nationally and globally, to attain optimal health for people, animals and the environment [14] . In this paper the authors describe the experience of Uganda including its achievements, opportunities, challenges and recommendations for implementing the OH approach. We start with a brief description of the rationale for and achievements in implementing a OH agenda in the country. This is followed by a description of the challenges that have been faced and continue to face in operationalizing the OH strategy, including what needs to be done to improve the implementation. This is based on available literature and drawn from the authors experience of working with the One Health Central and Eastern Africa Project [now Africa One Health University Network (AFROHUN)] in Uganda [15] .",

In the recent past, the country has experienced several epidemics including Ebola, Marburg, plague, avian influenza, Rift Valley Fever (RVF), yellow fever and Crimean Congo Haemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) [16] . In addition, a number of zoonotic diseases such as brucellosis, rabies, trypanosomiasis and anthrax are endemic in Uganda [17] . Recently, the country experienced an increase in frequency and intensity of extreme weather variability and epidemics ranging from vector borne to other zoonotic disease outbreaks. For example, RVF which is usually triggered by sustained heavy rains was for the first time reported in Uganda in the South Western part of the country in March 2016 [17] . Uganda also has one of the fastest population growth globally [18] which has resulted in land degradation, wildlife poaching, loss of biodiversity, and increasingly variable climate patterns [19] . This promotes close human interactions with animals that carry new threats [20] [21] [22] . In addition, there is a mounting problem of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) with nearly 70% of Enterobacteriaceae isolated from blood cultures at a tertiary hospital in 2014-15 were found to be resistant to third generation cephalosporin and 20% resistant to carbapenem [23] . AMR is a very complex problem, much more multifaceted than any other infectious threat, posing a significant challenge to global health and animal production with significant economic consequences [24] . It is a direct consequence of the selection pressure from antibiotic use in humans, animals, and the environment, thus its control and containment requires a OH approach [24] . Epidemics overwhelm health systems, cause social disruptions and devastate economies. For example recurrent oubreaks of Ebola, Marburg, CCHF, RVF and the current COVID-19 in Uganda, have posed heavy impact on the country in terms economic burden-with interruption of international trade and tourism, in addition to social disruptions and straining health systems [16, 25, 26] . Therefore, efforts that integrate inputs from multidisciplinary and diverse sets of knowledge holders are needed to understand the risks and find solutions. Multidisciplinary collaborations will significantly advance the fundamental understanding of emerging health threats and spur the development of initiatives that decrease vulnerabilities of communities and ecosystems [11] .

This compartmentalization has been criticized less desirable in low income countries, where the zoonotic disease burden is high. A joint approach on diagnosis, data sharing, monitoring and surveillance systems, training and interventions has been recommended [5, 23] because it improves opportunities to prevent pathogens from 'spilling over' from one species to another [33] . Collaboration and cooperation have been recommended to be critical because they are fundamental to linking these independent pillars of OH i.e. human and animal health systems and environmental health and management, to ensure that maximum sustainable health and economic benefits are achieved in the most efficient manner [24] .",

However, apart from having meetings of NTF, the ZDCO, OH technical working and partners, there is little attempt to operationalize OH beyond meetings hence actual collaboration in implementation has largely not been achieved. This is similar to what Lee and Brumme [34] reported in their paper on operationalizing of OH at a global level. In a marburg outbreak of 2017, late and lack of involvement of some of key stakeholders and weak leadership and coordination structures at the centre and the districts was highlighted as a major challenge [26] . From a stake holder mapping of OH, several barriers to operationalizing OH in Uganda were noted including: (i) Unstreamlined collaboration and communication among sectors including poor personal relations among staff within the sectors which affects communication; (ii) Lack of effective coordination and commitment to OH preparedness and response efforts; (iii) Lack of an agreed mechanism for sharing information across sectors and partners; and (iv) Building consensus among sectors usually takes a long time. Consequently, national response to outbreaks still happens in silos, as the interventions are not well coordinated, despite having the same goal and joint meetings. One reason attributed to these fragmented initiatives is the lack of funding for OH activities in the country. For instance, the coordinating body (ZDCO) has no physical office, uses volunteer staff, and has no budget. OH activities such as response to outbreaks depend on availability of money in individual sectors and this results in disjointed participation, contrary to the OH approach resulting in wastage of resources and limited impact on disease prevention and control. In addition, although chairing the OH platform is on the rotational basis by technical directors of the key ministries (health, agriculture, wildlife and environment), the period of the term is just 6 months [17] . This is really not enough time for any impactful work to be done. It seems to be just a ceremonial activity with no serious expectations from the seating chair and ministry.",

In the workforce assessment report of 2016, several concerns regarding principles and roles of partnership were raised including different perspectives regarding which sector or institution should assume a lead role on OH, and lack of a clear collaboration processes [11, 34] . This is related to the established technical roles of individual sectors, and a reflection of the desire to protect institutional mandates and any future resources accruing to them [34] . Successful approaches that have been suggested include interdisciplinary surveillance, reporting and laboratory collaboration, coordinated data sharing and interpretation, and strong communication channels for disease reporting and rapid action [24] . There is need to invest in strong laboratory capacity and build coordination between laboratories of human and animal sectors, because this critical to equip countries to rapidly detect pathogens of public health concern and for the other disease pathogens. Rapid diagnosis is necessary in the containment of a disease-both known and novel, leading to less lengthy societal disruptions in the numerous sectors that can be affected during an epidemic (e.g., education systems, vaccination campaigns, tourism, supply chains, agricultural trade, etc) [24] .",

It is important for the Platform (NOHP) and other stakeholders to conduct targed advocacy especially the Parliament in order to push for approval of the national OH budget which should be sustained. Parliamentary approval of a OH budget should take into consideration the overall national socio-economic development where OH is central to the country's target of being a middle income country by 2040 [39] . This is also recommeded by the World Bank [24] . There is also need to design and conduct advocacy engagements with political leaders at national, district and community levels regarding the benefit of OH. In addition, increased mobilization of external assistance, and engagement of the private sector, Non-governmental Organizations and Civil Society Organizations through greater public-private partnerships is required to support national and lower level OH activities, given that these epidemics/ pandemics do not spare any sector. World Bank recommends that there is a need to provide for a balance between short and long-term actions. Immediate action is required in case of outbreaks, while for the longer term, the need to build capacity that performs core public health functions to the international standards established by OIE and WHO is critical. In addition, capacity for environmental health must be more fully established and integrated in public health systems along the prevent, detect, respond, and recover cascade to fully operationalize OH in the context of infectious disease but also more widely, such as protection of natural resources and systems [24] .",

Laws preventing environmental degradation and other public health threats that are OH related are needed. The wetlands coverage has significantly diminished, currently at 8.9% intact, 4.1% degraded and 2.6% completely lost. Deforestation has been a major challenge in Uganda leading to decline of forest cover from 24% in 1990 to 9% in 2017 and only 12% is under strict nature reserve [19] and continues to be lost at a fast rate with the recent give away of Budongo Central Forest Reserve for sugar growing. On a good note some of relevant bills are in the pipeline and these include the Climate Change and the National Environment Bills which were drafted and submitted to Parliament to review [19] . These need to be expidited and implemented. Relatedly, socio-economic drivers of OH challenges such as population explosion, poverty and their effects on land use should be addressed. Although, Uganda prioritized seven zoonotic diseases [30] , the policy on zoonoses mainly focuses on livestock production by: improving public health standards for animal products, and reducing economic losses in order to promote export of livestock and livestock products [15] . Based on this policy, the control of zoonotic diseases such as rabies from dogs which may not directly benefit the livestock economy may not be prioritised [32] . This example makes a good case for the technical value of OH, human rabies eradication efforts will not succeed if not addressed in animal populations [24] .",

The publicatione in particular success stories of OH in action would offer valuable lessons on how to implement and sustain the OH approach. There is a need for studies focusing on the establishment and maintenance of institutional arrangements for OH to provide answers to important questions (what, why, and how) to guide operationalization of OH [34] , see Table 1 .

Communities are therefore crucial in the design of appropriate, context-specific and acceptable interventions. The OH approach promotes participatory community-based approaches which take into account traditional and local knowledge [11] . This is consistent with the goals of the global health effort which stresses the value and necessity of seeking participation from local communities and building interventions that draw on their capacities and resources, rather than top-down approaches. For example in an outbreak of Marburg in Kween and Kapchorw districts in Uganda in 2017, the locals exposed themselves by visiting bat caves to get droppings to fertilize their soils [26] . In the same outbreak, there was community resistance during the response, hampering contact tracing and follow-up.

Incorporation of OH in teaching would ensure disciplines appreciate the contribution of other professions which will create a workforce and communities that embrace the OH approach. The training/delivery models could include joint lectures and practical/field work as has been demonstrated by OHCEA [15] . In addition to training, it is important to create career opportunities for OH trainees; especially the government should make deliberate effort to develop and implement a responsive recruitment mechanism capable of absorbing the OH workforce into employment. Furthermore, it will be important that the Government supports development of training infrastructure including 'OH Hubs' or 'Centers of Excellence' which will be central in providing a framework for capacity building and coordination of country-wide activities.",

OH is inclusive and useful in addressing a broad range of public health challenges facing human, animal and environmental health [24] . In addition to zoonotic diseases and AMR that are a result of human, animal and environment interaction and need urgent action include; pollution, biodiversity loss, food insecurity, climate change, chemical toxicology [24] .

Benefits of collaboration at a pragramitc level may include resource efficiencies in conducting routine work such as; transport sharing between the sectors for example transporting human and animal vaccines when conducting immunization outreaches, sample collection to enable surveillance for multiple priority diseases, etc. In addition, through expanded information access and coordinated implementation of projects such as sampling methodologies, time of data collection, multi-sectoral projects may also generate value through earlier or more complete and accurate understanding of disease ecology and epidemiology that leads to more efficient and effective risk management, with possible time savings in disease investigations and avoiding consequences of delays [24] . As pointed out in Conrad's paper [40] , documenting the added value of collaboration across disciplines in preventing and controlling neglected zoonotic diseases, and also other health challenges that are of OH concern is important. However, there is currenly little support for OH research training and career opportunities in Uganda that would help to enable OH strengthen collective action across sectors [24] .",
