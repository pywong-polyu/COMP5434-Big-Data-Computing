A relatively conserved set of clinical and demographic factors are now recognized to correlate with an increased risk for severe disease requiring hospitalization, mechanical ventilation and death [2] [3] [4] . Accurate methods of risk stratifying ambulatory patients at the point of test positivity has many possible applications, including prioritizing patients at highest risk of hospitalization for early treatments aimed to prevent progression to severe disease, such as monoclonal antibodies, which are both limited in availability and also more likely to be effective in high-risk groups. Several models have been proposed [3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .

As part of a systemwide COVID-19 response, Intermountain provides SARS-CoV-2 testing at 32 urgent care facilities, 23 emergency departments, and 16 community drive-up testing sites. During the study period, only polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays were performed (Thermofisher, Waltham, MA; Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA; Quidel, San Diego, CA, BioFire, Salt Lake City, UT; Roche, Basel, Switzerland). All testing required an order entered in the electronic health record (EHR) (Cerner, Kansas City, KS) by the ordering clinician through a structured form that requires the clinician to input the patient's clinical symptoms and epidemiological features.

Symptom data were extracted from the electronic test order form while demographic and co-morbidity data were obtained from the IPOC database and data warehouse using the Charlson and Elixhauser definitions [10, 11] . We defined immunosuppression as: recipient of a solid organ or hematopoietic stem cell transplant, on chemotherapy, biologic or other immunosuppressive agents targeting B or T cell activity, chronic corticosteroids at a prednisone-equivalent dose of 20mg per day or greater for more than 30 days, human immunodeficiency virus complicated by acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), heritable immunodeficiency. We defined obesity as body mass index (BMI) of greater than or equal to 30 [12] . Symptom and demographic data were complete; comorbidity data were complete insofar as patients had prior encounters in the integrated health system. Mortality data was captured via an existing linkage to state death records. We used a random number generator to divide the cohort into a 70% derivation cohort and 30% validation cohort. In the derivation cohort data, we fitted a multivariable logistic regression model for hospitalization within 14 days of testing, using clinical and demographic features. Predictors were prespecified before model development based on: clinical features that would be available at the time of testing for all ambulatory and emergency department patients regardless of testing venue (a criterion that precludes, for instance, laboratory data), biological plausibility of association with severity, and reproducibility in other studies in existing COVID-19 literature. We intentionally did not fit a model for mortality, but instead planned a priori to validate the ultimate model against that outcome. Model discrimination was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operator characteristic curve (AUROC) and model fit by evaluating R 2 using the Nagelkerke method because the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit is not valid in very large sample sizes [13, 14] .",

            "text": "From March 25 through October 1, 2020, 22,816 patients had a positive PCR test for SARS--CoV-2. The mean age was 40 years (see Table 1 ); 11,424 (50.1%) patients were female and 8753 (43.9%) identified as a member of a community of color (either non-white race or Hispanic or Latinx ethnicity). Patients had on average one significant medical comorbidity. 1419 (6.2%) of patients were admitted; of these, 799 (3.6%) tested positive in the emergency department during the encounter that culminated in admission. Overall 93 patients (0.4%) died within 28 days of their positive SARS-CoV-2 assay. Demographic and clinical features were very similar between derivation (n = 16,030) and hold-out validation (n = 6786) cohorts. Demographics for the temporally-independent validation cohort are presented in Table 2 . In the derivation cohort, clinical features by hospitalization status are reported in Table 3 . The primary multivariable model (see Table 4 ) demonstrated adequate model diagnostics [AUROC 0.824 (95% CI 0.809-0.840), Nagelkerke R 2 0.26]. Age, male sex, self-identification to a community of color, dyspnea and high-risk comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, obesity, immunosuppression and chronic neurologic disease were each associated with significantly greater odds of hospitalization. In an exploratory analysis in which individual comorbidities were replaced in the regression with a count of total comorbidities, the cumulative number of comorbidities was also significant (OR 1.4, 95% CI 1.3-1.5). In the planned sensitivity analysis excluding patients who were tested in the emergency department during Table 5 ) with the exception that the magnitude of risk of dyspnea was less in the ambulatory- only cohort (OR 2.1 vs 3.5), and the odds of immunosuppressed patients without palliative goals of care being admitted were greater (OR 7.0 vs 3.9). Criteria included in the probabilistic, simplified clinical prediction score are displayed in Table 6 . Because cumulative comorbidity count was significantly associated with poor outcomes, we included comorbidities in the simplified tool that were not individually associated with increased risk in the expanded logistic regression model. In the derivation cohort, the AUROC for the simplified clinical prediction score for 14-day hospitalization was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.81-0.84) and 0.8 (95% CI: 0.78-0.82) in the validation cohort. AUROC for 28-day allcause mortality in the derivation cohort was 0.91 (95% CI: 0.83-0.94) and in the hold-out validation cohort 0.80 (95% CI: 0.69-0.9). In the temporally-independent validation cohort, AUROC for hospitalization was 0.76 (95% CI 0.75-0.77) and for mortality 0.9 (95% CI 0.88-0.91). The scoring threshold that optimized sensitivity and specificity (by Youden's index [15] ) was 6 with test characteristics of 71.1% and 76.2% respectively (Table 7) . By comparison, in the derivation cohort, the AUROC for Charlson comorbidity index for predicting hospitalization was 0.74 (95% CI 0.72-0.77) and for mortality 0.82 (95% CI 0.69-0.95).",

Here we describe Table 6 . Simplified clinical prediction score for COVID-19 outcomes. a simple scoring model capable of accurately risk stratifying ambulatory and emergency department patients for COVID-19 for subsequent hospitalization and mortality. One of the primary strengths of this model is the simplified and easily calculable score using features that are widely accessible. In particular, our score does not require laboratory studies, which are unavailable in the majority of ambulatory patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2. While preserving discriminative value, this simple scoring system has potential to facilitate more widespread clinical application in settings lacking robust integration of informatics. The model was derived and validated in a very large and diverse population in the western United States and is based on risk factors for severe disease that are largely conserved across global populations, including age, male sex, overall comorbid burden, and shortness of breath at the time of risk stratification. These factors align closely with those included in models derived in other locations and populations [3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] 16, 17] .",

In the internal validation cohort, AUROC for predicting hospitalization for this model was 0.81. The Wollenstein-Betech model [8] used data from 91,000 Mexican patients, and demonstrated and AUROC of 0.62 using age, gender, chronic renal insufficiency, diabetes, immunosuppression, COPD, obesity, hypertension, tobacco use, cardiovascular disease and asthma. The Dashti model [5] was derived and internally validated in a cohort of more than 12,000 patients in Massachusetts, USA. Using age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking status and median household income, this score had an AUROC for hospitalization risk of 0.77. Finally, we also compared the performance of the Charlson comorbidity index [10] in our own data and found that it was not quite as discriminative for hospitalization, but equally accurate at predicting mortality.",

In COVID-19, it is now well-recognized that significant outcome differences among communities of color exist with respect to severe illness and hospitalization [19] despite adjustment for age, gender and underlying medical conditions [5, 6] . This remains poorly understood and may be due to social determinants of health, inadequate access to healthcare, or poorly-controlled co-morbidities. Because we anticipated application of this risk stratification model to aid in allocating preventive therapies in COVID, we, like other published models [5, 6] , chose to include race and ethnicity in our score.

It became clear that not only would the supply of drugs be inadequate initially to treat all patients qualifying under EUA criteria, but the capacity to administer infusions without compromising infection control in infusion sites would be even more limited. To address this limited resource situation, the Utah Crisis Standards of Care scarce medications committee was convened with the goal of equitably and efficiently matching available infusion capacity to patients at highest probability of hospitalization most likely to benefit. The simple scoring tool described herein was ultimately adopted because of the simplicity, widely accessible clinical features and validation in a large, representative local population. By regularly adjusting the eligibility criteria based on the risk score threshold that best calibrates current infusion capacity to the number of new cases in high-risk strata, this risk-targeted drug allocation strategy has provided an equitable and flexible means of drug delivery in the context of still-uncertain efficacy and limited resources.",
