Potential explanations for these differences include the prevalence of co-morbid conditions and heterogeneity along racial and ethnic lines, local institutional policies about KRT timing, the use of extracorporeal KRT beyond classical \"nephrological\" indications.

In a kidney histological analysis of the largest autopsy series so far on 26 patients with COVID-19 from China [27] , acute tubular injury ranging from mild to severe was almost always observed. Three biopsy specimens revealed segmental glomerular fibrin thrombi, 3 had pigmented tubular casts, and 7 were thought to have viral-like particles identified under electron microscopy (EM). What was perhaps most interesting of this study was that only 9/26 (34.6%) showed clinical Glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury Evidence of diffuse proximal tubule injury with loss of brush border, non-isometric vacuolar degeneration, and necrosis was reported in patients with COVID-19. In addition, erythrocyte aggregates obstructing the lumen of capillaries without platelet or fibrinoid material were present [22] Postmortem biopsies from patients with AKI showed severe ATN and lymphocyte/macrophage infiltration, along with positive viral antigen NP staining of tubules and complement components [5] Immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem kidney biopsies in AKI associated with septic shows neutrophils and macrophages in the glomeruli, and neutrophils in the tubulointerstitium. Cell proliferation and fibrin deposition are pronounced in the glomeruli and tubulointerstitium of sepsis-associated AKI [23, 24] Absence of viral detection by in situ RNA analysis in the kidney biopsies from two COVID-19 positive cases with collapsing glomerulopathy [33, 34] Absence of virus in serum, urine and kidney tissue by realtime RT-PCR, despite repeatedly positive nasopharyngeal swabs in a critically ill patient with ARDS and AKI [31] Considering the many complications that can induce acute tubulointerstitial injury in ICU patients with ARDS and AKI, the causal relationship between viral infection and tubular damage is questionable Acute tubular injury by light microscopy in autopsy series might represent autolysis, almost invariably observed in autopsy kidneys Viral kidney tropism Clusters of coronavirus-like particles with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium of the kidney were observed in EM specimens from an autopsy series [5, 22] and a native kidney biopsy [27] Putative coronavirus particles were present, though all other tests for coronavirus in kidney were negative [27] Multivescicular bodies (MVB) mimicking SARS-CoV-2 can be found in podocytes from COVID-19 negative patients, irrespective of the underlying kidney disease [22] In a COVID-19 patient with collapsing glomerulopathy, \"viral particles\" were described as tubuloreticular inclusions in the endothelial cells and podocytes (with the appearance of MVB), but no viral RNA signal was detected in biopsy tissue [27] Many cellular components and structures can masquerade as viruses. In fact, transmission EM of tissue sections are not specific or sensitive for viral particle detection, as many intracellular structures observed in podocytes and endothelial cells resemble viruses (\" viral-like particles\"). For example, endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions also called myxoviruslike particles [22] Purported virus particles in the cytoplasm of kidney tubular epithelium and podocytes could represent clathrin-coated vesicles, which are normal cell organelles involved in intracellular transport [23] Viral nephrotoxic effects SARS-CoV-2 viral load has been quantified in autopsy kidneys, together with single cell RNA sequencing of viral receptors in kidney specimens and in situ hybridization.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 701, "end": 705, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1393, "end": 1397, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1582, "end": 1585, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1891, "end": 1895, "text": "[23,", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1896, "end": 1899, "text": "24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2038, "end": 2042, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 2043, "end": 2046, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2217, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2728, "end": 2731, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2732, "end": 2735, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2763, "end": 2767, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2876, "end": 2880, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3036, "end": 3040, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3281, "end": 3285, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3666, "end": 3670, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 3868, "end": 3872, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 578, "end": 586, "text": "(Table 1", "ref_id": null}], "section": "A proposed pathogenesis of kidney injury"}, {"text": "This analysis has revealed viral RNA in microdissected portions of the same specimens, thus suggesting both viral entry and replication into kidney cells [29] Viral entry and replication do not necessarily translate into cytopathic damage, as best exemplified by other viral infections such as HIV [24] SARS-CoV, whose genome is largely similar to that of SARS-CoV-2, was shown to be capable of entering kidney cells and replicating-but did not cause apparent harm [25] There has not yet been reproducible proof of viral tropism with active infection, which would require the concurrent demonstration of kidney cell infection (i.e. viral entry) together with viral replication/cytopathy signs of AKI and 5/26 (19.2%) required KRT. Acute tubular necrosis may be related to a similar presentation as seen with sepsis-induced AKI, mediated by the inflammatory milieu [28, 29] . Sixteen patients out of 26 (61.5%) of patients were hypotensive or required vasopressor support, thus making poor perfusion another likely mechanism of tubular injury. Could SARS-CoV2 itself be playing a role in tubular injury? Viral entry via angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), expressed on proximal tubular cells, seems to support such a hypothesis [30, 31] . Additional support of this theory comes from the observation of spherical viral particles characteristic of viral inclusions on EM [27, 32, 33] as well as viral ribonucleic acid (RNA) detection [6] in the kidney. Of note, the presence of presumed viral particles and RNA have not been consistently reported throughout the literature (Table 1) , and many cell structures could mimic the virus itself (Table 1) . Whether or not the presence of virus is an incidental finding or indeed contributing to pathology has not been determined. One recent study detected SARS-CoV-2 in the kidneys of autopsy specimens using in situ hybridization and indirect immunofluorescence [34] . They noted preferential targeting of glomerular cells in the kidney, with viral detection also in liver, heart, brain, blood and most highly in the respiratory tract. It is likely, as suggested by the authors, that multiorgan tropism influences the course of COVID-19. The presence of fibrin thrombi typically points towards a diagnosis of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), though the hypercoagulable state in patients with COVID-19 raises the likelihood of thrombi both in pulmonary blood vessels [35] and within microvasculature of the kidney. It is also possible that thrombotic occlusion of large kidney blood vessels (e.g. renal artery, renal vein) may contribute to kidney injury. A kidney biopsy from a critically ill patient with COVID-19 showed a classical pattern of acute tubular injury (ATI) with marked regenerative changes and focal acute tubular necrosis (ATN) [36] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 154, "end": 158, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 298, "end": 302, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 465, "end": 469, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 864, "end": 868, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 869, "end": 872, "text": "29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1235, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1239, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1377, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1378, "end": 1381, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1382, "end": 1385, "text": "33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1436, "end": 1439, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1909, "end": 1913, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2414, "end": 2418, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2792, "end": 2796, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1575, "end": 1584, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1641, "end": 1650, "text": "(Table 1)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "A proposed pathogenesis of kidney injury"}, {"text": "Evidence of glomerular injury in patients with COVID-19 also exist, as documented by the presence of proteinuria or hematuria in up to 60% of the cases in some series [37] .

In fact, transmission EM of tissue sections are not specific or sensitive for viral particle detection, as many intracellular structures observed in podocytes and endothelial cells resemble viruses (\" viral-like particles\"). For example, endothelial tubuloreticular inclusions also called myxovirus-\nlike particles [22]\nPurported virus particles in the cytoplasm of kidney tubular epithelium and podocytes could represent clathrin-coated vesicles, which are normal cell organelles involved in intracel-\nlular transport [23]\n</td><td>There has not yet been reproducible proof of viral tropism with active infection, which would require the concurrent demon-\nstration of kidney cell infection (i.e. viral entry) together with viral replication/cytopathy\nelectron microscopy, COVID-19 novel corona virus disease infection\n</td></tr><tr><td>\u2009Summary of evidence in favor of and against direct SARS-CoV2-mediated pathogenesis of acute kidney injury (AKI)\nTransient proteinuria and hematuria are common in critically  ill patients\n</td><td>Immunohistochemical analysis of postmortem kidney  biopsies in AKI associated with septic shows neutrophils and macrophages in the glomeruli, and neutrophils in the tubulointerstitium. Cell proliferation and fibrin deposition are pronounced in the glomeruli and tubulointerstitium of sepsis-associated AKI [23, 24]\n</td><td>Absence of viral detection by in situ RNA analysis in the kidney biopsies from two COVID-19 positive cases with collapsing glomerulopathy [33, 34]\nAbsence of virus in serum, urine and kidney tissue by real-\ntime RT-PCR, despite repeatedly positive nasopharyngeal swabs in a critically ill patient with ARDS and AKI [31]\n</td><td>Putative coronavirus particles were present, though all other  tests for coronavirus in kidney were negative [27]\nMultivescicular bodies (MVB) mimicking SARS-CoV-2 can be found in podocytes from COVID-19 negative patients, irrespective of the underlying kidney disease [22]\nIn a COVID-19 patient with collapsing glomerulopathy, \"viral particles\" were described as tubuloreticular inclusions in the endothelial cells and podocytes (with the appearance of MVB), but no viral RNA signal was detected in biopsy tissue [27]\n</td><td>Viral entry and replication do not necessarily translate into  cytopathic damage, as best exemplified by other viral infec-\ntions such as HIV [24]\nSARS-CoV, whose genome is largely similar to that of SARS-\nCoV-2, was shown to be capable of entering kidney cells and replicating-but did not cause apparent harm [25]\nacute respiratory distress syndrome, ATN acute tubular necrosis, RNA ribonucleic acid, EM </td></tr><tr><td>Table\u202f1\u2002Urinalysis abnormalities\nUrinalysis abnormalities (proteinuria, hematuria) commonly occur in the patients with COVID-19 [17]\n</td><td>Glomerular and tubulointerstitial injury\n</td><td>Evidence of diffuse proximal tubule injury with loss of brush border, non-isometric vacuolar degeneration, and necrosis was reported in patients with COVID-19. In addition, erythrocyte aggregates obstructing the lumen of capillaries without platelet or fibrinoid material were present [22]\n Postmortem biopsies from patients with AKI showed severe ATN and lymphocyte/macrophage infiltration, along with positive viral antigen NP staining of tubules and comple-\nment components [5]\n</td><td>Viral kidney tropism\nClusters of coronavirus-like particles with distinctive spikes in the tubular epithelium of the kidney were observed in EM specimens from an autopsy series [5, 22] and a native kidney biopsy [27]\n</td><td>Viral nephrotoxic effects\nSARS-CoV-2 viral load has been quantified in autopsy kidneys, together with single cell RNA sequencing of viral receptors in kidney specimens and in situ hybridization.
