Ferumoxytol, superparamagnetic iron oxide (SPIO) with low cytotoxicity, has been approved by FDA for clinical use. We synthesized novel nanoparticles BSNPs by coupling \u03b2-glucan with SPIO. BSNPs were further conjugated with fluorescein for quantitative analysis and trace detection of \u03b2-glucan on BSNPs. Inflammatory cytokine levels were measured by ELISA and qRT-PCR, and the phagocytosis of macrophages was detected by flow cytometry and confocal microscopy. The therapeutic effect of BSNPs was evaluated on the well-established sepsis mouse model induced by both clinical Escherichia coli (E. coli) and cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).",

BSNPs effectively reprogrammed macrophages to enhance the production of trained immunity markers and phagocytosis toward bacteria. BSNP-induced trained immunity protected mice against sepsis caused by E. coli and CLP and also against secondary infection. We found that BSNP treatment elevated Akt, S6, and 4EBP phosphorylation, while mTOR inhibitors decreased the trained immunity markers and phagocytosis enhanced by BSNPs. Furthermore, the PCR Array analysis revealed Igf1, Sesn1, Vegfa, and Rps6ka5 as possible key regulators of mTOR signaling during trained immunity. BSNP-induced trained immunity mainly regulated cellular signal transduction, protein modification, and cell cycle by modulating ATP binding and the kinase activity. Our results indicated that BSNPs induced trained immunity in an mTOR-dependent manner. Conclusion: Our data highlight that the trained immunity of macrophages is an effective strategy against sepsis and suggest that BSNPs are a powerful tool for inducing trained immunity to prevent and treat sepsis and secondary infections.",

After coupling with other materials, SPIO could be used for the diagnosis and treatment of lung [26] , liver [27] [28] , and colon cancers [29] . Disruption of iron homeostasis is a common feature of sepsis, characterized by decreased serum iron and transferrin levels [30] [31] . Lactoferrin supplementation reduced late-onset sepsis in preterm infants without adverse effects [32] . Our previous studies showed that SPIO alleviated LPS-induced sepsis in mice by promoting macrophages to secrete IL-10 [33] . However, it was still unclear whether proper engineering of SPIO with \u03b2-glucan could efficiently induce the trained immunity of macrophages against infection in sepsis.",

Dynamic Light Scattering showed that the hydration particle size of BSNPs was slightly increased to 30 nm ( Figure 2B ), and its zeta potential was -34 mV ( Figure 2C , Supplemental Table S5 ). Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy displayed the characteristic peaks of \u03b2-glucan and iron oxide core in BSNPs ( Figure 2D ). TEM images revealed a homogeneous dispersion of spherical BSNPs with an average diameter of 8 nm, approximately the same as SPIO ( Figure 2E ). These data confirmed the successful synthesis of BSNPs. We prepared fluorescence-labeled \u03b2-glucan (BG-RhB) to synthesize fluorescence-labeled BSNPs (BSNP-RhB) for the quantitative analysis of \u03b2-glucan. The spectrum of different concentrations of BG-RhB ( Figure 2F ) and the eluted ethanol containing the unbound BG-RhB were determined by Full-function Fluorescence Spectrometry ( Figure 2G ) (Supplemental Table S2 ). The mass ratio of \u03b2-glucan and SPIO on BSNP was 3:20, as calculated by the standard curve. When Raw264.7 cells were treated with different concentrations of SPIO or BSNPs for 24 h, cell viability was not affected even under the highest concentration at 800 \u03bcg/mL ( Figure 2H-I) .

Almost all BSNP-RhB positive cells were CD11b+ F4/80+ macrophages ( Figure 2N-O) , indicating that the macrophages could ingest more BSNPs that were degraded slower than \u03b2-glucan.

To evaluate whether BSNPs could induce trained immunity in macrophages, peritoneal macrophages and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) were obtained from the trained immunity mice and then stimulated with E. coli a ex vivo ( Figure 3A , Supplementary Figure S2A) . Consistent with the previous study [41] [42] , \u03b2-glucan treatment enhanced TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 mRNA expression ( Figure 3B ). SPIO treatment had little effect on these inflammatory factors, while BSNP treatment significantly raised their mRNA expression ( Figure 3B , Supplementary Figure S2B ). Moreover, TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 were significantly higher inside BSNP-treated cells than other treatments ( Figure 3C , Supplementary Figure  S2C ), suggesting that BSNP treatment enhanced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines by macrophages. Similar results were obtained using the macrophage cell line Raw264.7 ( Figure 3D-E) .

To investigate the mechanism underlying the superior therapeutic efficacy of BSNPs, we examined the phosphorylation of upstream and downstream proteins S6 and 4EBP in the mTOR pathway using the in vitro trained immunity model with macrophage cell line Raw264.7 ( Figure 7A ). Akt, S6, and 4EBP phosphorylation levels increased after BSNP treatment than after \u03b2-glucan treatment, but there was no significant difference in S6 and 4EBP phosphorylation levels between the two groups. While SPIO treatment and combined treatment with \u03b2-glucan and SPIO did not affect the phosphorylation of Akt, the phosphorylation of S6 and 4EBP was up-regulated ( Figure 7B-C) . Next, we treated Raw264.7 cells with mTOR inhibitors 2 h before BSNP treatment. Rapamycin, Torkinib, and WAY600 were used to inhibit the activity of mTOR complex1, complex 1 and 2, and the assembly of mTOR complex \u00bd, respectively ( Figure  7D ). BSNP-induced phosphorylation of Akt, S6, and 4EBP was inhibited by Rapamycin, Torkinib, and WAY600 ( Figure 7E-F) . Subsequently, Raw264.7 cells treated with mTOR inhibitors followed by BSNPs were stimulated by LPS for 6 h. The upregulation of TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 was significantly decreased by these inhibitors ( Figure  7G ). Furthermore, macrophages from each group were co-cultured with E. coli a -pHrodo for 1 h. Flow cytometry showed that BSNP-induced phagocytosis was also significantly decreased by these inhibitors ( Figure 7H ). These data suggested that BSNP-induced trained immunity was mTOR dependent.",

It has been shown that SPIO engineered to escape the immune recognition could be less taken up by macrophages, thereby lengthening the retention time of SPIO [51] and reducing the inflammation induced by SPIO [52] . Combining small molecule drugs or antibodies with SPIO could reduce their toxicity and increase their efficacy [53] . In the present study, we successfully synthesized novel BSNPs by coupling \u03b2-glucan and SPIO, significantly reducing the dose of \u03b2-glucan from 500 \u03bcg per mouse to 22.5 \u03bcg on BSNPs per mouse for inducing trained immunity and lowering the possible toxicity. We performed in vitro and in vivo experiments and found that BSNP treatment was superior to \u03b2-glucan in promoting macrophages to produce cytokines in vivo but not in vitro. Macrophages from BSNP-treated mice produced more inflammatory cytokines than \u03b2-glucan-treated mice, but there was no significant difference in Raw264.7 cells between BSNP and \u03b2-glucan. These observations indicated that BSNP uptake by peritoneal macrophages in mice was improved compared to cultured macrophages due to the coupling of \u03b2-glucan with SPIO and also because the characteristics of peritoneal macrophages were different from Raw264.7 cells. Thus, our study showed that nanoparticles were easier for uptake by macrophages in vivo than in vitro.",

Although the \u03b2-glucan treatment had little effect on ferroportin1, SPIO could significantly raise ferroportin1 (FPN1) expression (Supplementary Figure S7A) . However, in our study, treatment with \u03b2-glucan, SPIO, or combined \u03b2-glucan and SPIO protected FPN1-deficient mice against sepsis, manifested by reduced blood bacterial burden and lung damage (Supplementary Figure S7B-E) . These results suggested that \u03b2-glucan and SPIO treatment effects were independent of the classical iron metabolism pathway. Also, lipocalin-2 is considered as a standby iron transporter under FPN1 deficiency [58] . In lipocalin-2-deficient mice, brain injury caused by LPS was severer than normal mice [59] . However, lipocalin-2 protein expression and secretion were not different among \u03b2-glucan-, SPIO-, combined \u03b2-glucan-SPIO-, or BSNP-treated macrophages (Supplementary Figure S8) . These data suggested that BSNP-induced trained immunity was likely independent of lipocalin-2. Thus, the link between iron metabolism and trained immunity remains unclear.",
