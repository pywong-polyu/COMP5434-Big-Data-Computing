SARS-CoV-2 caused a pandemic in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and is rapidly spreading globally. It has been reported that peptide-like anti-HIV-1 drugs are effective against SARS-CoV Main protease (M pro ). Due to the close phylogenetic relationship between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, their main proteases share many structural and functional features. Thus, these drugs are also regarded as potential drug candidates targeting SARS-CoV-2 M pro . However, the mechanism of action of SARS-CoV-2 M pro at the atomic-level is unknown. In the present study, we revealed key interactions between SARS-CoV-2 M pro and three drug candidates by performing pharmacophore modeling and 1 \u03bcs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. His41, Gly143, and Glu166 formed interactions with the functional groups that were common among peptide-like inhibitors in all MD simulations. These interactions are important targets for potential drugs against SARS-CoV-2 M pro .",

When aligned, they show a sequence identity of 96%, and only the A46S mutation is located on the inhibitor binding site. Although no effective antivirals or vaccines against COVID-19 are currently reported, peptide-like HIV-1 protease inhibitors such as lopinavir and ritonavir have been reported to be effective against SARS-CoV M pro8, 9 .

This study focused on SBDD to discover three-dimensional insight for target binding. Pharmacophore modeling is one of LBDD techniques to discover common features of ligands to bind to the target protein 17 . Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, in which the dynamics of biopolymers in solution can be analyzed at the atomic level, is a typical SBDD method used to predict the interaction between proteins and inhibitors [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . MD simulation is based on Newton's equation of motion and has been applied to biomolecules such as proteins, nucleic acids, and lipid membranes [27] [28] [29] [30] . Recent studies have shown that MD simulations can be applied to clarify the binding mechanism between proteins and compounds at the molecular level, which is highly useful for rational drug design [22] [23] [24] [31] [32] [33] [34] .

To construct a SARS-CoV-2 M pro -inhibitor model, we performed structure alignment between SARS-CoV M pro -inhibitor complex structures and the SARS-CoV-2 M pro structure. Figure 2A shows SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors aligned with the pharmacophore model indicating the features of common functional groups of SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors, namely 2A5I ligand and 2OP9 ligand, and Fig. 2B shows the positional relationship of the pharmacophore. Using Phase software, two pharmacophore candidates, which were common among three ligands and had four pharmacophore points, were obtained (Fig. S1 ). These candidates had the same interactions, but slightly different 3D coordinates. It is because a pharmacophore is initially developed from single reference ligand by Phase algorithm, and two candidates were developed from different reference ligands. The pharmacophore that fits other active ligands more were chosen, by using (1) the root-mean-squared deviation (RMSD) in the pharmacophore point positions, and (2) the cosine of the angles formed by corresponding pairs of donor/acceptor. The total \"screen score\" (higher is better) of three active ligands are 5.34 and 5.07, respectively. The structural alignment and the pharmacophore model revealed that these inhibitors have two H-bond donor (HBD) functional groups and two H-bond acceptor (HBA) functional groups as common features. These features are located on www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the carbonyl oxygen atom and the amine, which forms peptide bonds in the backbone of peptide-like inhibitor. The blue stick molecule in Fig. 2A indicates the predicted conformation of indinavir to fit the pharmacophore model. Indinavir fits all four pharmacophore features built from the SARS-CoV M pro inhibitor. Figure 2C shows the amino acid residues around the chemical group defined as the pharmacophore. His41 and Gln189 are adjacent to the HBD sphere, and Gly143, Ser144, Cys145 and Glu166 are adjacent to the HBA sphere. His41's side chain is located where the lone pair of nitrogen atoms on the imidazole ring can contact the donor sphere. Also, the carbonyl oxygen in the side chain of Gln189 is located near the donor sphere. These residues may form hydrogen bonds with the HBD located on the donor sphere. On the other hand, the HBA sphere is located near the main chain of Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145. The HBA sphere has a high affinity for the backbone NH Group. The backbone of Glu166 is also located near the HBA sphere, which enables NH group on the Glu166 backbone to connect with the HBA sphere. In Fig. 2C , these distance between His41, Gly143, Met145, Glu166, Gln189, and each pharmacophore sphere are 3.58 \u00c5, 3.16 \u00c5, 3.12 \u00c5, 3.37 \u00c5, 1.72 \u00c5 respectively.",

The 2A5I ligand and indinavir showed that it formed two hydrogen bonds with Glu166. Also, the interaction with His41 was maintained with a high probability in www.nature.com/scientificreports/ all MD results (78%, 92%, and 94%). This residue continues to interact with inhibitors during each simulation ( Figure S5 ). Interactions with His41 were classified into two types: hydrogen bonding and Pi-stacking. In the interaction with His41, most of the hydrogen bond interactions were strongly connected. With the 2OP9 ligand and indinavir, hydrogen bonds to Gly143 and Cys145 were observed with a probability of over 50% during simulation. These interactions form with the main chain of Gly143 and Cys145. Two interactions were observed between the 2OP9 ligand and Cys145, in which the amine group of Cys145 main chain and the thiol group of Cys145 side chain were involved. With the 2A5I ligand and the 2OP9 ligand, an interaction between Gln189 and the inhibitors was confirmed with a probability of over 30% during simulation. 2A5I ligand, 20P9 ligand, and indinavir have one or two water bridge interactions with a probability of over 30% each during simulation. Especially, water between 2OP9 ligand and E166 forms a water bridge with a probability of 60%. According to the results of indinavir, water bridges are formed with T190 and Q192 with a probability of over 70%. Table 1 shows amino acid residues having an interaction probability of over 30% in each simulation. Interaction of His41, Gly143, Met165, and Glu166 were observed in all MD simulations. The side chains of His41 and the main chains of Gly143 and Glu166 were involved in the interaction, and Met165 forms a van der Waals (vdW) interaction with the inhibitors. Table 2 shows the interactions probabilities related to pharmacophore during 1 \u03bcs MD simulation. Gly143-Acceptor and Met145-Acceptor are involved in the same pharmacophore point. Among pharmacophore interaction, His41-Donor and Glu166-Acceptor are highly stable during MD simulation for all compounds. Other interactions are also relatively stable except Met145-Acceptor of 2A5I ligand and Gln189-Donor of indinavir.",

In Fig. 2C , SARS-CoV M pro residues: His41, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, Glu166, and Gln189 were located near these pharmacophore spheres. Since these residues are conserved in SARS-CoV-2 M pro , the features observed in SARS-CoV M pro inhibitors will be located at similar positions in SARS-CoV-2 M pro and thus, have the potential to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Moreover, the three-dimensional structure of SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro is almost conserved (Fig. 1B) , and amino acid sequence identity value shows 96%. The pharmacophores do not contact unconserved amino acid residues in SARS-CoV M pro and SARS-CoV-2 M pro . Thus, inhibitors that are matched with these pharmacophores may have the potential to inhibit both M pro .",

            "text": "To investigate the potential of these compounds to bind SARS-CoV-2 M pro , we performed MD simulations for SARS-CoV-2 M pro -inhibitor complex models. We observed strong hydrogen bonding with Glu166 main chain. In addition, although the thiol group of Cys145 interacts to the 2OP9 ligand, it was confirmed that the main chains of Gly143, Ser144, and Cys145 also interact with each inhibitor. It is suggested that the interaction with these amino acid residues may not be affected by side chain mutations unless the binding site shape or the dynamics of each chain are changed. Interactions with His41 were confirmed as hydrogen bonding and Pistacking. In the hydrogen bond, NH in the imidazole ring of His41 works as HBD. In addition, the imidazole ring of His41 also forms Pi-stacking with each inhibitor. According to the results of pharmacophore modeling, HBD pharmacophore sphere is located near His41. In contrast, the MD simulations suggested that His41 works as HBD. Therefore, HBA functional group has the potential to contact with His41. MD simulations also www.nature.com/scientificreports/ suggested that aromatic functional groups have high affinity for His41. In each MD simulation, Gly143, Ser144, Cys145, Glu166, and Gln189 interact with functional groups defined as pharmacophore of peptide-like inhibitors. Therefore, interactions with these amino acid residues are important for binding to SARS-CoV-2 M pro . In these MD simulation results, all ligand has one or two water bridges. Therefore, it is suggested that water bridges are involved in M pro and inhibitor complex structure to stabilize the structure, functional groups of ligands can be extended to the space occupied by these waters. Figure 4 shows SARS-CoV-2 M pro with \u03b1-ketoamide inhibitors (PDBID: 6Y2G) 44 aligned to 6UL7. One hydroxyl group and two carbonyl groups of \u03b1-ketoamide are matched the pharmacophore model. However, one donor sphere is located at the nitrogen atom of the pyrimidine ring. Since this nitrogen atom has no hydrogen atom, it cannot function as a hydrogen bond donor. Comparing the structures of Gln189 in Figs. 2C and 4, the conformations of the side chains are different. Although the results of MD simulations suggested that the 2A5I ligand and the 2OP9 ligand interacted with Gln189, this structure has been suggested that the side chain conformation of Gln189 flexibly changes depending on the binding inhibitor. Irreversible inhibitors which have covalent bonds with Cys residue of SARS-CoV-2 M pro have already been reported 44 . Irreversible inhibitors that selectively inhibit M pro may have a higher binding affinity than competitive inhibitors and the inhibitors analyzed in this study are competitive inhibitors. However, drug repositioning is effective for highly urgent diseases such as COVID-19, and the pharmacophore proposed in this study can evaluate compounds which is not included a functional group to form a covalent bond with Cys. Therefore, the pharmacophore can be applicated for drug repositioning strategy. In summary, this study suggests that compounds matching the pharmacophore model have potential as coronavirus inhibitors. Although these results were obtained from peptide-like inhibitors, the formation of these interactions allows the design and search of non-peptide-like compounds. The pharmacophore features that are important for binding to SARS-CoV-2 M pro might help to develop new effective anti-coronavirus drugs.",
