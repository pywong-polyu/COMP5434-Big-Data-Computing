            "text": "We present a novel approach for exiting coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) lockdowns using a 'risk scorecard' to prioritize activities to resume whilst allowing safe reopening. Methods: We modelled cases generated in the community/week, incorporating parameters for social distancing, contact tracing and imported cases. We set thresholds for cases and analysed the effect of varying parameters. An online tool to facilitate country-specific use including the modification of parameters (https://sshsphdemos.shi nyapps.io/covid_riskbudget/) enables visualization of effects of parameter changes and trade-offs. Local outbreak investigation data from Singapore illustrate this. Results: Setting a threshold of 0.9 mean number of secondary cases arising from a case to keep R < 1, we showed that opening all activities excluding high-risk ones (e.g. nightclubs) allows cases to remain within threshold; while opening high-risk activities would exceed the threshold and result in escalating cases. An 80% reduction in imported cases per week (141 to 29) reduced steady-state cases by 30% (295 to 205). One-off surges in cases (due to superspreading) had no effect on the steady state if the R remains <1. Increasing the effectiveness of contact tracing (probability of a community case being isolated when infectious) by 33% (0.6 to 0.8) reduced cases by 22% (295 to 231). Cases grew exponentially if the product of the mean number of secondary cases arising from a case and (1-probability of case being isolated) was >1. Conclusions: Countries can utilize a 'risk scorecard' to balance relaxations for travel and domestic activity depending on factors that reduce disease impact, including hospital/ICU capacity, contact tracing, quarantine and vaccination. The tool enabled visualization of the combinations of imported cases and activity levels on the case numbers and the trade-offs required. For vaccination, a reduction factor should be applied both for likelihood of an infected case being present and a close contact getting infected.",

The economic and social costs of these widespread lockdowns have been severe. 1, 2 The long-term imposition of lockdown measures is not sustainable socially, economically and politically. Many countries exited from their first lockdowns with varying success in sustained control of COVID-19 transmission. 3 Even countries lauded for their initial effective lockdown policies have met with second waves of infection due to seeding of cases from inbound travel or relaxation of domestic control policies, resulting in the re-imposition of lockdown measures in many countries. 4-8 Frequent re-imposition of measures leads to substantial economic and social fallout and is undesirable. Lockdowns have given countries time to build up community public health measures, testing capabilities, improve contact tracing abilities and increase healthcare capacity. Used appropriately, these tools can aid countries in exiting lockdowns in a safe and sustainable manner.",

Trade-offs are necessary-as opening up international travel increases the possibility of imported cases though mitigated by the restrictions placed on travellers, and needs to be balanced against the relaxation of restrictions on domestic activity, in order to ensure lower rates of transmission arising from community cases. Trade-offs between various domestic activities also have to be made in order to keep the risk of community transmission and hence case numbers below acceptable limits. At the same time, testing and contact tracing capabilities can reduce the potential spread of community cases, hence allow for a greater degree of social interaction.",

We describe a model to enable the calculation of the effect of imported cases from travellers, and various community-based societal activities on disease transmission and their summation, considering the impact of mitigating measures such as social distancing policies, testing and containment/contact tracing capabilities.

Travellers pose a risk by importing cases into the country based on the incidence of COVID-19 in the country of travel origin-however, this can be mitigated by testing and quarantine regimes for travellers to reduce the COVID-19 exposures from travellers into the community. Travel therefore results in imported cases that do not have community exposure and will need to be managed within the healthcare capacity, and those that have community exposure and may contribute to further transmission. Overall, the number of cases in the previous week is contributed by imported cases and community cases and is influenced by traveller quarantine and testing regimes and contact tracing capabilities in the community respectively.

Values of the parameters can be changed to reflect the situation in respective countries or improvements in the effectiveness of mitigation measures based on research developments. Some countries have high prevalence of recovered and presumably immune individuals, and with the introduction of vaccines the level of immunity could be even higher through vaccination programs. The immunity level and the corresponding reduction in risk of infection can easily be included in the model to determine the risk score allowable under these new parameters. This would also allow policy makers to perform forward planning on what vaccinations could do for opening up society and the economy, and should be explored in future research studies.",

While they are generally of low economic value, they may have a substantial social or political lobby. While these activities in their pre-COVID-19 form have a high risk score, the nature of these activities can materially altered to reduce transmission in these settings. Conversely, events where the audience is seated with physical distancing, wearing masks, and do not generally interact have low S activity . Many of these have also have high economic or social value and may be prioritized to safely proceed. Using the worked example of Singapore, where this approach has been successfully implemented, several conclusions could be drawn. Firstly, in systems where each infected individual spreads to less than one person (i.e. reproduction number, R < 1), imported cases constitute 'injects' that may lead to further generations of community transmission, though overall case numbers will eventually drop to steady state, even in the face of continuing imported cases. The number of imported cases depends on the number of inbound travellers and the community incidence rates in the countries of origin. Effective travel restrictions, traveller quarantine and testing policies will reduce the number of infectious imported cases that interact with the community and result in further generations of cases.",

Prompt imposition of restrictions on air travel when there is local transmission from travellers in the destination country was shown to be effective in reducing spread. 14 For incoming travellers, quarantine for the incubation period and testing upon arrival and before release will reduce community transmission. A study 15 found that 79.6% of infected travellers are infectious upon arrival; screening with a 14-day isolation of test-positives followed by a negative test achieves a 91.7% reduction in secondary cases, versus only a 55.4% reduction for no screening but a 7-day mandatory quarantine. The degree of reduction can be further modified by altering the risk profile of travellers entering. Restricting arrivals to countries with low incidence rates or to vaccinated individuals, or imposing a quota on travellers from countries of higher risk or unvaccinated individuals, has been effective in preventing a surge in cases in the receiving country 16 ; however this policy needs to be frequently reviewed in response to epidemic trends and vaccine effectiveness.",

The widespread deployment of digital contact tracing tools may play a key role in improve the speed and completeness of quarantine of close contacts and therefore remove cases from circulating the community. [19] [20] [21] [22] The proportion of first-generation community cases remaining in the community (a function of the effectiveness of containment measures) and the number of second-generation cases arising from all activities undertaken by a particular case are inversely correlated at a given threshold of new cases per week, and the multiple of these two parameters should not exceed 1-otherwise, exponential increase in cases will occur. Even the best contact tracing system is unlikely to detect and remove 100% of contacts and cases from circulation in the community; therefore it would be prudent to maintain some degree of limitations on social activities compared to the pre-COVID-19 era. Having effective containment measures coupled with calibrated opening of social activities also allows the population to withstand the impact of one-off superspreading events that may produce large numbers of first-generation cases. All else unchanged, even after such one-off superspreading events, the number of new cases per week will eventually return to a steadystate, while the healthcare system may be placed under strain for a period of time, necessitating surge capacity to be in place. Therefore, it would be prudent to include a buffer in the risk scorecard to account for secondary unknown and unanticipated effects of further relaxations (e.g. a primary activity creating opportunities for further interaction), ongoing higher risk activities that are not known to governments, and reaction time for unexpected events.",
