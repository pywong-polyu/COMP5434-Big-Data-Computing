Routine written clinical consultation is provided with a concise, clinical \"action plan\" that presents core messages for primary care provider and patient use and supports clinical management and health education beyond the testing laboratory's reports. Access to genetic counseling is free in most cases. Predefined care pathways and access to genetics experts facilitates the appropriate use of results. This pilot tests the feasibility of routine, ethical, and scalable use of population genomic screening in healthcare despite generally imperfect genomic competency among both the public and health care providers.

CFIR's inner and outer settings and the individuals involved domains constitute the implementation context. Constructs probing the motivations and rationale reside in the outer setting, while the characteristics of an organization, like culture, structure, readiness, and priority, comprise the constructs of the inner setting.

Primary care providers do order pre-conception and prenatal screens and sample for newborn screening. Genomic literacy and competency among primary care providers is limited outside those areas. Upon receiving a positive genetic screening result, primary care providers' responsive actions may be limited to patient notification and referral to a relevant specialist, or to following scripts, such as those provided by newborn screening laboratories.

We underestimated the need for leadership engagement in HIT and the relative priority for planned system-wide HIT transformation, where tension for change was far higher. HIT resources were unavailable to build consent, order, and resulting experiences familiar to the PCPs. The EHR-plus-paper order process we used instead burdens clinic staff and dissuaded some PCPs from participating. This adaptation is also the principal source of tracked process errors. EHR-based improvements will be prioritized once the system-wide Epic implementation is completed in April 2022. A separate, secure data system was built internally to track the multiple process steps. The solution allows oversight but is neither interfaced nor scalable. The criterion that tested patients are attributable in Vermont's ACO was similarly challenging because ACO status is not reliably reflected in our EHR. It requires a manual inter-institutional lookup process.",
