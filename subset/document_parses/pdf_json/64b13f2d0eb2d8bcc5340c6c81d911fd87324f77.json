Persistence of elevated numbers of neutrophils correlates with worsening gas exchange and with poor prognosis [7] . The regulation of neutrophil lifespan is known to be critical for maintaining an effective host response and preventing excessive inflammation. One of the mechanisms that controls the number of neutrophils in the lung is the induction of apoptosis. Interestingly, neutrophils are less susceptible to undergo apoptosis under hypoxic conditions, as occurs in the alveoli in ARDS. In this line, the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) oxygen-sensing pathway has been shown to play a role in prolonging neutrophil survival during hypoxia. The expression and transcriptional activity of HIF are regulated by the oxygen-sensitive prolyl hydroxylases (PHD1-3) [8] . This suggests that modulation of HIF and PHD1-3 expression aimed at enhancing neutrophil apoptosis may be a potential approach to downregulate inflammation in the early phase of ARDS.",

Neutrophil elastase is a serine protease stored in the azurophilic granules of leukocytes that has been implicated in the pathology of ARDS. Neutrophil elastase seems to promote inflammation, endothelial and epithelial cell injury, extracellular matrix damage and collagen deposition that leads pulmonary fibrosis [9] [10] [11] . Sivelestat was the first neutrophil elastase inhibitor tested in humans and it suppressed the production of neutrophil elastase and interleukin (IL)-8, resulting in improved respiratory function in patients with ARDS secondary to cardiopulmonary bypass [12] . In animal models of lung fibrosis, sivelestat not only decreased inflammatory cell recruitment in the acute phase, but also reduced collagen deposition in lung parenchyma in the fibroproliferative phase of ARDS resulting in less fibrosis and better static compliance of the lung. This beneficial effect was also associated with a decrease in transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u02c71 activation and expression of phospho-SMAD2/3, which are mechanisms involved in lung fibrosis [9, 11] . AZD9668 (N-f[5-(methanesulfonyl)pyridin-2-yl]methylg -6-methyl-5-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-2-oxo-1-[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,2dihydropyridine-3-carboxamide) is another novel neutrophil elastase inhibitor that can be administered orally. It exerts selective and rapid inhibition of neutrophil elastase that is also reversible. Oral administration of AZD9668 to mice or rats prevented human neutrophil elastase-induced lung tissue injury as assessed by decreased matrix protein degradation products in BAL fluid and reduced inflammatory responses in the lung in acute and chronic lung injury models. Therefore, neutrophil elastase inhibitors may be drugs that could potentially reduce lung inflammation and diminish structural and functional pulmonary changes in human ARDS [13] .",

            "text": "Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) exerts a protective effect against ALI. S1P is a potent angiogenic factor that preserves human lung endothelial cell integrity and barrier function [16] preventing the alveolar flooding demonstrated in animal models of ARDS. S1P is a naturally occurring bioactive sphingolipid that acts extracellularly (via its G protein-coupled receptors, S1P1-5) and intracellularly on various targets. The synthesis of S1P is catalyzed by sphingosine kinases 1 and 2, and the degradation of S1P is mediated by lipid S1P phosphatases and S1P lyase, contributing to the control of the S1P cellular responses [15, 16] (Fig. 1) . S1P enhances vascular barrier function through a series of cellular events initiated by activation of its G-protein coupled receptor, S1P1, and the subsequent downstream activation of Rho and Rac1. Activation of these intracellular signals results in endothelial cytoskeletal reorganization to form strong cortical actin rings in the cell periphery, and reinforcement of focal adhesions and paracellular junctional complexes (cadherin, paxillin, catenins, zona occludens), that prevent excessive vascular permeability [16, 17] . Recent studies show that stimulating the S1P-SIP1 axis reduces vascular permeability, which can be of great value to treat ARDS. S1Ps and S1P analogs, such as FTY720 and ftysiponate, serve as protective agents limiting the disruption of the pulmonary microvascular endothelial barrier and lung edema formation, as well as attenuating parenchymal accumulation of inflammatory cells, which limit the development of ARDS [16, 18] . Another strategy is the prevention of degradation of S1P via inhibition of S1P lyase (S1PL). All these results can be particularly relevant as lung injury was associated with an enhanced S1PL expression and decreased S1P levels in lung tissue in some models of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ARDS. 2-acetyl-4(5)-[1(R),2(S),3(R),4-tetrahydroxybutyl]-imidazole inhibited S1PL in lung tissue and BAL fluid and reduced lung injury and inflammation in animal models [19] .",

Statins not only lower cholesterol, but also have other non-lipid-lowering effects that can be beneficial for the management of sepsis and sepsis-induced ARDS, particularly associated with pneumonia [22] . In this context, statins confer lung protection by preserving endothelial function and integrity, reducing vascular leak, and exerting anti-inflammatory and anti-thrombotic effects. In experimental studies of endotoxin-induced lung injury, simvastatin preserved protein permeability preventing lung edema formation, attenuated neutrophil migration to the lung, and reduced endothelial cell-derived cytokine expression (IL-6, IL-8, monocyte chemotactic protein [MCP]-1, regulated upon activation normal T cell expressed and presumably secreted [RANTES]). These protective effects of statins are mediated through the upregulation of the activity of integrin-\u02c74 in endothelial cells. These findings support statins as useful drugs and integrin-\u02c74 as a novel therapeutic target in patients with ALI [23] .",

Angiotensin II, a key effector peptide of the system, causes vasoconstriction and exerts multiple biological functions. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 are homologs with different key functions in the reninangiotensin system. ACE cleaves angiotensin I to generate angiotensin II, whereas ACE2 reduces angiotensin II levels and thereby functions as a negative regulator of the angiotensin system (Fig. 2) . Capillary blood vessels in the lung are a major site of ACE expression and angiotensin II production in the human body [28] . ACE, angiotensin II and the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) induce apoptosis in the alveolar wall, alter alveolar capillary barrier integrity leading to lung edema, and promote collagen deposition, which can result in lung fibrosis with the consequent impairment of lung function. In contrast, ACE2 and the angiotensin II type 2 receptor (AT2) protect against all these effects (Fig. 2) . Indeed, inhibiting ACE and AT1 as well as increasing ACE2 and AT2 activity attenuated lung injury in several animal models of ARDS, and may represent novel approaches for the treatment of ARDS [29] [30] [31] [32] .",

            "text": "Many drugs targeting endotoxin or the endotoxin-induced cytokine storm have been developed with therapeutic purposes in sepsis and sepsis-induced ARDS. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) is activated by LPS or endotoxin, the major component of the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, and constitutes a potent inflammatory stimulus implicated in septic shock and septic-induced ARDS. Activation of TLR4 by LPS depends on LPS binding protein (LBP)-catalyzed extraction and transfer of individual LPS molecules from aggregated LPS to CD14 and then from CD14 to MD2, followed by engagement and dimerization of TLR4. TLR4 signaling may also be activated by stimuli other than LPS. Chemical (acid aspiration) or virus (influenza) insults may cause ALI via the generation of host-derived, oxidized phospholipids that potently stimulate TLR-4 [33] . Eritoran is a potent, welltolerated, synthetic TLR4 antagonist that protects against influenza-induced ARDS in mice, improving the survival of these animals even when administered as late as 6 days post-infection. Eritoran binds to CD14, which inhibits ligand binding to MD2:TLR4 complexes preventing TLR4 dimerization and activation [34] . In viral infection, eritoran blocks oxidized phospholipid-induced TLR4 signaling, mitigates the subsequent cytokine storm, and also helps to control viral titer. Despite the lack of benefit in severe septic patients (ACCESS trial) [38] , eritoran could still be effective in influenza infection and, perhaps, in ALI mediated by non-infectious agents, but its most effective timing and dosing remain unknown. Based on endotoxin challenge studies in animals, the prophylactic or very early administration of eritoran in patients at-risk or with ARDS could be more effective in controlling the 'sepsis cascade'. Antagonism of TLR4 signaling could therefore become a useful therapy for ARDS [35, 36] .",

These results identify integrins and selectins as promising therapeutic targets for ALI, in particular in sepsis-induced ARDS [39] . Inhibition of these integrins by specific antibodies has shown therapeutic effects in models of septic shock [40, 41] .

Administration of mepyramine (H1-receptor antagonist) or ranitidine (H 2 -receptor antagonist) attenuates the increased histamine concentration, but only the administration of ranitidine was associated with a significant reduction in neutrophil numbers and in protein permeability. This study suggests that endogenous histamine may be involved in the recruitment of neutrophils and protein leaks in endotoxin-induced ALI via the H 2 receptors [44] .

EPO provides protection by modulating multiple early signaling pathways involved in apoptosis, inflammation and peroxidation. Furthermore, EPO appears to confer vascular protection by promoting angiogenesis. However, only preliminary studies exist and more experimental and clinical data are necessary to clarify the efficacy and cytoprotective mechanisms of EPO [47] .",

Hyaluronan and its degradation products, produced by hyaluronidase enzymes and reactive oxygen species (ROS), are implicated in different aspects of the ALI process. The different activities of hyaluronan and its degradation products are regulated by multiple hyaluronan-binding proteins, including CD44, TLR4, hyaluronan-binding protein 2 (HABP2), and receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM). Recent research indicates that exogenous administration of high molecular weight hyaluronan can serve as a novel therapeutic intervention for lung diseases, including LPS-induced ALI, sepsis/VILI, and airway hyperactivity [48] .",

For example, nanosized micelles have been developed to trigger receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1), ROS and heat shock protein (Hsp)90, all effectors thought to be in-volved in ALI. The main limitations of some peptide drugs for clinical use are the short half-life (minutes) and their water-insolubility. To overcome these limitations, some groups have developed micellar-targeted peptides in which the peptide drug remains in its active form for longer (hours) and increases its stability and bioavailability [49] . These long-acting micellar nanomedicines have provided significant advancement in the treatment of ARDS in experimental models, which could be extended to the clinical setting. Another advance is the novel nanovesicle aerosols composed of non-lamellar phospholipids that were developed as pulmonary surfactant aerosols and have been successfully used as therapy in mice with acid-induced lung injury. Currently existing intratracheal surfactants are ineffective because they are inactivated by albumin leakage and other mechanisms. The nanovesicle aerosols of non-lamellar lipids improve the resistance of pulmonary surfactants to inhibition, and may therefore be promising as a non-invasive aerosol therapy in ALI [50] .",

Multiple biochemical and biological targets, however, have been identified that could give rise to future drug discovery and development. Several aspects should be taken into account in order to guarantee the efficacy of those potential new drugs. Better stratification may help to identify subgroups of patients with ARDS that benefit from targeted interventions, given the heterogeneity of patients with ARDS and the multiple etiologies of this disease (direct versus indirect ARDS). Combinations of different therapeutic strategies could also improve outcomes for these patients compared with therapies based on single agents. Finally, we also need to optimize the dose, timing and route of administration as well as to determine the potential toxicity of the novel pharmacologic agents for their future use in the management of patients with ARDS.",
