Most of the latter were also detected in the four samples of surrounding air. Out of the eleven identified human VOCs, five were found to vary significantly in signal intensity. These five VOCs were identified as isoprene, decane, nonane, nonanal and dodecane. Post hoc analysis showed that only isoprene significantly increased 30 min after hyperbaric exposure. The other VOCs demonstrated a fairly constant or decreasing trend, with two VOCs (nonane and nonanal) showing significant reductions in intensity between 2 and 4 h after treatment ( Figures 1A-E) .

The only difference was the number of air brakes at 9 m, which was three times more frequent in the table used in this study, but without change in the total breathing minutes for both gasses. Specifically, the table used in the present study had three breaks of 5 min each per hour, whereas the US Navy TT6 had one break of 15 min per hour. POT and CNS-OT in rodents may be reduced when a period with greatly increased partial pressure for oxygen is followed by a lower partial oxygen pressure or even a normoxic period at constant ambient pressure (Arieli and Gutterman, 1997; Chavko et al., 2008) . This protective effect at similar total oxygen exposure times was greater when alternating hyperoxic-normoxic schedules were more rather than less frequent (Arieli and Gutterman, 1997; Zhang et al., 2019) . These findings suggest that the incidence of POT would be lower with our modified TT6, with more frequently alternating oxygen-air periods at 9 m, than with the original US Navy TT6. However, it remains to be determined whether more frequent air brakes affect the development of POT in human subjects.",

Substances not originating from lipid peroxidation, such as nonanal, methylcyclohexane and isoprene, have been associated with inflammatory processes, oxidative stress responses and cellular metabolism (Gaida et al., 2016; Lamote et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2018) .",

Various hypotheses have been suggested, including the temporary upregulation of antioxidant mechanisms, such as increases in ROS-scavenger enzyme activity, increased (methyl) alkane metabolism and other as yet unknown processes (Pietarinen-Runtti, 2000) . Several studies on VOCs in cancer patients have found reduced levels of alkanes and methylalkanes in breath samples. These differences may be due to metabolic alterations resulting from the illness itself or increases in cytochrome P450 activity and other metabolic processes that convert alkanes to alcohols, which are highly soluble in blood and tissues and therefore not as volatile as less soluble compounds (Hakim et al., 2012; Blanchet et al., 2017) .",

This compound is part of the cholesterol synthesis pathway, with its concentration in exhaled air being highly variable. Because isoprene in breath is little affected by exogenous exposure, such as uptake through food, and is not produced in the respiratory tract, it can be used to monitor cellular metabolic processes. Due to its lipophilic properties and low boiling point it is also an indicator of ventilation rate. Exhaled isoprene levels increase markedly at the start of physical exercise when ventilation rate and metabolism increase, and decrease during sleep when metabolism and ventilation are reduced (King et al., 2009) . Although isoprene is an antioxidant in plants (Pollastri et al., 2021) , it has not been shown to have antioxidant activity in humans. The present study found that isoprene levels were significantly higher 30 min after exposure than at baseline, but decreased at 2 h. Generally, exhaled isoprene levels tend to rise in the morning and peak around noon, dip in the late afternoon, and level out in the evening, with this pattern being more distinctive in patients with asthma than in healthy individuals (Wilkinson et al., 2019) . The individuals in the present study showed the same pattern, suggesting that they had experienced minor pulmonary irritation or that the pattern was due to increased mobilization of the test subjects after they had been seated for 5 h.",

Prior to this study, they had no recent pulmonary exposure to known irritants, such as hyperbaric exposure in the days prior to the trial, prolonged exposure to normobaric oxygen or tobacco smoke or recent respiratory tract infections. Findings in these study subjects may differ from those in stricken divers requiring recompression therapy after diving accidents. Hyperbaric treatment of injured divers and patients with prior exposure to increased partial oxygen pressure may result in additional hyperoxic stresses, leading to increased VOC intensities and the development of POT. Nevertheless, like all therapeutic interventions, the benefits of treatment should be weighed against its potential disadvantages. Refraining from necessary hyperbaric therapy due to fear of inducing POT is most likely to disadvantage patients. In the absence of overwhelming indications of POT, patients should receive hyperbaric therapy.",

Although this indicates that this cluster very likely matches one of these compounds, the exact compound could not be determined. Isomers, such as nonane and 2,4 dimethylheptane, frequently show similar findings, making them hard to distinguish by GC-MS analysis. All three compounds are of human origin, have been found in breath samples of patients affected by asthma or various malignancies, and could be fragments of disrupted cellular membranes (Haick et al., 2014; The Human Metabolome Database, 2021) .

For example, the subjects of this study, all of whom were experienced hyperbaric personnel, would likely know if they were exposed to the regular TT6 pressures or to a sham regimen. Furthermore, breathing ambient air with 21% oxygen instead of 100% at depth exposes the lungs to a higher partial oxygen pressure than normobaric normoxic exposure. Thus, the control group would still be exposed to the irritant, albeit to a lesser extent. Additionally, breathing air or other gas mixtures with inert gas fractions such as nitrox or heliox for a prolonged amount of time can cause small venous gas emboli, which are filtered out in by the lungs and exhaled, causing intravascular abrasion and endothelial injury (Arieli, 2017; Yu et al., 2017; Hess et al., 2021) . These endothelial microinjuries activate various inflammatory responses that could alter the VOC pattern in breath samples, thus obscuring the effects on POT (Mckillop, 2011) .",
