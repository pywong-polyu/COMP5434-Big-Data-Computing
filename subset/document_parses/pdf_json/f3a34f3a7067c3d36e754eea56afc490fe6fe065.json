We hypothesized that placement of a passive peritoneal drain (PPD) can improve postoperative fluid output in such infants. We analyzed 115 consecutive patients, age birth to 60 days, admitted to the PICU after CHS with CPB between 2012 and 2018. Patients who needed postoperative ECMO were excluded. Linear and logistic regression models compared postoperative fluid balances, diuretics administration, AKI, vasoactive-inotropic scores (VIS), time intubated, and length of stay after adjusting for pre/operative predictors including STAT category, bypass time, age, weight, and open chest status. PPD patients had higher STAT category (p = 0.001), longer CPB times (p = 0.001), and higher VIS on POD 1-3 (p \u2264 0.005 daily). PPD patients also had higher AKI rates (p = 0.01) that did not reach significance in multivariable modeling. There were no postoperative deaths. Postoperative hours of intubation, hospital length of stay, and POD 1-5 fluid intake did not differ between groups. Over POD 1-5, PPD use accounted for 48.8 mL/kg increased fluid output (95% CI [2.2, 95.4], p = 0.043) and 3.41 mg/kg less furosemide administered (95% CI [1.69, 5.14], p < 0.001). No PPD complications were observed. Although PPD placement did not affect end-outcomes, it was used in higher acuity patients. PPD placement is associated with improved fluid output despite lower diuretic administration and may be a useful postoperative fluid management adjunct in some complex CHS patients.",

Infants receive proportionally more fluid than older patients relative to their size, increasing their risk of FO. Fluid overload, independent of AKI, is associated with increased length of stay and mortality in neonates undergoing heart surgery [1] . Interestingly, FO in these patients is also associated with worse AKI, likely for multifactorial reasons [1, 2] . Some institutions routinely place peritoneal catheters to manage postoperative FO in neonates and young infants, using either passive peritoneal drainage, peritoneal dialysis, or both [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] .",

Preoperative data included weight, creatinine, presence of chromosomal abnormality or syndrome, age at surgery, sex, history of low birth weight, and history of premature birth.

Patients were not randomized and were selected for PPD placement proactively by the surgical team out of concern for preoperative risk factors that may increase risk of postoperative fluid overload, such as higher STAT score, risk of diastolic dysfunction, and younger age. Single-cuff, 31 cm straight Tenckhoff peritoneal catheters (Covidien, Minneapolis, MN) were placed in the epigastrium and directed to the left pericolic gutter under direct visualization. The peritoneum was closed separately from the drain entrance site. To reduce the possibility of incisional hernia, a 5-0 polypropylene stay suture was pre-placed through the abdominal wall at the stab incision site. The collection bag was connected and kept on the bed. Drains were removed while patients were still intubated and as urine output increased, although there was no absolute volume threshold or protocol for drain removal. The surgical team and approaches remained the same throughout the timeframe examined in this study, and there was no era differentiation. Postoperative care pathways and institutional practices for the management of postoperative CHS patients did not change through the course of the study. Notably, dialysate was not used for these patients; our institution rarely uses peritoneal dialysis postoperatively but has in the case of significant AKI with hyperkalemia, which was not experienced by patients in this cohort.",

Total fluid output included chest and mediastinal drain output. The incidence of AKI within the first ten postoperative days, as determined by the creatinine component of the neonatal modified Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, was determined [10, 11] . KDIGO urine output criteria was not utilized given that it was anticipated that PPD placement would likely be associated with lower urine output. First day with net negative fluid balance was recorded. Daily furosemide dosing per preoperative kilogram weight was tracked over POD 1-5. Chlorothiazide, spironolactone, bumetanide, and hydrochlorothiazide administration were also tracked. We examined several variables to detect physiologic consequences of postoperative fluid overload, including time to chest closure for those with delayed sternal closure, duration of postoperative invasive ventilation (hours), immediate postoperative dynamic respiratory compliance, and daily dynamic respiratory compliance at 7 am. The dynamic respiratory compliance examined was a single value within 60 min of 7 am and the closest value to that time. Additionally, maximum daily vasoactive-inotropic score was calculated through POD 3 [12] . Death within 30 days of surgery, death prior to discharge, STS surgical mortality, and hospital length of stay were noted. Of note, our institution uses an adjustable care model in which the patient stays in the same ICU room until discharge, preventing measurement of ICU length of stay. Total daily diuretic administration was calculated through POD 5.",

This may account for the decreased diuretics given to PPD patients in our study. Although diuretic use is a necessary tool in the armamentarium of congenital heart surgery, it is not without some risks and side effects. Loop diuretic treatment is associated with fluid and electrolyte imbalances including hyponatremia, hypokalemia, and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis, which can depress respiratory drive and delay ventilator weaning. Use of furosemide in preterm infants is also associated with nephrocalcinosis, which itself may lead to glomerular and tubular dysfunction [17] .",

Subjectively, prophylactic PPDs seem to provide an egress mechanism for third-spaced intracorporeal fluid during a time in which it is not otherwise mobilized due to factors including AKI, ongoing capillary leak, and subphysiologic oncotic pressures. Although our current study does not demonstrate endpoint benefit, we hypothesize that PPD may favorably alter fluid management in a subset of high-risk neonate and young infants as they recover from CHS. Specifically, we suspect that PPD may provide more benefit to patients expected to have significant postoperative diastolic dysfunction as opposed to those with complex operations and high risk of AKI but without expected significant diastolic dysfunction. Further studies should evaluate, in randomized fashion, the use of prophylactic passive peritoneal drainage for fluid management after CHS to determine which, if any, patients are most likely to benefit from this approach.",

Patients were not randomized or blinded, and there were not predetermined study protocols for the selection of PPD patients or for the fluid management of either patient group. There was no specific protocol for timing of peritoneal drain removal. PPD patients had higher VIS scores and a trend towards higher rates of stage 2 AKI, and this retrospective work cannot entirely exclude the possibility that PPD presence somehow drives these findings. Treatment bias is a consideration, as it is possible that the decision to administer fluid resuscitation or vasoactive support could be influenced by the presence of a PPD. Analysis of electrolyte supplementation, especially in the setting of reduced diuretic administration, was not achievable given limitations in the data, wide array of postoperative critical illness, and variation in primary nutrition used in our patient cohorts.",

In this comparison across broad and divergent groups of PPD and non-PPD patients, endpoint benefit was not demonstrated. PPD utilization in all infants after CHS is not necessary or advocated by this work, as it is likely that only certain groups of high-risk infants, if any, would benefit. Further evaluation and randomized controlled studies are warranted to determine which, if any, cohorts of high-risk patients would benefit from PPD.",
