Methods Here, to elucidate LINC01140 function, 79 paired LC and paracancerous tissues were collected. LINC01140 expression levels were determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization and qPCR analysis. Cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay and transwell assays were performed. The interaction between microRNAs (miRNAs) and LINC01140 was confirmed using an RNA immunoprecipitation assay. Cytokine-induced killer (CIK) cell phenotypes were analyzed by flow cytometry. Cytokine secretion levels were determined by ELISA. CIK cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring lactate dehydrogenase release. Besides, xenograft tumor mouse models were used to unveil the in vivo function of LINC01140. Results We found that LINC01140 was highly expressed in human LC tissues and cell lines. High LINC01140 levels were associated with poor survival in patients with LC. LINC01140 upregulation promoted the proliferation, migration, and invasion of LC cells through direct interaction with miR-33a-5p and miR-33b-5p, thereby contributing to c-Myc expression and also inhibited cisplatin-induced cell apoptosis. In subcutaneous tumor xenograft mice, LINC01140 knockdown markedly reduced tumor growth and lung metastasis. Additionally, LINC01140 directly repressed miR-377-3 p and miR-155-5 p expression levels, resulting in the upregulation of their common downstream target programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1), a crucial target in LC immunotherapy. Notably, we proved that LINC01140 knockdown, along with CIK administration, suppressed the growth of subcutaneous LC xenografts by decreasing PD-L1 expression in severe combined immunodeficient mice. Conclusions Taken together, LINC01140 overexpression protects c-Myc and PD-L1 mRNA from miRNA-mediated inhibition and contributes to the proliferation, migration, invasion, and immune escape of LC cells. These results provide a theoretical basis that LINC01140 is a promising target for LC treatment.",

[8] [9] [10] [11] [12] LncRNAs exert their biological functions by acting as signaling mediators, molecular decoys, scaffolds, or transcriptional enhancers. 13 Interestingly, many lncRNAs serve as competitive endogenous RNAs that regulate gene expression by sponging microRNAs (miRNAs). For instance, high expression of the lncRNA SNHG1 in LC tissues promotes the progression of NSCLC by reducing miR-101-3 p level and activating the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. 14 Caveolin-1 enhances the proliferation and metastatic potential of LC cells by upregulating the expression of lncRNA HOX transcript antisense RNA (HOTAIR). 15 However, the role played by many lncRNAs in LC development remains unclear.",

We found that LINC01140 expression was greatly upregulated in both lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma tissues compared with adjacent normal samples ( figure 1A ). High LINC01140 expression in LC samples was associated with advanced tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and distant metastases (figure 1B,C). LC patients with a higher level of LINC01140 showed a worse OS, suggesting that LINC01140 promotes LC progression ( figure 1D ). In vitro experiments further indicated that LINC01140 expression was higher in LC cells than in human normal lung epithelial cells ( figure 1E ). The distribution of LINC01140 was measured by extracting RNA from the nucleus and cytoplasm ( figure 1F ) and lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma cells displayed predominantly cytoplasmic LINC01140, which was further validated by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assay ( figure 1G ). Consistently, FISH-targeting LINC01140 revealed that LINC01140 expression was stronger in LC tissues than in non-tumor tissues and was also mostly localized to the cytoplasm (figure 1H,I). Besides, in line with the length (3342 nucleotides) by sequencing (online supplemental figure S1), gel electrophoresis of the qPCR products confirmed that these LINC01140 sequences ranged from 3000 to 5000 nucleotides.",

However, treatment with either the miR-377-3 p or miR-155-5 p inhibitor partially reversed the results induced by LINC01140 knockdown ( figure 6C ). Data further demonstrated that, when tumor cells were cocultured with CIK cells at different ratios (1:10, 1:20, or 1:40) for 24 hours, cell viability was markedly reduced in LINC01140-knockdown LC cells compared with in WT LC cells, and LDH release levels were significantly higher in LINC01140-knockdown LC cells than in WT LC cells, suggestive of a significant decrease in cellular activity. However, miR-377-3 p or miR-155-5 p inhibitor partially reversed the results caused by LINC01140 knockdown in LC cells ( figure 6D ; online supplemental figure S15). Similar results were observed following bright field images and crystal violet staining of adherent cells (online supplemental figure S16A-D).

When the resulting tumors had grown to approximately the same size, the mice received a peritumoral injection of CIK cells. Compared with the control group, the in vivo growth of LINC01140-knockdown LC cell-derived tumors was significantly suppressed following CIK cell injection. Moreover, treatment with miR-377-3 p or miR-155-5 p mimics enhanced the cytotoxicity of CIK cells toward LINC01140-knockdown LC cells ( figure 6E-H) . As miR-377-3P or miR-155-5P mimics did not affect tumor cell proliferation, these effects were likely due to miR-377-3 p or miR-155-5 p-mediated regulation of PD-L1 expression. In support of this possibility, western blotting revealed that LINC01140 knockdown significantly reduced Ki-67, Open access c-Myc, and PD-L1 expression, while further treatment with miR-155-5 p mimics downregulated the expression of PD-L1, but not that of Ki-67 or c-Myc ( figure 6I ). Additionally, LINC01140 knockdown increased the immunohistochemical score for cleaved caspase-3 in xenograft tumor tissues, an effect that was further enhanced by miR-155-5 p mimics treatment (figure 6J), suggesting that CIK cells can induce apoptosis in tumor cells. Importantly, considering that this part of the results was obtained from LC cells with stable knockdown of LINC01140, LINC01140 knockdown caused alterations in cell proliferation and apoptosis as mentioned above. To exclude effects of LINC01140 on tumor progression, we therefore performed experiments using miRNA-377 or miRNA-155 mimics alone following administration with CIK cells in vivo. We found that intratumoral miRNA-377 or miRNA-155 mimics injection had no effect on tumor growth compared with control group. However, further CIK cells transfusion significantly restrained tumor growth. It was accompanied with increased cleaved-caspase-3 protein expression and decreased PD-L1 protein expression in tumor tissues. Biological activities of miRNA-377 or miRNA-155 in LC tissues were confirmed to be independent of cell proliferation (online supplemental figure  S17 ). Collectively, these results showed that miRNA-377 or miRNA-155 was able to increase the killing effect of CIK cells by mediating PD-L1 protein expression in comparison to controls.",

However, it is not clear whether IFN-\u03b3 was from tumor cells or CIK cells. Therefore, the validation experiments in vitro were performed. Control cultures were set up with unstimulated PHA and no measurable levels of IFN-\u03b3 were detected in the culture supernatant of CIK cells. After treatment with stimulating factor PHA, high levels of IFN-\u03b3 were detected in the CIK cell culture supernatant, indicating that our results were credible. To determine the source of IFN-\u03b3, we examined supernatant from cultured tumor cells and found that these samples contained low levels of IFN-\u03b3 but were not significantly different as compared with the blank controls (online supplemental figure S18).

These findings suggested that CIK cells can penetrate xenografted tissues after tumor cell injection.

It mediated the effect of LINC01140/miRNAs axis on LC cell proliferation, migration, and invasion. Notably, it has been proven that c-Myc, a well-known cancer-promoting factor, is significantly upregulated in various cancers, including LC, and is also significantly associated with poor prognosis of patients. 38 39 In our study, c-Myc was confirmed to be one of the common target genes of miR-33a-5p and miR-33b-5p, indicating that LINC01140 could promote LC progression by acting on the miRNAs/c-Myc axis.",

            "text": "PD-L1 is a transmembrane protein that is usually upregulated significantly in cancer cells while serving a primary role in suppressing the immune system by binding to PD-1 on the surface of immune cell membranes. 23 40 There is mounting evidence that upregulated PD-L1 levels are correlated with LC progression and worse prognosis. 24 41 Moreover, several preclinical or clinical studies have demonstrated that patients with LC can benefit from anti-PD-L1 antibody therapy. 42 43 Considering that tumor cells elevate PD-L1 expression through multiple pathways to evade attack by immune system, we detected a significant reduction in PD-L1 expression levels in cells with LINC01140 non-expressed; meanwhile, the responsiveness of tumor cells to CIK cells appeared to be influenced by LINC01140 knockdown as well. Therefore, we conclude that LINC01140 is capable of regulating PD-L1 expression. After performing rescue experiments with each of the 13 miRNAs previously screened, two miRNAs that possibly affected PD-L1 expression were determined, namely miR-377-3 p and miR-155-5 p. Earlier studies have shown that miR-377-3 p 44 45 and miR-155-5 p 46 47 can act as suppressor factors in a wide range of tumors; however, they have not been shown to regulate PD-L1 expression. Our results provide new insights into the tumor suppressor effects of miR-377-3 p and miR-155-5 p. Furthermore, this study indicates that LINC01140/miRNAs/PD-L1 axis-mediated signals suppress the expression levels of cytokines (such as IFN-\u03b3) when cocultured with PBMCderived CIK, implying that high expression of LINC01140 may contribute to the escape of tumor cells from immune system attack. These results support the hypothesis that LINC01140-targeted therapy can not only affect the proliferation, migration, and invasion ability of tumor cells by modulating miRNAs but also prevent from tumor immune escape. Interestingly, previous work in various types of human cancer cells suggested that MYC directly binds to the promoter of PD-L1 gene, and MYC inactivation contributed to a rapid downregulation of PD-L1 at the level of transcription or translation. 48 Therefore, MYC appears to not only promote tumor growth but also drive immune evasion in LC.",

(B) CCK-8 assay showed that downregulation of miR-33a-5p or miR-33b-5p partially reversed the antiproliferative effects of LINC01140 silencing on LC cells. (C) Colony formation experiments confirmed that miR-33a-5p or miR-33b-5p inhibitors partially reversed LINC01140 knockdown-induced colony formation inhibition in LC cells. (D,E) Transwell assays demonstrated that miR-33a-5p or miR-33b-5p inhibitors partially reversed inhibition of cell migration (top panel) and invasion (bottom panel) by LINC01140 knockdown. Scale bar: 100 \u00b5m. (F,G) CCK-8 and colony formation assays showed that LINC01140 knockdown in combination with upregulation of miR-33a-5p or miR-33b-5p had synergistic inhibitory effect on LC cell proliferation. (H) Xenograft mouse model confirmed that LINC01140 silencing inhibited LC cell growth in vivo, and miR-33a-5p or miR-33b-5p mimics could further repress tumor growth. Scale bar: 1 cm. (I) Immunohistochemical experiment revealed that LINC01140 silencing significantly reduced the protein level of PHH3 and Ki-67 in tumor tissues from the xenograft models (n=6 mice per group) and miR-33a-5p or miR-33b-5p mimics further downregulated their expression levels. Scale bar: 100 \u00b5m.(J) H&E staining demonstrated that LINC01140 silencing reduced the number of tumor nodules in lung metastasis models and miR-33a-5p or miR-33b-5p mimics further suppress lung metastasis in nude mice.
