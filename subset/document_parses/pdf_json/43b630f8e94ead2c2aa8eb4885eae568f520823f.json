Basic hygiene interventions such as handwashing with water and soap (HWWS) when applied consistently will deactivate and remove the virus particles from the hands. Realizing the efforts that have been made by countries world over in controlling the COVID-19, this letter seeks to discuss how the available WASH services can be used in the fight against further spread of COVID-19. The letter highlights the challenges being faced by the current WASH services in middle-and low-income countries and suggests measures that can be employed to strengthen the WASH services in this period of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This intervention has been used as one of the silent weapons in WASH interventions to mitigate transmission of the diseases, and it has been proven to be effective in reducing transmission and disease risk especially during the infectious outbreak [12] . Furthermore, HWWS has shown to be a feasible and cost-effective mechanism to prevent infectious outbreaks [12] . Some studies have shown that HWWS can decrease the level of microorganisms close to zero and can also reduce the risk of respiratory infections by 23% [13, 14] . The existing WASH platform can be used to support the implementation of COVID-19 preventive measures, but there are challenges that are being faced by the existing WASH platform in middle-and low-income countries. These include the inadequate availability of water services, lack of basic handwashing facilities, and lack of knowledge and awareness of proper hand hygiene practices such as critical moments for handwashing, proper steps of handwashing, adequate time of handwashing, and the benefits of proper handwashing [15, 16] . Globally, it is estimated that 3 billion people do not have access to most basic handwashing facilities at home and about 43% of the health facilities lack hand hygiene at the point of care [16] .",

In order to ensure sustainable behavioral change, efforts should be made by the government to encourage communities to adopt new behaviors; this can be done through mass education, social marketing, and community mobilization. In counties where the COVID-19 already exists, efforts should be made to ensure that all the current WASH interventions are expanded to reach communities where such services are non-existent. Further, we think that there is a need to ensure constant water supply is made available to enable regular and frequent handwashing. The governments, world over, should raise awareness of their communities on the importance of adhering to basic hygiene and sanitation practices regularly and distribute hygienic kits/ soap in areas where some communities cannot afford them.",
