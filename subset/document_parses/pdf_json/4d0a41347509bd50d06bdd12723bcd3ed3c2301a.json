South Africa, like many other countries, initiated a multifaceted national response to the pandemic. Self-isolation and quarantine are essential components of the public health response in the country. This paper examined perceptions and preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine during the initial phase of the pandemic in South Africa. Methods: The analysis used data obtained from an online quantitative survey conducted in all nine provinces using a data-free platform. Descriptive statistics and multivariable logistic regression models were used to analyse the data. Results: Of 55,823 respondents, 40.1% reported that they may end up in self-isolation or quarantine, 32.6% did not think that they would and 27.4% were unsure. Preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine was 59.0% for self, 53.8% for child and 59.9% for elderly. The odds of perceived possibility for self-isolation or quarantine were significantly higher among Coloureds, Whites, and Indians/Asians than Black Africans, and among those with moderate or high self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 than those with low risk perception. The odds were significantly lower among older age groups than those aged 18-29 years, and those unemployed than fully employed. The odds of preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine were significantly less likely among females than males. Preparedness for self, child and elderly isolation or quarantine was significantly more likely among other population groups than Black Africans and among older age groups than those aged 18-29 years. Preparedness for self, child and elderly isolation or quarantine was significantly less likely among those self-employed than fully employed and those residing in informal dwellings than formal dwellings. In addition, preparedness for selfisolation or quarantine was significantly less likely among those with moderate and high self-perceived risk of contracting COVID-19 than low risk perception.",

These interventions include social approaches such as quarantine, isolation and lockdown. Quarantine refers to the restriction of movement of people who may have been exposed to a contagious disease or were in contact with an infected person, and is the oldest containment strategy [10] . Isolation refers to the separation of people who are known to be infected with a contagious disease from those who are uninfected in order to limit viral shedding and thereby control the spread of the disease [11] . Lockdown or community containment is a full mandatory quarantine or non-mandatory \"stay at home order\" whereby events and businesses are halted, and the public are requested to remain at home in an effort to restrict mass gatherings and thereby restrict viral transmission [12] .",

For example, during the SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome and Ebola outbreaks, public health measures, such as quarantine and isolation, were also rigorously implemented to disrupt human-tohuman transmission and to strengthen control measures [15, 16] . In most instances the intensive quarantine and isolation measures curbed further transmission [16, 17] . While quarantine and isolation orders during the Ebola outbreak led to challenges in access to food, water and sanitation, they proved successful in reducing disease transmission [18] .",

The online survey was conducted from 27 March 2020 to 2 April 2020, which coincided with the first 7 days of the lockdown period for COVID-19. All adults (18 years and older) residing in South Africa, regardless of race, sex or nationality were eligible to participate. Location in South Africa was restricted by internet protocol address to ensure that only residents in South Africa could complete the survey.",

Descriptive statistics (frequencies and percentages) were used to summarize the primary outcome measures by sociodemographic characteristics. Pearson's chi-square test was used to compare differences between categorical variables. Multivariable logistic regression models were fitted to determine the factors associated with 1) perceptions for self-isolation or quarantine possibility and 2) preparedness for each of self-isolation or quarantine, child-isolation or quarantine and elderly-isolation or quarantine.

This paper examined perceptions and preparedness for self-isolation or quarantine and preparations for lockdown during the initial phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in South Africa. Overall, our findings demonstrate varied realities and readiness for isolation, quarantine and lockdown among South African residents, which varied by age, race, locality and other socio-economic factors. Self-isolation has also been previously shown to be directly impacted by socio-economic status, age, education and whether or not families have to care for vulnerable individuals like children or the elderly [29] . Additionally, these findings show that more than half of the respondents were prepared for self-isolation, child-isolation and the isolation of the elderly. Similarly, in a study conducted in Israel, a self-isolation compliance rate of less than 57% was reported from an online survey [30] . It is noteworthy to indicate that respondents living in informal dwelling settlements were the least prepared for isolation and quarantine mostly due to the stark inequalities of the South African society and with no space available for this in poor households.",

The race disparities may be due to knowledge and awareness differences about the COVID-19 pandemic between other race groups and Black Africans. Surprisingly, older citizens (30 years and older) who are more vulnerable to contracting COVID-19, were less likely to think they might end up in self-isolation or quarantine compared to their younger counterparts. Those who were unemployed were less likely to think they might end up in selfisolation or quarantine compared to those employed in full time jobs. This may be attributed to the fact that initially, COVID-19 was perceived to be associated with international travel, of which the unemployed are not exposed to. The COVID-19 virus was therefore initially seen as the virus that attacks middle or working class and wealthy South Africans as they are the ones that normally travel abroad. This highlights the importance of communicating factual and rational information about COVID-19 in order to foster a positive social climate for communities to endorse healthy habits and to comply with the recommended preventive health behaviours.",

These differences based on gender may be an indication of the disparities in terms of resources between male headed households when compared to female headed households. On the contrary, there were no gender differences when it came to individual readiness for self-isolation [29] .

Those aged 40 years and above were more likely to be prepared to self-isolate, and separate children and the elderly from the rest of the family than those aged 18-29 years. Age has also been previously found to be a predictor of selfisolation readiness during a pandemic [29] . The odds of being prepared to self-isolate, or to separate children and the elderly from the rest of the family were higher among other race groups when compared to Black Africans. The likely reason for this could be that the Apartheid policies afforded Coloured, White and Indian/ Asian sub-population groups more socio economic benefits in terms of housing, education and general wellbeing [31] . The socio-economic inequalities in South Africa are often visible across racial lines due to the historical legacies of legalized racial segregation [31] [32] [33] . When comparing employment status, this study found significant differences between the five employment categories for all three isolation scenarios. Zhang et al. [28] also reported significant association between socioeconomic status and preparedness for self-isolation. Self-employed residents showed the highest preparedness for all three forms of isolation when compared with people who are in employment which is to be expected as they have more personal control of their time. Those employed informally or part time were less likely to be prepared for child-isolation and elderly-isolation than those employed full time. On the contrary, a study in Israel found that self-employed individuals were reportedly more prone to refuse self-quarantine measures when compensation was removed, which emphasizes that socio-economic conditions and survival play a big role in the decision to comply with regulations [30] .",

This further indicated South Africans' preparedness for lockdown but was also a clear demonstration of how socioeconomic status can have an impact on how one would experience a national lockdown. The implications of the COVID-19 outbreak on the global economy and health care infrastructure mean that existing policies need to be reviewed to help mitigate the current crisis. The South African government had no choice but to institute a mandatory nationwide lockdown and forced the closure of businesses deemed as non-essential services [21] . The most immediate consequences of the lockdown included loss of income for businesses, loss of employment across multiple sectors and loss of tax revenue. The government should therefore concentrate on reducing the spread of the virus and channelling monetary relief towards the most vulnerable, including small and medium-size enterprises, households and informal workers [37, 38] . Although these measures can offer temporary relief, more long-term avenues need to be considered. For example, women constitute a subgroup of the vulnerable because they are at an increased risk of infection from COVID-19. This is largely due to women being the main caregivers in their communities, homes and health facilities [39] . Protection measures against increased exposure among vulnerable groups should be considered when designing health care infrastructure post COVID-19.",
