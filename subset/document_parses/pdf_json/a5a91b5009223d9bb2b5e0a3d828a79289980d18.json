            "text": "This study presents an efficient solution for the integrated recovery room planning and scheduling problem (IRRPSP). The complexity of the IRRPSP is caused by several sources. The problem combines the assignment of patients to recovery rooms and the scheduling of caregivers over a short-term planning horizon. Moreover, a solution of the IRRPSP should respect a set of hard and soft constraints while solving the main problem such as the maximum capacity of recovery rooms, the maximum daily load of caregivers, the treatment deadlines, etc. Thus, the need for an automated tool to support the decision-makers in handling the planning and scheduling tasks arises. In this paper, we present an exhaustive description of the epidemiological situation within the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, especially in Jeddah Governorate. We will highlight the importance of implementing a formal and systematic approach in dealing with the scheduling of recovery rooms during extreme emergency periods like the COVID-19 era. To do so, we developed a mathematical programming model to present the IRRPSP in a formal way which will help in analyzing the problem and lately use its solution for comparison and evaluation of our proposed approach. Due to the NP-hard nature of the IRRPSP, we propose a hybrid three-level approach. This study uses real data instances received from the Department of Respiratory and Chest Diseases of the King Abdulaziz Hospital. The computational results show that our solution significantly outperforms the results obtained by CPLEX software with more than 1.33% of satisfied patients on B1 benchmark in much lesser computation time (36.27 to 1546.79 s). Moreover, our proposed approach can properly balance the available nurses and the patient perspectives.",

In their study, the authors developed a decision support system (DSS) that helps hospitals in generating balanced shifts for both regular and COVID-19 workloads. To model the shift scheduling problem, the authors presented a mixed integer programming which was subsequently solved using Gurobi software. According to the authors, the proposed DSS is able to generate schedules for physicians in a very short time. The scheduling of the staff is distributed evenly and the duration of exposure to the virus is reduced. However, we can remark that the main limitation of this work is to not solve the problem using a powerful algorithm (heuristic or a metaheuristic algorithm) since it will not be possible to optimally solve the problem if the number of patients blow up and the problem becomes complicated.",

According to the authors, the computational results on generated (artificial) instances indicate that their approach has an average optimality gap of 2.81% and significantly outperforms a compact mathematical formulation used in similar research.

To do so, the authors modeled the considered problem using a stochastic model, which was solved using a sample average approximation technique that uses a limited number of scenarios. To prove the efficiency of the proposed approach, the authors executed a set of tests on a real case study with real data from a leading European children's hospital. The computational study shows that it is fundamental to consider the stochastic nature of the problem for both the lengths of stay and the surgery times.

To model the problem, the authors proposed a comprehensive multiobjective programming model that aims to ensure three objectives, which are the minimization of the total cost, the maximization of the patients' satisfaction, and the maximization of the aggregation of compatibilities of the surgical teams. The authors developed two metaheuristics which are the NSGA-II and the MOPSO to find Pareto solutions. Furthermore, the PROMETHEE-II method was used to select the best among the obtained Pareto solutions. According to the authors, the results generated by MOPSO indicate better performance compared to NSGA-II. It is important to mention here that the resulting schedule is limited since it is a short-horizon schedule (daily). Thus, it is inconsistent to validate the proposed approach using a daily schedule. It requires extending the approach to be able to define a weekly or semi-monthly schedule that can be used for evaluating the approach efficiency.",

To model the studied problem, the authors presented a stochastic mixed-integer mathematical formulation that aims to improve the assignment of surgeries and to minimize the total overtime that exceeds the available time durations for surgeries. To solve the proposed model, the authors suggested three solving methods, which are (i) a Tabu Search metaheuristic (TS), (ii) a fastest ascent local search, and (iii) the sample average approximation method. The experimental study shows that the TS metaheuristic provides effective solutions within reasonable computation times. This interpretation was not justified by the authors to detail the main reasons that make the TS suitable to solve the studied problem than other solving techniques.",

The topic has been extensively investigated which highlights its importance to the patients and hospitals by realizing both health and cost-efficiency objectives. In this context, the experiments of each paper show an improvement on both operating rooms capacity filling and supplementary hours overruns limitation. Multiple decision support tools have been developed to assist managers in taking better and optimal assignment and scheduling decisions. In addition, multiple works in the literature show that developing decision tools presented strategies in developed countries' hospitals could help them limit their healthcare budget overruns. On the other hand, the contribution of this paper is twofold. First, we consider the patient assignment and scheduling problem during the COVID-19 pandemic, which is, to the best of our knowledge, not yet addressed in the literature, and this is the first attempt to solve it. Second, we present a threelevel hybrid algorithm to solve the integrated recovery room planning and scheduling problem. By the end, the experimental study shows that the suggested methodology realizes (near-)optimal solutions and outperforms the CPLEX software solution.",

The second category is composed of cases from middle to moderate state which requires to treat symptoms and having to follow instructions and recommendations published by the Saudi Ministry of Health. The third category consists of severe cases that must be admitted to the hospital and treated by caregivers in the Intensive Care Unit. The last category contains the critical case patients who are also called to be admitted to the hospital with more intensive care. In the following table, we give more details about each category. In our context, we will consider only the third and the fourth categories since they must be admitted to the hospitals. At a daily meeting of the medical staff, the state of patients is discussed to decide and many scenarios are possible. They start by checking if the patient is new or not. If he is a previous patient, then they check if there is \"any change\" from his previous state; if yes, they will do another check to precise if they have to consider him as a critical or a severe patient. On the other hand, if the patient is new, the medical staff will directly do the second check. The following flowchart (see Fig. 1 ) summarizes all possible states.",

These types of resources are used mainly by two types of recovery room schedules which are considered in the hospitals. The first type treats the severe patients without considering the critical cases; thus, rooms contain only recovery beds and are designed in our work as Recovery Beds Rooms (RBR). The other one treats the critical cases using special respiratory machines and this type of room is designed in our work as Recovery Respiratory Rooms (RRR). After assigning patients to rooms, the set of caregivers must be scheduled based on the type of required care.

In our case, we generate a random initial solution by randomly combining the set of visits.

In this context, [5] defines a near-optimal solution as \"a feasible solution with an objective function value within a specified range from the (usually unknown) optimal objective function value.\" To do so, we provide in the following two Tables 14  and 15 , two statistical tests to analyze and compare the CPU time used by our proposed approach compared to the CPLEX solution on both benchmarks B1 and B2.",

To answer this urgent concern of healthcare providers, the IRRPSP is defined and then solved by decomposing it into two sub-problems which are solved in three sequential phases. In the first step, the method search to assign patients to the recovery rooms while respecting both types of patients and recovery rooms. The method, therefore, seeks to assign nurses to patients. In this second step, we used the overtime resources in order to maximize nurses' utilization while minimizing the number of unsatisfied patients. The hybrid algorithm developed combines neighborhood search techniques with the Tabu Search metaheuristic, which is used to optimize the number of satisfied patients. The proposed approaches have been explained, justified, and illustrated with synthetic and pedagogical figures and diagrams. Then, they have been programmed and tested on a set of real data that have been constructed. The reported results mainly achieved objective function levels and the needed computational time shows the efficiency and the robustness of the solutions produced. Two main and significant outcomes of this work are to point out, from our standpoint. The first is the tackling of such interesting subjects especially there are no sufficient works that try to develop solutions to COVID-19 pandemic problems. Moreover, with the increasing challenges faced by the health sector especially during the COVID-19 virus, this topic gets more and more important and needs to be addressed and solved.",

In the first direction, we are particularly interested in computing the strategies developed in this paper with bigger data instances. The second direction in which we are interested is to continue our research work based on these promising results is to implement more sophisticated heuristical algorithms, relying on the proposed pattern decomposition. The third perspective consists of transforming the proposed three-level hybrid algorithm into a real-life scenario by applying it to a practical case for one of Jeddah hospitals. The main steps of this scenario can be captured in Fig. 2 , in which the first task consists of assigning the patients to the recovery rooms then the second task takes the output of the previous task as an input to define the nurses' assignments to patients. A third step of the scenario consists of improving the obtained solution of the second step by minimizing the set of unsatisfied tasks. This can be done by (i) profiting from the available overtime of the nurses and (ii) by maximizing the recovery room utilization. ",
