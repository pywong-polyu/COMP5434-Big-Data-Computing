Prevention and mitigation strategies have included closure of schools, churches, and businesses, as well as bans on gatherings and quarantine for test positives. Such social distancing is assumed to contribute to suicide to the extent that it reduces social interaction and support (Gunnell et al., 2020; Reger et al., 2020; Wasserman, 1992) . There have been investigations reporting links between the number of influenza deaths in the 1918 Spanish influenza pandemic and the national suicide rate (Wasserman, 1992) and also the SARS epidemic to a spike in the Hong Kong suicide rate in April 2003 (Cheung et al., 2008) . Given the absence of measures on social distancing, these investigations used the mortality rate from influenza as a proxy measure of social distancing. No previous study has assessed the association between the degree of actual social distancing and suicide rates. The present study addresses this gap in the literature. The types of social distancing, which are occurring in the COVID-19 pandemic, closely resemble those employed in the 1918 influenza pandemic (Correia et al., 2020) . Specifically, the present investigation assesses the association between degree of social distancing and suicide rates in 43 large US cities during that pandemic. Our central hypothesis is that suicide rates in those cities varied positively with the degree of social distancing.",

Previous analyses of the suicide data during the 1910-1920 period have counseled caution in interpreting their findings since the death registration area (DRA) was expanding during that time (Stack, 1988; Wasserman, 1992) . However, this is not an issue in the present analysis since it employs data on suicide for only one year, 1918-holding the DRA constant. An overtime reliability test-retest of the data yielded significant correlations, wherein the 1917 suicide rates in cities were significant predictors of their 1918 suicide rates (r = 0.703, p = 0.000). We could not evaluate heterogeneity in suicide registration and the quality/nature of medicolegal death investigations across study cities. This is an issue for future research.",

Prevailing distancing policies comprised three categories: (1) public school (grade school through high school) closures by city officials; (2) public gathering bans (e.g., closure of saloons and cancelation of sporting events and parades); and (3) mandatory quarantine of persons suspected of having had contact with ill persons. Markel et al.'s (2007) index operationalized distancing in terms of the total number of cumulative days of social distancing interventions implemented for the three major categories. Cumulative days ranged from 33 in Newark, New Jersey, to 170 in Kansas City, Missouri. The data on social distancing are considered valid and reliable and have been used in studies of the impact of social distancing on the rate of mortality from influenza (e.g., Correia et al., 2020) .",

In 2020, the nuclear family predominates, and a higher proportion of people live alone than in 1918, a confluence of social and physical isolation that predictably increases suicide susceptibility and consequently rates, in concert with COVID-19 social distancing policy (Reger et al., 2020) . This joint impact may be psychologically offset, in whole or part, by the ongoing communications revolution, which embraces social media, cell phones, and streaming video -technology unavailable in 1918. On the other hand, variable economic hardship will plausibly impinge on the relative utilization of this technology.
