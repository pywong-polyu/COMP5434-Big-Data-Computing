Furthermore, governments are responsible for safeguarding links in the abortion supply chain, from registration to distribution of abortion drugs and supplies. Strategic public-private partnerships and use of innovative local or community-based distribution mechanisms can strengthen supply chain systems. Finally, alternatives to the pull-based models of distribution could alleviate bottlenecks in the final steps of abortion supply chains. Programs aimed at increasing access to safe and comprehensive abortion care must include SCM as a foundational component of service provision. Without access to a sustainable and affordable supply of abortion drugs and equipment, any attempt at providing abortion services will be critically limited. More implementation research is needed to identify the most effective interventions for improving SCM.",

While abortion is restricted in many settings around the world, only 6% of women live in countries where there are no legal indications for the procedure [2, 3] . As such, reducing the burden of unsafe abortion rests considerably on women's ability to access appropriate and timely treatment or services. A critical component of that care relies on a functional supply chain to ensure availability of abortion drugs and supplies within the health system. It is particularly important that abortion drugs and supplies be readily available at the point of care in settings where there are gestational age limits on legal abortion or where women delay seeking abortion care due to stigma or other barriers. Disruptions in the supply of medical abortion drugs such a misoprostol or mifepristone, manual vacuum aspiration (MVA) kits or other key medicines such as analgesics and antibiotics delay provision of abortion services and can increase the risks to a woman's health [4] .",

Providers in Malawi and Cameroon faced significant declines in MVA kit availability following initial training or piloting of interventions due to a lack of follow-up funding and capacity for supply management, forcing a reversion to use of dilation and curettage, a practice associated with greater rates of maternal morbidity and pain [14, 15] . In some contexts, providers report re-using MVA supplies well past what is recommended, with unknown safety implications. As such, initial gains in MVA training and services, particularly at the lowest levels of the health system often diminish due to a lack of affordable MVA kits [16] . A struggling supply chain not only affects sustainability of abortion services but can also limit the capacity of programs to expand their services. Abortion providers in China and Vietnam both identified issues with drug and equipment supplies as one of the main barriers to expansion of medical abortion services [17, 18] . In Guatemala and Kyrgyzstan, the success of medical abortion and postabortion care (PAC) training and service delivery programs depended heavily on continued availability of MVA kits and strengthening of procurement and distribution systems to prevent MA drug stock-outs [19, 20] .",

Governments play an important role in identifying appropriate manufacturers of misoprostol, negotiating beneficial procurement terms with manufacturers and creating oversight mechanisms for quality assurance which includes specific government budget line items for quality assurance testing. An assessment of the introduction of medical abortion in Vietnam showed that the single-most urgent action needed from the government for sustainable abortion services, after registering mifepristone in 2003, was to ensure a steady, affordable supply of abortion drugs, which included negotiating lower prices for medical abortion drugs both with local producers and international distributors [24] . The Ghanaian government's initiative to add MVA kits to the national List of Essential Medicines & Supplies contributed significantly to their MVA scaleup effort [16] . On the other hand, the government policy of administrative approval for all commodity purchases in public facilities across Ghana created a cumbersome procurement process that limits efficient acquisition of abortion supplies [16] .

Daff et al. devised an alternative \"informed push model\" of contraceptive commodity management in Senegal that engages dedicated logisticians at the district level to maintain up-to-date stock records, sell commodities on a consignment basis, and stock at least two months of supplies per facility at all times. Although initially time and resource-intensive, the development of a sustainable distribution system at the local level led to drastic reductions in contraceptive commodity stockouts in Senegal [11] . At the very least, programs that work to increase access to safe abortion should include supply system strengthening as part of their intervention.",

The lack of any peer-reviewed or grey literature articles testing interventions to improve abortion SCM, despite its importance in delivering quality abortion care, demonstrates a significant dearth of attention on abortion SCM in the reproductive health and rights field. Providers repeatedly point to supply chain barriers as one of the primary challenges to abortion service provision, yet few abortion service training programs directly address SCM. Abortion supplies may be subject to additional legal and social barriers that limit their availability within traditional supply chain systems, further highlighting the importance of additional research in this area. Furthermore, none of these programs evaluate the unique challenges of ensuring a robust supply chain for quality abortion drugs and equipment. Evidence from such studies could greatly facilitate the planning and development of effective SCM interventions for abortion service delivery programs.",

Research is needed to identify interventions which meaningfully improve supply chain systems for abortion commodities as well as their effect on women's health outcomes to fully understand the impact of SCM on safe abortion care. Such evidence could be used to rally governments and strategic partners around interventions to strengthen supply chain systems, and to advocate for inclusion of SCM interventions within abortion programming.",

Delays in production and export for distribution of abortion medication and supplies from counties which closed their borders during the pandemic highlight upstream issues in manufacturing that will require more widespread effort in our field to address. However, the pandemic has also encouraged significant innovation, particularly through telemedicine and mailing of abortion drugs, which has helped ensure access during the crisis. How we respond to emerging issues today may offer additional reproductive health choices, or may even expand access to some women and girls, moving forward beyond the pandemic.",
