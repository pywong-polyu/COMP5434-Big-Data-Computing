Here, SEI 1 I 2 R model describes the effect of asymptomatic and symptomatic transmissions on coronavirus disease outbreak. The existence and uniqueness of the solution are studied with the help of Schaeferand Banach-type fixed point theorems. Sensitivity analysis of the model in terms of the variance of each parameter is examined, and the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) to discuss the local stability at two equilibrium points is proposed. Using the Routh-Hurwitz criterion of stability, it is found that the disease-free equilibrium will be stable for R 0 < 1 whereas the endemic equilibrium becomes stable for R 0 > 1 and unstable otherwise. Moreover, the numerical simulations for various values of fractional-order are carried out with the help of the fractional Euler method. The numerical results show that asymptomatic transmission has a lower impact on the disease outbreak rather than symptomatic transmission. Finally, the simulated graph of total infected population by proposed model here is compared with the real data of second-wave infected population of COVID-19 outbreak in India. 0123456789().: V,-vol Eur.

Interestingly, it has been observed that individuals who take all precautionary measures are occasionally infected, making it necessary to investigate the facts in human-to-human transmission processes. Even though nothing is known clinically about the COVID-19 transmission pathway, numerous compartmental models offer simulation graphs that are quite similar to statistical data. In most situations, asymptomatic people are excluded from the COVID-19 diagnostic test and play a substantial role in the disease's transmission. There have also been several reports of other diseases' deaths yet later tested positive with COVID-19. Because COVID-19 is a lot more infectious disease than being deadly, a massive proportion of the population eventually becomes a carrier. To address all of these factors, no mathematical model for parallel disease transmission has been developed on COVID-19, and hence a mathematical model for symptomatic and asymptomatic disease transmission at the same time is required. Consequently, the goal of this research is to provide a mathematical model for controlling the COVID-19 epidemic. The new mathematical model, known as SEI 1 I 2 R model, considers two parallel paths for symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission throughout the exposed compartment. The model examines the COVID-19 outbreak's asymptomatic transmission impact as well as the sensitivity of the parameters affecting the pandemic. The function representing the disease's transmission mechanism, known as the force of infection or incidence rate, plays a crucial role in SIR, SEIR, and similar models. Typically, such a function is dependent on both the susceptible and infective classes, for example f (S, I). The incidence rate can be expressed in a simple way using the mass action principle: If \u03bc is the per capita contact rate, then the infection is assumed to spread with the rate f (S, I) = \u03bcSI. Capasso and his colleagues [18] have emphasized the need to consider nonlinear incidence rates for some specific diseases since the 1970s: The studied example was the spread of cholera epidemic. Many researchers have suggested different nonlinear forms for the incidence rate since then, see [19] . The functional f (S, I) = \u03bcSI(1 + \u03bbI) is an excellent example of the nonlinear incidence rate, where the constants \u03bc and \u03bb are both positive. It refers to a higher infection rate over a short period, which is caused by two exposures. The contact rate \u03bcSI is the result of single contact, while the term \u03bc\u03bbI 2 S refers to a new infective that arises as a result of the double exposure [20] . The readers may see more detail about incident rate in [21] . The reason for choosing the convex incident rate is because this function could model the increase in infection resulting from the situation of double exposure. This is in line with the unknown disease mechanisms of a COVID-19 pandemic studied in [22] .",

            "text": "Over the last three decades, fractional derivatives have fascinated many researchers due to the recognition that, compared to classical derivatives, fractional derivatives are more efficient tools for modeling real-world phenomena. Fractional calculus (FC)-based modeling is becoming increasingly popular in dynamic situations. The fractional-order differential operators such as Riemann-Liouville (R-L) [23], Caputo [24], Erd\u00e9lyi-Kober [25], Hilfer [26], Hadamard [27], Katugampola [28], Caputo-Fabrizio [29], and Atangana-Baleanu [30] change the ordinary model into a generalized model. This paper presents new research on a fractional-order dynamical model that underpins the spread of coronavirus infectious disease and can be used to predict its spread. So, in this manuscript, we develop a new mathematical model for COVID-19 outbreak and extend it to a fractional-order model by adding the Caputo sense of fractional derivative. The reason for utilizing the Caputo fractional derivative is that it possesses several fundamental characteristics of FC. Furthermore, the Caputo operator may be useful to further specify the transmission behavior given in the model. Several previous investigations have found the reliability of the Caputo operator and their applicability to diverse the models arising in numerous areas of engineering and other sciences. A few related studies on Caputo and other fractional-order derivative can be found in the literature, for example physics and polymer technology [31], electrical circuits [32], electrochemistry [33], electrodynamics of complex medium [34], fluid mechanics [35], control theory [36], thermodynamics [37], neural network [38], image encryption [39], chaos [40], viscoelasticity [41], aerodynamics [42], capacitor theory [43], biology [44], blood flow [45], and the references cited therein. Besides, nowadays the researchers are devoting their research work to the fractional-order COVID-19 mathematical models. A huge number of good research papers related to fractional-order COVID-19 mathematical models can be found in the literature, some of them are the following: Caputo fractional-order [46,47], Caputo-Fabrizio fractional-order [48,49], Atangana-Baleanu fractional-order [50,51], fuzzy fractional-order [52,53], fractal-fractional order [54,55].",

The researchers gain valuable information for several contagious diseases by studying stochastic and deterministic models. Kermack and McKendrick (1927) created a helpful model for executing and growing complex epidemic models, now regarded as a fundamental model in an epidemiology study [1] . Many infectious diseases can transmit in both vertical and horizontal paths. HIV/AIDS, Herpes Simplex, Hepatitis B, and Rubella are a few examples of such infections. These diseases are horizontally transmitted in people and animals by host-to-host interaction or disease carriers such as flies, mosquitoes, and others.

The new virus (2019-nCoV), which is highly transmissible and virulent, was identified in a single individual in the Chinese city of Wuhan [10] . This new disease, which produces a severe acute respiratory syndrome, has spread throughout the world. There have been over 253 million confirmed COVID-19 registered cases, and over 5.1 million fatalities globally since November 10, 2021 [11] . America, Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia, the Western Pacific, the Eastern Pacific, and the Mediterranean are the most effected by the coronavirus. The first signs of a COVID-19 infection include a dry cough, fever, exhaustion, and shortness of breath, which develop in 2-10 days and can lead to pneumonia, SARS, kidney failure, and even death [12] . The pandemic continued to expand, but vaccinations have now halted the transmission. Many researchers have been developed mathematical models for the transmission of the aforesaid disease involves various compartments, for example Susceptible-Infected (SI) [13] , SI-Removed (SIR) [14] , S-Exposed-IR (SEIR) [15] , SEI-Quarantined-R (SEIQR) [16] , and SIQ-Home Quarantined-R-Diseased (SIQHRD) [17] .",

As a result, non-pharmaceutical measures such as isolation, social distance, quarantine, awareness programs, developed an SEI 1 I 2 R model for COVID-19 disease transmission, in which the population is divided into five classes: susceptible S, exposed E, asymptomatic infected I 1 , symptomatic infected I 2 , and recovered or removed R. The model assumes the total population N is not constant throughout the time and equal to the sum of all compartment sizes at any time t, i.e., N = S + E + I 1 + I 2 + R. We made the following assumptions to formulate the model: Asymptomatic transmission is represented by the primary pathway SEI 1 R, in which asymptomatic infected individuals spread the disease at a rate of \u03bc 1 . The SEI 2 R is the second pathway that denotes indicative transmission, in which symptomatic individuals transmit the infection at a rate of \u03bc 2 . The symptomatic case's transmission rate \u03bc 2 and infection rates \u03c1 2 are considered to be higher than the asymptomatic case's, i.e., \u03bc 2 > \u03bc 1 and \u03c1 2 > \u03c1 1 . Asymptomatic patients have a higher recovery rate than symptomatic patients (\u03b2 1 > \u03b2 2 ), and asymptomatic patients have a lower mortality rate (\u03b1 2 > \u03b1 1 ) than symptomatic patients. is the recruitment rate, representing the increment of compartment S in the form of birth or migration or recovered individuals. The natural death rate \u03b1 is equal to the recruiting rate into compartment S. In this study death population due to the COVID-19 infection is only counted.",

The quantities \u03bc 1 S I 1 N and \u03bc 2 S I 2 N in the first equation represent the interaction of susceptible individuals with asymptomatic and symptomatic infectious peoples with \u03bc 1 and \u03bc 2 rates, respectively. As can be seen in the second equation, these interactions increase the number of people who are exposed. The terms \u03c1 1 E and \u03c1 2 E denote the number of people becoming infected via the exposure of susceptible people. In the third equation, \u03b1 1 I 1 and \u03b2 1 I 1 show the number of death and recovered population in the asymptomatic class.

Figure 3a describes the reproduction number R 0 sensitivity versus the asymptomatic transmission rate \u03bc 1 and asymptomatic death rate \u03b1 1 . Since from Table 2 , it is clear that \u03bc 1 has a positive impact while \u03b1 1 has a negative impact on reproduction number R 0 . So, it can be seen in Fig. 3a the asymptomatic death rate has no impact on R 0 because no variation can be seen in R 0 when \u03b1 1 increases. On another side, the asymptomatic transmission rate \u03bc 1 has a very high impact on R 0 . Figure 3b describes the reproduction number R 0 sensitivity versus symptomatic infection rate \u22120.55385 \u03c1 2 and asymptomatic transmission rate \u03bc 1 . So it can be seen in Table 2 that both parameters has a positive impact on reproduction number R 0 . But the impact of asymptomatic transmission rate is higher than the symptomatic infection rate, which is depicted in Fig. 3b . Figure 3c shows the reproduction number R 0 sensitivity versus the symptomatic transmission rate \u03bc 2 and asymptomatic death rate \u03b1 1 . The impact of the symptomatic transmission rate is positive on the reproduction number, while the impact of the asymptomatic death rate is negative. The impact of asymptomatic death rate is almost negligible, but the effect of the symptomatic transmission rate is quite high enough where can be seen in Fig. 3c . Figure 3d shows the reproduction number R 0 sensitivity versus asymptomatic (a) (b) (c) (d) Fig. 4 The solution behavior of the all compartments for various values of \u03b8 recovery rate \u03b2 1 and symptomatic recovery rate \u03b2 2 . Both parameters have a negative impact on the reproduction number R 0 (see Table 2 ), but the affect is almost the same, which is shown in Fig. 3d . Figure 3e demonstrates the reproduction number R 0 sensitivity versus the asymptomatic transmission rate \u03bc 1 and symptomatic recovery rate \u03b2 2 . The transmission rate \u03bc 1 of the asymptomatic pathway has a positive impact on reproduction number R 0 and symptomatic recovery rate \u03b2 2 has a negative impact on R 0 , which can be seen in Table 2 . From Fig. 3e , we can conclude that the symptomatic transmission rate \u03bc 1 effects the reproduction number more than the symptomatic recovery rate \u03b2 2 . Figure 3f describes the reproduction number R 0 sensitivity versus symptomatic death rate \u03b1 2 and symptomatic recovery rate \u03b2 2 . Both parameters have a negative impact on reproduction number R 0 . But the impact is almost the same, which is shown in Fig. 3f . Now we discuss the numerical results of the governing model in terms of approximate solutions. To achieve this goal, we used the efficient fractional-order Euler technique with the Caputo fractional operator. The initial conditions are considered as S(0) = 1 \u2212 E(0) \u2212 I 1 (0) \u2212 I 2 (0) \u2212 R(0), E(0) = 5/20000, I 1 (0) = 0, I 2 (0) = 0, R(0) = 0 with the total population N = 1 and the values of the parameter are given in Table 1 . We have utilized the MATLAB software to simulate the numerical results. Graphs are depicted the approximate solutions obtained by using the suggested numerical approaches under the value of the considered parameters. The dynamics of the suggested model population are graphically shown in Fig. 4 using the Caputo fractional derivative with time sequence framework. Figure 4a shows the population behavior for \u03b8 = 0.7, Fig. 4b shows the population behavior for \u03b8 = 0.8, Fig. 4c shows the population behavior for \u03b8 = 0.9 and the population behavior for \u03b8 = 1.0 is shown in Fig. 4d . Figure 5 shows the solution behavior of S(t), E(t), I 1 (t), I 2 (t), and R(t) for \u03b8 = 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0. Figure 5a shows that the susceptible population decreases rapidly at different rates and stabilizes after about 100 days due to restriction of individual movements. As we can see that the decay rate is faster for a small value of \u03b8 , since the susceptible population S(t) is decreasing, which affects the exposed population E(t) and more individuals get the infection. That is why we see an increase in the exposed population in Fig. 5b . Besides, the exposed population E(t) in Fig. 5b is increased very quickly after 15 days and a decrease occurs ",

The infection increases and decreases quickly for smaller values of \u03b8 . Since we know that many innocent people have been died due to this pandemic, but there are many who have survived as well due to timely treatment and following the SOPs. Most people have been vaccinated and are now protected from infection. 52.9% population have received their first dose of the COVID-19 vaccination worldwide till November 13, 2021 [61] , which reduced the infection and that is why the recovery rate has almost been stable. So in Fig. 5e , it can be seen that the recovery rate is almost 83% of the population. The increase in recovery is due to a strong protection rate, people's awareness about the infection, government action, and vaccination.

The existence theory and uniqueness of proposed model solution have been carried out with the help of Schaefer-and Banach-type fixed point theorems. The local stability of the model is established through the Routh-Hurwitz criteria, which is concluded that the disease-free equilibrium is stable for R 0 < 1, whereas the endemic equilibrium becomes stable for R 0 > 1 and unstable otherwise. The effect of the various parameters on the reproduction number (R 0 ) has also been analyzed. Besides, the transmission of the disease under various fractional orders is investigated. In Fig. 11 , it can be seen that the recruitment rate and symptomatic transmission rate are significantly impacting the reproduction number. Therefore, the COVID-19 epidemic can be significantly reduced by controlling people from migrating and strictly enforcing personal measures simultaneously. The total infected population plot has been compared with the real infected population of India's second wave of COVID-19 outbreak (proportion of the population) in Fig. 12 which showed the great agreement of simulated results in this research with the real data. It is worth mentioning that the proposed model here can be studied under stochastic or fuzzy differential operators in future research.",
