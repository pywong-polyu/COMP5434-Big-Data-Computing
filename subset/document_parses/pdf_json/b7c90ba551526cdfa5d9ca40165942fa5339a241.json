Initially COVID-19 testing was resulting in delays for non-routine procedures or if the procedure was truly an emergency, it was This study is limited by the lack of data on 1) cancelled procedures secondary to the elective nature of the procedure or a positive COVID-19 result, 2) outcomes for patients undergoing procedures during the ban and patients who had procedures delayed, 3) departmental adaptations to the decrease in procedure volume and management of patient rescheduling after the ban was lifted. Additionally, we make the assumption that in the absence of the COVID-19 pandemic, case numbers in 2020 would be similar to 2019.
