One potential method to cut emissions is to convert vessels to battery powered propulsion in a similar manner to that which has been adopted for motor vehicles. Although, battery powered propulsion will not be suitable for all vessels, the conversion of those that are will lead to an increase in the energy demand from the national grid. This study uses historic port call data is used to model the timings of arrivals and the number of vessels in the port of Plymouth to predict the increase in additional energy demand required for battery powered vessels through a period of 24 hours as a greater proportion of the fleet move to battery powered propulsion.",

In 2019, the Department of Transport published the Clean Maritime report [3] stating the aim to reach zero emissions shipping by 2050 to align with the International Maritime Organization (IMO) target of reducing the emissions in international shipping by at least 50% when compared to the levels of 2008 [10] . To address the reduction in emissions from vessels, similar technology employed in the electrification of motor transport can be employed in marine transport. In April 2021, the city of Plymouth became the home of the UK's first sea-going electric ferry [12] and the first UK city to install a network of electric charge points for battery propulsion vessels [13] .",

However the demand of energy from the charging of electric vehicles has been extensively modelled using a variety of methods. The demand for electricity in the Greater Stuttgart area of Germany was studied by [11] by using the mo-biTopp model to simulate the demand and journeys of electric vehicles and hence derive the power demand for this on a weekly basis. The study by [1] took a different approach and combined the use of historical traffic and weather data to identify overarching patterns of travel through the application of machine learning techniques. The time at which electric vehicle charging began was treated as a random variable to identify charging demand patterns during the day through probabilistic methods. Van Viliey et. al. [16] investigated the current and future impact electric cars has on electricity demand and the infrastructure required for generation and distribution by way of efficiency, cost and emissions of greenhouse gases. Studies have carried out to assess both the impact on energy demand and the reduction in emissions, for example the study by [5] , which used a bottom-up approach to the modelling, uses 2005 as the base year to predict the emissions reduction and energy demand in 2035 in S\u00e3o Paulo and into the comparison of different modes of electric transportation to assess the contrast in demand, for example [8] in Christchurch, New Zealand.",

For this analysis, only vessels under 25 meters in length were considered as this length of vessel is more suitable for conversion to battery powered propulsion in regards to the power required from the motor to generate motion. The dataset was initially cleaned to remove any port calls which fell outside the time period of interest, after which vessels of length 25 meters or more where removed. After the removal of these vessels, the dataset was reduced to 9,469 individual port calls and identified 31 different types of vessel. Many of these vessel types had a small frequency of calls and therefore vessel types with a frequency of port calls less than 500 were then removed so to capture the demand which would occur from the most common vessels accessing the port. This final stage of filtering reduced the types of vessels to five, shown in The resulting dataset shows an acceptable balance between commercial vessels and leisure vessels, with the former comprising 53% of the dataset, which allows for predictions from both leisure and commercial usage to be made. Once the vessel types have been selected for analysis,the lubridate [9] package within R [14] was employed to extract the day of the week and the hour of arrival for each of the different vessel types to analyse the distribution throughout the 24 hour period of a day and are shown in figure 2 .

            "text": "The approach taken in this paper has been very simplistic, only taking into account the average frequency of the different types of vessel arrivals in the port of Plymouth in each hour and using set proportions of these averages to predict the potential electricity demand from the charging of the vessels. To create a more accurate model, further analysis should be done to investigate how vessel movements could possibly be tied to the weather conditions and seasonality, for example adopting a similar approach such as the one taken in [1] . Here machine learning techniques such as clustering could be employed to identify patterns and seasonal variations in the vessel movement which would allow for a greater selection of vessel types to be included in the analysis and therefore producing a more robust prediction of the energy demand.",

Additional assumptions used in this analysis include the assumption that charging will begin once the vessel returns to port and that all the marine vessels in the port will be using batteries of the same power. Due to the tiny number of vessels using this technology we currently have no evidence to support such assumptions and further work should include treating the charging start time as a random variable, particularly in the case of the pushers and tugs where it is unlikely that charging will be required every time they return to the port but is not fully known at this point in time.",

This could result in an increase in the number of port calls as vessels will be required to return to port and recharge more frequently then the current distances and times recorded from traditional combustion engines. In addition to this, due to the technology being in it's infancy, rapid charging for marine vessels is not available yet, although discussed here as the preferred method of charging for vessels which would be required to make multiple journeys in a 24 hour period, akin to electric buses.",
