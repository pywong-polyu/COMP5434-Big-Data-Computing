            "text": "To promote healthy growth and development in children, the World Health Organization (WHO) introduced the \"24-h movement behavior guidelines\" for the early years (0-5 years old) in 2019 [1] . The WHO guidelines state that preschoolers (3-5 years old) should (1) engage in physical activity (PA) for a minimum of 180 min per day at any intensity, of which 60 min should be at moderate to vigorous intensity, (2) limit screen time (i.e., using screens such as television, computer, tablet) to a maximum of 60 min per day and limit periods of uninterrupted sitting to a maximum of 60 min at the time and (3) have a good quality sleep between 10 to 13 h per night [1] . These guidelines are highly innovative as they no longer focus on one particular behavior but integrate all behaviors that are conducted within a 24-h time span, namely PA, sedentary behavior (i.e., sitting time) (SB) and sleep. These behaviors interact, which means that time spent on one of these behaviors (e.g., PA) has an effect on the time that can be spent on (one of) the other behavior(s) (e.g., SB and/or sleep) [2] . Sleep, SB and PA are distributed across a 24-h time span on a movement continuum going from no movement (sleep, SB) to high movement (PA). Complying with the 24-h movement behavior guidelines in preschoolers is already associated with health-related quality of life, social-cognitive development and behavioral and emotional problems in this young age group [3] . This underlines the importance of taking all movement behaviors across a 24-h time span into account, since it is already associated with desirable health indicators at a young age.",

Given the fact that PA, SB and sleep are interrelated within one day, it might be interesting to have a better understanding of the distribution of time spent in these behaviors across 24 h. At the moment, there are no studies yet looking at objectively measured 24-h movement behaviors in preschoolers. Although several measurement devices already exist and are being used, most studies on 24-h movement behaviors in preschool children use a combination of objective (e.g., accelerometers) and subjective methods (e.g., proxy-reported questionnaires) [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

The device was initialized using ActivPAL software (version 7) before use. After the ActivPAL was made waterproof by covering the device with a thin finger cot and a transparent 3M Tegaderm tape as proposed by the manufacturer, it was mounted on the preschooler's right anterior thigh midway between the hip and knee, using a second transparent and hypoallergenic 3M Tegaderm tape (10 \u00d7 10 cm).

A 5-point scale (ranging from highly pleasant to highly unpleasant) was used to indicate whether their child found it pleasant or unpleasant to wear the measurement devices. In addition, two questions were asked whether parents found it feasible to let their child wear the devices: \"How did you perceive the feasibility of the wrist-worn accelerometer?\" (i.e., the Axivity), and \"How did you perceive the feasibility of the thigh-worn accelerometer?\" (i.e., the ActivPAL).

The VANE algorithm available in the ActivPAL-software was used to identify sitting, standing and stepping. In addition, the CREA algorithm available in the ActivPAL-software was used to identify the \"time in bed\". Both algorithms provided separate CSV-files which were combined into one CSV-file to match the time in bed with the time the child was awake. For every minute of data, the number of seconds spend sedentary, standing or stepping was provided. Then, one full 24-h time block was randomly selected. A similar protocol as in the study of De Decker et al. (2013) was used to obtain a binary classification for each 60 s interval to enable comparison with the Axivity data [12] . If more than 45 s of the 60 s epoch were spent sitting or lying, this epoch was classified as SB (1) in the SB column. If less than 45 s of the 60 s epoch were spent sitting or lying, this epoch was not classified as SB (0) in the SB column. Based on the CREA algorithm, the time in bed (including start time and end time) was classified as sleeping (1) . A 0 (not sleeping) was added for time spent out of bed. In the activity column, a 0 was added if there was a 1 in only one of the columns of SB or sleeping. A 1 was noted down when there was a 0 in the SB column AND in the sleeping column. In the end, the sum of all minutes in all three columns was made to reflect the total amount of minutes spend in PA, SB or sleep across a full 24-h day when using an ActivPAL accelerometer.",

However, this means that almost half of preschoolers perceived wearing the accelerometers as neutral and even one child found it unpleasant to wear the ActivPAL. Furthermore, most parents found it feasible to let their child wear both devices for seven consecutive days. These results are remarkable, since the percentage of parents making this statement about the ActivPAL accelerometer is much higher (93.8%) compared with the percentage of children actually having valid data for seven days (31.3%). In addition, one parent reported that the standard wrist band of the Axivity was too large for the child's wrist, making it less pleasant to wear the device. Since data collection took place in winter, most parents used their child's thick winter clothing as a tool to decrease the mobility of the wristband by mounting the wristband on top of their child's sweater, jumper or cardigan. However, using the Axivity with the standard wrist bands might cause problems regarding data collection in warmer months (spring, summer) since children are wearing light clothing which might cause more movement of the wrist band and, respectively, more noise in the data collection. Other studies in young children measuring, e.g., PA with the Axivity accelerometer [13] used a specifically designed fabric band around the wrist which enables the measurement of PA in young children without the problem of having a wrist band which is too big.",

The major finding of those analysis was that there was a considerable difference between the ActivPAL and the Axivity accelerometer concerning the measurement of all three behaviors. The mean time in either PA and SB as measured by the ActivPAL and the Axivity was largely different with a mean difference ranging from 110 and 150 min, which corresponds to 2 to 2.5 h. If you take into account that the PA guidelines state that preschoolers should be physically active for 180 min per day, it is apparent that the choice of measurement device has a large influence on the results that will be reported regarding preschoolers' compliance with the guidelines. Although the results for sleep duration seem more promising with a smaller mean difference (i.e., around 40 min), still, a significant difference was found between both measurement devices. In addition, a difference of 40 min of sleep also has a large impact when investigating the prevalence of sleep duration or the proportion of preschool children complying with the sleep duration guidelines. Our results therefore show that there is a large difference in the measurement of PA, SB and sleep between both monitors. When choosing the ActivPAL in measuring preschoolers' 24-h movement behaviors, researchers should be aware that the volume of PA will be higher compared with using the Axivity, while the volume of SB will be lower compared with using the Axivity. Researchers need to take their research question and the characteristics of the measurement device into account before selecting the measurement device relevant for their specific studies. The fact that one parent noticed that the wrist band of the Axivity was too large for the child's wrist might indicate that the preschool age might be too early to use the Axivity using the current available accessories of the device (i.e., wrist band), unless the wrist band created and produced by Open Lab (Newcastle, UK) and used in the study of Prioreschi et al. (2017) in infants and toddlers can be used. In addition, the large wrist band might be a possible reason for the difference in measuring PA and SB, since possible shifts of the device across the wrist might have caused noise in the data. Future studies should therefore take the placement of the accelerometer into consideration with the aim to optimally answer the research question of the study.",

In fact, the original aim of the study was to validate both ActivPAL and Axivity accelerometers to measure 24-h movement behaviors by using direct observation since direct observation can be seen as the golden standard in measuring behaviors. The goal was to film 24-h in a preschooler's day using a GoPro camera. Unfortunately, several limitations appeared after data collection. These were limited battery life and storage capacity causing data loss. In addition, there was an inability to track the starting point of the recording due to a reset of the camera settings every time the camera was switched off. The study of Willets et al. (2018) used a Vicon Autographer wearable camera during waking hours [17] . This kind of wearable camera has the advantage of having a long battery life (~16 h), and storage capacity for over one week's worth of images [18] . The camera automatically takes photographs every 20 s and each photograph is time-stamped which means that duration of activities (e.g., sitting, cycling) can be captured [18] . However, due to preschoolers' intermittent movement behavior pattern [19] it might be a challenge to use this type of wearable camera in this age group, since different activities can be performed within a timeframe of 20 s. This might mean that different short bouts of activity or sitting time might be missed using this kind of camera. Another possibility might be to use several fixed cameras on a tripod that are posted in different corners of the room to ensure that the activities and postures of the child are caught on video. However, again due to preschoolers' intermittent pattern of behaviors [19] , this might be challenging since preschoolers' might leave the room with the cameras as well. In addition, it causes an additional burden for preschoolers' parents. Moreover, it might be possible to use live streaming cameras with an automatic upload in the cloud which enables the fact that we exactly know at what time the direct observation started and problems with memory capacity are avoided.",

There is a difference in measuring PA, SB and sleep using the ActivPAL on the one hand and the Axivity on the other hand. The ActivPAL measures a higher volume of PA across 24 h and a lower volume of SB across 24 h compared with the Axivity. The current study is a pilot study, and future studies should look at incorporating a golden standard such as direct observation to validate both measurement devices for the measurement of PA, SB and sleep across 24 h.
