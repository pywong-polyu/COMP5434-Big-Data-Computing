            "text": "Cooperative behaviour has been found extensively in both human societies and social animals [1] [2] [3] [4] . Studies in game theory have offered insights into the origin of such cooperation, e.g. in terms of public goods games [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, the evolution of society after the establishment of cooperation [15] has rarely been explored. Game theory has been developed to investigate competitive interactions among players (individuals or companies) [1, 16, 17] . The most commonly studied are the prisoner's dilemma (PD) game and the hawk-dove game, the latter generally known as the chicken game (CH) [5, 12, 18] . Mathematical analysis of pairwise games shows that selfish players usually dominate altruistic (cooperative) players. Thus, it is difficult to evolve a cooperative society. To explain the cooperative behaviour of animals, Maynard Smith [3] introduced the game theory to biology and developed the concept of evolutionarily stable strategies. Past studies aimed to explain the evolution and maintenance of cooperation. Various characteristics have been proposed to explain the advantage of cooperation, which are broadly categorized into five rules: (i) kin selection, (ii) direct reciprocity, (iii) indirect reciprocity, (iv) network reciprocity, and (v) group selection [19, 20] .",

            "text": "While games have been considered separately so far (but see [21] ), the weight-lifting game was proposed recently [22, 23] . The weight-lifting game is a grand unified game covering all kinds of five pairwise games, i.e. the PD, the CH, the stag hunt game (SH), trivial cooperation (TC) and trivial defection (TD) [22] . It should be remarked that the two-by-two game is conventionally considered as consisting of four classes because the last two trivial cases (also called C-dominant and D-dominant Trivials [24] ) are not distinguished for their common characteristic of no dilemma [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . Here, we follow the latter terminology, namely C-dominant Trivial (CT) and D-dominant Trivial (DT) in place of TC and TD, respectively [24, 28] . In the weight-lifting game, the probability of success or each player's payoff depends on the number of cooperators in the game. The uniqueness of this game is that we can cover all the pairwise games in a single-game framework by changing the success probabilities, which are considered as input parameters. In the present study, we apply the weight-lifting game model to discuss the evolution of a cooperative society by representing the success probability as a function of a state variable, called environmental value. With this variable, we intend to express the environmental conditions experienced by society.",

To account for empirical results from controlled studies, various modifications and generalizations of game theory and expected utility theory have been put forward [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . For example, behavioural game theory takes account of emotions and limited foresight of average people [33, 34] . Recently, a lab-in-the-field experiment was made to study individuals' behaviour when facing different situations corresponding to various dyadic games [21] . This study supplied interesting empirical data for simulating societies in the context of game theory. They found that the subjects conform to a limited number of behavioural phenotypes (envious, optimist, pessimist and trustful) [21] . The present paper is founded on the conventional framework of game theory, taking a similar aspect to those taken by utility functions in economics [35] . However, unlike the traditional studies that focus on the results of an individual game, we study what kind of game is more likely to be provided depending on the environmental state of a dynamically changing society. This type of social investigation has not been made previously. In relation to the current state of the literature in game theory, the success probability of the weight-lifting game may be compared with context-related parameters in various specific situations, such as relatedness r in the kin selection, the probability of mutual encounter w in direct reciprocity, the probability q of knowing someone's reputation in indirect reciprocity, the average number of neighbours k per individual in network reciprocity and so on [19, 27] .",

We interpret this situation as follows: (i) in a severe environment, the success probability of the weight-lifting game is low even when both players cooperate. (ii) As the environmental value improves, this probability increases. (iii) Further improvement of the environmental value saturates the probability up to the maximum value (unity) independently of the players' strategies.

We demonstrated that the structure of the weight-lifting game dynamically changes as the environmental value varies. In a prospering society, all individuals gain benefits irrespective of their behaviour. For example, members of some rich nations receive a salary without paying tax. Thus, the game and rewards depend on the cultural state (richness) of the society. When the environmental value is low, we found that the structure of the game may become that of the stag hunt game, which has rarely been studied [37] . In a real society, this should correspond to a premature state, in which cooperation has not yet been fully established. Moreover, cooperation is not sustained if the b/c ratio is too low. If we consider that the benefit of cooperation underlies the establishment of societies, true sociality starts from CT with a relatively high b/c ratio. The cooperative society should then proceed via the CH and the PD game to DT, at which point the society collapses.",

In a primitive society with SH game structure, all members being cooperative as well as all members being defective are Nash equilibria. Therefore, some incentive toward cooperation is necessary because a cooperative society does not emerge spontaneously. Since the b/c ratio is not high enough, communities without any cooperation have a good reason to persist in a stable manner. However, once a cooperative society is established for some reason, it will persist, as it is protected against the intrusion of a small number of defectors. Location (interaction with neighbours), signals (transmission of information) and association (the formation of social networks) are suggested factors promoting the establishment of payoff-dominant (cooperative) societies [37] . Another possible reason may be accidental changes in the environment. In any case, the SH state is a necessary but insufficient condition for a cooperative society. As the b/c ratio grows, the condition becomes sufficient, and a true cooperative society in the CT state is established. In future, this dynamical shift in game classes may be translated into the dynamical change in a social dilemma situation (phase plane of gamble-intending dilemma (GID) and risk-averting dilemma (RAD) [27] ) [24] . Then, the stability of behavioural phonotypes in humans may be interpreted as the optimal solution under dynamical societal changes. Thus, the rise-and-fall (prosperity and decline) of human societies may be understood as historical changes in the game structure of the grand unified game.",

Even at the present time, there exist such chemotrophic cycles without photosynthesis in hot springs, deep-sea vents and soil.

It is believed that cyanobacteria have filled the Earth's shallow waters for hundreds of millions of years, thereby transforming the Earth into an oxygenated planet [42] . Photosynthesis is a complex cycle that involves multiple steps, known as the Krebs cycle, and cyanobacteria may have evolved through the symbiosis and integration of many bacteria.

The Ediacaran organisms seen in the late Proterozoic were multicellular eukaryotes and are also considered to have formed obligate symbioses. During the Cambrian Explosion, in the early Palaeozoic Cambrian 544 million years ago, diversification and adaptive radiation occurred, with tissue/organ differentiation in invertebrates such as trilobites [44, 45] . These multicellular organisms were giant symbiotic organisms where countless cells (tissues and organs) cooperated by absolute symbiosis, the birth of a multicellular individual. In this way, organisms have evolved since the origin of life as obligate symbiotic systems.

For example, in colonies of the eusocial insect Pristomyrmex punctatus, eggs are laid and maintained by worker ants, which are parasitized by queen ants of different strains. The parasitic queens lay a large number of eggs but do not care for them. As a matter of course, the parasitized colony eventually collapses, as it is exploited by non-working queens. Unparasitized colonies divide to form new colonies fast enough to cover the loss of parasitized colonies. Here, the relationship between worker and queen ants may be understood as an arms race or as being maintained for some unknown reason [46] . Similar social parasitism has been described in cuckoos (Cuculus canorus) and blackbirds (Turdus merula). This type of social 'free-rider' system is also found in a group of hunting wasps (parasitoid wasps), where free-rider species parasitize other species, often closely related to the free-rider [47, 48] . In such cases, the parasitic members (parasitic birds and wasps) are betraying, so it would not be possible to apply this game directly. However, this transition may be regarded as a shift from CT symbiosis to CH and DT (figures 3 and 4) because the societies (communities of birds and wasps) could afford the reproductive burden of the parasitic species.",

The direct verification of the model is, however, very difficult because such historical rise-and-fall is difficult to quantify. A more concrete verification of the current model is a future step. One possible method is to compare the human responses against the weight-lifting game before and after a radical societal change over a short time period, e.g. before and after the COVID-19 pandemic.

Similarly, the panels in figure 3d-f represent \u03b4 = 1/5. The results indicate that CT occurs only when the benefit-to-cost (b/c) ratio is large (c/b is small) and E \u2248 0.5 (figure 3b,e). Game structure varies depending on the b/c ratio (figure 3c,f ). For a fixed value of b/c, for instance, a game structure may appear as DT-PD-DT (solid arrows in figure 3c), DT-PD-SH-CH-PD-DT (dashed arrows in figure 3c), DT-PD-SH-PD-CH-PD-DT (solid arrows in figure 3f ) and DT-PD-SH-CT-CH-PD-DT (dashed arrows in figure 3f ). It is generally expected that the b/c ratio will increase in an accelerated manner as the environmental value increases to the maximum (E = 1). The game-space trajectory for b/c = 3/(\u03b2 \u2212 E) 2 is plotted in figure 4a,b for \u03b2 = 1.5 and 1.3 (\u03b4 = 1/5). Game structure varies according to the sequence DT-PD-SH-CT-CH-PD-DT, while some of the intermediate games may be skipped or modified depending on specific details of the b/c trajectory (figure 4).",
