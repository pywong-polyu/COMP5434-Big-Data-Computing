During COVID-19 restrictions, remote spotting (e.g., using a telephone, video call, and/or a social media app) emerged to address physical distancing requirements and reduced access to harm reduction and/or sexually transmitted blood borne infection (STBBI's) prevention services.

Spotting calls often began with setting an overdose response plan (i.e., when and who to call). Many participants noted that, due to the criminalization of drug use and fear of arrest, they preferred that roommates/friends/family members be called instead of emergency services in case of an overdose. Both spotters and spottees raised concerns about the timeliness of overdose response, particularly in remote and rural settings.",

This remote method of supervision has become more salient during the lockdowns, stay at home orders, physical distancing requirements, service restrictions/closures and self-isolation orders during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Most overdose deaths are currently being driven by unregulated fentanyl and fentanyl analogues in the street-based opioid supply, with recent data indicating that fentanyl was a direct contributor to mortality in 87% of opioid-related deaths occurring during the COVID-19 pandemic in Ontario [11] . Similar reports have been documented by the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, which state that over 80,000 overdose related deaths occurred across the United States from May 2019 to May 2020, with a substantial increase documented between the months of March and May 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic [12] . Additionally, unregulated benzodiazepines such as etizolam & flurazepam are being increasingly detected in fentanyl samples by drug-checking programs and during post-mortem toxicology, highlighting the volatility of the unregulated drug supply [13] .",

For example, Health Canada reported over 19,000 opioid-related deaths between January 2016 and September 2020 [10] . Canadian reports also indicate that 94% of overdose-related deaths were accidental and 80% of deaths involved fentanyl or fentanyl analogues in 2019 [14] . While harm reduction interventions such as SCS, OPS, NSP, and even a safe supply of drugs have expanded in number, PWUD continue to face access barriers (i.e., geographic accessibility, drugrelated stigma, discrimination, or gender-related concerns such as violence and gendered stigmatization) [15] [16] [17] [18] . Although the expansion of these harm reduction services have occurred in some provinces across Canada such as in Ontario, many others such as Newfoundland or Prince Edward Island, do not have or fund SCS or OPS spaces for these lifesaving services. Even within provinces which have implemented harm reduction services, there remains limited access to such services in urban, rural, and remote regions [19] [20] [21] . Lack of access has resulted in many PWUD using drugs alone in their private residences, increasing risk of overdose and drug-related morbidities [22] [23] [24] . For example, reports from Ontario, Canada indicate that three out of four overdose-related deaths which occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic took place when \"no one was present to intervene\" [11] . Literature from British Columbia, Canada document that PWUD engage with substance use alone as it improves convenience, comfort, and reduces experiences of stigma and discrimination [25] .",

All members of the team have extensive experience in conducting harm reduction research and/or have lived/living experience of substance use and were consulted in the design of the study and study material. Given our recruitment strategy, certain participants had existing relationships with one of the interviewers. All participants were asked if they were comfortable with this prior to engaging with the study. Each potential participant was given the study phone number and email address. People who contacted the study team were screened for eligibility and were provided with an overview of the study objectives.

This is the first study to report on spotting in the literature and to address this issue during the COVID-19 pandemic. PWUD use spotting as a method to ensure that overdose response will be available if needed. They also highlighted that barriers to accessing appropriate harm reduction services including NSP/ SCS and STBBI's prevention services, as well as fears of criminalization made spotting an appealing 'safety net' in the context of a continuing overdose crisis. Among those who did not inject drugs, spotting provided access to overdose prevention which was otherwise inaccessible. Spotting has the potential to mitigate risk environments which are prevalent for PWUD and during the COVID-19 pandemic, has created opportunity for PWUD to connect with someone improving overdose prevention and physical distancing. Spotting's role in facilitating overdose prevention during the pandemic is critical given closures and reduced capacity of in person harm reduction care [11, 24] .",

As we document, spotting provided a perceived reprieve from the risk of criminalization faced when engaging with in person harm reduction services and when using in spaces other than one's home. However, many feared arrest if 911 were called. This fear has been documented by others. Kolla and Strike [32] document fear of police amongst people operating SCS in their homes. Latimore and Bergstein [33] reported a similar concern in a study of PWUD in Baltimore, Maryland. The majority of participants feared arrest after calling emergency services for an overdose event. Many were not aware of the Good Samaritan Law which was designed to extend \"immunity from low-level charges and/or parole violations to overdose victims or bystanders who call 911, or otherwise seek medical attention\" [33, p. 3, 34] . Evans and colleagues [35] further substantiated these findings as they reported that among 198 people who used non-medical prescription opioids only 45.5% were aware of the Good Samaritan Law enacted in Rhode Island.",

Moallef and Hayashi [36] outline how knowledge of Good Samaritan Laws among police officers and emergency service responders is generally low across North America. Limited knowledge of this law amongst first responders facilitates negative experiences associated with overdose events for PWUD. Improving knowledge among these groups may therefore play a role in increasing the effectiveness of Good Samaritan Laws [36, 37] . Jakubowski and colleagues [38] reiterate this point by advocating for incorporating Good Samaritan Law knowledge within overdose prevention training programs and services which has the potential to improve the effectiveness of Good Samaritan Laws. However, increasing opportunities for knowledge dissemination surrounding Good Samaritan Laws do not address longstanding mistreatment of PWUD by the police.",

(Spottee 28) Spotting calls most often included discussion of an overdose plan before the spottee used drugs. Issues such as whom to call, when to call, and what the spottee might do to reduce harm should they overdose were discussed on the majority of calls. For example, a spotter told us: So, what I did was, I called the girl over FaceTime. We came up with a plan; so she didn't want me to call 911 because she was a parent. So, she said if she would overdose, to let her mom know and to guide her mom and how to use the naloxone and what to do, in that moment, should it happen. (Spotter 1)",

Which I rarely, don't use those, like, I don't use ah, stimulants for that reason. But, I wouldn't be able to use a stimulant in an overdose prevention site, because I would go into psychosis, and it would feel very uncomfortable and I would be embarrassed, versus being in the comfort of my own home, where I feel like I have some privacy.

Cause then, they can understand like, why you're doing what you're doing. So, they can counteract in term of help, in the right way. (Spottee 5) Spotters described benefits of spotting both for spottees and for themselves in explaining how spotting improved their sense of pride and accomplishment. One spotter expressed: I think the benefits of spotting are that people are safe. And that's mainly for the person who's using. The spotters, I think they can, I think, they, like, there's something to be said for feeling like you're accomplishing something, and feeling like you're helping someone. And I think that's what the spotters can take away from it. (Spotter 1)",
