Previous studies found that both DNA methylation modification and gene alternative splicing (AS) play a key role in tumorigenesis of glioma, and there is an obvious regulatory relationship between them. However, to date, no comprehensive study has been performed to analyze the influence of DNA methylation level on gene AS in glioma on a genome-wide scale. Here, we performed this study by integrating DNA methylation, gene expression, AS, disease risk methylation at position, and clinical data from 537 lowgrade glioma (LGG) and glioblastoma (GBM) individuals. We first conducted a differential analysis of AS events and DNA methylation positions between LGG and GBM subjects, respectively. Then, we evaluated the influence of differential methylation positions on differential AS events. Further, Fisher's exact test was used to verify our findings and identify potential key genes in glioma. Finally, we performed a series of analyses to investigate influence of these genes on the clinical prognosis of glioma. In total, we identified 130 glioma-related genes whose AS significantly affected by DNA methylation level. Eleven of them play an important role in glioma prognosis. In short, these results will help to better understand the pathogenesis of glioma.",

            "text": "Conversely, the previous studies reported that pathogenesis of glioma is significantly associated with the dysregulated alternative splicing (AS) in the brain (Mogilevsky et al., 2018; Pattwell et al., 2020; Zeng et al., 2020) . AS is the primary driving force behind generating diverse proteins, which is the basis for the remarkable and complex functional regulation seen in eukaryotic cells (Xie et al., 2019) . Genome-wide studies showed that 90-95% of human genes undergo some level of AS, and almost one-third of them were proved to be generated multiple protein isoforms (Kim et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2021) . These processes usually show an extreme complexity in brain tissues and can play an important role in the progression of many CNS diseases (Merkin et al., 2012; Galarza-Munoz et al., 2017; Consortium 2020) . For glioma, for instance, Mogilevsky et al. discovered that the manipulation of MKNK2 AS significantly suppressed the oncogenic properties of GBM cells and resensitized the cells to chemotherapy (Mogilevsky et al., 2018) . Pattwell et al. found that a truncated splice variant, TrkB.T1, increases PDGF-induced Akt and STAT3 signaling and further enhances PDGF-driven GBM in vivo (Pattwell et al., 2020) . Moreover, many previous studies indicate that there is a strong link between DNA methylation and AS and it generally contributes to the pathogenesis of CNS disorders, including glioma (Feng et al., 2019; . For example, transcriptome analysis revealed that PTEN methylation influences mature mRNA transcripts through modulation of pre-mRNA AS, and the methylation-defective PTEN R159K mutant is found most frequently in glioma patients. There was mark dysregulation of splicing factors in the PTEN-deficient GBM samples (Feng et al., 2019) . The important oncogene METTL3 is a methyltransferase and it is found to modulate the nonsensemediated mRNA decay of splicing factors and AS isoform switches in GBM. The methylation modification of serine-and arginine-rich splicing factors by METTL3 promotes GBM tumor growth and progression .",

Therefore, in this study, we performed a genome-wide analysis by integrating the DNA methylation and AS data of 537 lowgrade glioma (LGG) and GBM individuals. First, we downloaded the relevant data from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), TCGA SpliceSeq and EWASdb database, respectively. Second, we conducted the differential analysis between LGG and GBM samples to identify the glioma-related methylation positions and AS events. Third, based on the results, we performed a splicing quantitative trait methylation loci (defined as me-sQTL (Gutierrez-Arcelus et al., 2015; Han and Lee 2017) ) analysis to explore the influence of DNA methylation level on gene AS in glioma. Fourth, we further explored the characteristics of these me-sQTLs and affected AS events. Fifth, combining the data of disease risk methylation positions from EWASdb, we performed the two-tailed Fisher's exact test to investigate the disease specificity of the me-sQTLs and identify the potential key genes related to them in glioma. Finally, based on these potential key genes and clinical data, we conducted the least absolute shrinkage, univariate Cox regression, selection operator (LASSO) regression, clinical correlation and survival analysis to explore the influence of these genes whose AS events affected by DNA methylation on clinical prognosis of glioma. The flow chart is shown in Figure 1 .",

According to the annotation of TCGA, glioma is classified as the LGG and the GBM. TCGA is a global genomic profiling project that utilizes high-throughput microarray technologies to identify molecular subtype classifications of cancers, multigene clinical predictors, new targets for drug therapy, and predictive markers for these therapies (Vigneswaran et al., 2015) . The International Classification of Diseases for Oncology has been used for nearly 25 years as a tool for coding diagnoses of neoplasms in tumor and cancer registrars and in pathology laboratories (Warzel et al., 2003) . Data analysis was performed with the glioma classification LGG and GBM provided by the TCGA database. Current glioma classifications are based on the 2007 WHO grading scale, which separates gliomas based on cytologic features and degrees of malignancy after hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining (Erridge et al., 2011) . According to the classification of gliomas in the TCGA database, data analysis is carried out by using the classifications LGG and GBM of gliomas provided by the TCGA database. We accessed these TCGA data using the Genomic Data Commons (GDC) data portal (https:// portal. gdc. cancer.gov/). Particularly, based on our previous study (He et al., 2020) , we first selected \"DNA methylation\" for the Data Category, \"Illumina human methylation 450\" for the Platform, \"brain\" for the Primary Site and \"gliomas\" in the Disease Type to screen out the suitable methylation array of patients in the GDC data portal. Then, the\"clinical,\" \"brain\" and \"gliomas\" were selected to the Data Category, Primary Site and Disease Type, respectively, to screen out the clinical information of patients in the GDC data portal. Finally, we removed samples that lacked methylation or clinical information.",

Finally, to identify the potential key glioma-related genes at the me-sQTL level, we compared the proportions of cis and non me-sQTLs in glioma-related methylation positions for each gene using the two-tailed Fisher's exact test (the threshold of p < 0.05).",

First, we calculated the average expression of these genes in each individual and separated the samples into low and high expression groups according to the median of average expression. Then, we used the Kaplan-Meier overall survival curves to compare prognosis between the high expression and low expression individuals. Next, we performed a univariate Cox regression analysis to assess the association between these me-sQTL genes and the prognosis of glioma. The threshold of significance was set at 95% confidence interval (CI) of hazard ratio (HR) S 1 and p < 0.05. Then, based on the results of univariate Cox regression analysis, the R package \"glmnet\" was used to perform the LASSO regression analysis, a fit algorithm based on cyclical coordinate descent and warm start search along a regularization path, to identify the main glioma prognosisrelated genes (Simon et al., 2011) . According to the common parameter settings, the maxit and alpha were set at 1,000 and 1, respectively, and others were set by their default values. Based on the results, the risk scores were calculated for each subject by the R package \"survival\" (http://CRAN.R-project.org/package= survival). Further, the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used to verify the reliability of these risk scores by the R package \"survivalROC\" (https://CRAN.R-project.org/ package=survivalROC). Finally, we used the chi-square test to assess the association between the expression of these glioma prognosis-related genes and other clinical features of the patients, which included the age at initial pathologic diagnosis, the vital status, and the gender. The threshold for significance was set at the p value <0.05.",

By comparing the proportions of cis me-sQTLs and non me-sQTLs in each disease risk methylation position dataset (the threshold of Fisher's p value <0.05), we found that the cis me-sQTLs significantly enriched the risk methylation position dataset of 103 diseases, which are mainly composed of CNS disorders and malignant tumor diseases including glioma (odds ratio (OR) = 2.49, p = 0). In contrast, the remaining 38 diseases, whose risk methylation positions are not significantly enriched by the cis me-sQTLs, are mainly composed of the other types of disorders, e.g., the rheumatic heart disease (p = 5.99 \u00d7 10 -1 ), septicemia (p = 6.97 \u00d7 10 -1 ), and Infertile (p = 1).

The expression data were obtained from TCGA database and these data are involved in 117 of the 130 potential key genes. We found that the overall survival curve of the subjects with high expression of these genes is significantly longer than the subjects with low expression (p = 7.56 \u00d7 10 -1 ( Figure 4A ). This revealed that the expression dysregulation of these potential key genes is significantly associated with the bad prognosis of glioma patients. To avoid dependence between the 117 genes and identify the main glioma prognosis-related genes, we performed the univariate Cox regression analysis of the 117 genes. However, the results showed that 61me-sQTL genes identified are high-risk factors for the prognosis of glioma subjects (i.e. 95% CI HR S 1 and p < 0.001) (Supplementary Figure S3) . We discover that both over-expression of those 30 genes and under-expression of the other 31 genes can lead to a poor prognosis in glioma patients, which is also consistent with common sense. given that patients are in advanced stages of the disease and their survival may be affected by other complications or factors. Then, we further applied the LASSO regression algorithm to conduct the selection and calculate the risk score of each subject to univariate Cox regression results. The results showed that there are 11 genes (i.e., KIF3A, HAUS1, TMCC1, BEND7, B3GNT5, MTMR3, ITGB3, BICD1, EXTL3, SUN1 and MXRA8) identified when the cross-validated partial likelihood deviance reaches its minimum value ( Figures 4B,C) . Among the 11 genes, the coefficients of 7 were positive (i.e., increase risk of disease), and others were negative (i.e., decrease risk of disease). A previous study reported that the low expression of the TMCC1 gene confers poor clinical prognoses of glioma patients which is in accordance with our findings (Pangeni et al., 2018) . The area under the curve (AUC) of the ROC is 0.988, which reveals the reliability of the risk score ( Figure 4D ). According to the median of risk scores, the patients were separated into the low and highrisk groups. We found that the LGG and GBM subjects are mainly distributed in the low and high-risk group, respectively, which reflects the consistency between the risk scores calculated by the prognosis-related me-sQTL genes and the severity of glioma. Moreover, the results of chi-square test showed that the risk scores of the prognosis-related me-sQTL genes are also associated with the age at initial pathologic diagnosis (p = 4.89 \u00d7 10 -2 ) and vital status (p = 1.81 \u00d7 10 -9 ), but not with the gender of the patients (p = 4.60 \u00d7 10 -1 ) ( Figure 4E ). This proves that the 11 key genes we found are meaningful for clinical prognosis of glioma. Among the 11 genes, 7 of them (i.e., B3GNT5, BICD1, KIF3A, HAUS1, MTMR3, ITGB3 and EXTL3) have been confirmed to be associated with the prognosis of glioma (Kim et al., 2011; Sumazin et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018; Jeong et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . Our findings imply that the functions of these genes in glioma prognosis may be related to the methylation regulation of their AS events.",

In total, we identified 130 such genes which have the following three characteristics: 1) they are significantly differentially expressed between the LGG and GBM subjects; 2) their AS events are significantly regulated by DNA methylation level in the cis regions; and 3) the cis me-sQTLs of them are significantly enriched in glioma risk methylation position dataset. Further, the results of clinical data analysis show a significant association between the expression of these genes and the clinical prognosis of glioma, and among them, 11 (i.e., KIF3A, HAUS1, TMCC1, BEND7, B3GNT5, MTMR3, ITGB3, BICD1, EXTL3, SUN1 and MXRA8) are considered the key risk factors for the prognosis and severity of glioma. At the same time, these 130 genes provide new ideas for the study of the interaction between DNA methylation and alternative splicing in gliomas and similar diseases and provide reference for future research on the study of DNA methylation and variable splicing in neurological diseases in the whole genome. In summary, we performed a strategy to explore the influence of DNA methylation level on gene AS in glioma and these findings will help to better understand pathogenesis of glioma.",
