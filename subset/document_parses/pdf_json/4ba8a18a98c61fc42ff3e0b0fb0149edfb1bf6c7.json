Furthermore, AI learns from \"wrong\" behavior, and the severity of such adverse experiences and failures varies from case to case. Consequently, AI decision outcomes can also differ from that of human (34) . To assess the reasoning process, protocols are required for the status ante, the status quo concerning the time taken for a decision, the number of scenarios considered, and the accuracy of the result obtained by AI. Subsequently, the responsibilities of different stakeholders in AI processes should be addressed. For instance, in the real-world case of AI-based automatic robotic surgery, it is required to differentiate between accountability, liability, and culpability (35) . A clear task differentiation is necessary, so that accountability can be clearly defined based on the process steps (e.g., x-ray image analysis), liability can be limited (e.g., manufacturer, operator, maintenance) and culpability can be exclusively attributed (e.g., an obligatory second human check of a decision obtained by an AI application).",

The CEA analysis refers to a cost comparison of a new vs. an old method, for example, regarding blood glucose measurement, wound size, or symptom-free days. In CUA, the outcome is measured in healthy years, for example, measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Specifically, QALYs provide an estimate of how many extra months or years of life, a person might gain by undergoing a specific treatment. Under a cost-minimization approach and the precondition of an equal medical outcome, different treatments can be compared. The difference between the approaches is that while the CBA can answer whether a new digital service is worthwhile, the CEA can answer the question of which of the alternative services is less costly to reach the equivalent outcome. Figure 6 provides an overview of the different categories.",

Thus, research on very recent developments such as AI policy frameworks, frequently has not yet been conducted or published. Third, there are significant differences across categories. For example, an AI-supported medication adherence system and an AI-driven robotic surgery software are subject to different policy, technological and medical as well-economic impact measurement requirements. As a consequence, success factors will have to be weighted according to the Digital Health and AI conditions in each healthcare system. Due to these limitations, several further success factors could not be included in the model, but should be a focus of further research and are here briefly discussed.",
