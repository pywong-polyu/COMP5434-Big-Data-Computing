Moreover, Stance-BERT always outperforms the other non-stance models BERT(comment), BERT(tweet) and BERT(tweet-comment). These results confirm our hypothesis that the stance feature extracted from user comments data can effectively contribute to rumour detection at the early stage. Moreover our approach of modelling stance for tweet-comment pairs is especially effective.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 168, "end": 175, "text": "Table 3", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Stance-Based Models Versus Non-stance Models"}, {"text": "By transfer learning using the language model BERT, it better captures the language features. In more specific terms, BERT can adjust the weights associated with the model to better represent text originating from comments. This means that during classifier fine-tuning, the starting points of the weights are closer to values that correctly model Twitter data. Closer values mean that the model has a better chance of finding good representations, even with very limited amount of training data. To evaluate the utility of stance transfer, we randomly selected 80 samples within the 40-min window from the Twitter15 dataset and use t-SNE [17] to visualize the embeddings of [CLS] for BERT (without stance transfer) and Stance-BERT, which shows the hidden state for sequence embedding. As shown in Fig. 6 , Stance-BERT clearly performs better than BERT by grouping the same type of rumours into clusters. It confirms that transferred stance knowledge work effectively with rumour data. In addition, the clear boundaries among different types of rumours shows that strong stance signals exist in the user comments, which confirms our hypothesis that stance can help directly on rumour detection at the early stage.

Experiments on two public Twitter datasets showed that user comments contain early signals for detection rumour tweets.
