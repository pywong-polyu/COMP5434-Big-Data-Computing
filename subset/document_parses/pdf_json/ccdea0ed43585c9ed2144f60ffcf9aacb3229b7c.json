Assessments including range of movement, muscle strength, endurance, pain, special orthopaedic tests (shoulder/elbow), Berg Balance Scale, timed up and go, timed stance test, six-minute walk test, steps in 360-degree turn, Movement Assessment Battery for Children (2 nd Edition), step test, ABILHAND assessment, active straight leg raise, and circumferential measures of the upper limb were reported as valid/reliable in limited populations and settings (many with small sample sizes). Participants appeared to embrace telehealth technology use, with most studies reporting high levels of participant satisfaction. If given a choice, many reported a preference for in-person physiotherapy assessments. Some inconsistencies in visual/auditory quality and challenges with verbal/non-verbal communication methods were reported. Telehealth was considered relatively cost-effective once services were established.",

Telehealth has been defined by the World Health Organisation (WHO) as 'the use of telecommunications and virtual technology to deliver health care outside of traditional health care facilities' [8] . The information and communication technologies (ICT's) used in the delivery of telehealth services allow the transmission of health information such as voice, data, and still or video images over short and long distances, without the need for recipients of care or health professionals to be co-located [9] . Telehealth includes delivery of assessment and diagnosis, treatment, and preventative and curative aspects of health care [9] , and can be provided using synchronous methods (real-time), or asynchronous methods (store and forward) [10] .",

Maintaining access to physiotherapy services during this time has been challenging for many health care providers [11, 12] where area lockdowns and distancing requirements have interrupted and limited face-to-face service provision [11] , initiating a shift in the way physiotherapy services are provided to clients [13] [14] [15] . Many health services and/or professional associations, such as the Australian Physiotherapy Association, NHS and Chartered Society of Physiotherapy (UK), have released advice and guidelines to support clinicians providing telehealth services during the COVID-19 pandemic [16, 17] . Although this increased use of telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic has been essential in ensuring continuity of care from many allied health and medical practitioners [14, 18] , concerns have been raised regarding the limited evidence supporting these changes to physiotherapy practice across the lifespan [13, 15] .",

Two systematic reviews, both limited to the field of musculoskeletal (MSK) physiotherapy and with a focus on the adult population, have been conducted [19, 25] to investigate the validity and reliability of conducting physiotherapy assessment via telehealth. In 2017, Mani and colleagues investigated the use of internet-based physiotherapy assessments within the MSK field of physiotherapy, concluding that it is feasible to use telehealth systems to assess swelling, range of movement, pain, muscle strength, balance, gait and functional outcomes in adults referred to physiotherapy [19] . In 2018, Grona and colleagues investigated the validity and reliability of synchronous videoconference use in the assessment and management of adults presenting with MSK conditions [25] . Grona and colleagues concluded that synchronous video-based telehealth systems could be viable when assessing and managing adults with MSK conditions but may have poor reliability for assessments of the shoulder joint and elbow joint, and for nerve tests, scar assessment and lumbar posture assessment [25] . A small number of systematic reviews on telehealth have been conducted in other settings such as neurology [26, 27] and aged care [28] , with a focus on health and activity, using asynchronous monitoring systems or wearable devices.",

The Brink and Louw CAT was developed in 2011 and was based on the Quality Appraisal of Diagnostic Reliability Studies (QAREL) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS) tools [31, 32] . The CAT was designed for use in systematic reviews that investigate validity and reliability of assessment tools. It uses a series of 13 questions scored as 'yes', 'no' or 'not applicable', with five of the items referring to validity and reliability, four items specific to validity and the remaining four items specific to reliability [31] . The CAT does not provide a quality rating [32] . To provide a quality rating for each study, we calculated a quality percentage and subsequent rating ( Table 3 ) based on the number of items where 'yes' was given as the response, divided by the total number of items available to be scored, depending on the study type. Similar rating scales have been used by other authors when employing the Brink and Louw CAT, reporting a score of \u226560% as indicating 'high quality' [32] [33] [34] [35] .",

Findings were synthesised using a critical narrative approach in which the strength of evidence from individual studies was considered, based on the methodological quality of each study. Findings of individual studies were reported in tables and figures with particular consideration given, in the reporting of results, to findings from studies performed in real-world rural or remote contexts rather than simulated contexts. A meta-analysis was not conducted due to the clinical and methodological diversity in the types and methods of telehealth assessments used and heterogeneity of the reported outcomes of the studies included in the review.",

Of the 39 articles reviewed, 18 studies investigated the concurrent validity and/or reliability of synchronous telehealth physiotherapy assessments ( Table 4) .

Most studies described participants in detail (n = 13) and the index test in enough detail to enable replication (n = 12). The statistical methods used within each article, although varied, were appropriate to the research question. One study failed to explain participant withdrawals and one did not provide qualification details of the raters involved. Among the studies that investigated the concurrent validity of conducting a telehealth assessment when compared to a face-to-face assessment (n = 15), some failed to explain the face-to-face assessment (n = 3) or it's execution in enough detail to allow replication (n = 6). Most studies (n = 13) included a face-to-face assessment that was completed independent of the telehealth assessment and all studies considered a time frame between the two assessments that was short enough to limit changes in assessment findings.",

Two larger studies investigated synchronous, telehealth physiotherapy assessments conducted in healthy populations [61, 63] . Variability was also observed across the utility studies, with participant numbers ranging from one (case studies) to 2249 [72] . There was inconsistency in the execution of telehealth assessments across practice settings, with some participants accompanied by a friend or relative [50, 60, 74] , teacher's aide [63] or health practitioner (nurse or less experienced physiotherapist) [10, 46, 50, 53, 76] to assist with the assessment. The experience levels of clinicians conducting telehealth assessments also varied. Physiotherapy students under supervision performed telehealth assessments in some studies (n = 6), whilst others involved physiotherapists with extensive experience (up to 31 years) or post graduate training in specialised areas of practice [45, 46] .

Challenges identified by those participating in telehealth consultations in rural areas included: the consent procedures look longer; a lack of access to equipment/specialised equipment in the home setting; using unfamiliar technology; viewing and positioning of the camera; poor quality video; and problems with data file size [10] .",

Nine studies conducted similar satisfaction surveys [4, 45, 58, 59, 67, 69, 71, 73, 74] , with questions asked rated on a visual analogue scale (VAS). The questions included: 1) level of confidence in, or how beneficial they rated the online assessment, 2) would they recommend a telehealth assessment to a friend who is unable to travel, 3) is telehealth as good as face-to-face appointments, 4) visual clarity, 5) audio clarity, and 6) overall satisfaction [4, 45, 58, 67, 69, 71, 73, 74] . Most questions asked rated highly in each of these nine studies (>6/10 VAS). If given the choice, many preferred the face-to-face method of assessment. This trend was also seen in another study [76] , indicating high levels of agreement that the timing, organisation, communication, and overall expectations were met using this service delivery method, but most preferred face-to-face appointments if available.",

UC physiotherapy consultations rated significantly higher in terms of satisfaction when compared to telehealth [72] and the acceptance of a telephone physiotherapy consultation service was variable, with some participants commenting on the 'hands on' nature of physiotherapy not able to be accomplished over the phone and that the PD service impaired access to 'proper' physiotherapy services [66] .

A variety of laptop and desktop computer systems was used, along with wall-mounted, external or embedded cameras. Some papers required participants to use their own smart device (ie, iPad, tablet, phone) during the telehealth consultations, whilst others had telehealth assessment equipment set up in a room ready for the consultation. Additional peripherals such as pulse oximeters, LCD screens, tripods, portable speakers and microphones were used in various studies. Several studies reported inconsistencies in technology as limitations, which included: low/fading audio and sound quality [47, 56, 58, 70] ; voice disconnection [60] ; problems with video quality [56, 58] ; communication failures [69] ; image resolution issues [74] ; freezing of live images [60, 71] and other technical problems not specified [52] . The usability of telehealth to complete physiotherapy assessments was reported in two studies [47, 56] which used the System Usability Scale [78] as an outcome measure. Both studies reported positive responses (scores \u226585 out of a possible 100) and patients seemingly willing to adopt the telehealth technology.",

Some participants had more difficulty explaining and comprehending information [71] or did not stay in the range of the microphone.

One study involved a cost audit comparing a video conference telehealth physiotherapy service with a fly-in, fly-out physiotherapy service [46] . Telehealth appeared to be a cost-effective option for rural services, with an estimated 12-month cost of AUD$66 518.00 compared to AUD$76 384.00 for a fly-in, fly-out service [46] . The other study compared cost-effectiveness of a telephone-based telehealth physiotherapy service (PD) with usual face-to-face care (UC) [55] . The authors found the difference between the PD and UC groups was minimal in terms of cost, finding PD is probably more cost-effective if the physiotherapist's time is productive. However, underutilisation of the service increased costs of the PD service slightly compared with UC, which were then offset by improvements identified through health-related quality of life questionnaires (quality adjusted life years).",

Such discretion was apparent in six of the validity and/or reliability studies [4, 45, 58, 69, 71, 73] , where telehealth clinicians could decide which assessment measures to use. These studies all reported on the validity and reliability of clinical diagnosis (primary or pathoanatomical, and systems diagnosis) and management decisions rather than specific assessment tools, except for one study [58] which reported on both.",

Just over 60% of studies published were in a real-life community, hospital or home setting, with six of these papers set in a rural or remote area that faced limitations in access to physiotherapy services. The major findings of this review demonstrate that performing many types of physiotherapy assessments via synchronous forms of telehealth appears to be valid and reliable, with those more observational in nature more easily performed and having higher levels of validity and reliability. Participant satisfaction levels with telehealth assessments were generally high, although when asking participants if they would favour or select a telehealth assessment compared with a face-to-face assessment, most would prefer the latter. The utility of telehealth amongst physiotherapy areas of practice is expanding, with increased perceptions of its acceptability among health care professionals and recipients of care when service access is a problem. Research within this area is also growing, with approximately two thirds of included studies published in the last 5 years, and later studies adapting their telehealth assessment techniques based on the findings and issues reported by earlier researchers.",

The current review considered a broader range of physiotherapy assessment tools than have been previously considered. For example, a systematic review investigating the validity and intra-and inter-rater reliability of telerehabilitation (TR) physiotherapy assessments for patients with specific musculoskeletal disorders was reported in 2016. That review, conducted by Mani and colleagues [19] identified eleven studies that met eligibility criteria and included both synchronous and asynchronous forms of assessment. A more recent review by Grona and colleagues [25] , also in the field of musculoskeletal physiotherapy, investigated video conferencing consultations, including both assessment and intervention aspects of the telehealth service. Seven of the studies that were included in both of these previous systematic reviews also met the eligibility criteria of our systematic review. Neither of these previous systematic reviews investigated all synchronous forms of physiotherapy assessments used across all areas of physiotherapy practice.",

There were no studies meeting our inclusion criteria that investigated physiotherapy assessments with infants or with children of any age with existing difficulties in gross motor function. This population arguably would benefit greatly from telehealth assessments performed within the home setting, not only to ease the travel burden for families and improve access, but also to gain a better insight into the child's function in the home environment. Children feel more comfortable and display a greater repertoire of skills when in their home environment, as compared to that of a physiotherapy clinic [79] . There were also no studies that examined the validity and reliability of synchronous telehealth assessments in the clinical areas of elite sport, gerontology, occupational health, men's health or other specialty areas of physiotherapy practice, including hand and orofacial physiotherapy. Only a very small number of validity and reliability studies, investigating assessments relevant to limited types of health conditions, were identified in cardiorespiratory, paediatrics, chronic pain, neurological and cancer care (particularly lymphoedema) physiotherapy. It could be argued that individuals requiring physiotherapy consultation in these less represented fields of physiotherapy may benefit the most from having valid and reliable telehealth assessments, given the need for specialised services (which may not be present in regional, rural or remote areas) or limited ability to travel due to illness. Individuals requiring a physiotherapy assessment for conditions that fit within these areas of practice (for example, those that have existing cardiorespiratory conditions, are immunocompromised, or older adults), are also those classified in the 'highest risk' groups for COVID-19 and would at times require telehealth rather than face-to-face consultations, particularly when disease transmission is of concern [80] .

Four of the studies included in this review evaluated or described how clinicians had transitioned to telehealth for maintaining physiotherapy services for their patients [50, 64, 68, 77] . Prior to COVID -19, the use of telehealth was seen as a way to reduce barriers to accessing services, such as distance, inability to travel, or unavailability of a physiotherapist in the local area [7] . Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen the value of telehealth change, with physiotherapists completing synchronous physiotherapy assessments while located within the same hospital as the patient, and at times, just outside a patient's room [50] . This change in the way we utilise telehealth services in the 'real-world' encourages us to consider more closely and perhaps increasingly value findings of studies that have been conducted in 'simulated' environments where the physiotherapist and participant are collocated in the same building. The way in which specific assessments were performed via telehealth also needs to be considered when interpreting the results. Some studies did not include a detailed description of how the assessments were performed or adapted to meet telehealth requirements, and others used non-standardised, functional activities to assess underlying impairments.",

Most participants thought telehealth would be useful for those unable to travel to or access a suitable physiotherapist in their local area but would not prefer it over a face-to-face appointment. This finding is consistent with previous research investigating patient satisfaction using synchronous and asynchronous forms of telehealth in medicine, which reported that telehealth can provide a high-quality service, increase access to care, decrease travel time and empower patients to manage their chronic conditions, but can be met with resistance from those who have difficulty embracing change [81] .",

As technology advances and becomes more readily available within the community, there appear to be improvements in levels of digital literacy with an increased proportion of the population classified as 'digitally native', having grown up with access to technologies and having subsequent competence in navigating those that are new [82] . This may change the levels of acceptance and usability of technologies such as telehealth in the future and further limit inconsistencies identified in this systematic review. Consequently, it would be advantageous to consider developing further research studies within this topic area with the latest technology, for example 4K HD Cameras, inclusive of larger sample sizes.",

Some studies also found that participants were more reserved in their conversation when assessment was conducted over telehealth, or that participants did not understand etiquette required for a video conference consultation [71] . Others reported difficulties in observing posture, as some participants were not comfortable de-robing during the telehealth [74] consultation for a variety of cultural and personal reasons. When working with diverse community groups, Pollard and colleagues [83] suggests we must consider the cultural and ethical needs of individuals, which requires planning, flexibility and sensitivity. As we move forward with utilising synchronous telehealth methods to perform physiotherapy assessments in clinical contexts, we must consider the validity and reliability of the assessment measures used with respect to our clients, and also their presenting condition or diagnosis and contextual factors including the environment they are in and available resources, individual needs and cultural beliefs [83] . These are important elements to consider when deciding if telehealth is appropriate for clients, or if another method of assessment and service delivery is appropriate.",

Telehealth assessments that required a greater degree of technique were also more complex in nature and more difficult to interpret when conducted by telehealth. For example, MSK special tests and neurodynamic testing were less reliable and valid when completed using telehealth systems than when performed face-to-face. This is not surprising, given the extensive training and experience that physiotherapists possess in manual handling and the value that the sense of 'feel or touch' can add to interpretation of assessments [87] . Those assessments that involved the use of questionnaires also appeared to be more valid and reliable than some other types of assessment, when conducted via telehealth. This finding is in line with a previous systematic review which reported good test-retest reliability for questionnaires measuring shoulder function [88] .

The methodological quality of the papers varied, with some papers not adequately describing the telehealth assessments completed or reporting limited information in their findings. The repeated measures design used for many of the validity and reliability studies included in this review has the potential to create a learning effect, with results also influenced by the irritability of the client's condition.

Levels of training and experience with telehealth systems also varied and should be considered when interpreting results for use in the clinical practice setting. Less experienced clinicians may not achieve the same level of validity and reliability outlined in studies within this review. Telehealth, however, can foster further professional development of less experienced clinicians by enabling more experienced and specialised clinicians to join physiotherapy assessments from anywhere using telehealth, provided they have a stable internet connection and an appropriate device. This 'peer learning' was observed in the utility study by Cottrell and colleagues [46] , however further studies investigating the validity and reliability of this method of assessment would be beneficial across a broad range of physiotherapy practice areas. Whilst some studies utilised experienced clinicians, some of these were not experienced in the telehealth assessment process. Training in telehealth use is suggested to improve clinician competence, knowledge and acceptance, leading to better skills in using the technology and a higher likelihood of utilising it with clients when suitable [89] .

Instead, risk of bias was carefully considered through the critical appraisals performed. Given this was an exploratory study, several case studies/series were included in the results of this systematic review. We acknowledge case studies are considered a low level of evidence and caution needs to be used when interpreting their findings. Some practical information provided through the collection of these case studies can, however, be useful in clinical practice, for example the practicalities of completing a telehealth assessment, including the time it takes to conduct an assessment and the immediate responses of health services during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, most of the research to date on use of telehealth for physiotherapy assessments has been conducted in the MSK field of physiotherapy. Given the recent shift towards this method of service delivery throughout the globe, more research is needed across all areas of physiotherapy. Evidence of validity, reliability and utility of assessments across other areas of physiotherapy practice is emerging but more research with larger sample sizes investigating synchronous telehealth physiotherapy assessments performed in real-world contexts, on readily available technologies and for a range of impairments, is required.",

Initial challenges of telehealth consultations included scheduling, care coordination, patient availability and development of a digital communication strategy. Barriers included nurse availability, patient availability & willingness and increased physical/environmental demand to complete telehealth assessments.Results of thematic analysis. Four key themes emerged suggesting that video consultations mediate an active patient and relative involvement, mediates access to care, mediates room for co-operation between health care professionals and medicates technical device use.
