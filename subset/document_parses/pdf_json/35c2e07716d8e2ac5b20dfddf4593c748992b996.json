It is particularly benefited the diabetic subjects with heart conditions. Aims We aimed to obtain a real-world data about the effects of empagliflozin add-on treatment on metabolic parameters, cardiovascular risk factors, and anthropometric measures in patients with T2DM. Methods Type 2 diabetic patients with established coronary heart disease whom empagliflozin added to their treatment were enrolled in the study. Anthropometric measures, clinical and laboratory data, were obtained before and at the 6th month of the empagliflozin treatment. All data before and at the 6th month were compared. Results Body weight (p < 0.001), body mass index (p < 0.001), waist (p < 0.001) and hip (p < 0.001) circumferences, systolic blood pressure (p = 0.006), heart rate (p = 0.01), LDL cholesterol (p = 0.01), fasting plasma glucose (p < 0.001), and HbA1c (p < 0.001) levels were significantly reduced on 6th month of empagliflozin treatment compared to the baseline values. Estimated GFR (p = 0.66), serum creatinine (p = 0.8), uric acid (p = 0.40), total cholesterol (p = 0.053), triglyceride (p = 0.057), and HDL (p = 0.09) levels were not significantly changed. Conclusions We suggest that empagliflozin treatment may improve anthropometric measures, metabolic parameters, and blood pressure and does not cause deterioration in kidney functions in type 2 diabetic patients with established coronary heart disease.",

Anthropometric measures have been studied in type 2 diabetes mellitus, and it has been established that BMI and waist circumference were associated with the risk of T2DM [10] . These measures also predict the risk of cardiovascular diseases [11] . Therefore, glucose-lowering treatment should be accompanied with measures that reduce body weight, waist circumference, and BMI. The effects of empagliflozin and metformin were compared in subjects with polycystic ovary syndrome, another insulin-resistant state, and authors concluded that empagliflozin caused significant improvements in body weight, waist circumference, hip circumference, and BMI compared to metformin [12] . Treatment duration was 12 weeks, and half of the treatment duration in present study, which was 6 months. Nevertheless, empagliflozin caused 1.4-kg reduction in weight, 1.4-kg/m 2 reduction in BMI, 1.6-cm decrease in waist circumference, and 2 cm of shrinkage in hip circumference [12] . The present study showed that addition of empagliflozin on current T2DM treatment for 6 months provided 3-kg reduction body weight, 1.3-kg/m 2 decrease in BMI, 4.3 cm narrowing in waist circumference, and 2.6 cm shrinkage of hip circumference. Two other studies were suggested similar reductions in body weight, waist circumference, and other anthropometric measures [13, 14] . The results of our report were comparable with the data in literature.",
