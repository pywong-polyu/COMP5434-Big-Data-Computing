Five self-interactions were confirmed, and five interactions, Nsp1/Nsp3.1, Nsp3.1/N, Nsp3.2/Nsp12, Nsp10/ Nsp14, and Nsp10/Nsp16, were determined to be positive bidirectionally. Using the replicon reporter system of SARS-CoV-2, we screened all viral Nsps for their impacts on the viral replication and revealed Nsp3.1, the N-terminus of Nsp3, significantly inhibited the replicon reporter gene expression. We found Nsp3 interacted with N through its acidic region at N-terminus, while N interacted with Nsp3 through its NTD, which is rich in the basic amino acids. Furthermore, using purified truncated N and Nsp3 proteins, we determined the direct interactions between Nsp3 and N protein.",

As of now, no anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific drug was available in clinical therapy, except for the FDA's approval of Veklury (remdesivir), clofazimine and topotecan. Veklury could only shorten the duration of hospitalization of COVID-19 patients if early administration within 48 h of hospital admission was applied [1] . Combined with remdesivir, clofazimine exhibited antiviral synergy in cell culture and animal models [2] . Topotecan suppresses infection-induced inflammation, thus reducing morbidity and rescuing mortality in a transgenic animal model [3] . However, the efficacies of these drugs on patients await further clinical investigation. Vaccines developed using different strategies were authorized by many countries to contain the infection of SARS-CoV-2. However, there are growing concerns about safety like antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE), the duration of the effective anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response, and the effectiveness against the mutant viruses [4] [5] [6] . Thus, the anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific drugs are urgently needed, and more drug targets on this deadly virus are waiting to be uncovered.",

The polyprotein is encoded by the open reading frame (ORF) 1a and 1ab, and the latter is translated via the mechanism of -1 ribosomal frameshifting. The ORF1a and ORF1ab are processed by the viral proteases, papain-like protease (PLpro) and 3C-like Protease (3CLpro), into 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps), which compose the replicase complex through an unknown manner. The other 10 ORFs encodes 4 well-known structural proteins, spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and envelope (E), and a set of accessory proteins without clearly identified functions, ORF3, ORF6, ORF7a, ORF7b, ORF8, and ORF10 [9] .",

The expression of all the viral proteins in both pM and pVP16 vectors were examined, and the expressions of 11 proteins in pM vectors and 9 proteins in pVP16 were confirmed using immuno-blotting (Additional file 1: Figure S2 ). Despite that the expressions of some proteins were not detected, the interactions, such as Nsp16/Nsp10, were still detected, indicating that the mammalian two-hybrid system is sensitive enough to detect interactions between proteins, which were not expressed well. The sensitivity and efficiency of the mammalian two-hybrid system were also confirmed by detecting the interaction of p53 and SV40T, which could lead to more than 130 times of increase in the relative expression level of reporter genes compared with negative controls (Fig. 1A) .",

            "text": "We screened 784 interaction combinations between all the coding sequences of Nsps or ORFs of SARS-CoV-2, and the assays on each combination were repeated at least three times (Fig. 1B) . 48 positive interaction combinations were screened out and analyzed using Cytoscape software to visualize molecular interaction networks (Fig. 1B, C) . Some interactions were confirmed using co-immunoprecipitation (Fig. 2 Unlike the Nsp1 of SARS-CoV, which barely interacts with other viral proteins, Nsp1 of SARS-CoV-2 has the most interaction partners, 9 Nsps and 7 accessory proteins, among all the viral proteins, and likely functions as the hub of the group of viral proteins (Fig. 1B, C) . As the first viral protein being expressed after viral infection, Table 1 The sequences of SARS-CoV-2 used for interaction analysis n/a not applied *The coordinate of the sequence is based on the genome of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 isolate Wuhan-Hu-1 (NCBI Reference Sequence: NC_045512.2) **Abbreviations: ADRP adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1\"-phosphatase, SUD SARS Unique Domain, OGB oligo(G)-binding, PLpro papain-like cysteine proteinase, DU deubiquitinating activity, TM transmembrane domain, RdRP RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, GFL growth-factor-like protein, NTPase NTP and RNA 5' triphosphatase, ExoN 3' to 5 the function of Nsp1 as a hub likely was an advantage for virus to organize the assembly of replicase complex and replication of viral genomic RNAs. Besides its function in suppression of protein expression and defense against host innate immune response [18] , the vital role of Nsp1 in the viral replication is supported by the clinical observation that a deletion in the C-terminus of Nsp1 attenuated the viral pathogenicity [19] . Nsp3 is one of the most complex proteins and has multiple functional domains [20] . The well-known function of Nsp3 is to process viral polyprotein at cleavage sites of Nsp1/2, Nsp2/3 and Nsp3/4. In our interaction screening, Nsp3 was found to interact with Nsp10, Nsp12, Nsp13, and Nsp14, indicating its possible roles in the replication/transcription of viral RNAs besides the process of viral polyprotein. Nsp5 is responsible for the cleavage at the sites separating Nsp4 to Nsp16, spanning 1a and 1b regions. Similar to SARS-CoV, Nsp5 of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with Nsp12, indicating that Nsp12 could be the sites in 1b for Nsp5 to grasp its substrate [17] . In agreement with the previous findings that Nsp8 and Nsp12 form the core RNA polymerase complex, Nsp8 of SARS-CoV-2 interacts with Nsp12 [21, 22] . As an RNA binding protein, Nsp8 may facilitate the substrate recognition of Nsp12. We identified 9 interactions Nsp10 involved in, and among them, the interactions of Nsp10/Nsp14 and Nsp10/Nsp16 were also uncovered in our previous work for SARS-CoV [17] , indicating a conservative mechanism of the genus Betacoronavirus for regulation of the activity of methyltransferase of Nsp14 and Nsp16. We also identified many interactions between Nsps and accessory proteins, indicating that the possible roles of accessory proteins in the replication/transcription of viral RNAs. 5 self-interactions, Nsp3, Nsp5, Nsp15, and N reported here were also found in SARS-CoV, except for ORF8, which is one of the most distinct ORFs between SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 [23, 24] . We failed in screening out the several known interactions, such as Nsp7/Nsp12 and Nsp7/Nsp8. The replication and transcription complex (RTC) of SARS-CoV-2 is assembled in a double membrane structure in the ER-Golgi complex. This special viral membrane environment could be different from the nuclear compartments, where the two-hybrid system works. The folding of the protein could be impacted by these different environments, thus leading to various behaviors in the interaction with another proteins. Therefore, the capacity of the mammalian two-hybrid system could be impacted by the microenvironment of the different intracellular loci.",

In this screening, the interaction between Nsp3.1 and N was among the strongest ones ( Fig. 1A) and was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation ( Fig. 2G ).

To determine N protein's key domains interacting with Nsp3.1, we examined the interactions between various domains of N and Nsp3.1 using co-immunoprecipitation. NTD retains the capability to interact with Nsp3.1, while this capability of N protein is largely lost in CTD (Fig. 3B , C). We also examined the locations of N and Nsp3.1 proteins in the cells. The immunostaining results showed that similar to the wild-type (wt) N, NTD colocalized with Nsp3.1 in the 293T cells, while CTD lost the colocalization with Nsp3.1 ( Fig. 3D -F). We could not detect the expression of the coding sequence of SR, which happens typically in the expression of proteins with a molecular weight of less than 15 kDa. In our laboratory practice, we increase the size of protein by fusing our target protein with a tag protein, like EGFP, which has a relatively independent structure and unlikely interferes with the function of target protein. As predicted, we detected the decent expression of EGFP-tagged SR. However, Nsp3.1-HA could not be detected in the pull-down samples of EGFP-tagged SR, similar as that of EGFP, while, in contrast, the decent level of Nsp3.1-HA was detected in that of EGFP-tagged N (Fig. 3G, H) . Moreover, NTD seems to interact with Nsp3.1 in a stronger manner than N protein, indicating that the other domains of N protein could negatively impact the interaction with Nsp3.1 (Fig. 3C ).",

Based on analysis of the protein sequence, we found a special domain rich in negatively charged amino acids in the N-terminus of Nsp3.1 (Fig. 4A) . As a nucleic acid-binding protein, N protein has a 10.1 of pI and is composed of many positively charged amino acids, which facilitate its interaction with nucleic acids with negative charges and likely also with acidic proteins (Additional file 1: Figure S3 ). Accordingly, we first examined the interaction between N protein and the aa 1-235 of the N-terminus, which possessed the most acidic amino acids in Nsp3.1. Despite the loss of nearly two-thirds of Nsp3.1, aa 1-235 retained the capability to interact with N protein (Fig. 4B, C) . To further narrow down the region that interacts with N protein, we removed aa 1-102, which has the most acidic amino acids, from Nsp3.1 and examined its interaction with N protein. As predicted, the deletion of aa 1-102 largely abolished Nsp3.1/N interaction (Fig. 4G, H) . By observing the colocalizations between N and truncated Nsp3.1, we confirmed that only aa 1-235 of Nsp3.1 plays an indispensable role in the interaction between Nsp3.1 and N ( Fig. 4D -F). To further confirm the dependency of aa 1-235, we deleted aa 1-235 in Nsp3.1 and found the deletion abolished the interaction between Nsp3.1 and N (Fig. 4I ).",

We expressed and purified GST-Nsp3.1 (aa 2-111) and His-N (aa 2-419) from bacteria and performed GSTpull down assay, verifying their interactions (Fig. 5A) . To quantify the interaction affinity, we performed a microscale thermophoresis (MST) assay, which showed aa 2-111 of Nsp3.1 bound to aa 2-419 of N protein with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 0.56 \u00b1 0.07 \u03bcM (Fig. 5B) .

Consistent with our IP results, partial (Fig. 5D ) or complete (Fig. 5E ) deletion of CTD retained the interaction with Nsp3.1. Sequence analysis indicated that 43 basic amino acids at the N-terminus of N were likely dispensable for the interaction if the N-Nsp3.1 interaction depended on the attraction between the acidic and basic domains (Fig. 5F) .

The replicon of SARS-CoV-2 (nCoV-replicon) constructed by our lab expressed the S gene-deleted full-length RNA of viral genome. The deletion of S gene abolished the generation of viruses which raised concerns of biosafety. We replaced the coding sequence of S gene with the reporter gene firefly luciferase, whose expression is driven by the transcription regulatory sequence (TRS) of S gene, and the replicon with firefly luciferase is named as Rep-Luci (Additional file 1: Figure S4A ). We verified the activity of the replicon by quantifying the expression of subgenomic RNAs of viral genes (Additional file 1: Figure S4C ). The mutations of S759A/D760A/D761A (SDD) in nsp12, which impaired the RdRP activity, abolished the activity of replicon, indicating that the activity of firefly luciferase could reflect the level of replication and transcription of the replicon (Additional file 1: Figure S4C ).",

Many viral Nsps promoted the activity of Rep-Luci, but Nsp3.1 inhibited the activity and the expression of subgenomic RNAs of replicon, indicating its potential as an inhibitor for viral replication (Additional file 1: Figure S4B and S4D). We further examined the inhibitory effect of aa 1-80, aa 1-101, or aa 1-235 of Nsp3 on the activity of Rep-Luci (Fig. 6D) . All of the truncated Nsp3.1 proteins, as well as full-length Nsp3.1 protein, inhibited the replication and transcription of replicon, and the inhibitory effect of aa 1-235 of Nsp3 was in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6E) . Except that the inhibitory effects of aa 1-80 and aa 1-101 of Nsp3.1 protein were comparable, the inhibitory effects increased in the order of aa 1-101, aa 1-235, and the full-length of Nsp3.1. Interestingly, the coverage of the region of Nsp3.1 of these truncated mutants was also increased in this order. To further confirm the dependency of aa 1-235, we deleted aa 1-235 in Nsp3.1 and found the deletion abolished the inhibitory effect of Nsp3.1 on the replicon activity (Fig. 6F) . The co-immunoprecipitation results showed that the interaction between aa 1-235 and N was much stronger than that between wt Nsp3.1 and N, indicating that Nsp3.1 could inhibit the function of Nsp3 independent of its interaction with N. As the truncated form of natural Nsp3 protein, Nsp3.1 could exhibit a dominant-negative effect through inactivation of the other function of wt Nsp3 protein. .

Except some of them may function independently, many of them should form protein complex to regulate the replication/transcription of viral genome RNA, the assembly of viral particles, escape from the recognition of host immune defense system, and other functions [7, 18] . Protein-protein interactions play important roles in the processes mentioned above, and thus the disruption of the critical interactions could result in the inhibition of viral proliferation. The drugs developed on these targets are virus-specific, and unlikely inhibit the functions of host cells. COVID-19 has spread worldwide for more than a year, and anti-SARS-CoV-2 specific drugs were urgently needed. The new essential interactions for viral replication will be helpful for viral drug developments. An independent intraviral protein-protein interactome of SARS-CoV-2 finished recently by Liang group uncovered 58 interactions using yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation. Using the different system, we also identified the 34 interactions which were reported by Liang group. Due to the different strategy for screening the protein-protein interactions, we identified 14 interactions which were not detected in the study of Liang group. Among the 14 interactions, the self-interaction of ORF8 and Nsp3-N interaction were as strong as some known combinations, such as Nsp10-Nsp14/Nsp16. This further indicated that the proteins might behave differently in various cell contexts, and thus the interactions that happened in mammalian cells are likely not to be detected in yeast and other cell systems. Indeed, in our previous work, we reported six novel viral protein-protein interactions of SARS-CoV, which were not uncovered in the other studies using yeast system.",

Non-structural proteins were processed from the same polyproteins, and thus, their coordination was likely set up while being expressed. As the main interaction protein of viral genome RNA, N protein was believed to play an important role in viral replication and transcription, despite that molecular details for this role were still obscure. Therefore, after establishing the intraviral proteinprotein interactome, we focused on the interactions between Nsps and N protein. In our interaction map, the interaction between N protein and Nsp3.1 was tested to be positive in both directions.

Our results showed the Nsp3.1-N interaction could perform in a manner of charge attraction, indicating a less site-specificity. We found the interaction between NTD and Nsp3.1 was stronger than that of N and Nsp3.1, and CTD, composed of basic residues, negatively impacted the interaction.

Note that in a dose-dependent manner, NLS-N or NLS-Nsp3.1 inhibited the expression of luciferase, the reporter gene in pG5-Luc, promoted by the interaction of AD-Nsp3.1 and BD-N. B HEK293T cells were transfected with Nsp3.1-HA, aa 1-235 of Nsp3.1-HA, Flag-N, LPC vector, and EGFP as an indicator for transfection effection. 36 h post-transfection, the cells were subjected to the co-immunoprecipitation assay and WB analysis. C The intensities of HA or Flag stained bands of each sample were quantified using LI-COR Image Studio software, and ratios of the intensities of HA/Flag bands were calculated. Note that in a dose-dependent manner, aa 1-235 of Nsp3.1 competed with Nsp3.1 for the interaction with N. HEK293T cells were transfected with Rep-Luci, RL, and various truncated Nsp3.1 proteins (D-F). 48 h post-transfection, the cells were subjected to the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay. Note that all truncated Nsp3.1 proteins except \u03941-235 of Nsp3.1 (F) inhibited the replication of replicon of SARS-CoV-2, and the aa 1-235 of Nsp3.1 inhibited the replication of replicon in a dose-dependent manner (E)",

The conserved domains of Nsp3 of SARS-CoV-2. The diagram of Nsp3 with indicated conserved domains was produced according to the description of YP_009725299.1 of CDD of NCBI. The separation sites aa 749 for Nsp3.1 and aa 1462 for Nsp3.2 were labelled in the diagram. Figure S2 . The expression of all the pM and pVP16 constructs. HEK293T cells were transfected with the indicated pM (A) and pVP16 (B) constructs. 36 h post-transfection, the cells were collected and subjected to WB, and the blots were stained with indicated antibodies. Figure S3 . Acid-base analysis for the viral proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2. Viral proteins encoded by SARS-CoV-2 were listed in the order of PI values. Note that N is the most basic protein and Nsp3.1 is among the most acidic proteins of SARS-CoV-2. Figure S4 . The regulatory effect of various Nsps on the replicon of SARS-CoV-2. The cDNA of SARS-CoV-2 genome was inserted in the BAC vector. Its expression was driven by the human Cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter upstream of its sequence. The bovine growth hormone polyadenylation (BGH) was employed to terminate the transcription and was removed by a hepatitis delta virus ribozyme (RZ) to generate the authentic 3' terminal sequence of SARS-CoV-2. The S gene was replaced with firefly luciferase to eliminate the generation of live virus and to quantify the replication of replicon. ",
