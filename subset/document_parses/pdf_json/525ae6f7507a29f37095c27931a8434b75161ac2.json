These symptoms may appear 3-6 days after exposure, based on the virus's incubation period of 0-14 days being assumed by the World Health Organization [11] . The current criterion standard clinical diagnostic tool for COVID-19 is the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis extracted from a saliva or mucus swab sample [12] . However, there are a number of variables affecting their sensitivity in clinical practice, including the stage of infection, specimen type and handling, and the sufficiency of the specimen [13, 14] . Thus, suspected COVID-19 cases need to be isolated during the RT-PCR test processing time to reduce the risk of disease transmission [13, 14] . In addition, the main concern during a pandemic is about the availability of RT-PCR testing. Therefore, chest radiological examinations with CT and/or X-rays have been used in several studies along with RT-PCR for the early diagnosis and management of COVID-19 progression [7, 9, 12, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

The acquisition parameters for CT examinations were as follows: tube voltage, 120 kVp; 100-150 mAs; collimation, 0.625-5 mm; pitch, 0.75-1.5; and image reconstruction (slice thickness, 1.25 mm/interval, 1.25 mm). All scans were done from the upper level of the thoracic inlet to the inferior level of costophrenic angle.

In addition, the study explored all the different radiological features from both chest X-rays and CT images. However, the study had some limitations. First, it included only positive laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases; negative results or suspected cases were not included in the analysis. Comprehensive investigation of the imaging features of suspected COVID-19 patients with negative results and confirmed positive results to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other lung-infection diseases is recommended. Second, we did not have follow-up CT images in our cohort to explore changes in CT imaging features and compare them with clinical parameters for patients with severe cases. This could help in the management of disease progression and outcome prediction to support clinical decision making [39] . Further research is needed to evaluate the relationship between chest imaging features and clinical characteristics in COVID-19 cases in Saudi Arabia.",

The imaging pattern of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients was bilateral peripheral ground-glass opacities and consolidation involving the lower and middle lung zones. Elderly males were more affected by COVID-19 than females, with fever and cough being the most common clinical symptoms. The present study demonstrates clinical and radiological characteristics of COVID-19 similar to previous studies reported worldwide. Our study suggests that combining evaluation of radiological features with laboratory and clinical findings could help in early diagnosis of COVID-19.",
