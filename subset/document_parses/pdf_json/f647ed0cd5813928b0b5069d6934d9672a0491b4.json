Healthcare systems have been severely tested, in particular hospitals and primary care settings. The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic imposed a series of changes into diagnostic and treatment approaches because of the risk of virus transmission and the need of working in sterile environments. In this setting, the recent diffusion of handheld ultrasound devices has led to significant clinical benefits. The diagnostic approach to COVID-19 and its possible complications through a point-of-care-ultrasound (POCUS) evaluation could represent a good solution in the primary care setting [3] . The need to evaluate a vast population of patients, combined with the need to reduce the risk of virus transmission for both operators and patients, represents a critical point in all care areas, from hospital units to emergency and primary care settings [4] . The low availability of diagnostic methods is associated with an urgent need to find solutions to achieve prompt diagnosis, fast treatment initiation and effective triage of patients at risk of clinical deterioration who need urgent hospitalisation [5] . In this narrative review, we aimed to examine the role of POCUS during the COVID-19 pandemic and to rethink the usefulness of its long-term use for clinical governance in the primary care setting.",

However, its integration into the primary care setting requires caution due to the differences between primary care and other treatment settings [6] . Wordsworth [7] analysed its usefulness by comparing costs and quality of scans in a primary care setting vs an urban teaching hospital, showing that scanning patients at the primary care level reduce the number of hospital scans, out-and in-patients visits and emergency admissions. Although costs are higher in the outpatient service than the hospitals, the total average costs are lower because of the avoidance of hospital admission [8] . Steinmetz et al. [9] pointed out some of the most valuable and common applications of POCUS in the primary care setting, ranging from screening tools of abdominal aortic aneurysms, intrauterine pregnancy, gallstones, severe left ventricular dysfunction, and diagnosis of musculoskeletal injuries. Moreover, Andersen et al. [10] have shown an overall positive experience by patients undergoing POCUS in a general physician's (GP's) office: above a total of 691 patients interviewed, 96% of them reported that they had a very positive (n \u00bc 334) or positive (n \u00bc 220) experience of being examined with POCUS by the GP. Despite this, there is a large variety in primary care physicians' access to home ultrasound. Andersen et al. [10] showed that in a sample of GP's clinics in 20 European countries, in-house access to abdominal ultrasound was widespread in Germany (98.0%), Slovenia (41.4%) and Switzerland (40.6%), but somewhat less available in Croatia (1.5%) and Denmark (1.9%). Pelvic ultrasound, instead, in comparison with abdominal ultrasound, was less commonly used in general, with the highest percentage of application in Finland (30.8%), POCUS could offer several potential advantages in terms of clinical management and integration into primary care services, even if there are still missing data on diagnostic accuracy and outcomes.",

This method shows a good accuracy in detecting the presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a relevant sensitivity [15] , and it is considered the technique of choice in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection [16] . In hospital and emergency care settings, the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia is usually reached by computed tomography (CT), by revealing ground-glass opacities, consolidation, reticular pattern and crazy paving pattern [17, 18] . In the primary care setting, the use of POCUS could help the physicians better identify patients at high risk of clinical worsening and find signs suggestive of pneumonia or other complications directly at patients' homes. CT is reserved, after hospital admission, to those cases with moderate to severe symptoms and/or with respiratory failure; the sensitivity of chest CT imaging for COVID-19 was 97% [19] . Asymptomatic and mild-symptomatic patients, without lung failure and that can be managed at home, could benefit more from POCUS, preventing unnecessary hospital admissions since the massive overload of the health services [20] . Recently Di Gioia et al. [21] found that lung ultrasound (LUS) alone in the Emergency Department (ED) has a diagnostic perfomance high enough to play a role in ruling out COVID-19 pneumonia, showing a sensitivity of 85.6%, specificity of 91.7% and overall diagnostic accuracy of 89.4%.",

In the COVID-19 Hospitals, Triage or Pre-Triage Units were located outside the Emergency Department, with different levels of organisation, but constituted mainly by dedicated physicians, paramedics and adequate equipment, with the ability to perform rapid tests, RT-PCR tests, serologic testing and ultrasound, since POCUS has been suggested as a tool in the early diagnosis and follow-up of COVID-19 patients [22] . Studies on clinical manifestations of COVID-19 with POCUS imaging include several findings, but most of them are not specific for COVID-19. The BLUE protocol, developed in 2008, allows quick differential of patients presenting in the ED with acute respiratory failure [23] . The pandemic has represented an opportunity to set new algorithms and protocols. In fact, Bianchi et al. [24] applied a 12-scan protocol for COVID-19 patients to stratify their diagnostic process, with 86% sensitivity, 71% specificity and 89% negative predictive value. Moreover, Morin et al. [25] developed an algorithm inspired by Lichtenstein's BLUE protocol with the hypothesis that LUS performed during the initial examination can detect high-risk patients with COVID-19 and address the patients to better management. Narinx et al. [26] confirmed that the application of a 6-scan POCUS protocol in early triage in the Emergency room might provide a practical, rapid, low threshold and safe screening tool in the evaluation of a possible COVID-19 disease, with high sensitivity (93.3%) and negative predictive value (94.1%).",

The latter is known to be significantly increased in COVID-19 due to the endothelial damage, recurring in particular to CUS of lower limbs veins. Both cardiac and vascular ultrasound monitoring could be applied in primary care by experienced GP or specialists, even though existing POCUS guidelines are based mainly on hospitalised patients and may not apply to general practice [27] .",

This distinction, which seems to be more effectively performed by CT diagnostics [29] , can be alternatively made by LUS [30] , identifying in particular two phenotypes: the L-type, characterised by a reduced lung elastance with consequential high compliance, and the H-type, which on the other hand shows low lung compliance, opposed to high elastance. The differences between the two phenotypes affect the type of ventilation that must be applied. Specifically, the L-type appear to be more responsive to low levels of PEEP, while the H-type, which is closer to a classic form of ARDS, would better respond to high PEEP values therapy. Thus, it seems clear that the role of POCUS and, more specifically of LUS, is crucial, as underlined by Hussain [4] according to these lines of recommendation in respiratory failure due to COVID-19:",

The accuracy of portable devices was a hot topic even before the pandemic [50] [51] [52] . They have been indicated before for the study of abdominal organs, trauma but also for the execution of procedures, for example, knee injection for arthritis, finding of ascites or pleural effusion and consequently to follow paracentesis and thoracentesis. Although portable devices have shown good efficacy and reliability, they have some limitations, such as the lack of sensitivity of Doppler US for the evaluation of some superficial structures, vessels, diagnosis of tumours, ectopic pregnancies and the study of the obese patients [53, 54] . The use of POCUS has demonstrated a precious role in monitoring the possible clinical evolution of patients [55] . All the ultrasonographic pathologic features of LUS seem to be helpful in the management of the SARS-CoV-2 patients in the primary care setting, helping the physicians of primary care to evaluate the presence of lung involvement in SARS-CoV-2 infection, together with a clinical and parameters evaluation and guide the clinicians to manage the patients at home or at the hospital as schematically represented in Figure 4 . The POCUS evaluation could also represent a tool to diagnose other complications, as pleural effusion or cardiovascular alterations (deep vein thrombosis, cardiac effusion, right ventricle dysfunction, etc.). Thus, the doctors are expected to a global evaluation of COVID-19 patients, directly at home, from the moment they can evaluate SpO2, respiratory frequency, the presence of dyspnoea or other symptoms and the severity of pneumonia through LUS and the appearance of the principal complications, reducing the occurrence of inappropriate access to Emergency services and anticipating the need for hospitalisation in patients who show signs of worsening.",

POCUS could help the primary care paediatricians to evaluate paediatric patients with SARS-Co-V-2 infection without recurring to traditional radiology with X-ray and CT [57, 58] , with an important saving of exposure to radiation, that is a crucial point, especially in children [59] . Recent studies have underlined the importance of LUS in paediatric patients with COVID-19. Hizal et al. [60] showed that LUS confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary involvement in 83,3% of paediatric patients that had positive CT findings. Moreover, LUS demonstrated normal lung patterns among 93,75% of patients who had normal CT features. The sensitivity and the area under the receiver operating characteristics curve identified by the chest X-ray and LUS tests were compared and significantly different, with superiority of LUS.",
