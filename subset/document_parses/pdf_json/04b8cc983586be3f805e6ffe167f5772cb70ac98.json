In addition, its continuous supervision could be used as a method to detect future diseases due to the subtle changes in the respiratory function that common diseases present prior to the onset of clinical symptoms [5] .

The virus causes a lower respiratory tract infection in most cases reducing the overall efficiency of the lungs, which results in an increase in the BR [7] .

If the algorithm fails to detect the face in the first frame, it searches for a face in the following frames until the face region is detected. At this point, it is interesting to note that the algorithm searches for the user's face in the whole image, so there is no strict condition on the location of the user in the image, as long as the face and the ROIs are visible. Once the face is successfully detected, a boundary box around is obtained. The dimensions and position of this bounding box are then used to compute the ROIs in which the respiratory signal is going to be acquired. Therefore, the adaptation of the detection algorithm to the physiology of the user is ensured. In order to define the ROIs, it is important to consider the resolution of the output image. In our case, the resolution of the frames is 640 \u00d7 480, meaning that each frame could be seen as a 640 \u00d7 480 matrix whose upper-left vertex corresponds to the point (0, 0) while its lower-right vertex corresponds to the point (640, 480). The detection algorithm returns the position of the face in the form of the (x f ace , y f ace ) coordinates that correspond to the upper-left vertex of the bounding box and both the height, h f ace , and the width, w f ace , of the face.

Lately, the validation of the proposed equations was performed with the video samples of the experiments. Note that the mean depth value of the pixels encapsulated within the ROI is then used for the assessment of the signal and that the whole body's trunk experiences respiration movements. Therefore, although these equations have been proved to provide the smallest error in the experiments, the effect of slightly modifying the ROI in size or in position-because of both face size and body shape-has not been shown to have a direct impact on the acquired signal. In addition, these ROIs have been shown to be adaptable in a range distance up to 2 m with respect to the camera. Nevertheless, for the normal operational mode of the acquisition system, the background mask is applied at a distance of 1.5 m with respect to the camera. ",

The length of the window applied has been adjusted considering a good trade-off between a smooth output signal and not displacing the maximum and minimum values of the signal along the timestamp. Finally, the slightly averaged signal is passed through a bandpass Butterworth filter with a high cut-off frequency of 0.5 Hz and a low cut-off frequency of 0.08 Hz. The cut-off frequencies correspond to 30 bpm and 4.8 bpm, respectively. As a reference, the normal BR for people over 7 years old ranges from 12 to 20 bpm [30] . Again, the resulting signal is a smoother one that maintains the time location of the breathing peaks and troughs of the original signal. At this point, the parameters of interest that are commonly used to track the respiration signal could be computed. For example, the BR can be computed from the acquired signal from either the time between consecutive peaks or the time between consecutive troughs. The frame rate of the camera has been set to 15 fps as a good trade-off between a stable frame rate and a sufficient number of samples to reproduce the signal. With the selected frame rate, the depth module of the camera resolves one sample every 0.0667 s, on average. Note that the most time-consuming routines of user's face location and computation of the ROIs are performed with the RGB channels aside from the main execution of the depth value acquisition. Therefore, the actual time of computing the mean of the ROI and filtering (O(1)) is negligible with respect to the intrinsic delay of 0.0667 s introduced by the frame rate. Figure 2 displays the mean time between samples averaged in three different runs considering an increasing number of ROIs. It shows that the addition of more mean depth value computations in other regions of the image does not impact the time interval between one sample and its consecutive. We have proved that increasing the number of ROIs up to 10 regions does not impact neither in the time interval between samples nor in the time complexity of the algorithm, but allows a synchronous multi-point assessment. In addition, variations on the size of the ROIs do not introduce a significant delay in the acquisition of samples. ",

The users were told to synchronize their breathing to a fixed-and known-frequency by using a simple metronome. The ages of the participants ranged from 21 to 66 years old with an average age of 34 years. All the participants provided their explicit consent. Each user was invited to stay at a mean distance about 1 m to the acquisition device. They were asked to face the camera-but not necessary looking directly towards it, remain still, and breathe according to the metronome during the measurements. The respiratory frequency tested was chosen randomly within the range of 12 to 25 bpm, making sure first that the selected rhythm was comfortable for each user. All the measurements were carried out indoors, but in different scenarios with a stable amount of light and during 60 s each. Nevertheless, as the acquisition itself relies on the depth module of the camera, no specific light conditions are required. Finally, no specific clothing requirements were asked to the users and no pre-selection of the users was performed. Table 1 shows the comparison of the mean BR obtained through the proposed algorithm within the whole acquisition timestamp and the original forced rate. Almost all of the user were measured twice for each of the proposed rates and three of them were asked to repeat the measurements at a different frequency value.",

As mentioned, the developed system measures the position of the ROIs with respect to the camera via the depth channel. The Ground Truth signal is obtained by the Biopac MP system and it is acquired by using a piezoelectric sensor attached to a band that is placed at the ROIs computed by the algorithm. The principle of acquisition is mostly the same as with the camera since the piezoelectric sensor also measures the movements of those regions, but with respect to the band. Nevertheless, although the principle is the same, we cannot assure the same waveform in both cases. Figure 7 shows a comparison between the waveform of the Ground Truth and the one obtained through the Video Signal in two different body regions. It shows that, although the waveform presents deviations in terms of amplitude, the temporal relation regarding the peaks of the signal is maintained. Therefore, the acquired signal could be compared to the Ground Truth via the BR that is obtained by computing the time between the peaks of the signal. Any other parameter relying on the time-domain information could be also computed. In this case, the BR is computed relying on the breath-by-breath information, but also by averaging the values within windows of 5 inhalation-exhalation cycles.",

Concretely, these representations show the difference between the BR obtained trough the Video Signal and the Ground Truth with respect to their mean values regarding the breath-by-breath information (Figure 9) , and also the averaged values ( Figure 10 ). Finally, the same BR information has been compared in terms of the mean value of each participant in the recorded periods of 60 s. Table 2 shows a comparison of the mean BR obtained through the proposed algorithm and the one computed considering the signal acquired by the system Biopac MP36 regarding the breath-by-breath information. Table 3 shows the same information, but for the averaged values in windows of 5 inhalationexhalation cycles. As could be observed in the results, two thoracic acquisitions were discarded due to periods of no acquisition within the considered timestamp, and three abdominal acquisitions were discarded because of a poorly acquired reference signal. We hypothesize that the periods of no acquisition occurred because of the saturation of the acquisition device, an unstable frame rate or even because of movement artifacts occluding the ROIs, while the problems with the reference signal are due to the sensor's position at the abdomen. Finally, to analyze the individual mean BR values obtained, the RMSE has been computed as in the first experiment. The acquisitions of this second experiment gave an overall RMSE of 0.21 breath/min in the breath-by-breath assessment and an overall RMSE of 0.13 breath/min in windows of 5 inhalation-exhalation cycles.

            "text": "The experimental results obtained by the proposed non-contact assessment of the respiratory function in different parts of the body with an algorithm achieving fixed-time complexity O(1) are comparable to those reported in the literature. In particular, we have found a non-statistically significant bias of 0.07 breaths/min and the 96% limits of agreement of \u22122.21 to 2.34 breaths/min in the breath-by-breath assessment of the thoracic region. Similarly, in the abdominal region, we have found a bias of 0.11 breaths/min and the 96% limits of agreement of \u22122.01 to 2.24 breaths/min. Regardless of the region, the breath-by-breath assessment shows a mean RMSE of 0.21 breaths/min. Both the presented 96% limits of agreement and the RMSE can be reduced by averaging the obtained values in consecutive inhalation-exhalation cycles. This could be also a valid approach to obtain smaller errors despite of losing real-time information. For example, if one considers a normal and stable BR of 16 breaths/min, the proposed algorithm could display the breathby-breath information every 3.75 s approximately in real-time as it should be the time between the last inhalation peak and its consecutive. In comparison, if one accesses the averaged information in two inhalation-exhalation cycles, a new value update will be resolved every 7.50 s with a smaller error. We have proved that the RMSE error could be reduced up to 0.13 breaths/min by considering five of those cycles. The presented results of the second experiment have been computed by comparing the acquired signal of the proposed system to the reference values obtained through the estimation performance of a medical device. Therefore, the accuracy has been experimentally quantified as the difference between the signal obtained by the proposed method and the reference one. We have found a maximum uncertainty of 2.34 breath/min in the real-time assessment, and that it can be reduced up to 1.22 breath/min if instead of estimating it for each respiratory cycle, an average of five cycles is considered. Finally, although the obtained error values in the two considered regions are similar, one should consider that some body regions present more mechanic movement than others as a result of the respiration when selecting the region under study, since the lack of movement will directly impact on the quality of the obtained results.",

            "text": "The novelty of the proposed method is to reduce the acquisition algorithm to a simple mean depth value computation of the target regions, getting rid of the processing of the traditional RGB channels that are prone to be more time-consuming. Instead, the Viola-Jones algorithm is applied to the RBG stream to locate the face of the user in the scene and automatically compute the regions in which the measurement is going to be performed according to the physiology of the user. Note that the main acquisition is performed just with the information of the depth channel, aside from the detection and location of the ROIs. Therefore, multiple ROIs can be added to the simultaneous measurement without altering the computational flow, and real-time values can be also registered. In this article, we have presented the results of the synchronous assessment of both the thoracic and abdominal regions. Nevertheless, these regions could be changed by direct modification of Equations (1)-(4) to assess the respiratory signal in any other part of the body. For example, the comparison of the left and right movements of the chest in order to see if there is an homogeneous expansion of the thorax could be also of medical interest. Experimental tests have validated that the developed system works correctly if the distance from the user to the camera is up to 1.5 m, where the background mask is applied. In fact, regardless of the background mask, the proposed method has shown similar accuracy values up to 2 m of distance between the user and the acquisition device. The measurements, by using the depth sensor, are less affected by changes in light intensity, so its use is possible in nonhospital environments. The most important factor for its operation is a correct recognition of the user's face, as the rest of the configuration parameters are automatically adjusted based on this first detection.",

            "text": "Regarding the state-of-the-art, several non-contact approaches have been proposed in the literature for the estimation of the respiratory function based on the movement of the body regions when breathing. Among others, Siam et al. extracted the respiratory function from the automatically detected chest region by using an IR camera with an averaged RMSE of 0.464 breaths/min [30] . However, no breath-by-breath information could be retrieved as the BR estimation was done by averaging the inhalation-exhalation cycles of the entire recordings. In addition, one single and static ROI was considered and the algorithm relied on the integral of the ROI instead of in the mean depth value. Massaroni et al. used a single RGB camera to extract the respiratory pattern from intensity variations of reflected light at the level of the collar bones and above the sternum [3] . In this case, they extracted breath-by-breath information with an error of 0.55 breaths/min as its best performance and 1.53 breaths/min in lower resolution, considering again one single and static region. In addition, they processed the three RGB channels individually, not being able to provide the assessment in real-time. Finally, Benetazzo et al. also proposed a method for extracting the respiratory pattern by means of a depth sensor in an automatically located chest region [29] . Nevertheless, a complex postprocessing of the signal was proposed for the extraction of the valuable information making impossible the real-time assessment. In addition, in this case, only one single and static ROI was considered at a time and the algorithm could not be externally modified to select the desired region, i.e., the monitoring could be only performed at the chest. Finally, our study overcomes by far the variety and number of users considered. In comparison, our proposed method achieves smaller errors and multi-point assessment due to the reduced complexity of processing one single depth channel. To our best knowledge, the non-contact and simultaneous multi-region estimation of the respiratory function directly implemented on the depth channel and using the RGB channels aside to adapt the algorithm to the user has not been proposed before. In addition, the errors obtained in both the breath-by-breath assessment and the averaged estimations make the proposed method suitable for remote health tracking as it overcomes the performance of the state-of-the-art algorithms.",

The respiratory function is estimated based on the breathing movement of those target regions with respect to the camera. Concretely, these movements are captured by the depth channel of an Intel Real Sense D435 camera. However, any other RGB-D camera-based technology with a depth module of the same characteristics and separate RGB channels could also be used. The non-contact and simultaneous multi-region estimation, up to 10 ROIs, of the respiratory function directly implemented on the depth channel, using the RGB channels aside to adapt the algorithm to the user is newly proposed in this work. A first experiment has been conducted for validation purposes considering different scenarios, different body poses and body types (body sizes and skin tones), physical conditions and clothing, already giving competent results regarding the state-of-the-art. In addition, a more accurate second experiment has been performed to closely compare the acquired signal to the reference one regarding both breath-by-breath and averaged assessments. The errors obtained in both the breath-bybreath assessment, from \u22122.21 to 2.34 breaths/min in the worst case, and the averaged estimations, from \u22121.22 to 1.18 breaths/min in the worst case, make the proposed method suitable for remote health tracking. The overall RMSE errors of 0.21 breaths/min in the breath-by-breath assessment and 0.13 breaths/min in the averaged estimation also overcome the state-of-the-art performances. The proposed system enables breath monitoring in static situations using a highly accurate and low-cost system, which makes it suitable for non-hospital applications and periodic monitoring of respiratory function.

The real-time values have similar biases regarding the thoracic and abdominal measures while the \u00b196% limits of agreement are roughly between \u00b12 breaths/min. By averaging the obtained values in 5 cycles, the limits of agreement get reduced to almost \u00b11 breath/min.
