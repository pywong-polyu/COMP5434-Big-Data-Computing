Five end-point PCR assays and ten real-time quantitative PCR assays targeting various genes associated with Bacteroidales were used. Of the five endpoint PCR assays, HF183 and HumM19 primer sets proved to be most useful with specificity values of 95%, prevalence in sewage of 100%, and clinical sensitivity greater than 10%. The term clinical sensitivity, defined as the percentage of samples known to contain the target and resulting in a positive amplification, is used here to differentiate it from detection sensitivity. In the case of this study, samples containing 1x10 -4 ng of target DNA per reaction was used to determine the clinical sensitivity. Of the ten quantitative PCR assays tested, the HF183, BsteriF1, and HumM2 primer sets produced results that met the following criteria: a limit of quantification greater than 25 gene copies, a prevalence in sewage samples of greater than 99%, a mean percent coefficient of variation across the range of quantification less than 5%, and a high target abundance of genetic markers. In a similar study from the same group, seven end-point PCR and quantitative PCR assays known to be associated with ruminant or bovine fecal contamination of water targeting Bacteroidales genetic markers were evaluated for suitability in field studies (Shanks et al. 2010a ). These assays were tested against DNA extracts from 247 bovine fecal samples and 175 fecal samples from other animals.",

It was Water Environment Research, Volume 83, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2011 Water Environment Federation determined that at least one enteric virus was present in nearly all sewage and river samples. Because of the low infectious dose, this is particularly problematic in developing countries. A method for distinguishing between infectious and noninfectious human enteric viruses in water samples was developed. A key strength of the method employed was the use of propidium monoazide in conjunction with reverse transcriptase PCR (Parshionikar et al. 2010 showed that out of 100 samples, 18% were positive with endpoint RT-PCR while 20% were positive with real-time RT-PCR.

This microscope uses a light emitting diode to vertically illuminate the sample. The sample was imaged by a low-cost lens-less complementary metal oxide semiconductor detector, which forms holograms of the cysts/oocysts. These holograms were digitally transferred to a computer for the reconstruction of images. In this experiment, G. lamblia and C. parvum particles were fixed on glass slides with 5 % formalin (pH 7.4) and imaged by the microscope. The field of view of this microscope was ~24 mm 2 with a detection limit of less than 400 particles per mL. As these holograms can be acquired by cell phone cameras and can also be transferred to a central computer for processing, this device has a potential for pathogen diagnosis in resource-limited settings.

After an incubation period of 6 h at 37 o C, the slide was imaged by fluorescence microscopy to confirm the aggregation. This immunofluorescent aggregation assay had a limit of detection of 10 3 CFU per mL. Enrichment broth of 146 estuarine water samples was tested. This assay was compared against conventional culture method and real-time PCR. The percent positive result by the immunofluorescent aggregation assay, conventional culture method, and real-time PCR was 19.9%, 10.3%, and 29.5% respectively. Water Environment Research, Volume 83, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2011 Water Environment Federation In another study, a multiplex bead-based assay was designed for the detection of immunoglobulin G antibodies for G. intestinalis and C. parvum (Priest et al. 2010). Variant-specific surface protein sequences recognized by immunoglobulin G antibodies were identified and applied for their detection from stool samples. More specifically, 3 fragments of variant-specific surface protein from assemblage B strains and \u03b1-1 giardin structural antigen for Giardia and recombinant 17-and 27-kDa antigens for Cryptosporidium were used. Approximately 60% of giardiasis outbreak samples were positive by targeting multiple Giardia antigens, while less than 12% non-outbreak samples and cryptosporidiosis outbreak samples were also positive. Approximately 40% of cryptosporidiosis outbreak samples were detected by targeting 17-and 27-kDa antigens, while less than 10% of non-outbreak samples and giardiasis outbreak samples were positive. Immunoassays were developed on nano-fibers for the detection of E. coli O157:H7 and bovine viral diarrhea virus (Luo et al. 2010). Nanofibers were fabricated with nitrocellulose by an electrospinning process, functionalized with antibodies, and directly used for the detection. Nanofibers were treated with oxygen plasma to enhance the flow of solution in nanofibers by capillary action. Antibody attachment and pathogen binding was confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. The sensor showed a linear response for different E. coli O157:H7 concentrations ranging from 0 to 10 4 CFU per mL. This biosensor was highly rapid (8 min) with a limit of detection of 61 CFU per mL and 10 3 cell culture infective dose per mL for bacterial and viral samples, respectively. A graphene-oxide-based sandwich immunobiosensor was developed for the detection of rotavirus (Jung et al. 2010). Presence of rotavirus was confirmed by observing the fluorescence quenching by fluorescence resonance energy transfer process between the grapheneoxide and gold nanoparticles. The antibodies for rotavirus were immobilized on the graphene-oxide array. Goldnanoparticles were attached with antibodies by using 100mer single stranded DNA chains. The short DNA chains controlled the distance between antibodies, gold nanoparticles, and the graphene-oxide surface. The fluorescence emission of the graphene-oxide was quenched upon binding of antibody-DNA-gold nanoparticle complex with the rotavirus, enabling the detection of target cells.",

Upon slight increasing of the temperature, a top micelle-poor phase and a bottom micelle-rich phase were formed, due to phase change in the solution. Due to the three interactions, namely repulsive, stearic, and excludedvolume, between M13 particles and micelles, a selective partitioning of M13 was obtained towards the micelle-poor phase. Including this concentration step before lateral-flow immunoassay, the limit of detection was improved by 10fold from 5\u00d710 8 to 5\u00d710 7 PFU per mL.An integrated flow-through immune-magnetic separation system was developed for the recovery of Giardia cysts and Cryptosporidium oocysts spiked in large volumes (10 L) of tap water, secondary effluent water, and purified water(Ramadan et al. 2010). Periodically arranged rotating magnets along the fluidic channels (containing magnetic particle suspension) were applied to allow the alternate trapping and release of particles during the recovery cycle. Microfluidic channels were fabricated in glass and a low-cost polycarbonate material. The performance of this system was compared with a commercial magnetic bead-based isolation instrument (magnetic tube holder). Experimental protocols of the U.S Environmental Protection Agency Method 1623 were applied to detect the cells after the recovery process. The recovery efficiencies for Giardia cysts from tap water with the flow-through system and commercial system were 90.1% and 90.5% respectively. From secondary effluent samples the recovery efficiencies from the flow-through system and commercial system were 18.5% and 31%respectively. The recovery efficiencies for Cryptosporidium oocysts with the flow-through system and commercial system were 83.3% and 90% respectively, from tap water, and 36% and 38%, respectively, from secondary effluentsamples. Lower recovery efficiencies of cells from the secondary effluent samples were due to the presence of high concentration of sand particles, which might have influenced the binding of cells with the functionalized nanoparticles. Recovery efficiencies from all the samples (with the flow-through system) were higher in glass channels in comparison to polycarbonate channels. The non-smooth walls of plastic channels in comparison to smooth walls of glass might have caused the adherence of cells, reducing the recovery efficiency in polycarbonate flow-through channels. Although the recovery efficiency of this flow-through system was comparable or slightly lower than the commercial system, the primary benefit of this method was the rapid and automated recovery of pathogens from high sample volumes. Filtration performances of four types of membranes, Anodisc \u00ae membrane filters, silver membrane filters, and gold-coated polycarbonate track etched membrane were evaluated to assess the concentration of G. lamblia cysts in drinking water (Wigginton & Vikesland Water Environment Research, Volume 83, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2011 Water Environment Federation 2010). After the filtration, the cysts were directly labeled with gold nanoparticles conjugated with antibodies and detected with Raman spectroscopy. It was found that the gold-coated polycarbonate track etched membrane was the most efficient in the recovery (~95%) and detection of G.lamblia compared to the other applied membranes.A coagulation-sand filtration process was developed for the removal of recombinant norovirus-like particles (morphologically and antigenically similar to noroviruses) from river water(Shirasaki et al. 2010).Performance of this process for the removal of two surrogates for waterborne viruses (Q\u03b2 and MS2), were also investigated for the comparison with recombinant norovirus-like particles. Three log orders of removals were observed for recombinant norovirus-like particles with 40 mM aluminum chloride at pH 6.8, or ferric chloride at pH 5.8, respectively. Lower percentage of removal of recombinant norovirus-like particles was observed with alum and ferric chloride at pH 6.8. Removal percentage of MS2 was higher than that of recombinant norovirus-like particles in the coagulation-sand filtration process.Removal percentage of Q\u03b2 was similar than that of recombinant norovirus-like particles. However, a high difference in the removal performance of Q\u03b2 was observed between the coagulation process and the sand filtration process. Therefore, none of the surrogates were recommended for norovirus removal by coagulation-sand filtration process.",

The heat-inactivated (at 72\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C) and chemically-inactivated (hypochlorite treatment) virus samples were noninfectious and did not interfere with the detection of the infectious samples. The method could not identify the noninfectious viruses that were inactivated at 19\u00b0C. Because the developed method proved adequate in the majority of the cases, it was concluded that it could be used in the environment to differentiate between potentially infectious and noninfectious viruses. The efficiency between endpoint and real-time RT-PCR were compared for use in detecting and quantifying noroviruses (Anbazhagi & Kamatchiammal 2010). Noroviruses are responsible for acute gastroenteritis caused by contaminated drinking water. Utilizing activated carbon, 100 samples were collected and concentrated for norovirus. The RT-PCR reactions used N1 and E3 primers previously designed for noroviruses. The real-time PCR reactions used a SYBR-Green RT-PCR kit. The results",

The hydrophobic surface of polydimethylsiloxane was passivated by adding detergent (0.1% Triton X-100) into the reaction solution. A low-cost real time analyzer made with light emitting diode and a charge coupled device camera was used for capturing the amplification signal simultaneously from the 9-reaction channels each having a volume of 5 \u00b5L. Virulence genes of 5 major waterborne pathogens were validated on this chip including, Aeromonas hydrophila, Klebsiella pneumonia, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and E. coli. The lower limit of detection for E. coli uidA gene was approximately 51 CFU per mL. Results showed that limit of detection and quantitative values were in high agreement with those obtained using a commercial real-time PCR instrument (RotorGene 3000). Evaporative losses on these unsealed microchannels were also evaluated with respect to the length of bridge channels (channels connecting the input/output wells to the reaction wells). Due to the application of capillary flow of reaction solution, applications of expensive pumps, valves, and liquid handling instruments were eliminated.",

These gold nanorods were immobilized with polyclonal antibodies specific to E. coli O157: H7.per mL without any prior enrichment step and 2.3 CFU per mL with enrichment step. This sensor was also evaluated with 265 water samples, 340 beef samples, 208 milk Water Environment Research, Volume 83, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2011 Water Environment Federation samples and 120 cake samples after enrichment providing a specificity of 99.2, 97.9, 94.6 and 94.9%, for each sample type respectively. Clinical sensitivity was 100% and a strong agreement was observed with traditional culture method. Detection time was only 10 min.A gold nanoparticle-based electrochemical immune-detection method was developed for the detection of E. coli in water. Based on the sandwich immunoassay, E. coli cells were detected by H 2 O 2 electroreduction current catalyzed by horseradish peroxidase (labeled on anti-E. coli antibody) which was measured amperometrically. Detection limit of this sensor was 20 CFU per mL. After including a pre-enrichment step, a limit of detection of 2 CFU per mL was achieved.In a study, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy in combination with gold-active substrates was used to detect seven viruses including, norovirus, adenovirus, parvovirus, rotavirus, coronavirus, paramyxovirus, and herpersvirus(Fan et al. 2010). Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy spectral patterns were further analyzed by soft independent modeling of class analogy and principal component analysis, to discriminate these viruses. Softindependent modeling of class analogy allowed the differentiation of enveloped and non-enveloped viruses with and accuracy greater than 95%. Principal component analysis allowed to specifically segregate the spectral data from different viral strains. This sensor had a limit of detection of 100 viral particles per mL. In addition the results showed that the viral particles needed to be diluted in deionized water to minimize the background signals.Another immunoassay-based detection platform using surface-enhanced Raman scattering for E. coli was proposed(Temur et al. 2010). Two different types of gold nanoparticles (citrate-stabilized gold nanospheres and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide-stabilized gold nanorods) were examined in this study. The analytical performance of this sandwich immuno-assay showed linearity for different concentrations of E. coli ranging from 10 to 10 5 CFU per mL. The total analysis time was 70 min.A rapid and sensitive assay for E. coli O157:H7 was developed by using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry was used for trace element analysis (inorganic particles) and provides large dynamic range, low limit of detection, and multiplexing capability. In this case, a monoclonal antibody for E. coli O157:H7 was conjugated with gold nanoparticles (10-nm diameter). Detection of gold nanoparticles by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry provided quantitative analysis of the bacterial cells. As this technique probes elemental ions (10 nm diameter gold particle will have ~30,000 gold atoms), detection signal could be enhanced by 30,000-fold. Due to the signal amplification property of gold nanoparticles, and the high sensitivity of inductively coupled plasma mass Water Environment Research, Volume 83, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2011 Water Environment Federation spectrometry, limit of detection of 500 CFU per mL was obtained. This assay was also tested against non-pathogenic E. coli (DH5r, \u0391\u03a4CC35218, and ATCC25922) and showed high specificity for E. coli O157:H7. The total detection time was 40 min.O1(Sungkanak et al. 2010). Monoclonal anti-V. cholerae O1 antibodies were immobilized on gold-coated cantilevers by self-assembled monolayer preparation method.Resonance frequency shift of the cantilever was measured and correlated with the amount of attached V. cholerae O1 on its surface. A linear relationship between the resonance frequency shift of the cantilever and the log of cell concentration was obtained for cell concentrations ranging from 1\u00d710 3 to 1\u00d710 7 CFU per mL. The limit of detection of this sensor was approximately 1x10 3 CFU per mL with a mass sensitivity of ~146.5 pg/Hz. Specificity of this sensor was tested against 1\u00d710 8 CFU per mL of V.parahemolyticus, which showed a negligible (24 Hz) shift in resonance frequency as compared to 1100 Hz for 1\u00d710 6 CFU per mL of V. cholerae O1.",

At low tide and elevated solar conditions, microorganisms were more susceptible to desiccation and solar inactivation.The impact of fecal indicator organism density in beach sand was determined by characterizing the sand, hydrologic and beach factors of three beaches of Lake Michigan(Skalbeck et al. 2010). E. coli densities in beach sand increased when the grain diameter decreased and the uniformity increased. Wave movement was the main transport mechanism and groundwater beneath the beaches was not a transport mechanism for E. coli to surface water.The evaluation of beach profiles suggested that the increase in gradient (steeper slopes) would decrease E. coli concentration in beach sands. This would prevent continual wetting which, along with the sand characteristics, may provide a reservoir for replication and persistence of E. coli. Beach management interventions suggested were deep mechanical grooming of fine sand beaches and beach slope assessments. Hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) naturally occurring in fresh and oceanic waters may affect FIB concentrations. It has been reported that there was an inverse relationship between H 2 O 2 and FIB in seawater (Clark et al. 2010). In this study, H 2 O 2 concentrations in the surf zone were taken on both short and long time scales for bathing beaches in Southern California. Hydrogen peroxide concentrations ranged from 100 to 300 nM with maximum concentrations occurring in the afternoon. Coastal and natural lake water samples showed inhibition of bacteria when concentrations of H 2 O 2 were as low as 100 nM. These results confirm that the presence of H 2 O 2 results in lower concentrations of FIB in seawater. Therefore, this study may have implications in the reductions of FIB in the surf zones of recreational bathing waters.

In addition, the highest level of antibiotic resistance bacteria were found in the middle part of the beach and the dune, while the lowest was found at the clindamycin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, and penicillin were related to the highest resistance frequency. The majority of the isolated bacteria were resistant to only one antibiotic out of 18 tested in the study. However on humanimpacted recreational beaches the majority of the isolated bacteria were resistant to 3 to 8 antibiotics. It was suggested that human activity may have contributed to multiple resistances.Another study examined the antibiotic resistance of bacteria isolated from recreational beaches with three different levels of organic pollution in southeastern Brazil(de Oliveira et al. 2010). These beaches were rated as poor quality, suitable for swimming and bathing, and excellent quality beaches. For the poor water quality beach, 72% of isolated bacteria were resistant to one antibiotic while 8.3%were resistant to multiple antibiotics. At this beach, for wet sand, the highest frequency of resistance was for penicillin, erythromycin, amoxicillin, vancomycin, rifampicin, and ampicillin. For dry sand, the highest frequency of resistance was for penicillin, vancomycin, and ciprofloxacin. For the beach suitable for swimming and bathing, 70.8% of the isolated bacteria were resistant to one antibiotic while 6.9% had multiple resistances. For wet sand at this beach, the highest resistance was to penicillin, ciprofloxacin, amoxicillin, and ampicillin, while for dry sand it was penicillin and ciprofloxacin. At the beach with excellent water quality, 35.8% of isolated bacteria were resistant to one antibiotic and there were no multiple resistances observed. For both wet and dry sand, the only antibiotic resistance was to penicillin. The level of contamination correlated to the frequency of the bacterial antibiotic resistance from wet and dry sand samples.Occurrence of FIB and pathogens. Studieswere conducted to analyze FIB concentrations during rainfall events in several headwater tidal creeks in North Carolina (Stumpf et al. 2010). It was observed that concentrations of FIBs increased during storm events for all the creeks tested. The concentrations of E. coli and enterococci increased 30 and 37 times respectively, when Water Environment Research, Volume 83, Number 10-Copyright \u00a9 2011 Water Environment Federation compared to dry weather concentrations. In another study conducted on the Kalamazoo River, Michigan, FIB concentrations were persistently high with E. coli having a significantly higher load compared to E. feacalis at downstream locations (Olapade & Weage 2010). Factors for the high concentrations of FIB included direct waste load from animals, waste effluents, the type of stream sediment, and riparian vegetation. Occurrence of E. coli was examined by collecting and analyzing samples from six locations at an urban watershed in Houston, Texas (Desai & Rifai 2010). It was observed that E. coli concentrations were relatively lower at upstream grassland sites (up to 715 MPN per 100 ml) compared to urbanized downstream sites (up to 7005 MPN per 100 ml). In another study, wetlands were constructed in the San Joaquin Valley, California, in order to reduce the bacterial load from irrigation runoffs. The concentrations of E. coli and enterococci were reduced by 76 % and 89 % respectively, between inflow and outflow",

It was noted that Enterococcus and fecal coliform counts were low in some samples whereas pathogens were constantly detected, with a limit of detection of 1 CFU per 100 mL. Statistical analyses showed that both Enterococcus and fecal coliforms positively but non-significantly correlated the presence of pathogens. Therefore, it was concluded these indicators need to be considered together to correlate the occurrence of the pathogens. fecal indicators. Traditional FIB tracking is known to have several limitations including replication in the environment. Search for alternative indicators is an ongoing effort and a number of emerging and new alternative indicators have been proposed.Bacteroidales 16S rRNA gene markers, that is one of the well-known alternative indicators were used in a study conducted on surface waters in California(Schriewer et al. 2010). Surface waters were analyzed for the presence of pathogens (Salmonella spp., Campylobacter spp., Vibrio spp., and protozoal pathogens), FIBs, and universal and human Bacteroidales markers using quantitative PCR.Weighted measurement analysis was used to compare the Bacteroidales marker to the FIBs for predicting the presence of pathogens. Results indicated that the universal Bacteroidales genetic markers performed better than traditional FIBs for predicting pathogens, as they were detected in 100% and 75-99% of the samples respectively. Also, host specific Bacteroidales markers gave additional information related to the source of fecal contamination.Another study compared the decay rates of three Bacteroidales 16S rRNA genetic markers to E. coli in wastewater under different treatment conditions of artificial sunlight, reduced predation, reduced temperature, and sediment exposure(Dick et al. 2010). The human fecal associated markers were seen to decay at the same rate or faster than E. coli in all the treatments. Therefore, human fecal-associated Bacteroidales markers could be used along with E. coli as indicators for human fecal pollution.
