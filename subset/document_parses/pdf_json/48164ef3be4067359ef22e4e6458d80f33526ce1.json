However, there is a need to better understand the overall impact of these interventions in improving cancer care and to identify best practices to support intervention adoption. Overall, this review intended to systematically catalogue the recent body of cancer-based mHealth and eHealth education and training interventions and assess the effectiveness of these interventions in increasing health care professionals' knowledge, confidence, and behaviors related to the delivery of care along the cancer continuum. Our initial search yielded 135 articles, and our full review included 23 articles. We abstracted descriptive data for each of the 23 studies, including an overview of interventions (i.e., intended intervention recipients, location of delivery, topic of focus), study methods (i.e., design, sampling approach, sample size), and outcome measures. Almost all the studies reported knowledge gain as an outcome of the education interventions, whereas only half assessed provider confidence or behavior change. We conclude that there is some evidence that mHealth and eHealth interventions lead to improvements in cancer care delivery, but this is not a consistent finding across the studies reviewed. Our findings also identify gaps that should be addressed in future research, offer guidance on the utility of mHealth and eHealth interventions, and provide a roadmap for addressing these gaps.",

Most prior reviews on eHealth interventions have focused broadly on noncommunicable diseases or generally on professional education. The systematic review by Campbell et al. [8] was cancer specific but only evaluated the effectiveness of online cancer education for nurses and allied professionals. Others reviewed the effectiveness of mHealth approaches for noncommunicable disease (NCD) care but focused only in low-and middle-income countries [9, 10] or broadly explored components of eHealth (including mHealth) effectiveness regarding NCD management [11] [12] [13] . Still, no systematic review currently addresses cancer-specific eHealth and mHealth education and training interventions, and this limits our understanding of the effectiveness of these interventions for improving cancer care delivery. Cancer has many diseasespecific aspects, including screening, early detection, and diagnostic processes and a multitude of technologies to support these processes. This review intended to systematically catalogue the recent body of cancer-based mHealth and eHealth education and training interventions and assess the effectiveness of these mHealth interventions in increasing health care professionals' knowledge, confidence, and behaviors related to the delivery of care along the cancer continuum. Findings from this review can offer guidance on the utility of mHealth and eHealth interventions and provide a roadmap for addressing gaps in the literature.",

The search drew from three databases (PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science). Key search terms included mHealth, cancer, or noncommunicable disease, chronic disease terms, training, and healthcare provider. Although our initial search strategy included noncommunicable disease and chronic disease terms, we eliminated these terms after the search yielded a higher number of results than anticipated. The final search focused on cancer mHealth trainings. The full search strategy is in Appendix A. Because the field of mHealth is rapidly evolving, we restricted our search to studies published from 2010 to 2020. Only articles available in English were included, and no geographic parameters were applied. Two reviewers independently assessed titles/abstracts then reviewed full-text articles, extracted relevant data, and assessed study quality. Articles were included if they presented evaluations of mHealth or eHealth approaches to train health care workers who provide cancer care. Articles were excluded if they did not focus on cancer, described intervention development only (i.e., no evaluation), focused on pediatric care, or included an evaluation limited to satisfaction assessment or if a full article could not be retrieved (i.e., only an abstract available). Review articles were also excluded.",

Among studies that measured change in knowledge within a group (n = 7), six reported statistical significance with change in mean knowledge scores ranging from 4 to 24%. Among studies that measured change in mean knowledge scores between groups (intervention vs. control; n = 6), four reported at least some statistically significant difference in knowledge between intervention and control participants immediately after the intervention. However, the one study that measured change 12 months post-intervention found that this difference was not sustained. Of the four studies that reported other methods of measuring knowledge (increased perceived knowledge, high agreement rates between trainees and experts, increased diagnostic accuracy in a simulated patient encounter, median improvement in knowledge scores), two reported a statistically significant change in knowledge outcomes.",

We identified a total of 23 studies that met the study inclusion criteria. Almost all the studies reported knowledge gain as an outcome of the education interventions, whereas only half assessed provider confidence or behavior change. The majority of the studies with behavior outcomes reported statistically significant improvement but behavior change exhibited wide variation with a range from 4 to 24% among studies that reported percentage change based on assessments before and after the education intervention. Several studies also reported statistically significant changes in confidence levels and self-reported behavior, but there were also multiple studies that did not find the intervention to be effective. Similar to knowledge change, there was variation in the behavior change proportions, from 1 to 20%, among studies that reported percentage differences. Overall, we can conclude that there is some evidence that eHealth interventions lead to improvements in cancer care delivery, but this is not a consistent finding across the studies reviewed. Almost 80% (18/23) of the interventions were delivered via online courses, and the remaining 20% were a blend of online and in-person education. The studies presented in this review do not offer clear insight as to whether multimodal approaches are more effective than stand-alone ones. There is evidence from other settings that the use of multimodal education methods can make teaching more effective [36, 37] . Additional studies in the future could compare combinations of approaches and methods to support evidencebased decisions on the selection of multimodal interventions. Furthermore, evidence on the role of mHealth interventions was limited, with only one study using SMS messaging, and we did not identify any systematic assessments of education apps. Cancer education apps like those created by the American Society of Clinical Oncology for self-evaluation do exist, but there may not be formal evaluations of the effectiveness of these tools in the peer-reviewed literature.",

Almost all the studies identified for this review report on evaluations conducted in high-income settings. The paucity of research in the low-and middle-income settings is an important finding from this review. Mortality from cancer remains high in limited-resource settings, and it is projected that the burden from cancer will grow in low-and middle-income countries [39, 40] . There is an urgent need to improve knowledge among providers to prevent, screen, diagnose, and treat cancers, and therefore, more research is needed in lowresource settings to create the evidence base on optimal education interventions [41, 42] .",

First, behavior change was only addressed in a small number of studies, and all studies except one used self-reported behavior measurement. The ultimate objective of all education interventions is to foster optimal use of guideline-recommended cancer care. As such, intervention evaluations should include reports of observation-based behavior measurement. Second, studies generally reported changes immediately after the intervention was delivered, and there is a need for longer-term assessments to evaluate the sustainability of the impact of the education delivered. Third, no study included in this review conducted a costeffectiveness assessment of the interventions to provide guidance for the adoption of the approaches studied. The importance of systematic economic evaluations has been highlighted in a prior review [8] , and this is an important omission that should be addressed in future research. Fourth, the overall quality of the studies in this field should be improved. Our review assigned a high-quality rating to only about one-third of the studies included in this manuscript. Fifth, our experience compiling the findings for this review reveals the importance of fostering consistent terminology, outcome measures, and metrics to pool the results from eHealth studies consistently. We acknowledge that it might not always be feasible to implement consistent reporting because the education interventions and the target audience differs but nevertheless attempts at reaching an agreement on standardized measures will be extremely important to generate collaborative evidence to support the field.",

            "text": "This review has several limitations that should be considered when interpreting the findings. A key drawback is that outcome measures are not always reported consistently in the manuscripts reviewed, and this makes it difficult to synthesize the findings to reach concrete conclusions. Some of the differences in the selection of measures could be the variation in the type of education tested, but nevertheless, a more uniform approach would be useful. Our review was also limited to cancer, and there may be lessons to learn from the delivery of other chronic and noncommunicable conditions. Furthermore, we only included studies published in English, and the review team also decided to exclude pediatric-focused physician education because these studies were on specific issues that are likely not generalizable to the population as a whole. eHealth and mHealth technology are rapidly progressing in terms of content displays, interactive graphics and other tools, and virtual reality training approaches. Therefore, although we included all manuscripts published as of early 2020, the field will continue to evolve.",

In general, our results indicate some evidence toward the positive impact of mHealth interventions on provider knowledge but insufficient findings regarding the impact on provider behavior. Findings from the studies currently available in the literature vary widely regarding the use of eHealth to improve provider delivery of cancer care, which highlights the need for additional methodologically rigorous studies with longer-term follow-up. An essential recommendation from our analysis is the need for consistent terminology, measures, and metrics to synthesize results from the studies efficiently, which will build the evidence base required to adopt optimal and cost-effect ive i nterventions. Generalizability of the findings is an additional concern and future studies will ideally evaluate eHealth and mHealth education interventions in a wide variety of settings, including those in low-and middle-income countries.",
