Aims The aim of this study was to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) of hand hygiene in a sample of medical students in Ireland and members of the public to evaluate these within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. We also explored any differences between the two groups. Methods A 35-question survey was formulated and circulated to potential participants comprising Irish medical students and members of the public. The data was analysed using Microsoft Excel with P-values being calculated using chi-squared goodness-of-fit analysis. Results There were 356 responses to the survey, categorised into medical students and general public populations. Incomplete surveys were removed leaving 303 responses. There was no statistical difference between the groups for attitudes and selfreported practices towards hand hygiene. Statistical differences were found between the two groups in terms of knowledge. Conclusions The study showed that medical students and the public had a good knowledge base and positive attitude in regards to hand hygiene. Both groups displayed consensus that the practices are essential, especially within the current pandemic context. However, larger studies, involving multiple universities and a larger portion of the public, may be useful to ascertain whether there is a true difference in the KAP between healthcare students and the general public.",

It is recognised as an important, and at the same time simple and cost-effective, measure that individuals can take to interrupt the spread of communicable diseases [2] .

Additionally, the public cohorts were accessed via social media networks including WhatsApp and Twitter.

In contrast, there have been recent studies comparing cohorts within the medical profession. A study by Kingston et al. in 2018 looked at attitudes towards hand hygiene in a hospital setting between nursing students and medical students. In accordance with the results of our study, it also showed a general positive outlook on hand hygiene within both groups [4] . The nursing students had a greater hand hygiene compliance compared to medical students; however, there was suboptimal compliance overall. A study in Saudi Arabia assessed hand hygiene knowledge and compliance amongst undergraduate medical students during their clinical phase of training using the WHO's \"Five Moments for Hand Hygiene\". Compliance was measured during OSCE sessions and only 29% were able to correctly identify all five indications for hand hygiene, indicating a poor knowledge base. Compliance was found to be equally as poor at 17% [5] , differing from our study, which had medical students displaying a good knowledge based on hand hygiene. A cross-sectional study in India evaluated hand hygiene knowledge, attitude, and practice amongst medical and nursing students using a WHO hand hygiene questionnaire. In contrast to our study, only 9% of participants had good knowledge regarding hand hygiene. Nursing students knowledge (P = 0.023) and attitude (P < 0.05) were significantly better than medical students. A German study reported on the beliefs of medical students regarding hand hygiene during their first clinical year in a hospital setting [8] . Overall, only 21% (18/85) of medical students marked all of the indications for hand hygiene correctly, whilst 67% identified WHO's \"Five Moments for Hand Hygiene\". A UK study found that 58% of medical students were unaware of correct indications for alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) and half of the students reported a perceived lack of teaching on infection control and hand hygiene during their education [9] . These studies suggested a lack of knowledge concerning hand hygiene indications amongst medical students and differed from the results of our study pertaining to medical students' knowledge.",

            "text": "The knowledge that the public had on hand hygiene was almost equivalent to that of a medical student, possibly due to public health efforts made globally to raise hand hygiene awareness. Nonetheless, there remains a slight gap in knowledge amongst the two groups. This was signified by the responses between the two groups when asked if removing watches and bracelets is required during hand washing. Of the public group 71% (n = 135) answered correctly whilst 94.69% (n = 98) of the medical student participants answered correctly (P < 0.05). These results show that although global awareness of hand hygiene has increased, work remains to further close the gap regarding best practice.",

It was interesting to note that there was a relatively significant preference for soap as opposed to alcohol hand gel. This might be attributed to knowledge from both groups or rather the experience of drying effects of some hand gel products. Both groups have actively started to practice hand hygiene more than they used to before COVID-19. Local efforts to reduce transmission of COVID-19 were welcomed by both groups. Of the public participants, 97.36% (n = 185) and 98.23% (n = 111) medical student participants would like to see all stores and supermarkets continue to provide complementary use of alcohol-based hand sanitisers in the future.",

            "text": "Although reported attitudes were very positive towards hand hygiene, this did not always translate into reported practices. For example only 33.6% (n = 38) of medical students and 42.7% (n = 79) of the public participants always wash their hands after removing their mask. Lack of hand washing after handshaking was also noted with 32.6% (n = 33) of medical students and 35.2% (n = 54) of the public indicating that they always washed their hands after handshaking. However, this might be attributed to the fact that since the COVID-19 pandemic, handshaking has been dispensed of in favour of elbow touching or equivalent. Only 60.3% (n = 67) of medical students and 55.3% (n = 103) of the public always washed their hands after coughing; this was notable as transmission through hands and coughing is known to be associated with transmission of infectious illnesses [11] . Improving compliance with hand hygiene was explored in a recent systematic review of hand hygiene interventions in a clinical setting. It noted that single and multi-modal strategies can achieve a modest-to-moderate improvement in hand hygiene compliance amongst healthcare staff, with net effectiveness of interventions decreasing where baseline compliance was already high. Less information was available on longer term changes in compliance. Reasons for non-adherence with hand hygiene included skin irritation with ABHR, habituation, and staff workload [12] .",

We could thus evaluate if there is a similar focus on hand hygiene as the global impact of COVID-19 decreases. With the ongoing global vaccination underway for COVID-19, it would be interesting to examine the influence that being vaccinated has on hand washing as well. Another area to explore would be a comparative analysis between different populations of healthcare workers, which might help to show any discrepancies in hand hygiene, and where additional measures and training are needed. Similarly, the desire for face masks going forward both within and outside of the healthcare setting could be evaluated to understand the needs/ wants of various populations in a COVID-19 free world.",
