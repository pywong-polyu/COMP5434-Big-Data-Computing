Hundreds of patients were diagnosed as affected by COVID-19 in Italy's northern regions, where the pandemic first hit, and the figures are probably underestimated, due to the low availability of tests, especially during the first phase of the epidemic. For example, in two of the of the largest renal units in Milan, near the epicenter of the Italian epidemic, where 330 hemodialysis (HD) patients and 50 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are followed, we tried to reduce exposure and the risk of contagion by decreasing the number of patients per shift in order to provide safe distance between patients during hemodialysis. To do so, we rapidly equipped additional treatment space with ten hemodialysis stations and added dialysis shifts. However, this led to staff shortages, which were already critical as members of the health care team had been infected. Although new stations were added, treatment time had to be shortened wherever clinically possible. In our Unit, 20 HD and 1 PD patient were diagnosed as having COVID-19 and 5 died.",

Now that the epidemic is reaching a plateau, it is time to reflect on the lessons that could, and probably should transform our models of delivering dialysis. Outpatient, thriceweekly hemodialysis is the standard of care in most countries, including Italy; dialysis delivery is often, probably too often, performed in a standardized way, and the population of mainly elderly and high-comorbidity patients often passively receives this intrusive, albeit life-sustaining treatment.",

This mediation further highlights how an incremental dialysis strategy, based on number of sessions as well as their duration, can be safe and patient-friendly Delivering supplies may prove difficult to organize during lockdown; technical aid may be delayed. Home dialysis has to be a clear priority for technical aid and delivery of disposables for many subjects with some residual kidney function [6] . During an epidemic incremental approaches play an important role in limiting exposure; implementing the lessons in times of less pressure could lead to a personalized approach that limits morbidity, respects residual kidney function and minimizes iatrogenic impact. However, tailoring dialysis can be time consuming, and requires frequent monitoring. If on the one hand this could be seen as too demanding for overcrowded dialysis wards, the spare time for the patient and cost for the society could theoretically be reinvested in dedicated physician's time ( Table 1 ). The issue of personalized incremental dialysis is intrinsically linked with home dialysis, in both HD and PD. The present epidemic has highlighted some of the limits of standard, thrice-weekly outpatient hemodialysis: it lacks flexibility, and large units are often preferred, given their economies of scale [7, 8] .",

First of all, they offer the opportunity to manage patients remotely, thus reducing contagion during an epidemic. The French health council, as well as some patients' associations, recently underlined the importance of developing home dialysis choices to respond to the COVID crisis. Home dialysis involves making patients responsible for their own care and patient empowerment facilitates personalization of treatment. In this regard, the Advancing American Kidney Health Initiative (AAKHI) underlines that home dialysis should be promoted as an opportunity for patients to be engaged in their own treatment. Flexibility applies not only to dialysis itself, but also to diet and, more widely, to lifestyle. The list of advantages of home dialysis is long and encompasses better preservation of residual kidney function, at least in PD and incremental hemodialysis, saving time, limiting travel from center to home and vice versa, lower costs (this issue is somewhat controversial), and possibly a smaller carbon footprint [9] .",
