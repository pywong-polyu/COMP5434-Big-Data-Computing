            "text": "In order to evaluate the interactions between a potential drug candidate like inhibitor N3 and the residues in substrate binding site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ), we used molecular docking and dynamics simulations. The structural features describing the degrees of folding states of M pro formed by beta-barrels and alpha-helices were analyzed by means of root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, radius of gyration, residue velocity, H-bonding, dihedral angle distributions and radial distribution function. All of the residues forming ligand binding domain (LBD) of M pro lie within the allowed region of the dihedral angle distributions as observed from the equilibrating best pose of M pro -N3 system. Sharp peaks of radial distribution function (RDF) for Hbonding atom pairs (about 2 \u00c5 radial distance apart) describe the strong interactions between inhibitor and SARS-CoV-2 M pro . During MD simulations, HSE163 has the lowest residue speed offering a sharp RDF peak whereas GLN192 has the highest residue speed resulting a flat RDF peak for the H-bonding atom pairs of M pro -N3 system. Along with negative values of coulombic and Lenard-Jones energies, MM/PBSA free energy of binding contributed by the non-covalent interactions between M pro and N3 has been obtained to be -19.45 \u00b1 3.6 kcal/mol. These physical parameters demonstrate the binding nature of an inhibitor in M pro -LBD. This study will be helpful in evaluating the drug candidates which are expected to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 structural proteins.",

The SARS-CoV-2 proteins have ligand binding domains (LBD) which are targets for the potential inhibitors [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] . The researchers are working clinically as well as computationally on the different types of potential antiviral drugs in order to search for the effective control of the ongoing pandemic. The best binding drugs like inhibitor N3 [1, 2] , -ketoamide derivative [6] , cannabisin A and darunavir [7] execute stable interactions to inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ). These types of drugs prevent the viral transcription and replication by interfering with the polypeptide transnational activities [3] . Early research focused on the study of covalent inhibitors targeting the catalytic HIS41-CYS145 dyad which may result in off-target side effects and toxicity [8] . Noncovalent inhibitors are beneficial for the easy reaction pathway of ligand binding and dissociation. Some vaccines have been brought into practice along with the clinical trials to * Corresponding authors.",

Human genetics, host immune response, age and comorbidities influence the cytokine release syndrome [9] . The coronavirus consists of a positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome with about 30 thousand nucleotides which encodes two overlapping polyproteins pp1a and pp1ab. The M pro , also known as 3CL pro , is a 33.8 kDa cysteine protease that conserves functional polypeptides released by proteolytic processing of pp1a and pp1ab [2] . The key enzyme, SARS-CoV-2 M pro plays an important role in gene transcription activity. The M pro -LBD has the catalytic HIS41-CYS145 dyad in between I and II domains comprising of residues 8-101 and 102-184, respectively, and including an anti-parallel beta-barrel [2, 4] . Flexible alpha-helices and strong beta-barrel structures forming three domains of the M pro are shown in Fig. 1 drug candidates with the LBD residues. The peptidomimetic inhibitor N3 with well designed side chains fits finely in the substrate binding pocket.

Thus prepared M pro structure was uploaded to Swiss PDB Viewer and it was optimized selecting all residues using gromos96 43B1 force field [24] . The structure of inhibitor N3 obtained from 6LU7.PDB was cross-checked with PyMOL, protonated and then uploaded to ACD/ChemSketch 12.0 for its geometrical optimization [25] . The electrically neutral N3 with 99 atoms has the mass of 682.81 amu. The ligand moiety, N3 was docked non-covalently in the co-crystallized form of its original position in 6LU7.PB with the resulting RMSD 1.66 \u00c5 as determined from the Dock-RMSD tool ( Fig. 1-b) [26] . The docking software used was AutoDock 4.2 [27] . The AutoDock Tool performs grid-based energy evaluation using Lamarckian genetic algorithm [28] . During the docking simulations, side chains and torsional bonds of N3 were rotated freely by keeping the receptor M pro system rigid. Gasteiger charges [29] were computed by adding polar hydrogens to M pro . Fifty runs of docking simulations were performed with 300 population size, 2,500,000 evaluations and 27,000 generations. To generate the docking box of actual mapping, grid point spacing of 0.375 \u00c5, coordinates of central grid points (x = -9.204 \u00c5, y = 14.323 \u00c5, z = 67.590 \u00c5) and grid (x, y, z) points of (64, 90, 70) were employed in the receptor M pro -LBD. To obtain the best docking pose of N3 in the M pro system, the process was revised five times. The best docked conformer of main protease-inhibitor (M pro -N3) was then subjected to nanoscale molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations for the purpose of evaluating the stable interactions by means of equilibration techniques.",

The missing H-atoms in protein data bank (PDB) file of M pro -N3 system were assigned automatically during the PSF generation. The parameter file contains the values of numerical constants which are used to calculate bonded and non-bonded energies of CHARMM potential function [19] . The N3 was obtained from the best pose conformer of M pro -N3 system after the molecular docking simulations. The missing hydrogen atoms were added to N3 and it was subjected to SwissParam server [33] to generate the related parameter and topology files. The related topology files were used to generate PSF of both M pro and inhibitor N3, and both structures were merged to form the full PSF and PDB files of M pro -N3 complex with the help of MergeStructs plugin-1.1 of visual molecular dynamics (VMD) [34] . This method preserves all of the original bonds and existing coordinates in both M pro and N3 molecules so that the original pose of N3 remains unchanged while liganded in the M pro -LBD. Thus prepared M pro -N3 structure assigning with all H-atoms was fully solvated in a periodic box of 41040 TIP3P-water molecules. The system was neutralized with 0.15 mol/L concentration of Na + and Cl \u2212 ions in order to provide a cellular environment.

Particle mesh Ewald (PME) was active with Ewald coefficient 0.25, grid spacing 1.0 \u00c5 and grid dimensions (72, 88, 80 \u00c5). The NAMD simulations were performed in NPT ensemble using Langevin piston temperature, pressure and damping coefficient as 300 K, 1.0 bar and 1 ps \u22121 , respectively. The MD simulations of M pro -N3 system were performed using a time step of 2 fs and constraining the H-atoms with rigid bonds. The coulombic and van der Waals interactions were evaluated using 1-4 scaling and distance related parameters: 10 \u00c5, 12 \u00c5 and 14 \u00c5 for switching, cut-off and pair-list distances, respectively. The number of steps implemented for energy minimization or geometrical optimization of M pro -N3 system were 3000 CG steps. The system was subjected to 50 ns equilibrating simulation at the constant temperature 300 K. Verlet algorithm [35] was used to calculate the atomic trajectories. With the help of NAMD-Energy Plugin-1.4, the interaction energies (electrostatic and van der Waals) were evaluated. The residue speed or displacement per frame were observed by means of VMD Timeline-2.3 [34] . The timebased changes of the physical parameters (root mean square deviation, root mean square fluctuation, residue velocity, dihedral angle distributions, radial distribution function, solvent accessible surface area and H-bonding) describe the structural properties of protein-ligand systems as studied in the previous researches [36, 37, 38, 39] . These tools were also used to evaluate the structural changes of the M pro -inhibitor system during the MD simulations.

These parameters collectively describe the conformational and binding properties of the receptor-ligand system [19] . The protein structure and stability depends on the number of H-bonding residues in the protein backbone and side chains. As a binary two dimensional matrix, Fig. 2 -a shows the contact map of H-bonding amino acid residues obtained by machine learning technique [38] after 50 ns equilibrations of SARS-CoV-2 M pro system. The contact map is invariant of rotations and translations which distinguishes nature of H-bonding interactions between main chains and/or side chains as indicated by dark, blue and red points in Fig. 2-a. Here, alpha-helices, antiparallel beta-sheet and parallel beta-sheet appear adjacent to diagonal, cross-diagonal and parallel to diagonal, respectively. In this way, root mean square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) and radius of gyration (RG) describe the conformational stability of the protein backbone forming alpha-and beta-strands and side chain residues. Their time-based changes explain the degree of folding states and compactness of the system by acting as the reaction coordinates. The average RMSD of the viral receptor M pro is 2.40 \u00b1 0.34 \u00c5 and that of the inhibitor N3 in LBD is 1.41 \u00b1 0.32 \u00c5 provided with standard deviation (SD) as the error value. The small fluctuations seen in the RMSD plots ( Fig. 2-b) are due to the minutely changing number of H-bonds among the protein residues during the equilibration run. The mean RG is 22.70 \u00b1 0.20 \u00c5 for M pro and 6.61 \u00b1 0.25 \u00c5 for N3. The RMSF of each residue has been shown in Fig. 2 -c whose value lies between 0.3 \u00c5 and 1.5 \u00c5. The RMSF of terminal residues SER1 and GLN306, and the intermediate residues TYR154 and ASP155 has larger values than the other residues of showing higher flexibility in the M pro system. Thus, the average measures of RMSD, RMSF and RG resulting in small fluctuations indicate the conformational stability of protein-drug systems during MD simulations.",

The H-bonds distribution between polar N and O atoms by the M pro -N3 interactions is 6 \u00b1 1 throughout the simulation time ( Fig. 5-b) . The number of H-bonds was estimated by assuming donor-acceptor distance 3.5 \u00c5 and cut-off angle 30 o . Even the energy due to thermal fluctuation makes the Hbonds distribution change. From in-silico docking followed by 50 ns equilibration runs of M pro -N3 best pose, we have found that the M pro -LBD residues forming stable H-bonds with N3 are PHE140, ASN142, HSE163, HSE164, GLU166 and GLN192 (Fig. 4) .

A strong H-bonding atom pair: HE2(HSE163)-O7(N3) results a sharp RDF peak in about 2.10 \u00b1 0.55 \u00c5 radial distance and a weaker pair: O(GLN192)-H2(N3) results a flat RDF in about 4.20 \u00b1 2.65 \u00c5 radial distance. Here, the strongly interacting residue GLU166 forms two stable H-bonds with the inhibitor N3 resulting the sharp RDF peaks.

Fig. 6 -a shows a plot for dihedral angle distributions which is also known as Ramachandran plot. In this plot, there are 15 amino acid residues of the M pro -LBD whose dihedral angles ( , ) distribute mainly in three quadrants. The characteristic features of the Ramachandran plot are such that the right twisted antiparallel beta-barrels lie in the first quadrant (+ , + ), right-handed alpha-helices fall in the second quadrant (-, + ) and the left-handed alpha-helices fall in the third quadrant (-, -). Because the residue GLY has no side chains, it performs no steric hindrance with the neighboring residues and offers a larger crude velocity. Due to this fact that it is allowed in the white region of the Ramachandran plot [14, 15] . The constraints imposed by backbone H-bonding induce the changes in dihedral angle distributions of alpha-helix and beta-forms. The torsion angles of M pro residues obtained after in-silico docking and 50 ns equilibrating run are plotted in Fig. 6 -b and these values for M pro -LBD residues are listed in Table 1 .

            "text": "The calculations based on MM/PBSA method of binding free energy assist to obtain the important biophysical information of drug binding mechanism in the protein-enzyme systems. The MM/PBSA free energy of M pro -N3 binding has been obtained to be -19.45 \u00b1 3.6 kcal/mol for which the MM contributions from coulombic and Lennard-Jones interactions are -47.06 \u00b1 5.01 kcal/mol and -61.16 \u00b1 3.82 kcal/mol, respectively. Here, the PB term is 95.54 \u00b1 4.77 kcal/mol as polar solvation energy and the SA term is -6.77 \u00b1 0.24 kcal/mol as nonpolar solvation energy. Due to the changing nature of dielectric constant ( ) with the protein residues, the MM/PBSA results may be more accurate for slightly higher whose default value is taken to be unity in MM electrostatic calculation [44] . Though there are some evidences of poor correlation between MM/PBSA results and experimental data for the systems like SARS-CoV-2 M pro having shallow binding cleft [45, 46] , our result is in a close agreement with the MM/PBSA free energy values for the non-covalent ligands reported by Muhtar et al. (2021) [47] . According to Gupta et al. (2020), the MM/PBSA free energy for di-hydroergotamine is -17.9 kcal/mol and that for midostaurin is -16.2 kcal/mol. Due to the higher binding affinity, these were reported as potential drug candidates in SARS-CoV-2 M pro [43] .",

The small fluctuations seen in RMSD and RG values explain the conformational stability of M pro -inhibitor system during the molecular docking and dynamics simulations. The RMSD of both receptor M pro and inhibitor N3 lies below 3 \u00c5 and the RG values are 22.70 \u00b1 0.20 \u00c5 and 6.61 \u00b1 0.25 \u00c5, respectively. The RG with small standard deviation measures the compactness of the protein-ligand system. Also, the RMSF values of M pro residues lie below 1.5 \u00c5. Residue speed or displacement/frame is the least (0.2 \u00c5/frame) for CYS160 and the greatest (2.51 \u00c5/frame) for TYR154. The sharpness of RDF curve about small radial distance of H-bonding atom pairs reflects the nature of strong interactions between inhibitor and SARS-CoV-2 M pro . A way of evaluating the binding mechanism of an inhibitor in the M pro -LBD is to study the nature of RDF curves. In the M pro -N3 binding, HSE163 has a sharp RDF for the strong H-bonding atom pairs within 2.10 \u00b1 0.55 \u00c5 radial distance, whereas GLN192 has a flat RDF for the weak H-bonding atom pairs within 4.20 \u00b1 2.65 \u00c5 radial distance. Being adapted in the M pro -LBD, N3 acquires hydrophobic interactions along with coulombic energy -49.74 \u00b1 6.21 kcal/mol and van der Waals energy -58.24 \u00b1 4.94 kcal/mol. The MM/PBSA free energy of M pro -N3 binding has been calculated to be - 19.45 \u00b1 3.6 kcal/mol as the contribution of non-covalent interactions.",
