Chan and Zary [4] have carried out an integrative review of the peerreviewed literature and have included and synthesized 37 articles, finding that Artificial Intelligence has been utilized for three major purposes in the field of medical education: namely, (I) supporting and enhancing students' learning experience; (II) assessing and monitoring educational/learning outcomes; and (III) reviewing and improving the medical school curriculum (especially the undergraduate one). Artificial intelligence can enable direct and personalized/individualized interactions between the instructor and the students, facilitating exchanges and feedback, better guiding, informing, and customizing the learning pathway. Not only can the educational transactions happen in real-time, but they are also cost-effective, given the decreased costs generated by the use of Artificial Intelligence [5] .",

Courses can be indeed conducted by means of classical face-to-face lectures in the classroom or utilizing a hybrid/blended approach, exploiting the new information and communication technologies and immersive environments (known also as virtual realities or virtual worlds). Computer-enhanced lessons, such as massive open online courses (known as MOOCs), differ from traditional residential courses, in that they are offered to larger-scale communities of students and usually require/enable a much more interactive participation. According to Schneider and Germann (1999) [8] , distance learning has evolved during the decades, passing from mail correspondence and print materials (the so-called phase of 'correspondence study', or the first generation of distance learning) to voice, mail, fax, radio, television, video, and audio recordings with interactive instructions (the phase of 'multimedia distance teaching' or 'broadcast/teleconferencing', or the second generation of distance learning). Further evolutions include emails, digital 'serious games', webinars, webcasts/podcasts (the phase of 'interactive, web-based instruction', or the third generation of distance learning) [9] .",

While these are well-studied in fields such as medical research and methodology, translational medicine, and clinical practice, they remain overlooked and understudied in the field of medical education [14, 15] . Therefore, in the present paper, we will review the current and potential future applications of big data with a special focus on the field of medical education and the still ongoing \"Coronavirus Disease 2019\" (COVID-19) outbreak [16] . Besides straining healthcare facilities worldwide, this pandemic is posing challenging safety issues, both for instructors and professors and students who should be able to safely deliver and receive lectures, respectively, while, at the same time, integrity and continuity of the medical education process should be guaranteed. Access to education is, indeed, a fundamental right, which has been seriously threatened and limited/restricted during the pandemic: biomedical education is of crucial importance to train and form future specialists.",

For the purpose, authors assessed the following areas/topics: computational big data (predictive and nowcasting/forecasting models), digital big data (including Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things (IoT), Internet of Medical Things (IoMT), social media and social networks, blockchain, clinical data storing and processing systems, and tele-medicine), molecular big data (OMICS approaches and high-throughput technologies, such as next-generation sequencing and micro-arrays). Authors were able to sample 362 subjects, only 6-22% of which reporting experience with at least one type of big data during their clinical or study/research activities.

Students should be provided with courses focusing more on quantitative skills, incorporating machine learning and artificial intelligence, mathematical modeling, computation and simulation, and big data [25] . This is true both at the undergraduate and postgraduate level, with several medical specializations (like radiology, oncology, physical medicine, rehabilitation, rheumatology, cardiology, or urology, among others) expanding current knowledge levels, skills, and competencies [26, 27] . Attempts to redesign specialist syllabus are very recent, but it can be anticipated that they will have a great impact on future medical practice.

Four, different clusters of medical students could be identified: the \"risers\", the \"improvers\", the \"solids\", and the \"statics\", based on the combination of admission and subsequent scores. More specifically, the \"risers\" and the \"statics\" reported the highest and lowest chances of academic success. Authors concluded that the medical student population is not homogenous, but inherently heterogeneous and that a big data-based approach can effectively identify the determinants of academic performance related outcomes and potentially counteract/prevent drop-out, which imposes a significant societal and economic-financial burden. Similar findings were replicated by Bientzle et al. [36] . Utilizing big data generated by 23,633 users using Amboss, an online website-based platform, in the period April 2014-April 2017, authors assessed if particular formats of learning activities and materials (multiple choice questions versus learning cards or individual notes) were related to learning outcomes.

More specifically, medicine/medical learning represents a complex 'learning health system', in which the medical student/resident/ doctor continuously learns from interacting with the instructor/patient, respectively. Big data can facilitate and assist these processes, guiding and informing them. However, despite the enormous production of big data in biomedicine, medical education remains centered on information acquisition and application processes [57] . A transition towards \"knowledge discovery\", \"knowledge management\", and \"knowledge application\", in such a way that big data become actionable and operational data, is absolutely necessary, even if it is highly challenging [57] . A shift towards a \"competency-based medical educational system\" is also of paramount importance [58, 59] .",
