ET-1 plasma levels were measured in a cohort of 194 Covid-19 patients stratified according to the clinical severity of their illness. Hospitalised patients, including those who died and those developing acute myocardial or kidney injury, had significantly elevated ET-1 plasma levels during the acute phase of infection.",

In the present study, we tested the hypothesis that elevated levels of plasma ET-1 in the acute phase of Covid-19 infection would be associated with more severe disease. levels between patient categories A-C and controls, between different time-points for categories A-C, and between subgroups defined by clinical endpoints was undertaken using the Independent Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test. To assess for potential confounding effects when comparing ET-1 levels between patient categories A-C and controls as well as between all Covid-19 infected patients with controls, univariate analysis of co-variance was performed for each of: age, gender, ethnicity, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, congestive cardiac failure and chronic kidney disease. To assess the association of baseline ET-1 with hospitalisation amongst infected patients, a binary logistic regression model was calculated adjusted for recognised confounders of baseline ET-1: hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, congestive cardiac failure and chronic kidney disease. in Group B and 32.1% in Group C. The frequency of underlying comorbidities was higher in Groups B and C compared with Group A and controls ( Table 1) . Despite heterogeneity in clinical and demographic characteristics, differences in baseline ET-1 between infected versus non-infected patients and all patient categories remained significant (p<0.05) in corrected models for age, gender, ethnicity, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, congestive cardiac failure and chronic kidney disease using between-subjects effect analysis of co-variance ( J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the lack of prognostic utility of C-terminal proendothelin-1 (proET-1) to predict mortality in Covid-19 [14] .

The magnitude of the ET-1 elevation we have observed in hospitalised Covid-19 patients was similar to that reported in the early studies comparing ET-1 levels in PAH patients with normal subjects [15] [16] . Multiple large clinical trials have now established the prognostic benefit of ET receptor antagonists in idiopathic and connective tissue disease associated PAH [11] . Outside of PAH, increased plasma levels of ET-1 are also associated with increased coronary [17] and systemic vasoconstriction [18] in coronary microvascular dysfunction, and endothelial dysfunction in vasospastic angina [19] ). Due to the skewed distribution of ET-1, no potential or extreme outliers have been excluded from analysis. Outliers were noted to mostly occur in patient category C (hospitalised and requiring supplemental oxygen/assisted ventilation) or amongst subgroups with clinical complications of Covid-19 infection therefore we have assumed these values reflect true biological variability in the study population. Comparison of ET-1 between patient categories was performed using the Independent Samples Kruskal-Wallis Test and also between time-points for each patient category. In the latter case, an independent samples non-parametric test was chosen to increase power given the low number of paired corresponding samples available due to patient drop-out at 28 and 90 days.",

Covid-19 infection may up-regulate circulating cytokines to stimulate the regulated ET-1 secretory pathway. Additionally, viral entry into endothelial cells induces cell damage and release of stored ET-demonstrate a dynamic virus induced increase in the level of the endothelial peptide, ET-1 during the acute phase of Covid-19 infection, which is associated with the clinical severity of disease. We hypothesise that elevation of ET-1 plasma levels could result from inflammatory cytokine mediated up-regulation of the stimulated Weibel-Palade body ET-1 secretory pathway. Von-Willebrand Factor is the principal stored component of Weibel-Palade bodies [13] and has been shown to be similarly up-regulated in the acute phase of Covid-19 infection [8]. Alternatively or additionally, viral induced cell death may result in the release of stored ET-1 into the circulation (figure 2).Accumulating evidence suggests endothelial dysregulation is a key mechanism for disease progression following Covid-19 infection. Post-mortem histology from Covid-19 patients with multi-organ failure has identified pathological endotheliitis in multiple vascular beds[4,5,6] while elevation of various biomarkers of endothelial damage in patients with severe Covid-19 infection has also been demonstrated[7,8].Our results are replicated by Willems et al. who reported an elevation in ET-1 levels for a subset of 36 Covid-19 infected patients during the acute illness compared with a historic non-infected control group [12].
