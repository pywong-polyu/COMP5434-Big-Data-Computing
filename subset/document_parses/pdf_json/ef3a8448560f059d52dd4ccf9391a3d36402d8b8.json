Moreover, the delay continued in the post-epidemic period. Notably, the total time delay mainly occurred in the prehospital period. Three reasons could explain the delay. First, the reduction in person-to-person contacts as a result of the promulgation of the anti-epidemic measures, which may lead to a delayed stroke recognition [14, 15] . Another reason is the overload of Emergency Medical Dispatch (EMS) calls had led the saturation of ambulances, patients' family members were required to drive through the temperature measurement centre at free-way exit and entrance to the hospital by themselves, it may increase pre-hospital transfer time [6, 9, 16] . Finally, the reason might be that some patients arrive at the hospital delayed due to excessive worry about being infected by the new coronavirus [17] . Therefore, we suggest that local policymakers should widely disseminate knowledge of COVID-19 and set up special emergency routes at free-way exit and entrance to reduce prehospital time by removing patients' fear of COVID-19 and reducing the waiting time on highway stations.",

It was associated not only with prolonged prehospital time (OTD), but also with the time delays from door to imaging (DTI). All newly admitted patients had to accept strict COVID-19 screening in the pandemic period and post-epidemic period, including answering questions about their travel history, potential contact with a confirmed case, respiratory symptoms and chest CT [9] . There was no doubt that increased procedures will lead to time delays. Therefore, DTI time was delayed in the pandemic group compared with the pre-pandemic group, regardless of PSCs and CSC. Another thing worth noting is that DTI time was corrected in CSC but was still maintained in PSCs during the post-epidemic period. This may reflect the validity of the change in the screening mode in our stroke centre, in which patients were transferred to the imaging centre simultaneously to undergoing COVID-19 screening during the post-epidemic period. Therefore, stroke centres should establish a similar process for stroke patients, in which the patient is taken directly to the imaging centre if the likelihood of AIS-LVO is high, with COVID-19 screening and preliminary physician-patient communication carried out simultaneously. In addition, PSC's COVID-19 screening results were valid in CSC, which meant that the change in screening mode can be widely promoted.",

In CSC, referral patients' DTP and directly admitted patients' imaging to puncture time (ITP) decreased significantly in the pandemic period compared with the pre-pandemic period. Perhaps the primary reason is that, in CSC, the number of stroke patients decreased during the pandemic period, stroke teams had more sufficient preparation to deal with AIS-LVO patients who underwent EVT, and the catheter room was relatively idle. However, due to the number of EVT patients increased, the decreasing trend of DTP did not continue in postepidemic period. In addition, the time from imaging to departure, departure to CSC and DIDO did not significantly change in PSC. It is worth noting that due to the relatively inconvenient transportation during the pandemic period, most patients chose to visit PSC, rather than be directly admitted to CSC. Therefore, under the background of the normalization of epidemic prevention, PSC quickly identified and transferred AIS-LVO patients, and it might be more effective to improve the process of AIS-LVO patients.",
