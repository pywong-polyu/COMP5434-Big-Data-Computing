The effectiveness of this contact tracing strategy to mitigate transmission is sensitive to the adherence to quarantines, which may be lower for longer quarantine periods or in vaccinated populations (where perceptions of risk are reduced). This study develops a simulation model to evaluate contact tracing strategies based on the sequential testing of identified contacts after exposure as an alternative to quarantines, in which contacts are isolated only after confirmation by a positive test. The analysis considers different number and types of tests (PCR and lateral flow antigen tests (LFA)) to identify the cost-effective testing policies that minimize the expected infecting days post-exposure considering different levels of testing capacity. This analysis suggests that even a limited number of tests can be effective at reducing secondary infection risk: two LFA tests (with optimal timing) avert infectiousness at a level that is comparable to 14-day quarantine with 80-90% adherence, or equivalently, 7-9 day quarantine with full adherence (depending on the sensitivity of the LFA test). Adding a third test (PCR or LFA) reaches the efficiency of a 14-day quarantine with 90-100% adherence. These results are robust to the exposure dates of the contact, test sensitivity of LFA and alternative models of viral load evolution, which suggests that simple testing rules can be effective for improving contact tracing in settings where strict quarantine adherence is difficult to implement.",

A significant challenge in containing transmission is to halt infections generated before symptom onset and by asymptomatic cases, thus making symptom monitoring insufficient to contain the spread of the virus 8, 9 , even with close monitoring of close contacts 10 . Therefore, preventive quarantines of potentially exposed individuals have been a fundamental mitigation measure to reduce transmission in the community. These quarantine policies vary across countries, both in terms of the target population and the quarantine protocol. Most countries require preventive quarantine of traced contact between 10 and 14 days 11, 12 . Restrictions to incoming international travelers also vary across countries, ranging from no quarantine when a recent negative test result is provided to others requiring strict quarantines ranging from 10 to 14 days. Some countries even use dedicated facilities to quarantine incoming travelers. These traveling restrictions have led many traveling website hubs to provide detailed information on quarantine and testing protocols by country, (Wego: https:// blog. wego. com/ covid 19-travel-restr ictio ns-by-desti nation-count ry/; Kayak: https:// www. kayak. com/ travel-restr ictio ns).",

Quarantines have been associated with economic cost and adverse mental health effects, both when targeted to specific individuals (e.g. travellers and close contacts) 13 , and massive lockdowns and mobility restrictions 14 . These studies report negative consequences of quarantines such as post-traumatic stress symptoms, confusion, and anger, which are worsened by longer quarantine duration, infection fears, frustration, boredom, inadequate information, and financial loss among others. Quarantine measures that are too strict may reduce compliance and the incentives to report close contacts, thereby reducing the effectiveness of contact tracing strategies 15 . Approximately 75% of U.S. subjects who were surveyed indicated that they would adhere with quarantine for 14 days when mandated by a health official; however, compliance can be as low as 60% in specific demographic groups 16 . Of those who declare their lack of willingness to comply, 44% indicate that they do not think that quarantining is necessary. Improvements in testing technologies have helped to shorten quarantine periods while maintaining a low risk of secondary infections by exposed contacts 17 . For example, the WHO quarantine recommendations for contacts of individuals with a confirmed or probable case of COVID-19 have been made more flexible and evolved from 14 days from their last exposure 18 to more discretionary measures, such as advising local public health authorities to account for local conditions and needs to determine the length of quarantine. These options include stopping quarantine for contacts that have not presented symptoms after day 10 or after day 7 with a negative diagnostic specimen test 12, 19 .",

Thus, we analyze the optimal timing of different types of tests to reduce the risk of exposure of active (not quarantined) unconfirmed contacts to susceptible individuals, thereby helping to reduce both infection risk and the costs of quarantine through a cost-efficient use of testing resources. This finding is particularly important for minimizing disruptions in essential activities, such as highly specialized workers, teachers, students and healthcare workers, where quarantines may require major re-organization of the operations.

Several modeling studies suggest that quarantine periods can be shortened to 7 days with a negative PCR test at the end of this period because it has a residual risk equivalent to a quarantine period of 14 days with no testing 22, 23 . The recent modeling study by 24 also suggests that daily LFA testing of traced contacts over 5 days without quarantine if all tests are negative can actually reduce the risk of secondary infections relative to a mitigation strategy of 14 quarantine days with moderate levels of adherence.

            "text": "This study was motivated through the design of testing and quarantine policies for schools in Chile, where in-person teaching has been prohibited during most of the pandemic. In planning a safe return to in-person schooling, Chilean health authorities have developed protocols on how to handle confirmed cases and require quarantines of the complete classroom of an infected student with flexibility on the quarantine strategies for teachers, who received priority in the immunization campaign and whose quarantine may induce severe disruptions in the school operation. An alternative to quarantine is to allow teachers to continue face-to-face teaching but closely monitor them through an optimal design of PCR and LFA tests to reduce the risk of secondary infections. A similar strategy can be used to ease the quarantine requirements of the classroom of infected students, where the risk of transmission has been shown to be relatively low for younger students 25 along with the adoption of masks and other mitigation measures 26, 27 . This test-to-stay approach has been implemented in the US and UK, reporting significant increase in in-person teaching 28-31 . Our modeling approach is similar to that of 4,23 and used simulation methods to generate scenarios of viral loads of infected contacts that may or may not present symptoms. These simulated viral load paths relate the infectiousness of the contact with test sensitivity during post-exposure time, enabling us to model the reduction of secondary infections under alternative sequential testing schemes. Our modeling analysis confirms the findings of 4 that despite the lower sensitivity of LFA tests relative to PCR, they are more efficient in averting infections when PCR tests take more than one day to confirm the results. We also corroborate the result of 23 that daily LFA testing during 5 days postexposure, with isolation required after a positive test result, essentially averts all the risk of secondary infections and is equivalent to a 14-day quarantine policy for high adherence scenarios. We show that these results are robust to the days of exposure of the traced contact with the index case, test sensitivity scenarios and to alternative models of viral load evolution. When testing resources are scarce, our modeling analysis suggests that using three LFA tests with an appropriate timing during the postexposure period can also achieve a very low risk of secondary infections, which is superior to that of a 14-day quarantine policy with 90% adherence. Our analysis shows that the timing of these sequential tests is important because suboptimal testing schedules may substantially increase the risk of secondary infections.",

            "text": "Another important difference of our work compared to that of 4,23 is that we analyze settings with uncertainty on the exact day of exposure of the contact ( 22 follows a similar approach to model exposure uncertainty of incoming travelers based on the incidence of country of origin). This difference is important for studying settings www.nature.com/scientificreports/ with structured contact networks that meet recurrently, such as workplaces, schools, healthcare facilities and households. We show that modeling this uncertainty is relevant for the design of an optimal testing schedule and should also account for different types of index cases: we cover scenarios where the index case is identified at symptom onset or by surveillance testing, among others. Our modeling analysis suggests that an optimal design of testing strategies of traced contacts after exposure can be effective for gradually easing quarantine requirements for essential activities where the costs of quarantines are high or have low adherence rates. Nevertheless, the implications of the proposed quarantine/testing strategies need to be evaluated with caution because they might impact the behavior of confirmed cases and their contacts in multiple dimensions. On the positive side, easing quarantine requirements may lead to higher adherence of these policies by the traced contacts and a higher proportion of contacts reported by an index case. On the negative side, relaxing quarantine policies may reduce the adoption of other mitigation measures in the community and work environments (such as the use of personal protective equipment and physical distancing). Further research is needed to empirically evaluate the overall impact of the proposed contact monitoring schemes on community transmission.",

Individuals become infectious when their viral load exceeds 10 6 cp/ml 4, 32 . Each viral load path is simulated using five control points generated as random variables: (1) the day of infection; (2) the time (since the infection date) at which the minimum level of detection (LOD) with PCR test is reached; (3) the peak level of viral load and the time it is reached; (4) the time of symptom onset for symptomatic cases; and (5) the time at which the infectious period ends. This simulation procedure is illustrated in Fig. 1 , where Figure 1 . Description of the simulation of viral load paths. The horizontal axis represents a timeline, with t = 0 representing the date of detection of the index case and its contact. Each gray line indicates one simulated viral load path of the infected contact, which is generated randomly using 5 control points shown with squares for 2 independent paths (with light and dark colors). Control 1 is the day of infection, which in the example includes days-1 and -2 for each respective path. Control point 2 is the day on which a viral load is detectable by PCR. Control 3 is generated only for symptomatic cases and corresponds to the day of symptom onset (represented with a dark circle). Control 4 is the peak viral load and the day it is attained. Control 5 is the day at which the infectious period ends and indicates the slope of the viral load decline. Red dots indicate the infectious days on each viral path; individuals self-isolate the day after presenting symptoms; therefore infecting days postsymptoms are averted. The top part of the figure shows the probability that the infected contact is contagious on that day (excluding days where infection is averted). Expected infecting days, which are conditional on the contact being infected, are equal to the sum of these probabilities. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the horizontal axis is a timeline, with t = 0 representing the time at which the index case is confirmed and the individual is identified as contact. Exposure dates of the contact occur during or before the confirmation date ( t \u2264 0 ). Further details on the simulation, including the probability distributions used to simulate the control points, are described in the Appendix B. The red points in Fig. 1 show the days on each path in which the individual was infectious, i.e., when the viral load exceeds the level of infectiousness ( 10 6 cp/ml). Symptomatic cases are assumed to self-isolate after symptom onset, whereas asymptomatic cases are not isolated and therefore continue to infect throughout the infectious period. Conditional on being infected at exposure, the probability that the individual is infecting others on a given day is the fraction of sample paths that are above the infectiousness threshold on that day. The expected number of infecting days is the sum of these probabilities across all days after the first exposure date. An example of these calculations is provided in Fig. 1 for the illustrative sample paths that were simulated. In the actual simulation, we consider 200,000 sample paths for each exposure date. The probability distribution of the exposure data is described next.",

Table 1 describes the sensitivity of the different tests considered in our analysis. Sensitivity of PCR is set to 100% above a viral load of 10 334 . For LFA, we considered different scenarios which account for reported differences among manufacturers and the type of sample swab used. 32 compare more than 100 LFA tests, reporting test sensitivity relative to PCR for different cycle threshold values. We converted cycle thresholds to viral load assuming an equivalence of Ct values of 35 and 25 to viral loads of 10 3 and 10 6 , interpolating for intermediate values assuming that a Ct increase of one corresponds to a factor of two in the viral load concentration. We used the top decile of the reported tests to define the LFA High scenario. Note that the sample swabs in that study where collected by professional health care personnel, which can be higher compared to self-collected samples (i.e. home testing). Studies by [35] [36] [37] comparing self-collected versus professional-collected swabs show differences in test sensitivity in the order of 5-15%. Hence, we considered an intermediate sensitivity parameter reducing the high performance LFA test by 10%, generating the LFA Med scenario shown in Table 1 . The LFA Med-Low scenario was constructed using the bottom decile of the tests studied in 32 , using professionalcollected swabs; the LFA Low reduces that sensitivity by 10% to account for a self-collected swab. This range of sensitivity considered for LFA tests is consistent with the values reported in recent studies 38, 39 . PCR tests are reported with a 1 day delay, while LFA tests provide immediate results with no delay in all the scenarios. Figure 3 shows the infectiousness profile and test sensitivity during post-exposure date ( t = 0 ) based on the simulated viral load paths of our model. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The false negative rate (FNR) of a test is defined as the probability of obtaining a negative test result on an infected subject. In our simulation, the FNR of PCR tests can be calculated as the fraction of sample paths with viral load below the LOD of the test ( 10 3 cp/ml). The top panel of Fig. 4 illustrates an example of a test schedule with one PCR test implemented 1 day after the index case detection ( t = 1 ). The contact is isolated when the test gives a positive results with 1 day of delay, and the infecting days for these cases correspond to the purple dots shown in the figure. Note that these detected case do infect during the day the PCR test was taken due to the 1 day delay in reporting. Negative results filter out all the sample paths with viral loads above LOD = 10 3 on day t = 1 : all of these paths are discarded when test results are reported; therefore, an infected individual could evolve on only one of the remaining paths with viral loads below the LOD on the test date.

The horizontal blue line shows the lowest expected number of infecting days of the traced contact if he/she is immediately quarantined upon confirmation of the index case (with 100% adherence), and it is equal to 0.26 expected infecting days, which represents a lower bound on the performance of all possible testing policies.

For each pair (#PCR, #LFA), we identified the optimal policy by selecting the testing schedule that minimizes the expected infecting days; we found that the optimal testing schedule was similar across all the parameter values of infectivity ( \u03b2 ) that were used to simulate the exposure time distribution, with some exceptions. An example where the optimal policy changes with \u03b2 is when a single test is available: the simulations using a higher infectivity parameter suggest that earlier testing is more efficient to avert risk, because it is more likely that the contact was exposed earlier (see Fig. 2 ). When the optimal testing schedule changes depending on the infectivity parameter, we also identify the policy that minimizes the worst-case scenario (i.e. highest expected infecting days) across all values of \u03b2 , hereon referred to as the robust testing policy.",

The optimal schedule of the two LFA tests is on days 1 and 3, thus leading to 0.99 expected infection days. However, changing to a testing schedule on days 1 and 2 deteriorates the performance to 1.49 expected infecting days, a 50% increase on the risk relative to the optimal strategy. Similarly, when using 2 LFAs and 1 PCR, the optimal schedule on days 1 and 2 for the LFA and day 3 for the PCR leads to an average of 0.63 infection days compared to 1.37 days when using a schedule of LFAs in days 1 and 2 and PCR at day 1 (a 117% increase in the risk of secondary infection). The top panel of Fig. 5 shows significant dispersion on the performance across testing strategies using the same number of tests, suggesting that optimizing the dates of the tests matters. Figure 6 shows the results for the scenario when the contact was exposed to an index case detected by a LFA test. In this scenario, the index case has no symptoms at the moment of detection and hence could be presymptomatic or asymptomatic, which in turn affects the possible dates of exposure. Specifically, since we model an environment where contacts are recurrent, the range of possible dates of infection is longer when the index case is asymptomatic (see Fig. 2 ). This longer time period of exposure increases the likelihood that the contact is already infectious at the time the index case is detected. Consequently, the lower bound represented by the blue horizontal line, which was attained with immediate quarantine of the traced contact at t = 1 and 100% adherence, leads to an expected infecting days of 0.78, which is significantly higher than the 0.26 bound attained when the index case is detected at symptom onset, see Fig. 5 . The upper bound, illustrated by the red line, is the expected infecting days without quarantine or testing, with isolation only at symptom onset.

The main difference is that the lower bound attained with immediate quarantine with 100% adherence reaches 0.28, which represents a 64% reduction relative to the bound attained when the index case is detected with a random LFA test.

Overall, the results suggest that sequential testing with LFA tests is a cost effective alternative to quarantines to mitigate infection risk of traced contacts, when considering tests of moderate sensitivity levels (90% for viral loads above 10 6 (cp/ml) and 75% for loads between 10 4.5 and 10 6 (cp/ml)). However, there is mixed evidence of the sensitivity of LFA in practice and it is of interest to analyze how this test sensitivity may impact the effectiveness of the sequential testing strategy relative to quarantines of close contacts. Figure 7 shows the robust testing schedules generated based on the simulations with the LFA Med-Low test sensitivity scenario (see Table 1 ). As expected, there is an increase in the expected infecting days for the testing schemes using LFA tests alone; this drop is more pronounced when using one or two LFA tests, and is negligible when using three or more tests. This suggests that using sequential testing may compensate the lower sensitivity www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Figure 6 . Evaluation of testing policies for a traced contact exposed to an index case detected by random LFA test. In the upper and middle panels, the horizontal axis contains the number of PCR and LFA tests. Blue, green, purple, and red horizontal lines correspond to the average infecting days when traced contact is quarantined for 14 days with adherence of 100%, 90%, 80%, and 0%, respectively. In the upper panel, each dot displays the performance of a testing schedule and infectivity parameter, and the lower and upper limits of boxes are the 25% and 75% quartiles. For the robust testing policies, the middle panel displays the average expected infecting days (small squares), the range of the expected infecting days across all parameters (gray rectangles) and the 10% and 90% percentiles. The lowest panel shows the schedule of the robust testing policy for each group of tests. Our analysis has focused in comparing risk-reduction strategies of sequential testing with no quarantine relative to a 14-day quarantine with different levels of adherence. As an alternative, in what follows, we compare the performance of this sequential testing strategy with quarantines of different time extensions. The top panel of Fig. 8 shows the expected infection days of using strict quarantines (with 100% adherence and no testing) of different time length, between 1 and 12 days, starting at the time of detection of the index case. Expected infecting days is calculated taking an average across all the values of the infectivity parameter \u03b2 used in the simulations, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and these calculations are presented separately for the different alternatives of index case detection. Quarantines of three or fewer days lead to more than 5 infection days on average, which can be significantly reduced by increasing the length of the quarantine, down to one or lower infection days for quarantines of more than 10 days. Note that the expected infecting days do not reach zero as we increase the length of the quarantine because the infection days of the contact prior to index case detection are unavoidable.",

Nevertheless, short quarantines of 7 or fewer days-a policy that has been used by many countries to quarantine incoming travelers (e.g. Thailand, Italy, and Austria as for Dec 21st 2021, https:// www. kayak. com/ travel-restr ictio ns)-could be replaced by 2 sequential LFA tests without increasing infection risk (the optimal schedule of these tests varies depending on the test sensitivity). In summary, these results reinforce the conclusion that sequential testing of close contacts can be an effective alternative to quarantines, even when using low sensitivity tests, if the timing of these tests is set appropriately.",

Blank entries indicate that the corresponding quarantine time extension cannot be replaced with 5 or fewer tests. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ \u2022 The performance of sequential testing relative to strict quarantines of traced contacts is similar to what we obtained in our main results. Based on the simulations with the LFA Med test sensitivity scenario, we find that two tests with no quarantines is equivalent to a 14 day quarantine with 80-90% adherence. The performance with 3 and 4 tests is equivalent to 90-100% adherence. The performance with 5 tests is close to 100% adherence of the 14-day strict quarantine. \u2022 With the lower sensitivity scenario LFA Med-Low, the results based on the viral load trajectories of 42 have small drop in performance, similar to what we obtained in our main results. \u2022 The performance for the cases where the index is detected at symptom onset are similar to those obtained when the detection is with a random LFA test, a pattern that is also consistent with our main results. \u2022 The optimal schedules obtained with the 42 viral loads are similar to those reported in our main results. In 42 , some of the tests are scheduled one day later, because the viral load trajectories in this model tend to decline more slowly, leading to a more extended infectious period and thereby a higher residual risk (see Figure  D .31).",

For example, in the case of an index case detected at symptom onset, conducting LFA tests of high quality but with a self-collected sample on the first and third days after contact is determined is more effective at averting secondary risk infections relative to a 14-day quarantine with 80% adherence (assuming 100% compliance in the isolation of the contact when confirmed by a positive test). In the scenarios with lower LFA test sensitivity, combining one LFA test and one PCR test achieves a similar performance compared to a 14-day quarantine with 80-90% adherence.

First, we assume that confirmed cases fully adhere to strict isolation, which is plausible to implement in environments with stricter control, such as workplaces, healthcare facilities and schools, or where isolation in dedicated facilities is feasible. However, strict isolation may be difficult to implement in other environments, such as households or for social contact networks. Second, our analysis is based on simulated viral load trajectories that have been calibrated in previous work 4, 42 . However, recent work by 43, 47 suggests that the viral load of new variants (such as Delta) may exhibit differences from those reported for the original strains during the initial waves of the COVID-19 pandemic. Interestingly, our results suggest www.nature.com/scientificreports/ that the effectiveness of sequential testing is similar for alternative models of viral load trajectories, some of which included variants of concern. Nevertheless, our results must be interpreted with caution and may require further analysis in the future with alternative models of viral load evolution. Third, testing strategies may lead to changes in the behavior of the traced contacts on their adoption of complementary prevention measures, such as masking and personal hygiene, which are relevant when the individual is actively in contact with the susceptible population. Our analysis is focused on improving contact tracing for essential workers, such as medical staff, teachers, and specialized workers, among others, where quarantines might heavily disturb the normal functioning of crucial activities. We implemented some of the insights obtained from the modeling analysis in two schools in Chile, with the objective of maximizing in-person teaching during 2021. In Chile, health authorities mandate that upon a confirmed case of a student in the school, the whole class where the student attended two days prior to case confirmation or symptom onset should be quarantined for 14 days. The mandate leaves to the discretion of school management how to handle the teachers that followed the mandatory hygiene measures during teaching hours in the class (wearing mask, open windows and hand washing). A 14-day quarantine of the teacher-a practice that was implemented by many schools in Chile-would generate disruptions in in-person teaching for other classes at the school. Instead, these two pilot schools opted to maintain in-person teaching for the exposed teachers that were vaccinated, but conducting three LFA tests during the 5 days following the index case detection. These tests would complement the regular weekly surveillance testing that was implemented at the schools. Between March 3rd and December 7th of 2021, 69 students were confirmed with a positive PCR tests, leading to 181 teachers who where suspect contacts and, therefore, followed the sequential LFA testing strategy (all of them were vaccinated). All of the 543 LFA tests gave negative results; 65 of the teachers also had a negative PCR test. Overall, this resulted in 1810 in-person teaching days that would have otherwise been lost under the strategy of strict quarantine of the teachers.",
