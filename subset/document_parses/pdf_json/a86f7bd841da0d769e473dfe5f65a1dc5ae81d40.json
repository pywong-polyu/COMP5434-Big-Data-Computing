The latter approach has recently been taken in Italy and Finland, where the availability of electronic gambling machines (EGMs) has been reduced. Availability reductions, in addition to mandatory identification and limiting product characteristics, are a key policy measure to limit exposure and consumption in gambling [4] . Pricing and taxation (widely used in tobacco and alcohol control, cf. [4, 5] ) are less relevant, because particularly EGM and casino gambling have quite low price elasticities of demand [6] .",

The replacement of traditional slot machines with electronic terminals that provide a variety of games is also likely to increase EGM harms [11, 12] . In addition to structural characteristics, situational characteristics, including the availability of EGMs, have been linked to increased consumption and harms. High visibility of EGMs in non-casino environments may further increase their harm potential. A systematic review [9] found that a high availability of EGMs is connected to increased volumes of gambling and increased problem gambling. In Australia, the number of EGM venues in a geographical area has also been connected to personal insolvency cases [13] .",

After discussions at the Permanent Conference on the Relationships between Central Government and the Regions, an agreement was reached in September 2017 to halve the number of gambling venues (from 98,600 to 48,000) and the number of EGMs by 35% (from 400,000 to 265,000) by the end of 2019. However, some pre-existing regional laws are more restrictive [25] .",

Recent studies conducted on the impacts of COVID-19 on gambling support this observation. The precautions taken to limit the spread of the coronavirus have included EGM shutdowns in many jurisdictions, including Finland and Italy. These shutdowns have lessened the burden of harms caused by EGM gambling, including reduced total consumption and reduced gambling harms [17, 18, 29, 30] . Also, reductions in land-based gambling consumption have not translated into increases in online gambling in many jurisdictions [15, 30, 31] .",

This claim was followed by a rebuttal by two journalists, arguing that this misalignment enabled the industry to pull over 40,000 old EGMs out of the warehouse, increasing the number of EGMs by 10.6% in 4 months. According to the article, this was another example of corruption in gambling policies.

The president of the national association of municipalities thought it was 'a good compromise' (CS 05.05.2017a). However, in a more critical commentary by a journalist, the agreement is deemed 'unpresentable' and unsatisfactory, as the suggested regulation was less strict than the local regulations already in place. The article also points out that 'anti-gambling movements' were not satisfied with the agreement. Again, this unsatisfactory result was attributed to industry lobbying.

In the last openly critical item of the analysed period (CS 15.11.2017), a journalist noted that no government, either right or left, or even the media was willing to give up gambling proceeds. This may be part of the reason Corriere della Sera did not discuss EGMs further in 2018-2019. Another reason might be the policy decision regarding the extent of national-level reductions, although this is less likely given the important space given to the issue before. Only one press item was retrieved per year during 2018-2019 and neither focused directly on EGMs.",

One of the legal justifications for the Finnish gambling monopoly is to prevent and reduce gambling-related harm (Law 2112.2016/1286, section one). However, the aggressive advertising campaigns of the monopoly holder and the placement of Following from this discussion, Veikkaus announced in September 2019 that it would reduce the number of EGMs during 2020 along with other changes to improve its approach to 'responsible gambling' (HS 5.9.2019 KSML 5.9.2019). In October, Veikkaus specified that it would remove 3500 EGMs during 2020 and up to 8000 machines in total (IS 31.10.2019; KSML, 31.10.2019). The reductions would be conducted mainly by removing some of the machines from locations with a high number of EGMs (YLE 3.12.2019). The suggestion by Veikkaus was much inferior to the initial suggestions. Furthermore, and in contrast to the Italian case, the reductions did not target the number of resale points. This was probably due to the opposition of resellers. One representative of resellers stated that 'we now have five machines. You take away the two that make the least profit and replace them with one that makes more. The impacts will be minor' (IS, 24.2.2020) . Some criticism of the limited extent of the proposed reductions emerged from researchers (KSML, 31.10.2019), but reporting on this was limited. The suggestion of the monopoly holder appeared to be accepted in the media without further need for public discussion.",

Overall, the number of AWPs had decreased by 35% and the number of venues had decreased by 31%, as planned. However, reductions targeting AWPs also translated into a 7% increase in the numbers of VLTs (a structurally more addictive type of EGM confined to gambling arcades). This shift suggests that while the overall numbers of EGMs declined in Italy, some machines were substituted with more addictive modern multigame terminals. Figure 3 shows the impacts of the AWP reductions on total GGR in 2016-2019 as well as the shares of the industry and state revenue as reported in the ADM yearly reports. The figure shows the main outcomes. First, the GGR, or total consumption, of AWPs decreased in the period 2016-2019 by 13%. The GGR of VLTs increased in the same period by 2%. Overall, the total consumption of EGM gambling therefore declined by only 6%, and not proportionately to the reduction of 35% in machine numbers. A possible explanation for this is that the AWPs targeted for removal were already not profitable and the highest producing machines were left in the market. Furthermore, a substitution effect from AWPs to newer VLTs has compensated some of the loss of GGR, although not fully. Substitution between gambling products is rarely complete. New gambling products substitute some consumption of existing ones, but also increase total market (see also [38] ).",

            "text": "EGMs increased critical public discussion during 2018 and 2019 (IL 14.8.2019). In March 2019 (MTV3 20.3.2019), a citizen initiative was launched by experts by experience of gambling harms with the aim to remove EGMs from public spaces. In Finland, citizens can initiate a process for legal change by petition. In August 2019, the Minister of the Interior Maria Ohisalo also suggested looking into removing EGMs from public spaces (HS 12.8., 2019; MTV3, 12.8.2019).As in Italy, the Finnish media was also initially critical of EGMs. However, unlike the Italian case, the debate in the Finnish press appeared to consider a wider network of stakeholders in EGM policy while the role of journal-ists remained marginal. The main proponents of removals were citizen activists (MTV3, 20.3.2019), researchers (HS 14.8.2019; HS 16.8.2019), and a few politicians (HS 25.11.2018). Their main argument was to reduce gambling-related harms particularly amongst lower income groups (MTV3, 12.8.2019; HS 16.8.2019). A citizen opinion poll from 31 August 2019, reported widely across the media (IL; KSML; YLE; MTV3; HS 31.8.2019)showed that 60% of Finns were willing to move EGMs from noncasino locations to separate gambling arcades. Some members of parliament (MPs) also supported removing EGMs from public spaces. Based on an opinion poll amongst MPs, those connected to the gambling monopoly Veikkaus were more likely to be against EGM removals than MPs without any relationship with Veikkaus (IS, 17.8.2019). One-quarter of Finnish MPs disclosed a connection with Veikkaus, either as members of the Veikkaus board or via their positions in associations benefitting from revenue generated by Veikkaus (IS,17.8.2019). The most vocal stakeholders against the removal of EGMs were representatives of the redistribution network (IL 15.8.2019; MTV3, 16.8.2019; HS 26.8.2019). In Finland, supermarkets, kiosks, and restaurants receive commissions for providing gambling products, including EGMs (YLE 15.2.2020; IL 15.2.2020). The main argument in support of EGMs was the revenue from machines particularly for smaller shops and restaurants and the ensuing effects on employment (IL 15.8.2019; HS 26.8.2019).",

            "text": "The Centre for Research on Addiction, Control, and Governance (CEACG) at the Faculty of Social Sciences, University of Helsinki, obtains a substantial portion of its annual operating budget from the Finnish Institute for Health and Welfare (THL). These funds emanate from hypothecated gambling taxes (legal agreement, the Ministry of Social Affairs and Health charges the costs of research from Veikkaus). In the past, JN has received remuneration from a charity lottery and travel reimbursement from the Finnish Association for Gaming Research. VM has also received funding from the Finnish Association for Gaming Research. The association (now defunct) obtained its funding from Finnish gambling monopolies. SR and GM have no competing interests to declare.",
