Data were recorded for 1year post transplant. Associations between RVI and continuous and categorical risk factors were assessed using W|lcoxon's rank-sum and w 2 tests, respectively. Associations between time to RVI and risk factors or survival were assessed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Of 576 subjects, 79 subjects (14%) had 101 RVI in the \u00a2rst year post transplant. Subjects with RVI were younger than those without RVI (median ages 9.7, 13; Po0.01).V|ruses detected included adenovirus (n 5 25), in\u00a3uenza (n 5 9), respiratory syncytial virus (n 5 21), parain\u00a3uenza virus (n 5 19), enterovirus (n 5 4), and rhinovirus (n 5 22). In a multivariable model for time to \u00a2rst RVI, etiology other than cystic \u00a2brosis (CF), younger age, and no induction therapy were independently associated with risk of RVI. Cytomegalovirus serostatus and acute rejection were not associated with RVI. RVI was independently associated with decreased 12-month survival (hazard ratio 2.6, 95% con\u00a2dence interval 1.6^4.4). RVI commonly occurs after pediatric lung transplantation with risk factors including younger age and non-CF diagnosis. RVI is associated with decreased 1-year survival.",

Data were recorded for 1year post transplant. Associations between RVI and continuous and categorical risk factors were assessed using W|lcoxon's rank-sum and w 2 tests, respectively. Associations between time to RVI and risk factors or survival were assessed by multivariable Cox proportional hazards models. Of 576 subjects, 79 subjects (14%) had 101 RVI in the \u00a2rst year post transplant. Subjects with RVI were younger than those without RVI (median ages 9.7, 13; Po0.01).V|ruses detected included adenovirus (n 5 25), in\u00a3uenza (n 5 9), respiratory syncytial virus (n 5 21), parain\u00a3uenza virus (n 5 19), enterovirus (n 5 4), and rhinovirus (n 5 22) . In a multivariable model for time to \u00a2rst RVI, etiology other than cystic \u00a2brosis (CF), younger age, and no induction therapy were independently associated with risk of RVI. Cytomegalovirus serostatus and acute rejection were not associated with RVI. RVI was independently associated with decreased 12-month survival (hazard ratio 2.6, 95% con\u00a2dence interval 1.6^4.4). RVI commonly occurs after pediatric lung transplantation with risk factors including younger age and non-CF diagnosis. RVI is associated with decreased 1-year survival.",

In a second multivariable model, the receipt of induction therapy was found to be protective against RVI (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35, 0.96, P 5 0.03) while age younger than 15 years and etiology other than CF remained signi\u00a2cant risks. Prior episodes of CMV, episodes of acute rejection, and home-going immunosuppression including the use of cyclosporine were not signi\u00a2cantly associated with subsequent RVI in the multivariable models.",

However, despite advances in surgical care and management, the pediatric mortality rate post lung transplant has remained relatively unchanged and is among the highest rate of all pediatric solid organ transplant procedures. RVI represents a potential obstacle to achieving improved outcomes. Previous studies have demonstrated that RVIs occur in many adult lung transplant recipients and have been associated with post-transplant morbidity including BOS. In a small cohort of pediatric subjects, adenovirus infection was associated with graft failure and death (7 ) . However, the current scienti\u00a2c literature lacks a com- 24) , RVI occurred in 13.8% of the pediatric subjects in this cohort. The seasonal variation of the viruses encountered re-\u00a3ects that seen in the general pediatric population. Clinicians should be aware of circulating community acquired viral infections to assist not only with the prepara-tion of the patient for hospital discharge but also with evaluation of patients who return with acute illness. In addition, the viruses recovered are similar to those reported in previous studies (8, 9) . Rhinovirus, which until recently was recovered with conventional viral culture, comprised a signi\u00a2cant proportion of the RVI (20%), similar to that reported in adults (9) . This re\u00a3ects the importance of testing method, as newly available molecular testing becomes more widely available for respiratory specimens to detect not only rhinovirus but also other emerging viruses such as coronavirus and human metapneumovirus (9, 24, 25) . Risk factors for RVI have not been previously evaluated after lung transplantation. In this cohort, younger age at the time of transplant, absence of induction therapy, etiology other than CF, and a cyclosporine-based immunosuppressive regimen were identi\u00a2ed as independent risk factors for the development of RVI within the \u00a2rst year following lung transplantation. Younger age and etiology of transplant are both independently signi\u00a2cant risk factors without evidence of an interaction. Younger children may be at increased risk for RVI for several reasons including immunologic naivety and increased exposure to infectious peers as seen in the general population. In addition, the proportion of subjects with adenovirus o3 years of age was signi\u00a2cantly higher than the older cohort. Although this study did not distinguish primary adenoviral infection from reactivation of latent virus, younger children have been shown to harbor virus at higher levels in their tonsils that reactivated after in vitro stimulation (26) .This provides another potential mechanism for increased risk of RVI in young transplant recipients. The observation that young age is associated with RVI development contrasts with what has been observed with pulmonary fungal infections in pediatric lung transplant recipients, where an older age is an independent risk factor. This suggests that patients may be at risk for distinctly di\u00a1erent infections based on the age at transplantation.",

The types of infecting agents, and most importantly impact, are signi\u00a2cantly di\u00a1erent between the 2 classes of RVI; RVI of the lower tract have been reported to carry more serious risks for subsequent mortality and rejection post transplant (8) . Unfortunately, the locations of the RVI could not be accounted for in this study owing to limitations in the availability of information, speci\u00a2cally the site of specimen collection for viral culture and diagnosis. In addition, the exclusion of clinical episodes along with the lack of routine screening protocols for RVI during the period for which data were collected likely underestimates the actual incidence of RVI in this population. Underestimation of RVI, especially if more severe episodes were detected, may overestimate the impact of RVI in this population. A prospectively collected cohort, including molecular evaluation for all symptomatic episodes, is in process. The duration of viral shedding was not addressed in the study; however, reports in the literature indicate that viral shedding for both rhinovirus and RSV may be prolonged in transplant recipients (27^29). Clinicians should consider this possibility with continuation or recurrence of symptoms after an RVI. Although nosocomial and community-acquired RVI were not speci\u00a2cally delineated in the data collection, a signi\u00a2cant number of early nosocomial infections were detected with the analysis of a large subset of subjects for which duration of transplant hospitalization was known.

Although infection is the most serious complication beyond 1 month but o1 year post transplant, it remains a potentially serious complication regardless of the time since transplant. Limiting analysis of outcomes to 1 year post transplant may have censored the true occurrence of RVI in the patient population. Furthermore, it is possible that the relationships reported between RVI and pretransplant risk factors and negative outcomes, such as chronic graft rejection and/or retransplantation, may not manifest within the \u00a2rst year post transplant, limiting the ability to identify signi\u00a2cant associations. In this case, the HRs of the univariable and multivariable Cox proportional models may be arti\u00a2cially low. Moreover, truly signi\u00a2cant risk factors and events may have been excluded altogether. In addition, the impact of newer RVI therapeutics such as cidofovir (for adenovirus) and ribavirin (for RSVand human metapneumovirus) may impact the outcome related to treated RVI (30^32).
