By ensuring preservation of portal venous blood flow to the liver, this procedure has advantages over portosystemic shunts, preserving liver function and deterring development of postoperative hepatic encephalopathy. In a Japanese series, the original Sugiura procedure had a rebleeding rate of less than 10% [16] . Several modifications of the original Sugiura procedure have been reported, including left gastric vein ligation, with different results [7, [17] [18] [19] . Likely because of a difference in the proportion of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, these modifications have not been successfully adopted in the Western countries [4, 6, 20] . Being a one-stage abdominal approach, the modified transabdominal Sugiura operation also consists of a simultaneous transection of the distal esophagus with a circular stapler introduced into the esophageal lumen through a gastric incision. Total esophageal transection to interrupt the transmural and paraesophageal varices was firstly performed by Walker [21] ; later, Johnston [22] described the use of a stapler device gun in an abdominal esophageal transection.
