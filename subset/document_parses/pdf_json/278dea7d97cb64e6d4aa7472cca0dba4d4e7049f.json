They conducted research through approaches of viral morphology, molecular biology, serology, and animal studies in 13 network laboratories throughout nine countries (five were in China). On April 16th, the WHO declared that a new coronavirus, dubbed \"SARS-CoV,\" was the pathogen causing SARS (WHO, 2003b) . Although epidemiology and experimental results have shown that SARS-CoV comes from animals, further research is necessary to determine the major animal reservoir from which the pathogen derives.",

Combining the application of approved reagents, including the detection of viral nucleic acid, protein antigen, and serum viral antibody, the SARS infection could be detected in its early stages (i.e., within approximately 1 week of infection) (Ministry of Health, People's Republic of China, 2005; Che et al., 2004) .

Nowadays, infectious diseasesespecially acute and severe ones transmitted via respiratory and intestinal tractsmay appear as either newly emerged infectious diseases or weapons in biological terrorism. Since such diseases usually emerge in an explosive and indiscriminate manner and have wide spread impact, they often lead to panic, social disorder, and economic trauma. Historically, severe epidemics had sometime changed war outcomes, wreaked social disorder, and altered political regimes. Considering these grave potential impacts, the establishment of a response system to severe infectious diseases should be given significant priority in the response system of sudden public health incidents. Acute and severe viral infectious diseases generally do not have specific and effective prevention and treatment measures; therefore, emergency response, prevention, and control need to be given the top priority. 2. The most significant revelation from the SARS outbreaks is that the response system to emergency public health events is inadequate. In the epidemics, weaknesses in China's command system, information system, prevention and treatment teams, and corresponding material storages were completely exposed. For the past two decades, the public health service in China has lagged behind, primarily due to inadequate funding. To solve these problems is an essential step for China to build a harmonious modern society with long-term lasting and equilibrating economic development. The establishment of China's CDCcentered nationwide laboratory monitor network, epidemic information network, emergency teams, and material storage is an essential component in building up the national response to public health emergencies. 3. No consummate public reporting institution of epidemic is observed. In the beginning of the epidemic, the policy of \"strict inward while loose outward\" concerning SARS blocked the epidemic information. The mystery of epidemic disease hovered among the public. Information was not transparent and blocked between related CDCs and researchers, even among departments of government including China and international organizations. This delayed the timely control of the epidemic and even initiated a confidence crisis among the public. It is essential to develop a complete system to announce and report epidemics -a scientific system to analyze and explain epidemics so that various departments can coordinate control of the epidemic and so that the public can correctly understand the epidemic and positively support the measures that the government takes to contain the epidemic.

No epidemic formed, largely due to the developed firm means of preventing the outbreak. The same prevention and control measures were applied in nine laboratory SARS infections in Beijing. Upon learning that two suspected SARS cases in Anhui came from a certain research institute in Beijing, related experts were quickly sent to Anhui on 21st April. Beijing also found SARS suspected cases at the same day. That afternoon, Beijing SARS network laboratory test results confirmed the clinical diagnosis of SARS. Meanwhile, epidemiological analyses suggested connections between Anhui and Beijing cases, and additionally circled the potential range of those who had come into close contact with the infected patients. The Beijing government publicized the outbreak according to emergency preparedness planning on 23rd April and followed up with decisive measures to close up the epidemic sites, quarantine close contact persons with patients, and give quick treatments to patients (Government of Xuan Wu Qu, Beijing, 2004). The firm reactions blocked successfully the transmission of SARS.

In monitoring ecological balance, a society must practice strict regulations in handling wild animals, for many diseases may be transmitted from animals to humans. Livestock and poultry, for instance, live in close contact with human beings and thereby create multiple areas for the transmission of common diseases such as the flu and Japanese B encephalitis.
