Rates of mortality and hospitalization are highest among those of racial and ethnic minority persons, including Latinx persons. Further, Latinx persons have been experiencing elevated mental health problems in response to the pandemic compared to non-Latinx Whites. The current study examined whether individual differences in anxiety sensitivity (AS) related to more severe emotional distress associated with social distancing, financial strain, fear of COVID-19, and physical health symptoms stemming from the COVID-19 pandemic among Latinx adults. Methods Participants included 188 Latinx persons (31.4% female, M age = 34.1 years, SD = 8.16) recruited via an online survey panel program. Results Results indicated that AS significantly contributed to increased severity of the emotional stress response associated with social distancing (\u0394R 2 = 0.15, p < 0.001), financial strain (\u0394R 2 = 0.15, p < 0.001), physical health symptoms (\u0394R 2 = 0.03, p = 0.006), and fear of COVID-19 (\u0394R 2 = 0.15, p < 0.001). These effects were evident over and above the variance accounted for by gender, years living in the United States, education, and work and home life COVID-19-related stress. Conclusions These cross-sectional findings suggest AS may be an important individual difference factor for better understanding mental health among Latinx persons in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Structural barriers such as xenophobia and immigration enforcement influence health seeking behavior by means of increasing mistrust for governmental agencies across Latinx generations (Cardoso et al., 2020; Gulbas & Zayas, 2017) . These factors can influence the willingness and readiness for Latinx persons to seek treatment for physical and mental health symptoms during and following the COVID-19 pandemic (Page et al., 2020) . Among those with immigrant family members or of immigrant status themselves, higher levels of anxiety may exacerbate these concerns and delay speaking to medical professionals (Berk & Schur, 2001) . These data are compounded by low rates of Spanish speaking health professionals and lack of culturally tailored resources for this population (Mutchler et al., 2007) . Moreover, factors such as essential worker status (Waltenburg et al., 2020) , financial strain (Garey et al., 2017) , and poverty impact the rate of COVID-19 exposure many Latinx persons experience (Resnick et al., 2020) , as individuals are unable to take time from work to rest when ill (Farrell & Venator, 2012) , or socially distance themselves from coworkers (Gould & Shierholz, 2020) . Indeed, the influence of such societal determinants of health are well documented in past work (Kouyoumdjian et al., 2003) and must be considered within the scope of COVID-19, as they intertwine with risk of exposure, infection, treatment, and overall health outcomes associated with COVID-19 among Latinx (Resnick et al., 2020) .",

Approximately 40.8% of Latinx persons reported elevated symptoms of an anxiety or depressive disorder between July 16-21, 2020 compared to 29.2% for non-Latinx Whites (Czeisler, 2020; Roll et al., 2020) . The emotional distress (e.g., anger, sadness) that emerges as a result of social distancing from family members and friends may be particularly difficult for those of the Latinx community due to the value placed on close relationships and familial bonds across the culture (e.g., family cohesion; Rivera et al., 2008; Zapata Roblyer et al., 2017) . Other work indicates that Latinx persons are experiencing higher COVID-19 related trauma, substance use, and suicidal ideation compared to non-Latinx Whites (Czeisler, 2020) . Stress related to COVID-19, in conjunction with continued and prolonged minority stress, and anxiety associated with 'regular stressors' such as racial/ ethnic discrimination may disturb the Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal (HPA) axis (Smith & Vale, 2006) and result in greater strain on an individual's wellbeing. This perspective is in line with the allostatic load theory, which suggests chronic stress can be associated with negative physical and mental health outcomes (McEwen, 1998 (McEwen, , 2004 . As such, the additive effect of COVID-19-related disease and stress burden exerted on stress responses systems, that are likely already saturated by pre-COVID chronic stress, may result in worse short-and long-term mental health outcomes among the Latinx population. Yet, there is highly limited data on factors that may be associated with a more severe COVID-19 stress response or emotional distress symptoms (e.g., anger, sadness, fear; Kleinberg et al., 2020) among Latinx persons.",

            "text": "One clinically and theoretically relevant individual difference factor for heightened stress responsivity is anxiety sensitivity (AS). AS refers to the fear of anxiety and high arousal-related symptoms based on the expectation that such symptoms have negative somatic, social, or psychological consequences (Reiss et al., 1986) . AS is a primary threat appraisal construct and serves as an 'affect amplifier' (Bernstein et al., 2009) , and is a consistent and robust predictor of psychological distress in work conducted among largely non-Latinx White persons (Bernstein et al., 2009; Schmidt & Zvolensky, 2007) . Individuals higher in AS are more hypervigilant of arousal symptoms and interpret these symptoms as a sign of 'imminent personal danger,' which can exacerbate the severity of mental health symptoms such as anxiety (Zinbarg et al., 2001) . Some work suggests that the AS construct may hold relevance to the Latinx community because this group tends to maintain a 'somatic orientation' for health problems (Canino, 2004; Huynh, 2012; T\u00f3foli et al., 2011) , such that fears of internal symptoms among Latinx persons increase the severity of mental (Bakhshaie et al., 2019) and physical health symptoms (Manning et al., 2019) . In fact, available pre-COVID-19 empirical work among Latinx persons has found that AS is related to poorer mental and physical health outcomes (Velasco et al., 2016) , including greater anxiety and depression Jardin et al., 2018; Zvolensky et al., 2015a Zvolensky et al., , 2015b . As an amplifier of negative affect, AS may serve to (theoretically) exacerbate emerging feelings of anger, sadness, and fear in terms of COVID-19 related financial worry, social distancing guidelines, and the outbreak of infection (Kleinberg et al., 2020) . Indeed, prior work has noted that the subjective internal experience of anxiety symptoms can lead to increased risk for developing panic disorder and anxiety psychopathology severity (McNally, 2002; Wearne et al., 2019) , and similar results have been found among Latinx persons (Varela et al., 2007) . Based on this work, there is theoretical justification to evaluate the relevance of AS in terms of mental health among Latinx persons in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. One recent study found AS was cross-sectionally and prospectively related to poorer COVID-19 mental health among Spanish-speaking adults from Argentina (Rogers et al., in press) . No studies, however, have focused on Latinx persons from the US in the context of AS and COVID-19 outcomes, or explored the importance of AS in terms of COVID-19 specific emotional impact or severity of physical health symptoms. It is theoretically plausible that AS may be related to the greater internal distress associated with COVID-19 stress response to social distancing, financial strain, and perceived threat of COVID-19 as well as COVID-19 related physical health symptoms among Latinx persons from the US.",

As the pandemic continues and in view that future non-COVID-19 pandemic will occur, the current data help inform how individual differences in anxiety sensitivity may be important to understanding the psychological impact of pandemics. Indeed, the results were consistent with expectation. Specifically, AS was a statistically significant cross-sectional predictor of emotional impact of COVID-19 social distancing and economic adversity as well as physical heath symptom severity and fear of COVID-19. Across models, AS explained between 3 and 17% of unique variance, indicating small to moderate effects. Moreover, these incremental effects were evident after adjusting for other theoretically and empirically relevant factors of gender, years living in the US, education, and work and home life COVID-19-related stressors. Such effects are notable given that each of the models accounted for significant variance in each of the criterion variables (Abelson, 1985) . Thus, there is likely a high degree of clinical importance to the role of AS in terms of emotional stress related to COVID-19 and the severity of physical health symptoms. These results are in line with non-COVID-19 research among the Latinx population which has found that AS is related to poorer mental and physical health among this population (Zvolensky et al., 2015a (Zvolensky et al., , 2015b ) and a previous longitudinal study among adults from Argentina (Rogers et al., in press) .",

The current results empirically document that AS is one such psychological mechanism. Social distancing is the first line of behaviorally-based protection against COVID-19 (Behar-Zusman et al., 2020; Marroqu\u00edn et al., 2020) , but for some Latinx persons, isolation from family members may be particularly stressful. Familial expectations, such as caretaking for family members above oneself, multigenerational households, and providing financially for one's family potentially place greater strain on Latinx persons amidst social distancing guidelines and high rates of job loss (Saenz & Sparks, 2020) . Future work could usefully evaluate whether such cultural and familial expectations moderate AS in terms of COVID-19 emotional distress and physical health symptoms. The AS construct may function to increase the financial strain and fear of COVID-19 in a similar way. As rates of COVID-19 infection and unemployment increase among Latinx persons (McCormack, 2020) , AS may serve to increase an individual's vigilance toward such threat stimuli, exacerbating the severity of emotional symptoms. AS emerged as a significant predictor toward greater health symptom severity among Latinx adults in the current investigation. This finding is in line with research that documents the close interconnection between emotional and physical health (Yao et al., 2020) . It is possible AS is associated greater vigilance to somatic perturbation, which increases the severity of physical symptoms. 1 Future research using attentional bias methodology (e.g., identifying and reducing levels of AS) would be a useful next research step in terms of better understanding the nature of AS in terms of the experience of physical health symptoms.",

First, education level emerged as a statistically significant predictor for all criterion variables, such that higher education level was associated with greater emotional impact of COVID, greater fear of COVID-19 and more physical health symptoms. These results suggest higher education levels are linked to COVID-19 related a range of psychological outcomes among Latinx persons. It is possible that higher education is related to greater awareness of COVID-19 health risks via access to COVID-19 media or scholarly work, thereby helping to explain the higher education finding. Second, COVID-19 exposure not surprisingly was related to three of the four models. These data add to growing literature that suggests greater COVID-19 exposure is associated with worse the mental and physical health outcomes (Gallagher et al., 2020) . Moreover, most of the sample was comprised of non-immigrant Latinx persons. These data further support pre-COVID-19 work that highlights the vulnerability to negative mental health risk among Latinx born within US (Cervantes et al., 2013; Pe\u00f1a et al., 2008) . Further work that focuses on a larger sample of varying Latinx subgroups is needed to establish the generalizability of the current findings more firmly.",

COVID-19 has been related to an increase of psychological distress and psychiatric symptoms (Gallagher et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2017) . Given the observed effect of AS in relation to increased psychological distress among Latinx persons, assessing for levels of AS may help identify which Latinx persons are at greatest risk for developing psychiatric symptoms and disorders in the longer term. Once identified, it may be possible to target AS via cognitive-behavioral methods in brief or extended treatment formats to reduce COVID-19 mental and physical health burden among the Latinx population. Indeed, existing work suggests that AS may be targeted using attention bias methodology (Hunt et al., 2006) , particularlyas it relates to understanding health anxiety levels (Lees et al., 2005) . Capturing the degree of \"threat\" that is attributed to otherwise neutral environmental stimuli may serve beneficial in two ways: (1) by providing corrective feedback, and (2) by providing psychoeducation on the adaptive functioning of physical anxiety sensations and not as an indicator of immediate environmental, social, or physical health threat (Otto & Smits, 2018) . This framework has not yet been evaluated among Latinx populations.",

            "text": "The current results must be considered in the context of study limitations. The present study utilized a sample of Latinx persons from an online recruitment sample due to in person data collection restrictions due to COVID-19. Moreover, the current sample endorsed a high level of preexisting health conditions, a relatively high education level (54.8% reporting attaining a bachelor's degree or higher compared to a reported average of 11% among general Latinx samples; Schak & Nichols, 2016) , and no information was attained over empirically related variables such as generation and immigration status. Therefore, this sample cannot necessarily be considered a representative sample of all Latinx persons within the US Future work could seek to further generalize the present results. Specifically, these data may prove most applicable to those that are US born. As one example, research might benefit from evaluating psychological distress and stress response among low income Latinx populations, as such psychological disturbances are evident among Latinx population wherein socioeconomic resources, insurance coverage, and mental health stigma stand as common barriers to adequate care (Doty, 2003; Mutchler et al., 2007; Rastogi et al., 2012) . Second, the assessment approach involved the utilization of self-report instruments. Future research could usefully replicate and extend the present findings using a multimethod approach to capture cross-system perspectives on the studied processes. Third, the cross-sectional nature of the current work limits the ability to establish causal relationships or determine how psychological distress may evolve over time. Future longitudinal research is needed to test the role of AS in terms of COVID-19 mental and physical health relations among the Latinx population.",
