Outbreaks of EV-A71 and EV-D68 have been recently reported worldwide, sometimes related to severe clinical outcomes. Objective: To describe EV genetic diversity and the clinical outcomes from paediatric patients attended at a tertiary university hospital in Barcelona (Catalonia, Spain) from 2014 to 2017. Study design: Specimens were collected from paediatric (< 17 years old) cases with suspicion of respiratory tract infection or EV infection. EV laboratory-confirmation was performed by specific real-time multiplex RT-PCR assay. Partial viral VP1 protein was sequenced for genetic characterisation by phylogenetic analyses. Results: A total of 376 (7%) from 5703 cases were EV laboratory-confirmed. Phylogenetic analyses of VP1 (210; 81%) sequences distinguished up to 27 different EV types distributed within EV-A (82; 40%), EV-B (90; 42%), EV-C (5; 2%), and EV-D (33; 15%), in addition to 50 (19%) rhinoviruses. The most predominant were EV-A71 (37; 45%) and EV-D68 (32; 99%). EV-A71 was highly related to neurological complications (25/39, 63%), of which 20/39 were rhombencephalitis, and most EV-D68 (28/32, 88%) were associated with lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI), and exceptionally one (3%) with acute flaccid paralysis. Conclusions: EV-A71 and EV-D68 were the most detected EV in respiratory specimens. EV-A71 was highly related to neurological disease and EV-D68 was often associated with LRTI.

Despite their low prevalence, all EVs are considered to be neurotropic [33] and therefore, they should be subject under surveillance. A relevant percentage of specimens confirmed as EV using the multiplex PCR-based assay (19%), were finally characterised like RVs. The high genetic similarity between RVs and EVs is an important factor that affects the specificity of diagnostic molecular methods, which are specially designed to distinguish between both viruses [11] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 213, "end": 217, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 218, "end": 222, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 223, "end": 227, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 228, "end": 232, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 368, "end": 372, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 446, "end": 450, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 838, "end": 842, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, the present study reports the virological and clinical surveillance of EV in a tertiary hospital in Spain from 2014 to 2017.
