However, there can be COVID-19 case without any signs and symptoms, which makes the control of these pandemics challenging (Rothe et al., 2020) . Geriatric population and people with severe comorbidities such as Asthma, Chronic kidney disease (CKD), chronic lung disease, Diabetes mellitus, Hemoglobin disorders, Immunity deficiency, Liver disease, Serious heart conditions, Severe obesity might be at higher risk of poor clinical outcome (NCIRD, 2019; Guan et al., 2020) , increased hospital stays (Zhou et al., 2020) and higher case fatality rate (Deng et al., 2020) . Along with increasing severity and mortality, these comorbidities might be associated with the incidence of COVID-19, since the immune system and systemic metabolism of the body are already compromised owing to these pre-existing conditions. For instance, Diabetic patients are more prone to infectious diseases due to impaired glycaemic control, which limits humoral immunity (Joshi et al., 1999; Shah and Hux, 2003) . Furthermore, the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is increased in Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes mellitus as well as in hypertension, and the coronaviruses bind with target cells through ACE2 (Fang et al., 2020) .",

This dataset is under the \"Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0)\" license. In order to preserve the confidentiality of the participants, several measures were ensured, such as e-mail address, I.P. address, date of birth was kept private as well as timestamp and location data were randomly adjusted. The survey questionnaire was comprised of 30 questions regarding sociodemographic, behavioral, morbidity, clinical, and diagnostic information related to COVID-19, and the survey was conducted in English (Nexoid, 2020) . Sample recruitment was done using an unrestricted self-selection method. The participants were invited through different social media platforms such as Facebook, Reddit, etc. The participants reviewed the privacy statement and agreed to participate in the study. A total of 780,961 people filled the online survey, and among them, 1516 people were diagnosed with COVID-19. A survey map was generated using the I.P. location data of the participants using the QGIS application (version 3.4.11) (Fig. 1 ).

The study compared COVID positive patients (cases) with controls and found a strong significant association with age, sex, and critical comorbidities (diabetes, kidney, liver, heart diseases, and hypertension). Though the majority of the survey participants were male (67.39%), the number of positive cases among females were pretty evenly closed (45.58%) with males. Several studies confirmed that the percentage of men suffering from this virus is higher than women (Nahian Rahman, 2020). However, our study found women were more prone to infection, and the multivariate logistic regression reveals females were 1.69 times (AOR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.52-1.87) more likely to get infected by Covid-19 in contrast to male participants. However, this finding does not bode well with one study, which inferred women were less susceptible to this virus than men based on a different innate immunity, steroid hormones, and factors related to sex chromosomes (Conti and Younes, 2020) . These contrasting findings must put more debate on this unknown condition in which the world is trying to get an answer. One population-based study conducted in Iceland between 31st January to 31st March also found a lower incidence in females and children under ten than males (Gudbjartsson et al., 2020) Age was also found to have some effect, and participants over 60 years of age had a marginally higher risk (AOR:1.36; 95% CI: 1.16-1.6) than their younger counterparts though only around 14% of participants were above 60 years. Most of the participants were from the age group under 40 years of age, possibly because they are more accustomed to online surveys and use. The possible explanation for the higher risk of COVID-19 in the geriatric population is that most of the geriatric people dwell in nursing homes or old homes, which can trigger rapid transmissibility. One study conducted on Israeli patients concluded that younger individuals have less chance to experience severe symptoms, which requires intensive care unit hospitalization, and the recovery rate was on average faster than the older aged patients (Voinsky et al., 2020) . Another study in China during the first half of February 2020, expressed a serious concern, which entails that older age and a high number of comorbidities were associated with higher severity irrespective of gender. However, men's cases tended to be more critical than women's .",

These findings also contrast with one study conducted in Mainland Chain, which found hypertension as the most prevalent (16.9%) comorbidity among 1590 confirmed hospitalized COVID patients between 11th December to 31st January 2020 and another study on the Chinese population during late January 2020 revealed that hypertension was even more common clinical manifestation (30%) .",

However, the number of COVID cases among kidney disease patients was low. It matches one article published in Nature Reviews Nephrology, which stressed that its involvement might result in multiple organ dysfunction and severe outcomes (Ronco and Reis, 2020 ). An understanding of the pathophysiology and mechanisms of kidney damage is still under scrutiny, and effective treatment is still not established (Ronco et al.) . Hence, it should be taken very seriously. Our study reveals that participants with kidney problems had 9.39 times (AOR: 9.39; 95% CI: 5.94-14.85) more chance of being infected with the virus than others, and this trend of increased chances was observed with other comorbid conditions though in a lesser degree. Our findings of diabetes, another common clinical comorbidity, coincide with the results of other studies . From the result, it appears that having physiological problems of different kinds had a serious aggravating effect as it increases the likelihood of getting infected by a novel coronavirus because of the weak immune system, which is susceptible to infection. Moreover, having comorbidities also correlated with poorer clinical outcomes in COVID patients . Note: The percentages may not add up to 100% due to missing data. *Age was classified: Below 60 years and above 60 years; Below 60 years were set as the reference for binary logistics regression. \u2020Male gender was set as the reference. \u2021People who are not diagnosed with the disease were set as the reference.",

Because of the unavailability of biochemical tests, the accuracy and validity of the data are questionable. For example, there was no option to confirm whether the participants were COVID-19 positive or not. Furthermore, the RT-PCR COVID-19 detection test can also be false positive or false negative for a variety of reasons (Tahamtan and Ardebili, 2020) . Secondly, most of the study participants are from North America, Europe, and South America, but there is a current galloping trend of infection and fatality in Asia. These findings may not apply to the population of these parts of the world. The online survey requires more knowledge, technological skills, and logistics. The people from low and middle-income countries and older adults lack the logistics and technological skills for participating in these studies.",
