The presence of dust grains in ISM have also been observed, which in the denser regions are covered by thick ice mantles consisting mainly of water molecules. Quantifying the interaction of gas phase species with water ice is essential to accurately model the evolution of the ISM. Hence, the importance to obtain accurate binding energies. In this contribution, the binding energies (BEs) of different N-containing interstellar species on water ice surfaces are presented. They have been calculated by means of reliable periodic quantum chemical simulations. Two different methods have been used: i) hybrid DFT methods, i.e., B3LYP for closed-shells species and M06-2X for open-shell radicals, and ii) the cost-effective DFT//HF-3C, i.e., geometry optimization at HF-3c followed by a single point energy refinement at the DFT level. As a first step, BEs have been computed on a crystalline water ice surface model of a thickness of 12 atomic layers, in which different super cells have been adopted (involving 36 or 72 water molecules per unit cell), depending on the size of the adsorbate. Moreover, an ONIOM-like local approximation combining CCSD(T) with DFT functional as high and low theory levels, respectively, has been adopted to correct BEs.",

Binding energy (BE) values are input parameters of paramount importance in the gas-grain astrochemical models as they dictate ice accretion, surface diffusion and desorption events, which are fundamental elementary physico-chemical processes in the grain surface chemistry. One of the major current problems is the lack of accurate molecule/ice BE values [8] . Temperature programmed desorption is the usual technique to determine BEs experimentally, but laboratory experiments present severe limitations as they are not capable to reproduce neither the actual interstellar conditions nor realistic ice grain analogues [10] . This leads to obtain unreliable BEs, which is a dramatic drawback in astrochemical modelling, and hence the importance to accurately quantify the interaction between gas-phase species and ice surfaces.",

One quantum chemical method is the novel cost-effective HF-3c, in which the electronic energy is grounded on the Hartree-Fock framework, but three corrections are added in a posteriori way [11] . Two DFT functionals have also been used: B3LYP for closed-shell species and M06-2X for radicals open-shell species. Both methods are hybrid DFT functionals as they incorporate a certain amount of exact exchange, 20% and 45%, respectively [12] [13] [14] . For B3LYP, the D3 empirical correction has been added to account for dispersive forces [15] . For both DFT functionals, the Ahlrichs TZV basis with polarization functions were used, while for HF-3c the MINIX basis set was used. HF-3c values do not suffer from the basis set superposition error (BSSE) but DFT values do. Accordingly, for these cases, single point energy calculations to obtain BSSE-corrected BE values have been performed [16] .",

For these calculations, we used the DFT optimized geometries. The surface mimicking the icy water dust grain has been modelled adopting a periodic approach. The water ice surface is based on the crystalline P-ice structure. P-ice is the proton ordered analogue to the hexagonal (proton-disordered) water ice, which has been demonstrated to reproduce fairly well the physico-chemical features of crystalline water ice [18] . The surface model has been generated by cutting out the P-ice 3D periodic bulk structure perpendicular to the [010] direction, resulting with the (010) slab surface model. We chose the (010) slab model because it is one of the most stable planes of the P-ice and because it has no dipole component perpendicular to them [19] . The slab model consists of twelve atomic layers and consists of 72 atoms (24 water molecules) per unit cell. It is worth mentioning that a structurally proper model based on the hexagonal ice (Ih) requires a large unit cell as all the proton arrangements must be covered. Indeed, as mentioned above Ih is a proton-disordered system. Since the position of the protons in the ice follows the Bernal-Fowler-Pauling (BFP) rules [20, 21] , i.e., i) each water molecule is oriented such that its two hydrogen atoms are directed approximately toward two of the four surrounding oxygen atoms arranged almost in a tetrahedron, ii) only one hydrogen atom is present on each O\u00c1\u00c1\u00c1O linkage and iii) each oxygen atom has two nearest neighbouring hydrogen atoms such that the water molecule structure is preserved, a structural model for Ih envisaging all the hypothetical proton-ordered configurations accounting the BFP rules would be very large and, accordingly, costly to treat at a quantum mechanical level. Because of that, using P-ice is a good compromise between accuracy and computational cost.",

Taking the O[CCSD(T)//DFT] BE values, the former group have BEs spanning the 70.4-35.1 kJ mol \u22121 range while the latter group the 29.2-13.8 kJ mol \u22121 range. This is because the Hb-AD species can establish more and more efficient H-bond interactions with the surface than the Hb-A ones. More Hbonds because for all the Hb-AD cases two H-bonds are established, i.e., one as Hbond donor and one as H-bond acceptor. This is not the case for Hb-A species, as they can only establish one or two H-bonds, in this later case the acceptor atom being the same. And more efficient H-bonds because the fact to act as both H-bond donor and acceptor enables H-bond cooperativity, which reinforces the H-bond network in which the adsorbate species is involved. This is reflected by the H-bond distances identified in both groups of species: Hb-AD species establish H-bond interactions of between 1.6-2.0 \u00c5, while Hb-A species of between 2.2-3.0 \u00c5 (at HF-3c theory level), meaning that this later group present weak H-bonds and accordingly dispersion is a major contributor to the BEs. In the Hb-AD group, HNC is the species presenting the largest BE value because it presents the strongest H-bond interaction (1.59 \u00c5 at HF-3c). In contrast, NH is the species with the lowest Hb-AD BE because their H-bonds are relatively weak (about 2.0 \u00c5 at HF-3c). In the Hb-A group, NO 2 presents the largest BE value because, being one of the largest molecules (and hence presenting large dispersion contributions), it exhibits the \"strongest\" H-bond (2.24 \u00c5) among the species of its group. In contrast, N has the lowest BE because the H-bonds are actually very weak (2.77 and 2.98 \u00c5 at HF-3c) and dispersion contribution is very minor as it is a single atom.",

This is due to the effects of the BSSE in the optimization at either full DFT or HF-3c theory levels. As mentioned above, optimized HF-3c geometries, which do not suffer from BSSE, generally present H-bond distances larger than the DFT optimized ones. Because of these larger H-bonds in the HF-3c geometries, the DFT single point energies provide lower BE energies than the DFT// DFT ones. Despite this fact, BE values obtained with the two methods are in almost perfect correlation, as one can see in Fig. 3 . Moreover, both methods also correlate very well with the BE values obtained through the O[CCSD(T)//DFT] approach (see Fig. 3 ), allowing us to conclude that the cost-effective DFT//HF-3c is a suitable method to obtain robust and accurate enough BE values. As a final interesting comment, we would like to highlight that B3LYP and M06-2X functional methods, based on the comparison with the O[CCSD(T)//DFT] approach, describe well the electronic structure of respective closed-shell and open-shell systems.

The main purpose is to assess the robustness of the cost-effective DFT//HF-3c approach (i.e., optimization at the composite HF-3c theory level followed by a single point energy calculation at DFT theory level) to calculate accurate BEs. To this end, DFT//HF-3c BEs have been compared to those provided at DFT//DFT as well as to those obtained through a CCSD(T) correction adopting an O [CCSD(T)//DFT] approach. The N-containing molecules considered here, in their adsorption on the water ice surface can act either as just H-bond acceptors (Hb-A, N, NO, NO 2 and N 2 O) or as Hbond acceptors and donors (Hb-AD, NH, HNO, NH 2 and HNC). Consequently, the latter group presents more favorable BE values than the former one. Indeed, while Hb-AD species establish relatively strong H-bond interactions with the surfaces, in Hb-Abased complexes H-bond interactions are relatively weak, leaving the major contribution to the total BE in the dispersive forces.",
