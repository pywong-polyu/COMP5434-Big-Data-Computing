The general features of these are similar to thyrotoxicosis cases reported in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of these forms of thyrotoxicosis have been reported with mRNA-based vaccines, what goes in line with our case-series, although we have to point out that some cases have also been described after inactivated SARS-CoV2 and vector-based vaccines [16, 17] . Nonetheless, it is important to highlight that in some patients, symptoms related with thyroiditis may have been identified as post-vaccination symptoms and, in consequence, many thyroiditis diagnoses may have been overlooked. Further investigations are needed to clarify these important concerns such as which is the real risk of thyroiditis depending on COVID-19 vaccine types.",

The majority of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 encode the viral spike protein, employing it as the antigen to lead to a protective immune response against SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies [16, 18] suggest that thyroid peroxidase peptide sequences in thyroid tissue share similarity with SARS-CoV-2 proteins. This could contribute to a cross-recognition between the modified SARS-CoV-2 spike protein encoded in RNA vaccine and the thyroid target proteins, due to molecular mimicry, leading to an autoimmune thyroiditis.",

This leads to the so-called Autoimmune/Autoinflammatory Syndrome Induced by Adjuvants (ASIA). It is difficult to ascertain the accuracy of this hypothetical autoimmune disorder as a pathogenic link between vaccination and thyrotoxicosis and it cannot be considered as a universally accepted pathogenic mechanism. Nevertheless, and on the basis of the literature review, it has been one of the most frequently repeated postulations. In this context, it is worth mentioning that at low rates and despite that case-control studies are still scarce, HPV vaccine has been related to primary ovarian failure [23] and to Guillain-Barr\u00e9 Syndrome [24] , albeit not implying a causal association. The difficulty in proving a causal relationship between the clinical manifestations of the diseases and the use of adjuvants in vaccines should be noted since several studies do not confirm the role of adjuvants in the development of autoimmune diseases [25] .",

In two patients of our case series the onset of symptoms ranged from 50 to 60 days. These two patients' diagnoses were Graves's disease. Literature review concerning cases reports in different countries regarding thyroid dysfunction after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination has shown a maximum time of onset after vaccination of 56 days [21] . In contrast and as it has recently been described [10] , subacute thyroiditis triggered not by COVID-19 vaccination but by COVID-19 infection, seemed to take place 2-3 weeks after viral infection, and classic subacute thyroiditis (postviral) usually occurs within 2-8 weeks following viral infection [16] .",

By October 2021 and following the Spanish vaccination strategy, 87.9% of the population over 12 years of age was already fully vaccinated [26] . In this context, we looked for the diagnoses of thyrotoxicosis performed in our Centre in the same period, resulting in 56. All 56 cases with a confirmed diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis had received at least one dose of the vaccine. Nevertheless, in no case did thyrotoxicosis occur before 8 weeks after vaccine administration, in contrast to our case series and to other cases in the literature. In any case, we would like to point out that despite the temporal sequence between the administration of the vaccine and the onset of symptoms, as well as the increasing number of cases being reported, the association in at least some of the described cases might be casual and simply chronologically associated with, albeit not caused by vaccination. In addition to this, it is noteworthy that following World Health Organization Immunization Safety Surveillance guidelines, an adverse event following immunization (AEFI) is defined as any untoward medical occurrence which follows immunization, which does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the usage of the vaccine [27] . Therefore, it is important to point out that thyroid disorders following COVID-19 vaccination represent a clinical event with a reasonable time relationship to vaccine administration, but that does not imply a cause-effect relationship [25] .",
