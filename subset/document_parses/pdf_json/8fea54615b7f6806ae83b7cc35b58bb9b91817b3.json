Its specificity for PCV2 antibodies appears to be high since pig blood samples seropositive for several common porcine viruses did not react with the PCV2 peptide. Moreover this peptide is not a PCV1 cross-reacting epitope since PCV2 antibodies did not react with its PCV1 counterpart which shared 80% of sequence identity. This peptide-based ELISA was thus highly specific to PCV2 in contrast to the differential IPMA or IFA reported by others [4, 5, 27] which used cross-reacting virion subunits as detection antigens.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 687, "end": 690, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 691, "end": 693, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 694, "end": 697, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "By studying the antibody response in experimentally inoculated pigs over a period of 11 weeks, we established that the B-133 peptide was a serological marker for PCV2 infection since all pigs had PCV2 antibodies at the end of the experiment. This serological marker is thus produced or detected relatively late since anti-B-133 antibody levels were undetectable during the first 2 weeks postchallenge although PCV2 antibodies were reported with IPMA of PCV2-infected cells or Orf2 western blot analyses [5, 27] in all inoculated pigs from the 14 th day post-inoculation onwards. These data suggest a lower sensitivity of the peptidebased ELISA which is assumed to be linked to the availability of antigenic sites. Actually virion proteins may exhibit several linear or conformational antibody binding sites compared to the 15-mer peptide. Kinetic studies showed a variability in seroconversion rate dependent on the pig's initial health since 66% of the conventional farm animals were seropositive 6 weeks post-inoculation compared to only 22% of the SPF animals. These differential antibody kinetics could be explained by the individual backgrounds of the pigs in terms of previous immunological stimulations. We have already observed, for example, that conventional farm pigs generally exhibit higher cellular immune responses than SPF pigs (unpublished data). The number (n) of positive sera and the % of seropositive individuals in each group of pig age are reported By studying the reactivity of the B-133 peptide with field pig sera, we established that it was also a serological marker for natural PCV2 infection since farm pigs kept in PMWS-affected herds had detectable PCV2 antibodies. Furthermore 26% of the farm pigs in PMWS-free herds were also seropositive and no reactivity was ever observed with PCV1 peptide. This absence of correlation between PCV2 seropositivity and the outcome of PMWS is fully consistent with previous reports [25, 26] . It can be assumed that other factors such as housing or management conditions, concurrent infections or even genetic factors are involved in the onset of clinical symptoms in herds. In particular, recent studies have shown that some management failures [18] or simultaneous infection with porcine parvovirus [4] may influence disease outcome.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 503, "end": 506, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 507, "end": 510, "text": "27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1948, "end": 1952, "text": "[25,", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1953, "end": 1956, "text": "26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2212, "end": 2216, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2267, "end": 2270, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "To date, the serodiagnosis of PCV2 infection necessitates cumbersome differential assays based on cell-cultured antigens. To our knowledge, no ELISA has so far been developed mainly because of the absence of immunological data concerning the virus. We have characterized certain of the linear B-cell epitopes of the Orf2-encoded protein from PCV2 and focused on an epitope designated B-133 to develop an ELISA. The most interesting feature of this easy-to-use assay is its PCV2 specificity since it seems to be less sensitive in antibody detection than a multiepitopic antigen. We have also identified two other relevant epitopes: a discriminant epitope (B-121) and B-146 which is apparently common to both circoviral types although no cross-reactivity has ever been observed from Orf2-encoded proteins. B-121 and its PCV1 counterpart share 80% amino acid identity while B-146 and A-202 share more than 86% sequence identity. These other epitopes could also be of interest in the serodiagnosis of PCV2 infection for example, in combination with the B-133 peptide or with the Orf2-encoded protein.", "cite_spans": [],
