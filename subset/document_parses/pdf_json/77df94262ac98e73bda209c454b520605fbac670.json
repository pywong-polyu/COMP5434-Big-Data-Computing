Resulting unemployment, income loss, poverty, and social isolation, coupled with daily reports of dire news about the COVID-19 pandemic, could serve as catalysts for increased self-harm deaths (SHD). This ecological study examined whether observed SHD counts were higher than predicted SHD counts during the pandemic period in the Canadian provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Qu\u00e9bec. The study also explored whether SHD counts during the pandemic were affected by lockdown severity (measured using the lockdown stringency index [LSI]) and . We used Poisson and negative binomial regression to assess ecological associations between the LSI and COVID-19 case numbers, controlling for seasonality, and SHD counts during the COVID-19 period. On average, observed SHD counts were lower than predicted counts during this period (p < 0.05 [except Alberta]). Additionally, LSI and COVID-19 case numbers were not statistically significantly associated with SHD counts.",

Therefore, clinicians and policymakers should understand the impact of COVID-19 and related risk factors on SHD, especially since COVID-19 is becoming endemic (Lavine et al., 2021) . We defined SHD as: (1) any act or behaviour leading to a fatal outcome; (2) a self-initiated act or behaviour; and (3) an act or behaviour performed with the intention or expectation of bringing about death (Andriessen, 2011) . Several papers reported increases in SHD following the start of the pandemic (Dsouza et al., 2020; Hill et al., 2021; Jenkins et al., 2021; Okubo et al., 2021; Sakamoto et al., 2021) .",
