With the background of public participation in social governance in the future, effective public participation is extremely helpful to solve this issue. Promoting public participation and scientifically evaluating the implementation effect of public participation are urgent problems to be solved at present. This study aims to analysis the factors hindering public participation and improve the implementation effect. Therefore, an evaluation system with 16 factors is established based on literature review and questionnaire survey, namely the basis of participation, participation process, external support, and cost-effectiveness. Interactions among the 16 factors are further evaluated by expert opinions. The objective and subjective weights of indicators are determined and combined by introducing Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory (DEMATEL) and entropy weight method (EWM). Considering the uncertainty and randomness of subjective judgment, cloud model is introduced to evaluate the implementation effect of public participation. Finally, this framework is applied to evaluate the project of Jiu Feng waste-to-energy (WTE) plant in Hangzhou, China, which verifies the applicability of the evaluation framework for the implementation effect of public participation in NIMBY facilities. The results indicate that the implementation of public participation is between \"average\" and \"good\", with significant room for improvement in the involvement of NGOs and the influence of public opinion on decision-making. Additionally, the participation process has a significant impact on the whole system. The framework can provide government departments with guidance in implementing public participation.",

In China, with the comprehensive deepening of reform, the urbanization level has increased from 36.09% (2000) to 63.89% (2021) and is expected to reach 70.99% in 2030 [1] . The accelerated urbanization has brought a massive increase in the urban population. To meet the growing needs of the citizens for production and life, the government has invested heavily in the a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 construction of production facilities, service facilities, and infrastructure. More and more large-scale public projects have begun construction, such as sewage treatment plants, garbage treatment plants, and power plants, which are beneficial to most people. However, these projects have negative impacts on the residents around the construction site, and are often not welcomed by the surrounding residents. Such projects with obvious negative external effects are defined as NIMBY facilities [2] . As the most common NIMBY facilities with the highest NIMBY effect, polluting NIMBY facilities are more likely to trigger public sensitivity and resistance due to their greater potential danger and pollution. At the same time, people's democratic consciousness and cognitive level gradually increase, they believe that the construction and operation of these facilities produce environmental pollution, which may adversely affect the living environment and health. Therefore, NIMBY conflicts are increasing yearly, no matter in developed or developing countries, collectivism institution or democracy institution [3] [4] [5] . For instance, more than a decade of conflict between Hazardous waste management and public resistance in Portugal [4] , nearby residents took to the streets in revolt due to building the Hubei Yangluo WTE plant in 2019. Regarding the resolution of the NIMBY conflicts, Ibitayo believed that public participation is a prerequisite in the construction of NIMBY facilities [6] . Public trust and early, continuous participation in the facility siting process can increase the likelihood of successful siting [7] . Yong Liu [8] also pointed out that public participation is an effective means for the government to improve the public acceptance of waste incineration facilities by residents. And the government should provide more opportunities for the public to participate in decision-making [9, 10] . Studies above have shown that the necessity of public participation has been universally recognized [11] , and public participation can reduce conflicts caused by NIMBY and protect public interests. Moreover, public participation can improve decision ability of decision-makers [12] , then to make them know the public's concerns [13] .",

            "text": "Public participation is essential to solving NIMBY conflicts [11] . Measuring the implementation effect of public participation and reaching high effectiveness in public participation has consistently drawn the attention of researchers. Sun et.al [14] took Shanghai and Hong Kong as examples, adopted qualitative methods to measure the implementation effect of public participation, and suggested that key stakeholders should be involved in improving the level of public participation. Rowe and Frewer [15] established a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of public participation methods, mainly from the acceptance criteria and process criteria, but the research remains at the level of qualitative discussion. Some scholars [10, 16] also formulated a zoning framework for discourse power during the site selection, construction, operation, and final abandonment of NIMBY facilities to maximize the participation of public groups. Unfortunately, most scholars focus on promoting public participation. They fail to quantitatively measure the implementation effect of public participation, which leads to lack of persuasiveness. There are several outstanding problems. Firstly, although research results are relatively abundant in identifying the influencing factors of public participation, the research on the evaluation index system of the implementation effect of public participation in the decision-making of NIMBY facilities is limited. Secondly, characteristics of NIMBY facilities vary with different types [17] , and few researches focus on polluting NIMBY facilities, which conflicts account for more than 60% in China. Therefore, it is necessary to select polluting NIMBY facilities as case study. Finally, most researches adopt the qualitative analysis method in the evaluation, but few quantitative studies are available. The qualitative analysis has intense subjectivity and poor assessment findings. Consequently, it is still a worthy research topic about the implementation effect of public participation and what hinders public participation in the decision-making process of polluting NIMBY facilities. This research can fill the gap.",

China's research on NIMBY facilities started relatively late and was initially introduced into the mainland by Taiwan scholars. Since then, many scholars in China have carried out a localized definition. Li interpreted it as a project that can serve most people, but because it may threaten health, living environment, life, and property so that residents do not want to build projects near their homes [18] . He recognized that NIMBY facilities are usually referred to as some facilities with pollution threats, such as thermal power plants and landfills, etc [2] . Yang [19] believed that NIMBY facilities refer to facilities unwilling acceptable locally, but are indispensable for realizing social public welfare. The classification of NIMBY facilities by scholars is different from different perspectives. As shown in Table 1 , several categories are summarized.",

Therefore, this paper selects polluting NIMBY facilities as a case study and defines them as facilities that are potentially dangerous and polluting to the surrounding environment and produce air, water, soil, and noise pollution during their construction or operation, such as waste-to-energy plants, garbage treatment plants, sewage treatment plants, chemical plants, etc. ",

The government thinks the introduction of public participation inevitably affects the achievement of the economic goals [21] , and fails to pay attention to the feedback from the public, which eventually leads to the forced relocation of the project [22, 23] . Yu et.al [24] suggested changing the previous public participation model, from the traditional government-led model to the public-led model, which can convey the public's interests to decision-makers. As the initiator and supervisor of the construction of NIMBY facilities, government departments should establish a tripartite communication channel among nearby residents, construction companies, and the government, which can effectively promote the development of NIMBY facilities [8] .",

The limitation of public representatives cannot represent the general public, ultimately leading to ineffective participation [12] . Participation skills [27] and procedural processes directly impact the effectiveness of public participation. Furthermore, whether the relevant information is open and transparent in the decision-making process of NIMBY facilities also has a significant impact on public participation [28] . To fundamentally improve public participation at the present stage is to enhance their awareness of environmental protection and focus on carrying out environmental protection education [29] . Participation mechanism, technology choice, and economic factors are necessary to enhance the willingness to participate [30] . Online participation methods can also be added, such as online questionnaires, public symposiums, and debates through video conferencing [31] . While reducing the cost of participation, online participation methods enable the public to express their opinions more truthfully. In conclusion, public participation can improve the scientific nature of environmental planning, make it more accurate to reality, improve the implementation ability of the plan. Accordingly, strengthening legislation [14] and establishing engagement guidelines [32] , providing multiway interaction and training, and conducting education programs are all necessary to enhance the effectiveness of public participation.",

The factors of \"social and economic status of the public\" and \"public's understanding of NIMBY facilities\" were removed, as they could be summarized by \"public awareness of participation\". Finally, 16 influencing factors were determined, and the questionnaire was designed using the above influencing factors (S2 File). A total of 240 questionnaires were distributed, 223 were recovered, and 218 were valid after processing, with an effective recovery rate of 90.83%. After collecting and sorting out the questionnaire data, the basic descriptive statistics obtained are shown in Table 4 . The questionnaires were filled by relevant government departments, NIMBY facility construction enterprises, the public, environmental assessment departments and Non-Governmental organizations. Their working years ranged from less than five years to more than 15 years, with broad coverage and reliable results. The information of the respondents is presented in Table 5 . In order to establish the index system for evaluating the implementation effect of public participation in the decision-making of NIMBY facilities, this paper uses factor analysis to reduce the dimensionality of the influencing factors. Factor analysis is a multivariate statistical analysis method that describes multiple observable and related variables with a small number of non-observed obtained factors, and we apply SPSS 22 for factor analysis. After testing, Cronbach's Alpha = 0.713, KMO = 0.736, the approximate chi-square value of Bartlett's sphere test is 879.264, Sig = 0, indicating that the sample data in this study is suitable for factor analysis. To extract common factors and classify indicators, this paper uses principal component analysis to analyze the covariance matrix of independent variables. In this process, the Kaiser-Rule-Thumb was widely used, and this method takes the components with eigenvalues greater than 1 as principal components, because the contribution of factors with eigenvalues less than 1 may be small. According to the degree of variance explanation, four common factors with eigenvalues greater than 1 are finally selected. As shown in Table 6 , the degree of variance interpretation is 56.567% > 50%, which shows that the selected four main factors can represent more than half of the information of the original evaluation index. Therefore, they can be used as the main factors affecting the implementation effect of public participation.",

To achieve a scientific evaluation of the implementation effect of public participation, it is particularly significant to assign weight to the index reasonably. The determination of weight directly affects the accuracy of the evaluation results. The current research mainly includes subjective and objective weight, but their mechanisms are disparate, and the evaluation results also have their advantages and disadvantages. Subjective weight relies too much on the opinions of experts and is affected by personal knowledge, while objective weight only focuses on mathematical-statistical methods and ignores the influence of people. Therefore, to highlight the critical role of expert experience and consider the objective information reflected by the index data, this research combines the two methods. For the analysis of public participation implementation effect, DEMATEL is an enormously advantageous method, which can consider the influence of factors synthetically. In order to calculate indicator weights more scientific and rational, EWM, which is an objective weighting method, is introduced to correct the DEMATEL results. 4.1.1. DEMATEL method. The DEMATEL method was developed by the U.S. National Laboratory from 1972 to 1976. It mainly solves complex social problems in real life by comprehensively combining the knowledge and experience of experts in related fields [41] . This method employs matrix tools and graph combination methods to analyze the interaction degree of indicators in the evaluation index system [42] . By analyzing the logical relationship and influence matrix between the indicators in the evaluation system, the influence degree between each indicator and other indicators can be obtained. Furthermore, we also acquire the centrality and cause degree of each indicator [43] . The steps to determine subjective weights based on the DEMATEL method are as follows.",

At the same time, compared with the traditional evaluation methods, it is more consistent with objective facts. Li et al [51] through comparative research of cloud model, fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method, and BP neural network model, showed that the evaluation results obtained by cloud model are more accurate. In recent years, the cloud model evaluation method has been applied to the field of management. Some scholars have introduced the cloud model into the evaluation of investment. For example, Liu et.al [52] built a new energy investment assessment framework based on the cloud model. In addition, some scholars used the cloud model to evaluate risk. For instance, Yu et.al [53] evaluated the risk of submarine pipeline, using the VIKOR method is extended with the cloud model to determine the risk priority of failure modes. Abundant research results provide a certain reference for this paper. The evaluation of the implementation effect of public participation in the decision-making of NIMBY facilities is a complex problem, influenced by many factors, with uncertainty, fuzziness and randomness, and the cloud model can manage this problem well.",

The cloud map composed of cloud droplets in the cloud model is represented by three numerical values, denoted as C(Ex, En, He). Expectation Ex is the most representative point of qualitative concept in the domain space. It is reflected on the cloud map as the \"highest point\" of the cloud, that is, the point whose membership degree is 1. Entropy En is used to measure the degree of uncertainty of a qualitative concept, which is jointly determined by the randomness and ambiguity of the concept. The larger the entropy, the stronger the vagueness of the concept, and the more difficult it is to quantify it. The reflection on the cloud map indicates the \"span\" of the cloud, that is, the greater the entropy, the larger the \"span\" of the cloud. Hyper-entropy He represents the uncertainty of entropy, and it also indicates the randomness of the sample, namely the dispersion degree of cloud droplets on the cloud map. He correlates ambiguity and randomness, which is reflected on the cloud map to represent the \"thickness\" of the cloud. The greater the super entropy, the thicker the cloud.",

In addition, other indicators with smaller Ex and larger En or He have big room for improvement, which is mainly due to the fact that the current public participation is in the primary stage and the public only participates symbolically. Therefore, when selecting public representatives, the coverage of different groups should be fully considered, and the government should pay attention to forming a positive interaction with the public.",

Compared to other organizations, environmental NGOs are third-party organizations that are decoupled from government interests and not directly involved with public interests, and their position is more impartial. Introducing them into the project decision-making stage can reduce public concerns. At the same time, compared with the general public, NGOs have stronger expertise and ability. On the one hand, they can convey the government's wishes to the public, on the other hand, they can help the public integrate their internal opinions and convey them to the government, serving as a two-way communication bridge between the government and the public, thus better guiding public participation, avoiding deviations in the public's individual behavioral intentions, and promoting the healthy development of public participation. However, due to the difficulties of insufficient funding, social resources, and the lack of actual administrative authority and legal protection, Chinese environmental NGOs are currently small in scale and struggle to play a large role. Therefore, the government should support NGOs from the object environment and give them more autonomy so that they can carry out their activities comfortably within the lawful scope and form a culture of pluralistic co-governance between the government and NGOs. In addition, the government should strengthen the capacity building of the main body of NGOs and guide them to enhance participation capacity by participating in dispute coordination meetings and providing advice and environmental knowledge to the public, so as to alleviate the public's over-exaggerated environmental anxiety, improve their credibility in the public's mind.",

In this paper, the first-level indicators are made to change \u00b110%, \u00b120% and \u00b130%, respectively, to simulate the change of decision makers' preference for different indicators under disparate situations, and compare the impact of these changes on the evaluation result cloud, red, green and blue respectively represent the cloud of \u00b110%, \u00b120%, and \u00b130% change of indicators. In Fig 8, the evaluation result clouds all change slightly during the sensitivity analysis, but the closeness is still between average and good, which proves that the evaluation model proposed has good stability and scientific validity. Combining the comparison between the graphical and digital features of these evaluation clouds, it can be seen that although the evaluation results are stable under each change, the change in index C1 has a more obvious impact on the results, which is due to the fact that the component containing the indicator is more important. Meanwhile, the evaluation results all change with the four indicators, and the cloud thickness and dispersion are larger for a 30% increase in weight, which is caused by the larger value of the resultant cloud.",

The BWM was proposed by Rezaei J in 2015 [55] , in which experts (decision-makers) select the best (most important) and worst (least significant) criteria based on experience and actual engineering needs, and then compare the best (worst) criteria with each of the remaining indicators in turn. After comparison, each indicator will form an integer value from 1 to 9, reflecting the relative degree of superiority or inferiority. Finally, the BWM solution can be transformed into a mathematical planning problem, and the results can be calculated using Lingo software. Kumar P et.al [56] explored the challenges in sustainable supply chain of electric vehicle batteries and determined the priority of these challenges by using the BWM method. Kusi-Sarpong S et.al [57] adopted a multi-criteria decision-making method to evaluate and select sustainable suppliers, using weights determined by BWM to rank the suppliers. At the same time, the BWM has also been applied in many cases, such as choosing the right place to set up temporary hospitals for Covid-19 patients [58] , assessing renewable energy potential [59] , evaluating the risk of PPP waste-to-energy incineration plant projects [60] , and assessing energy security performances [61] .",

Although BWM can obtain roughly the same weights, they cannot deal with the interrelationship between criteria and cannot overcome the human factor of subjective assignment. Compared with the above-mentioned method, our proposed method can take into account the influence relationship between indicators, which can incorporate the theories and experiences of senior experts, while striving to reduce the subjective arbitrariness of the assignment and make the evaluation results more realistic.

Based on the characteristics of NIMBY facilities, this research constructs an evaluation index system for the implementation effect of public participation through literature review and questionnaires. In order to make the weights more reasonable, DEMATEL and EWM are provided to get the combined weights of factors. To a certain extent, it can overcome the disadvantages of subjective weight. Furthermore, the method can analyze the causal relationship among the factors influencing the implementation effect. It can be found that the basis of participation and external support factors significantly affect other factors, while the participation process and costeffectiveness factors are prominently influenced by other elements. Finally, a case is selected to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new model. It not only considers the uncertainty of evaluation factors but also takes into account the fuzziness of evaluation criteria, which can obtain more intuitive, accurate, and objective results. We provide a quantitative evaluation method to promote public participation in the decision-making of NIMBY facilities. This paper found that the awareness of public participation has been awakened in polluting NIMBY facilities. However, the participation process lacks continuity and the interaction with the government is insufficient. To solve this problem, different groups should be fully considered when choosing public representatives. At the same time, relevant government departments should make full use of the Internet platform, build a scientific and convenient platform for public participation, and open special participation channels. In addition, with government support, there are reasons to believe that NGOs will play a more significant role.",

Secondly, the collected data mainly come from subjective scoring. Although using the cloud model can reduce the subjectivity of scoring results to a certain extent, the lack of objective indicators may still cause the evaluation results to be incomplete. In the following research phase, the identification method of the factors influencing the implementation effect of public participation can be innovated. Some objective and quantitative evaluation indicators, such as the number of hearings held and the expenditure related to the public involvement, can be added to the evaluation index system to make it more scientific, comprehensive, and better reflect the implementation effect of public participation.",
