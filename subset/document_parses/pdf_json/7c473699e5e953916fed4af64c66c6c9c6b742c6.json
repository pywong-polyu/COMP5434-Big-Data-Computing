Lack of specific treatment of COVID-19 disease demands urgency in drug design against SARS-CoV-2 targets. Nigella sativa the miraculous herb native to South and Southwest Asia and belonging to the family Ranunculaceae, due to its beneficial bioactive properties, was used by us for performing in silico study to analyze the potential of its compounds so that they can target and inhibit SARS-COV-2 proteins including its main protease, the papain-like protease, its helicase, and also the RNA-dependent RNApolymerase, RNA-binding protein, Endoribonuclease, receptorbinding domain, and the RNA-binding domain of nucleocapsid phosphoprotein. The procedure of molecular docking was done with the help of AutoDock-Vina 1.1.2. and along with it the ADMET properties of the best suited ligands were found and Lipinski screening was performed. Among 58 ligands screened, various compounds showed binding energy less than the standard drug chloroquine. Three compounds alpha-hederin, rutin, and nigellamine A2 had the least binding energy with the specific SARS-Cov-2 proteins suggesting their best potential as SARS-CoV-2 inhibitor. Hence, in the future, studies including the in vitro and also the in vivo studies can be carried out for analyzing their true potential and encourage use of nutraceuticals like Nigella sativa to inhibit this virus.",

Structural analysis of the coronavirus receptor-binding domain revealed that to bind on to the cell of host on its receptor, few residues are crucial for them for receptors like the Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [2] . The virus enters the cell of host with help of spike protein then releases the nucleocapsid, which during life cycle of virus provides significant functions and the viral genome after disassembling. The SARS COV2 possesses 16 non-structural proteins (Nsps), out of which functions of few are known. Nsp5-which is main protease (3CLpro) is found to be responsible for transforming the polyproteins into Nsps by cleavage and also the protein named papain-like protease (PLpro) is responsible for the same which is followed by construction of replication-transcription complex [3] in which the major role is played by proteins like RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. The protein helicase has also been found to play important role for the same. Additionally, the non-structural proteins that have been found to play key roles in replication include Nsp-9-RNA-binding protein [4] and with the innate immune response, the protein Nsp15-Endoribonuclease played important role in protein interference [5] .",

Lack of specific treatment of COVID-19 disease demands urgency in designing of drugs to inhibit the targets of the SARS-CoV-2. Benefits of nutraceuticals for prevention and treatment of various diseases has encouraged their use. Growth of herbal dietary supplement retail sales have seen swift increase in recent years. One such nutraceutical Nigella sativa due to its beneficial bioactive properties was used by us for in silico study to analyze their potential compounds for SARS-COV-2 protein inhibition.",

Keeping this and the benefits of Nigella sativa as nutraceutical in mind, we investigated inhibitors of the SARS-COV-2 proteins using 58 Nigella sativa compounds and used main proposed drug chloroquine for comparison. Various compounds interacted well with the SARS-CoV-2 proteins among which the least binding energy was showed by compounds alpha-hederin, rutin, and nigellamine A2.",

The molecular docking results of this study and the beneficial properties of these bioactive compounds encourage the use of these natural compounds from Nigella sativa for potential inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 in conditions where specific therapies have not been found for the COVID-19 disease and the main proposed drugs are costly and may not be available to underprivileged sections of the society. Natural compound availability is easy; they cost less and people have more knowledge and belief in natural remedies having less harmful effects when compared to conventional synthetic medicines.

Results obtained by molecular docking showed that the compounds from Nigella sativa could bind effectively with the SARS-CoV-2 proteins, giving same or better energy scores compared to the proposed drug and may inhibit SARS-CoV-2. The Nigella sativa ligands that showed least binding energy with SARS-CoV-2 targets were alphahederin, rutin, and nigellamine A2. The ADMET and Lipinski analyses of the compounds also revealed their drug likeness. The best suited compounds alpha-hederin, rutin, and nigellamine A2 can be studied further in the future by performing in vitro and in vivo studies to analyze their true potential and encourage use of nutraceuticals like Nigella sativa to design drugs for inhibitingSARS-CoV-2.
