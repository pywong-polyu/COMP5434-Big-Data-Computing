            "text": "The timing and sequence of safe campus reopening has remained the most controversial topic in higher education since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. By the end of March 2020, almost all colleges and universities in the United States had transitioned to an all online education and many institutions have not yet fully reopened to date. For a residential campus like Stanford University, the major challenge of reopening is to estimate the number of incoming infectious students at the first day of class. Here we learn the number of incoming infectious students using Bayesian inference and perform a series of retrospective and projective simulations to quantify the risk of campus reopening. We create a physics-based probabilistic model to infer the local reproduction dynamics for each state and adopt a network SEIR model to simulate the return of all undergraduates, broken down by their year of enrollment and state of origin. From these returning student populations, we predict the outbreak dynamics throughout the spring, summer, fall, and winter quarters using the inferred reproduction dynamics of Santa Clara County. We compare three different scenarios: the true outbreak dynamics under the wild-type SARS-CoV-2, and the hypothetical outbreak dynamics under the new COVID-19 variants B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 with 56% and 50% increased transmissibility. Our study reveals that even small changes in transmissibility can have an enormous impact on the overall case numbers. With no additional countermeasures, during the most affected quarter, the fall of 2020, there would have been 203 cases under baseline reproduction, compared to 4727 and 4256 cases for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants. Our results suggest that population mixing presents an increased risk for local outbreaks, especially with new and more infectious variants emerging across the globe. Tight outbreak control through mandatory quarantine and test-trace-isolate strategies will be critical in successfully managing these local outbreak dynamics.",

            "text": "More than half a million cases of COVID-19 have been reported at United States colleges and universities since the beginning of the pandemic. Although many students, staff, and faculty have been immunized since vaccination became available in December 2020, more than 120,000 of all cases have occurred since January 2021 [21] . This is alarming, especially in view of the newly emerging variants of COVID-19 that are more infectious, and potentially more dangerous to the younger population [4] . American institutions of higher education remain faced with a difficult choice: maintaining campus life while exposing staff and students to a dangerous disease, or closing the campus at the risk of educational, mental, and financial disruption [19] . In most cases, university administrations soon realized that the risks of maintaining normal in-person learning during the pandemic were too grave and switched to an all-online instruction. Stanford University was the first major university to announce this transition on March 6, 2020. Within the following week, many colleges and universities sent home their students and by April 4, 2020, 1,400 university campuses had been closed [20] . While it became rapidly clear that campuses would not reopen for the remainder of the academic year, the next major question was to decide on possible reopening for the fall of 2020, especially in the light of the increase in prevalence among young adults. Indeed, young adults aged 20 through 29 years contributed substantially to the increase in COVID-19 infections across the southern United States during June 2020 [1] .",

To model the effect of campus opening, we allow students to travel back to Stanford campus using our network SEIR model. We investigate campus opening for the spring quarter on April 6, 2020, the summer quarter on June 22, 2020, the fall quarter September 14, 2020 and the winter quarter January 11, 2021. For each quarter, we estimate the effects of opening by assuming the dynamic reproduction number (t) of Santa Clara County, that we infer directly from the local COVID-19 outbreak data from Santa Clara County. To model the effects of three different virus variants, in addition to the baseline simulation, we consider the B.1.1.7 variant with an increased transmissibility of 56% and the B.1.351 variant with an increased transmissibility of 50% [4] . For both virus variants, we scale our inferred effective reproduction number of Santa Clara by multiplication with the increased transmissibility and perform forward simulations for all four quarters, spring, summer, fall, and winter. Figure 2 illustrates the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in the United States from the beginning of the outbreak until January 17, 2021. For each state, the bottom graph represents the new confirmed cases I(t) as dots and our inferred dynamic SEIR model fit \u00ce (t) as orange curves. The shaded regions represent our inferred 95% credible interval on the daily new cases. The top graph represents the inferred evolution of the effective reproduction number (t) . The solid lines describe the median values of (t) and the shaded areas represent the 95% credible intervals. The side-by-side comparison of all 50 states showcases the different disease dynamics and the varying timing of the COVID-19 waves in each state. While most states saw high effective reproduction numbers and a strong increase in new COVID-19 cases during the months of November and December 2020, the early outbreak dynamics displayed larger regional differences in waves between the individual states. These differences are of particular interest for informing the intrinsic risk that inviting students back to campus entails for a university campus like Stanford. For example, New York had a large outbreak at the beginning of the pandemic but managed to keep its effective reproduction numbers low until the end of the summer. In contrast, states like Arizona, California, Florida, Nevada, South Carolina and Texas saw a high regional COVID-19 prevalence by the end of June 2020, around the time Stanford's summer quarter was about to start. To invite undergraduates from all of the United States back to campus, we need to consider the epidemiological status of each states at the time a new quarter starts, which is showcased in Fig. 3 . The left plot summarizes the effective reproduction number variation and the right plot showcases the exposed and infectious population sizes throughout all the states at the beginning of each quarter. Figure 3 shows that, at the beginning of the spring, summer, and fall quarters, most states across the United States saw imminent outbreaks with effective reproduction numbers well above one. At the same time, the relative sizes of the exposed and infectious populations were still relatively small. At the start of the winter quarter, the opposite situation occurred as most states were recovering from a new COVID-19 wave. Reproduction were well below one in most states, but the relative exposed E and infectious I population sizes were still significantly larger than at the beginning of the other quarters.",

Table 1 summarizes the infectious and exposed populations in each state for each of these potential campus reopening dates. On April 6, the largest exposed and infectious populations were 0.43% in New York, 0.34% in New Jersey, and 0.20% in Massachusetts. Consequently, for the spring quarter, students returning from the East Coast had the highest chances of bringing COVID-19 back to campus. On June 22, we inferred a 0.35%, 0.22% and 0.20% exposed and infectious population in Arizona, Florida, and South Carolina. On September 14, students returning from North Dakota, South Dakota, and Wisconsin had a 0.41%, 0.29% and 0.26% chance to be exposed or infectious. On Jan 11, peak exposed and infectious populations were recorded at 1.04%, 0.93%, and 0.84% in Arizona, California, and South Carolina. These numbers clearly show the significantly higher risk in inviting students back to campus at the beginning of the winter quarter: The average exposed and infectious populations across all states were 0.54% at the start of the winter quarter, compared to 0.13%, 0.08% and 0.06% for the fall, summer, and spring.

The last five columns of Table 1 report the origin of Stanford University's current undergraduate population. Figure 4 showcases the inferred amount of exposed and infectious students returning to campus from each state. We estimate the COVID-19 influx by multiplying the state-specific prevalence with the number of students returning from each state, and summarize these values in Table 2 . For a potential opening in the spring quarter, we inferred one COVID-19 exposed or infectious student returning from New York, one from California, and one from New Jersey. For a summer opening, our results suggest that we could have expected three exposed or infectious students returning from California and one exposed or infectious student from Texas and Florida. For a fall opening, we would have seen two exposed or infectious individuals returning from California and one from Texas. At the beginning of the winter quarter, the high COVID-19 prevalence throughout the United States would have resulted in 24 exposed or infectious students returning from within the state, three from Texas, two from New York, and one from Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Washington, Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland, and Colorado each.

The bottom graph depicts the reported daily new cases I(t) as dots and our inferred dynamic SEIR model fit \u00ce (t) as orange curve. The shaded regions highlight the inferred 95% credible interval on the new confirmed cases. The top graph showcases the inferred temporal evolution of the effective reproduction number (t) in Santa Clara County, which serves as the input to our forward predictions in the following example. The solid lines describe the median values of (t) and the shaded area depicts the 95% credible interval. Similar to the state of California in Fig. 2 , Santa Clara County saw two significant COVID-19 prevalence waves, the first at the beginning of July and the second from early November to the beginning of December. Assessment of new B.1.1.7 Figure 6 represents a scenario for the wild-type SARS-CoV-2, where no new COVID-19 virus variants are brought into campus by the returning students. In this scenario, the amount of new cases per day within the first 100 days after campus reopening remains limited to a maximum of two students if Stanford University reopened in the spring of 2020. For the same scenario, we would expect a maximum of three, six, and five cases per day after reopening campus for the summer, fall, and winter quarters. In total, reopening for spring, summer, or fall quarter would have resulted in 58 cases, 162 cases, and 203 cases during the first 100 days after reopening. For reopening campus at the beginning of the winter quarter, a total of 86 cases would have to be expected by March 3, 2021. Figure 7 represents the scenario where returning students bring in the new B.1.1.7 COVID variant which has an increased transmissibility of 56%. In this scenario, our Fig. 3 Epidemiological status of the incoming student population for four consecutive quarters. Effective reproduction statistics and size of the exposed and infectious populations at the beginning of the spring, summer, fall, and winter quarters forward predictions estimate significantly higher daily confirmed case numbers compared to the previous scenario.

Most institutions have cautiously limited student access to campus throughout the first year of the pandemic, but are now gradually inviting their students back to campus. In view of massive immunization campaigns, it seems natural to assume that it would now be safe to now transition back to in person instruction. However, since the early outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, new and more contagious variants of the virus have emerged and COVID-19 is now beginning to spread predominantly into younger age groups. Taken together, these events bring back the question about safe campus opening.",

Bringing students back campus during the summer quarter under the B.1.1.7 COVID-19 variant scenario would have led to a more flattened outbreak curve peaking at 44 new daily cases on day 55. Reopening Stanford University for the fall quarter with the new B.1.1.7. variant circulating on campus would have led to a steep outbreak wave reaching a maximum amount of 158 new confirmed cases on day 81. Finally, reopening in winter would have generated a slow and controlled spreading. Within the first 52 days, the maximum amount of daily new daily cases would have amounted to 6 on day 50. In total, reopening campus under the reproduction dynamics of the new B.1.1.7 variant would have led to 3329, 2555, and 4727 cases 100 days after reopening for the spring, summer, and fall quarters. Figure 8 represents a similar scenario in which we assume that the new B.1.351. variant would be the dominant variant in the undergraduate population. Similar to the B.1.1.7 scenario, an increased transmissibility would have resulted in a steep wave when reopening campus at the beginning of the spring and fall quarters. More specifically, we could have expected 117 new cases on day 97 and 139 new cases on day 84 for the spring and fall quarters. A more flattened COVID-19 wave upon summer reopening would have peaked at 34 daily new cases on day 55. For winter quarter reopening, the amount of new cases would have stayed relatively constant at approximately four to five new cases per day during the first 52 days of the quarter. In total, the B.1.351 variant scenario predicts 2581, 2117, and 4256 cases 100 days after reopening for the spring, summer, and fall quarters and 237 cases 52 days after reopening for the winter quarter.",

We assume that the local outbreak dynamics on Stanford campus are driven by the effective reproduction number of Santa Clara County that we infer from the counties reported case data using Bayesian inference. Our study suggests that, with no additional countermeasures, the most affected quarter would have been the fall of 2020, with 203 cases under baseline reproduction, and 4727 and 4256 cases for the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants.Strikingly, the outbreak dynamics of the B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 variants are significantly different from those of the wild-type SARS-CoV-2 version. In fall, the wild-type curve increases monotonically until the end of the quarter. In contrast, for both variants, the outbreak curves peak towards the last third of the quarter, with 158 daily new cases for B.1.1.7 and 139 for B.1.351, and then steadily decline. This suggests that both variants are sufficiently infectious to create a state of herd immunity: A large enough group of students,",
