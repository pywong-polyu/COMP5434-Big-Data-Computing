SARS-COV-2 infection and induced cytotoxic and proapoptotic effects associated with abolished cardiomyocyte beating. RNA sequencing confirmed a transcriptional response to viral infection as demonstrated by the up-regulation of genes associated with pathways related to viral response and interferon signaling, apoptosis and reactive oxygen stress. SARS-CoV-2 infection and cardiotoxicity was confirmed in a 3D cardiosphere tissue models. Importantly, viral spike protein and viral particles were detected in living human heart slices after infection with SARS-CoV-2. Corona virus particles were further observed in cardiomyocytes of a patient with COVID-19. Infection of iPScardiomyocytes was dependent on cathepsins and ACE2, and was blocked by remdesivir.",

SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped and single-stranded RNA virus type, which mainly invades alveolar epithelial cells and causes adult respiratory distress syndromes. COVID-19 is associated with myocardial injury, as assessed by increased troponin T and NT-proBNP levels accompanying increased cardiovascular symptoms in a significant number of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [1] [2] [3] . Recent studies further demonstrate significantly reduced ejection fraction, higher left ventricular mass and raised native T1 and T2 assessed by magnetic resonance imaging in patients recovered from severe COVID-19 4 . Elevated levels of cardiac injury markers were associated with higher risk of in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients 5 . In patients showing clinical deterioration during COVID-19, left ventricular systolic dysfunction was noted in approximately 20 % of patients according to a most recent study 6 . In addition, patients with underlying cardiovascular disease represent a significant proportion of patients, who may suffer from severe courses after COVID-19 infections 7 . However, it is unclear whether elevated biomarkers of cardiac injury and long term effects on the cardiovascular system are directly caused by viral infection of cardiac tissue or are secondary to hypoxia and systemic inflammation during complicated COVID-19 courses. Earlier studies with cardiac tissue samples revealed mixed results. While one study did not find evidence for viral particles of the first SARS corona virus SARS-CoV 8 , SARS-CoV RNA was identified in 35 % of autopsied human heart samples obtained from patients who succumbed to the SARS crisis during the Toronto SARS outbreak 9 . Other studies suggest that the Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which has similar pathogenicity as SARS-CoV-2, can cause acute myocarditis and heart failure 10 . Moreover, substantial amounts of viral SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in human hearts of COVID-19 patients [11] [12] [13] [14] Although virus particles were identified in interstitial cells in myocardium of one patient 15 , direct infection in cardiomyocytes of COVID-19 patients has not been described yet.",

            "text": "/c). ACE2 protein expression was confirmed by immunostainings using two different antibodies in iPS-CM (Figure 1d, Online Supplement Figure Ib/d).Interestingly, ACE2 expression in cardiomyocytes was lower and ACE2 was localized more to cytoplasmic and perinuclear regions as compared to other TMPRSS2-positive cells such as the human CaCo-2 cell line, which is known to be highly permissive for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 infection[21][22][23] (Figure 1b, Online Supplement Figure Ie). However, membrane staining was occasionally detected in control and SARS-CoV-2 infected iPS-CM (Online Supplement Figure 1d, f; indicated by arrows). These data document that human cardiomyocytes possess receptor and activators described thus far necessary for effective SARS-CoV-2 infection, but show a lower expression and distinct localization of ACE2. hiPS-CM are infected by SARS-CoV-2 To test if hiPS-CM are directly targeted and are permissive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, hiPS-CM were infected with isolates of SARS-CoV-2 20 (Figure 2a). SARS-CoV-2 infected hiPS-CM showed increased intracellular double stranded virus RNA as demonstrated by immunostaining (Figure 2b, Online Supplement Figure IIa). Viral RNA in supernatants was further assessed by PCR and was dose-and time-dependently increased after infection with SARS-CoV-2 (Figure 2c-e). Consistently, the expression of the viral spike glycoprotein protein was detected in a time-and dose dependent manner after infection with different strains of the virus (FFM1 and FFM2 20 ) (Figure 2f-h, Online Supplement Figure IIc-d).Control experiments confirmed spike protein expression in \uf061-sarcomeric actinin-expressing cardiomyocytes(Figure 2i, Online Supplement Figure If). The supernatant of hiPC-CM contained fully infectious virus, as demonstrated by titration in CaCo-2 cells(Figure 2j)indicating that the virus undergoes full replicatory cycles in hiPS-CM. Interestingly, the frequency of beating was significantly augmented at 24h to 48h post infection, but was abolished at later time points(Figure 2k). SARS-CoV-2 infection reduced cell counts(Figure 2l) and augmented apoptosis in hiPS-CM(Figure 2m). Profound cytopathogenic effects were visible at later time points (96 h)(Figure 2h). However, cytotoxicity in cardiomyocytes was detected at later time points compared to CaCo-2 cells, which quickly round up and showed severe cytotoxicity at 24 h (Online Suppl.Figure IIe,f). RNA sequencing demonstrated that infected hiPS-CM showed a strong transcriptional response to viral infection including interferon activation(Figure 2n)and signatures of apoptosis and oxidative stress(Figure 2o).",

At 5 days post infection, cardiospheres showed a reduced size (Figure 3d) consistent with the induction of cell death.

            "text": "-f). Here, increased spike protein expression was shown in four different samples derived from three explants (Figure 4c-e). Infection was associated with morphological signs of tissue injury such as areas with loss of \uf061-saromeric actinin signal and disorganized structure compared to homogenous mock controls (Figure 4c). Spike protein expression was detected in\uf020\uf061sarcomeric actinin positive cardiomyocytes (Figure 4d). The virus was further identified in infected human heart tissue in cardiomyocytes by electron microscopy (Figure 4f, Online Supplement Figure IV). Of note, stages of the entire replicatory cycle were detected (Figure 4f, right panel). Finally, we detected SARS-CoV-2 in an endomyocardial biopsy of a patient with COVID-19. This 27-year-old patient was diagnosed with COVID-19 and suffered a complicated course of COVID-19 with severe lung injury and reduced right and left ventricular ejection fraction (see Online Supplement Method for more details). Virus particles were detected in cardiomyocytes associated with visible cytotoxic effects such as focal loss of myofibrils (Figure 4g).",

            "text": "Together, SARS-CoV-2 can infect human cardiomyocytes in culture as well as in two different models of cardiac tissue. Infection was documented by various read outs including intracellular viral double strand RNA and spike protein expression, as well as extracellular viral RNA. The virus was further detected by electron microscopy in cells of the infected human heart slices and in an endocardial biopsy of a COVID-19 patient. Importantly, functional virus could be isolated in supernatants of infected cardiomyocytes documenting that SARS-CoV-2 undergoes a full replicatory cycle. Of note, viral infection was confirmed with cells of two different hiPS-donors and two viral strains and our in vitro data are consistent with a recent online publication27 .The expression of the SARS-CoV-2 receptor ACE2 in cardiomyocytes was confirmed on mRNA and protein levels, but its localization was distinct from CaCo-2 cells. Although ACE2 could be detected at the cell membrane in some iPS-CM, it was preferentially detected in the cytoplasm and the perinuclear region(Figure 1d, Online SupplementFigure I). The preferential intracellular localization of ACE2 observed in cultured iPS-CM was similar to the staining pattern of human heart samples16 and may suggest that ACE2 is shuttling between the plasma membrane and intracellular compartments. Despite the relatively low membrane ACE2 expression, ACE2 was functionally required for virus infection. Thus, recombinant ACE2 and neutralizing antibodies against ACE2 blocked viral spike protein expression after SARS-CoV-2 infection.Whereas the receptor ACE2 was well expressed on mRNA and protein level, the previously described protease activator TMPRSS2 was very lowly expressed in hiPS-CM, suggesting that activation of the S-protein may be mediated by other cysteine proteases such as cathepsin L and B, which also can mediate viral activation22 . Indeed, the protease inhibitor ALLM, blocks cathepsin L and B26 , reduced viral spike protein expression. Viral infection was associated with cytotoxic effects and inhibition of beating of cardiomyocytes in our in vitro cultures and cardiospheres suggesting a potential detrimental effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the human heart. Interestingly, cardiomyocytes are less susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 infection and cytotoxicity compared to TMPRSS2 + CaCo-2 cells, which showed a faster and more severe cytotoxic response. These findings, if translatable to a clinical setting, may suggest that cardiomyocyte infection may only occur under conditions of a high local virus concentration and longer time exposure. Viral infection may be facilitated in patients with cardiovascular disease, due to the described augmentation of ACE2 expression and cardiovascular disease-associated vascular inflammation allowing infiltration of virusloaded immune cells. SARS-CoV-2 elicits a typical transcriptional response to viral infection including the activation of interferon pathways. Since we recently demonstrated that SARS-CoV-2 infection deregulates pathways involved in ER stress and protein homeostasis 21 , one may hypothesize that viral infection may induce ER stress leading to prolonged unfolded protein response and subsequent alteration in calcium homeostasis and cardiomyocyte cell death 28 . There is compelling evidence that patients suffering from COVID-19 show profound elevations of cardiac injury biomarkers and deteriorated right and left ventricular cardiac function, however, whether cardiac injury is directly caused by cardiomyocyte infection is unclear. Viral RNA has been detected at significant levels in cardiac tissue 11-14 and cardiomyocyte infection may occur during conditions of vascular leakage and tissue inflammation 29 . Our data showing virus particles in cardiomyocytes of a COVID-19 patient,further supports that viral infection can indeed occur. However, whether a direct infection is the main cause leading to the high incidence of cardiac involvement observed after COVID-19 4 is unclear. While viral RNA meanwhile has been detected in various studies[11][12][13][14] , only few cases reported the detection of the virus particle by electron microscopy in the heart but mainly in non-parenchymal cells15 . It is also debated whether COVID-19 induces myocarditis.While some studies document infiltration of inflammatory cells 4,14 , others did not find elevated inflammatory cytokines in cardiac tissue in autopsies of patients who died of COVID-1913 . Therefore, the incidence and consequences of SARS-CoV-2 infection of cardiomyocytes in human hearts deserves further studies. Our in vitro data may suggest that infected cardiomyocytes may undergo apoptosis, a transient process, which may lead to secondary replacement fibrosis but not necessarily inflammation. The profound induction of interferon pathways observed in our RNA sequencing analysis may further imply an anti-viral response in infected cardiomyocytes. However, theses in vitro experiments by no means can mimic the complex effects of the virus on cellular and systemic levels. Thus, it will be important to study the presence of corona virus particles and tissue morphology not only post mortem but in cardiac biopsies at the first time of increased troponin release, during the further progression and after recovery in order to gain insights into a potential relation of acute infection with cardiac injury.Finally, the used models can serve as experimental tools for further testing the effects of therapeutic strategies. Interfering with ACE2 by neutralizing antibodies or recombinant ACE2, which was previously shown to block infection of organoids25 , or inhibition of the RNA polymerase with remdesivir efficiently inhibited viral spike protein expression. Our findings showing that cathepsins and likely not TMPRSS2 are involved in infection of cardiomyocytes may support the testing of Cathepsin L inhibitors as recently suggested by Liu et al 30 .
