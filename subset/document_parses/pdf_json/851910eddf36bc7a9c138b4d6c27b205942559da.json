Here, we showed that MCP-1 and TNF\u03b1 cytokine levels were almost doubled in plasma from ERT-treated FD patients. Chemokine receptor CCR2 surface expression was increased by twofold on monocytes from patients with low eGFR. We also observed an increase in IL12B transcripts in unstimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) over a 2-year period of continuous ERT. Apabetalone is a clinical-stage oral bromodomain and extra terminal protein inhibitor (BETi), which has beneficial effects on cardiovascular and kidney disease related pathways including inflammation. Here, we demonstrate that apabetalone, a BD2-selective BETi, dose dependently reduced the production of MCP-1 and IL-12 in stimulated PBMCs through transcriptional regulation of their encoding genes. Reactive oxygen species production was diminished by up to 80% in stimulated neutrophils following apabetalone treatment, corresponding with inhibition of NOX2 transcription. This study elucidates that inhibition of BET proteins by BD2-selective apabetalone alleviates inflammatory processes and oxidative stress in innate immune cells in general and in FD. These results suggest potential benefit of BD2-selective apabetalone in controlling inflammation and oxidative stress in FD, which will be further investigated in clinical trials.",

            "text": "Fabry disease (FD) is a rare X-linked lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the GLA gene encoding the lysosomal enzyme \u03b1-galactosidase A (\u03b1-GAL). 1 These mutations result in deficient \u03b1-GLA activity and accumulation of globotriaosyceramide (also known as Gb3) and globotriaosylsphingosine (lyso-Gb3) in various tissues and cell types. Gb3 deposits activate pathogenic mechanisms such as harmful pro-inflammatory responses and oxidative stress, 2,3 subsequently leading to tissue injury in organs throughout the body including the heart and kidneys. Cardiovascular and renal dysfunction, which commonly manifest as cardiac hypertrophy and a decline in eGFR respectively, remain the leading causes of death in FD. 4, 5 Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), the standard of care for nearly 20 years, 6, 7 reduces Gb3 levels and improves clinical outcomes in the short term. 8, 9 However, ERT is less effective when tissue injury has developed and abnormal immune responses persist. 2 Activation of the innate component of the immune system by Gb3 through Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) triggers pro-inflammatory responses in FD. 10 Subsequently, activated innate immune cells (e.g., monocytes and neutrophils) produce deleterious inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, driving FD progression. Elevated levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) have been detected in FD patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) compared with healthy controls. 10 Increased plasma IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 levels also positively correlate with incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and cardiovascular disease (CVD). 11, 12 Furthermore, the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), involved in monocyte movement, is associated with CVD progression over 1 year of ERT, 12 while interleukin-12 (IL-12), a monocytederived T helper 1 (Th1)-type cytokine that promotes T cell responses, has been proposed to mediate abnormal T cell activity in patients with FD. 13 T cell appearance in damaged myocardium during long-term ERT 14 implies aberrant T cell infiltration which can result in further tissue damage.",

We also tracked cytokine expression in PBMCs from four FD patients with eGFR >60 (normal eGFR) on continuous ERT therapy before and after 2 years of treatment. PBMCs showed an ~20-fold increase in IL12B transcript levels (p = .03) in the most recent visit compared with 2 years prior ( Figure 1B) . Furthermore, activation markers on monocyte populations ( Figure 1C) were assessed. As shown in Figure 1D , the proportion of monocytes expressing CCR2 was greater in patients with low eGFR (eGFR <60, p = .03), implying that innate immune dysregulation may be associated with renal dysfunction.

MCP-3 is important for CCR2-mediated monocyte recruitment, 55 and GM-CSF promotes inflammatory activation of monocytes/macrophages. 56 We report increased GM-CSF in plasma from ERT-treated FD patients compared with controls (Table S2 ) and reduced production of both GM-CSF and MCP-3 with BD2-selective apabetalone (1 \u03bcM or 5 \u03bcM; Figure 3B ).

BETi, particularly BD2-selective apabetalone (1 \u03bcM and 5 \u03bcM), reduced ROS production in stimulated FD neutrophils ( Figure 7A and B) , and regulated transcription of ROS-related genes such as NOX2 ( Figure 7C ).

To date, work on BET protein involvement in ROS production has focused on fibrosis and cancer.

Therefore, generalized conclusions cannot be drawn without a larger study. Despite these limitations, we showed elevated inflammatory signaling in immune cells from FD patients over time, without clinical presentation or diagnostic signs of renal complications, such as abnormal eGFR. This persistent inflammation in FD patients regardless of ERT indeed warrants further validation in a greater number of patients. Furthermore, we were able to demonstrate the potential for apabetalone in countering inflammatory processes in activated immune cells in FD patients. Despite limitations, this study demonstrates that apabetalone could be a valuable therapeutic for improving FD patient care.",

Gb3 activates monocyte-derived cytokine production through the TLR4 pathway, albeit to a lesser extent than LPS. 10 This Gb3-mediated pro-inflammatory activation can be detected in cultured cells only in the presence of DGJ, 10 an \u03b1-gal inhibitor, that blocks its enzyme activity and thereby prevents the clearance of its substrates, such as Gb3, and thereby mimicking conditions in FD patient cells. Here, we observed differing transcriptional responses to various stimuli including Gb3+DGJ, LPS or IFN\u03b3 in THP1 cells. As shown inFigure 6, CCL2 expression was induced in all three stimulation conditions; however, the observed induction was lower with Gb3 + DGJ than with LPS or IFN\u03b3. Similarly, a subtle but significant induction was observed for TNF expression by Gb3+DGJ stimulation, but to a lesser extent than with LPS. Importantly, induction of both genes by Gb3+DGJ was downregulated by BD2-selective apabetalone treatment (apa 1 \u03bcM and 5 \u03bcM) and by pan-BETi (apa 20 \u03bcM and JQ1 1 \u03bcM).

These baseline results suggest that modulation of ongoing inflammation is necessary to complement long-term ERT.

We show that inhibition of BET proteins, particularly by BD2-selective apabetalone, attenuates pro-inflammatory responses in stimulated PBMCs from ERT-treated patients.

We show that BD2-selective BETi opposed induction of TNF expression at lower grade/chronic-like inflammatory levels seen with Gb3+DGJ stimulation in THP1 cells (53%-77% reduction by BD2-selective apabetalone [apa 1 \u03bcM, apa 5 \u03bcM] on twofold induced TNF, Figure 6) while pan-BETi suppressed induced IL6 in LPS stimulated conditions, analogous to acute inflammation (~24% reduction by apa 20 \u03bcM on >7500-fold induction by LPS) (Figure 4). Interestingly, apabetalone-driven inhibition of inflammatory signals at the protein level occurred only in FD patients with low eGFR (Figure S3), who showed higher production of TNF\u03b1, IL-6 and IL-8 in response to LPS (Figure S3). Therefore, higher cytokine levels appear more sensitive to BETi. Clinical studies have demonstrated beneficial effects of in vivo apabetalone treatment in reducing elevated plasma cytokine levels (e.g., TNF\u03b1 and IL-6) in patients with renal dysfunction. 37 Thus, apabetalone may be particularly effective at reducing hyper-inflammation in FD patients with renal disease.",
