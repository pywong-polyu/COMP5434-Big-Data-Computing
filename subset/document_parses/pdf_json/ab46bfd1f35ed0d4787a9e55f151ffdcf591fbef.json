Based on Lacanian psychoanalysis theory, this study analyzes the decision-making mechanism of the willingness of rural populations settling in cities (RPSC), and analyzes the key factors that affect the willingness of RPSC by using the binary Logit regression method based on survey data in Changyi, China. The results show that the willingness of RPSC is a realistic choice under the joint action of the 'mirrored' incarnation and the 'non-mirrored' order. Among the factors, 'age', 'ethnic groups', 'educational attainment', and 'social intercourse', representing the 'mirrored' incarnation, and 'communities' safety gap', 'healthcare services policy', 'public housing policy' and 'employment insurance gap', representing the 'non-mirrored' order, are significant in affecting the willingness of RPSC. These findings validate the adaptability of psychoanalysis to analyze the willingness of RPSC, and increases the understanding of individual willingness and behavioral choice in the context of a specific social background, which can provide decision-making reference for urban and rural planning and public policy makers.

However, the urbanization rate calculated by the urban registered population is only 43.37% [7]. The rural population makes a living in the city without urban household registration and is unable to receive treatment equal to the urban registered population. The rural population flows between cities and the countryside and even moves from one city to another to seek new employment opportunities. The phenomenon of rural population floating in cities is the embodiment of the low-cost urban development mode. Rural populations without urban household registration often encounter discrimination in employment, a lack of social welfare, and inability to participate in urban affairs and have no sense of belonging in cities [12] . The rural population often falls into the dilemma of 'staying in the city' or 'going home'. Because this development mode is not conducive to the long-term development of urbanization, a new type of urbanization emerged that proposes the development of a 'people-oriented' concept. The new type of urbanization focuses on encouraging rural populations to settle in cities so that they can achieve a better life. China's urbanization rate is still lower than that of the United Kingdom, Japan and other countries with similar population densities. The environmental capacity of existing cities has not yet reached its maximum, and the focus of urbanization strategy is still on increasing the urbanization rate by further promoting 'citizenization' based on RPSC [13] [14] [15] . The new type of urbanization encourages the development of small and medium-sized cities and optimizes the spatial distribution of cities by encouraging rural populations to settle in small and medium-sized cities. Especially in the face of the COVID-19 outbreak this year, it is time to profoundly rethink the low-cost urbanization development path, encourage the development of small and medium-sized cities and optimizes the spatial distribution of cities by encouraging rural populations to settle in small and medium-sized cities.",

For example, population geography proposes the 'push-pull' theory, which holds that population migration is the result of the joint action of the push forces of emigration and the pull forces of immigration [16] . From the perspective of the behavior decision-making process of individual migrants, the 'push-pull' theory includes two basic hypotheses: one assumes that people's migration behavior is a rational choice, while the other suggests that migrants have a relatively full understanding of information on the original residence and the destination. Only in this way can sound migration choices be made.",

They believe that regional differences in the demand and supply of labor cause the adjustment of labor between different regions, and rural-urban population migration is the embodiment of this adjustment process. The American development economist Todaro [17], starting from the urban labor market, believes that the willingness of RPSC could be explained by the 'expected returns'. Because cities provide more employment opportunities and higher incomes, large rural populations migrate to cities and towns. The theoretical premise of these studies is the assumption that the research object is the 'rational man' and that the migrating population will provide ideal feedback on policy regulation.",

            "text": "Population migration is an important phenomenon in the development of human society, especially in developing countries. The migration of populations is closely linked to the transformation of the economic and social structure in these countries, which is mainly reflected in rural-to-urban population migration driven by the promotion of urbanization, that is, rural populations settling in cities (RPSC) [1] [2] [3] [4] . In China, which is one of the most populous countries in the world, the phenomenon of RPSC is particularly typical. Household registration ('hukou') is used to divide the population of China into two categories: rural and urban households. The RPSC refers to the permanent settlement of the rural population in cities, including the full integration of the rural population into the urban economic and sociocultural environment, also known as 'citizenization' [5, 6] . From the optimal choice and decision-making environment. There is a trend toward using the 'behavioral man' to replace the 'rational man' in economics, focusing on the influence of social motivation on individual decision-making [18] . Simon [19, 20] demonstrates that the individual psychological process is the factor that restricts rational maximum decision-making, and Kahneman and Tversky [21] propose the prospect theory for decision-making behavior in uncertain situations, which started research on the influence of various behaviors and the factors that affect behavior in individual decision-making. Psychology has received considerable attention due to its exploration of individual decision-making mechanisms [22] . It is used to test the effect of policy related to individual decision-making behavior in practice and provides a useful reference for similar research and policy practice [23] . RPSC is a complex social system project that represents the transformation of the rural population in terms of social identity, occupation, role consciousness, ideology and social rights and reflects the city's acceptance of the rural population. There are abundant researches in the field of rural population's willingness to settle in the city, mainly focusing on the extraction of the dominant factors influencing the willingness, like economic, social, cultural, psychological and other fields [24] [25] [26] [27] . These studies show the diversity and hierarchy of factors affecting RPSC. However, they focus primarily on the expression of the correlation between the influencing factors and RPSC willingness based on the enumeration method, and the mechanism of the internal relations among the factors is not clear. Previous studies pay less attention to the factors that generate the willingness of RPSC with regard to the behavior decision-making process, and less focus on the migration and settlement of rural populations in small and medium-sized cities.",

Interpreting the objective world from the spiritual level has been a feasible way of solving practical problems. Since industrialization, psychology has developed as an independent discipline. Lacanian psychoanalytic theory, as one of the branches of post-Freudian psychoanalytic theory, has opened up the post-structural ideological system of psychoanalysis. Lacanian psychoanalysis re-explains the 'subject', 'unconscious', 'other', 'desire', and other core psychological concepts. The 'subject' is 'unconscious', usually reduced to subjection. The 'unconscious' is the discourse of the 'Other', which is inserted into the symbolic order like a language structure from the outside and operates according to different relations in the symbolic order.",

The subject's desire is the desire of the Other, which is not the actual object of desire but rather the object cause of desire [29] . In this sense, the Other is an expectation. Johnston [30] states that Lacanian psychoanalytic theory symbolizes desire as 'mirrored' (i.e., incarnated in visible avatars) and 'non-mirrored' (i.e., incapable of being captured in spatiotemporal representations). Especially for people in a certain process of social development, the formation of consciousness and the occurrence of behavior are at the same time. In the group, the unconscious behavior of all members has little difference, that is, the unconscious behavior has consistency. The 'mirrored' is therefore not a real other person but an imagination of oneself, an object that one desires to be; the 'non-mirrored' is a symbolic order, including laws and regulations. The 'mirrored' incarnation and the 'non-mirrored' order constitute the desire logic by which the Other regulates unconscious subjects.",
