            "text": "\u03b2-Arrestin1 is a multifunctional scaffold protein with the ability to interact with diverse signaling molecules independent of G protein-coupled receptors. We previously reported that overexpression of \u03b2-arrestin1 in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) decreased blood pressure (BP) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs). Nitric oxide (NO) is widely reported to be involved in central cardiovascular regulation. The goal of this study was to investigate whether NO signaling contributes to the \u03b2-arrestin1-mediated antihypertensive effect in the RVLM. It was found that bilateral injection of adeno-associated virus containing Arrb1 gene (AAV-Arrb1) into the RVLM of SHRs significantly increased NO production and NO synthase (NOS) activity. Microinjection of the non-selective NOS inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME; 10 nmol) into the RVLM prevented the \u03b2-arrestin1-induced cardiovascular inhibitory effect. Furthermore, \u03b2-arrestin1 overexpression in the RVLM significantly upregulated the expression of phosphorylated neuronal NOS (nNOS) by 3.8-fold and extracellular regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) by 5.6-fold in SHRs. The \u03b2-arrestin1-induced decrease in BP and RSNA was significantly abolished by treatment with ERK1/2 small interfering RNA (ERK1/2 siRNA). Moreover, ERK1/2 siRNA attenuated the \u03b2-arrestin1-induced NO production, NOS activity, and nNOS phosphorylation in the RVLM. Taken together, these data demonstrate that the antihypertensive effect of \u03b2-arrestin1 in the RVLM is mediated by nNOS-derived NO release, which is associated with ERK1/2 activation.",

Increasing evidence has proved \u03b2-arrestin1's versatile protective roles in cardiovascular diseases including cardiac injury and cerebral ischemia by regulating certain cellular signaling pathways (Tang et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2017) . Recently, \u03b2-arrestin signaling has been proved to be protective for lessening the tissue damage in the heart in the context of COVID-19 infection (Manglik et al., 2020) , and \u03b2-arrestin1 has been considered as an essential protective effector in pulmonary arterial hypertension by activating Akt/mTOR signaling (Ning et al., 2020) . In the central nervous system, \u03b2-arrestin1 signaling has been found to be involved in the processes of microglia dynamics regulation and maintaining hippocampal neurogenesis (Tao et al., 2015; Li et al., 2016) . Our previous study has demonstrated the protective effect of \u03b2-arrestin1 on cardiovascular activity in the rostral ventrolateral medulla (RVLM) of hypertensive rats. It is well known that the RVLM containing the pre-sympathetic neurons plays a key role in maintaining sympathetic vasomotor tone and blood pressure (BP) (Huber and Schreihofer, 2016) . However, the antihypertensive mechanism of \u03b2-arrestin1 in the RVLM needs to be further determined.",

            "text": "Nitric oxide (NO), synthesized by NO synthases (NOS) family, underlies the vasodilation of blood vessels and central functions as an important neurotransmitter in the brain (Chan and Chan, 2014) . One typical brain region where NO may be of primary importance in central cardiovascular regulation is the RVLM (Mayorov, 2005) , in which NO deficiency aggravates the impaired sympathetic baroreflex and increased sympathetic outflow in the state of hypertension or heart failure (Kishi et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2003) . Previous studies have shown that augmentation of NO derived from neuronal NOS (nNOS) in the RVLM is able to blunt sympathetic overactivity in heart failure rats Gao et al., 2008) . In additional, the nNOS/NO signaling is also believed to mediate sympathoinhibitory effects induced by a range of stimulations including angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 overexpression, angiotensin II (Ang II) type 1 receptor blockers, and exercise training (Wang et al., 2007; Zheng et al., 2011; Sousa et al., 2015) . Interestingly, it is suggested that there is a possible relationship between \u03b2-arrestin and NO signaling. For example, a novel role of \u03b2-arrestin1 has been demonstrated positively in the regulation of eNOS phosphorylation, making it useful for treating pulmonary hypertension and other vascular diseases (Carneiro et al., 2017; Ma et al., 2019) . However, it still remains elusive what roles \u03b2-arrestin1 plays in nNOS regulation in the RVLM. Hence, the present study was aimed to investigate the responses of nNOS/NO to \u03b2-arrestin1 stimulation in the RVLM in hypertension.",

The current results suggest that NO signaling plays an important role in mediating the inhibitory effect on sympathetic tone and BP evoked by \u03b2-arrestin1 in the RVLM, which is associated with activation of ERK1/2 signaling pathway. We have previously demonstrated a significant reduction in BP of SHRs 14 days after administration of AAV-Arrb1 into the RVLM (Sun et al., 2018) . In this previous study, we have confirmed the accuracy and efficacy of \u03b2-arrestin1 overexpression in the RVLM by immunofluorescence and Western blotting. In the present study, we totally used the same animal models and experimental protocols. Although we did not further test the efficacy of \u03b2-arrestin1 overexpression in the RVLM, we also confirmed an inhibitory effect of \u03b2-arrestin1 overexpression in the RVLM on BP and RSNA in the anesthetized SHRs. Interestingly, a recent research has proved that RVLM overexpression of \u03b2-arrestin2, a homologous subtype with \u03b2-arrestin1, also ameliorated hypertension by enhancing the cannabinoid type 1 (CB1) receptor desensitization . Therefore, it is suggested that both \u03b2-arrestin1 and \u03b2-arrestin2 are involved in the central regulation of BP in the RVLM. In addition, we have detected a similar decrease of \u03b2-arrestin1 expression in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS), rather than the cortex. As PVN and NTS are two important central sites involved in cardiovascular regulation, it motivates us to further determine the effects of \u03b2-arrestin1 on cardiovascular activities in these two regions.",

            "text": "Nitric oxide is well characterized for its vasodilatory role in cardiovascular regulation; and a number of studies have linked NO to cardiovascular activity in the RVLM (Machado et al., 2016; Lo et al., 2018) . However, the complicated responses and potential mechanisms are not well established yet. It is important to note that NO in the RVLM may dose-dependently be able to elicit sympathoexcitation and sympathoinhibition Huang et al., 2003 Huang et al., , 2004 . NO has been shown to reduce the release and formation of Ang II in the RVLM (Tagawa et al., 1999) , and damage of this inhibitory effect of NO on Ang II may cause the neurogenic pathophysiological of hypertension (Zanzinger, 2002) . Thus, considering that high concentration of Ang II in the RVLM contributes to sympathoexcitation and hypertension (Zhou et al., 2019) , it is possible that maintaining of NO production in the RVLM is beneficial for cardiovascular dysfunction. \u03b2-Arrestins have been demonstrated to be involved in the regulation of sympathetic activity and BP in the RVLM Sun et al., 2018) . Moreover, it has been demonstrated that \u03b2-arrestin1 is critical for NO production in human vascular endothelia cells (Carneiro et al., 2017) . However, the crosstalk between \u03b2-arrestin1 and NO in the RVLM has not been known yet. In the present study, we proved an important role of \u03b2-arrestin1 in evoking NO release in the RVLM of SHRs, which extended our knowledge of \u03b2-arrestin1's effect on BP regulation under pathological conditions. Nitric oxide production is regulated by NOS catalysis; and the three isoforms, nNOS, eNOS, and iNOS, are located in the RVLM (Chang et al., 2003) . Although there are a variety of roles of NO from different NOS isoforms in the RVLM in cardiovascular regulation, nNOS is judged to be more prevalent in the regulation of basal sympathetic outflow and vasomotor tone (Chan et al., 2001) . Moreover, neuroprotective effects of nNOS activation in the RVLM in response to upstream stimulation like resveratrol and heat shock protein 60 have been reported (Chan et al., 2007a; Cheng et al., 2016) . Nevertheless, there is no consensus on the specific role of nNOS in facilitating or blocking cardiovascular dysfunction under pathological conditions. Importantly, in the current study, we found that overexpression of \u03b2-arrestin1 in the RVLM significantly increased nNOS phosphorylation. As upregulation of iNOS in the RVLM had long been accepted to cause sympathetic activation and hypertension (Kimura et al., 2005) , it may be a limitation that the effects of \u03b2-arrestin1 on iNOS were not detected in this work. Based on our current data, it is implied that nNOS serves as the prioritized source of NO in response to the \u03b2-arrestin1-mediated sympathoinhibitory effect in the RVLM of hypertension.",

Carneiro et al., 2017) . It is reported that ERK1/2, a widely appreciated signaling molecule, mediates \u03b2-arrestin1-dependent signaling transduction (Shenoy et al., 2006) . Moreover, ERK1/2 is reported to be critical for the regulation of BP in the brain stem (Ibrahim and Abdel-Rahman, 2012) . The present study demonstrated that overexpression of \u03b2-arrestin1 significantly promoted ERK1/2 phosphorylation. As ERK1/2 activation in the RVLM could lead to sympathoinhibition or sympathoexcitation (Chan et al., 2005; Cheng et al., 2016) , it was essential to define the role of ERK1/2 elevation by \u03b2-arrestin1 in control of the final BP response. It is noteworthy that ERK1/2 underlies contradictory responses elicited by upstream stimulators such as Ang II or \u03b1 2A adrenergic agonist (Chan et al., 2007b; Nassar and Abdel-Rahman, 2008 ). In the present study, we inhibited ERK1/2 using a specific ERK1/2 siRNA injection into the RVLM of SHRs. As a result, ERK1/2 inhibition abrogated the suppressor effect caused by \u03b2-arrestin1 in the RVLM, indicating that \u03b2-arrestin1 is tightly linked to ERK1/2 activation in the light of cardiovascular response. Moreover, no changes in BP and RSNA were observed in the deficiency of ERK1/2 in the RVLM free of \u03b2-arrestin1 overexpression. Collectively, our findings suggest that \u03b2-arrestin1-induced ERK1/2 activation certainly contributes to cardiovascular response. A previous study has demonstrated that overexpression of \u03b2-arrestin1 facilitates and solidifies ERK1/2 activation in the cytoplasmic pool but inhibits ERK1/2-dependent transcription in the nucleus (Tohgo et al., 2002) . Consistent with this observation, our data found that in the presence of overexpressed \u03b2-arrestin1, the cytosolic phosphorylation degree of ERK1/2 was totally enhanced. However, difference in nuclear translocation of phosphorylated ERK1/2 by \u03b2-arrestin1 remains to be illustrated. The involvement of ERK1/2 phosphorylation in nNOS activation in a fructoseinduced model of hypertension (Cheng et al., 2016) presents feasibility for investigating ERK1/2-nNOS pathway in the current study. Consistent with this hypothesis, our results have proved that the \u03b2-arrestin1-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation was responsible for nNOS activation and NO release in the RVLM. Interestingly, ERK1/2 silencing alone presented no effect on NO production or nNOS phosphorylation in the RVLM of SHRs. Previous evidence has shown that ERK1/2 activation triggered ribosomal S6 kinase (RSK) phosphorylation, which directly phosphorylates nNOS (Song et al., 2007) , indicating an indirect regulation of ERK1/2 on nNOS. These findings together predict a direct or indirect link between ERK1/2 and nNOS and suggest a pivotal role of \u03b2-arrestin1 in mediating this molecular communication in the RVLM. However, it is a pity that our results showed no changes in RSK expression by \u03b2-arrestin1 overexpression in the RVLM, suggesting that RSK signaling pathway may not be involved in \u03b2-arrestin1-induced activation of nNOS.",

We conclude that (1) an enhancement in NO release is an important cause of \u03b2-arrestin1induced protective response in the RVLM of hypertension, and (2) this effect is underpinned, at least partly, by ERK1/2-mediated nNOS activation. The present study highlights central \u03b2-arrestin1 as an important manager for cardiovascular regulation, impelling us to further explore other potential roles of neuromodulators for cardiovascular protection in hypertension.",
