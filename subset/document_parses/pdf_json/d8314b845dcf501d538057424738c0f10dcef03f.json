Individuals with less trust in information sources and more endorsement of CAM were more unwilling to take a COVID-19 vaccine. Distrust in information sources was the strongest and most consistent predictor in all models. Our analyses also revealed that some of the people who respond negatively to the NPIs also have a lower likelihood to take the vaccine. This association was partly related to a lower trust in information sources. Conclusions: Distrusting the establishment to provide accurate information, believing in conspiracy theories, and endorsing treatments and substances that are not part of conventional medicine, are all associated with a more negative response to the official guidelines during COVID-19. How people respond to the guidelines, however, is more strongly and consistently related to the degree of trust they feel in the information sources, than to their tendency to hold conspiracy beliefs or endorse CAM. These findings highlight the need for governments and health authorities to create communication strategies that build public trust.",

In the absence of any effective treatments or vaccines for the disease, governments worldwide implemented a wide range of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as social distancing, school closures, remote working, restrictions concerning public gatherings, quarantines, hand-washing and the use of masks to slow transmission of the disease [1] . Those measures (e.g., school closures and stay-at-home-orders) have been shown to be effective in reducing the number of infections [2, 3] , but that success has been accompanied by substantial economic, social [4] and psychological costs (for a review, see [5] ). To ease the burden on society, a great effort worldwide has been put into developing and getting access to a vaccine [6, 7] . A year after the first reported cases of COVID-19, countries around the world have started vaccinations [8] .",

When it comes to a vaccine against COVID-19, recent studies alarmingly show that although most people would take the vaccine, many individuals report that they feel hesitant towards it or would not get vaccinated [15, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] .

The present study focuses on the role of three factors: conspiracy beliefs, a distrust in the institutions providing health information, and an endorsement of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Conspiracy beliefs are known to be involved in nearly all forms of science denial (e.g., [24] ; for a summary, see [25, 26] ), and COVID-19 is no exception [27, 28] . Several studies have shown that conspiracy beliefs are a particularly strong predictor of the rejection of vaccinations [24, 29] , including the rejection of COVID-19 vaccines [30] . Conspiracy beliefs are also related to the other factors. Individuals with more conspiracy beliefs have lower trust in science or political and medical authorities [11, 15, 17, 18, 31, 32] and a higher likelihood to turn to CAM [17, 19, 31, 33] , possibly due to a distrust in the biomedical system [34] . People who endorse CAM have less trust in medical authorities [35] .",

Holding conspiracy beliefs typically implies believing that a secretive group of people with malicious intentions are behind a particular event [40] . Conspiracy beliefs are common during public health crises and may influence people not to take preventive actions [41] . The COVID-19 pandemic provides a fertile breeding ground for conspiracy theories, because it is a complex event that causes fear and is difficult to understand [42] . Indeed, studies show that conspiracy theories about COVID-19 are common [11, 15, 27] and relate, for example, to the origin and spread of the virus, the reasons behind the NPIs or the development of a vaccine [43, 44] . Alarmingly, individuals who believe in COVID-19 conspiracy theories are more likely to have negative attitudes to a government's response to the pandemic [31, 36] , not adhere to NPIs, such as handwashing or social distancing [11, 14-19, 27, 31, 37] and reject a future vaccination against COVID-19 [15, 18, 19, 30, 33, 37, 38] . These results are in line with previous studies investigating the relationship between conspiracy beliefs and negative attitudes to other vaccines [24, 45, 46] . However, not all studies find an effect between conspiracy beliefs and people's compliance with the official guidelines during COVID-19 [13, 47] .",

This uncertainty and constantly evolving science on COVID-19, has made health communication during the pandemic difficult [49] , as it has resulted not only in a massive flow of health information, but also in rapidly changing information, mixed messages and inconsistencies in recommendations. The possible consequences of this on the public's trust in health communicators and policy makers is a matter of concern [48] because low trust has been related to a smaller likelihood of following recommendations given by health authorities during previous outbreaks of infectious diseases [50, 51] . The importance of trust has also been emphasized in studies on COVID-19, as stronger public trust has been related to lower COVID-19 mortality [52] , a greater reduction in human mobility during lockdown [53] , a higher likelihood of individuals complying with the NPIs [10, 17, 18] , and more willingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine [18, 22] . A lack of trust in medical authorities is an important antecedent of antivaccination attitudes [35, [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] and antivaccination behavior [35] also when it comes to other vaccines.",

By definition, CAM can be used either in addition to, or instead of, conventional treatments [59] . Approximately 30% of adults living in the U.S. [60] and 10-40% in Europe [61] use CAM. Studies show that individuals who use CAM, or have positive attitudes to CAM, have a lower likelihood of complying with conventional treatments, such as vaccinations [35, [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . It has been suggested that the relationship between positive attitudes to CAM and negative attitudes to vaccines is due to an underlying view on health that is not evidence-based and an unwillingness to adhere to conventional medicine [62] [63] [64] . Among those who endorse CAM, CAM is also considered a natural, non-toxic way to strengthen the immune system, while vaccines are perceived as harmful [63] . Furthermore, both CAM use and antivaccination attitudes have been shown to be related to lower trust in medical authorities [35] . As regards COVID-19, recent studies suggest that people with more positive attitudes to CAM are more unwilling to accept a COVID-19 vaccine [33] and to follow the official COVID-19 guidelines [17] .",

We also tested the hypotheses that COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, a lack of trust in information sources and more positive attitudes to CAM are related to an unwillingness to take a vaccine against COVID-19. Finally, we explored whether people's responses to the NPIs are related to their willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine, and whether this association can be explained by conspiracy beliefs, a lower trust in the information sources, and more endorsement of CAM.",

Compliance with NPIs during COVID-19, emotional response to NPIs during COVID-19, COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs, trust in COVID-19 information sources, and CAM endorsement, were represented by latent factors. We specified an SR model with three outcome measures: NPI compliance, NPI emotional response, and vaccination intentions. The outcomes were regressed on the factors Conspiracy beliefs, Trust, and CAM endorsement. Then we investigated whether Conspiracy beliefs, Trust, and CAM endorsement explained the possible associations between people's response to the NPIs (NPI compliance and NPI emotional response) and their vaccination intentions. This was done by exploring whether the disturbance correlations (i.e., the correlations between the proportion of the variances that are not explained by the predictors) between the outcome measures were weaker than their zero-order correlations. We applied WLSMV estimation due to ordinal indicators and skewed distributions. We applied pairwise deletion of missing values.",

Additionally, some individuals are unwilling to take a vaccine against COVID-19 [15, [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . The results from the present study conducted during the first peak of COVID-19, support those findings. They show that on average, 93% of the respondents had been completely or somewhat willing (78 and 15% respectively) to comply with the NPIs implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic, and on average, 10% felt frustrated, annoyed, or upset because of the NPIs. Furthermore, 73% considered it very or somewhat likely (51 and 22% respectively) that they would take a vaccine against COVID-19, if the authorities recommended it and if it were free of charge. These percentages roughly correspond to the results from previous studies conducted in other countries [15, 18, 20, 22] .",

Trust in the sources providing information on COVID-19 was the strongest predictor of all three outcomes, explaining approximately 12-14% of the variance in people's response to the NPIs and 20% in people's willingness to take the vaccine. Of the four listed sources of information (i.e., medical doctors, scientists, news media, authorities), only approximately half of the respondents completely or somewhat trusted the authorities and the media in providing accurate information on COVID-19.

However, the hypothesis that people who have stronger COVID-19 conspiracy beliefs are less willing to take a vaccine against COVID-19 [15, 18, 19, 33, 37, 38] , was not supported. The zero-order correlation between conspiracy beliefs and COVID-19 vaccination intentions was medium strong (r = \u2212.45), indicating that more conspiracy beliefs are related to more unwillingness to take a COVID-19 vaccine. When controlling for the other predictors in the model, however, the unique effect of conspiracy beliefs did not reach statistical significance. On average 8% believed that the Fig. 2 Standardized estimates, correlations between predictors, and disturbance correlations between outcomes. Factor indicators, loadings, and variances are not shown in the figure conspiracy theories are completely or somewhat true (3 and 5%, respectively). Of the four listed conspiracy theories, beliefs that a hidden organization or financial interests lie behind the spread of COVID-19, received the most support. The average proportion of people whoto some degree -believe in the conspiracy theories, is lower than in previous studies. For example, in two studies investigating COVID-19 related conspiracy beliefs in the UK [15, 27] , the average percentage of people believing in the COVID-19 related conspiracy theories was almost twice as high as in the present study. One possible reason for this discrepancy relates to which conspiracy beliefs were included in the questionnaires. However, for the same conspiracy theories, endorsement was also higher in the two studies conducted in the UK [15, 27] . For example, the statement that the COVID-19 pandemic was a hoax was supported by approximately 7% in the Allington et al.

The correlations between endorsement of CAM and the two outcomes measuring people's response to the NPIs were statistically significant and moderate, indicating that more endorsement of CAM was related to a more negative response to the NPIs. There was, however no statistically significant unique effect of CAM endorsement when controlling for the other predictors in the model. Similar findings were reported in the previous study investigating the role of conspiracy beliefs, trust, and CAM beliefs in people's compliance with NPIs [17] . That study demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between CAM beliefs and NPI compliance, but no mediating effect of CAM beliefs when studying the effects of conspiracy beliefs on NPI compliance. Of the participants in the present study, approximately 47% completely or somewhat endorsed CAM (26 and 21%, respectively). These numbers are higher than in the previous study [67] where the same set of statements were used to measure CAM attitudes in the UK. In that study, approximately 35% had positive attitudes to CAM to some degree.",

People with lower trust in the establishment giving accurate information had stronger conspiracy beliefs, and a more positive attitude to CAM.

A key factor in building trust during a pandemic is transparent communication [48, 71] . Correcting conspiracy theories is challenging, particularly among strong believers of conspiracy theories [72] . One explanation is that evidence against a theory may be interpreted as evidence supporting the theory, because the people who are providing the evidence are seen as part of the conspiracy [73] . However, some suggestions on how to tackle conspiracy theories do exist, such as providing anti-conspiracy (i.e., accurate scientific information) information prior to the conspiracy theories becoming established [74] , or approaching the issue by treating the possible underlying motives, such as feelings of powerlessness [42, 72] , distrust, and alienation [42] .",

Important to note, however, is that the gender distribution in the present study was very uneven, with men constituting only 1/5 of the total sample.
