To address the challenges described and to achieve universal health coverage (UHC) by 2030, countries need to develop effective HRH leaderships relevant to the complexity of HLM in the most diverse contexts, including acute surge events during PHE. In complex and rapidly changing contexts, such as PHE, leadership needs to be attentive, nimble, adaptive, action oriented, transformative, accountable and provided throughout the system, i.e., authentic, distributed and participatory. This type of leadership is particularly important, as it can contribute to complex organizational changes as required in surge events associated with PHE, even in in the absence of formal management plans, roles, and structures. To deal with the uncertainty it needs agile tools that may allow prompt human resources impact assessments.",

Hence, leaders need skills, mindsets, capabilities and tools that go beyond the usual dimensions of HRH policy and management. These tools, namely human resources impact assessment (HRIA), have been suggested in past publications [20] . Based on the HLM framework and good practice principles from other fields, a draft HRIA tool has been proposed but still needs finalization and validation before it is adopted. Once adopted, it may require further conceptual evolution to accommodate multiple uncertainties [17] and methodological developments to be fully operational and readily applicable to PHE [21] .",
