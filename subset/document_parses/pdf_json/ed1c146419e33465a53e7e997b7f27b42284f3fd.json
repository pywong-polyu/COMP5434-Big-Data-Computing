Evidence suggests application of co-design in various health domains has been growing; however, few public-facing digital interventions have been co-designed to specifically address the needs of adults at risk of Type 2 diabetes (T2D). This study aims to: (1) co-design, with key stakeholders, a digital dietary intervention to promote health behaviour change among adults at risk of T2D, and (2) evaluate the co-design process involved in developing the intervention prototype. Methods: The co-design study was based on a partnership between nutrition researchers and designers experienced in co-design for health. Potential end-users (patients and health professionals) were recruited from an earlier stage of the study. Three online workshops were conducted to develop and review prototypes of an app for people at risk of T2D. Themes were inductively defined and aligned with persuasive design (PD) principles used to inform ideal app features and characteristics.",

Participants expressed the need for information from credible sources and to provide effective strategies to overcome social and environmental influences on eating behaviours. Preferred app features included tailoring to the individual's unique characteristics, ability to track and monitor dietary behaviour, and tools to facilitate controlled social connectivity. Relevant persuasive design principles included social support, reduction (reducing effort needed to reach target behaviour), tunnelling (guiding users through a process that leads to target behaviour), praise, rewards, and self-monitoring. The most preferred prototype was the Choices concept, which focusses on the users' journey of health behaviour change and recognises progress, successes, and failures in a supportive and encouraging manner. The workshops were rated successful, and feedback was positive. Conclusions: The study's co-design methods were successful in developing a functionally appealing and relevant digital health promotion intervention. Continuous engagement with stakeholders such as designers and end-users is needed to further develop a working prototype for testing.",

            "text": "Co-design is a participatory approach to designing products or solutions that often leads to sustainable usage [13] , offering potential design and development application for translational digital health tools targeting chronic disease including T2D. Co-design considers users' needs, desires, characteristics and abilities throughout the design process [13] , that in this case address the central role of individual behaviour in chronic disease management [14] . In research contexts, co-design is grounded in participatory action research (PAR) principles, a \"bottom-up\" approach recognised to have significant advantages in translational health research. A key characteristic of PAR is involvement of researchers collaborating with end-users and key stakeholders in the process of research, policy and program development to produce outputs highly relevant to community needs [15] . When used in a healthcare setting, co-design has the potential to integrate end-user and healthcare worker experiences' (as well as other stakeholders), to collaboratively explore solutions to local problems [16] . Making, or thinking while doing is considered to be key within co-design practice and occurs through three approaches: probes (materials used to evoke users' experiences and behaviours that inspire design), generative toolkits (used to produce artefacts and depictions of their use which are then analysed to identify patterns), and prototypes (tangible manifestations of ideas or concepts) [17] . The act of making is creative, processes based and involves both construction and the transformation of meaning from these activities [17] . The making process can also be described as a divergent process, with a focus on increasing knowledge and the generation of new ideas [18] . This is often paired with convergent processes of coanalysis where stakeholders collaboratively work through the generated information to identify and prioritise key elements [18] . Co-design processes are varied and are adapted to suit the needs of the participants, but typically involve iterative or multiple stages of engagement.",

The focus of predesign is the broader context of experience, whereas post-design studies people's actual experience of the product, service, or space [17] . The generative phase (stage 2) guides decision-making to identify design opportunities, and the evaluative phase covers the iterative design process whereby prototypes are tested and refined with stakeholders [17] . In the British Design Council's Double Diamond Design Process model, there are also four phases which blend divergent and convergent approaches: discover, define, develop, and deliver [18] . The discover phase aligns with Sanders & Stappers' [17] pre-design phase, while the define phase is a specific process of revisiting and prioritising the main challenges that have been uncovered and that should be taken forward into the generative develop phase [18] . The generative, evaluative, and post-design stages of Sanders & Stappers' model roughly align with the develop and deliver phases of the Double Diamond as a cyclical and iterative process based on prototype development, testing and iteration [17, 18] .",

Other examples have targeted specific populations, including older adults with age-related macular degeneration [21] and Indigenous communities [22] . Whilst these are promising examples, further research is needed to demonstrate how co-design can be conducted and reported in a rigorous manner and its value realised for different health applications. To our knowledge, there are currently no public facing digital interventions, for example smartphone-based apps, which have been co-designed to specifically address the needs of adults at risk of T2D [23] .",

            "text": "Workshop 1 Discover: In this workshop the findings from the Delphi study were used to guide the development of two main activities. The first activity extended the findings from the Delphi study by using a collaging exercise to translate abstract concepts such as \"simple and easy to understand\" into practical examples. This process allowed the team to uncover features of information that the potential end-users present in the workshop found \"simple and easy to understand\" as well as those that made information \"complex and hard to understand\". The second activity focused on challenging the assumption that access to information, selfmonitoring, and online support and success stories would lead to behaviour change. This activity asked participants to explore their personal mobile phones and to self-evaluate the kinds of apps they had installed, as well as the frequency of their use. Upon sharing with their small groups, the importance of driving engagement rather than the passive provision of a service emerged as being of critical importance. Workshop 2 Define: This workshop focused on convergent analysis processes to identify key pieces of information that should be carried forward in the project. It used a co-analysis process to review the design researchers' interpretations of the findings from Workshop 1, checking assumptions and gaps to ensure the findings were representative of the end-users' contributions. The workshop then focused on identifying the specific kinds of information that users of a T2D app may find useful. An anonymous form of contribution was used to create a safe space for participants to respond to questions such as \"what are people too embarrassed to ask?\". The collated responses from this activity were then taken back into the collaborative workshop space to explore who this information should and should not be delivered by, and specifically which types of information people would feel comfortable receiving from an app or digital source. Following Workshop 2, the design academics developed four app concepts or prototypes ( Fig. 1 ) that were used in Workshop 3 for the purpose of soliciting feedback on potential app designs. Workshop 3 Develop: In the final co-design workshop of this part of the project, abstraction was reintroduced to encourage participants to think creatively and to identify new opportunities. The workshop began by presenting participants with abstract 'app icons' and asking them to collaboratively describe what features they represented and whether they should be included in a T2D app or not. These features were then carried forward into a Job Story template to explore how, when, where, and by whom the feature may be used, eliciting further creative reflection on how a T2D app may be used. The final part of this workshop presented the group with a series of mock-up prototypes of the app. Throughout the workshop series, process evaluation data was collected through team discussions and de-briefing sessions, as well as via online feedback surveys from participants.

Workshop 1 identified a high proportion of the apps that participants frequently used in general were social media apps or apps facilitating interaction and communication. This can be attributed to the social influences domain under the TDF. Apps that had large user bases, make life easier to manage (e.g. email, online shopping), exercise or fitness tracking apps, and apps with short form content such as news or education were also popular. The second theme, information and education, informs how the information provided through the app should be framed. We first inquired about information that is unappealing or frustrating to participants, which including information that is complex and hard to understand, for which there is 'no right answer' (abstract) or uses scientific or technical language. When discussing the complexity of language to be used in the app, one participant indicated \"If there is too much it is overloading [and] too conflicting\". An emergent theme in this workshop was a significant volume of discussion about seemingly contradictory information, and a perception that there should be a \"right answer\" or \"single truth\". Suggestions to overcome this complexity included to build information into manageable chunks, drawing the connections between different information, and connecting health or medical facts with the everyday experience are important principles for designing appbased education content.

Language style was considered of critical importance with positive language & framing (e.g., use 'within range' rather than 'good/bad') and the use of icons to reduce words perceived as important strategies for communicating health information. These are summarised in Tables 2 and 3, which shows specific findings from the workshop, their links to persuasive design principles, and how they may be implemented within an intervention.

For example, app alters media items such as sounds to reward user's performance; app gives users reward points for achieving individual goals. drinking only non-sweetened beverages every day, for example. Interestingly, the workshops uncovered several persuasive strategies which are less common in digital dietary apps [31] . These were tunnelling, liking, similarity, rewards, and competition. Inclusion and evaluation of these persuasive design elements in future digital health interventions warrant further investigation. Findings from the co-design workshops add support to those of the formative Delphi study [24] . For example, in the Delphi study, end-users identified financial strain as a barrier to healthy habits. This issue was raised in Workshop 3; when asked what should be included in a T2D app, a participant stated: \"Budget menu planner, with recipes, so if you're broke you can still eat for good T2 management \u2026\" . It should be noted that such strategies and indeed, digital health more broadly, is not expected to be able to help users overcome social determinants of health including poverty and access to healthy foods. Instead, their utility may be limited to providing behaviour change support for individuals who are ready and able to undertake it. Notwithstanding, congruence between the co-design and Delphi study findings strengthen the overall co-design project as frequently raised matters can be leveraged in the intervention design.",

The target sample size was not met (participant attendance met 36-60% of the workshop attendance target), which may have been due at least in part to the online delivery of the workshops, the necessity to coordinate common times and the relative ease of not attending. Furthermore, it was not possible to ensure a consistent of different health status, educational attainment, or other demographic characteristics across the three workshops because participants were able to attend as few or as many workshops as desired. This is consistent with previous research and recruiting representative research samples is an ongoing challenge in public health [33] . Consequently, the proportions of people with T2D or people with higher/ lower education varied between the workshops. This may have influenced the prioritisation and interventional features and characteristics identified that may potentially limited the generalisability of the findings. However, the replication of themes across multiple groups suggests the sample may have been large enough to establish a degree of saturation of perspectives. It was challenging to schedule a time which suited all interested participants; however, future co-design protocols researchers should attempt to avoid conducting workshops during late afternoon peak hours as per participant feedback. Health professionals were also underrepresented in the sample due to their lower proportion who attended the workshops. It is acknowledged that additional workshops may be needed to include participants in subsequent phases of the broader co-design project to increase generalisability of the findings and app. Nevertheless, a benefit of having fewer participants per workshop allowed for an increased depth of engagement with individual participants.",

It is acknowledged that this study has only examined the appeal of the digital intervention and thus conclusions about its efficacy in diabetes prevention cannot be made. Further work is needed to maintain a high level of engagement with end-users and stakeholders to develop final prototypes for real-world testing. Future research should also examine the use and effectiveness of co-design in developing digital dietary interventions in other relevant health domains. ",
