Gene ontology analysis revealed that up-regulated genes were enriched for immune-related pathways, whereas down-regulated genes were enriched for pathways related to heart function ( Figure 1K ). Simultaneously, the levels of myocarditis-related genes, including Ccl5 11 and Myh7, 12 are increased, whereas the expression of heart development-related genes, including Nrp2 13 and Rbp4, 14 was decreased in heart tissue as demonstrated by RNA sequencing ( Figure 1L ). We observed ZIKV infection and functional impairment in the hearts of foetal mice ( Figure 1B) and IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knockout mice adult mice ( Figure S1 ), but not in BALB/c WT adult mice hearts ( Figure   S1 ), which indicates that the hearts of immune-deficient and foetal mice are more susceptible to ZIKV infection. Therefore, it will be appropriate to elevate the titre of ZIKV to determine whether adult WT hearts would infect because another study had reported that people who were positive for ZIKV were diagnosed with myocarditis, arrhythmias and heart failure. 6 It will be desirable to investigate whether ZIKV infects BALB/c WT pregnant mice due to a greater burden on the existing physiological changes in organs during pregnancy. 15 Our results using the embryo injection mouse model show important implications for explaining maternal-infant outcome in women exposed to ZIKV during pregnancy. Thus, more attention should be paid to cardiovascular symptoms in clinical practice, and further studies to elucidate the mechanisms underlying cardiac dysfunctions associated with ZIKV infection are urgently needed.

A, Immunohistochemistry of heart tissue sections stained for ZIKV in the brain and heart of offspring at day 9 after birth. In the infected and uninfected groups, n = 3 and n = 8 mice were included, respectively. Representative results from one mouse are displayed. B, Immunostaining shows that ZIKV (green) is detectable in cardiomyocytes (\u03b1-actinin + , red) of ZIKV-infected mice 9 d after birth. C-F, Echocardiography revealed that ejection fraction and fractional shortening were decreased at days 4 and 9 after birth (C, D), and diastolic and systolic diameters increased at days 4 and 9 after birth (E, F). Mock (n = 5), ZIKV-infected (n = 3) and uninfected (n = 8) offspring, respectively. Each dot represents one mouse. *P < .05; **P < .01. G, H, ECLA shows that serum CK-MB and cTnT levels are elevated in ZIKV-infected mice at days 4 and 9 after birth. Mock (n = 5), ZIKV-infected (n = 3) and uninfected (n = 8) offspring, respectively. Each dot represents one mouse. *P < .05; **P < .01. I, J, Haematoxylin-eosin staining displays monocyte infiltration in the myocardium. Immunohistochemistry showed that the numbers of F4/80 + macrophages and CD3 + leucocytes were significantly increased in the myocardium of ZIKV-infected mice compared to uninfected mice at 9 d after birth. K, Gene ontology (GO) analysis of up-regulated (left) and down-regulated genes (right), respectively, based on RNA-Seq data. The top 10 GO terms are shown. L, Heat maps showing hierarchical clustering of enriched differentially expressed genes between ZIKVinfected and uninfected mouse hearts. Each lane represents the result from one mouse. n = 3 in each group",

These data indicate that ZIKV can directly infect cardiomyocytes, causing myocarditis and heart function impairment. Our findings support previous reports linking heart disease with in utero exposure to ZIKV and provide evidence for the high prevalence and pathogenesis of cardiac disease in neonatal mice. Exposure of 2-weeks pregnant BALB/c wild-type (WT) mice to ZIKV can cause both nervous system disorders and heart disorders in offspring. Even if embryos (n = 17) of six pregnant BALB/c mice were surgically delivered, only 11 offspring were viable, and we could not point the exact reason why the other six foetal mice died in utero, which may be related to ZIKV exposure.",
