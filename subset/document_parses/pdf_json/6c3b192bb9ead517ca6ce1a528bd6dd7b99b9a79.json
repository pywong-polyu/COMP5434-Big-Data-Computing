These individuals described a subjective worsening in symptoms assessed in the Ocular Surface Disease Index. Patients showed a deterioration in corneal staining, as well as a distinct increase in dryness reported by cataract patients on postoperative day 1. The majority of individuals described an awareness of air blowing upward from the mask into their eyes. This increased airflow likely accelerates the evaporation of the tear film which, when continuous for hours or days, may result in ocular surface irritation or inflammation. In addition to air convection, other factors are also likely at play. Staff members using taped masks to prevent air convection toward the eyes also complained of corneal irritation. In these cases, we postulate that the tape adhering to the skin of the upper cheek may interfere with the normal excursion of the lower eyelid, possibly inducing mechanical ectropion with secondary lagophthalmos.",

Exposure keratopathy has been documented as a result of lagophthalmos, ectropion, or mechanical ventilation [1, 2] . Devices that mechanically blow air around the face have also been found to affect the eye. One study showed an increase in dry eye symptoms with certain powered air-purifying respirators (PAPRs) [3] . Irritation and contact lens dryness were found in patients using chemical protection hoods that blow air across the inside of the face mask [4] . Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks may cause ocular surface irritation due to air leakage or regurgitation through the nasolacrimal system [5, 6] . All of these studies suggest that increased air convection affects the eye; however, this process is not described in the context of face mask use.",

The authors of another article briefly theorize that more frequent eye touching may increase virus transmission because of the uncomfortable feeling of air blowing from the face mask into the eyes [9] .",

This pathway may be further compromised by irritation from mask use. The tear film is an essential barrier against pathogenic invasion but may be compromised if mask use causes this barrier to evaporate more rapidly [10] . Discomfort from dry eyes may also increase eye rubbing and face touching behaviors, with attendant fomite transmission [9] . All of these factors together create an increased concern for ocular infections secondary to prolonged mask wear. This risk is particularly worrisome during the current pandemic due to a well-documented probability of the novel coronavirus spreading through contact with the eye [8, 10, 11] .",
