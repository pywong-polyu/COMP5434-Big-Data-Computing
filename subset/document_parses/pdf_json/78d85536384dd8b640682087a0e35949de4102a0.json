However, linking and retention remain a serious challenge for ART programs in SSA. 8 Through formative research, we identified a strong desire among men living with HIV for peer support.",

Such high uptake was surprising, given the well-documented barriers to men testing and linking to HIV care in SSA. 13, 14 In South Africa, for example, compared with women, men have 4 times higher odds of not being tested for HIV; and men living with HIV have nearly twice the odds of not knowing their HIV status compared with women. 15 Consequently, men generally initiate ART when they are older and sicker than women, 16 resulting in higher morbidity and mortality. 17 In recent years, there is growing awareness of the critical need for effective strategies to increase HIV testing and earlier linkage to care for men in SSA. 18 Some successes have been reported in community-based compared with facility-based HIV testing and ART initiation. [19] [20] [21] However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has severely reduced HIV testing and ART initiation in many countries. For example, South Africa reported a 47.6% and 46% decrease in HIV testing and ART initiation, respectively, in April 2020, the first month of lockdown. 22 Despite this, we found high uptake not only at the community level, reaching men generally regarded as hard to reach, but also in health care facility settings. Newly diagnosed as well as previously diagnosed men were keen to participate in this peer support-based model.",

            "text": "Short-term retention (with no treatment interruptions) was high in both groups, ranging from (Table 2) . Overall, 618 (16%) participants had at least 1 treatment interruption, with newly diagnosed and previously diagnosed men accounting for 12% (n=168) and 18% (n=450) respectively. Overall, 28 men (0.7%) transferred out and 10 men (0.3%) died. Short-term retention on ART is critical, given the elevated risk of morbidity and mortality within the first few months on treatment and after treatment interruption. 23 Studies have confirmed poorer retention in HIV care among men than women at each stage of the HIV care continuum in SSA. [24] [25] [26] [27] Our pilot increased early retention by 620% compared with background rates for these districts, 28 providing promising preliminary results that merit further investigation. For example, quarterly cohorts' retention rates were 66.5% and 66.2%, in Ugu District and KwaZulu-Natal province, respectively. 28 In Ehlanzeni District, Mpumalanga province, the retention rates were 64% and 69%, respectively, in quarters 1 and 2 of FY2020. Low rates of retention in care have also been reported in other studies conducted in similar settings. 24, 27 Outcomes After Treatment Interruption in the Coach Mpilo Pilot Project Among the 618 participants who experienced at least 1 treatment interruption while enrolled in Coach Mpilo, we excluded 55 (9%) who interrupted treatment in September and lacked follow-up time to assess subsequent outcomes. Among the remaining 563 participants, the majority (82%, n=464) returned to HIV treatment during the pilot period, ranging from 78% (n=118) of newly diagnosed to 84% (n=346) of previously diagnosed men (Figure) . As of September 2020, 95% (n=3,653) of all participants reported being active on HIV treatment, including those retained consistently as well as those who had experienced a treatment interruption but returned to care within the pilot period.",

Coaches can be recruited locally in any community where men are living with HIV who are stable on treatment. They can be trained within 1 week, and the training does not rely on any prior knowledge or education. Coaches are compensated at a similar level as other entry-level public health cadres, for example, lay counselors and community health workers. Being community-based, the coaches do not require major infrastructural or operational support from the clinics. Clinic teams and implementing partners found the model feasible and acceptable. Since the pilot was conducted, 7 U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief partners in South Africa have integrated the model into their large-scale treatment programs.",

However, changes in data access policies to protect patient privacy enacted shortly after the pilot's launch prevented any linkage to TIER.Net. Thus, we relied on self-report, and our results may reflect social desirability bias and overestimate true retention. Future studies should include validation of participants' treatment status, preferably with measured viral suppression as a proxy for adherence. The project also experienced major disruptions due to COVID-19, including restrictions on physical movement, multimonth dispensing, changes in operating hours, designation of some clinics as COVID-19-only, and general fear of visiting health facilities. In the next phase, we will assess impact, scalability, and cost-effectiveness more robustly, using lessons learned from the pilot.",
