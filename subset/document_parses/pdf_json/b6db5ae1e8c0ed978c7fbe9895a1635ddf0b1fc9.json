            "text": "Frequent testing is critical to limit SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In response to this need, we developed SalivaDirect, a sensitive, simplified, and flexible testing framework, which received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). We tested saliva collected from a hospital cohort and showed a high positive agreement (94%) as compared to paired nasopharyngeal swabs tested with a commercial diagnostic kit. Then, we partnered with the National Basketball Association (NBA) to test a large cohort of mostly healthy individuals, and we detected low rates of invalid (0.3%) and false-positive (0.03%-0.05%) results. Our study shows that SalivaDirect can help to increase testing capacity by providing access to an affordable framework that is less prone to supply chain shortages. necessary to quell the pandemic. Routine state-level screening and surveillance of healthy individuals is particularly important for safe reopening of the economy and schools and can minimize the risk of relapsing local outbreaks. However, the scalability and availability of currently authorized assays for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic testing are still limited, and large-scale application is hampered by worldwide supply chain issues. 5 To overcome these challenges, mass testing efforts must be (1) safe, both at the point of specimen collection and specimen processing; (2) affordable; (3) flexible, without the need for specific reagents or instrumentation from specific vendors; (4) adaptable to high-throughput workflows; and (5) amenable to quick turnaround times. While several different types of diagnostic assays have been recently authorized for emergency use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) such as qRT-PCR, LAMP, CRISPR, and sequencing-based assays, alternatives are still needed for large-scale testing efforts. 6 Based on established diagnostic practices for other respiratory infections, the nasopharyngeal swab was initially adopted as the preferred sampling technique for SARS-CoV-2. However, we and others have shown that saliva can serve as an alternative upper respiratory tract specimen type for SARS-CoV-2 detection. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] This is significant as saliva offers a number of advantages over nasopharyngeal swabs when considering the aforementioned criteria for mass testing efforts. Specifically, saliva does not require a certified swab and collection receptacle and does not necessarily have to be obtained by a skilled healthcare provider, both of which increase diagnostic-associated costs. Nasopharyngeal sampling requires a swab being inserted into the back of the nares, which can cause irritation that could promote sneezing and coughing. Thus, the noninvasive collection of saliva is safer, as it protects healthcare workers from being inadvertently exposed to potentially infectious droplets. In addition to being more affordable and safer, collection of nasopharyngeal swabs has been associated with variable, inconsistent, and false-negative test results due to the technical difficulties of taking a proper swab. 10, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] To increase testing capacity for large-scale screening efforts, we developed Saliva-Direct, a saliva-based, nucleic-acid-extraction-free, dualplex qRT-PCR method for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Our approach can be broadly implemented, as it does not require expensive saliva collection tubes containing preservatives 20 and does not require specialized reagents or equipment for nucleic acid extraction. We validated SalivaDirect for use with products from multiple vendors. Thus, the simplicity and flexibility of SalivaDirect mean that it will not be as affected by supply chain bottlenecks as some other assays that rely on swabs and/or nucleic acid extraction. We show that SalivaDirect has a low limit of detection (6-12 copies/mL) and yields highly concordant results as compared to currently validated qRT-PCR assays. The unique features of SalivaDirect is that it is noninvasive, less expensive ($1.21-$4.39/sample in reagents), and validated for use with reagents and instruments from multiple vendors. Through our partnerships with the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Basketball Players Association (NBPA), we conducted a large usability study of SalivaDirect and comparison to standard qRT-PCR testing of paired anterior nares/oropharyngeal (AN/OP) swabs for asymptomatic/presymptomatic detection of SARS-CoV-2. Our results demonstrate how our specialized protocols for saliva collection produce mostly valid specimens for testing (99.7%), and the specificity of SalivaDirect leads to very few false-positive results (0.03%-0.05%), showcasing that SalivaDirect, and saliva testing in general, can be used to enhance large-scale testing of symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals. The data presented here were used to support our Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for SalivaDirect granted by the FDA on August 15th, 2020. 21",

We quantified the virus copies from a positive saliva specimen and spiked-in different concentrations of the positive sample to achieve concentrations of 12, 25, and 50 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL into negative saliva collected from healthcare workers. 10 After 7 days, we tested the spiked-in saliva specimens with SalivaDirect and compared results to ''fresh'' samples. We found that SARS-CoV-2 detection was stable in saliva for at least 7 days at each of the three thermal conditions ( Figure 1B) . Surprisingly, we even detected significantly lower N1 cycle threshold (Ct) values (e.g., better detection) when saliva was kept for 7 days at 30 C as compared to fresh specimens (median difference across concentrations of 1.4 Ct, p = 0.03; Figure 1B ). In contrast, we found that Ct values for human RNase P (RP) were significantly higher after 7 days at room temperature (median difference of 3.8 Ct, p < 0.01) or 30 C (median difference of 5.0 Ct, p < 0.001) as compared to fresh specimens, which suggests that the human RNA degraded over time (Figure S1 ). We observed similar patterns when testing additional temperature profiles that the samples may encounter during transport, with no significant differences between N1 Ct values for fresh samples as compared to samples kept at 40 C for 72 h (p > 0.99) or samples kept under summer (alternating 28 C-40 C; p = 0.54) or winter profiles (alternating \u00c020 C to room temperature; p > 0.99; Figure S2 ). Moreover, in a parallel clinical study, we showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA from saliva collected from COVID-19 patients without preservatives is stable at 30 C for at least 3 days (n = 20) and at room temperature for up to 25 days (n = 20), though the samples were tested by a standard PCR test and not SalivaDirect. 20 Thus, our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA, or at least the targeted nucleocapsid RNA, is stable in saliva without preservatives for at least 3 days, and likely longer, when stored at temperatures of up to 40 C.",

Previous studies have shown that the nucleic acid extraction step can be omitted with a relatively small impact on analytical sensitivity. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Therefore, we explored the potential of proteinase K and heat as an affordable, fast, and easy alternative to nucleic acid extraction. We used the modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) assay 29 to compare qRT-PCR detection of SARS-CoV-2 in saliva specimens processed with nucleic acid extraction or by simply mixing the specimen with proteinase K followed by heat inactivation ( Figure 1C ). As compared to nucleic acid extraction, our data show that our extraction-free approach minimally decreases detection (median N1 Ct increase = 1.8 Ct; p < 0.01). The reduction in detection that we observed is equivalent to what we would expect from omitting the $4-fold concentration step that occurs during nucleic acid extraction. Our findings demonstrate that proteinase K and heat can be used as an alternative to nucleic acid extraction with only a minor loss in sensitivity.",

We previously showed that SARS-CoV-2 detection by the N1 primer-probe set is more consistent and stronger as compared to N2. 29 Therefore, to further simplify the qRT-PCR assay, we developed a dualplex qRT-PCR assay based on N1 and RP and modified the fluorophore (Cy5, ATTO647, or Quasar670 instead of FAM) on the RP probe. When comparing the modified singleplex CDC assay with the dualplex assay on extracted nucleic acid, median N1 Ct values were 0.9 Ct lower when tested in multiplex (p < 0.01; Figure 1D ). Thus, SalivaDirect allows for a reduction in the number of qRT-PCR reactions to one reaction per sample.",

A current list of validated products can be found in our updated EUA summary. 21 To validate reagents and instruments, we spiked a known concentration of SARS-CoV-2-positive saliva into negative saliva from healthcare workers to prepare a 2fold dilution series of 400, 200, 100, 50, 25, 12, and 6 virus copies/mL. By testing each concentration in triplicate, we determined the preliminary limit of detection, which was then confirmed by testing another 20 replicates ( Figure 2 ).

We found that the Bio-Rad CFX96 and ABI 7500 Fast had similar lower limits of detection at 12 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL, whereas the ABI 7500 Fast Dx had a slightly lower limit of detection of 6 SARS-CoV-2 copies/mL ( Figures 2G-2I ). Interestingly, when determining the preliminary limit of detection for the ABI 7500 Fast Dx, we found that Ct values were on average 4.7 lower than Ct values generated on the ABI 7500 Fast. This suggests a difference in the auto-threshold that the machine sets, and therefore, we have increased the positive threshold to 37 Ct for the ABI 7500 Fast Dx to correspond to the positive threshold for the ThermoFisher Scientific Taq-Path COVID-19 combo kit using the ABI 7500 Fast Dx. Changing the threshold did not affect the confirmed lower limit of detection of 6 copies/mL for the ABI 7500 Fast Dx.

Overall, the reduction in analytical sensitivity contributed to a 7.3% (3/41) false-negative rate for Sali-vaDirect, but only for weakly positive samples (all three false-negative specimens had N1 Ct values of 35-40 when using the modified CDC assay; Figure 3 ).

For example, in a study with 124 symptomatic outpatients without optimized saliva collection protocols, approximately one-third of the samples were difficult to pipet. 33 In our NBA cohort study, we developed explicit instructions on how to collect true saliva, 34,35 used a saliva collection aid (a straw that fits into the collection tube) to promote providing true saliva and minimize potential aerosolization, and added proteinase K as the first laboratory step to help degrade any mucus. As a result, all 3,779 saliva samples collected from the cohort could be tested by Sal-ivaDirect. Furthermore, the use of the RP human control gene in the dualplex PCR helps to determine if there are inhibitors in the specimens. We found that 12 of the 3,779 saliva samples had RP values above a Ct of 35, the threshold for an invalid sample (Table 2; Figure S5A ). Thus 0.3% of the saliva samples collected from our cohort were invalid by PCR. Overall, we had a high rate of success for testing saliva by SalivaDirect.",

            "text": "In the rush to develop and authorize SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests, 37 sparse and unstandardized data made it difficult to compare the performance. This led to several independent evaluations of SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic tests or test components, 29,38-43 though these were not always comprehensive enough to help clinicians or public health officials to determine which to use in the sea of growing options. To better establish true performance and directly compare among assays, the FDA developed reference material to establish an absolute limit of detection for each assay. 37 We participated in this post-authorization validation using our least sensitive combination of reagents and equipment: ThermoFisher proteinase K, ThermoFisher TaqPath RT-qPCR Master Mix, and the Bio-Rad CFX96 thermocycler (detailed in our EUA summary 21 ). Our measured limit of detection with the FDA reference material was 18 detectable units/mL (18,000 units/mL), similar to what we measured in this study (12 copies/mL). Compared to other FDA EUA authorized SARS-CoV-2 PCR tests, SalivaDirect has a limit of detection similar to or better than most manufactured PCR assays for swabs with RNA extraction (range = 540-540,000 units/mL), including the CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel (18,000 units/mL). 44 Furthermore, SalivaDirect is one of only seven PCR tests that completed the reference panel for saliva, and based on the detection limit ranges (600-180,000 units/mL), SalivaDirect has intermediate overall performance and is approximately three times more sensitive than the Fluidigm Advanta Dx SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Assay (54,000 units/mL). 44 Finally, as expected for a PCR assay, the limit of detection for SalivaDirect is substantially better than antigen based tests, including the Abbott ID NOW COVID-19 test (300,000 units/mL) and the Quidel Lyra Direct SARS-CoV-2 Assay (540,000 units/mL). 44 Thus the analytical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 detection for SalivaDirect is similar to many other PCR tests with RNA extraction using swabs or saliva, and it is more sensitive than the rapid antigen tests.",

            "text": "One of our motivating factors behind developing SalivaDirect was to help reduce the costs of PCR testing. Most manufacturers and laboratories do not make their SARS-CoV-2 testing prices easily available to the public. However, those that do show that the cost to the individual being tested is typically between $100 and $250, sometimes with additional expenses for sample collection and/or shipping. [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] While these prices may be justifiable for diagnostic testing covered by health insurance, they are not conducive for large-scale screening. By removing the need for swabs, expensive saliva collection devices, 20 RNA extraction reagents, and kits manufactured specifically for SARS-CoV-2, we reduced the raw supply costs to $1.21-4.39 per sample. Even with that, some have argued that the labor of processing saliva samples ends up making SalivaDirect more expensive than swab-based tests. 50 In reality, most of our more than 50 designated laboratories are offering SalivaDirect to the public for $25 or less, citing the inexpensive reagents and simplified workflow as the driving forces for the reduced costs. While these prices are similar to isothermal methods (e.g., LAMP assays), 51 SalivaDirect will be more expensive than some of the less sensitive rapid antigen tests, such as the Abbott BinaxNOW being offered at a subsidized cost of $5 per test. 52 Our hope is that other government subsidies and/or pooling approaches will further reduce the costs associated with testing saliva for SARS-CoV-2 by PCR to aid large-scale screening programs. 53, 54 Target Populations and Testing Approaches There is an increasing debate over the appropriate uses of high-sensitivity diagnostic tests (primarily PCR) and rapid lower sensitivity screening tests (primarily antigen). 55 This revolves around the need to shift from clinical diagnostics, in which the demand has mostly been met, to population-level routine screening for safe reopenings. 56 There is a reason why most schools, for example, do not have testing programs in place, despite the obvious need for them: most available local testing options are from low-capacity clinical labs offering primarily expensive swab-based tests, sometimes with long (>48 hour) turnaround times. Until rapid and inexpensive tests become widely available, there is a critical need to increase the capacities of existing labs and expand access to saliva-based tests.",

Through our partnerships with the NBA and NBPA, we conducted the largest evaluation to date of saliva to swabs (AN/OP combined) for screening of healthy individuals. Importantly, the saliva collection for this study was observed by individuals without healthcare training, and still 99.7% of the samples were valid for PCR testing (i.e., samples could be pipetted and human control values were acceptable), showcasing how saliva could be used in non-healthcare settings.

Additional precautions should be taken during saliva collection where the individual may contaminate the sample collection tube through their breath or by directly spilling saliva on the outside surfaces. Because of this, we outline in our protocol (which was reviewed by the FDA) to disinfect the outside of the tube with 70% ethanol and for the clinical and laboratory staff to always wear gloves when handling the tubes. We do not believe that our method of collecting saliva without preservatives, as some other methods use, 32,61-63 makes the samples any more hazardous to handle. First, anything added to the inside of the tubes would not help with saliva spilled on the outside. Second, preservatives were included in some tests to stabilize the genetic material, and to our knowledge, none of the commercial preservatives have been evaluated for inactivating SARS-CoV-2. Finally, SARS-CoV-2 RNA is still considered as a biosafety level 2 risk, and thus, even inactivated samples should be handled with caution. Thus, as similar to nasal swabs, collecting saliva contains risks to the collector and laboratory staff that can be minimized through following proper safety protocols.",

While our previous analysis indicates that saliva is more sensitive for SARS-CoV-2 detection than nasopharyngeal swabs in COVID-19 inpatients, 10 saliva can contain blood, mucus, or foreign substances (e.g., food, drink, or tobacco), which can interfere with PCR or make it difficult to pipet. 33 We can overcome many of these issues by having specific collection procedures for saliva collection and using proteinase K to make samples easier to pipet, but some samples can still be invalid if they are not collected properly. While we show that invalid samples are rare from our NBA cohort, our study was biased toward adult men. Thus we were not able to test our approach in two key demographics: elderly individuals (>65 years of age) who are the most at risk for disease and school-aged children (<18 years of age) who critically need testing to help support in-person learning, though others have recently demonstrated that saliva is a suitable specimen for pediatric testing. 64 Moreover, including professional athletes in our trial of repeat SARS-CoV-2 screening may not be representative of the general population, and we will therefore continue to monitor any laboratories using SalivaDirect for asymptomatic screening.",

However, this second virus target was removed from the final assay, because unlike the promising results with extracted nucleic acid, 31 we were not able to consistently detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva treated with proteinase K and heat (Table S1 ). Thus, the final SalivaDirect dualplex RT-qPCR assay consisted of the N1 and RP primer-probe sets.",

We found no differences in the limit of detection between proteinase K from three vendors and therefore selected one (ThermoFisher Scientific MagMAX proteinase K) to validate the three RT-qPCR kits.
