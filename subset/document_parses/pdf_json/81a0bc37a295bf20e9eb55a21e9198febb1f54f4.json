They are \"subjective claims the individual [teacher] accepts as being true\" (Buehl & Beck, 2015, p. 67) which dictate what the teacher says and does in the classroom (Farrell & Guz, 2019) . Pedagogical beliefs, according to a large body of research, influence many elements of teachers' profession. They inform teachers' pedagogical decisions (Aksoy, 2015; Levin et al., 2013; Thibaut et al., 2018) , instructional practices (Kim et al., 2013; Lebak, 2015; Wong & Luft, 2015) , learning environment or classroom climate (Levin, 2015; Li, 2013; Rubie-Davies, 2015) and professional development (Buehl & Beck, 2015; Zhang & Liu, 2014) . To put it in a nutshell, beliefs serve as \"filters for interpretation, frames for defining problems, and guides or standards for action\" (Fives & Buehl, 2012, p.478) .",

Ethiopia is currently undertaking a new educational reform known as 'The New Education Development Road map' (MoE, 2018) . As the reform was primarily induced by the political change the country witnessed recently, the new government seems determined to heal the Achilles' heel of the old education system which was its failure to equip the youth with the required citizenship competences. Hence, we believe that it is a high time to examine Civics and Ethical teachers' pedagogical beliefs and practices so that policy makers can understand teachers' beliefs in order to amend, remodel, or reconstruct any policy that has direct repercussions in pedagogical practices (Karim et al., 2020) .",

Various policy documents, notably the 1994 Education and Training Policy (Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, 1994) , the Teacher Education System Overhaul (TESO) of 2003 (MoE, 2003 , and the Secondary School Curriculum Framework of 2009 (MoE, 2009) , have emphasized this transition.

The few studies undertaken on Civics and Ethical Education at various levels of the educational system (e.g. Addis, 2013; Birhanu, 2012; Dawit, 2006; Endalkachew, 2016; Fetene, 2017; Girma, 2006; Gosa, 2018; Meron, 2006; Molalign, 2012; Mulugeta, 2009) reported either the subject's ineffectiveness in bringing about the anticipated changes in students' behavior or CEE teachers' incapacity to use proper instructional methods in their classrooms. Some even blamed it for the country's escalating ethnic tension which was partly caused by improper schooling. Officially acknowledging that CEE so far has not produced the anticipated results, a study commissioned by the Policy Study and Research Center (2017) ascribed the problem in part on teachers' incapability (Waltainfo, 2017) . This issue was also recently confirmed by the government, which stated that the Education and Training Policy should be reviewed to ensure that it clearly articulates the balance between plurality and national unity in light of a new concept of being both a patriot and a nationalist (MoE, 2018) .",

Thus, constructivist pedagogies are recommended in Civics and Ethical Education not only for their academic benefits, but also because they are the essential dispositions that effective citizens require in their daily lives. Simply put, citizenship education (Civics and Ethical Education) needs to include constructivist pedagogies as its important components if it is to produce democratic, critical citizens who actively and responsibly participate in society (Althof & Berkowitz, 2006; Haste, 2004) .",

Learning should serve learners' personal experiences because people develop knowledge and meaning via their own experiences (Riegler & Quale, 2010) . Its proponents advocate that reasoning, critical thinking, knowledge construction and application, self-regulation, and mindful reflection are the goals of constructivist learning (Bailey & Colley, 2015) . As a result, a constructivist approach to learning allows students to have tangible, contextually meaningful experiences in which they can self-organize, invent, discover patterns, be curious, raise questions and hypotheses, model, analyze, and support their views. Our research focuses on how teachers' beliefs impact their perceived classroom practices. By implication, it also provides an important lens through which one may examine how students construct knowledge in secondary school CEE classrooms. Accordingly, we used constructivism as the primary theoretical framework.",

The CLES has been used and validated in many studies (e.g. Aldridge et al., 2000) . The original CLES comprised of five scales (30 items) related to corresponding aspects of constructivism, namely; Personal Relevance (e.g. \"Students learn about the world outside of school\"), Uncertainty (e.g. \"Students learn that social realities (ideas) are influenced by people's cultural values and opinions\"), Critical Voice (e.g. \"Students can express concern about anything that prevents them from learning\"), Shared Control (e.g. \"Students help me to decide how well they are learning\") and Student Negotiation (e.g. \"Students can freely express their opinion, even when it was different from other students\") (Taylor et al., 1997) . CLES has a 5-point Likert-type frequency response scale which comprises the categories: Almost Always (5), Often (4), Sometimes (3) Seldom (2), and Almost Never (1). In this study, based on input from the pilot study and subsequent development by other researchers who used the instrument in their investigations, each sub-scale was reduced to five items.

As presented in Table 1 , all constructs demonstrated satisfactory convergent validity. Additionally, the Maximum Shared Squared Variance (MSV) for all constructs is less than AVE and the square root of AVE is higher than their correlation value, confirming discriminant validity. If MSV is less than AVE and Square root of AVE much more than inter-construct correlations then discriminant validity is established. Another way to show the evidence of discriminant validity is to use the average shared squared variance (ASV). Discriminant validity can be achieved when the AVE is greater than the ASV (Collier, 2020) . The ASV was computed by averaging the inter-construct squared correlation. Table 1 shows that the AVE values of all factors are higher than the ASV which indicates discriminant validity.",

Except for Levene's test of equality of error variances for one of the three variables (i.e. constructivist belief ), the data met all of the assumptions. Pallant (2016) recommends using a more conservative alpha threshold for establishing significance for that variable in the univariate F-test if the data violates the equality of variances assumption. Similarly, Tabachnick and Fidell (2013) recommend an alpha of.025 or.01 instead of the conventional 0.05 level. As a result, during the Univariate F-test, an alpha value of.017 was used. Pillai's Trace was employed in this investigation because it is more reliable when assumptions are violated (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2013) .",

Multicollinearity was checked by running correlation to check the strength of the correlations among the independent variables.

In this study, the correlation between the two independent variables (i.e. traditional belief and constructivist belief ) was, r = -0.36, which according to Pallant (2016) is not a concern.

The tolerance and VIF values for the two variables were found to be 0.87 and 1.15, respectively, with CI values of 1.00-20.89. The result revealed that there is no problem of multicollinearity between the independent variables because the VIF is less than 10 and the CI is likewise less than 30 (Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007) .

First, despite the on-the-job trainings provided to reorient teachers' beliefs and practices, older teachers were more devoted to their previous techniques of \"talk and chalk\" teaching. This is consistent with what academics (e.g., Skott, 2015) refer to as the changeresistant nature of teacher belief. According to Pajares (1992) , the sooner a belief is absorbed into the beliefs system, the longer it is employed, and thus the stronger and more commanding it becomes to the person who holds it. In the present study's context, traditional beliefs about how people learn or how people teach others were incorporated into CEE teachers' beliefs structure early during childhood and early schooling. Teachers, on the other hand, learn about constructivism pedagogy later in their careers, at initial or in-service teacher training. Traditional beliefs are; therefore, basic beliefs and naturally significant to CEE teachers since they have grown up with and used them regularly in previous cognitive processes (Hutner & Markman, 2016) . Mansour (2013) confirmed that the belief-practice alignment was closer when teachers held more traditional beliefs and more divergent when they held constructivist belief.",

This appears to be especially true in Ethiopia, where CEE is heavily regulated and regarded a politicized matter. As a result, even though CEE teachers advocate constructivism and are committed to put it into practice, factors such as school ethos, curriculum, exams and timetables may be found unaccommodating. The hidden curriculum; therefore, leaves no choice to teachers except to retreat to their core belief i.e. traditional beliefs. To put it another way, teachers may find traditional teaching more practical under present school systems in an unsupportive school climate (Hutner & Markman, 2016) .",

The results indicated that there was a strong negative correlation between traditional belief and overall constructivist classroom practice. On the other hand, a significant positive, yet moderate relationship was observed between teachers' constructivist belief and overall constructivist practice. Interestingly, teachers reported a strong constructivist belief. Nonetheless, their constructive practice did not match up with their espoused belief. Teachers' overall constructivist classroom practice was found below the expected level, and only a moderate relationship was found between constructivist belief and constructivist practice. Conversely, a strong negative relationship was found between traditional belief and constructivist practice. The result partly suggests that teachers' reported belief was inconsistent with their actual practice. This finding agrees with several prior studies (e.g., Farrell & Vos, 2018; Guerra & Wubbena, 2017; Karim et al., 2020) which reported that teachers' reflected either ineffective implementation or no evidence of implementation of their professed beliefs.",

Classroom practice and beliefs become consistent when these external and internal factors match teachers' beliefs (Mansour, 2013) . Conversely, when these circumstances get in the way of teachers' convictions, classroom practice and beliefs become incongruent. Given their context, teachers may modify their beliefs to better fit their experience (Fives & Buehl, 2016) . Accordingly, complete understanding of secondary school CEE classroom practices is only possible with a thorough study of the contextual constraints and opportunities that impact them.

The study also poses several opportunities for further research. First, the authors recommend researchers to conduct additional studies using the adapted Amharic version of the CLES and CTLQ instruments which we validated in this study in a different setting or level of education. In our study, 45.8% of the variance in classroom practice was explained by teachers' pedagogical beliefs. This is quite substantial effect. It also tells us more than half of variance in teachers' practice can be explained by other contextual factors. Hence, we recommend researchers looking at the impact of contextual factors such as school climate and perceived teacher autonomy on teachers' beliefs and practices. This is particularly intriguing in light of the findings of our study which revealed incongruity between constructivist belief and practice. Moreover, future studies need to incorporate qualitative element or conduct purely qualitative studies to deeply understand the 'why' part of CEE teachers' belief-practice incongruity. We also recommend conducting classroom observations and including student responses to further substantiate the results.",

Hence, this study only presents the quantitative findings of a mixed design investigation of CEE teachers' pedagogical beliefs and self-reported constructivist practices in comparison with selected demographic factors. This study did not include the results of interviews or classroom observation. As a result, neither the types of actual methods/strategies used by teachers in their classrooms nor the reasons for inconsistencies in their practices were incorporated. Though we strongly believe that classroom observation and interviews could have enriched the results of the study even further, the outbreak of the Corona virus (Covid 19) has been a restraint in direct observation of classrooms.",

Apart from this, we believe that the findings of our study could be helpful in understanding the current situation of CEE teaching in secondary schools of Ethiopia. ",
