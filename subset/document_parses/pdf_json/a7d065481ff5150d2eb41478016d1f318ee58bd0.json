We then establish in which regime one can expect the generic dimension-8 and lower order operators to be potentially observable while preserving causality, providing a theoretical prior for future observations.

The higher-dim operators capture the effects of the heavy fields that have been integrated out at tree-level, i.e. particles of spin \u2265 2. One would expect the scale \u039b to be the mass of the lightest higher spin state (s \u2265 2). Motivated by the recent detections of gravitational waves (GWs), there has been a surge of interest in establishing whether these operators could be probed assuming a very low \u039b. Such operators could indicate the presence of new physics beyond the standard model and potentially connect us with the dark sector. A formalism for probing those operators with inspiraling GWs was proposed in Ref. [7] . Finite size effects of black holes (BHs) have also been investigated in the presence of dim-8 operators [8] and dim-6 operators [9] [6] . Interestingly, LIGO and Virgo constraints on the dim-8 operators were explored in Ref. [11] . For related works see Refs. [12] [13] [14] [15] . While we may be on the edge of constraining gravitational EFTs using GW observations, theoretical considerations also have significant impact. For instance, requiring the low-energy EFTs to be embeddable in a local Wilsonian, unitary, Lorentz invariant and causal high energy completion like string theory imposes a set of positivity constraints on these EFTs [16, 17] . In parallel, it is well known that in gravitational EFTs, the sound speed can appear to be superluminal [9, [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , and by demanding the local group velocity of GWs to be (sub)luminal, it was shown in Ref. [18] that the coefficients of the dim-8 operators ought to be sign definite. In this Letter, we shall complement the state of the art by further investigating the constraints set by causality. Our requirements for preserving causality are similar to the ones indicated in Refs. [29] [30] [31] but differ from the notion of \"asymptotic causality\" or net (sub)luminality which is sometimes postulated in the literature. As we shall see, the \"asymptotic causality\" condition, while necessary is not sufficient for preserving causality and fails to identify situations which are known to be in tension with causality as inferred for instance from positivity bounds.",

It violates causality only if the time advance, calculable within the validity regime of the EFT, is resolvable. For causality to be respected, the front velocity should be luminal, meaning that the infinite frequency limit of the phase velocity should be luminal as dictated by the geometry seen by those highfrequency modes. As unitarity and analyticity (derived from causality) dictate that the phase velocity cannot decrease with frequency, this implies that low-frequency modes should necessarily be subluminal with respect to the local background geometry. Indeed, the equivalence principle implies that the high-frequency modes can only be sensitive to the local inertial frame, so causality is fixed by the background geometry seen by the highfrequency modes. At the level of a low-energy EFT, causality therefore demands that low-energy modes be (sub)luminal as compared to the background geometry, which in terms of observables requires that any support outside the light cone determined by the geometry be unresolvable, see [31] for more details. In other words, the statement of 'infrared causality' is violated if \u2212\u03b4T 1/\u03c9 (infrared acausality).",

Naturally, the effect of the dim-8 operator increases with \u03c9 as illustrated in Fig. 1 , however \u03c9 should be smaller than V max for the phase shift to be well approximated by (6) , [32] . For these reasons, we consider \u03b3 = 0.9, so that \u03c9 \u221d at large , and the impact parameter is constant. We compute the condition (9) numerically and present the results in Fig. 2 Crucially we see that if c 1 = \u22121, the even sector always violates the notion of infrared causality. In that case, the even modes lead to a time advance with \u03b4t + increasing quadratically with the multipole , while \u03c9 increases linearly as \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, both sides of the inequality (9) decrease as \u22123 at large . Explicit calculation shows that the left hand side of the inequality (9) is smaller than its right hand side (cf. Fig. 2 ).

While such a low cutoff can lead to a potentially interesting phenomenology, it also comes hand in hand with violations of causality. We can push those bounds further by considering BHs with arbitrarily small mass, which would lead to a constraint on c 1 /\u039b 6 to be arbitrarily small. In particular, BHs with radii as small as the fundamental scale of quantum gravity M Fund would force the scale \u039b to be associated to that scale \u039b \u223c M Fund in the case where no other dim-6 and -8 operators are considered.",

Yet we know from positivity bounds that such a situation would be in direct tension with causal and unitary requirements. This illustrates how the statement of asymptotic causality fails to properly diagnose violations of causality. These considerations further show how insisting instead on an unresolvability of the EFT time advance is precisely what is linked with causality considerations in known situations.",

We emphasize that the lower bound on \u039b is imposed only for the particular dim-8 model (2) .

Specifically, we assume the dim-6 operators are detectable if their corrections on the phase of observed inspiraling GWs, calculated within the EFT validity regime, is greater than O(1 [38] In principle, it seems quite reasonable that BHs as light as the Chandrasekhar limit could exist, pushing the bound to \u039b 10 \u221210 eV. However one would expect BHs with radius as small as the fundamental scale of quantum gravity M Fund \u2264 M Pl could exist.

In other words, if we assume the absence of dim-6 operators and further demand that the dim-8 operators arise from the integration of particles of mass \u039b at tree-level (hence of higher spin), this directly implies that the scale at which those higher spin enters has to be related to the fundamental scale of quantum gravity.",

Therefore, in addition to the more familiar constraints on the background curvature (e.g. W 2 \u039b 4 ) we have constraints on the GWs which can be characterized by scalars constructed by the momentum of the on shell GWs k, the Weyl tensor W and its covariant derivative. For example, considering a transverse wave with k \u00b5 = (\u2212\u03c9, 0, 0, \u00b1\u03c9r 1/2 sin \u03b8/ 1 \u2212 r g /r), the EFT validity requires [31] \u03c9 \u039b 2 r r r g \u2212 1",

The validity condition (4) also applies when we consider scattering in the presence of other higher-dim operators when considering a generic gravitational EFT. The EFT contribution to the time delay is given by \u03b4T = \u2212(b2 + 4b3)\u00b5 \u03b4t , so when b2 + 4b3 = +1 the odd modes enjoy a time advance, while for the even modes, the time advance is too small to be resolvable in the regime of validity of the EFT.

            "text": "GWs can be considered as metric perturbations propagating on a background metricwhere\u1e21 \u00b5\u03bd is the background metric, and h \u00b1 \u00b5\u03bd are the metric perturbations. Here we have decomposed the metric perturbations into their odd-and even-parity modes, labeled by \u2212 and + respectively. For the background, we focus on the static and spherically symmetric BH, which is described by the Schwarzschild metric in GR. In the presence of higher-dimension operators, the Schwarzschild solution usually receives corrections, and the background metric, up to the leading EFT corrections, can be written as [8, 9] where f (r) = 1 \u2212 2GM/r with M being the ADM mass of the BH, and \u00b5 \u03b4f t/r are the leading EFT corrections with \u00b5 being a dimensionless parameter counting the order of the EFT corrections. In the presence of the dim-8 operators, the dimensionless parameter \u00b5 is given by \u00b5 = (GM \u039b) \u22126 . For any meaningful BH \u00b5 is always much less than 1. For instance, \u00b5 \u223c 10 \u22128 for a 30M BH even assuming a cutoff as incredibly low as \u039b \u223c 10 \u221210 eV. For reference, in 8 Ref. [11] , the effects of the EFT (2) on the waveform of GWs emitted during the inspiral of BHs was considered for a cutoff as low as \u039b \u223c 10 \u221213 eV, and hence \u00b5 > 1. In this case, the EFT fails to described the geometry near the BH horizon as well as to predicts the finite-size effects of the BH. Nevertheless, it could be valid in describing the inspiral GWs, as then the energy scale can be well below the EFT cutoff scale. In the case of dim-6 operators, the dimensionless parameter \u00b5 is given by \u00b5 = (GM \u039b) \u22124 .In order to separate the radial dependence from the time and angular dependence, we can decompose the metric perturbations h \u00b1 \u00b5\u03bd into tensor spherical Harmonics in frequency domain,andwhere Y m are the spherical harmonics, andHere h 0 , h 1 , h 2 , H 0 , H 1 , H 2 , H 0 , H 1 , K and G are the radial functions that depend only on r. Substituting the above ansatz into perturbation equations leads to a set of equations of the radial functions, which can be further combined into two single master equations. In classical GR, the two master equations are the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations,withwhere r g = 2GM , x = r/r g and \u03bb = ( + 1) \u2212 2.Including higher dimension operators generally results in higher-derivative terms in the field equations. Within the EFT validity regime, these terms ought be treated perturbatively, and hence can be replaced using the lower order field equations [8, 9] (also see Ref. [47] for a generic prescription). On doing so, we can obtained the Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations with the EFT corrections. Up to O(\u00b5), the corrected Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations can be written as [8] ,where r * is tortoise coordinate defined by dr * = dr/ (f + \u00b5 \u03b4f t )(f + \u00b5 \u03b4f r ), and V \u00b1 GR are the potentials in the noncorrected Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli equations. Comparing to Eq. (3), we have absorbed the coefficients of the higherdimension operators in V \u00b1 in Eq. (B10). For dim-6 operators, we have \u00b5 = 1/(GM \u039b) 4 andAppendix D: Scattering phase shift and time delayThe phase shift of GWs when scattering on a BH can be inferred using the WKB approximation which agrees with the more familiar classical time delay calculations. For GWs with \u03c9 2 < |V GR |, the phase shift is given by Eq. (5) , and hence the time delay isExpanding to the leading order in \u00b5 gives the leading EFT corrections on the time delay,where r T * , r T and \u03b4r T denotes the turning point in tortoise coordinate, in the usual radial coordinate and the leading EFT corrections on the turning point, and \u03b4f is defined asTo avoid divergence at the turning point, it is useful to defineand explicit calculation yields [30] As stated in the letter, avoiding a causal-violating time advance in the model (2) imposes a lower bound on the cutoff \u039b. We emphasize that the lower bound is imposed only on the model (2) however general dim-8 EFTs usually involve both the c 1 and c 2 operators as if for instance the case in type II string theory [39] after compactification [40] , where c 1 = c 2 > 0. In this case, time advance caused by the c 1 operator in the odd sector can be compensated by the time delay caused by the c 2 operators when c 1 and c 2 are positive. As a result, if c 2 /c 1 \u223c O(1), and if c 1 and c 2 are both positive, there will be no causal violating time advance in the odd sector, nor will there be any lower bound on the cutoff scale \u039b from infrared causality considerations.This formula also applies for the dim-6 operators. In particular, for the dim-6 operator with coefficient b 1 , the time delay and the parameter space of causal-violating time advance are shown in Fig. 4 . The dim-6 operators with coefficients b 2 and b 3 contribute to the time delay in the same manner, and the time delay and the parameter space of causal-violating time advance are shown in Fig. 5 .",
