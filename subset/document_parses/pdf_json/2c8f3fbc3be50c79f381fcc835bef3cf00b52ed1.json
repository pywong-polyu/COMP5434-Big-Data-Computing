In order to control this ongoing waves of epidemiological infections, attempts have been made to understand the dynamics of this pandemic in deterministic approach with the help of several mathematical models. In this article characteristics of a multi-wave SIR model have been studied which successfully explains the features of this pandemic waves in India. Stability of this model has been studied by identifying the equilibrium points as well as by finding the eigen values of the corresponding Jacobian matrices. Complex eigen values are found which ultimately give rise to the oscillatory solutions for the three categories of populations, say, susceptible, infected and removed. In this model, a finite probability of the recovered people for becoming susceptible again is introduced which eventually lead to the oscillatory solution in other words. The set of differential equations has been solved numerically in order to obtain the variation for numbers of susceptible, infected and removed people with time. In this phenomenological study, finally an additional modification is made in order to explain the aperiodic oscillation which is found necessary to capture the feature of epidemiological waves particularly in India.",

This highly contagious disease has been transmitted to millions of people globally where a fraction of infected people is succumbed to it eventually. Most of the countries witness multiple peaks of epidemiological infections in its evolution which is counted as number of waves. Among the most affected countries, for example, countries in European union (CEU), USA, Russia and Canada experience five successive epidemiological waves while the third wave is going on in India, Indonesia and Brazil. Which means that five peaks of the epidemiological infections are found in CEU, USA, Russia and Canada, while three distinct peaks are noted in India, Indonesia and Brazil. However, peaks of epidemiological infections in India are sharper than those found in Brazil. So, it is obvious that characteristics of these epidemiological waves found in different countries are not similar. Widths and heights of the peaks are different as well as the separation between them are not equal. It is observed that the same individual gets infected multiple time during this pandemic in all countries.",

            "text": "In order to study the dynamics of the pandemic in a deterministic approach, several models have been proposed based on the classic SIR model introduced by Kermack and Mckendrick in 1927. [1] Most of the models are * Electronic address: kalpita\u02d9das@yahoo.co.in \u2020 Electronic address: asimk.ghosh@jadavpuruniversity.in mainly formulated to study the characteristics of the first wave of the pandemic. Those are known as SEIR, SIQR and their hybrids which are all derived from the singlewave SIR (SWSIR) model. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] It is termed as SWSIR model because of the fact that this primitive version in general yields a solitary peak in its evolution. In those attempts, effects of quarantine, isolation, latent time of infection and other factors are taken into account where several predictions and forecasts are available. [7, 8] Nonetheless, periodic outbreak of disease in terms of SIR, SIQR, and SEIQR models are studied analytically in great details. [9] [10] [11] [12] Evolution of the COVID-19 pandemic for different countries have been studied with the help of those models where origin of differences in its features are explained. Case studies on few countries are available. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Hence, a multi-wave SIR (MWSIR) model is formulated by modifying the SWSIR model in order to explain the dynamics of epidemiological infections including the origin of multiple waves found in the infection pattern. This is a fact that the same individual has been infected repeatedly during this pandemic period. So in this model, probability of the same individual for getting infected multiple times after curing is taken into account. [21] Time delay between successive infections of the same individual is introduced in the MWSIR model. In this work, periodic outbreak of COVID-19 in India will be studied, and so, the daily new cases in terms of sevenday rolling average in India during January 30, 2020 to February 3, 2022 (736 days) are shown in Figure 1 . It reveals that the duration of those waves are different, so, it is not perfectly periodic. The approximate duration of first and second waves are T 1 = 370 and T 2 = 300 days, respectively, while the third wave crosses 66 days (T 3 > 66) by this time. Hence, separation between adja- cent peaks are different. In addition to that width and height of the peaks are unequal.",

The model incorporates the fact that the recovered people become susceptible again after the mean period \u03c4 . [21] However, I(t\u2212 \u03c4 ) = 0, when t < \u03c4 . The SWSIR model will be restored when \u00b5 = 0, and \u03b3 = 0. The system in this formulation is closed in a sense that the total population, N = S(t) + I(t) + R(t), does not change with time, which means the rate at which individual suffers natural mortality is also given by the parameter \u00b5. In other words, mean lifespan of individual turns out to be 1/\u00b5. In the same way, 1/\u03b2 can be regarded as the mean recovery time for the infected individual. The flowchart of this model is shown in Figure 2 . The basic reproduction number, R 0 plays an important role in epidemiology, which is defined as average number of new infections per infected individual. So, in this three-compartment system, it is equal to the transmission rate multiplied by the infectious period, R 0 = \u03b1/(\u03b2 + \u00b5).

However the difference, T \u2212\u03c4 vanishes with the increase of \u03c4 . This feature is shown in Fig 4 where variations of time period T along with relative difference between T and \u03c4 or (T \u2212\u03c4 )/\u03c4 with \u03c4 are plotted. The variation of T with \u03b1 and \u03b2 for fixed value of \u03c4 is shown in Figure 5 . It clearly indicates that T > \u03c4 , for any values of \u03b1 and \u03b2. Moreover, the difference, T \u2212 \u03c4 steadily decreases with \u03b1 but increases gradually with \u03b2. Features of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemiological waves in India are shown in Figure 1 . It reveals that the duration of successive waves are decreasing as T 1 > T 2 > T 3 . On the other hand, amplitude of the second wave is the maximum while the third wave is expected to cross its peak by this time. These features suggest that the prevailing waves are not periodic by any means. Hence the MWSIR model is further modified in order to explain this aperiodic behavior. One can remember that transformation of SWSIR to MWSIR is accomplished by introducing two parameters \u03b3 and \u03c4 , where \u03b3 is the rate at which the recovered people become susceptible again, while \u03c4 is the time delay to estimate the number of susceptible people in terms of infected people.",

The relation, \u03b3 2 < \u03b3 1 , corresponds to the fact that height of third peak is lower than the second one. The value, \u03b2 = 1/14, is kept fixed as it corresponds to the mean recovery period of COVID-19, 1/\u03b2 = 14 days. The numerical data obtained by solving the MWSIR model is plotted in red dashed line and compared with the daily new COVID-19 cases (seven-day rolling average) in India shown in blue sold line. A very good agreement is found when the rate of infection is assumed very small (\u03b1 = 1.78 \u00d7 10 \u22127 ). This phenomenological study predicts that 16.6% of individuals infected during January 30, 2020 to December 5, 2020 (first wave) become susceptible again for further infection. Similarly, 5.6% of individuals infected during December 5, 2020 to May, 27, 2021 (second wave) become susceptible again for the next infection. This reduction may account the effects of quarantine, isolation, vaccination and other preventive measures. However, as the solutions of the non-linear equations are highly sensitive to the initial conditions, like S(0), I(0), and R(0), estimated values of the parameters, \u03b1, \u03b3, \u03bd and \u03c4 are likely to change dramatically with the change of initial values.

The model is deigned in such a fashion that it is able to yield periodic as well as aperiodic epidemiological waves with varying widths and heights by tuning its parameters. As the SARS-CoV-2 virus responsible for the COVID-19 is highly infectious, the spreading of this disease cannot be controlled easily by means of simple preventive measures like quarantine, isolation, lock down and even vaccination. As a result, in due course, a sizable fraction of recovered people gets infected multiple times leading to multiple waves of the epidemiological infection. In order to explain this particular feature, the SIR model has been modified in such a manner that the recovered people has a finite chance for becoming susceptible again after their recovery in this modified version. Estimated values of the parameters obtained in this study will be useful for imposing restrictions to control the pandemic.",

Which means that the discrepancy between theoretical estimation and daily new cases can be removed further by formulating multi-wave SEIR, SIQR, SEIQR and other hybrid models.
