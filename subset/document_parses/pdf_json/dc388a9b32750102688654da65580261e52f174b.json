            "text": "Dyslipidemia is genetically susceptible. The difference in lipidrelated gene expression determines the diversity of serum lipid phenotypes. Several studies have reported associations between the SNPs in the EH domain-binding protein 1 gene (EHBP1) (Colafella and Denton, 2018) , tubulin beta class I gene (TUBB), and WW domain-containing oxidoreductase gene (WWOX) (Denis et al., 2011; Deng et al., 2020) and dyslipidemia (GBD 2016 Disease and Injury Incidence and Prevalence Collaborators, 2017; Diener and Hankey, 2020) , atherosclerosis and CAD. The mechanisms involved in lipid metabolism for these genes have been described. EHBP1 regulates vesicle transport by its encoded protein, binds endocytic vesicles to the actin cytoskeleton, and plays a core role in modulating glucose transporter 4 in adipocyte transport (Fan et al., 2019) . EHBP1 is an effector molecule for oncogene family member 8 (Rab8) and Rab10. Rab10-EHBP1-EHD2 forms a trimer complex that plays a critical role in hepatocyte lipid phagocytosis and the autophagic digestion of lipid droplets (Fuchs and Whelton, 2020) . The proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 gene (PCSK9) reduces the recycling of low-density lipoprotein receptors (LDLRs) and redirects LDLRs to late endosomes and lysosomes for degradation, facilitating an increase in serum lipids. A study found that the expression of the EHBP1 protein was downregulated in cells overexpressing PCSK9. This revealed the existence of the EHBP1 accompanying pathway linked to lipid metabolism (Gabb et al., 2016) . Moreover, SNPs of the rs2710642 and rs10496099 in the EHBP1 were correlated with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) (Giagtzoglou et al., 2013) and atherosclerosis (Golan et al., 2019) , respectively. The TUBB encodes \u03b2-tubulin. Mutations in TUBB cause microtubule damage, resulting in complex diseases (Denis et al., 2011) . A genome-wide association study (GWAS) analyzed the susceptibility to genetic variants of early-onset hyperlipidemia in 8,073 Japanese individuals (age \u226465 years) and found that the SNPs of the rs3132584 and rs3130685 in the TUBB were associated with serum LDL-C levels (Guilherme et al., 2004) . WWOX encodes a 414 amino acid protein that is involved in a variety of important cellular processes, including steroid metabolism. Studies have demonstrated that WWOX plays an important physiological role in lipid and lipoprotein metabolism in mouse and human genetic models. It is mediated through the ABCA1/apolipoprotein (Apo) A1 pathway, and it binds to a series of potential ligands of proline-rich PPxY motifs and other kinds of cell proteins. It is also involved in a variety of other pathways, including cholesterol homeostasis, fatty acid biosynthesis and triglyceride (TG) metabolism (Iatan et al., 2014; Hasan et al., 2020) , GWAS indicated that there was an association between the fasting lipid profile of 1,087 participants in an offspring cohort (mean age 47 years, 52% female) and WWOX. The correlation between the WWOX rs2222896AA genotype and LDL-C was two times that of the rs2222896AG or rs2222896 GG genotypes (Johannsen et al., 2018) . Additionally, the WWOX rs2278075 SNP was associated with CVD (p = 5.0 \u00d7 10 \u22129 ) (Joseph et al., 2017) . In a previous study in Guangxi Maonan population, we revealed that the EHBP1 rs2710642 and rs10496099, TUBB rs3132584 and rs3130685, and WWOX rs2222896 SNPs interacted with several environmental factors to modify blood lipid profiles (Kathiresan et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2020) . However, the association between these genes and the risk of CAD or IS in Chinese populations is unclear.",

Nonnormally distributed data are shown as interquartile ranges and medians, and differences in groups were determined by Mann-Whitney nonparametric tests. Differences in qualitative variables were analyzed by chi square tests. Associations between genotypes or haplotypes and continuous serum lipid levels were analyzed by multivariable linear regression. Differences in serum lipid levels associated with genotypes or haplotypes were considered statistically significant at p < 0.0004 or p < 0.0005, and G \u00d7 G or G \u00d7 E interactions were considered significant at p < 0.001 (corresponding to p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction for six SNPs and seven environmental factors).

The Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE), genotypic and haplotypic frequencies, and linkage disequilibrium (LD) described by D\u2032 and R 2 values were calculated by SHEsis online software (http://analysis.bio-x.cn/myAnalysis.php). Generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction (GMDR) online software (http://sourceforge.net/projects/gmdr/) was used to screen optimal SNP-SNP, haplotype-haplotype, G \u00d7 G, and G \u00d7 E interaction models. The models meet 10/10 crossvalidation consistency (CV) indicating 1,000 permutation tests; both training balance accuracy and test balance accuracy were \u226550%. Furthermore, all permutation tests had p < 0.001, suggesting their accuracy predictive value of diseases.

            "text": "Therefore, these SNPs might be associated with an aggravate risk of CAD or IS in CHB population. The interactions between EHBP1, TUBB, and WWOX and G \u00d7 E were involved in the pathogenesis of CAD and IS. The interaction of rs2710642 and rs2278075 SNPs was associated with higher risk of IS. The results also showed that the haplotype of rs2710642A-rs10496099C or rs2710642G-rs10496099C interacted with some factors (female sex, few cigarettes, and drinking, especially a small amount of alcohol) to significantly reduce the risk of IS. Some studies have shown that the level of sex hormones and complement of sex chromosomes determined sex differences in CVD patients. Many lifestyles and environmental factors (such as smoking, drinking, and diet) were associated with CVD in gender-specific ways. Differences in sex hormone-dependent receptors that control endothelial function may lead to increased CVD and IS risks in elderly men and postmenopausal women and a slightly lower risk of CVD and IS in premenopausal women (O'Keefe et al., 2018; Owolabi et al., 2018; Polfus et al., 2013) . Our study also found that female sex factor was independent or synergistic with lipid-related genes to modulate the risk of IS. The synergy between the haplotype H2 and hypertension and dyslipidemia significantly facilitated the risk of IS. In addition, this study screened the following optimal models to predict the risk of CAD or IS by the GMDR method and binary logistic regression. The interactions of rs3130685-rs2222896-rs2278075, rs3130685-rs2222896-diabetes, and rs3130685-rs2222896-drinking increased the risk of CAD, whereas those of I5-I6-drinking decreased the risk of CAD. The rs3130685-rs2278075-rs2222896 and rs2710642-rs2278075-hypertension interactions strengthened the risk of IS, while H1-H2-drinking and I1-I3-I4-I5 interactions weakened the risk of IS. Many studies have reported that minimal or moderate drinking (\u22641 drink/day for women, \u2264 1-2 drink/day for men) is beneficial to protect arteries (Saez et al., 2010; Simino et al., 2013; Sferra et al., 2020) . A small amount of red wine before or during dinner could improve the prognosis of CVD (Stanhewicz et al., 2018) . The results might be attributed to the fact that grapes are rich in resveratrol, which reduces glutathione peroxidase and serum IL6 levels and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities (Stewart et al., 2019) . In this study, drinking and minimal drinking reduced the risk of IS and antagonized the effects of H1 and H2 to reduce IS risk. The explanation might be that the daily alcohol consumption of the subjects in the CAD and IS groups was generally low, or the alcohol content was relatively low. Moreover, this study observed that there was a redundancy effect of the drinking and I6 and I5 interaction in which the drinking factor played a dominant protective FIGURE 4 | Optimal interactions affecting diseases shown in a dendrogram. Elements that interact strongly with each other appear close together in the leaves of the tree, while elements that interact weakly appear far from each other. The yellow, orange and red colors indicate synergy effect between two factors, and blue and green colors indicate redundancy effect between two factors. The darker the color, the stronger the effect. effect; thus, the coeffect of I5-I6-drinking reduced the risk of CAD. However, the coeffect of rs3130685-rs2222896-drinking increased CAD risk, here, the mutation of genes was the dominant factor for increasing risk of CAD. Smoking is an independent risk factor for accelerating atherosclerosis (Taskinen and Bor\u00e9n, 2015; Voigt et al., 2020) . However, in this study, it showed that minimal smoking independently reduced the risk of IS, and the synergy of minimal smoking with haplotype H1 significantly reduced the risk of IS. Also, minimal smoking also antagonized the risk of IS caused by carrying the haplotype H2. This may be because minimal smoking reduced the psychological pressure of some patients, changing the risk of IS. Also, other protective factors overlapped with minimal smoking, which could mask its adverse effects. It may also be because there were too few subjects with minimal smoking in the IS group, leading to bias in this result. Therefore, a larger sample is needed to replicate the assessment to evaluate the accuracy of this result. Certainly, we have hardly found that minimal smoking has a similar effect on CAD. Hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia are independent and traditional risk factors for CVD and cerebrovascular disease (Willer et al., 2013; Wood et al., 2018) . Clinical studies have found that with a lower level of normal blood pressure at baseline, hypertension will increase the risk of CAD and IS to a greater extent (Yamada et al., 2019) . This study observed that diabetes enhanced the synergistic effect of the rs3130685-rs2222896 interaction, increasing the risk of CAD, and hypertension enhanced the synergistic effect of the rs2710642-rs2278075 interaction, increasing the risk of IS. These results suggest that the interaction of G \u00d7 E was the risk of CAD and IS. To improve prognosis, intervention for these patients should be individualized, starting with environmental factors or treatments targeting lipid-related genes and their pathways.",

            "text": "Caucasian participants (Joseph et al., 2017) , and another GWAS reported that smokers carrying WWOX were related to coronary artery calcification (Li et al., 2016) . These can be explained by the function of WWOX in regulating lipoprotein metabolism and lipid homeostasis. In addition, carrying the rs2278075T and rs2710642G alleles were associated with increased risks of IS, while carrying the rs3130685T allele was associated with a reduced risk of IS. We speculate that the rs2278075, rs2710642, and rs3130685 SNPs played a role in regulating blood lipid profiles to change risk of IS. Furthermore, study on the synergistic effects of these SNPs showed that the rs2710642A-rs10496099C-rs3132584G-rs3130685C-rs2222896A-rs2278075A interaction was associated with an increased risk of CAD, and the rs2710642A-rs10496099C-rs3132584G-rs3130685T-rs2222896A-rs2278075A and rs2710642A-rs10496099C-rs3132584G-rs3130685T-rs2222896G-rs2278075A interactions reduced and increased the risk of CAD and IS, respectively. The rs2710642A-rs10496099C-rs3132584G-rs3130685C-rs2222896G-rs2278075A and rs2710642G-rs10496099T-rs3132584C-rs3130685C-rs2222896G-rs2278075A interactions were associated with a reduced risk of CAD, and the rs2710642G-rs10496099T-rs3132584T-rs3130685T-rs2222896G-rs2278075T interaction was associated with an increased risk of CAD. The rs2710642G-rs10496099T-rs3132584G-rs3130685C-rs2222896G-rs2278075A and rs2710642G-rs10496099T-rs3132584G-rs3130685T-rs2222896G-rs2278075A interactions were associated with reduced and increased IS risk, respectively. Many studies have identified that haplotypes have a more significant impact on phenotype than a single SNP , and the association between haplotypes and phenotypes is more helpful for understanding local ancestral genome information and population genetic structure (Locke et al., 2015) . There was strong LD (D' > 0.8 or R 2 > 0.5) between the EHBP1 rs2710642 and rs10496099 SNPs in the three groups. We found that the rs2710642A-rs10496099C haplotype reduced the risk of IS by 0.7 times, and rs2710642G-rs10496099C haplotype increased the risk of IS by 2.94 times. These results indicate that either coeffects or haplotypes of SNPs have a better predictive effect than any single SNP in the disease risk model of CAD or IS.Previous studies reported that the rs2710642A and rs3130685T alleles were associated with LDL-C in European, Japanese and the Maonan population in China, and the rs2278075T allele was correlated with CAD in Caucasian (Kathiresan et al., 2007; Giagtzoglou et al., 2013; Joseph et al., 2017) . This study observed that in the control group, high levels of TC and TG were associated with the rs2710642G and rs3130685T alleles, and high levels of LDL-C were associated with the rs2710642G allele. However, low levels of HDL-C were associated with rs2278075T allele. These findings suggest that the association of rs2710642, rs3130685 and rs2278075 SNPs with CAD and IS may be achieved by altering blood lipid levels. According to information from the International 1,000 Genomes database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/variation/ tools/1000genomes/), the genotypic frequencies and MAFs of the SNPs in Han Chinese individuals in Beijing, China (CHB) were as follows: rs2278075AA 68.3%, AT 19.5%, TT 12.2%, and T 22.0%; rs2710642AA 36.6%, AG 56.1%, GG 7.3% and G 35.4%; and rs3130685CC 20.0%, CT 51.1%, TT 28.9%, and C 45.6%. It exhibited that the mutations and minor alleles of these SNPs were similar between the CHB and Guangxi Han population. I2, rs2710642A-rs10496099C-rs3132584G-rs3130685C-rs2222896G-rs2278075A; I5, rs2710642G-rs10496099T-rs3132584C-rs3130685C-rs2222896G-rs2278075A; I6, rs2710642G-rs10496099T-rs3132584T-rs313068T5-rs2222896G-rs2278075T; OR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval. Different types of interactions were analyzed by logistic regression. p < 0.001 indicates a statistically significant difference after Bonferroni correction and adjusting for six SNPs and seven confound factors.",
