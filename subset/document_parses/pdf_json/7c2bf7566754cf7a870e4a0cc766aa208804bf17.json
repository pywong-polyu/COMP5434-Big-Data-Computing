Globally, as of 30 August 2020, there have been 24 822 800 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 838 360 deaths, reported to WHO. 1 2 In a bid to stop the virus from spreading, there has been a global restriction on several activities including travelling. 3 4 The economic impact of a global shutdown and pressure on frail health systems of many countries across the world presents great uncertainty for the remaining half of the year and the immediate future.",

However, due to the sudden increase in demand for health personnel, test kits, emergency care equipment and personal protective equipment, the health systems of all affected countries have been put under significant strain. With varying efficacy, the affected countries have increased hospital facilities for critical cases, increased the daily number of tests to identify positive cases and increased provision of personal protective equipment for health personnel. 4 5 At present, in comparison with the USA and Europe, Africa has a lower number of cases and lower daily increase in infection.

This is because, from the perspective of capacity, African countries are in a parlous situation relative to Europe, North America and some parts of Asia. The health systems of many African countries have limited ability to roll out widespread community screening and testing, few health personnel and limited emergency facilities to manage critically ill patients with COVID-19. 6 The easing of restrictions on social and economic activities is likely to lead to a second wave of cases of COVID-19 in African countries. So with the best will and effort, African countries cannot use the same methodology to respond and contain the pandemic to the level of the developed countries that have performed badly, let alone to that of those that have performed well. If they are to use their limited capacity efficiently, it is imperative African countries clearly identify factors that will support that objective and institute effective evidencebased approaches to managing COVID-19. Accordingly, in a bid to support focus on efficient capacity development, this study analyses the relationship between health indicators and COVID-19 deaths and cases in African countries. While the indicators were drawn from different thematic areas, our analysis was largely data driven. We conducted analysis for sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries-the standard multilateral institutions data classification of Africa and also for all the countries on the continent including those north of the Sahara, usually classified with the Middle East region. We present our analysis by SSA countries due to their higher burden of disease and all of Africa.",

Major gaps still exist in the implementation of the WHO International Health Regulations, notably increasing capacity of hospitals and appropriate injection of financial resources. 17 The results confirm the point made earlier that unlike the other COVID-19 affected parts of the world, Africa has less capacity to handle a major outbreak of COVID-19. Therefore, African governments need to strengthen the overall healthcare systems, and in doing so, specific focus needs to be placed on enhancing human resource capacity such as nurses, medical doctors and laboratory personnel.",

Testing is a critical requirement for effective management of COVID-19. From a statistical perspective, testing identifies cases that may be managed before getting severe resulting in deaths. This increases the number of observations on deaths. This view is similar to that reported in a previous paper on the vulnerability of African countries to COVID-19 and their preparedness to mitigate. 18 More intuitively, we find that insufficient physical activity among adults aged 18+ years increased the risk of COVID-19 mortality. It is well documented in the literature that the lack of physical activity increases the risk of obesity. 19 Recent publications on COVID-19 related mortality have shown that obesity elevates the risk of mortality. 20 21 Physical inactivity has long been recognised as a risk factor for non-communicable diseases, which is a known cause of mortality globally. 22 23 Early studies since the onset of the COVID-19 outbreak in China indicated elderly patients and those with comorbidities particularly diabetes, hypertension and chronic respiratory diseases were at increased risk of mortality from COVID-19. 24 25 Therefore, the finding of insufficient physical activity as a risk factor for death from our study is consistent with earlier studies (1). 23 Similarly, immunisation has proved effective in prevention of different types of infectious diseases globally while breast feeding provides babies with essential nutrients and antibodies to help prevent infections early in life. Hence, establishment of expanded programme on immunisation and programmes to encourage breast feeding globally. Thus, we postulate that the population of Africans aged 18+ years who do not undertake sufficient physical activity may be similarly at high risk of mortality.",
