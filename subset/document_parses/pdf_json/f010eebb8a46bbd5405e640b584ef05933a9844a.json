            "text": "Following up large numbers of candidates in continuous gravitational wave searches presents a challenge, particularly in regard to computational power and the time required to manually scrutinize each of the candidates. It is important to design and test good follow-up procedures that are safe (i.e., minimize false dismissals) and computationally efficient across many search configurations. We investigate two existing follow-up procedures, or \"vetoes\", both of which exploit the Doppler modulation predicted in astrophysical signals. We take advantage of a well-established semicoherent search algorithm based on a hidden Markov model to study a wide variety of search configurations and to generalize the veto criteria by considering the overall veto performance in terms of efficiency and safety. The results can serve as a guideline for follow-up studies in future continuous gravitational wave searches using a hidden Markov model algorithm. The results also apply qualitatively to other semicoherent search algorithms.",

            "text": "Gravitational waves (GWs), perturbations in spacetime which propagate at the speed of light, were first directly observed in 2015 when the Hanford and Livingston detectors of the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO) detected a merging binary black hole system (GW150914) [1, 2] . In the years since the first detection, the addition of Advanced Virgo [3] and KAGRA [4] to the network of observatories, together with improved sensitivity, has produced increasingly frequent detections of compact binary coalescences (CBCs) [5] [6] [7] . Other types of GW sources that are predicted to radiate at frequencies within the observational band of ground-based detectors remain undetected, e.g., the continuous gravitational waves (CWs) produced by spinning neutron stars. CWs, once detected, will provide invaluable information regarding the structure of neutron stars as well as the nuclear equation of state [8] . A great deal of work has been carried out to develop methods to search for CWs [9] [10] [11] .",

In addition, intrinsic, stochastic wandering of the frequency, sometimes called \"timing noise\" in the context of radio pulsars, could de-grade the sensitivity of a CW search [12, 13] . In this paper we focus on a computationally efficient, semicoherent search strategy based on a hidden Markov model (HMM) which is equipped to track a signal frequency that wanders stochastically and spins down secularly [14, 15] . The tracking scheme has its origins in engineering applications, and has recently been used in many directed CW searches (e.g., [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] ).",

This optimal signal evolution, referred to as the Viterbi path, consists of a frequency estimated at each discrete time step. The search over the full frequency band is usually parallelized and carried out in narrow sub-bands (with width of \u223c 1 Hz). The Viterbi path obtained in each sub-band, corresponding to the most likely CW candidate in that sub-band, is assigned a Viterbi score. This score evaluates the candidate significance, such that a higher score signifies a greater probability that the candidate is inconsistent with random noise fluctuations [14, 16] . For the mathematical details behind these procedures, see Secs. II A-D in Ref. [21] . Some searches rely on an unnormalized log-likelihood instead of the Viterbi score to evaluate the significance of a candidate [19, [22] [23] [24] [25] .",

A directed search targets an astrophysical source at a known sky position with unknown ephemerides and hence is conducted over a wide frequency band (e.g., \u223c 20-1000 Hz). A typical directed search will produce on the order of 10 3 CW candidates, many of which will require the use of multiple verification techniques to be identified as noise. As such, a computationally efficient follow-up procedure is needed in order to comb through the results and distinguish the candidates caused by noise artifacts from any real astrophysical signal.",

The known-line veto involves eliminating every candidate whose frequency evolution overlaps any known instrumental line present in any of the detectors [27, 28] . The single interferometer veto involves eliminating unidentified instrumental artifacts by checking if a candidate is significantly louder (i.e., if it has a larger Viterbi score) in one detector than in the other. After this, most searches use two additional well-defined vetoes to further identify noise artifacts, also described in Refs. [16, [21] [22] [23] . The total observing time can be split into multiple subintervals, and any candidates that are significantly louder in one particular subinterval are eliminated. Then, if the estimated frequency evolution rate is sufficiently low, the coherent time, T coh , over which the data are integrated coherently can be increased and any candidate whose Viterbi score decreases when T coh increases can be vetoed.",

Two additional veto strategies, both based on Doppler modulation (DM), have been developed for the candidate follow-up procedure [19, 29] . They prove to be both useful and complementary to each other, in that one often vetoes the candidates that the other does not. However, these procedures are quite dependent on the search configuration used in a particular study. For the first of these two strategies, called the DM-off veto, the signal significance is calculated with the DM correction for the Doppler shift due to Earth's motion switched on and off. The candidates that are louder when the DM correction is switched off are not likely to be of astrophysical origin. For the second strategy, called the off-target veto, the search is shifted to a sky position away from the true position of the target, i.e., a shifted DM correction is applied. If the candidates become louder, they are vetoed. Despite the wide applications of these two vetoes in existing searches [21] [22] [23] [24] , the general safety (i.e., no astrophysical signal is falsely eliminated) of these veto procedures is still being studied for various search configurations, e.g., for HMM-based searches.",

The impact from the imperfect removal of the binary orbital modulation is out of the scope of this paper. While this study is carried out using an HMM-based method, in principle the resulting guidelines broadly apply to stack-slide-based semicoherent algorithms [30] (but rigorous studies using other algorithms is out of the scope of this paper).

In particular, for any series of markers that lie along the same \u03ba contour in panel (a), the \u2206-curves that correspond to these markers will all intersect at the particular time used to calculate \u03ba in (a). This is because the DM for sources at sky positions along a single contour are the same for this particular time. For instance, the \u2206-curves for four locations along the contour where \u03ba = 0 are shown in panel (b), marked by red dots, light pink stars, green diamonds, and purple plus signs. The \u2206 value evolves over time in different ways depending on the sky position, so although the \u2206-curves all intersect at the start time, they no longer overlap as time shifts forward. While the dot and star markers are near the equator and experience strong DM effects, the diamond and plus sign markers are near the poles and are only weakly impacted by the DM. Examples of \u2206-curves for locations with a range of other \u03ba values are displayed in panel (c).",

That is, for all sky positions along a \u03ba contour, despite being off-target from the true position, the DM effect is the same as that seen at the true position for a given instant time. As the integration time is increased, most of these similarities tend to disappear as the Doppler correction at each sky position evolves differently. However, the DM effects integrated over time for sky positions that lie along certain directions could still mimic each other, especially for sky positions that have similar \u03ba values over the integration time. Therefore, when correcting the DM with a slightly incorrect sky position along some particular direction(s), which is the Table II. basis for the off-target veto, the recovered signal at the offset position could mimic the signal from the true sky position and produce similar detection statistics in a CW search. Indeed, if one searches a grid of locations around the true position of the source, the detection statistic for an elliptical area around the true sky position is higher than other sky regions. This behavior is discussed in detail in Section V.",

Second, we use an HMM tracking scheme to discover the most probable frequency evolution over the full observing time. These two procedures are briefly reviewed in Sections III A and III B, respectively. The detection statistic used in this study, known as the Viterbi score, is outlined in Section III C.

Then, the DM effect acts as an interesting basis for vetoes; it provides a useful way to study the difference between signals, whose intrinsic frequencies can only be recovered with the DM correction, and noise artifacts, whose frequencies are not impacted by the DM (since they originate on Earth).",

In a Viterbi search, the DM correction is switched off within the F-statistic calculation. When the DM correction is switched off, the Viterbi score of a signal of astrophysical origin should drop below the threshold S th and a different Viterbi path should be returned. A candidate resulting from a noise artifact, on the other hand, should yield a higher score (except in the rare case that a noise line wanders in a way that mimics the DM) and a Viterbi path that overlaps with the original. As such, a candidate is vetoed only if the Viterbi score increases when the DM correction is switched off and an overlapping Viterbi path is returned. In Ref.

We note that in both Figures 2 and 3 , one false alarm in the DM-off run (with S DM\u2212off \u2248 6.5 and 7.0, respectively) does have an increased score relative to S DM\u2212on that is above threshold (with a different Viterbi path), but in fact the injected signal is too weak to be identified as a candidate in the first place (i.e., S DM\u2212on < S th ). According to these simulation results, one can even safely veto a candidate if the score remains above S th and the same Viterbi path is returned in the DM-off search, as long as the candidate is not in the high SNR shaded region. (In practice, with the current detector sensitivity, candidates found in a real search with Viterbi scores S > 27 (T coh = 12 hr) and S > 200 (T coh = 5 d) are caused by noise artifacts and would most likely be eliminated by another CW veto.) However, comparing S DM\u2212off to S DM\u2212on rather than the threshold is generally a more conservative option, i.e., to be cautious, we keep the candidates with S DM\u2212on > S DM\u2212off > S th for further scrutiny. In particular, setting veto criteria by comparing S DM\u2212off to S DM\u2212on rather than S th ensures the veto safety for sources with sky positions close to the ecliptic poles, since the DM correction at these positions would be minimal and so switching off DM correction would not have much impact on the significance of the Viterbi score. Still, even for these sky positions, we would not expect the Viterbi score to increase when switching the DM correction off. Thus, based on the criteria we have defined, these candidates would not be vetoed and the DM-off veto remains safe.",

There are nine candidates caused by noise lines that fall below the dashed line that do have overlapping frequency paths, marked with red circles. These artifacts are inspected individually. Two possibilities are as follows: (i) the noise lines wander in a way that mimics the Doppler modulation in an astrophysical signal; or (ii) when we integrate data from both detectors and switch off the DM correction, the noise artifact at the candidate frequency remains the most significant, but the likelihoods in other frequency bins happen to increase, decreasing the relative significance of the original artifact. In a real search, these candidates would not be eliminated by the DM-off veto because they do not satisfy the veto criteria, so they would be followed up using other methods.

Two signal strengths are studied: a weak signal with h 0 = 4.0 \u00d7 10 \u221226 and a loud one with h 0 = 8.0 \u00d7 10 \u221226 . The detector ASD is set to S 1/2 h = 4 \u00d7 10 \u221224 Hz \u22121/2 . We assume the signals are circularly polarized with cos \u03b9 fixed at unity such that h eff 0 /h 0 is held fixed, where h eff 0 is defined in Eq. (33) in Ref. [14] . The simulation is run over 180 d, starting from the GPS time 1167545066 (arbitrarily chosen; same as the one used in the DM-off studies and in Figure 1 (a) ). Three search configurations are tested in order to get a more complete picture of how a signal behaves around its center position in the sky: T coh = 12 hr (N T = 360), T coh = 5 d (N T = 36), and T coh = 30 d (N T = 6). The spacing and total span of the offset grid vary depending on the search configuration used; the offset grid ranges from 31 \u00d7 21 (finest) to 21 \u00d7 15 (coarsest) data points, the latter used to save on computational time. Figure 6 shows the Viterbi scores (plotted as the color) of the recovered signal at its injected sky position (RA = 00 h 00 m 00 s, Dec = 00 \u2022 00 00 ) and for a grid of offsets around that position. The left and right columns correspond to the low and high SNR scenarios, respectively. The three rows, from top to bottom, correspond to T coh = 12 hr, 5 d, and 30 d. The bright ellipse (with the brightest spot in the center) shown in these plots, which we refer to as the effective point spread function (EPSF), is exactly what one would expect for an astrophysical signal in any stack-slide-based semicoherent search algorithm. Moreover, such patterns are consistent with those in existing literature: e.g., see Fig. 1 in Ref. [39] , Fig. 1 in Ref. [33] , and Fig. 14 in Ref. [40] . The ellipse in part comes about because of the different dependencies in RA versus Dec, outlined in Ref. [33] . The faint periodic features seen in some plots but not in others may be related to the periodic functions within the \u03ba term in Eq. (8) [32] . However, we rely only on the broader elliptical patterns in this study, so the minor features do not impact the results. A more detailed investigation of these minor features lies outside the scope of this paper. It should be noted that the ellipses shown in panels (a) and (b), both with T coh = 12 hr, appear to be slightly off-center such that the brightest point is not exactly at the injection site. This is most likely due to the relatively poor sky resolution when a short T coh < 1 d is used. Indeed, the peak is recovered almost exactly at the injection location for T coh = 5 d and 30 d.",

In fact, it has already been established that the offset at which the detection statistic drops below threshold is related to T coh ; as T coh increases, this offset decreases [39] . This relationship is shown in Figure 7 ; the offset in Dec (holding RA fixed at the injection coordinate) at which the Viterbi score drops below 0.5S target is tracked as a function of T coh . (To quantify this relation with better resolution, we conduct additional searches with two more coherent lengths T coh = 1 d and 10 d in Dec.) Indeed, for both SNRs tested, the shortest coherent time, 12 hr, has the greatest Dec offset. As we increase T coh , this offset decreases approximately linearly in log-log scale. We choose to take our offsets only in Dec because the behavior of the detection statistics is more dependent on the source position when moving only in RA, so taking offsets in Dec allows us to set more generally applicable guidelines for the veto that are independent of sky position.

Once a large enough offset is reached, the score drops below threshold and the signal is no longer detectable. This offset at which the signal becomes undetectable heavily depends on T coh and SNR. For extremely loud signals, the detection statistic may never drop below threshold, regardless of the sky position searched. However, current detectors do not operate in the high-SNR regime for CW sources-in fact, such a loud signal would be astrophysically implausible because the source would likely fall outside the range of extreme ellipticities and would be spinning down so rapidly that it\u1e61 f -value would not lie within the ranges used in this study.

The other simulation parameters are the same as those in Section V A. Figure 9 shows the resulting contour plots, where the Viterbi score (color) is plotted as a function of RA and Dec for a grid of offsets centered on the injection site; see Table II for the ten injection locations and their corresponding scores. Random variations aside, the shape and orientation of the EPSF change systematically as functions of RA and Dec. Matching up each panel in Figure 9 to its position in Figure 1 (a), we observe that the inclination of the ellipse at a particular sky position roughly follows the slope of the \u03ba contour in Figure 1 (a) passing through that same position. Two notable examples are discussed below. The first is presented in Figure 9 (h); this image is centered on RA = 01 h 00 m 00 s and Dec = 88 \u2022 00 00 , and it shows an ellipse that spans more than two hours in RA-a significant fraction of the sky. Referring to where this position is found within the contour map in Figure 1 (a)-the triangle marker pointing towards the left-we immediately notice that the contour passing through this point moves along RA at a roughly fixed Dec. The same holds true for a source found at, for example, Dec = \u221288 \u2022 00 00 . Indeed, as the position approaches either pole, the EPSF extends broadly along RA because the DM effect is weak near the poles. This fact could lead to astrophysical signals being falsely vetoed as noise if the off-target veto is applied to sources near the poles using an offset only in RA. Certainly, choosing our criteria so that the off-target veto can be safely applied to candidates at the poles is important since it is unlikely that the DM-off veto will eliminate such candidates.",

As the start time is shifted forward, the Doppler pattern in Figure 1 (a) also shifts across the sky. The EPSF becomes less extended as the observing time increases, because the bright and dark regions from different instants in time are included in the integration and cancel out.

First, in the follow-up procedure of either a directed search which is targeting many sources at different sky positions (e.g., [23, 24] ) or an all-sky CW search, if the earlier-stage vetoes are not effective enough, we need to use the off-target veto to process a large number of CW candidates from many sky positions. Thus, both safety and efficiency are important. Creating and inspecting detailed images of the EPSF for every candidate would be computationally expensive. Rather, this study allows us to use the detection statistic at a single Dec offset (as offsets in Dec have been shown in Sec. V B to be safer than offsets in RA) to decide whether or not to veto a candidate. Moreover, we choose a conservative offset such that it is valid for all sky positions; however, the choice of offset does depend on the T coh and T obs used in a particular search.",

            "text": "We propose the following broad criteria for applying the off-target veto to many candidates at once: a candidate can be safely vetoed only if the score at a certain conservative Dec offset remains above 0.5S target or S th (whichever is larger), with the added condition that the recovered Viterbi path at this offset position must overlap the original path. In practice, one can choose a different fraction other than 0.5 as needed, based on empirical studies. The reason we stipulate a fraction of the original score rather than a particular value of the score is so that, for a relatively loud signal with original score S > 2S th , the dependence on the SNR is generally removed (as demonstrated in Figure 7 ). If such an astrophysical signal exists, the score should drop at least 50% by the chosen Dec offset. We keep any candidate whose score is below S th at this offset position because a weak signal becomes undetectable at very small offsets from the true sky position. One could even consider setting the offset based on a more sophisticated parameter-space-based distance, as presented in Ref. [41] , but such a detailed study is beyond the scope of this paper. Figure 10 shows an example of how one might find this optimal offset position for the three T coh choices used most frequently in this paper. When processing many candidates at once, a plot like those along the bottom row of Fig. 10 can be created using a synthetic signal injected into Gaussian noise. To obtain a safe offset that can be applied to candidates from various sky positions, we carry out the simulations at the sky position where the detection statistic varies the slowest in Dec (i.e., the position at which the EPSF will be the most extended in Dec). The offset for applying the off-target veto can then be determined by looking at where the score drops below 0.5S target for a relatively loud signal such that 0.5S target > S th . For our particular search configuration, using the data presented in Fig. 10 , we find this offset for T coh = 12 hr, 5 d, and 30 d (for a total observing time of 180 d) to be 7 \u2022 , 3 \u2022 , and 1 \u2022 , respectively. It should be noted for T coh = 12 hr that, despite the EPSF being significantly off-center, as often occurs for short coherent times which have poorer resolution, the veto can still be safely applied as long as a conservative offset is chosen using the results from simulations in Gaussian noise.",

The search configuration should remain unchanged when creating both images (i.e., observation start time, T coh , and total observing time should all be the same), and the signal strength of the injection should be chosen such that the recovered signal at the center has roughly the same S target as the CW candidate.

We use a combination of the coherent F-statistic and an HMM scheme to track the signal, and we take the Viterbi score as our primary detection statistic.",

Although the veto is not able to eliminate every noise line, the majority are successfully eliminated. More importantly, no synthetic signals are falsely eliminated in any configuration. Furthermore, we show that the off-target veto can be used in two different ways to follow up CW candidates depending on how many remain to be investigated. If many candidates from various sky positions need to be processed at once, a single Dec offset which is safe for all sky positions can be chosen such that if the Viterbi score at this offset remains above 50% of the original score and above S th , and the recovered Viterbi path overlaps the original candidate path, the candidate is vetoed. On the other hand, if only a few candidates require follow-up, a more detailed investigation can be carried out by calculating and comparing the EPSFs around the candidate location using both injections in Gaussian noise and the real data. A candidate is vetoed if these two patterns do not generally agree. Thus, the EPSF is used as a precise marker of an astrophysical signal, expanding the applicability of the off-target veto.",

As a result, we expect to see searches produce more CW candidates (because the data are more likely to be polluted by weak noise artifacts), and these candidates will become more timeconsuming to verify or veto. This study verifies the safety of the DM-off and off-target vetoes and proposes a refined veto procedure in preparation for future CW searches and the first CW detection.",

Bottom row: Viterbi score S (as a fraction of Starget) obtained at positions away from the center along Dec. In each panel, the search configuration is the same as that used in the contour image above it (from left to right: T coh = 12 hr, 5 d, 30 d). The solid lines mark the threshold for each search configuration displayed as a fraction of Starget. The dashed cyan line in each contour image in the top row marks the direction along which the series of offsets shown in the bottom row are taken.",
