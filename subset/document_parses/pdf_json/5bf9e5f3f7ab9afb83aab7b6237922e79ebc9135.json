In 2016, Shigella was estimated to cause > 250 million cases and > 200,000 deaths globally [2] . Higher income countries experience Shigella infections among travelers, aging populations, deployed military personnel, and men who have sex with men (MSM) [2, 3] . However, the preponderance of the Shigella disease burden is in children aged under 5 years residing in low-middle income countries (LMICs). Infection in this vulnerable group can also result in significant long-term consequences such as severe stunting and impaired cognitive development [2, 4] . The global epidemiology of Shigella is worsened by the emergence and spread of multi-and extensively drug resistant (MDR and XDR) variants, making infections increasingly difficult to treat [5] . The principal method of Shigella prevention has been improvements in water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) [6] . However, due to the low infectious dose, the standard of WASH required to break transmission is difficult to attain in many LMICs [7] . Furthermore, recent application of molecular techniques to identify Shigella infections found a severe underestimation of the global Shigella burden [8, 9] , highlighting the need for new low-cost prevention techniques.",

However, studies in animals and controlled human infection models (CHIMs) have shown that protection through immunization is feasible [11, 12] . Natural disease epidemiology in humans and non-human primate infection studies show complete protection from re-infection with a homologous Shigella species. Long-term homologous protection has been attributed to serotype-specific systemic (serum IgG) and mucosal (IgA) antibody responses [12, 13] . The most immunodominant target of the Shigella IgG and IgA response is the O-antigen component of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) [14, 15] . LPS/ O-antigen-specific antibodies elicit protection through antibody-mediated opsonization, phagocytosis, and intracellular cytotoxicity [13] . However, antibodies against Shigella O-antigen are highly specific for the infecting species only [11, 13] , and do not provide protection against heterologous Shigella species. Since the Shigella genus consists of four species and > 50 serotypes, a lack of cross-protection against heterologous species and serotypes poses a major challenge for vaccine development [16] . This challenge may be overcome by a vaccine that elicits either a broadly reactive immune response or numerous species-specific responses against the globally dominant Shigella species (i.e., S. flexneri and S. sonnei) [17] .",

Multivalent killed-vaccines also induce high titers of serum IgG and mucosal IgA targeting Shigella O-antigens and have shown protection in early clinical development [22, 23] . Recombinant forms of Shigella O-antigen have also been pursued as vaccine candidates [10] , with a Shigella O-antigen conjugated to a carrier protein [24] [25] [26] , which engages T cell help and produces a longer lasting antibody response to the polysaccharide antigen [27] . Various immunogenic proteins, such as the toxins from other pathogens, have been used as carrier proteins [28, 29] . However, protein antigens from Shigella have not been evaluated as a carrier protein for Shigella O-antigen.",

Here, we aimed to identify novel immunogenic Shigella antigens that could serve as Shigella vaccine candidates, either alone, or when conjugated to Shigella O-antigen. Therefore, we conducted immunogen prediction using bioinformatic analysis, then created a protein microarray of predicted immunogenic Shigella antigens. These expressed antigens were screened for immunogenicity using polyclonal antibodies from patients who recovered from confirmed Shigella infections, to identify a novel set of proteins which may facilitate the development of novel Shigella vaccines.",

Bactericidal activity was calculated as a ratio of CFU at T90 over T0, from which SBA titers were estimated at 50% bactericidal activity. Convalescent immune serum from a confirmed Shigellainfected patient was used as a positive control [38] . All serum samples were tested in triplicate and the SBA titers averaged. The SBA assays with S. sonnei DE 1404 were performed with and without the supplementation of 10 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol. S. sonnei has the propensity to lose the virulence plasmid and O-antigen culture during culture, and the addition of 10 \u03bcg/ml chloramphenicol was to ensure the maintenance of plasmid and O-antigen during the SBA assay via the added cat gene. These data were compared to assess potential killing differences between plasmid+ and plasmid\u2212 organisms.",

The analysis identified 22 S. flexneri-specific, 8 S. sonnei-specific, and 2 Shigellaspecific proteins (IpaH3.1, IpaH4.5). Another 100 potentially immunogenic orthologs, from both S. sonnei and S. flexneri, were further included to expand the downstream immunogenic assays.

We compared the IgG sero-reactivity at birth (cord blood serum) between infants from mothers with high (n = 45) and low (n = 40) antibody titers (to Shigella O-antigen) (Fig. 3) . In general, infants from mothers with high antibody titers demonstrated greater IgG seroreactivity against tested Shigella antigens in comparison to infants born to mothers with low IgG titers (Fig. 3) .

A BacPowerTM E. coli protein expression system was used to express SF_nmpC, SF_fepA, and SSON_htrB, SSON_emrK, SSON_nlpB, SSON_fhuA, SSON_cjrA, SSON_mdtA, SSON_sbmA, SSON_mviN, SSON_pldA, and SSON_3803. We were unsuccessful in expressing SSON_sbmA, SSON_mviN, SSON_3803, and SSON_pldA using this system (Additional File 6 Table S4 ). Therefore, we proceeded to test the remaining eight antigens (i.e., SF_nmpC, SF_fepA, and SSON_htrB, SSON_emrK, SSON_nlpB, SSON_fhuA, SSON_cjrA, and SSON_mdtA) in rabbits to ensure they could induce an antibody response when immunized as recombinant antigens. Rabbits were immunized separately with the eight antigens, and the serum was screened to measure binding IgG antibodies. All eight of the purified antigens induced robust IgG responses in vivo, which was Fig. 3 Reactivity of cord blood from mothers with high or low IgG titers to Shigella antigens. a, b IgG reactivity of cord blood to all tested Shigella antigens. In the heat maps, Shigella antigens were ordered from bottom to top by increasing average IgG reactivity and cord blood samples were ordered from left to right by increasing average IgG reactivity. c IgG reactivity to the top twelve highly reactive Shigella antigens was compared between cord blood from high and low IgG titer mothers using the Benjamini-Hochberg corrected Cyber-T test (p values represented in gray dropdown pin heads). Error bars (black) represent 95% confidence interval around the mean. The red dashed horizontal line is at p value = 0.05 detectable by immunoblot and ELISA (Fig. 4) . We next tested the immunized rabbit sera for the potential to induce bacterial killing in an antibody-dependent complementmediated serum bactericidal assay. We measured the killing potential of the purified rabbit serum against S. flexneri, S. sonnei, and Salmonella Typhimurium to ensure that the serum bactericidal activity (SBA) induced by the immunized antigens was Shigella specific. The SBA assay was unable to detect bactericidal activity below 50 \u03bcg/ml against S. sonnei (Table 1 and Additional File 10 Table S5) whether grown with or without chloramphenicol, which was used to maintain the virulence plasmid and O-antigen cluster in S. Sonnei due to the plasmid containing a cat resistance gene. However, six of the eight Shigella immunogens (i.e., SF_ fepA, SSON_cjrA, SSON_emrK, SSON_fhuA, SSON_ mdtA, and SSON_nlpB) induced antibody responses with strong serum bactericidal activity against S. flexneri (i.e., 50% SBA titer < 50 \u03bcg/ml) ( Table 1) ; the lowest 50% SBA titer was induced by the immunogen SSON_cjrA (Table 3 ). Our results show that the antigen SSON_cjrA was the most potent inducer of bactericidal antibodies against Shigella and the best antigen to take forward into future testing as a potential vaccine antigen.",

            "text": "In the current study, we exploited reverse vaccinology 2.0 to integrate both comparative genomics and human immuno-proteome analysis to identify novel immunogenic chromosomal Shigella proteins. Genomic comparison and bioinformatic analysis of 57 Shigella and E. coli genomes allowed us to narrow down to 235 predicted immunogenic antigens. The predicted antigens were then expressed and printed onto a microarray, probed with a panel of sera from Shigella-infected individuals, to narrow the selection to 12 highly sero-reactive antigens. We confirmed that antibody responses to these 12 antigens were similar across sex (i.e., males and females) and two age groups (i.e., < 2 years and > 2 years). Using cord blood samples, we additionally observed that IgG responses to 11 of these 12 antigens could be transmitted transplacentally, hence suggesting the possible application of these antigens as prenatal vaccine candidates. Among the 12 antigens, 8 were successfully expressed as recombinant proteins. Six of these antigens were both immunogenic in animal models and generated functionally protective antibody responses against Shigella. These were SF_fepA, SSON_cjrA, SSON_emrK, SSON_fhuA, SSON_mdtA, Fig. 4 Immunogenicity testing of selected Shigella proteins in vivo. Rabbits were immunized with top reactive Shigella proteins, fepA, nmpC, cjrA, emrK, fhuA, htrB, mdtA, and nlpB. Positive antibody responses to respective Shigella antigen or immunogen in the immunized rabbits were tested using a western blot and b ELISA Table 3 Immunization with highly reactive Shigella proteins elicits protective antibody responses. Rabbits were immunized with 0.2 mg of Shigella proteins, and sera (at 1 week post-immunization) were tested in vitro for serum bactericidal activity (SBA) against Shigella flexneri, Shigella sonnei, and Shigella Typhimurium. SBA titers presented below are estimated at 50% bactericidal activity and SSON_nlpB, with SSON_cjrA being the most immunogenic in terms of eliciting antibody-mediated bactericidal responses. Such bactericidal effects against S. sonnei were not observed in vitro, probably due to the protection against complement-mediated killing afforded by its high molecular weight capsule [55] . However, the immunogenicity of these antigens suggests that during S. sonnei infections, the capsule can be modulated to expose these functional proteins in vivo. This highlights the complex pathogenesis of S. sonnei and the difficulty in developing a suitable vaccine candidate. The biological functions of these six Shigella immunogenic proteins have been characterized previously. FepA and FhuA serve as outer membrane proteins which bind and transport siderophores (ferric enterobactin and ferrichrome, respectively) [56, 57] . CjrA shares substantial homology to Pseudomonas aeruginosa PhuW and potentially acts to sequester iron from heme, the most common iron source in mammals [58] . EmrK and MdtA are subunits of the multidrug efflux pump EmrKY and MdtABC, respectively [59, 60] , which contribute to resistance to bile salt and antimicrobials in E. coli. In addition, EmrKY has been shown to confer Shigella survival in infected macrophages, facilitating its invasive pathogenesis in the human host [59] . NlpB forms part of the outer membrane protein (OMP) assembly complex, which assembles and inserts beta-barrel proteins into the outer membrane [61, 62] . The immunogenicity of these proteins points to their potentially high expression during Shigella infections, concurring with the survival strategies of pathogenic bacteria. Particularly, within-host iron is key to bacterial replication, and the ability to sequester and transport host iron is pivotal to the pathogenesis of Klebsiella pneumoniae [63] and Staphylococcus aureus [64] .",

Five of these antigens (i.e., FepA, CjrA, EmrK, FhuA, MdtA, and NlpB) are conserved in pathogenic E. coli, but they have not been tested for immunogenicity following pathogenic E. coli infection either. However, the presence of the genetic cluster cjrABC-senB has been previously linked to uropathogenic E. coli [65] . The immunogenicity of these six proteins may be predictable, since they are either surface exposed outer membrane or periplasmic proteins. Outer membrane particles of Shigella (Generalized Modules of Membrane Antigens-GMMA) have historically been thought to be highly virulent and immunomodulatory and are currently being developed as a vaccine immunogen [66] . GMMA-based Shigella vaccine, 1790GAHB, was shown to be immunogenic in human clinical trials [67] . Immunogenicity of GMMA vesicles has been attributed to the presence of LPS. However, proteomic analysis of the GMMA detected FepA and FhuA [68] . Based on our findings, it is plausible that other Shigella antigens, such as those identified in our current study, are may be partly responsible for the immunogenic properties of GMMA.",

Fortunately, all the antigens, with the exception of CjrA, are conserved between S. flexneri and S. sonnei. Therefore, these antigens could be used to create a vaccine that protects against the two globally dominant Shigella species, which accounted for almost 90% of all Shigella cases in the Global Enteric Multicenter study (GEMS) [17] . Furthermore, in addition to strong IgG responses, all six antigens raised significant IgA responses, which is the dominant immunoglobulin at the mucosa. IgA-mediated protection has been explained by both preventing Shigella infection of host cells and downregulating inflammation and intestinal tissue pathology at infected sites [69, 70] . Although the current study measured IgA in serum, it has been previously shown that Shigella-specific serum IgA positively correlates with mucosal IgA in the stool [14] . Additionally, we observed that IgG specific to the six immunogenic Shigella antigens were capable of transplacental transfer, indicating that the antigens could additionally serve as prenatal vaccine candidates to protect neonates.",
