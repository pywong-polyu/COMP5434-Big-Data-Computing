However, the development of methodologies is more reliable the closer the collection is socioeconomically, demographically, and genetically to the population under study. The purpose of this study is to characterize and contextualize a new Portuguese reference collection. The collection of identified skeletons from the University of \u00c9vora comprises 201 adults of both sexes and seven non-adults, deceased between 1870 and 1993 and born between 1790 and 1969. It consists almost exclusively of individuals who were born and died in inland Alentejo, being the only Portuguese collection with this characteristic. The collection was built following all current legal and ethical obligations. Due to its characteristics, the collection constitutes a fundamental tool for forensic and bioarchaeological research in the inland regions of Portugal. In addition to the possibility offered to develop and validate methodologies in both sciences, the available complete hospital archives for research make this collection unique for health studies before, during, and after the epidemiological transition.",

Following this interest, the Laboratory of Biological Anthropology of the University of \u00c9vora (LABUE) was created in 1997. The LABUE has a crucial practical aspect also in the field, being responsible for numerous anthropological excavations in Alentejo. LABUE facilities store 39 osteological collections from archaeological excavations in the region. Analyzing the data from archaeological excavations in Portugal recorded in the national archaeological database Endov\u00e9lico, 1 we find that 43.4% (2292/5278) of all excavations in cemeteries, and other funerary structures, are in Alentejo. Curiously, this region represents only 24.7% of the total area of the Portuguese territory [19] . 2 It is well known that the methodologies applied in the study of past populations should be developed on identified individuals from samples as similar as possible to the people under study, particularly regarding styles and circumstances of life. This is important to reduce the biases due to geographical and temporal distances, which always exist in this type of collection [7] . The Portuguese osteological reference collections are composed of individuals who lived in urban areas in the central and northern coastal regions (Fig. 1) . Thus, the development of a reference collection in the rural and inland south of the territory is not only pertinent but highly important. The newly identified collection from \u00c9vora is the only one whose individuals lived almost exclusively in inland Alentejo.",

In Portugal, people can decide, in their lifetime, to enroll in the national registry of nondonors, thus making it impossible to use any organ (bones included) for any purpose after death [28] . The consultation with the National Register of Non-Donors allows excluding all the people who expressed this interest from the collection. (2) Next is verification, with the Institute of Legal Medicine, if the corpses were autopsied. According to Article 17 of Decree-Law 411/98 [29] , if one individual has been autopsied for legal reasons, the municipality will only assign the skeletons after judicial authorization. (3) Finally, [29] , the transportation of the skeletons from cemeteries to the Laboratory of Biological Anthropology will have to be done in cars suitable for the transport of corpses. The skeletons will be kept by the laboratory and returned or made available to the municipality if necessary or required.",
