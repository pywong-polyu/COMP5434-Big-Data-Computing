Through the implementation of a PEWS calculator embedded in the EHR, we hope to improve the accuracy of the recorded score and reduce the time between vital sign collection and final documentation in the EHR. Methods: Identification of the highest PEWS value in the 24 hours before all unplanned transfers or rapid response activations without a transfer occurred between the period November 1, 2013, through December 31, 2016. The accuracy of the calculated cardiac or respiratory subscore based on heart rate or the respiratory rate at the time of PEWS calculation was determined. We tracked the calculation of the time to chart via the difference between nursing documentation of PEWS compared to vital sign collection. Before September 3, 2015, PEWS was calculated mentally by the bedside nurse; afterward, the nurse entered the unique PEWS features into the EHR, and the EHR automatically calculated PEWS. Results: This study evaluated 2,409 PEWS scores, 1,411 before and 998 after initiation of the PEWS calculator. Accuracy before the EHR calculator was 71%, and the median time to document was 55 minutes. Following the implementation of the calculator, no scores were incorrectly calculated too low, and the median time to document was 20 minutes. Conclusions: Transition to an EHR-based PEWS calculator eliminated inaccurately low PEWS values and reduced time to document.",

Although the hospital deterioration committee noted the identification of the problem (inaccurate scores and delayed documentation), the creation and implementation followed Gephart's recommendations through the heavy involvement of the nursing staff on the creation of the automated calculator. This project has a significant impact on patient safety. By eliminating inaccurately low scores, missed mandatory activations are less likely, and by reducing the time to chart, identification of elevated scores occurs sooner. The combination of these effects ensures a quick and appropriate evaluation of patients in the early-to-late stages of deterioration, to identify the appropriate rescue plan. A possible tradeoff to this project is the loss of awareness of how to calculate the PEWS by the bedside nurse, and thus reduce his or her understanding of the score itself. A calculation table is included for reference in the current electronic form to maintain nursing awareness of the score. Additionally, during periods of EHR downtime, the bedside nurse may struggle to calculate PEWS. Automation of the score may also impact the understanding of how each PEWS subcomponent relates to deterioration again, highlighting the importance of using PEWS as an aid and not an absolute decision point.",

Before the implementation of the calculator, only information regarding the recorded heart rate, respiratory rate, and total subscore (cardiac, respiratory, or behavior) were available, rather than the nonvital sign components that might affect a subscore. As a result, if a score was higher than expected by the vital sign range, it was assumed that another feature (ie, poor perfusion for cardiac, or severe retractions in respiratory) resulted in the higher than expected score, and thus they were classified as \"accurate\" for our analysis. Whether or not the preimplementation documented vital signs were used by the bedside nurse to calculate a PEWS subscore cannot be determined, but serve as the best guess for vital signs at the time of PEWS assessment. A second limitation is that this study only evaluated patients with RRT activations or unplanned transfers. As a result, stable acute care patients may not experience the same benefits in accuracy and more timely documentation. It was felt that demonstrating improvement in patients showing signs of deterioration was the primary purpose, and thus the reason to study this population. Finally, we are unable to link the centerline shift to the implementation of the automated PEWS EHR calculator. During the study period, the implementation of other projects 16 to reduce non-ICU arrests may have influenced the centerline shift. It is unclear how much of that reduction was due to the automated calculator.",

The addition of decision support and ease of documentation was important for the success of this project.",
