These difficulties are influenced by the child's challenging behaviours, and the caregiver's coping strategies; factors impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. An online mixed methods survey was conducted on caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disabilities (n = 43) and children who are typically developing (n = 67). The results showed that presence of challenging behaviours related to neurodevelopmental disability, and caregiver coping strategies predicted caregiver psychological distress during lockdown. Themes that emerged included 'confusing messages and guidance', 'loss of freedom' and 'unsupported and forgotten'. The results demonstrate the pressing need for the implementation of appropriate support to protect the mental health of caregivers across the UK.",

Neurodevelopmental disabilities are characterised by social, cognitive, and adaptive skill deficits (Zayac & Johnston, 2008) , which can be associated with challenging behaviours (Lee, et al., 2008) , including verbal and/or physical aggression, self-injury, disturbed sleep, over-or inactivity, sexual or socially inappropriate behaviours and destructive tendencies (Benson, & Brooks, 2008; Myrbakk & Von Tetzchner, 2008) . Management of challenging behaviours impacts both the individuals' quality of life and opportunities (e.g. career, social, etc.) but also poses a significant additional burden on caregivers, leading to increased stress levels (Blacher & McIntyre, 2006; McConnell & Savage, 2015) .",

            "text": "Challenging behaviours indicate levels of severe mental stress and distress reactions in those with intellectual disabilities (Courtney & Perera, 2020) . These behaviours are exacerbated by disruption to day-to-day routines (adaptive functioning), or restrictions on enjoyed activities (Borthwick-Duffy, 1994; NICE guidelines -NG11; published May, 2015) and are conditional on the level of disability (Davies & Oliver, 2016) , depression (Davies & Oliver, 2014) and anxiety (Koritsas, & Iacono, 2015; Rzepecka, et al., 2011) . It could be hypothesised that the COVID-19 pandemic and related limitations to routine and lockdown arrangements (Anderson et al., 2020 ) are likely to trigger or exacerbate these factors. Conversely, it could be hypothesised that for some children, increased consistency associated with being at home, reduction of school pressures and bullying may reduce anxiety, actually leading to a reduction in challenging behaviours (Cappadocia et al., 2012; Weiss et al., 2015) . It is therefore important to examine how lockdown restrictions to education, respite and support services (that are known to reduce caregiver stress; for a review see Chan, & Sigafoos, 2001) will impact both the carer coping strategies and children's challenging behaviours. Indeed, there is evidence showing an increase in requests for psychotropic medication across Intellectual Disability (ID) services to manage children's challenging behaviour during the pandemic (BMJ 2020; 369: m1609) . This may indicate changes in the child behaviours or caregivers' perceptions of coping. It is therefore, crucial to understand the impact of the COVID-19 restrictions on both behaviours that challenge in children and caregivers' coping strategies.",

Challenging behaviours are not the only factor that influences caregiver distress. The wider caregiver context suggests; caregiver sleep quality, excessive caregiving demands, lack of child responsiveness and perceived caregiver burden are all predictors of caregiver psychological distress (Brummett et al., 2006; Snowdon, et al., 1994; Thompson, et al., 2008) . Sleep quality (crucial in health and wellbeing) is related to psychological problems in caregivers (Brummett et al., 2006; McCurry, et al., 2007) . Perceived caregiver burden is another source of psychological distress in caregiver groups (Clyburn, et al., 2000; Gallagher, et al., 2008; Maes et al., 2003) . Perceived burden includes overload, embarrassment, guilt, resentment, isolation, feelings of entrapment and loss of control (Zarit, et al., 1980) , with the guilt component being the greatest predictor of depression and anxiety in caregivers of children with intellectual disabilities (Gallagher et al., 2008) . Additionally, due to higher caregiver burden, parents who have children with intellectual disabilities experience more limited employment opportunities, which is proposed to further compound feelings of isolation and low self-esteem (Shearn & Todd, 2000) . COVID-19 has been reported to have significantly increased the perceived levels of strain and burden in caregivers who have children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) (Dhiman et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Furthermore, adaptation to a child's challenging behaviours requires parents to regulate their own behaviour in relation to their own interpretation and reaction to their child's behaviour. Where caregivers experience difficulty in managing their own emotional responses, they have been shown to be more likely to respond with harsh discipline or overt expressions of despair, contempt or depression (Bugental & Happaney, 2004) . Given the additional external stressors that many carers will experience in the current times (for example, financial, employment or other family concerns), recognition of the bi-directional relationship between caregiver coping strategies and challenging behaviours is necessary. A recent review highlighted how the complex interplay of factors including challenging behaviours, caregiver stress, coping strategies, and social support contribute to mental health outcomes in caregiver groups (for a review see Isa et al., 2016) . How these important interdependent factors have been impacted by COVID-19 needs to be investigated since recent research suggests that these issues have been further compounded due to the PHSM (Dhiman et al., 2020; Neece et al., 2020; O'Hagan & Kingdom, 2020) . In addition, research to date has examined the impact of COVID-19 on caregivers of children with ID focusing independently on either coping strategies (e.g. Willner et al., 2020) or levels of children's challenging behaviours (e,g, Bailey et al., 2021; Mutluer et al., 2020) . The current study examines both of these interdependent factors within the same UK sample, providing novel insight into how both parental coping strategies and children's challenging behaviours impact parental mental health during COVID-19 restrictions.",

Currently, little is known about how COVID-19 restrictions have impacted caregivers' experiences and perceptions of the pandemic restrictions. Therefore the current study also aimed to survey caregivers who have children with neurodevelopmental disabilities across the UK to determine: (2) Their experiences of the pandemic and restrictions; (3) Their awareness of how the pandemic has influenced their child's behaviours (4) How satisfied they are in their dealings with support services; and (5) their own needs as caregivers.",

Both groups were recruited via online adverts being posted on relevant social media groups and websites (e.g. parenting group webpages, parenting charities, neurodevelopmental disability webpages, neurodevelopmental charities etc.). Due to the opportunistic sampling the groups were not matched based on levels of distress before the COVID pandemic. A proportion of caregivers of typically developing children did not continue the survey beyond the demographic questionnaire and were omitted. Thus, 67 participants who identified themselves as caregivers of typically developing children were retained. Caregivers of children with a neurodevelopmental disability were asked to self-report recorded diagnoses received from clinical and/or pediatric services. Three participants were removed because their children had no diagnosis of neurodevelopmental disorder. The remaining 43 participants reported their child as having diagnoses of Autism Spectrum Condition (ASC; n = 27); ASC and Intellectual Disability (n = 1); Intellectual Disability (ID; n = 6); Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD; n = 5); Developmental Coordination Disorder (DCD; n = 1) and Dyspraxia (n = 1); Chromosome 7Q deletion (n = 1); and cerebral palsy (n = 1). For more information regarding participant characteristics, please see Table 1 . A Gpower calculation based on running regression models with 8 predictors (controlling for variables gender and age of child), with a moderate effect size of 0.3 indicated that a sample of n = 107 was required. Therefore the final sample size (n = 110) was still within these parameters.",

These subscales include active coping, planning, positive reframing, acceptance, humour, turning to religion, using emotional support, using instrumental support, self-distraction, denial, venting, substance use, behavioural disengagement, and self-blame. Active coping is the process of taking active steps to try to eliminate the stressor or to reorganise its effects. Planning; consists of thinking about how to handle a stressor which engages with action strategies, i.e. how best to cope with the problem. Positive reframing is a type of emotion-focused coping which involves construing a stressful transaction in positive terms and may lead a person to show problem-focused coping actions. Self-distraction refers to focusing on alternative activities. Denial is defined as trying to act like the stressor is not real or refusing to believe that the stressor exists. The opposite of denial is acceptance, which is a functional coping reaction in which an individual acknowledges the reality of a stressful situation in an effort to deal with the situation (Carver, 1997; Carver et al., 1989) . Use of emotional support is a type of emotion-focused coping which consists of obtaining understanding, sympathy and/or moral support from others. Instrumental support is an aspect of problem-focused coping, which involves seeking out information, help and/or advice (Carver et al., 1989) . Behavioural disengagement is a form of helplessness or giving up on attaining goals to solve the problems. Venting is the tendency to ventilate feelings about whatever distress or upset individual is experiencing. Religion is also an active coping tactic in which the individual tends to turn to religion. Humour involves making jokes or fun of a stressful situation. Self-blame refers to criticising oneself for responsibility during the situation. Substance use coping means taking alcohol or other drugs to deal with stressors (Carver, 1997) .",

For caregivers of typically developing children, all variables (Psychological Distress, Challenging Behaviours and COPE subscales) showed non-normal distributions. Visual inspections of histograms and Q-plots showed that the data were positively skewed; therefore, square root transformations were applied before Pearson correlations were carried out separately for each group (caregivers of children with neurodevelopmental disorders and children who are typically developing).

This similarity may be explained by the high number of participants who were caregivers of autistic children that took part in the current study. This highlights the significant risks to the psychological well-being of family carers. It helps provide us with knowledge of how coping strategies and potentially increasing challenging behaviours during lockdown influences caregivers' psychological distress. This is particularly important if the UK goes through another lockdown period as COVID-19 restrictions continue to ease.",

The difficulties experienced may be associated with a rigid cognitive style and a lack of psychological flexibility, sometimes characteristic of individuals with autism (Fujino et al., 2019; Sethi et al., 2019) .

Previous research carried out during an epidemic (i.e. the Severe Acute Respiratory -SARS epidemic in Taiwan) showed that increased levels of uncertainty and insecurity led to increased levels of anxiety in the general public (Ko et al., 2006) . Many of the parents in the current study reported that their children with neurodevelopmental disabilities began fixating on virus risk and social distancing measures. This may be underpinned by the complex link between heightened anxiety and restrictive and repetitive behaviours (RRBs) in neurodevelopmental disabilities (Rodgers et al., 2012) . RRBs refer to insistence on sameness, pre-occupation with a subject or object, and strict adherence to routines or rituals (APA, 2013) and have been proposed to play a role in the management of anxiety in neurodevelopmental disorders (Joosten, et al., 2009) . Although RRBs can be observed in typically developing children (e.g. \u00c7evikaslan et al., 2014) and children with various neurodevelopmental disabilities (e.g. Hepburn & MacLean, 2009) they are more often observed in autism (Knutsen, et al., 2019) . Therefore, the reporting of this effect in the current sample may be reflective of the high proportion of caregivers of children with autism.",

The parents highlighted that not being able to do the child's favourite activities or routines led to frustrations increasing challenging behaviours (Benson & Brooks, 2008; Minshawi et al., 2014; Tzischinsky et al., 2018) . It should be noted, however, that some parents reported positive effects of the lockdown, with some parents reporting that more time at home had a calming and positive effect on their child, possibly due to reduced school-related anxiety (Cappadocia et al., 2012; Weiss et al., 2015) .

Relatedly, carers have often identified respite services as the most helpful service received and have been shown to prevent or lessen caregiver stress and burnout (Cowen, & Reed, 2002) . The care is a source of relief since it offers care for a day, overnight, a few hours or several weeks at home or in an institution. It provides carers with an opportunity for a break, and a chance for them and other family members to revitalise themselves (Halpern, 1985) . In addition to respite interventions, social support is also shown to mitigate negative effects of caregiver isolation and stress (Calvete & Arroyabe, 2012; Duis et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2012) . Greater distress is reported in those families who perceive greater caregiver burden and limited social support (Dunn et al., 2001; Gallagher, et al., 2008) . Therefore the reduced social support during the lockdown measures was particularly detrimental to caregiver's mental health and indicates that if restrictive Lockdown was to occur again, other social and peer support must be put into place for this vulnerable group to reduce or mitigate these negative outcomes.",

Thirdly there was a mixture of developmental diagnoses, meaning different child characteristics could have influenced the type and intensity of challenging behaviours that caregivers were exposed to (McClintock, et al., 2003) ultimately impacting their mental health outcomes. Therefore, future studies (collecting new data and using existing datasets) should try to examine whether the current findings extend to caregivers of all disability groups. Finally, given the nature of online survey methodology there are related limitations; participants could not ask for clarification so some questions may have been misunderstood.

While levels of children's challenging behaviours (i.e. indicators of children's stress) continued to impact psychological distress in this vulnerable group, parental coping strategies were shown to further increase the risk of psychological distress As coping strategies are potentially modifiable, supporting caregivers in employing adaptive coping strategies has potential benefits for the transition out of covid-19 restrictions. Difficulties communicating aspects of the pandemic as well as the children's adherence to rules and routine caused an increase in frustration and challenging behaviours in the children. This increase in challenging behaviours as well as lack of social, educational and professional support exasperated caregiver's feelings of helplessness and denial during the pandemic leading to increased amounts of psychological distress. Lessons need to be learned so that if restrictions are re-introduced, these negative mental outcomes can be mitigated against and avoided by implementing appropriate support to protect the mental health of caregivers across the UK.",
