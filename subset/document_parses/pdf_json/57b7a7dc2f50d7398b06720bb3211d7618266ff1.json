            "text": "Background COVID-19 has exploited the inequities within the US housing system. Examining the association between housing and health during the pandemic is imperative to reducing health inequities and improving population health. Methods We analysed 957 714 responses from the Household Pulse Survey Study, collected between April and July 2020. Using survey-weighted multivariable regression analyses, we assessed the relationships between housing tenure and health, both on average and over time, as well as how these relationships were moderated by COVID-19-related hardships including job loss, food insecurity and inability to afford housingrelated costs. We controlled for a variety of potential socioeconomic and demographic confounding factors. Results We found that housing tenure was significantly associated with both self-rated health and mental distress. Compared with homeowners without mortgage debt, homeowners with mortgage debt reported worse self-rated health (\u03b2=\u22120.13; 95% CI \u22120.15 to \u22120.12, p<0.001) and greater mental distress (\u03b2=0.50; 95% CI 0.44 to 0.55, p<0.001). Renters also reported worse self-rated health (\u03b2=\u22120.18; 95% CI \u22120.20 to \u22120.16, p<0.001) and greater mental distress (\u03b2=0.76; 95% CI 0.69 to 0.83, p<0.001) than homeowners without mortgage debt. Across all tenure groups, self-rated health decreased (\u03b2=\u22120.007; 95% CI \u22120.011 to \u22120.004, p<0.001) and mental distress increased (\u03b2=0.05; 95% CI 0.05 to 0.06, p<0.001) over this period. Additionally, time and COVID-19-related hardships compounded differences in health status between homeowners and renters. Conclusions These results add to a limited body of evidence suggesting that, during this period, housing instability and COVID-19-related hardships have contributed to an increase in health inequities in the USA.",

            "text": "Housing affordability has direct impacts on health and health inequities. 1 2 Affordable housing is often defined in terms of a ratio of income to housing-related expenditures, including but not limited to rent, mortgage, property taxes, utilities and repairs. In the USA, the Department of Housing and Urban Development defines affordable housing as a household that spends no more than 30% of its income on housing costs. 3 Homes that pay more than this are considered housing insecure with implications of having less money for food, transportation and medication, among other basic needs. 4 5 Combined with a chronic shortage of affordable housing and a growing urban population, housing insecurity is a rising issue in the USA and global cities like Bogota, Moscow and Beijing. 6 In 2019, 37.1 million US households were housing insecure, while 17.6 million households were spending more than 50% of their income on housing costs. 7 A large proportion were low-income households, placing them at higher risk of housing instability. For those already living in unstable situations prior to the pandemic, eviction was a risk, with more than 2 million eviction cases filed per year and about half of them resulting in displacement. 8 COVID-19 has exacerbated housing inequalities resulting in what is projected to be an increase in future evictions and greater housing instability. 9 10 Although moratoria of evictions and foreclosures have helped stave off a flood of evictions, they have not solved the accumulating debt these households will face postmoratoria. 11 12 The fear or experience of being evicted or foreclosed, as well as frequently moving and in some cases, becoming homeless, has been associated with negative health outcomes. [13] [14] [15] Although limited, existing research has connected housing unaffordability and instability to self-rated health (SRH), mental health, including symptoms of depression and anxiety, and cardiovascular disease. [16] [17] [18] Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, recent studies have examined the health consequences of evictions during COVID-19 and the effects of housing conditions during a time where 'staying home' was a primary preventive method. [19] [20] [21] However, there remain few studies that have considered the socioeconomic impacts of COVID-19 on the associations between housing and health. Prior to the pandemic, job loss or financial strain was associated with housing instability and poor health, particularly among renters. One study showed that those who reported being housing insecure (feeling worried about having enough money to pay rent or mortgage costs) were approximately two times more likely to postpone medical treatment or self-report poor or fair health. 22 Other studies have reported higher risk of depression and poorer health among those who have been evicted, compared with those who have not. 23 Examining these relations during COVID-19 is a critical step to ensure policies and programmes are in place to reduce the housing and health inequities in years to come.",

Mental distress was derived from four items asking respondents about the frequency with which they experienced feelings of depression or hopelessness, lack of interest or enjoyment, uncontrollable worry, and nervousness or anxiety. Each item was asked on a 0 (not having experienced the feeling at all) to 3 (having experienced the feeling nearly every day) scale. These four items represented modified versions of the two-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-2) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder scales. 29 30 To create one continuous indicator of mental distress with a 0-12 range (ie, the PHQ-4 score), we summed these items. PHQ-4 has been shown to be an accurate and reliable measure of mental health in a variety of populations. [31] [32] [33] ",

We used the week number of the HPS data release to assess change in health status related to the duration of the pandemic. Week 1 referred to data collected between 23 April and 5 May, while week 12 referred to data collected between 16 July and 21 July. Job loss was measured by an item which asked respondents to identify whether anyone in their household had lost employment since 13 March 2020. Food security was measured by asking respondents to identify how confident they were in their ability to afford the foods they need in the next 4 weeks. Response values ranged from 1 (not confident at all) to 4 (very confident). Given few responses indicating 'not confident at all' (0) or 'slightly confident', (1) we combined these categories as 'low confidence' for analysis. Finally, ability to pay housing-associated costs was measured by asking respondents how confident they were in their ability to pay their next rent/mortgage payment on time.",

We chose GLMs over hierarchical linear models for our analyses because 80% of survey respondents were only surveyed once, and because when we calculated the unconditional intraclass correlation (ICC) for these data, we found that the per cent of variance in both SRH (ICC=0.002) and mental distress (ICC=0.002) explained by the clustering of survey responses within individuals was less than 1%. Researchers have observed that bias in the parameter estimates of weighted multilevel models increases as ICC decreases. 34 35 Finally, we fit a series of GLMs with interaction terms to determine if and how relationships between housing tenure and health were moderated by (1) time, (2) household job loss, (3) food security and (4) ability to pay housing-associated costs. To test the overall significance of the interaction terms (ie, to identify significant moderation), we compared the fit of models that included interaction terms to the fit of comparable models that did not, using \u03a7 2 tests. We present adjusted regression coefficients from our analyses in which we controlled for the effects of the householdlevel and individual-level socioeconomic and demographic variables described above. We only report interaction effect estimates for models in which including the interaction term significantly improved model fit. We performed our analyses in R (V.0.2) using the survey package (V.4.0) to apply survey weights. 36 37 The HPS public-use data files include survey weights, calculated by the CB, which can be used to make statistical analyses of the HPS data nationally representative by accounting for respondents' unequal probabilities of being selected to participate in the survey. We weighted all summaries and analyses to account for the complex design and sampling methodology of the HPS. Table 1 summarises the data used in this study. Between April and July 2020, approximately 51.6% of the US adult population was female, 56.0% was married, 64.1% identified as non-Hispanic white, 62.5% had received some college education, 81.0% had some health insurance and 58.4% lived in households that had an income of less than $75 000 per year. The mean age of the adult population was 48.5 (SD=16.8), and the average number of people per household was 3.5 (SD=2.0).",

These findings are consistent with other research studies that have demonstrated associations between housing and health before the pandemic. 22 38 39 We also examined how COVID-19-related hardships (job loss, food insecurity and inability to pay housing-associated costs) moderated associations between housing tenure and health during this period. Our results suggest that job loss exacerbated differences in mental distress between renters and homeowners. Food insecurity and low confidence in paying rent/mortgage were associated with low SRH and high mental distress among both renters and homeowners; however, renters were more likely to experience these hardships. Overall, low confidence in paying rent/mortgage had the strongest association with mental distress, while low food confidence had the strongest association with SRH.

Renters and homeowners with mortgage debt who planned to defer their rent/loan payments reported better SRH and less mental distress than those with low or moderate confidence in their ability to make those payments. Still, there remain questions on how deferral decisions are made and what they imply. Among renters, deferral of rent may have occurred as an agreement between landlord and tenant during this time. Alternately, renters in the sample may have relied on the moratorium on evictions implemented by local, state and federal governments throughout the pandemic. Although such moratoria made it illegal to evict tenants during their implemented period, they did not stop rent from accumulating. Therefore, unless tenants can take advantage of stateimplemented rent relief programmes like the Michigan Eviction Diversion Program, they could be evicted once moratoria end. Contrary, homeowners were provided relief under the CARES Act through a moratorium on foreclosures for all federally or Government Sponsored Enterprises-backed mortgages (Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac). The CARES Act also granted homeowners the ability to request and obtain a forbearance for up to 1 year. Unlike renters, there would be no accumulation of interest or additional fees. This suggests that in the short term, having the option to defer payments may have helped improve health outcomes for individuals who might not have otherwise been able to afford these payments, providing some evidence on the success of such policies.",
