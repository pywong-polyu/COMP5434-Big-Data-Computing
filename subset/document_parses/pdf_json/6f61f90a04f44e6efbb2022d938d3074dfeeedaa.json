Regarding the lack of disease-specific treatments, repurposing drug therapy is currently considered a promising therapeutic approach in pandemic situations. Recently, the combination therapy of Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor baricitinib has been authorized for emergency COVID-19 hospitalized patients; however, this strategy's safety, drug-drug interactions, and cellular signaling pathways remain a tremendous challenge. Methods In this study, we aimed to provide a deep insight into the baricitinib combination therapies in severe COVID-19 patients through reviewing the published literature on PubMed, Scopus, and Google scholar databases. We also focused on cellular and subcellular pathways related to the synergistic effects of baricitinib plus antiviral agents, virus entry, and cytokine storm (CS) induction. The safety and effectiveness of this strategy have also been discussed in moderate to severe forms of COVID-19 infection.",

The COVID-19 characterizes by multisystemic manifestations, which can be varied between different age groups. The main clinical symptoms in COVID-19 patients include fever, cough, and dyspnea. While fatigue, headache, anosmia, ageusia, cutaneous manifestations, and gastrointestinal involvement have been reported as minor symptoms of the illnesses [1] [2] [3] [4] . Based on a cohort study from China, COVID-19 severity can be classified into (i) mild to moderate (\u223d81% patients with mild symptoms up to mild pneumonia), (ii) severe (\u223d14% of patients with dyspnea, hypoxia, or more than 50% lung involvement), and (iii) critical (\u223d5% of patients with respiratory failure, shock, or multiorgan system dysfunction) [5, 6] .

On 19 November 2020, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an emergency use authorization (EUA) for baricitinib combined with antiviral remdesivir to treat hospitalized COVID-19 adults (2 years of age or older) and pediatric patients requiring supplemental oxygen, invasive mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) [16] . However, this EUA was revised on 28 July 2021 to meet the safety issues and protect public health and no longer requires baricitinib to be used in combination with remdesivir. Based on the scope of the latest version of this authorization, baricitinib can be used to treat COVID-19 in pediatric patients and hospitalized adults, 2 years of age or older, receiving supplemental oxygen, non-invasive or invasive mechanical ventilation, or ECMO [17] . It should be noted that the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) recommends baricitinib administration for severe COVID-19 patients who require high-flow oxygen/non-invasive ventilation [18] . Baricitinib (an IL-6 receptor antibody) is a selective inhibitor of JAK 1 and 2, approved for the treatment of active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) when patients have shown an inadequate response to other medicines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors [10] . Based on a doubleblind, randomized placebo-controlled trial, combination therapy baricitinib with remdesivir reduced recovery time and accelerated clinical status improvement in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, compared to subjects who received placebo plus remdesivir alone, notably among those receiving high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation [15] .",

            "text": "Different repurposing drug therapies, including antiviral, anti-inflammatory, antiprotozoal, and fibrinolytic agents, have been investigated during the COVID-19 pandemic [9, 22, 23] . In this respect, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and FDA recommended using remdesivir and convalescent blood products as the most promising agents for COVID-19 treatment [10] . There are two potential ways to develop drugs against the SARS-CoV-2 virus: (i) targeting the host cell biology, which interferes in the viral entrance, transformation, and replication, and (ii) targeting the virus biology and components [24] . It should be noted that the host cell targeting with novel agents may lead to a series of unwanted side effects in the same target tissue or other tissues. Besides, a high rate of the mutations in the virus genome may induce drug resistance into the novel agents used for targeting the SARS-CoV-2 virus biology [25] . Since most viruses can affect the cells similarly, finding a broad-spectrum antiviral agent may be a promising way to control the virus disease outbreak [26] . According to the clinical data, combination therapies are mostly recommended options in hospitalized patients of COVID-19 [27] . From different points of view, combination therapies usually show several advantages compared to monotherapy, including decreased drug resistance and increased tolerability to adverse effects due to the reduction in the dosage of each drug in combination form [6] . It has been shown that antiinflammatory agents were not beneficial for patients during the previous pandemic diseases such as SARS and MERS. However, in SARS-CoV-2, anti-inflammatory and immunemodulating agents have their place in the therapeutic regimen due to the extensive hyper-inflammation reactions in the severe forms of the disease [27] . Tocilizumab (anti-IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody) is an adjunctive therapy administrated to control the cytokine release syndrome caused by hyper-inflammatory responses in severe COVID-19 patients. The clinical efficacy of human monoclonal antibodies such as sarilumab, anakinra, and ruxolitinib has been evaluated to manage cytokine storm (CS) in severe respiratory failure by COVID-19 [28] . Substantial information on the efficacy and safety of these trials can be found on Clini-calTrials.gov database (http:// clini caltr ials. gov).",

It is a positive-sense singlestranded RNA virion with a 29,881 bp genome length. The essential structural proteins in SARS-CoV-2 are spike (S), matrix (M), small envelope (E), and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. Homotrimeric S protein, as a critical protein for the fusion and recognition of the virus, is composed of an extracellular N-terminus, a transmembrane domain, and a short intracellular C-terminus. Each of the trimers of S protein is coated with 66 N-linked host-derived glycans to escape from the host immune cells [15] . The glycosylated S protein consists of S1 and S2 subunits [30] . The S1 subunit is responsible for interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor and determination of the cellular tropism with receptor-binding domain (RDB) [29] . The S2 subunit is involved in viral fusion [31] by heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and heptad repeat 2 (HR2) domains [30] . The S1 interaction with ACE-2 promotes the dissociation of S1 and transformation of meta-stable pre-fusion S2 to the more-stable post-fusion form [27] . In post-fusion, the HR2 conformation changes to a rigid helix with a flexible loop that interacts with HR1 and can lead to a six-helical bundle S2 [30] .",

            "text": "The SARS-CoV-2 entry into the host cells can be mediated by fusion and endocytosis pathways (Fig. 1) . Fusion mechanism is usually triggered through (i) the recognizing of ACE-2 receptor by RBD, (ii) subsequent interaction between the S protein and ACE-2, and (iii) cleavage and activation of the S protein into the S1 and S2 at the S1/S2 cleavage site by transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) [30, 32, 33] . The SARS-CoV-2, like the other viruses, takes advantage of receptor-mediated endocytosis [31, 32] , which is regulated by the numb-associated kinase (NAK) family, including adaptor-associated protein kinase (AAK-1) and cyclin G-associated kinase (GAK) [34] . The activated AAK-1 and GAK lead to the phosphorylation of the adaptor protein 2 (AP2) complex and consequently promote the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of the virus [35] . So far, two possible mechanisms have been suggested for the SARS-CoV-2 endocytosis. In the first theory, the virus binds to the ACE-2 receptor outside of the membrane. The endocytosis process initiates by assembling clathrin, coat protein, in the inner side of the plasma membrane to form a vesicle (Fig. 1 ). In the second theory, SARS-CoV-2 utilizes the clathrin-dependent endocytosis directly to get the entrance permission. Following the virus entry, the viral RNA is released into the cytoplasmic space [30] , and the production of the structural and non-structural proteins is initiated in the infected cells [36] . Finally, the virions of coronaviruses are formed by budding into the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartments (ERGIC) [15] and released as new viral particles ( Fig. 1 ) [30] . Based on recently published data, there is an abundant expression of endocytosis markers in nasal epithelial cells such as dynamin, GTPase, clathrin, and caveolae-mediated ones, where the fusion and macropinocytosis of the viruses can be significantly raised, unlike the pneumocytes cells [24] . One of the promising therapeutic approaches is blocking the virus entry by targeting AAK-1, GAK, and ACE-2 receptors and inhibiting its intracellular assembly [31] . However, it has been postulated that anti-hypertensive drugs, which act against ACE-2 receptor, could increase the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection [37] or mortality [38] .",

The uncontrolled and excessive release of pro-inflammatory agents and cytokines causes CS. Based on the clinical data from severe COVID-19 patients, there is a significant release of the inflammatory factors, including IL-6, IL-10, and TNF-\u03b1. Further, patients in an intensive care unit (ICU) show a more considerable increment in IL-2, IL-7, IL-10, TNF-\u03b1, and granulocytecolony-stimulating factor (GCSF) [30, 39] . Thus, it has been suggested that immunomodulation may be a beneficial therapeutic option to overcome such situations in the severe form of the disease. As shown in Fig. 2 , the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of the host immune cells detect and respond to the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [40] . The PAMPs are the molecular structures such as peptidoglycans and lipopolysaccharides essential for the pathogens' life cycle, and many of them cannot be found in Fig. 1 Schematic representation of SARS-CoV-2 structure, virus entry, and replication in host cells. Virus cell entry by endocytosis is a clathrin-dependent route. Baricitinib effect is usually related to the irregularity in AP2-associated protein kinase 1 and inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry through the clathrin-dependent pathway. Antiviral function of remdesivir is related to inhibiting the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) the host. However, one of the exceptions is the pathogenderived nucleic acids.",

            "text": "The JAK/STAT (Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription) signaling pathway is related to various biological processes in the body, including cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, apoptosis, immune regulation, and hematopoiesis [45] . It has been recently indicated patients. The pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) detect and respond to the pathogenassociated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are expressed by immune and non-immune cells. Retinoid acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I), cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS), and melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA-5) are receptors for detecting the viral genome in the cytoplasm. The activation of these sensors leads to an increase of TIR-domaincontaining adaptor inducing interferon \u03b2 (TRIF), stimulation of interferon genes (STINGs), and mitochondrial antiviralsignaling protein (MAVS). The activation of interferon regulatory factor-3, 7 (IRF-3, IRF-7), and nuclear factor-kappa (NF-\u03baB) initiate a subcellular signaling cascade, induce interferons (INFs) and pro-inflammatory cytokines, subsequently leading to CS phenomena that this pathway is involved in the SARS-CoV-2-induced CS syndrome [46] . The JAK/STAT signaling pathway consists of three main components: (i) tyrosine kinase-associated receptor, (ii) JAK, and (iii) STAT [47] . Four JAK family members JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, and tyrosine kinase 2 (TYK2), are receptor-associated tyrosine kinases, which JAK1, JAK2, and TYK2 are expressed in a wide verity of mammalian tissues, whereas JAK3 is in the hematopoietic cells. They can transmit extracellular signals from many pro-inflammatory cytokines to STATs molecules [48] . The STAT family (STAT1-STAT6), as a downstream target of JAKs, is one of the most crucial cytokine-activated transcription factors in the immune response process and plays a vital role in the activation of signal and transcription in the neuronal and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways [49] . There are two canonical and non-canonical ways of stimulating the JAK-STAT pathway. The canonical JAK-STAT activates via high-affinity interaction between extracellular signaling of cytokines and their cognate receptors [50] . Various cytokines and growth factors can participate in signal transmission through this pathway, including ILs, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), growth hormone (GH), platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and IFNs [51] . JAK phosphorylates the tyrosine residues of many target proteins; thus, it affects signal translocation from the extracellular to the intracellular [52] . JAK activation mediates phosphorylation of the STATs, leading to form dimers of phosphorylated STATs (STAT-STAT). Dimer of STATs can translocate into the nucleus, bind to specific DNA sequences, and transmit extracellular cytokine signals into transcriptional responses [53] . This pathway can be inactivated by negative regulators such as suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS), protein inhibitors of activated STATs (PIAS), and protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs) [54] . Other signaling molecules are involved in the JAK pathway, such as PI3 kinase (PI3K), mitogen-activated kinase (MAPK), extracellular receptor kinase (ERK) [50] .",

            "text": "In the canonical pathway, unphosphorylated STATs are usually located in the cytoplasm. In the non-canonical, some unphosphorylated STATs localized on heterochromatin in the nucleus associated with specific proteins contribute to maintaining the heterochromatin state [50] . Increasing the phosphorylation of the STAT by JAK or other tyrosine kinases reduces the amount of unphosphorylated STATs on heterochromatin. Dispersed phosphorylated STATs can affect total transcriptional events through binding to cognitive sites in euchromatin, chromatin modification, and inducing gene expression [55] . As CS is relatively common in severe cases of COVID-19, anti-inflammation therapy may help prevent further injury. A variety of JAK inhibitors, including baricitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor), ruxolitinib (oral JAK1/2 inhibitor), upadacitinib (JAK1 inhibitor), tofacitinib (JAK1, JAK 2, JAK3, and TYK2 inhibitor), and fedratinib (JAK2 inhibitor) [56] , are currently approved for the treatment of many inflammation-driven pathologies [57] . For the management of COVID-19-associated CS, FDA authorized combination therapy with baricitinib (JAK1/2 inhibitor), which can be applicable for hospitalized COVID-19 patients. The JAK/STAT signaling pathway and inhibition effects of baricitinib have been shown in Fig. 3 . Baricitinib (Olumiant) has been approved for the treatment of moderate to severe RA. The most common drugs against RA are corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), TNF inhibitors, and JAK inhibitors [58] . Chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease RA results from an imbalance between anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines and loss of immunologic tolerance of autoreactive immune cells. As a fundamental insight, cytokines are now known as the main actors of autoimmunity disorders, and biologic agents targeting cytokines considered to treat immune-mediated diseases [57] .",

The function of the baricitinib against COVID-19 is usually related to the irregularity in AP2-associated protein kinase 1 and inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. It is proposed that baricitinib shows antiviral effects by inhibiting upregulated INF-1 caused by the ACE-2 receptor and subsequently blocking the cell entry of viruses [63] . Hence, baricitinib can prevent cell entry and SARS-CoV-2-initiated inflammation responses [62] through clathrinmediated endocytosis inhibition [59, 62] . As mentioned in the previous section, ACE-2 receptors represent cellular ports to enter the SARS-CoV-2 into the lung cells. Several clinical trials have been conducted regarding the role of baricitinib in the management of COVID-19 (Table 1) . In this respect, decreased inflammatory markers and improved oxygenation have been reported in COVID-19 patients treated with baricitinib [64, 65] . In a most updated meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials, it has been demonstrated that JAK inhibitors (e.g., baricitinib) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients can significantly reduce the risk of death and mechanical ventilation or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation by 43% and 36%, respectively, compared to standard of care alone [66] . In another metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials, the safety and effectiveness of JAK inhibitors for hospitalized COVID-19 have also been demonstrated [67] . In an observational and longitudinal trial, COVID-19 patients treated with baricitinib showed rapid recovery of circulating T and B cell frequencies, a marked reduction in serum levels of cytokines (e.g., IL-6, IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1), and an increased level of antibody against the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.",

In a clinical study for predicting the mortality of 150 patients in Wuhan, the evidence showed that most mortalities are due to CS and myocarditis. There is also a relation between cytokine elevation and the severity of COVID-19 disease [29] . In a case report study, a 50-year-old man with follicular non-Hodgkin lymphoma successfully recovered from COVID-19 after receiving remdesivir, baricitinib, tocilizumab hydroxychloroquine, and broad-spectrum antibiotics [71] . In another study by Izumo and colleagues on 44 patients with severe COVID-19, it has been shown that combination therapy using baricitinib, remdesivir, and dexamethasone (BRD) was effective, and the incidence rate of AEs was low. Based on the results, the BRD therapy in most patients (90%, 17/19 patients) leads to avoiding the need for mechanical ventilation, reducing the duration of the hospitalization, supplemental oxygen therapy, and recovery time [72] . An observational cohort study has shown that a combination of baricitinib with corticosteroids in patients with moderate to severe SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia can be associated with a more remarkable improvement in pulmonary function when compared with corticosteroids alone [73] .",

Despite the beneficial outcomes of baricitinib in controlling the inflammatory conditions, its administration may associate with some AEs such as serious infection, *Please refer to https:// clini caltr ials. gov/ for more details thrombosis, and hypersensitivity reactions [77] . Liver toxicity, gastrointestinal complication, and cardiovascular side effects may also occur during baricitinib therapy. It has been reported that the baricitinib therapy may be associated with the occurrence of infectious disease and reactivation of latent infections such as tuberculosis (TB), hepatitis B, Epstein-Barr virus, varicella-zoster, and herpes simplex [78] . There is a negligible TB risk in RA patients treated with JAK inhibitor baricitinib [79] . Thus, baricitinib administration should be avoided in COVID-19 patients with known active TB unless the potential benefits outweigh the potential risks of baricitinib treatment in patients with serious active infections other than COVID-19 or chronic/recurrent infections [18] . Venous thromboembolism is another AE that may be occurred during baricitinib administration, so COVID-19 patients with deep-vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism status should be evaluated promptly and treated appropriately. In addition, baricitinib therapy should be discontinued in patients with severe hypersensitivity reactions [18, 80] .",

Indeed, these results cannot be generalized to all COVID-19 patients, and further controlled, more extensive studies should be conducted to confirm the long-term safety of the treatment [81] . Overall, the risk of AEs in hospitalized severe or critical COVID-19 patients receiving baricitinib was not greater than those not receiving baricitinib.

Based on recently published reports, baricitinib coupled with remdesivir can control COVID-19 in adult patients. It seems baricitinib can be a suitable candidate for combination therapy because of its low plasma protein binding and low interaction with drug transporters and cytochromes P450 (CYPs) enzymes. It should be noted that baricitinib has minimal interaction with the direct-acting antivirals against SARS-CoV-2, including remdesivir, favipiravir, and lopinavir [62] . Besides, the combination of baricitinib and remdesivir reduces the aberrant inflammatory response and viral replication and provides a series of positive therapeutic outcomes [34, 59] . However, the consequent immunosuppression following baricitinib administration leads to a delay in the clearance of virus load. Recently, baricitinib has been authorized by the FDA for hospitalized adults and pediatric patients older than 2 years in emergencies. Based on the NIH COVID-19 treatment guidelines, baricitinib and remdesivir have been recommended to treat COVID-19 in hospitalized, non-intubated patients who require oxygen supplementation. The combination of baricitinib or tocilizumab with dexamethasone alone or dexamethasone plus remdesivir (NCT04421027) has been recommended in hospitalized COVID-19 patients on high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation, whose have evidence of clinical progression or increased markers of inflammation. Baricitinib dose is dependent on the eGFR, and the duration of the therapy is recommended up to 14 days or until hospital discharge. In a low level of eGFR (< 15 mL/min/1.73 m 2 ), baricitinib is not recommended. It has been suggested that if neither baricitinib nor tocilizumab is available or feasible to administrate, tofacitinib and IV sarilumab can be used instead of baricitinib and tocilizumab, respectively. In addition, remdesivir administration is not recommended at eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m 2 . Clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of remdesivir plus baricitinib against COVID-19 are listed in Table 2 . Based on the scope of the latest version of EUA authorization, it no longer requires baricitinib to be used in combination with remdesivir [18] . In addition, patients who receive baricitinib for the treatment of COVID-19 should not receive tocilizumab or other immunomodulators as no adequate evidence is available for its combined administration [83] .",

            "text": "Immunomodulation therapy by baricitinib has been recently authorized in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. Baricitinib can interrupt the signaling of multiple cytokines and alleviate the host's hyper-inflammatory responses caused by increased IL-6 and IFNs \u03b1 and \u03b2 [10, 59, 84] . IFNs, as one of the most potent antiviral mediators, prevent virus replication during the early stage of the infection. These molecules, through the activation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway (JAK1/JAK2), result in the upregulation of several IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), which can rapidly increase the antiviral effects inside the infected cells [85] . Thus, the administration of JAK inhibitors such as baricitinib in viral infections may seem a limited therapeutic option. However, it has been shown that the high level of IFNs \u03b1 and \u03b2 can be beneficial in the early stage of SARS and MERS, whereas it may lead to damages in the later stage of the diseases [86, 87] . Therefore, JAK-STAT inhibitors might be a potential strategy in more severe COVID-19 patients. Besides, baricitinib may show antiviral effects through targeting the host cell entities are involved in virus entry into the cells [59] . Regarding the possible interaction of baricitinib with drug-metabolizing enzymes such as CYPs [15, 84] , baricitinib, along with antiviral agents such as remdesivir, may be considered as a suitable candidate for combination strategies. Although physicians were concerned about potential AEs of baricitinib combination therapy (e.g., immunosuppression, secondary infections, and thrombosis), fortunately, this combination therapy showed significantly fewer adverse effects in clinical subjects. However, the exact mechanisms of combination treatment with baricitinib are not fully understood.",

Therefore, early identification and isolation of patients and timely initiation of supportive care (e.g., respiratory support and micronutrient therapy) to prevent the progression of infection play an essential role in disease management [88] . There is no need to administrate the JAK inhibitors in patients with mild to moderate symptoms (\u223d81%) without requiring hospital care, and viruses can be cleared from the body through IFN-mediated signaling pathways. In hospitalized adults and pediatric patients (age \u2265 2 years old), baricitinib therapy has been recommended as an emergency. Consequently, for choosing a treatment option in COVID-19, several factors, including the general condition of patients, stage of the disease, the clinical status of patients, drug-drug interaction, and safety issues, must be evaluated to increase the chance of the treatment and improve the clinical outcomes. Finally, it seems that simultaneous applying of combination therapy and drug repurposing can be a promising approach to deal with the pandemic situation.",

Various cytokines and growth factors can participate in signal transmission through the JAK pathway, including different interleukins (ILs), interferons (INFs \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3), granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), growth hormone (GH), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and leptin hormone. Interaction between the receptors and ligands leads to phosphorylation of the tyrosine residues of many target proteins by JAK enzymes and affects signal translocation from the extracellular to the intracellular. Then, phosphorylated STATs form dimers (STAT-STAT) can translocate into the nucleus, bind to specific DNA sequences, and transmit extracellular cytokine signals into transcriptional responses",
