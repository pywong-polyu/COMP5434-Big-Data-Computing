The objective of this study is to characterize the effect of commonly used pasteurization techniques on viruses in HM and non-HM matrices.

First, we carried out a robust search strategy, in addition to manual searches of grey literature, to generate a complete list of studies, irrespective of language or year published that assessed the impact of thermal pasteurization on viral load in human milk and other matrices. The studies in this review reported on a wide range of thermal pasteurization parameters (low-temperature long-time, high-temperature short-time) across several viruses in a diverse set of matrices. Despite these, the interpretation of our results should be considered alongside its limitations. First, this review was conducted by a single reviewer which may have introduced potential selection bias during initial screening. As a result, our review may not have captured all possible studies. Despite this, the purpose of this review was to rapidly and broadly characterize how viruses in any matrix, including human milk, might respond to thermal pasteurization. Second, the reduction in viral load or detectable live virus that was extracted was approximated if multiple strains of a given virus genus were studied, despite the potential of strain-specific variation in thermal resistance. Third, in our comparison of studies that assessed similar viruses in both a human milk and non-human milk matrix, we chose to aggregate the results to match, to the best of our ability, the pasteurization parameters tested in human milk. While this may have allowed us to assess the temperature and time requirements to achieve a certain log reduction, we were limited to a narrow range of pasteurization conditions. To our knowledge, this rapid review is the first to broadly summarize the literature that has reported on the impact of any thermal pasteurization on virus survival. The results from this study highlight our limited understanding with respect to the effect of thermal pasteurization on viruses in human milk-this is especially relevant given the possibility that novel viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, may be present in human milk.
