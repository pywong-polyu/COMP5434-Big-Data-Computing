Early in the course of the pandemic, hospitals ran the risk of exhausting their supplies of ventilators, ICU beds, and personal protective equipment (PPE); the capacity of the health care workforce to meet the added demand was equally strained. In the late winter and early spring of 2020, NYS and New York City bore a disproportional share of the burden, with approximately half of all confirmed cases in America.",

Between 28 April and 30 June 2020, the height of the pandemic in NYS, CHPS collaborators recruited members of multiple health care professions across NYS to participate. Professions included physicians, nurses and nurse practitioners, medical residents, physician assistants, and ancillary health professionals such as respiratory therapists, paramedics, emergency medical technicians, visiting nurses, home health care workers, and others. Participants were drawn from community-based settings, as well as hospitals and other institutional settings.",

More female physicians responded (49% female physicians in the study sample vs 35% in the target population). Physicians responding to the survey were also skewed older (32% sample older than 60 vs 23% population). Physicians from upstate regions were represented slightly more than downstate regions. After the raking procedure, the weighted sample more closely approximated the physicians target population in age, gender and geographic distribution. (Table 1 ) Similar adjustments were seen with the Nurse Practitioner and Physician Assistant groups. After raking, the survey-weighted sample equaled a target population of 137,710 (95% CI 134422, 140999) physicians, nurse practitioners and physician assistants licensed in New York State. Our weighted sample had a mean age of 50.4 (95% CI 49.9, 51.0), of whom 46.1% (95% CI 43.7, 48.5) were female.
