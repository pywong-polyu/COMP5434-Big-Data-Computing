Public health restrictions have created unintended consequences, magnifying isolation, racial stigma, social inequities, and decreasing access to care [4] . At the same time, migrants are more likely to work in precarious front-line roles, such as taxi-cab operators, hotel housekeepers, long-term care workers, and food servers [5] .

COVID-19 outbreaks locked down many clinics and dramatically reduced on-site care. This has triggered a global surge in virtual care (telemedicine), forcing patients, family physicians and clinic teams to adapt rapidly. While these virtual care tools are aimed to increase the accessibility of mental health care services, there is a paucity of data on their usage during the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically with vulnerable populations such as refugees and other migrants. Thus, the objectives of this mixed methods study are to explore general practitioner and other refugee clinician perspectives on the accessibility and delivery of mental health care, with an extra focus on virtual care, for refugees and migrants during the first 6 months of the COVID-19 pandemic. We address the following research question:",

Specifically, we adapted categorical questions on provider characteristics (profession, gender, years of experience with refugee care), patient characteristics (languages spoken, country of origin), and interpreter availability. The English survey was initially translated by a francophone member of our study team (V.G). This translation was further verified by other French-speaking team members (O.M., K.P). Survey participants were provided with the option to complete the survey in either English or French. None of the participants indicated that they would like to complete the survey in French. The survey was pilot tested on three experienced clinicians (T.H., N.S., M.W.) and revised for conciseness and clarity. The online survey collected information on mental health interventions offered to refugees, challenges faced by clinicians in offering care, and what alternative services clinicians believe would allow them to optimize the delivery of care during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The research team then discussed and agreed upon a set of codes to apply to subsequent transcripts. An analytical framework consisting of 3 themes, 8 categories and 40 codes was developed. This analytic framework was applied independently, in duplicate, to all transcripts. Disagreements in indexing of transcripts were resolved through discussion. Interpretation was performed through iterative discussions with the entire research team. We triangulated our quantitative and qualitative data. Key qualitative findings were juxtaposed with closed-ended survey responses and reported according to major themes. As a final member checking exercise, we asked key clinician experts to comment on our draft findings.",

Our results suggest an exacerbation of barriers and of mental health conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, many clinicians reported that the newly established jobs of their refugee patients disappeared as businesses shut down. Language and integration settlement classes were cancelled, leading to further social isolation and maintaining education disparities between refugees and migrants and Canadian-born individuals. Many clinicians reported that their refugee patients were barely able to afford satisfactory housing and faced evictions due to loss of income, despite Canadian government attempts to prevent evictions during the pandemic restrictions.

Early research suggests refugees can benefit from virtual care; however, more equity and technology access research is needed for cultural and linguistically diverse populations [23] . For example, clinicians reported that certain refugees expressed a desire for on-site visits with their trusted clinician to reduce angst and anxiety related to COVID-19. As well, many refugees could not afford computers, tablets or internet access and did not have the language skills and computer literacy that were needed to access virtual care.",

More than 50% of our participants were from Ontario, the same province that receives more than 50% of refugees to Canada. A sensitivity analysis showed that Ontario is the most culturally and linguistically diverse province in Canada, has a significant Franco-Ontario population, and has special initiatives to resettle refugees in small and mid-size cities [24] . However, it is possible that Ontario refugee clinics may be more developed than other areas of the country. Participants self-identified and volunteered as eligible, and thus, this sample was not necessarily representative of all clinicians in Canada. Refugee and migrant access, isolation, and socioeconomic challenges may be context-dependent and dynamic throughout the pandemic. Virtual care is emerging as a powerful tool in primary health care, but we need to measure the equity of access, experiences, and effectiveness more precisely in front-line refugee and migrant care.",

Examples include loss of jobs and income, accenting stigma and structural racism and reducing community organization support. Virtual approaches to care have emerged as a promising new delivery tool that may eventually reduce barriers and cost to care but may demand strong global mental health skills. However, more research is needed to ensure equity of access to virtual services. This study of clinicians working with refugees across Canada shows the importance of advocacy and innovation in the context of social equity and trust during the COVID-19 pandemic. Access to primary mental health care remains vulnerable and may benefit from virtual care approaches; however, further research on effectiveness and equitable access is needed. ",
