            "text": "BrS is an inherited cardiac channelopathy that compromises ion channel integrity and leads to transmembrane current alterations in cardiomyocytes. The clinical significance of BrS is underscored by its association with ventricular fibrillation (VF) with progression to SCD. Its true prevalence is unknown, as a consequence of frequently being asymptomatic and thus underdiagnosed, but is estimated to be between 1:2000 and 1:5000, and is likely more common in Asian populations. 8 Although BrS exhibits characteristic ECG patterns, patients are often young, healthy and unaware of their condition until after a syncopal episode or sudden cardiac arrest. In fact, the peak presentation is said to be between 38 and 48 years of age. 9 ECG criteria for diagnosis include ST elevation and/or R\u2032 in V1-V3 followed by an inverted T-wave (Coved pattern-type 1) or by a Saddleback pattern (type 2). 10 The most commonly identified genetic lesion is a loss-of-function mutation in SCN5A, which encodes cardiac sodium channel alpha subunit Na V 1.5. 11 Many susceptibility loci have been identified in association with BrS, although SCN5A is the only gene classified as having definitive evidence as a cause for BrS. 12 The distinction between BrS and Brugada pattern (asymptomatic but with characteristic ECG findings) has important implications for patient management. Placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) is indicated in patients with BrS who have survived sudden cardiac arrest or have sustained VT, but individuals with BrS pattern and no signs, symptoms or family history of BrS do not benefit from a defibrillator. 13 Despite being asymptomatic, those who have Brugada pattern on ECG carry a risk of VF up to 12% at 10 years, so the clinical threshold to perform an ECG should remain low if there is any suspicion of BrS. 14 BrS is often elicited from various inciting stressors, such as fever, alcohol and certain medications, including those commonly used in critical care scenarios. Fever is a particularly well described variable in the aetiology and prognosis of BrS, with higher temperatures increasing the risk for cardiac arrest in BrS. [15] [16] [17] It is known that the biochemical capacity of cardiac sodium channels declines at higher temperatures, and, importantly, fever-exacerbated BrS appears to not be mutation-specific. 18 19 Our patient's DNA was not sequenced to determine his mutation status at the SCN5A locus, but it is noteworthy that some authors contend that even heterozygous carriers for the mutation can display meaningful pathology in the context of fever or other unmasking states. 19 COVID-19 is typified by the presence of fever, among a constellation of other constitutional and/or pulmonary symptoms, and thus can be an important risk factor in unmasking BrS. The severe inflammatory response frequently seen with COVID-19 can lead to fever-induced arrhythmias and, to some extent, dictate the prognostic outcomes. In our case it is notable that the patient was afebrile during the hospital stay.",

Given this patient's elevated inflammatory markers, one could surmise that even if this individual's fever was suppressed by antipyretics Case report like acetaminophen, the milieu of circulating cytokines such as IL-6 and other mediators (procalcitonin, ESR and so on) may contribute to the transient malfunctioning of the cardiac sodium channels, which precipitates Brugada pattern on ECG. Previous reports have noted that acetaminophen use in this context seems to reduce the risk for fever-induced cardiac arrest, but as is illustrated by our case, it remains unclear if antipyretic use has any effect on the development of Brugada pattern. 16 Despite this uncertainty, healthcare providers should be aware of this phenomenon and prioritise treatment of fever and avoidance of drugs that could provoke BrS, such as sodium channel blockers or tricyclic antidepressants, if characteristic ECG changes are recognised in the setting of COVID-19.",

For these asymptomatic patients with Brugada pattern on ECG without family history of SCD, syncope and ventricular tachyarrhythmias, there is no indication for treatment. 21 However, ICD placement may be considered if ventricular arrhythmia is induced during an electrophysiology (EP) study. In symptomatic patients (ie, those with sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias leading to syncope with type I Brugada on ECG or those with prior cardiac arrest), the recommendation is ICD placement. Certain patients may refuse ICD placement if he or she is not a candidate for the procedure (limited life expectancy or significant comorbidities); these individuals can be managed medically with antiarrhythmic therapy (ie, quinidine or amiodarone). Lastly, catheter ablation is also an option for those who fail antiarrhythmic therapy or continue to receive repeated shocks from ICD due to high burden of ventricular tachyarrhythmias. 22 23 Learning points \u25ba This is a classic arrhythmia that has been known to be exacerbated by fever. We have seen Brugada pattern with a number of COVID-19 cases and do not know the long-term cardiac risk factors in these patients. \u25ba These patients should be closely monitored on telemetry or in the intensive care unit if there is any respiratory compromise. \u25ba Fever should be adequately treated and make sure to rule out other infectious aetiologies. \u25ba There are no indications for invasive interventions in asymptomatic individuals with Brugada pattern on ECG, unless there is a family history of channelopathies, syncope or sudden cardiac death, or if a ventricular arrhythmia is induced during an electrophysiology study.",
