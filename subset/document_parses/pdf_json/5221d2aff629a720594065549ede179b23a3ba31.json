In this instrument validation study, a total of 310 individuals (253 female, 57 males), with a mean age of 25.96 \u00b1 6.29 years were included. The questionnaire consisted of 4 parts, comprising the sociodemographic characteristics, CUDQ, caffeine withdrawal symptoms, and caffeine consumption. For the evaluation of the data, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), descriptive statistics, and the t test were used. In the reliability analysis, the Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficient was 0.86, and the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.83 for CUDQ. The CMIN/df was 0.54, and the model generally fits well to the structure (RMSEA = 0.08, CFI = 1, NFI = 1, GFI = 0.99, AGFI = 0.99, TLI = 1, NNFI = 1, RFI = 0.98). The findings suggested that the CUDQ has validity of structure, internal consistency, and construct validity for assessing Caffeine Use Disorder the tendency in the Turkish adult population.",

            "text": "The potential health consequences of the intake of caffeine are the subject of scientific research. There are several statements from health authorities (e.g., European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), Health Canada, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)) that the general population of healthy adults are not at risk for the potential side effects of caffeine (Verster & Koenig, 2018) . According to comprehensive research on caffeine safety, it has been shown that a caffeine intake of up to 400 mg per day for healthy adult individuals is not associated with adverse side effects (Nawrot et al., 2003; Rotstein et al., 2013) . The EFSA has confirmed that an average daily intake of 400 mg of caffeine for an adult does not cause side effects (Agostoni et al., 2015) . Epidemiological studies support the fact that moderate caffeine intake plays a beneficial role in reducing the risk of several chronic diseases (Parkinson's disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney disease, and cognitive disorders), but it should be noted that excessive intake could possibly be harmful to at-risk groups (children, adolescents, pregnant, and/or lactating women) (Grosso et al., 2017; Poole et al., 2017; Reis et al., 2019; Seifert et al., 2011; Srithongkul & Ungprasert, 2020) . Although the short-term effects of caffeine on health (acute elevation of blood pressure, stimulation of the central nervous system, increased metabolism, etc.) are well known, the long-term effects, depending on the amount, are not yet clear (Daneschvar et al., 2020; Grosso et al., 2017; Higdon & Frei, 2006) . Caffeine is being studied specifically for its effects on alertness and cognitive performance. However, in some people, if consumed late in the day, it can have a dose-dependent negative effect on sleep (Lieberman et al., 2019) . The positive effects of caffeine consumption are mainly related to psychomotor speed, but it is suggested the withdrawal reversal mechanism in individuals who habitually consume caffeine. Since caffeine acts as a stimulant, its psychoactive effects and withdrawal symptoms when it is not used by habitual users make them mandatory (Luciano et al., 2005) .",

(2011) of the different sizes of the widely sold beverage. The questions asked how many of each size were consumed daily by those who completed the questionnaire. The question was: \"What is the average number of each drinks that you consumed last month?\" For example, if you drank cola, how many 250 cubic centimeter (cc) drinks, 160 cc drinks, 250 cc drinks, 330 cc bottles, or 500 cc drinks did you consume every day on average? Then, the total was calculated according to the amount consumed in cc and the amount of caffeine in each beverage. Following this, the consumption amounts of the foods that contain caffeine were asked about in terms of the number of grams. Caffeine amounts were calculated using the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) International Nutritional Composition Database, and the products measurements were based on studies on the labels and caffeine contents of foods (Fredholm et al., 1999; USDA accessed, 2021) .",

The frequency distributions and descriptive statistics of the demographic information of the individuals participating in the research are given in Table 1 . The majority of the sample was female (81.6%), and 79.0% of the individuals were single. The mean age of the individuals was 25.96 \u00b1 6.29 years, and the mean body mass index (BMI) was 23.23 \u00b1 9.95 kg/m 2 . The fit indices of the CUDQ, which was adapted to Turkish, were calculated as a result of CFA. In CFA, the chi square goodness of fit index was calculated as 18.829 (df = 35, P = 0.988). The other goodness of fit indices comprised the following: CFI = 1, GFI = 0.99, AGFI = 0.99, TLI = 1, NNFI = 1, RFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.000, and SRMR = 0.05. According to the CFA findings, the Turkish adapted CUDQ was highly consistent in terms of validity (Mulaik et al., 1989) . Table 2 shows the results of the descriptive analysis for the sub-items of the CUDQ and the Cronbach alpha reliability analysis of the CUDQ. According to these results, the item with the highest average was CUDQ3, and the item with the lowest average was CUDQ1. As a result of the reliability analysis, the adjusted correlation lower and upper limits were given for the items of the caffeine consumption scale, and all of the corrected correlations of these items were positive. The intraclass correlation coefficient of the scale was 0.83, and the Cronbach alpha coefficient was 0.86. In addition, since no increase in the reliability coefficient was observed when an item was removed, no item was excluded from the caffeine consumption scale. According to the ICC and reliability coefficients, it was concluded that the caffeine consumption scale was highly reliable in terms of internal consistency. Table 3 shows the item-based CFA for the CUDQ. According to the CFA findings, all of the items were grouped under 1 dimension in a statistically significant way (p < 0.05). Table 4 shows the CUDQ score results for the caffeine withdrawal symptoms. According to these findings, 31.3% of the individuals had headache, 31.9% had fatigue and constant sleepiness, 21.9% had depression or restlessness, 28.7% had a lack of concentration, 11.6% had flu-like symptoms, and 11.6% experienced inconvenience or suffering in daily life. In addition, the CUDQ scores of the individuals who experienced caffeine withdrawal symptoms were significantly higher than those without symptoms (p < 0.05). Figure 1 shows the average caffeine intake of the participants from caffeinated foods and drinks. Table 5 shows the relationship between the total CUDQ score and the caffeine intake of individuals from caffeinated foods and drinks. There was a statistically significant relationship between the total scores of the CUDQ and the caffeine intake of individuals from caffeinated foods and drinks (p < 0.05). A positive and low relationship was found between the total score of the CUDQ and caffeinated beverages (r = 0.35) and caffeinated foods (r = 0.14). In addition, the correlation coefficient between the total score of the CUDQ and total caffeine intake was statistically significant (p < 0.05). A positive and low level (r = 0.35) correlation was found between the total score of the CUDQ and total caffeine intake. In other words, as the CUDQ scores increased, the individuals' daily caffeine intake increased, and vice versa. ",

The Turkish form of the scale was sent online to adult individuals, and the data obtained from the 310 individuals were analyzed. In this study, the findings suggested that the model for CUD was psychometrically robust. The level of internal consistency among the items of the CUDQ, item total correlation numbers, and Cronbach alpha internal consistency coefficients were examined, and the internal consistency coefficient of the scale was accordingly found to be 0.874. The Cronbach alpha coefficient comprises a value between 0 and 1. Approaching a value of 1 indicated that the scale was perfectly good. In addition, the correlation of all of the items with the total score was positive and above 0.50. This indicated that the scale was able to measure CUD fear as a whole. As a result, the findings allowed for the conclusion that the CUDQ presented sufficient empirical evidence of reliability and validity to support its use in the context presented in this study. The Cronbach alpha coefficient for the original scale was 0.87 (\u00c1goston et al., 2018) .

The findings also indicated that the scale had a reliability coefficient that was over 0.70, which met the criterion of acceptable reliability recommended that was determined by Nunnally (Nunnally & Bernstein, 1978) Caffeine consumption is a socially acceptable activity, and its increasing consumption has caused it to become a part of our daily lives. Today, the introduction of new caffeinecontaining food products and changes in consumption habits of more traditional caffeine sources have increased overall caffeine consumption and potential cumulative effects (Temple et al., 2017) . High caffeine consumption can have significant public health impacts. Therefore, it is not surprising that caffeine has aroused the interest of researchers and clinicians (Nieber, 2017) . There is no agreement about the real health danger upon caffeine regular consumption (Addicott, 2014) . However, for some individuals, the use of caffeine can interfere with the fulfillment of obligations or cause interpersonal problems. As these 2 criteria are the most severe, it is highly recommended to examine possible manifestations in clinical studies. Therefore, the Turkish version of the CUDQ as a whole may be the subject of further studies to distinguish latent continuity from CUD with low persistence and mild symptoms.",

The concurrent validity of the CUDQ showed significant correlation with caffeine withdrawal symptoms. In addition, the CUDQ scores of the individuals who experienced caffeine withdrawal symptoms were significantly higher than those without symptoms. Therefore, it was thought that CUD may increase psychiatric disorders and associated symptoms. Similar to this study, in other studies, CUD was found to be associated with symptoms such as headache, drowsiness, fatigue, depressed mood, sleep, and wakefulness (Budney et al., 2015; James & Keane, 2007; James & Rogers, 2005; Meredith et al., 2013) .",

In this study, the relationship between general caffeine use and the CUDQ was investigated. In future studies, the consumption of different caffeinated products can be examined separately. In addition, the groups of caffeine consumers should be investigated, while considering both the amount and type of caffeine consumed in the development of CUD, as well as the role of various demographic variables (e.g., socioeconomic status, educational status).",

First, in the study population, the females were quite overrepresented. Second, the findings of this study were based on self-report data which has the risk of source bias. In further research, it could be used the multiple methods of assessment (e.g., experimental paradigms, clinical administration). Third, the sample power analysis result evaluated in this study was sufficient, but the data collection occurred online. The data were collected during the initial COVID-19 pandemic; hence, to minimize the risk of infection, the data collection occurred online. Proper sampling may be limited in terms of the ability to access all layers of the population (for example, individuals without the internet). Its suitability for use in clinical and research settings (it via other modes of administrations, such as clinical administration and/or face-to-face verbal interviews) and more diverse populations, including clinical samples, should be examined further in future studies. However, online data collection methods tend to give more honest and truthful results than offline methods (Griffiths, 2010) . Finally, this study calculates the criterion validity and test-retest. In conclusion, the findings of this study provided evidence that the CUDQ has validity of structure, internal consistency, and construct validity for assessing CUD. Further studies could determine the tendency of individuals in the adult Turkish population towards CUD, and it could be applied to different groups.",
