This may be due to the fact that the RV is present throughout the year regardless of specific seasonality. 11, 12 Although being historically related to the common cold and to mild respiratory illness, [13] [14] [15] recent data suggest that RV can be related to more severe cases. 16 According to Cohen et al. it was the principal agent of SARI during a hospital surveillance period 2009-2012 in South Africa, where 74% were PLWH 9 and also an important agent in elderly hospitalized with SARI in Chile 17 as well as the causal agent of more severe cases requiring ICU treatment, in codetection with S. pneumoniae. 18 Most of our cases were found in co-detection with another agent suggesting that RV may contribute to more severe cases but the possibility of only being a bystander cannot be rule out in this context. In accordance to our findings, HMPV remains an infrequent cause of SARI even in PLWH. 19 Apart from viral detection, S. pneumoniae is reemphasized as the main bacterial pathogen found in patients with CAP who presented with SARI, regardless of the CD4 lymphocyte count as shown by L opez-Aldeguer et al. 20 Another important aspect of our study was the fact this pyogenic bacterium was found in patients with late onset of symptoms (non-SARI) and three out of seven patients presented with bacteremia and all three of them died, a feature often correlated with poor prognosis. 21 L. pneumophila remains an uncommon cause of community-acquired lung infection but we acknowledge that some cases might have been missed since the urinary antigen test can only detect type 1 infections and up to 14 days of onset. 20, 22 We found a high frequency of Mtb in patients with few days of symptoms and in a population with a previous history of pulmonary or disseminated TB, suggesting that prolonged immunosuppression may reactivate the bacillus. [22] [23] [24] Our findings are in agreement with Coelho et al. who showed that TB was the most common opportunistic infection in the total cohort followed at our center. In high TB prevalence settings, such as the one observed in our context, this diagnosis should be pursued in PLWH regardless of symptom duration. 25 Another important aspect of our findings was to emphasize the polymicrobial aspect of respiratory infections in this population.

Similar findings were found by Almeida et al. in 49 PLWH admitted with pneumonia in an emergency department with a median CRB65 score lower then HIV-negative patients but which were also associated with a higher risk of mortality. 37 In the paper of Yone et al., 54 out 62 PLWH admitted with community acquired pneumonia (CAP) had CRB65 of 0-1. 38 In our study, adding the pulse oximetry to CRB-65 score, as suggested by the Consensur II, the Latin America Pneumonia working Group, increased the ability to confidently predict the 30-day in-hospital mortality. 39 In the context of SARI surveillance target at influenza, a possible explanation for our late detection relies on the fact that immunosuppressed and critically ill patients there seems to be prolonged viral shedding. 40 The median CD4 cell count in this study population was 80 (24-274) cells/mm 3 and the proportion of patients with undetectable viral load was 25% despite 80% being exposed to ART. Compared to the whole cohort followed at our center for the period 2012-2013, where 69.5% were male and the median age was 42.5 years, the median CD4 cell count was higher (542 cells/mm 3 ), and so was the proportion who had undetectable HIV viral load (69.5%) and ever being exposed to ART (90.8%). 41 This shows that the population in this study is severely immunocompromised and found it harder to adhere to ART at the time. We observed two cases of influenza in the non-SARI group, respectively 20 and 30 days after symptom onset, and both patients developed respiratory failure that led to death (data not shown). This highlights the fact that immunosuppressed PLWH with respiratory symptoms may not seek hospital attention in time to be captured by SARI surveillance.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 134, "end": 136, "text": "29", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 278, "end": 280, "text": "30", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 281, "end": 284, "text": "32,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 285, "end": 287, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 354, "end": 356, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 631, "end": 633, "text": "6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 634, "end": 637, "text": "35,", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 638, "end": 640, "text": "36", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1136, "end": 1138, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1250, "end": 1252, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1466, "end": 1468, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1687, "text": "40", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2168, "end": 2170, "text": "41", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Finally, regarding symptom frequency, we found a low percentage of sore throat, runny nose and conjunctivitis and a high percentage of dyspnea, diarrhea, and myalgia.
