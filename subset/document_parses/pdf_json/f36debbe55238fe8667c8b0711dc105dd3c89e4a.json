We here present a temporal metabolic response to mRNA COVID-19 vaccination in oncology patients undergoing standard of care FDG PET. Methods 262 oncology patients undergoing standard of care FDG PET were included in the analysis. 231 patients had at least one dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine while 31 patients had not been vaccinated. The SUVmax of the lymph nodes ipsilateral to the vaccination was compared to the contralateral to obtain an absolute change in SUVmax (\u0394SUVmax). Results \u0394SUVmax was more significant at shorter times between FDG PET imaging and COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, with a median \u0394SUVmax of 2.6 (0-7 days), 0.8 (8-14 days), and 0.3 (> 14 days), respectively.

            "text": "With rapid and widespread rollout of the mRNA COVID-19 vaccinations [BNT162b2 (Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine) and mRNA-1273 (Moderna vaccine)], transient increased 2-deoxy-2[ 18 F]fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) uptake in normal or enlarged ipsilateral axillary, supraclavicular, and cervical lymph nodes after vaccination has been reported in patients undergoing positron emission tomography (PET) examinations [1, 2] . This vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy may create FDG PET/CT interpretation challenges, particularly in cancer patients, affecting assessment of cancer staging and treatment response. While vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy has been described with other vaccines such as influenza [3, 4] , vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy appears to be more prominent with mRNA COVID-19 vaccines. The mRNA COVID-19 vaccines are reported to be more immunogenic than traditional vaccines [5] , which may influence the extent and duration of vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy on imaging. Recent literature has shed light on the confounding effects of vaccine-induced lymphadenopathy and proposed timelines for consideration of performing PET/CT examinations in relation to COVID-19 vaccine administration. However, the timeline of response and the associated differences in maximum standardized uptake value (\u0394SUVmax) between ipsilateral vaccinated axillary/subpectoral lymph nodes and contralateral lymph node chains is relatively unknown. The goal of this study is to examine the temporal impact of COVID-19 vaccine on the \u0394SUVmax results obtained from FDG PET/CT and FDG PET/MRI scan in patients who received at least 1 dose of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine compare compared to those that did not receive an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine.",

Information regarding COVID-19 vaccine manufacturer, date of vaccination, site of administration, and patients symptoms (current and at time of vaccination) was collected via intake questionnaires given to patients by technologists performing the scan. Patient age, sex, race, and blood sugar at time of FDG PET were obtained from the medical record as well as the type of cancer and treatments. The study has been approved by the institutional review board, (IRB # 21-001818) and all subjects provided verbal consent and the need for written informed consent was waived. Visual and semi-quantitative analysis of metabolic response to the mRNA COVID-19 vaccine was determined by two board-certified nuclear radiologists.

Ipsilateral lymph node size and SUVmax were compared to the contralateral axillary/sub-pectoral lymph node chains to obtain an absolute difference in SUVmax (\u0394SUVmax). \u0394SUVmax was calculated as the SUVmax in the vaccinated arm for vaccinated patients (or either arm for the not vaccinated patients)-SUVmax in the contralateral arm. All tests were two-sided with p value < 0.05 considered statistically significant. To account for multiple comparison, Bonferroni correction was used for the pairwise comparison between different time intervals.

Time between COVID-19 vaccine and PET scan was associated with statistically significant changes in \u0394SUVmax but remained greater than non-vaccinated patients at all time points. \u0394SUVmax was greater at shorter time intervals between the dates of the COVID-19 vaccination with a median \u0394SUVmax of 2.6 (0-7 days), 0.8 (8-14 days), and 0.3 (> 14 days), respectively ( Fig. 1 and Table 2 ).

            "text": "Based on previous experience with routine vaccinations, vaccine-related nodal FDG uptake typically occurs within 7 days of vaccination and generally subsides by 12-14 days [7] . Studies have suggested performing PET/CT at least 2 weeks after vaccination in cancer patients for which interpretation is anticipated to be potentially impacted by the vaccination, though some have suggested to wait 4-6 weeks after vaccination [1] . Our data demonstrate a progressive decrease in SUV max after the first week from vaccine, and the lowest \u0394SUVmax being seen after 2 weeks from vaccination, with non-substantial changes between patients waiting either > 2 weeks or > 4 weeks after vaccination. However, it should be noted that even after 2 weeks, there is a statistically significant \u0394SUVmax for vaccinated patients compared to non-vaccinated patients, with a few outlying patients demonstrating markedly increased FDG uptake (Fig. 1 ). This is in line with the reported late-term metabolic response (7-10 weeks) after mRNA vaccination [8] . It has been postulated that symptomatic patients would have a greater radiographic response. However, our results demonstrate that self-reported symptoms do not affect the likelihood of having metabolically active nodal findings. Additionally, it should be noted that the vast majority of patients that received the vaccine did not have lymphadenopathy > 1.0 cm on the short axis despite many having increased FDG uptake (Fig. 3) . This discrepancy between metabolic response (FDG PET) and lymphadenopathy has been previously reported and can be considered a hallmark of mRNA vaccination response and may help guide the interpreting physician to distinguish between a pronounced COVID-19 vaccination response and true nodal metastatic disease [9] .",
