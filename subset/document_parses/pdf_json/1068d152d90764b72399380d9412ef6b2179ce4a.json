In a randomized clinical trial, we compared dichoptic movies, streamed at-home on a handheld 3D-enabled game console, versus patching as amblyopia treatment. Sixty-five amblyopic children (3-7 years; 20/32-125) were randomly assigned to one of two parallel arms, binocular treatment (3 movies/week) or patching (14 h/week). The primary outcome, change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at the 2-week visit was completed by 28 and 30, respectively. After the primary outcome, both groups of children had the option to complete up to 6 weeks of binocular treatment. At the 2-week primary outcome visit, BCVA had improved in the movie (0.07 \u00b1 0.02 logMAR; p < .001) and patching (0.06 \u00b1 0.01 logMAR; p < 0.001) groups. There was no significant difference between groups (CI 95 %: \u2212 0.02 to 0.04; p = .48). Visual acuity improved in both groups with binocular treatment up to 6 weeks (0.15 and 0.18 logMAR improvement, respectively). This novel, at-home, binocular movie treatment improved amblyopic eye BCVA after 2 weeks (similar to patching), with additional improvement up to 6 weeks. Repeated binocular visual experience with contrast-rebalanced binocular movies provides an additional treatment option for amblyopia.",

With as little as 9 h of viewing time, mean improvement of visual acuity of the amblyopic eyes was 1.5 to 2.0 lines 1, 2 . While these laboratory studies provided proof-of-principle data for the treatment approach, at-home treatment is a more practical alternative. More recently, both a single arm study and a randomized clinical trial allowed children to view cloud-based movie content at home using a head-mounted display (a commercially available smartphone in a virtual reality headset) with reduced fellow eye contrast, reporting a mean visual acuity improvement of 1.5 \u2212 1.8 lines within 12 weeks 3, 4 . However, headmounted displays are difficult to use by preschool children because of their size and weight, as well as the visual isolation imposed during wear. Additionally, while there is an objective log time during which movies were streamed, the headset makes it impossible for a parent to periodically check whether the child has their eyes open while the movies are playing.",

Eighteen popular animated feature films were modified using custom MAT-LAB software to allow dichoptic presentation on a New Nintendo 3DS XL platform (Nintendo Corporation, Kyoto, Japan), which was loaned to the child for the duration of the study so that movies could be watched at home. This Nintendo device allowed for dichoptic viewing without the need for anaglyphic, polarized, or shutter glasses or a VR headset. The movies had the same design as in our recent prospective study of contrast-rebalanced movies in which children came into the laboratory to watch movies on a passive 3D display 1,2 . Briefly, odd lines in the Nintendo 3D display were visible to one eye, and even lines were visible to the other eye. A patterned image mask composed of irregularly shaped blobs was multiplied with the images seen by the amblyopic eye, and the inverse patterned mask was multiplied with the images seen by the fellow eye, so that different parts of the display were seen by each eye. Blobs of the movie seen by the amblyopic eye always had high contrast (100%), whereas the complementary blobs seen by the fellow eye had reduced contrast. Because the blobs had Gaussian edges, the edges of the blobs overlapped and were seen by both eyes with differing contrasts, preventing any significant rivalry. The shape and location of the blobs were varied dynamically every 10 s. Fellow eye contrast started at 20% for the first movie and incremented by 10% for each subsequent movie (i.e., 20%, 22%, 24%, 26%, 29%, \u2026). Movies were uploaded to our Amazon Web Services (AWS; Seattle, WA, USA) streaming service in two-week packets, each containing 6 movies that preserved the order of fellow eye contrasts from low to high.",

Children assigned to the dichoptic movie arm were asked to watch 3 movies per week (about 4.5 h per week) during each 2-week period, based on the 4-5 h per week used in our previous contrast rebalanced binocular treatment studies and randomized treatment trials 1, 2, [8] [9] [10] . During their visit, we provided a link on their loaned Nintendo for the set of 6 movies that should be watched during the next two weeks. Movie names were numbered on the Nintendo device, in order by fellow eye contrast, and the family was instructed that the movies should be viewed in that order at home with the date recorded on a paper log sheet. The log sheet had pictures of the title frames from each of the 6 movies with a space next to each for the parent to write in the date it was watched. Fellow eye contrast of movies 1-6 incremented from 20 to 32% during the first 2 weeks, movies 7-12 incremented from 35 to 57% during weeks 3 and 4 and, finally, movies 13-18 incremented from 63 to 100% if children participated in the optional weeks 5 and 6. Children assigned to the patching arm were supplied with patches and asked to patch two hours per day for two weeks.

Crowded monocular best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was tested using the Amblyopia Treatment Study HOTV protocol for 3-to 6-year olds (N = 37) [11] [12] [13] and the E-ETDRS protocol for 7-year olds (N = 16) [14] [15] [16] . A few of the youngest children who were unable to complete ATS-HOTV were tested with Allen Pictures on the Mentor Baylor Visual Acuity Tester II (BVAT-II; Mentor Ophthalmics, Inc., Norwell, MA, USA; N = 7). Whichever visual acuity test was used for baseline assessment was also used at all follow-up visits. Stereoacuity was assessed with the Randot Preschool Stereoacuity Test and the Stereo Butterfly Test [Stereo Optical Inc, Chicago, IL] 17 ; stereoacuity was converted to log arcsec for analyses; nil stereoacuity was arbitrarily assigned a value of 4.0. Extent of suppression was assessed using the Worth-4 dot test at 7 distances (3 m, 2 m, 1 m, 0.67 m, 0.5 m, 0.33 m, and 0.16 m) 18 ; the farthest distance at which the child reported 4 dots was converted into the area of suppression scotoma in log degrees. Depth of suppression using a dichoptic eye chart that identifies the non-preferred eye/preferred eye contrast ratio (i.e., balance point) at which the child can overcome suppression and report letters presented to each eye with equal likelihood (Contrast Balance Index; CBI) 19, 20 .",

Exploratory analyses were conducted to determine whether the improvement in visual acuity at the 2-week visit was associated with the child's baseline visual acuity, baseline stereoacuity, or their response to conventional treatment with glasses and patching prior to enrollment. Response to conventional treatment was categorized as \"responded to treatment\" if visual acuity improvement \u2265 0.1 logMAR occurred with glasses and patching over two or more visits prior to enrollment. Children were classified as having had \"no prior response\" to conventional treatment if there was no improvement in visual acuity over two visits separated by at least 8 weeks.",

Not all participants attended clinical visits at all time points.

In these young children, contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies are as effective as patching. Therefore, dichoptic movies could offer a break from patching without stalling progress or risking recurrence, and thus provide a second option for children who are or have become noncompliant with patching. The mean BCVA improvement at the 2-week visit was modest at 0.07 logMAR, but continued visual acuity improvement was observed with use of contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies for 6 weeks, for a mean improvement of 0.15 \u2212 0.18 logMAR. After 6 weeks of viewing contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies at home, 29% of children in the dichoptic movie group had \u2264 0.1 logMAR (\u2264 1 line) interocular difference in visual acuity (recovered). These results are similar to those reported in a recent randomized trial of 4-to 7-year-old using a head-mounted display to view dichoptic movie content at-home as a treatment for amblyopia 4 . Additionally, a modest improvement in stereoacuity was observed in the dichoptic movie group at the primary outcome and 4-week visit. Reports of stereoacuity improvements with other dichoptic therapies for amblyopia in children are variable, with some reporting improvement [22] [23] [24] [25] and others reporting no change 4, 26, 27 . The factors that contribute to this variability in stereoacuity outcomes of binocular treatment remain to be determined. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ In the movie group, but not in the patching group, children who had a clinical history of no visual acuity improvement in response to treatment with glasses and patching had a larger visual acuity improvement at the 2-week primary outcome visit than children who previously had responded to treatment with glasses and patching. This could reflect better adherence to binocular treatment in the setting of a randomized clinical trial than adherence to patching prior to enrollment or, alternatively, may result from individual differences in treatment efficacy of binocular versus patching treatments 28 .",

This may have been a consequence of broader inclusion criterion, which included children with baseline amblyopic eye visual acuity of 0.2 logMAR. Including milder amblyopia in the at-home study may have allowed less room for visual acuity improvement than in the in-lab study. The at-home study also included a much smaller proportion of children with baseline amblyopic eye visual acuity of > 0.7 logMAR than the in-lab study (12% vs 30%), further limiting the maximum amount of improvement that could be observed. Other factors that may have contributed to differences between the two studies include attention to the movies in-lab compared to at-home and the better quality of the larger passive LG Electronics (Englewood, NJ, USA) monitor used in-lab compared to the image of the handheld Nintendo device used for at-home viewing.",

Dichoptic movies and videos, then, may provide an advantage over games in ease of use for the youngest children who may benefit from early treatment of amblyopia 5, 6 . Use of a 3D display to separate images for each eye, rather than a head-mounted VR headset, may provide advantages for young children who find the headsets uncomfortable due to their size and weight size and weight, and may dislike the visual isolation imposed during wear. Additionally, headset wear makes it impossible for parents to watch the movie with their child or even check whether their child has their eyes open while the movies are playing.",

            "text": "Limitations of the study include the short duration of randomly assigned treatment (2 weeks), followed by a crossover. Nonetheless, groups had continuing gains in BCVA throughout their 6-8 weeks in the study and the gains in BCVA were comparable to those reported for young children in randomized clinical trials of patching and binocular games that included a spectacle adaptation period of \u2265 8 weeks 27, [32] [33] [34] . Another limitation of the study is the use of three different visual acuity tests. While most participants were tested using the ATS-HOTV protocol, 7 of the youngest participants were tested with Allen pictures, which may overestimate visual acuity compared to letter optotypes 35 , and 16 of the oldest participants were tested with the E-ETDRS protocol, which may have a slight bias toward worse performance of amblyopic eyes than ATS-HOTV in children 36 . Regardless, the same visual acuity test was repeated at each child's visit, allowing determination of changes in BCVA relative to baseline. A limitation of presenting contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies on a handheld device is that any particular hardware may become obsolete in a few years. Nonetheless, there are many potential devices for presenting dichoptic movies. For this study we chose to use an inexpensive device familiar to children, the New Nintendo 3DS XL, but the same approach could be easily transferred to other hardware platforms. Another limitation is the lack of objective monitoring of adherence for both patching and the movie treatment, instead, relying on parental written logs in this study. This limitation is typical of randomized clinical trials designed to evaluate the effectiveness of prescribed treatments rather than their efficacy 33,37-41 . Overall, this novel, at-home, binocular movie treatment was effective in improving amblyopic eye BCVA, with additional improvements observed with up to 6 weeks of treatment. Repeated binocular visual experience with contrast-rebalanced dichoptic movies provides an additional treatment option for amblyopia. www.nature.com/scientificreports/",
