How it persists in the population and defies existing herd immunity is unknown. Here we focus on viral glycoprotein S, the target for neutralizing antibodies, and provide an in-depth analysis of its antigenic structure. Neutralizing antibodies are directed to the sialoglycan-receptor binding site in S1 A domain, but, remarkably, also to S1 B . The latter block infection yet do not prevent sialoglycan binding. While two distinct neutralizing S1 B epitopes are readily accessible in the prefusion S trimer, other sites are occluded such that their accessibility must be subject to conformational changes in S during cell-entry. While nonneutralizing antibodies were broadly reactive against a collection of natural OC43 variants, neutralizing antibodies generally displayed restricted binding breadth. Our data provide a structure-based understanding of protective immunity and adaptive evolution for this endemic coronavirus which emerged in humans long before SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "C oronaviruses, enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses of mammals and birds, pose a considerable zoonotic threat, as poignantly illustrated by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, long before the emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in 2019, four other CoVs arose from cross-species transmission to become established in the human population. NL63 and 229E are alphacoronaviruses in the subgenera Setraco-and Duvinacovirus, respectively. These viruses use bats as a natural host reservoir 1 , although the presumptive immediate ancestor of 229E is a virus natural to dromedary camels. HKU1 and OC43, like SARS-CoV-2, are in the genus Betacoronavirus but grouped in another subgenus called Embecovirus. Embecoviruses are found in large abundance in muroids and, from this natural reservoir, spilled into a variety of other mammals including livestock and companion animals. Whereas the origin of HKU1 is unknown, OC43 presumably arose from a relatively recent cross-species transmission of bovine coronavirus (BCoV). According to molecular clock analysis, the OC43-BCoV split was estimated to have occurred some 130 years ago [2] [3] [4] , whereas the most recent common ancestor of all extant OC43 variants was dated to the 1950's [3] [4] [5] .",

Indeed, despite high seroprevalence levels already seen in children [10] [11] [12] , reinfections occur as soon as 6-8 months after the previous infection [13] [14] [15] . How HCoVs manage to do so is not known. Protective immunity is thought to be conferred predominantly by neutralizing antibodies directed against the spike (S) proteins, homotrimeric assemblies that mediate receptor-binding and membrane fusion during entry. Recent computational analyses revealed that specific regions of the 229E and OC43 S proteins are under strong positive selection indicative of adaptive evolution. In accordance, phylogenetic trees estimated for these S proteins have ladder-like topologies with long trunks and short terminal branches consistent with antigenic drift as a mechanism of immune escape 16 . In further support of this view, antisera raised against older strains of 229E are less effective in neutralizing contemporary field variants 17 . However, the epitopes and functional activities of neutralizing antibodies against the S proteins of the endemic human coronaviruses remain poorly defined. Understanding the molecular basis of viral neutralization by antibodies and the identification of key viral epitopes is essential to understand humoral immunity against the endemic HCoVs and to comprehend not only how they managed to colonize humans as a novel host but also how they escape herd immunity to persist in the population.",

Its trimeric spike structure has recently been resolved in complex with its sialoside receptor 18, 19 . Similar to other coronaviruses, the spike monomers are composed of two functional subunits-S1 and S2 that mediate binding to the host cell and fusion of the viral and cellular membranes, respectively. The N-terminal S1 subunit contains four core domains (S1 A through S1 D ) of which S1 A (also known as N-terminal domain or NTD) interacts with 9-O-acetylated sialic acids as the entry receptor 18, 19 . While the S1 B (a.k.a. C-terminal domain or CTD) of other coronaviruses may be involved in binding to protein receptors, no function has been attributed to this domain for OC43 [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Three copies of the S2 subunit, which contains the fusion peptide, can mediate viral fusion and cell entry. Despite the common presence and clinical significance of OC43, knowledge on the spike antigenic structure of this human pathogen is lacking.",

To define neutralizing epitopes on the OC43 spike protein, we used an earlier established panel of hybridoma's generated from spikeimmunized H2L2 mice 26, 27 . These transgenic H2L2 miceencoding chimeric immunoglobulins with human variable heavy and light chains and murine constant regions-had been immunized with the trimeric spike ectodomains (S ecto ) of three human-infecting betacoronaviruses OC43, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The OC43 spike antigen used for mice immunization was from the prototype laboratory strain discovered in 1967 (USA/1967 strain) that was passaged several times in human embryonic tracheal organ culture, in suckling mouse brain, and in cell culture 3, 28, 29 , and which is the only strain that can be grown in tissue culture cells. We screened OC43 S ecto -reactive H2L2 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs)-using the hybridoma supernatants (75 in total), or upon mAb purification from cultured and cloned hybridoma's (49 in total)-with respect to spike domain specificity, ELISA-based affinity and pseudovirus neutralizing activity, as well as the competitive binding profiles of S1-directed neutralizing antibodies by biolayer interferometry (BLI) (Fig. 1a-c, Supplementary Fig. 1a-f ). Of the 49 H2L2 antibodies, 22 mAbs displayed neutralizing activity with epitopes in S1 (21 in total: 4 bound to S1 A and 17 to S1 B domain) and S2 (1 in total). Nine neutralizing antibodies directed against OC43 S1 were prioritized for in depth characterization and, prior to further analysis, reformatted to fully human IgG1 antibodies by cloning the genes of the variable region of light and heavy chains into mammalian expression vectors encoding the human constant regions. We evaluated these human antibodies for neutralization activity against VSV-based pseudovirus on HRT-18 cells (Fig. 2a) . High neutralization potency was observed for mAbs 41F12 and 46C12 (IC 50 values 0.005 and 0.004 \u03bcg/ml, respectively), followed by mAbs 43E6, 47C9, 37F1, 40D11 and 56E10 (IC 50 values ranging between 0.013 and 0.029 \u03bcg/ml). Lower neutralizing potency was seen for 45B9 (IC 50 : 0.646 \u03bcg/ml) and 65A11 (IC 50 : 0.116 \u03bcg/ ml). Neutralization assays performed with authentic OC43 virus (USA/1967 strain) yielded similar results (Fig. 2a) . Two of the nine mAbs recognized epitopes in the S1 A domain (41F12 and 46C12) and the remaining seven in S1 B (43E6, 47C9, 37F1, 40D11, 56E10, 45B9, and 65A11) as demonstrated by ELISA using different OC43 spike antigen forms (Fig. 2b) . To further characterize the antigenic sites on the OC43 S protein, we performed a BLI-based cross-competition binding assay with OC43 S1 protein-coated sensors (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Fig. 2 ). The levels of binding competition, ranging from maximal to nondetectable, allowed us to divide the S1 neutralizing antibodies into five distinct antibody competition groups, corroborating the competition groups observed for the H2L2 antibodies (Supplementary Fig. 1f ). Group I antibodies included S1 A -binding antibodies 41F12 and 46C12; group II to V comprise S1 B -binding antibodies 43E6 and 47C9 (II), 37F1 and 40D11 (III), 56E10 and 45B9 (IV), and 65A11 (V). Group I, II, and III mAbs are noncompeting with each other. Group IV and V mAbs have a more miscellaneous competition profile and show (partial) binding competition with mAbs from other groups. The binding kinetics of each of the nine mAbs were evaluated by BLI using OC43 S1 monomer as a substrate, revealing K D values in the nanomolar range (3.4-46.1 nM) (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

Lower part: cryo-EM structure of the trimeric OC43 S ectodomain (PDB: 6NZK) in transparent surface mode. The S protein trimer is composed of three S1 subunits that forms the membrane distal 'head' and three S2 subunits that constitutes the membrane proximal central 'base'. Ribbon structure of one spike protomer is shown, with S domains colored as in schematic. The other two protomers are shown in light gray.

The paratope comprises the CDRL1 and 2 loops, and the CDRH3 loop. The 46C12 epitope overlaps with the binding site for the sialoglycan receptor ( Fig. 3a-c) . Of note, the CDRH3 loop projects into the receptorbinding pocket on OC43 S, presumably preventing interaction of the sialoside receptor. The sidechain of L103, similarly to N-acetyl methyl of the receptor, projects into the P2 pocket of the receptor-binding site. The backbone amide of L103 forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl group of S1 A residue K81, similarly to the 5-nitrogen atom of 9-O-Ac-Sia. Moreover, K81 also forms a salt bridge with CDRH3 residue D104, reminiscent of the interaction formed by the 9-O-Ac-Me-Sia C1-carboxylate. Collectively, this demonstrates that 46C12 occludes the sialic acid-binding site through molecular mimicry.",

We subsequently tested antibody ELISA-reactivity to a panel of seven S1 A mutants with single-site alanine substitutions of residues known to be critical for sialoglycan-receptor binding 18, 19 . Binding of all four neutralizing S1 A antibodies was abrogated by the K81A substitution, which for 46C12 is consistent with the notion that K81 in S1 A forms a salt bridge with D104 in the CDRH3 loop of 46C12 (Fig. 3c, e, Supplementary Fig. 5 ).

They share functional activity and apparently prevent virus infection by blocking virus attachment to host cells through competitive binding to the sialoglycan-binding site.",

Because the region of S1 B targeted by 37F1 is poorly resolved in previous OC43 spike structures 18 , we generated an S1 B homology model and docked this into our cryo-EM reconstruction ( Fig. 4e and f ).

In contrast to S1 A -mAbs, none of the seven tested S1 B -directed neutralizing mAbs exhibited HAI activity.

We identified a total of 127 peptides suitable to monitor deuterium uptake in free S1 versus the Fab-bound complexes, covering 76% of the sequence overall, 81.3% of the S1 B domain ( Supplementary Fig. 12 ). Protected regions were found for all three S1-Fab complexes, all mapping to the S1 B domain ( Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Based on the deuterium uptake patterns found in overlapping peptides, the protected regions in the S1-45B9 complex were narrowed down to residues 399-406, 417-421, and 537-547. A single protected region was found in S1-56E10, corresponding also to residues 537-547, consistent with competition binding between 45B9 and 56E10. In the S1-65A11 complex, we found protection from deuteration in residues 361-371 and 399-406. All regions protected by 45B9, 56E10, and 65A11 map to regions of the S1 B domain that are indeed shielded in the structure of the closed OC43 spike trimer (Fig. 5a, b) .

The S1 B -reactive mAbs 43E6 (group II) and 37F1 (group III) were included as binding controls ( Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 14) . F420S and K543A-and to a lesser extent F420A-abolished 45B9 binding indicating the importance of F420 and K543 to antibody recognition, further supported by their close proximity on the S1 B domain surface (Fig. 5d , e). Likewise, K538 was critical to binding by 56E10, as K538A eliminated 56E10 binding. Binding by 65A11 was lost by the G404R substitution, and impaired by the G404S and R405A mutations, indicating the importance of these consecutive spike residues for mAb binding.

Perhaps most surprisingly, P35S was identified as a common resistance mutation for antibodies that target non-overlapping epitopes in S1 separated by a considerable distance in the native S conformation. The P35S mutant and other mutations (P33L, P34L, and P35F) that emerged under antibody selection are part of a triple proline motif ' 33 PPP 35 ' in USA/1967 located downstream of the L1 loop ( 27 NDKDTG 32 ) 18 in S1 A that constitutes the rim of the receptorbinding site, and forms part of the structurally defined 46C12 epitope ( Supplementary Fig. 19a and c) . Whereas neutralization escape to S1 A -directed 41F12 (group I) by P35S (and P35F) is rationalized by a diminished antibody binding affinity to its target, the occurrence of P35S in the OC43 S trimer distal to the S1 B residing epitopes of 56E10/45B9 (group IV) and 65A11 (group V) antibodies implicates an allosteric immune evasion mechanism, in which S1 A -related conformational changes during entry may affect accessibility of neutralizing S1 B epitopes. S1 neutralizing antibodies are affected by genetic diversity in OC43 strains. Phylogenetic analysis to evaluate the diversification of US/Eurasian OC43 field variants and the evolution of the spike gene, in particular, suggested a split before 1967 into main groups A and B, and revealed the emergence and disappearance of major and minor S lineages over the last six decades (Fig. 7a,  Supplementary Table 2 ). Plotting the naturally occurring S protein sequence diversity onto the spike structure showed that the variation coincided with the positions of the neutralizing epitopes of the structurally characterized Fabs (Fig. 7b, Supplementary  Fig. 18b ). The epitopes of 46C12 and 37F1 exhibit the greatest sequence variability (Fig. 7b) . In contrast, the epitopes of the domain-occluded epitope regions contacted by 56E10, 45B9, and 65A11 exhibited a higher degree of conservation among OC43 isolates (Fig. 7b) . Sequence alignments show that the sialoside receptor-interacting residues in the L1 and L2 loops are well conserved across OC43 spike proteins of naturally occurring OC43 strains (Supplementary Fig. 19a and c) . However, considerable sequence variation is found in the periphery of these receptor-interacting residues in L1 and L2, as well as the binding site supporting L3 loop ( 257 NSKLTL 262 ) and include mutations that were selected by the S1 A -directed mAb 41F12 (Supplementary Fig. 19a and c) . Moreover, residues that are under positive selection also localize to the L1 to L3 loops that collectively compose the sialic acid binding site 18, 31, 32 . High level of sequence variation is also found in S1 B2 subdomain containing the neutralizing epitopes of S1 B -directed antibodies ( Supplementary  Fig. 19b, d and e) . Particularly, the tip of B2 containing the 37F1 neutralizing epitope is characterized by three loops (K 494 -G 505 loop, D 523 -L 525 loop, and P 528 -T 536 loop) that harbor significant levels of single-site amino acid mutations as well as two naturally occurring Indels, in K 494 -G 505 loop (Indel3) and T 527 -T 536 loop (Indel4) and four residues that are under positive selection ( Supplementary Fig. 19b and d) . In addition, a loop containing region (D 461 -D 476 ) in B2 that composes a central part of the 47C9 mAb epitope-shows significant level of sequence variation as well as two residues that are under positive selection (Supplementary Fig. 19b and e) .",

To increase the throughput of the experiment, we tested ELISA binding at one concentration for each antibody. The heatmap showing the ELISA binding values (OD 450nm ) displays notable differences in the cross-reactivity profile for neutralizing and non-neutralizing antibodies (Fig. 7c) . Cross-binding capability towards S1 of OC43 strains was dominant among non-neutralizing antibodies. All 18 nonneutralizing antibodies-with sole exception of 44H8-were broadly reactive, recognizing the S1 antigens of each of the six selected clinical isolates. In contrast, among the 21 neutralizing S1 antibodies, only 56E10 and 45B9-both targeting an occluded epitope-recognized all six strains. Cross-reactivity for the other neutralizing mAbs (group I, II, III, and V) was largely restricted to the USA/1990(B) and USA/2016 strains that are representatives of S lineages B and A-I, and virtually absent against S1 antigens from the other selected strains.",

The findings show that the neutralizing epitopes in S1 of the OC43/USA/1967 prototype strain are poorly conserved even in its closest relatives within the Betacoronavirus-1 species. Conversely, most of the non-neutralizing epitopes were conserved at the species level, but, with few exceptions, not in members of other embecovirus species, and not in all members from other Betacoronavirus subgenera. Thus, serological cross-reactivity across embecoviruses at the level of the S protein may be largely based on a limited number of subgenus-wide conserved nonneutralizing epitopes.",

Antigenic mapping of the neutralizing antibodies revealed multiple sites of vulnerability on the spike protein of this endemic coronavirus. The combined structural and in vitro data demonstrated the presence of three nonoverlapping neutralizing epitopes on the surface of the prefusion S trimer, represented by the 46C12, 43E6, and 37F1 epitopes. The S1 A -directed neutralizing antibodies recognize the S1 A receptor binding site for 9-O-Ac-Sia and directly block virus binding to sialoglycans by preventing virion-ligand interaction. These findings are in line with previous observations that attachment to sialoglycans is critical for OC43 infection. Surprisingly, however, most neutralizing mAbs were directed not against S1 A but against the S1 B domain, and, whereas in S1 A we identified only a single neutralizing epitope, four distinct epitopes were found in S1 B , two of which surface-exposed in the closed prefusion S trimer conformation, the others hidden. The S1 B -directed antibodies neutralize OC43 infection via an unknown mechanism, independent of sialoglycan receptor binding inhibition, because none of them prevented virion attachment to 9-O-Ac-Sia. The presence of multiple, non-overlapping sites of vulnerability in S1 B suggests a crucial role of this domain in entry not appreciated before. Such a role may involve the inhibition of spike conformational changes that lead to entry, or, alternatively, interactions with a putative, second receptor. This latter scenario has been proposed for the related HCoV HKU1, based on the observation that preincubation of cells with purified S1 B blocks HKU1 cell entry and that mAbs targeting the tip of this domain neutralize infection 34, 35 .",

Alternative spike conformations for OC43, however, have not been captured thus far by cryo-EM 18, 37 . The occluded binding sites of these neutralizing antibodies nevertheless can be taken as an indication for conformational flexibility of the OC43 spike protein (e.g. during virus entry) which leads to the exposure of the cryptic neutralizing epitopes in S1 B . The masked nature of the epitopes is further supported by the identification of mutations in the S1 A receptor binding domain that provide neutralization resistance to all three S1 B -directed 56E10, 45B9, and 65A11, suggesting that the antibody escape mechanism may be allosteric and conceivably related to receptor binding induced conformational changes.",

In contrast to non-neutralizing antibodies, the neutralizing antibodies tend to have restricted binding specificity indicating antigenic variability in neutralizing epitopes on spike proteins. The structurally defined, accessible neutralizing epitopes on the prefusion OC43 spike trimer strikingly map to regions of high sequence variability across OC43 isolates, indicating that these antigenic sites of OC43 are tolerant of amino acid substitutions and frequently occurring insertions/deletions that restrict antibody binding breadth, which is a commonly found evolutionary signature in viral glycoproteins under immune selection 38, 39 . Much of the antigenic variation in the OC43 spike protein residues in the receptor-binding area. While the sialoglycan receptor-interacting residues are functionally conserved, we observed significant sequence variation in other regions of the receptor-binding motif across OC43 isolates, including the identified antibody escape mutations that conferred neutralization resistance. Similar observations have been made for influenza virus 38 , as well as for some coronaviruses that interact with protein receptors SARS-CoV-2 and 229E [40] [41] [42] . Apart from the strain diversity in the receptor-binding motif, a significant part of sequence variation is concentrated in the B2 subdomain of S1 B , which overlaps with the neutralizing epitopes of group II and III mAbs rationalizing the observed diversity in binding breadth of the isolated neutralizing antibodies.

A split to have occurred before 1967 gave rise to two major OC43 clades with S types provisionally designated A and B. The type A subsequently diverged into several co-evolving lineages, the most populous ones tentatively designated A-I through A-III (Fig. 7a) , with progressive intra-lineage accumulation of mutations in neutralization epitopes. Intriguingly, clade B and lineage A-II S types seem to have gone extinct in the early 2000s and to have been displaced largely by A-I-and A-III-type spikes, which emerged around that same time and representatives of which still dominate the field to date as based on the frequency of isolation and widespread geographic occurrence. Komabayashi et al. 44 from their longitudinal study on the occurrence of OC43 between 2010 and 2017 in Japan noted that viruses from different genotypes but with either A-I or A-III type S proteins (corresponding to their groups B and D, respectively) seemed to yearly alternate in the population. The combined observations of us and others indeed would support a model for the continued persistence of OC43 in the human population facilitated by alternating re-infections with antigenically distinct co-circulating OC43 variants and short-lived or incomplete humoral immunity in the population. More research is needed to monitor genetic diversity and evolutionary dynamics of OC43 and other endemic human coronaviruses, and to study the impact of antigenic changes in evading host immunity and in driving viral epidemics. The neutralizing epitopes on OC43 S, identified here, provide a structural framework to understand the adaptive evolution of the endemic OC43 coronavirus in response to humoral immunity, and are instructive for the development of pharmaceutical interventions. Moreover, our findings may be predictive of the long-term antigenic evolution of SARS-CoV-2 which emerged in humans only since late 2019 but that is projected to become endemic.",

Recombinant OC43 S ectodomain and S2 ectodomain were transiently expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified from culture supernatant using streptactin beads (IBA) following the manufacturer's protocol. The genes encoding OC43 S1 subunit (amino acid 1-752), S1 A (amino acid 1-306), S1 BCD (amino acid 303-753), S1 B (amino acid 331-602) and S1 CD (amino acid 303-330-Gly Ser linker-611-753) were cloned in-frame in pCAGGS mammalian expression vector C-terminally extended with a thrombin cleavage site followed by the Fc region of human IgG, and were transiently expressed in HEK-293T cells and purified from culture supernatant using Protein A sepharose (IBA) according to the manufacturer's instruction. All recombinant OC43 variants were generated using the same strategy. Genes encoding the S1 subunit of the OC43 isolates (amino acid 1-759, strain: NL/2004, GenBank: OK245433 and amino acid 1-758, strain: NL/2019, GenBank: OK245434) were amplified by RT-PCR from viral genome, genes encoding S1 of the OC43 isolates (BE/2004; GenBank: AAX84792.1; USA/1990(B); GenBank: AGT51461.1; USA/1990(A-II); GenBank: AGT51690.1, USA/2016; GenBank: AVQ05264.1) were synthesized by GenScript USA Inc. and the sequences were codon-optimized to maximize expression in the HEK-293T expression system.

            "text": "Hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry. For the initial peptide identifications, 3 \u00b5l of OC43 S1 (99 pmol) expressed from HEK293 GnTI\u2212/\u2212 cells were diluted in 38 \u00b5l of 100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0 and mixed with 20 \u00b5l quench solution consisting of 6 M Urea and 300 mM TCEP, pH 2.5. Directly after mixing the sample with quench solution, the complete volume of the sample was manually injected into a 50 \u00b5l sample loop of nanoACQUITY UPLC System with HDX technology (Waters Corp., USA). The protein was loaded onto the immobilized pepsin column (2.1 \u00d7 30 mm, NovaBioAssays, USA) for digestion (20\u02daC) followed by in-line trapping (0.5\u00b0C) of the formed peptic peptides on the Waters Van Guard TM BEH C18 trap column (300 \u00c5, 1.7 \u00b5m, 2.1 \u00d7 5 mm) for 3 min at 125 \u00b5l/min. Peptic peptides were separated with Waters Acquity UPLC BEH C18 analytical column (1.7 \u00b5m, 1.0 \u00d7 100 mm) with 15-min gradient from 8 to 95% B, where A is 0.1% formic acid and B is 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile. Separated peptides were analyzed with XEVO G2 mass spectrometer (Waters Corp., USA) using MSE data acquisition with 6 V fixed collision energy during the low energy scan and 10-35 V ramped collision energy applied during the high energy scan. Cone voltage was set to 40 V. The data was acquired in resolution mode within 50-2000 m/z range. The peptide identification measurements were performed in triplicate. Peptides were identified with Waters PLGS 3.0.1 software (digestion was set to non-specific, methionine oxidation, N-glycans, and O-glycans were set as variable modifications) and processed with Waters DynamX 3.0 (minimum intensity was set to 1000, minimum four amino acids were considered as a peptide, peptide was present in two out of three PLGS files). After this initial filtering peptides were visually inspected and selected for spectrum quality, omitting peptides with wrongly assigned charge states and interfering signals. The final OC43 S1 sequence coverage was 76% covered by 127 peptic peptides. These peptides were followed in hydrogen deuterium exchange reactions. In each hydrogen deuterium exchange reaction, 2 \u00b5l of OC43 S1 (66 pmol) were incubated either with 1 \u00b5l of buffer (100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) or with 1 \u00b5l of Fabs (200 pmol of either 56E10, 45B9 or 65A11 Fabs) for 1 h at room temperature to form S1-Fab complexes. These mixtures were diluted 13-fold into 100 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, pD 8.0, 95% D 2 O and quenched with 20 \u00b5l of 6 M Urea, 300 mM TCEP, pH 2.5 at 10 s, 1 min, 60 min, and 240 min time points. All measurements were performed in triplicates. The deuterium uptake of the peptides from unbound OC43 was compared to the deuterium uptake of peptides originating from S1-Fab complexes in DynamX 3.0. No back-exchange corrections were conducted due to identical conditions for all performed experiments and deuterium levels were given as a relative deuterium uptake. The statistical analysis of deuterium uptake differences was performed with Deuteros 2.0 59 .",

Rooted phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA X software 60 from a final collection of 124 North American/Eurasion sequences (see Supplementary Table 2 ) by using the neighbor-joining method with bovine coronavirus S as outgroup. Bootstrapping was performed for 1000 replicates, and evolutionary distances were computed using the Kimura 2-parameter method. Branches were re-ordered from top to bottom based on collection date with the year of isolation indicated by color-coding in a sidebar to visualize S evolution among and within distinct S lineages.",
