The purpose of this was to ideally prevent the spread of the virus, or at least to slow the spread, a process known as flattening the curve 7 . However, strategies such as social distancing have impacted economies globally and economic worries are causing countries to consider lifting measures earlier than epidemiologists recommend 8 . There are worries that this may cause a second wave of infections, as seen historically in other pandemics 9 . Multiple governments are starting to release de-confinement strategies, for example the state of New York 10 , British 11 , and Dutch 12 governments have detailed plans to ease restrictions. However, they only concern populationlevel effects of likely disease spread and contain no information on how an individual's risk impacts their likely morbidity and mortality if they were to contract the virus. Research has shown that COVID-19 does not impact all ages and sexes equally 13 and as such a more personalised risk assessment can aid in improving outcomes. In a recent BMJ editorial 14 , the authors conclude that the COVID-19 response \"is about protecting lives and communities most obviously at risk in our unequal society\".

This allows us to overcome the previously identified shortcomings of previous COVID-19 prediction papers by reporting according to open science standards and implementing widespread external validation. To overcome the shortcoming of using small data for development, we made use of the abundant data from patients with influenza or flu-like symptoms to develop the models and then we tested whether the models transport to COVID-19 patients.
