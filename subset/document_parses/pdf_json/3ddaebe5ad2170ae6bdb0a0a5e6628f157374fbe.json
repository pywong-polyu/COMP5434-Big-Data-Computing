            "text": "A field study collecting behavioral data was conducted to investigate effects of behavioral interventions, commonly known as nudges, in promoting the consumption of organic fruits and vegetables. Consumption, both organically and conventionally produced fruits and vegetables, was measured in a grocery store during 4 days (1 day every other week) where consumers were exposed to informational messages in combination with either emotional images or social norm messages. Measurements of daily consumption without exposure to nudges were carried out during four other days (1 day every other week, alternated with the nudging days). The results showed no effect of the nudging strategy; instead, it pointed to the importance of the price as a determinant of buying decisions. Buying ecological alternatives was associated with lower price differences between the ecological and non-ecological alternatives. We conclude that combined nudges and collected psychological data from participants may contribute to more successful nudging interventions. Some political measures in balancing the price difference between organically and conventionally produced products might also be interesting strategies in order to promote the consumption of organic fruits and vegetables.",

More strict standards for products to be labeled as organic may offer a guarantee to consumers that the chosen products are truly organic and may have contributed to the increasing consumption. The overall aim of the organic agriculture is to sustain or improve the health of the soil and the ecosystem from the smallest organisms in the soil to human beings. According to the review of Brantsaeter et al. (2017) , pesticide residues exposure is clearly lower with organic foods as compared with conventional foods, but the potential specific impact of this difference on human health is still unclear. This positive impact on health of the soil and the ecosystem, influenced by organic food, highlights the need of behavior change toward an increased consumption of organic food products. In fact, the focus on the climate impact of food consumption is increasing, and the recent April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 720606 Weimer et al.",

This means, by changing the layout of the store or the order of the placement of food in a cafeteria, \"choice architects\" may influence peoples' behavior. These perspectives of the environment or elements of behavior architecture have been named \"nudges\" and are designed based on insights from cognitive and social psychology and lately behavioral economics. Nudges rely on the idea of choice architecture that may include changes in infrastructure or the environment that guide and enable individuals to make choices almost automatically. Accordingly, nudges do not try to change one's value system or increase information provision. Instead nudges focus on enabling behaviors and individual decisions for the benefit of private and often public interests (Kahneman, 2011) .",

However, as the implementation of nudges as a public policy instrument has increased, so has the critical voices. Present multidisciplinary perspectives on the ongoing nudging debate are dominated by three assumptions: nudges are a simple and effective means for steering individual choices; they are easily implemented in public policy; and but they represent a possible threat to autonomous decision making . Based on research examining nudging from the perspectives of behavioral-, philosophical-, and political science, de Ridder et al. (2020) argue that none of these assumptions have strong support. Rather, they suggest that nudges are more legitimated than expected, nudges may increase autonomous decision making and that the implementation of nudges are far from easy.",

While the fast system is guiding large parts of our daily behaviors, which we do routinely, almost automatically, e.g., taking a walk, driving the car, and buying our daily food, the slow system relies on a much greater deliberate mental effort when we need to make decisions about important choices in life. That means that the fast system relies on heuristics (rules of thumb), mental shortcuts, and biases, while the slow system is governed by reflective and conscious processes and uses detailed multi-criteria cognitive evaluations, e.g., when people buy a house or choose a new job. According to Kahneman (2011) and Thaler and Sunstein (2008) , an application of nudging is based on automatic, intuitive, and unconscious processes. This automatic way of making decisions may be described as cognitive and/or affective taskrelevant processes that take place outside conscious awareness and guide large parts of our daily behaviors, that is, those things which we do routinely, almost automatically.",

Instead, nudge means carefully guiding people's behavior in desirable direction and arranges the choice situation in a way that makes the desirable behavior to the easiest or most attractive option. Nudges may be appropriate when choices have delayed effects, when they are complex or infrequent and thus, learning is not possible, when feedback is not available, or when the relation between choice and outcome is ambiguous, as suggested by Thaler and Sunstein (2008) . Many situations in everyday life do not require active decision-making choices; instead, it is more appropriate to speak of routine or habitual behaviors. As about 45% of our everyday actions are behaviors that are not actively reflected upon (Verplanken and Wood, 2006) , nudges may likely be appropriate for both routine behaviors and complex decisions that require more of people's cognitive capacity than is manageable in daily life (Lehner et al., 2016) .",

Based on the insight that the amount, accessibility, and complexity of information provided to people affect the outcomes of decisions, nudging builds on presenting a more simple and straightforward information in order to promote a desirable behavior. Simplification in combination with framing, a conscious phrasing of the information, may also encourage decision making by activating people's values and attitudes (Lehner et al., 2016) . Simplified information tailored to specific choice situations increases the likelihood of influencing individual consumers in making certain information more salient. A recent study showed that grocery shoppers base their choices in supermarkets on a small number of salient factors. The more important were price (for 46% of respondents) and health (36%), but they can be modified depending on the choice context (Kalnikait\u0117 et al., 2013 ). An example of information simplification and framing is food labeling. Focusing on health and environmental aspects of food, a design of a \"traffic light system\" of information provision can be a successful strategy to frame the consumer decision in line with learned-in reactions to traffic lights (i.e., red is bad; green is good; Sacks et al., 2009 ). However, the efficacy of the traffic lights strategy depends on the degree of self-control of the consumers. Koenigstorfer et al. (2014) showed that traffic lights labeling only helped consumers with low self-control to reduce their food purchasing behavior.",

Changed accessibility, presentation, proximity, and visibility of food have significant impact on the type and amount of food consumed (Lehner et al., 2016; van Gestel et al., 2020) . One way to nudge people into buying certain products is to place these products on shelves at the eye level. Also, products that are situated closest to cashier are the ones that are often sold (Goldberg and Gunasti, 2007) . Another nudging tool, to do changes in the default policy, is based on the fact that most people prefer not to act, unless they have to, and that most people tend to postpone their actions, to procrastinate. For that reason, they are easily influenced by defaults, standard choices, which determine the result in case people take no action. For example, a single-sided print option is a default which contributes to much higher volumes of paper than if default would have been double-sided copy. Egebark and Ekstr\u00f6m (2016) demonstrated in a Swedish study that 30% of paper consumption is determined by the default and that by switching the default options paper consumption could be reduced by 15%. Defaults have also been used in food research; a study by Loeb et al. (2017) shows that parents select healthier breakfast options for their children when they are readily available (v. only available on request).",

The descriptive norms, on the other hand, point to how most people behave (the \"normal\" way), thus giving the individual a benchmark on how to best act in a particular situation. The norm must be salient, visible, to the individual in order to exert influence on behavior (Cialdini and Goldstein, 2004) . In a well-known study, Goldstein et al.

Therefore, in order to test, if the choices done (ecological alternative or not) could be predicted from the experimental conditions (control or nudging weeks), we run logistic regressions for each product. As there was a great variability in the prices, namely, comparing each week the ecological and the classical alternative, unit price for each product sold (ecological alternative or not) was also used as a predictor variable. Three of the products (broccoli, apple, and iceberg lettuce) were not sold in organic alternatives during the data collection period; therefore, the analyses were only run for the remaining six products.",

In fact, apparently, it was the other way around. Except the missing results for spinach, lemon, rucola, and carrot, sales of ecological tomatoes and pepper decreased comparatively in the nudging weeks. However, this is an illusory result. As it can be seen in Table 2 , the unit price of ecological pepper was almost twice the price of the non-ecological alternative in weeks of both control-and nudging condition during the first 4 weeks (Moment 1). Therefore, it is not so strange that in the nudging weeks of Moment 1, the selling of (less expensive) non-ecological pepper was more than three times higher than the number of ecological pepper. The same phenomenon was observed during the last 4 weeks of the study (Moment 2) with a higher unit price of the ecological pepper, especially during weeks of control condition, resulting in more than three times higher selling of non-ecological pepper. Regarding tomatoes, the selling of ecological tomatoes is lower during weeks of nudging condition in both Moment 1 and Moment 2 with a higher unit price compared to non-ecological tomatoes. Only in the control condition during Moment 2, where no price difference between the ecological and the non-ecological products exists, almost three times higher sales of ecological tomatoes can be found.",

One may consider that consumers with limited budgets are more likely to be hindered from consuming organic food and for this reason organic food may be offered in schools and housing for elderly as a green public policy. Such type of government subsidies should cause only limited social consequences as pupils in schools and elderly in public housing in Sweden anyway receive most of their food for free. However, there is a need of further research to examine whether different public subsidies will have the desired impact in terms of consumption, environment, and social inequality. The public could also provide more consumer information about price gaps, costs of organic production, and benefits of organic food in order to promote organic consumption (Aschemann-Witzel and Zielke, 2017) .",

A consequence of this method was that sometimes there were significant price differences between the organic product and the correspondent non-organic one. This difference, which was almost always in the direction of organic products being more expensive, could be as high as 2.5 times. Therefore, when analyzing the results, we had to take price differences in consideration. In future studies, it would be of interest to seek appropriate agreements in advance with food store owners in order to apply all relevant tools for nudging in interventions, and, if possible manipulate the price of some products in order to do comparisons with similar prices.",

In general, a considerable potential of nudging in food consumption has been found in laboratory experiments, whereas nudging experiments in real life are less controllable and have so far shown more limited success. This may be due to the opposing power of marketing together with the varying reactions of individuals as discussed by Lehner et al. (2016) . The advantages of a field study, however, can be attributed to a high external validity with the associated possibility to generalize the result to other situations in real life.

It may be considered a limitation that no participants were identified in the current study but the ambition was to carry through the study without disturbing the everyday trade in the store and to be close to the normal reality and increase ecological validity of the study. This strategy finds support in the review of Broers et al. (2017) where they report difficulties in keeping track of participants in field studies. Nudging interventions usually last for several days where it is often unclear how to collect data from a varying number of participants and observations. It is only possible to measure the actual behavior when participants are tracked (anonymously) which could make them more aware of the intervention and block the automatic and intuitive way of reacting to the nudge (Broers et al., 2017) . Nevertheless, in order to achieve a better insight in the desired and sustainable behavior, future nudging studies should include a sample size of identified participants (Broers et al., 2017) . Also, Vandenbroele et al. (2020) are pointing out that recent studies have not been able to obtain significantly beneficial results from only changing the choice architecture and therefore refer to personal predispositions toward sustainable consumption in designing nudging interventions. Another interesting approach would be the use of robotadvising tools. The use of smartphones is very widespread in many countries, and the possibility of nudging through automatic messages directed to the consumers (and based on their usual consummation) is a promising new strategy. For example, D' Acunto and collaborators (D' Acunto et al., 2020) have used robot-advising nudges to change social norms about peer's consumption behavior. It is an encouraging way to reduce the efficacy of the automatic heuristic decision strategies by the application of algorithmic solutions (e. g. D' Acunto et al., 2019) .",

The intervention in a grocery store revealed no effects of nudging, indicating that consumers tended to buy more organic products in case these products were less expensive or only slightly more expensive than conventional products. The price as a well-known barrier to purchase of organic food is discussed together with some measures that can be taken to compensate for the prevailing differences in price between organic and conventional products. Applying a combination of all available nudging tools to strengthen its effects and collecting psychological data from the participants to be aware of their attitudes toward choices of organic products were suggested. These actions should be taken in order to compensate for the grocery stores as environments with low levels of control due to many competing marketing factors, and in future studies, achieve more strong effects of nudging in promoting the consumption of organic fruits and vegetables.",
