[1] [2] [3] Despite high overall response rates (ORRs) with these agents, complete remissions (CRs) are rare, and treatment is typically continued indefinitely until disease progression. Another potential target in the BCR pathway is spleen tyrosine kinase. Among patients with relapsed/ refractory CLL, monotherapy with a selective spleen tyrosine kinase inhibitor, entospletinib, yielded an ORR of 61.0%; in a cohort that previously failed BTK and/or phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitors, ORR was 32.7%. 4, 5 However, responses were mainly partial, and no CRs were reported. Combinations of targeted agents may deepen responses, shorten treatment duration, and possibly reduce dosages, improving tolerability.",

In a phase 1 trial, tirabrutinib was well tolerated in relapsed/refractory mature B-cell malignancies. 6 The ORR in the CLL cohort was 96% but most did not attain CR. 6 Among patients with relapsed/refractory CLL, tirabrutinib plus entospletinib proved safe and tolerable in a phase 1b trial, with an ORR of 100%. Most patients did not attain CR, and none achieved undetectable minimal residual disease (uMRD). 7 This phase 2 trial compared combinations of tirabrutinib and entospletinib with and without obinutuzumab (TEO/TE) in relapsed/refractory CLL. Methodology is provided in the Suppl. Information. After 6 patients were enrolled in the TE arm, a protocol amendment directed that all subsequent patients be enrolled in TEO due to low CR rates in the preceding phase 1b trial. 7 A similar phase 2 trial with combinations of tirabrutinib, idelalisib, and obinutuzumab will be reported separately.",

The best rate of uMRD in peripheral blood was 0 for TE and 43.3% for TEO, while best rates of uMRD in bone marrow were 0 and 6.7% for TE and TEO, respectively (Suppl. Table S2 ). The course of minimal residual disease (MRD) results in bone marrow and peripheral blood for TEO and TE are shown in Suppl. Figures S3 and  S4 . Five of 13 patients who achieved uMRD in peripheral blood with TEO became MRD positive again afterwards. MRD was also assessed by next-generation sequencing (NGS) in peripheral blood as an exploratory analysis (Suppl. Figure S5 ). In the TEO arm (n = 29), a decrease in MRD was observed for most patients at week 25; however, none had uMRD by NGS with a 10 \u22126 cutoff. For patients who had an additional assessment at the end of treatment or 6 months after, further decreases in MRD were observed, with 2 patients reaching uMRD at end of treatment. For 2 of 3 patients who reached uMRD at week 25 by flow cytometry, MRD remained detectable with the more sensitive NGS method (Suppl. Figure S6) . Improved CR and uMRD results have been achieved with combinations including B cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitors. Ibrutinib plus venetoclax showed an ORR of 89% with a CR rate of 51% and a uMRD rate of 53% in blood and 36% in bone marrow after 12 months of therapy. 12 Acalabrutinib plus obinutuzumab resulted in 4 of 22 relapsed/refractory patients who achieved partial response attaining bone marrow MRD negativity at 12 months. 13 Within the CLL2-BIG trial, an increase of uMRD in the peripheral blood from 47.5% at the end of 6 months of induction therapy to 71.2% after up to 24 months of maintenance therapy was observed. 11, 14 This observation suggests that primary endpoint evaluation in this trial may have been premature. While MRD rates improved overall beyond week 25, improvement of CR rates could not be detected, since later computerized tomography scan or bone marrow biopsies were not required per protocol. It is possible CR rates may have been higher than observed.",
