            "text": "Aim The coronavirus disease 2019 has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths, impacted the flow of life and resulted in an immeasurable amount of socio-economic damage. However, not all of this damage is attributable to the disease itself; much of it has occurred due to the prevailing misinformation around COVID-19. This rapid integrative review will draw on knowledge from the literature about misinformation during previous abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks to enable policymakers, governments and health institutions to proactively mitigate the spread and effect of misinformation. Subject and methods For this rapid integrative review, we systematically searched MEDLINE and Google Scholar and extracted the literature on misinformation during abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000. We screened articles using predetermined inclusion criteria. We followed an updated methodology for integrated reviews and adjusted it for our rapid review approach. Results We found widespread misinformation in all aspects of large-scale infectious disease outbreaks since 2000, including prevention, treatment, risk factor, transmission mode, complications and vaccines. Conspiracy theories also prevailed, particularly involving vaccines. Misinformation most frequently has been reported regarding Ebola, and women and youth are particularly vulnerable to misinformation. A lack of scientific knowledge by individuals and a lack of trust in the government increased the consumption of misinformation, which is disseminated quickly by the unregulated media, particularly social media. Conclusion This review identified the nature and pattern of misinformation during large-scale infectious disease outbreaks, which could potentially be used to address misinformation during the ongoing COVID-19 or any future pandemic.",

COVID-19 was first reported in December 2019 and has since evolved into the sixth large-scale worldwide outbreak of the twenty-first century following the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2002 (Felter 2020) . Estimates suggest that COVID-19 is nearly twice as contagious as the seasonal flu and takes much longer to present symptoms, making transmission of the virus through asymptomatic carriers a substantial public health challenge (Tosta 2020) . Given the lack of widespread use of a safe and effective vaccine against COVID-19, public compliance with measures, such as physical distancing, hand hygiene and wearing masks, is essential to intercepting transmission links (Cheng et al. 2020) . Dissemination and consumption of clear, consistent and credible information about COVID-19 is a prerequisite to public compliance with these preventative measures (Van den Broucke 2020).",

            "text": "Both the dissemination and consumption of information have spiked since the COVID-19 pandemic (Zarocostas 2020) . During the Munich Security Conference in February 2020, the Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO) urged, 'we're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic\" (World Health Organization 2020). Infodemic is short for \"information epidemic', depicting the rapid spread and amplification of vast amounts of valid and invalid information (Okan et al. 2020) . The Internet, social media and other communication platforms have eroded traditional vertical health communication strategies by allowing misinformation to horizontally diffuse faster than ever before (Wang et al. 2019; Cuan-Baltazar et al. 2020) . The infodemic makes it difficult for the public to comply with public health measures, as it can debilitate individuals' ability to distinguish mis-and disinformation from fact and cause false perceptions of true risk, including both a higher perceived risk and a false sense of safety (Van den Broucke 2020; Okan et al. 2020) . The spread of misinformation can also incite fear and panic, which has been found to induce mistrust in government and non-government institutions leading the pandemic response and further increase susceptibility to misinformation, conspiracy theories and rumours (Wang et al. 2019) . Examining the past spread of misinformation during large-scale disease outbreaks can inform initiatives to tackle the spread of misinformation during the COVID-19 pandemic and ultimately improve public compliance with essential preventative health measures. We conducted a rapid integrative review to quickly synthesize existing literature about misinformation during recent abrupt large-scale infectious disease outbreaks, which we hope will enable policymakers, governments and health institutions to proactively mitigate the spread of misinformation during the current pandemic.",

This rapid integrative review primarily followed the integrative rapid review methodology developed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005) with adjustments suggested by other authors for a rapid review (Khangura et al. 2014; Tricco et al. 2015) . As integrative reviews synopsise previous scientific literature to obtain a comprehensive concept of a particular research topic (Broome 2000) , this approach has been deemed best fitting for this review.

Moreover, grey databases also help extract unpublished or in-progress studies. We selected Google Scholar, which is very commonly used to capture grey literature and can extract studies indexed in other databases as well (Haddaway et al. 2015; Vaska et al. 2019) .

Among recent large-scale infectious outbreaks, Ebola was the most commonly studied in the literature for misinformation. Women and young people were reported to be more prone to believing and passing on misinformation. Anxiety, worrying and a lack of experience in the scientific field was associated with the consumption of misinformation. Mass media, particularly social media, was largely found to contribute to the dissemination of misinformation. A lack of government efforts and a lack of trust in government efforts were also found to contribute to the spread of misinformation. Misinformation is not only an issue during large-scale infectious disease outbreaks; the advent of the Internet and social media have exacerbated the creation and dissemination of misinformation in all areas of health (Chou et al. 2018) . Social media feeds are closed networks curated to individual beliefs that amplify misinformation by creating 'information silos' and 'echo chambers'. From dangerous rumours about vaccines (Dub\u00e9 et al. 2014; Ortiz-S\u00e1nchez et al. 2020) , tobacco products (Albarracin et al. 2018) , alternative therapies (Wilson 2002; Schmidt and Ernst 2004) , and weight loss cures (Dedrick et al. 2020 ) to skepticism about medical guidelines (Fiscella et al. 1998) , there is an ever-growing need to curb misinformation.",

These findings may indicate two things. First, social media is increasingly playing the prime role in spreading health-related misinformation, as the use of social media has become ubiquitous and the influence of social media has risen to the extreme lately (Laranjo et al. 2015) . As Ebola was one of the most recent large-scale, deadly and long-lasting outbreaks before COVID-19, coupled with the growing influence of social media, concern around misinformation regarding Ebola was discussed most often. Second was the relation of health and science literacy and lack of trust in governing bodies with the spread of misinformation (Chou et al. 2018) . Ebola was mainly spread in West Africa, where studies Less biological science exposure Koralek et al. 2016 Training/occupation (arts and management sciences compared to medical, education, engineering, and other sciences occupation/professions)",

            "text": "A proactive, solution-oriented approach that dissects the different levels of misinformation and how each arises is essential to developing feasible steps to overcoming misinformation. Wardle and Derakhshan (2017) discussed the three elements involved in the creation, production, distribution and reproduction of misinformation, namely agent, message and interpreter (Fig. 2) . The results of our study can be approached using this model of misinformation to identify areas for intervention. We found that agents and interpreters during both the creation and production phases included family and friends, who are often perceived as a trusted source in the absence of authoritative sources (Balami and Meleh 2019; Bali et al. 2016; Boerner et al. 2013; Koralek et al. 2016; Vinck et al. 2019) . During the creation phase, individuals or informal independent online users successfully create misinformation due to the lack of competing accurate information (Wardle and Derakhshan 2017; Kouzy et al. 2020) . We found women, young people, and people with low levels of information were more prone to interpreting and passing on the misinformation that had been created (Adebimpe et al. 2015; Balami and Meleh 2019; Gidado et al. 2015; Klofstad et al. 2019) . During the production phase, social networks, online forums and social media ascertain misinformation and construct it into a media product (Wardle and Derakhshan 2017) , which was also reflected in 14 studies included in this review. A lack of consistent authoritative information Lack of assessment of whether messages are being understood by the target population Kanadiya and Sallar 2011 Not disclosing vaccine/trial information widely enough Kummervold et al. 2017 A large amount of incentive for vaccine trials make people think there are huge risks associated with vaccine Kummervold et al. 2017 Lack of deeper causal explanations of the mechanisms of the pandemic accessible to the layperson Stanley et al. 2020 N/R not reported, SNS social networking sites Fig. 2 Agents, messages and interpreters identified for the creation, production, distribution and reproduction of misinformation during large-scale infectious disease outbreaks contributes to uninformed decision-making, as trust in information becomes tied to personal experience (Wardle and Derakhshan 2017) . During the distribution phase, sensationalistic or unclear mass media coverage of misinformation debates can expose the public to false claims (Wardle and Derakhshan 2017) . Most of the studies in this review reported mass media as the main sources of information (Alqahtani et al. 2017) ; this, coupled with a lack of trust in government narratives and the disseminating power of social media, snowballs the distribution and reproduction of misinformation (Fig.  2) . Conventionally, a single database is searched in a rapid review (Tricco et al. 2015) ; however, we also employed a grey literature database search to help expand and strengthen our search. Nevertheless, this review also has some limitations we need to acknowledge. The inclusion criteria may have been broad, but we felt this was necessary to capture literature on the different aspects of misinformation in outbreak scenarios adequately. Furthermore, in this review, we were unable to assess the quality of the literature, due to the variability in the type of records identified in the review.",
