Here we present a countryspecific, modified Susceptible, Exposed, Infectious, Removed (SEIR) model of SARS-CoV-2 transmission using data from the Johns Hopkins University COVID-19 Dashboard. Intercountry differences in initial exposure, cultural/environmental factors, reporting requirements and stringency of mitigation strategies were incorporated. Asymptomatic patients and superspreaders were also factored into our model. Using these data, our model estimated 65.8% of cases as asymptomatic; symptomatic and asymptomatic people were estimated to infect 2.12 and 5.83 other people, respectively. An estimated 9.55% of cases were super-spreaders with a 2.11-fold higher transmission rate than average. Our model estimated a mean maximum infection rate of 0.927 cases/day (inter-country range, 0.63-1.41) without mitigation strategies. Mitigation strategies with a stringency index value of \u226560% were estimated to be required to reduce the reproduction ratio below 1. It was predicted that cases over the next 2 months would differ between countries, with certain countries likely to experience an accelerated accumulation of cases. Together, results from our model can guide distribution of diagnostic tests, impact clinical trial development, support medication development and distribution and inform mitigation strategies to reduce COVID-19 spread.",

Although the magnitude of infectiousness in asymptomatic patients (i.e. when the infector has no symptoms throughout the course of the disease) is difficult to quantify, these cases are expected to heavily impact transmission dynamics [25, 26] . Indeed, non-peer-reviewed mathematical modelling studies highlight the importance of accounting for asymptomatic persons when describing transmission dynamics [27, 28] . As such, this analysis could support public health considerations and suggest, by quantifying their contributions, that asymptomatic persons might be major drivers of the COVID-19 pandemic. Unless asymptomatic persons happen to get tested, they may continue to socialize and work during the entire infectious period, in contrast to situations in which the vast majority of people are symptomatic and can be identified without testing and for whom rapid quarantine is possible.",

Accounting for the proportion of asymptomatic cases estimated by the model, it can be derived that asymptomatic persons are responsible for 84% of new infections. Thus, the relationship between the stringency index and the daily infection rate could be estimated within the model; an example based on global level data is shown in Fig. 3 . A stringency index value of 35.3% was estimated as required to result in a 50% decrease in daily infection rate with a range between 17.4% and 74.5%, depending on the country. Therefore, the stringency index must exceed 60% to result in the RR in symptomatic cases dropping below 1 (Fig. 3) .",

In the absence of mitigation, this would lead to one symptomatic super-spreader infecting approximately 6.6 people and one asymptomatic super-spreader infecting almost 11 people, highlighting the large contribution this small proportion of people can make to virus transmission, which is consistent with previous reports [40] . Furthermore, our model confirms that most new cases result from asymptomatic transmission, occurring either during the pre-symptomatic period (from persons who later become symptomatic) or from asymptomatic persons [27, 28] .

As data on these factors are gathered over time, it may be possible to integrate them into our model to support future forecasting. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that this model has remained relatively stable since September 2020, with bi-weekly updates only minimally impacting the forecasting results. Finally, the model does not account for the availability of a vaccine. When an efficacious vaccine is widely available, our model must be adjusted to account for the reduced size of the susceptible population and the limited possibility of transmission. As with all predictive models, additional data on each of these factors will improve our understanding of SARS-CoV-2 transmission; integrating these data into our model can support more accurate forecasting in the future.",
