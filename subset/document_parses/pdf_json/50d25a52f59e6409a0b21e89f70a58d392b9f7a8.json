            "text": "The emergence of a novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in December 2019 has rapidly evolved into one of the major pandemics in mankind's history. To contain the spread of the virus, many governments as well as local authorities across the globe have urged their citizens to remain at home and have implemented strict social distancing, while enterprises and schools have remained closed. As a result, the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has produced major adverse health, social and financial consequences. In a recently published survey of more than 2500 adults from 49 countries, it was shown that the pandemic adversely affected sleep quality across the world. 1 Indeed, although overall sleep duration increased, 40% of the respondents reported decreased sleep quality. Consumption of sleeping pills increased by 20% compared to pre-pandemic levels. 1 Several reports from single countries involving adult participants demonstrated delayed bedtime and wake time during the lockdown period compared to before the pandemic, as well as increased sleep duration among young adults, while other studies showed unchanged or even decreased sleep duration. [2] [3] [4] Disturbed sleep quality, insomnia, and frequent awakenings were commonly reported problems in adults. 5, 6 Children represent a particularly active population group. 7 Confinement at home during the lockdown period has led to disruption of their daily lifestyle, principally as cessation of in-person school attendance, transition to online learning, discontinuation of interactions with peers, and limited outdoor activities. 8, 9 Social isolation, unconstrained sleep schedules, prolonged screen exposure, along with the inherent uncertainties and fear related to the pandemic likely affected their sleep patterns. Indeed, a few descriptive studies of children from countries with high incidence rates of SARS-CoV-2 infection revealed changes in sleep-wake routines. 10, 11 In a small cohort of overweight children and adolescents from Verona, Italy, mean sleep time increased during the lockdown period. 11 Additionally, in a study of 1619 preschoolers from Zunyi, China, both bedtime and wake time were delayed in comparison with the respective patterns in a 2018 control population sample. 10 Because wake time was more delayed than bedtime, the mean sleep duration increased. 10 However, in both studies, changes in sleep duration were summarized as population means without mentioning any subgroups of children whose sleep duration might have diverged in opposite directions.",

Furthermore, the current study expands on previously published research findings by examining bed/wake times and sleep duration by age cohorts. Most notably, 14-to 17-year-old participants were more likely than 3-5 years old to sleep longer on weekdays during the lockdown compared to before the pandemic, and 6-to 13-year-old children were more likely than 3-5 years old to sleep longer on weekends.",
