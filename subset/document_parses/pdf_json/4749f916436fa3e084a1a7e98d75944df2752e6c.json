The term crisis has its roots in the ancient Greek word Kr\u00edno, which means to judge or decide, and although crisis has come to mean different things in different disciplines it typically implies that decisive action is needed to avoid potentially negative consequences associated with the crisis situation. Taking action in times of crisis, however, is challenging because such experiences are shot through with uncertainty (Ansell and Boin, 2019; Beghetto, 2020; Cohen and Cromwell, 2020) . We can thereby define a time of crisis as an experience of profound uncertainty coupled with a sense of urgency to take action to minimize or avoid potential negative outcomes. In considering the implications of this definition, it may be useful to further unpack some of its features.",

            "text": "The first feature pertains to an experience of uncertainty. Indeed, one of the markers of a crisis, is an experience of deep uncertainty (Ansell and Boin, 2019) . Deep or profound uncertainties differ from other forms of uncertainty because they strike us as completely unknowable (Beghetto, 2020) and move us into a \"state of genuine doubt\" (Peirce, 1958, n.p.) . It is under these states of genuine doubt that necessitate creative action, because former ways of thinking and acting are no longer viable. Moreover, in the info-digital age, where there is an abundance of information sources, the uncertainty people experience likely will be further compounded by conflicting and opposing perspectives rendering the situation as seemingly unknowable and thereby not actionable. It is not always problematic to leave profound uncertainties unresolved. When contemplating the profound uncertainties surrounding life's greatest mysteries, a person may learn to live with the uncertainty. In times of crisis, however, leaving uncertainty unresolved is problematic because it is coupled with the second feature of a crisis: a sense of urgency to resolve it. Indeed, this sense of urgency is associated with a recognition that action is needed otherwise some negative consequences will follow. Heslop and Ormerod (2019) have discussed the unique sense of urgency experienced in a time of crisis, explaining that it falls somewhere in-between the more urgent experience of an emergency or disaster (which require immediate action) and the less urgent risk of a harmful situation, which occurs on a more \"elongated timeframe\" (p. 150) and thereby does not require immediate action.",

            "text": "In this way, a time of crisis results in a paradoxical experience of recognizing that somewhat urgent and decisive action is needed in a context of a seemingly unknowable and profoundly uncertain situation. Indeed, given that times of crisis present people and organizations with the double whammy of profound uncertainty and a sense of urgency to avoid future harm, it can result in people experiencing intense fear and anxiety. Indeed, as Grupe and Nitschke (2013) have reported, people experience states of heightened anxiety whenever they anticipate averse or harmful events and there is uncertainty surrounding those future events. A crisis carries both of these features and thereby can cause a range of responses, some of which can result in creative and innovative outcomes and others which can be considered maladaptive. How then might such a threatening and paradoxical situation result in people taking creative action? The model 1 illustrated in Figure 1 represents an agentic perspective, which refers to actions and outcomes that are influenced by individual and organizational belief systems, prior behaviors, and environments, including more localized and broader socio-historical and cultural contexts (Bandura, 1997; Avery and Park, 2016; Karwowski and Beghetto, 2019) . In this way, the model represents a focused perspective, one that conceptualizes creative action as intentional action and is inclusive of individual, organizational, and larger social actions and outcomes that start with the experience of a crisis and then diverges into different pathways and outcomes depending on a variety of factors.",

            "text": "The assertions offered by this model are general enough that researchers from various disciplines can use them as the basis for designing studies aimed at testing and refining them at different units of analysis (e.g., individual, organizational, and societal). This is not to say that there will not be important nuances and differences in how researchers apply these assertions in designing studies aimed at testing them at individual, organizational, and societal levels of analysis. Indeed, each level will require methodologies and measures tailored to the specific features of the study. Still, this framework offers a starting point for designing such studies, so that researchers can develop an understanding of how the assertions vary within and across different contexts and units of analyses. 1 Although the model introduced in this paper model is grounded in the creativity studies literature, it is important to note that there are numerous disciplines, literatures, methodologies, and practices beyond the field of creativity studies that can and should be drawn on to inform, further develop, and strengthen the applicability of this model and the elements represented in the model (e.g., political philosophy, counseling psychology, STEM psychology, sociocultural psychology, organizational psychology, and sociology just to name a few). I would like to thank one of the reviewers for stressing this point and I have attempted to incorporate a few relevant examples as suggested by that reviewer throughout. The model offered here is intended to be a starting point and will only benefit from including a more diverse range of interdisciplinary perspectives, concepts, and ideas and practices within and across fields of study. The two different response pathways (creative vs. deferential action), can also be thought of as creativity and crisisspecific version of the classic approach| avoidance motivational orientation (Lewin, 1935) , which refers to reasons why people literally or figuratively move toward (i.e., approach) taking positive actions vs. move away from (i.e., avoid) negative experiences or feared outcomes (Elliot, 2008) . As will be discussed, a creative action (approach) orientation tends to be associated with creative outcomes; however, it is also possible for a blend of creative and deferential action (approach-avoid orientation) to result in creative outcomes (see also Roskes et al., 2012; Baas et al., 2020) . Finally, the experience of crisis and the factors associated with the different pathways and outcomes are influenced by and influence the surrounding socio-cultural and historical context. With those features in mind, we can now turn our discussion to the different pathways, including the asserted factors and potential outcomes associated with them.",

Regardless of the scale, however, taking creative action is no guarantee that doing so will result in creative or even beneficial outcomes. Indeed, as illustrated in the model and discussed below, even creative actions that lead to creative outcomes may have unintended secondary outcomes or even negative sideeffects (Merton, 1936; Baert, 1991; Peterson and Skolits, 2019; Oliver et al., 2020) . Another possible pathway, illustrated in the model, asserts that if creative action does not lead to what is judged to be a creative outcome and people are willing to continue to take creative risks of trying new things, then it may eventually result in creative outcomes. Otherwise, it likely will result in people deferring action (see differential action).",

However, the outcome of such actions can result in a variety of unintended and potentially harmful consequences (Merton, 1936; Baert, 1991; Moran, 2016) . Indeed, the impact of creative action can be thought of as taking on a life of its own, which can be both beneficial (make a positive contribution) or problematic (result in harm). Consequently, distinguishing between actions and outcomes in the model can help researchers and practitioners evaluate and actively monitor the primary (and secondary) impact of seemingly well intended and beneficial creative action on themselves and others. Moreover, the primary outcomes can, over time and in different contexts, result in secondary outcomes, which also can range from potentially beneficial to potentially problematic. Specifying the difference between action and outcome highlights the need for conceptualizing and evaluating creative outcomes separately from creative actions, including the recognition that different people and groups may evaluate outcomes differently based on their unique contextual, socio-cultural, and historical vantage point (Baert, 1991; Peterson and Skolits, 2019; Oliver et al., 2020) .",

The model, however, posits that creative outcomes do not necessarily result in positive or lasting outcomes, even if the initial creativity of the ideas or activities was judged to be positive and viable. Creativity researchers have, for instance, recognized that creativity can and often does result in unintentional (and, in some cases, even intentional) negative outcomes (Baert, 1991; Cropley et al., 2010; Moran, 2016) . The model thereby specifies that the creative outcomes that result from creative activity in times of crisis can run the gamut from causing personal and social harm (e.g., developing, selling, and using untested and potentially dangerous preventatives or treatments) to more positive and beneficial outcomes (e.g., scientists and medical professionals using appropriate protocols to develop and validate new or repurpose older approaches in an effort to help treat and prevent illness; teachers transforming safety screens on desks into cars windshields to make them more welcoming and less frightening for younger students to use). The model thereby takes creative outcomes one step further by highlighting that primary creative outcomes likely have secondary outcomes which may be positive, negative, or some combination thereof (See section \"secondary outcomes\").",

Avery and Park (2016) , for instance, report on how crisis efficacy (i.e., people's belief that they can conform to recommended behaviors during a crisis situation) is an important factor in following sensible health and safety directives during times uncertainty and crisis. It is therefore possible for human agency to still be exercised through an adaptive blend of deferential and adaptive creative actions.",

This requires an ongoing effort to anticipate, monitor, identify, and address potentially harmful secondary outcomes (Peterson and Skolits, 2019; Oliver et al., 2020) , which can emerge on an elongated time frame, when taking creative and deferential actions aimed at navigating and resolving the crisis.",

I introduced an agentic process model that asserts different empirically testable pathways that can result from different responses in times of crisis. A key initial step in this work will be for researchers to identify existing and needed measures and methods, in and beyond the field of creativity studies, which can be adapted and developed to test and refine the assertions presented in this model across individual, organizational, and societal levels. Fortunately, there has been rapid and continuing growth in methodologies and measures, across various disciplines, that researchers can draw on when developing studies aimed at testing the model.",

            "text": "The model introduced in this paper serves a starting point. It is not meant to be exhaustive in specifying the full range of responses or outcomes available to individuals and groups when encountering a crisis. Indeed, the two featured responses, creative action and differential action offer only two (albeit broadly encompassing) possibilities. Future work can help clarify the elements of the model, including clarifying the areas of overlap, identifying boundaries between creative and deferential responses, and specifying other types of responses that may not be adequately accounted for by either a creative or deferential response. Moreover, the focus in this paper was on different responses in the midst of crisis, subsequent work should also examine the full temporal trajectory of creative and deferential responses and outcomes including prior to a crisis, during a crisis, and following a crisis (Baert, 1991; Avery and Park, 2016; Cameron et al., 2018; Cohen and Cromwell, 2020; Leontidou, 2020) . This includes exploring the implications across the full temporal continuum at the individual, group, and broader societal level. Subsequent iterations of the model will also benefit from researchers working in interdisciplinary teams. Indeed, teams of interdisciplinary researchers drawing on existing literatures and approaches can go a long way in testing out, refining, and ultimately strengthening the model introduced in this paper.",
