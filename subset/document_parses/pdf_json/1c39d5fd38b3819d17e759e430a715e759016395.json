The aim of this study is to evaluate the understanding of young people, about COVID-19 during the early outbreak in Indonesia. An online-based cross-sectional data collection was conducted from adolescents aged 10 to 25 years, based on 10 questions regarding general COVID-19 information. There were 355 subjects from 25 out of 34 Indonesian provinces who participated in the study, with mean age of 19.93 \u00b1 2.91 years. Better understanding was found in the female and higher-income population. Largely, the subjects got the information from social media, instead of the official government site for COVID-19. Lack of understanding about crucial preventive measures was found, such as handwashing and physical distancing. In conclusion, the participants have an overall moderate-good initial understanding toward COVID-19 during the early outbreak in Indonesia. These results can be used as baseline data for development of awareness measurement tools.",

The participants were required to complete an e-consent form and then a self-reported questionnaire. The questionnaire was generated based on information provi ded by the government and reviewed by experts in field, followed by a field trial with 40 participants aged 18 to 22 years. The open-ended questions were given to evaluate respondents' knowledge of virology, clinical presentation, risk factors, prevention, control, symptoms handling, and one yes-no question regarding their awareness of the official government website for COVID-19 information. Each correct answer was valued 10 points. Those who scored 60 or above were considered as having good knowledge. Top five answers from each question are described. ",
