Besides advertisements in newspapers, exhibitions at medical convents, or other medical events, communication via digital channels has become increasingly important to recruit new employees [15] . Primarily, an attractive online presence via an attractive homepage and accompanying social media channels can increase the visibility of a (medical) company/ hospital substantially [16] .
