But the rapid biodegradation of the materials may interrupt neural tissue reconstruction in vivo. To improve the stability of the materials, the materials produced by NECM and chitosan hydrogels were crosslinked by genipine, glutaraldehyde or ultraviolet ray. Physicochemical property, degradation and biocompatibility of materials crosslinked by genipin, glutaraldehyde or ultraviolet ray were evaluated. The scaffold crosslinked by genipin possessed a porous structure, and the porosity ratio was 89.07 ? 4.90%, the average diameter of pore was 85.32 ? 5.34 lm. The crosslinked degree of the scaffold crosslinked by genipin and glutaraldehyde was 75.13 \u00b1 4.87%, 71.25 \u00b1 5.06% respectively; Uncrosslinked scaffold disintegrated when immerged in distilled water while the scaffold crosslinked by genipin and glutaraldehyde group retained their integrity. The scaffold crosslinked by genipin has better water absorption, water retention and anti-enzymatic hydrolysis ability than the other three groups. Cell cytotoxicity showed that the cytotoxicity of scaffold crosslinked by genipin was lower than that crosslinked by glutaraldehyde. The histocompatibility of scaffold crosslinked by genipin was also better than glutaraldehyde group. More cells grew well in the scaffold crosslinked by genipin when co-cultured with L929 cells. The decellularized nerve extracellular matrix/chitosan scaffold crosslinked by ().,-volV) ( 01234567 89().,-volV) the genipin has good mechanical properties, micro structure and biocompatibility, which is an ideal scaffold for the spinal cord tissue engineering.",

One of these scaffolds is decellularized nerve extracellular matrix (NECM), which is derived from the natural nerve, mainly composed of collagen, laminin, fibronectin, chondroitin sulfate and so on. It possesses physicochemical properties similar to autologous nerve with minimal immunological rejection Starnecker et al. 2018; Leiva et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2014 ). In our recent study, we optimized the decellularization technique of NECM, and confirmed both the NECM and cells-loaded NECM can promote axonal regeneration and construction of spinal cord neuron conduction function in animal models of SCI (Tian et al. 2017; Wang et al. 2014) .

Crosslinking degree and stability of the scaffold crosslinked by various crosslinking agents are different. Observed by SEM, the scaffold crosslinked by genipin showed a homogeneous porous structure, while the GA group and the UV crosslinked group showed multilayer sheet structure. The reason was that the scaffold material first formed a stable hydrogel under the action of genipin, and the gel occurred before the solid-liquid phase separation, so the porous sponge liked structure formated. The scaffolds of other three groups directly experience the process of solidliquid separation, the scaffolds is affected by the crystallization of glacial acetic acid, showing a flake or layer. Because of the high crosslinking degree of the GA group, compared with the UV and NCL group, the scaffolds showed a tighter and orderly arrangement between layers. The porosity rate of all the scaffolds of four groups produced in this study was more than 80%. Cell proliferation and migration is known to be connected with surfaces and porosity of the material (Vila-Sanjurjo et al. 2019) . The transportation of the metabolites and nutrients of the cells is improved with the increased of the porosity, which is beneficial to the migration and proliferation of the cells. But as the porosity increased, the strength of the scaffold will be weakened accordingly (Biswas et al. 2017; Kang et al. 2017) . The porosity rate of the GP group was higher than that of the other three groups. The result also Furthermore, the scaffold pore sizes also influence the function of cells for they play an essential role in nutrient and oxygen diffusion and waste removal. And the ideal pore sizes for cell adhesion, cell-cell interaction, cell transmigration and differentiation depending on the various tissue regeneration. It was shown that PCL scaffolds with a pore size of 125 lm best supported PC12 cells neural differentiation in vitro (Vijayavenkataraman et al. 2018) . The axon growth along the longitudinal direction of 3D hydrogel alginate displayed the highest axon density within the scaffold capillary diameter of 71-86 lm (Pawar et al. 2011) . It was found that glial and axonal grew better on the pore sizes of collagen I scaffold ranging from 20 to 50 lm (Bozkurt et al. 2009 ). And collagen membrane with pore sizes of 100 lm was proper for the transplantation and differentiation of neural stem cells (Yuan et al. 2014) . As a comprehensive analysis of previous studies, the ideal pore sizes of scaffold for nerve regeneration are depending on the origin of biomaterial. Scaffolds with pore sizes around 100 lm seem to be more suitable for the regeneration of neurons (Bruzauskaite et al. 2016) . In this study, the scaffold crosslinked by GP showed a uniform honeycomb porous structure with the pore sizes about 85.32 ? 5.34 lm which were closed to the reported ideal pore sizes. We will prepare the scaffold with different pore sizes and screen out the scaffold with best pore sizes for nerve regeneration in further study.",

At the same time, the swelled scaffold provide greater space for cell adhesion and migration and a better local growth microenvironment . The swelling ratio of the scaffolds crosslinked by genipin and glutaraldehyde was 741 ? 85.04% and 696.75 ? 50.4% respectively, which was higher than that of UV group and the NCL group (578.50 ? 50.78%, 565.40 ? 49.36).

With the increase of crosslinking degree, mechanical strength will increase, while the tensile strength and elongation will decrease. The ideal scaffold should maintain a both elasticity and mechanical strength (Chen et al. 2009; Chiono et al. 2008; Li et al. 2015) . Measured by ninhydrin method, the crosslinking ability of GP went near to GA, was 75.13 ? 4.87% and 71.25 ? 5.06%, respectively. Dissolution tests showed that the scaffolds crosslinked by the GP group and the GA group degradated slowly relatively. The degradation rates of them were lower than that of the NCL group and the UV group. After implanted in the body, the scaffold can be degraded by the various components, especially the lysozyme and cathepsin. The dissolution tests reflected that scaffold crosslinked by the GP group and the GA group had better ability to resist the enzyme compared to the UV group and the NCL group. Therefore, their structure and morphology can be maintained and play the role in mediating cell and tissue growth and guiding the axon regeneration within a certain period.",
