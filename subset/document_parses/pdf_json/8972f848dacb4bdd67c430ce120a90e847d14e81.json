To inform future disease prevention and control, we analyzed global data to exam the relationship between state vulnerabilities and COVID-19 incidences and deaths. Methods: Vulnerability was measured using the Fragile States Index (FSI). FSI is created by the Fund for Peace to assess levels of fragility for individual countries. Total FSI score and scores for 12 specific indicators were used as the predictor variables. Outcome variables were national cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths up to September 16, 2020, derived the World Health Organization. Cumulative incidence rates were computed using 2019 National population derived from the World Bank, and case fatality rates were computed as the ratio of deaths/COVID-19 cases. Countries with incomplete data were excluded, yielding a final sample of 146 countries. Multivariate regression was used to examine the association between the predictor and the outcome measures.",

FSI total scores were negatively associated with both COVID-19 cumulative incidence rates (\u03b2 = -0.0135, P < 0.001) and case fatality rates (\u03b2 = -0.0147, P < 0.05). Of the 12 FSI indicators, three negatively associated with COVID-19 incidences were E1( Economic Decline and Poverty), E3 (Human Flight and Brain Drain), and S2 (Refugees and Internally Displaced Persons); two positively associated were P1 (State Legitimacy) and X1 (External Intervention). With regard to association with case fatality rates, C1 (Security Apparatus) was positive, and P3 (Human Rights and Rule of Law) and X1 was negative. Conclusions: With FSI measures by the Fund of Peace, overall, more fragile countries are less likely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and even if affected, death rates were lower. However, poor in state legitimacy and lack of external intervention are risk for COVID-19 infection and lack of security apparatus is risky for COVID-19 death. Implications of the study findings are discussed and additional studies are needed to examine the mechanisms underpinning these relationships.",

Studies on many risk factors for the COVID- 19 have been reported in the literature; however, few studies have examined the matter using national-level data. Furthermore, from these published studies, we noted that anti-epidemic measures at the national level often performed inadequately in predicting disease burdens emanating from the COVID-19 pandemic. 3, 4 State fragility is a concept that reflects a country's responsiveness to dangerous events. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, fragile states are considered those that lack the ability to develop mutually constructive relations with society and often have a weak capacity to perform basic governance functions. 5 Consequently, fragile states tend to be vulnerable at multiple levels, including political, socioeconomic, and others. 6, 7 With regard to health, vulnerability may include population susceptibility and barriers to healthcare access, 8, 9 manifesting as outbreaks of epidemics, high incidence, and high mortality. 10 The Fragile States Index (FSI), established by the Fund for Peace, is a measure used to quantify the degree of state fragility. It has served as a tool for monitoring all countries worldwide in order to earmark those located in the alert zone for assistance, 11 promote global peace and development, and identify countries in need of developmental assistance. 12 In this study, we used FSI as measure of national vulnerability to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The scores of the 12 specific indicators range from 0 to 10, with 0 representing the lowest vulnerability and 10 the highest vulnerability. Total FSI scores for individual countries (ranging from 0 to 120) were computed by summating the 12 individual scores. The total FSI scores were used to rank individual countries by fragility. In this study, we used it to assess the vulnerability to COVID-19 for individual countries. The outcome variables for individual countries were the cumulative incidence rates and case fatality rates of COVID-19 from the first reported case up to September 16, 2020, when the analysis was completed for this study. Data for COVID-19 cases and deaths are accessible from various sources, and we used data reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). In particular, data used in this analysis were acquired from the WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard. 1 To compute the cumulative incidence rates by country, national population data are needed for individual countries in the world. Since 2020 population data were not available, we typically used 2019 population data instead. To ensure comparability, we acquired population data from the World Bank, 17 the most reliable population data source for global health research. 18 Of the 216 countries/territories in the world, countries with incomplete data on the key variables (i.e., FSI, COVID-19 cases and deaths, and total population) were excluded, yielding a final sample of 146 countries that were included in the analysis.",

In other words, these countries are more vulnerable to infectious diseases than those that are more fragile based on FSI measures. For example, we identified a negative relationship between economic decline and COVID-19 infection, while poor countries often have higher tuberculosis prevalence. 23, 24 However, this seemingly contradictory finding appears to be reasonable based on a more precise measure of development. Two ecological studies, including one with provincial data from China 25 as well as another with national data from 28 European countries and state data from the USA, 26 demonstrated a significantly positive relationship between national gross domestic product (GDP) and cumulative COVID-19 cases. Results from these two studies are less likely to be affected by cross-entity differences in COVID-19 tests because each study focused on a considerably homogenous population.
