Low attack rates were noted for children, with linearly increasing numbers for those above the age of 60 years. Of 171 cases among close contact persons, 113 (66%) lived together with a known case in one household. Based on 106 cases (62%), the mean serial interval was 5.9 d (SD: 4.45; median: 5 d, IQR: 3-8.25 d). The interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was significantly longer in infected close contact persons than in index cases (median 7 versus 5 d; p < 0.00001). Figure 3 depicts case numbers, hospitalizations (as officially reported to the Public Health department until October 5, 2020) and age related case fatality ratios (CFR) in the considered period. A total of 154 cases (14.2%) were hospitalized. There were no reported hospitalizations in the age group 11 to 20 years, whereas the greatest proportion of hospitalizations (69.7%) were noted in the group aged 81 to 90 years. A linear increase in hospitalizations over time was seen in patients aged 31 to 40 years and those aged 81 to 90 years [14, 15] The proportion of initially hospitalized patients was 36% in patients with dyspnoea, and 13% in patients without dyspnoea. Thus, the relative risk of hospitalization with dyspnoea at the time of symptom onset was 2.77 compared to patients without dyspnoea. The frequency of initial hospitalization was 24% when risk factors were present, and 8% when they were absent. This corresponds to a threefold increased relative risk of hospitalization in the presence of risk factors. Fatalities increased with age, starting with the youngest case aged 51 years.",

Twenty of 23 patients (87%) were hospitalized. None of the fatal cases was reported to be a nursing home resident. The duration of disease (symptom onset to death) varied considerably (median 12 days, IQR: 2-33 days, maximum 59 days). Data on incidence and fatalities were compared with other regional and international data (Table S1, supplementary materials) [1, [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In Regensburg, the incidence was lower than in the whole of Oberpfalz and Bavaria. In heavily affected Tirschenreuth, a county located approximately 100 km north of Regensburg, the incidence was 5 times as high and the CFR was approximately 5.5 times as high as in Regensburg. Figure S2 (supplementary materials) shows cases (A) and fatalities (B) of Regensburg, Tirschenreuth, Oberpfalz and Bavaria by age group. In Regensburg, comparably more persons of younger age were affected (20-29 years and 30-39 years), whereas in Tirschenreuth, persons aged 70-79 years and 80-89 years were more frequently affected. Surprisingly, the highest CFR of 43.5% was noted there in the age group 60-69 years. In Tirschenreuth, younger people aged 20-49 years also died from the disease, whereas in Regensburg fatal cases did not occur below the age of 50. ",

The overall secondary attack rate of 9.3% in Regensburg is based on reported cases. Given our strict definition of a close contact person, this figure possibly represents an overestimation. An almost linear increase in the attack rate with age is consistent with other reports [22] . These data are based on the assumption of linear spreading from known cases, which is certainly debatable for SARS-CoV-2. Household members appear to have a higher risk of infection [23] .
