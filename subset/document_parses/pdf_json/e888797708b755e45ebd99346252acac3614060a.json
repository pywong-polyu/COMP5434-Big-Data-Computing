This study explores the influence of genetic and nongenetic factors on INR normalization in the Arab (major part of Near Eastern) population in preprocedural warfarin management. Methods: An observational prospective cohort study was designed to recruit Arab patients taking warfarin and scheduled for an elective procedure. Two INR readings were recorded. DNA extraction and genotyping of variants in CYP2C9*2, CYP2C9*3, CYP4F2*3, VKORC1*2, and FII (rs5896) and FVII (rs3093229) genes using real-time polymerase chain reaction were performed. Results: Data from 116 patients were included in the analysis. CYP2C9 and VKORC1 genetic variants carriers required lower maintenance dose compared to non-carriers. The analysis showed that ciprofloxacin, antiplatelet medications, and INR index (INR at visit 1) are the only factors associated with the INR decline rate. Also, the proportion of CYP2C9*3 carriers with normal INR (\u22641.2) on the day of surgery was significantly lower than those with wild-type genotype (28% vs 60%, p=0.013). In addition, heparin bridging, INR target, and Sudanese nationality are significant predictors of INR normalization (\u22641.2) on the day of the procedure. Conclusion: Despite the confirmed effect of genetic factors on warfarin maintenance dose, the study was not able to find a significant effect of any genetic factor on the rate of INR normalization possibly due to the small sample size. Index INR and interacting medications showed to be significant predictors of INR decline rate.",

            "text": "Warfarin has been the mainstay oral anticoagulant (OAC) prescribed in thromboembolic conditions for several decades. 1, 2 While direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have been widely used lately, warfarin remains a very important option, especially in patients who cannot afford DOACs or have a contraindication to their use. 3 With warfarin challenging narrow therapeutic index, the international normalized ratio (INR) is a handy surrogate marker to monitor warfarin's therapeutic effect. 4 In procedures associated with more than minimal bleeding risk, warfarin-receiving patients are expected to stop it 5-7 days before surgery to achieve a baseline INR level and reduce the risk of bleeding during and after the procedure. 5 However, the rate of INR decline varies across patients and may require a shorter or longer warfarin interruption period. Recent studies 6, 7 found that 23% of the patients who stopped warfarin still had an INR > 1.2 following 4.7 days of warfarin holding, and 7% also had a preoperative INR > 1.5 after 5 days. Furthermore, Spyropoulos et al 8 and Pengo et al 9 found that the mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) INR was 1.8 \u00b1 0.5 after 5-6 days of warfarin discontinuation.",

            "text": "Mechanistically, warfarin's elimination half-life plays a vital role in INR normalization rate and may at least partly explain this variability. 10 Warfarin is a mixture of two active enantiomers: the (R) and (S) enantiomers, where the latter has five-fold higher anticoagulation potency than the former. 11 Indeed, the S-enantiomer is metabolized by the Cytochrome P450-family 2, subfamily C, member 9 (CYP2C9) enzyme. [12] [13] [14] Genetic variants in CYP2C9 have been widely studied, and it was found that CYP2C9*2 (rs1799853) and CYP2C9*3 (rs1057910) alleles are the most common variant alleles across majority of populations including the Middle Eastern and North Africa (MENA) population. 15 These variants (CYP2C9*2 and CYP2C9*3) account for reductions in the CYP2C9 enzymatic activity to 12-70% and almost no enzymatic activity, respectively. 16 The Cytochrome P450-family 4, subfamily F, member 2 (CYP4F2) is another liver enzyme that inactivates the hydroxy-vitamin K1 and may also have an impact on warfarin and the rate of INR normalization. 4 CYP4F2*3 (rs2108622) is a non-synonymous variant in the CYP4F2 gene that has been associated with a reduction in the CYP4F2 enzyme activity by 8-11% and may be associated with warfarin dose increase by 4-12%. 5, 17 CYP4F2*3 is a commonly occurring mutation in various populations and has a minor allele frequency (MAF) of 30-42% in the MENA region. 18 The most crucial pharmacodynamic target for warfarin is vitamin K epoxide reductase complex subunit 1 (VKORC1) enzyme, which is inhibited by warfarin leading to reduction in the reduced form of vitamin K needed for the activation of its dependent coagulation factors (II, VII, IX, and X). 19 The most common genetic variation in the VKORC1 gene is VKORC1*2 \u22121639G>A (rs9923231), which is relatively common (30-72%) in patients of MENA descent. 14,18 A recent local study showed that VKORC1 and CYP2C9 variants along with clinical factors can explain about 40% of warfarin dose variability in Qatari population. 20 The update of Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementation Consortium (CPIC) guideline in 2016 incorporated recommendations for warfarin dose based on the genetic information of CYP2C9, VKORC1 and CYP4F2 polymorphism. 21 Other than the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic targets for warfarin, coagulation factors regeneration is considered a limiting step in INR decline rate; these factors' genetic polymorphisms may affect their regeneration and synthesis rates and eventually affect the time for INR normalization. 10, 22 The most common genetic polymorphisms in the gene encoding for factor VII (FVII) is (rs3093229), which has an average prevalence of 22% among diverse populations. 23, 24 Additionally, it has been found that patients' sensitivity to warfarin is generally affected by variations in factor II (FII) gene (rs5896). 25, 26 FII rs5896 variant has a prevalence of 14% among the American population and 13% among the Italians. [25] [26] [27] Genetic factors that influence INR normalization during preprocedural warfarin interruption have been explored directly and indirectly in previous studies with various ethnic groups. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] Some found that CYP2C9 is the only genetic player, 28, 32, 34 while others failed to find any association between genetic variants and INR decline. [29] [30] [31] 33 To the best of our knowledge, no studies investigated the effect of CYP2C9, CYP4F2, and VKORC1 genetic polymorphism on INR decline in the Arab (major part of Near Eastern) population. Moreover, coagulations FII and FVII polymorphisms on INR normalization have not been explored before. This study explored the influence of CYP2C9, VKORC1, CYP4F2, FII, and FVII genetic polymorphisms and non-genetic factors on INR normalization in the Arab (major part of Near Eastern) population in preprocedural warfarin management.",

Unfortunately, there is a high inter-and intra-individual variability in warfarin response. 8 This variability is not seen only during warfarin dosing but also during warfarin interruption in periprocedural management. Therefore, it was reasonable to investigate the factors that may affect INR decline after warfarin discontinuation during the preprocedural time.",

Three studies 30, 31, 33 declined to find any significant genetic predictor of INR decline rate because of their small sample size, which made them not powered enough to detect any difference between carriers and non-carriers of genetics polymorphism. Some of these studies were also limited by the retrospective study design and potential selection bias. 30, 31 Nevertheless, some reported only an impact of CYP2C9 genetic polymorphic alleles on INR normalization. 32, 34 Since early 2000, it was observed that the CYP2C9 genetic variant is a significant predictor of the warfarin clearance as an outcome in vivo that may be sound representative of INR decline as an outcome. 32, 34 A possible explanation for this might be that 72% of performed procedures were minor procedures like dental intervention or endoscopy in which healthcare providers do not prefer a major drop in INR (\u22641.2) during warfarin discontinuation; however, the presence of 17.2% of patients with INR \u22651.5 could lead to increasing the cost of preoperative admission, postponing, or canceling planned procedures. This rate was even more than twice what was previously reported. 6, 7 In one of these two cited studies, it was found that 23% of the patients who stopped warfarin attained an INR >1.2 and 7% reached a preoperative INR > 1.5, while the other revealed that 17% of the subjects got INR >1.5 on the day of the procedure.",

            "text": "Another clinically relevant finding was that our results reconfirm the association of CYP2C9 and VKORC1 polymorphisms with weekly warfarin dose. It was clear that carriers of wild-type allele of CYP2C9 or VKORC1 required a higher mean warfarin dose than carriers of one or two copies of reduced or no function alleles of these genes. On the other hand, and despite its high prevalence, CYP4F2*3 did not affect warfarin dose as previously shown in studies performed on Egyptian and Qatari populations. 20, 45 The current study's multiple regression analysis showed that antiplatelet and ciprofloxacin use, and INR index are significant predictors of the INR decline rate. The observed negative relationship between the ciprofloxacin and INR decline rate is likely related to the suppression of vitamin K producing intestinal flora and the CYP inhibition by ciprofloxacin which leads to further delay in warfarin clearance and blunts the INR drop. 51 The significant positive association between the INR index and INR decline rate means that with higher starting INR at the time of interruption, a faster drop in the rate of INR is expected. This was in agreement with the results observed by Abohelaika et al 28 and Burmester et al. 30 ",

Additionally, it is the first research that investigated the effect of coagulation factors polymorphism on INR normalization. Our study has weaknesses that temper our findings. Notably, the small sample size was likely the leading cause of impeding the necessary power to detect the various significant impact of genetic variants. The small sample size was primarily due to the slow recruitment and low flow of eligible patients. Moreover, the unprecedented situation of the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has resulted in suspending elective surgeries for 6 months at our local clinical setting. To lighten this up, we included eligible patients from previous research. 20 Another limitation is that not all participants stopped warfarin for the same period, and they had different INR targets. Nevertheless, our analysis revealed no significant difference between the status of INR \u22641.2 and the INR decline rate (expressed as log slop) which considers the days of interruption and INR index. To develop a complete picture of genetics polymorphism's impact on INR decline rate, an additional more extensive study with patient stratification according to the current results will be needed to eliminate the effect of potential confounders. Equally important, cost-effective analysis of implementing pharmacogenetics-based algorithm will guide decision-makers to which approach must be subsidized.",

The INR decline rate (slope) was calculated as the ratio between the difference in INR values (delta INR) and the difference in days at which these INRs were measured (delta days). Single linear regression (SLR) was performed to assess the impact of genetic, clinical, and demographic factors as a continuous variable on the rate of INR decline. Multiple linear regression (MLR) modeling was used to determine the factors associated with the INR decline and to develop INR normalization model. Logistic regression was used to test the association between genetic and non-genetic factors with an INR of \u22641.2 versus >1.2 on the day before or on the day of the planned surgery.
