            "text": "e onset of type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a consequence of the progressive loss of adequate \u03b2-cell insulin secretion, which frequently occurs under a background of insulin resistance. Currently, nearly 13 million Mexicans are living with diabetes. Moreover, due to poor socioeconomic conditions and the cultural idiosyncrasies of the Mexican population, the use of medicinal plants to treat T2D is a common practice in Mexico. In the Mexican state of Hidalgo, we found the traditional use of Calea urticifolia (CU) to treat this disease. To treat T2D, people drink an infusion made from the aerial part of the plant throughout the day. With the aim of investigating whether the infusion at a traditional dose produces a hypoglycemic effect in either the fasting or postprandial state, we measured the effect of the infusion in a hyperglycemic animal model (rats administered streptozotocin (STZ) and nicotinamide (NZ)) by conducting a glucose tolerance test and constructing a blood-glucose curve. We then analyzed whether the observed effect was related to the inhibition of glucose absorption in the gut or the inhibition of hepatic glucose output (HGO) in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, we confirmed our findings by identifying the potential targets of the infusion via a network pharmacology analysis. rough high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and thin layer chromatography (TLC), we detected a number of compounds in the extract and identified two of them. e plant extract produced a highly significant hypoglycemic effect under fasting conditions and a weak hypoglycemic effect following glucose or sucrose challenge. Although the plant extract blocked only 20% of the alpha-glucosidase enzyme activity in vitro, in the pyruvate tolerance test (which measures the liberation of hepatic glucose), it significantly reduced glucose levels. Furthermore, in vitro, the extract diminished the activity of the glucose-6-phosphatase complex by 90%. In addition, by conducting TLC, we detected the presence of chlorogenic acid and rutin, which have been reported to block HGO. e results presented here provide evidence of the hypoglycemic effect of the traditionally used C. urticifolia extract and demonstrate that this effect is associated with both a reduction in glucose synthesis via gluconeogenesis due to the phytochemical composition of the extract and a slight blockage of glucose absorption in the gut.",

In the period of insulin resistance, this hormone is ineffective, which induces an increase in insulin production. Over time, inadequate production of insulin develops as a result of the failure of pancreatic \u03b2-cells to keep up with demand [2] . is condition causes serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, and nerves. e IDF reported in 2019 that there was an estimated 463.0 million people living with diabetes worldwide. In their report, Mexico ranked sixth in the world, with 12.8 million patients with diabetes.",

In July 2020, the Johns Hopkins University (JHU) website reported that Mexico ranked 6 th worldwide in the number of COVID-19-infected people and 3 rd in global deaths [5] , and the Mexican government reported that, at that same time, the second most common comorbidity of people who died due to COVID-19 was diabetes [6] . ese observations show that Mexico is far from controlling the general health of diabetic patients and that efforts to improve the glycemic control of diabetic patients are needed.",

To date, no animal model with all the characteristics of the disease has been developed; in the present work, we selected the STZ-NA-induced hyperglycemic model, which produces hyperglycemia due to a failure in \u03b2-cells [13] . Although the model does not properly present insulin resistance, it is useful because glucose levels are moderately high and increase after an injection of pyruvate. In addition, this model responds to the control drugs used here: glibenclamide, repaglinide, metformin, and acarbose. e values represent the mean \u00b1 SEM; in the same row, a indicates statistically significant differences compared with time 0; in the same column, b indicates statistically significant differences compared with the normoglycemic control group and c indicates statistically significant differences compared with the hyperglycemic + pyruvate group; p \u2264 0.05, n \ufffd 6.",
