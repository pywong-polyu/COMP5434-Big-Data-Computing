Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pneumonia was diagnosed from the results of chest computed tomography (CT) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction test. Chest CT showed multiple patchy ground-glass nodules (GGNs), mainly in the peripheral lung parenchyma beneath the pleura (Fig. 1A) . A GGN in the right upper lobe seemed to show characteristics differing from other GGNs on chest CT, so follow-up CT was scheduled after his recovery. He was discharged without sequelae after 19 days of treatment, and follow-up CT was performed three months later (Fig. 1B) . Only the GGN (Fig. 1B , arrow) in the right upper lobe remained, although the other pneumonia shadows had disappeared. Based on these imaging findings, primary pulmonary adenocarcinoma was suspected. Thoracic surgery was performed to obtain a definitive diagnosis, and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) was histopathologically diagnosed. Although follow-up CT is not cost-effective for all COVID-19 pneumonia patients, the possibility of lung neoplasm should be kept in mind if the GGN shows characteristics non-specific for viral infection, such as solitary nature, relative roundness, well-defined borders, and distance from the pleura. If the clinician has such a suspicion, a follow-up CT at low dose is recommended after one to three months according to the guidelines for pulmonary nodules with suspected infection [1] .",
