In terms of the ratios between visits to the diuresis clinic and visits to HF clinics, the numbers from Jan 11 th to Mar 27 th , Mar 21 st to Apr 17 th , and Apr 18 th to July 3 rd were 3%, 1%, and 3%, respectively. The decrease in patients at the diuresis clinic was more pronounced than the reduction in the scheduled regular HF visits during Mar 21 st to Apr 17 th . The number of visits to diuresis clinic returned to historical values immediately after reopening on Apr 24 th and was maintained thereafter. No surge in visits to diuresis clinic was observed, despite the \"diuresis clinic debt\" incurred during the Public Health State of Emergency and Shelter-in-Place periods.",

Alternatively, there may be improved adherence to medical therapy 5 leading to reduced episodes of acute HF and need for visits to the diuresis clinic.",
