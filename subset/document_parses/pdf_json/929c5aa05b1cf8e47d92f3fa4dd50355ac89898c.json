We reviewed the accuracy of forecasts made during prior twenty-first century epidemics, namely SARS, H1N1, and Ebola. We found that while disease prediction models were relatively nascent as a research focus during SARS and H1N1, for Ebola, numerous such forecasts were published. We found that forecasts of deaths for Ebola were often far from the eventual reality, with a strong tendency to over predict. Given the societal prominence of these models, it is crucial that their uncertainty be communicated. Otherwise, we will be unaware if we are being falsely lulled into complacency or unjustifiably shocked into action.",

To systematically evaluate the success of prior forecasting models, we reviewed predictions from three twenty-first century epidemics: the 2002-2004 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and the 2014 Ebola virus disease outbreak. We found that during the SARS and H1N1 outbreaks, only a few studies attempted to predict future cases and were ultimately unsuccessful. During the Ebola epidemic, the number of forecasting studies increased dramatically, and most overestimated-quite substantially-the true number of cases and deaths.",

For our analysis of the Ebola epidemic, we utilized the references from a prior Ebola review [8] . Of the reviewed studies, only three predicted deaths. For the remaining studies that predicted cases, we extrapolated deaths by multiplying cases with the studies' estimates of case fatality rates (CFR).

It is reassuring to have scientists rise to the challenge to help leaders make informed decisions. However, a review of forecasts from Ebola suggests that the majority of predictions were far from the eventual reality. In fact, COVID-19 predictions too have ranged from massive underestimates-a worst case scenario of 50,562 cases in Italy by May 31st (there were over 230,000 cases) [15, 16] -to proven overestimates-190,000 cases in Wuhan, China by April (there were 50,339 cases by the middle of May) [17, 18] . A model developed by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has gained prominence and has been widely utilized for state and federal policymaking. However, even this model has been often inaccurate at local and national levels, tending to provide overly narrow confidence intervals [19, 20] . Thus, we must consider the historically poor performance of disease prediction models when engaging with predictions for COVID-19.",
