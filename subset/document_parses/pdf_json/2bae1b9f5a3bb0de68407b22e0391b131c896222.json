This study aimed to understand the impacts of a global pediatrics track on graduates' career choices, skills, and current engagement in global health. An electronic survey was sent to 110 track graduates in February to April 2020. Data were analyzed with descriptive statistics and paired t-tests. Content analysis of written comments was conducted. The response rate was 62% overall, varying by question. Overall, 75% of responding graduates reported global pediatrics track participation affected their career choices. Eighty-four percent recalled plans to work in global health after graduation and 64% of respondents reported working in global health abroad or at home at the time of the survey. Incorporation of public health and global research represented the greatest percentage change in career plans from the time of enrollment to graduation (24% and 27%, respectively). Ninety-five percent of respondents reported that track participation improved their ability to elicit information about cultural beliefs and practices, and 86% reported improvement in cost-conscious care. An increase in global health knowledge and skills was the most common category of impact cited by respondents. Neonatal resuscitation, bubble continuous positive airway pressure, and homemade spacers for metered-dose inhalers were the most used global health-adapted skills. Our study found that graduates of the global pediatrics track perceive their participation affected their knowledge, skills, and attitudes positively, with the potential to improve clinical care and promote health equity locally and globally.",

            "text": "Global child health education has been defined as \"the study of diseases and their social determinants (which affect most children worldwide and are not contained by borders), the development of cultural humility, and the acquisition of a skill set for work in resource-limited settings.\" 1 Many American pediatric residency programs combine the curricula, skills training, experiences, and mentorship required to achieve the goals of global child health education into tracks or certificate programs. 2 Approximately one quarter of all pediatric residency programs in the United States reported having a dedicated global pediatrics track in a 2014 survey. 3 The University of Minnesota has offered a global pediatrics track since 2005. It is an opt-in residency track offered to all pediatric and medicine-pediatric residents. There is no cap on enrollment. On average, 53% of pediatric residents and 65% of medicine-pediatric residents participate in the track every year. To earn a global pediatrics track certificate at the University of Minnesota, participants are expected 1) to participate in an educational curriculum including a core set of required sessions; 2) to complete pre-travel preparation, which includes skills training as well as mental and emotional preparedness through simulations; 3) to complete successfully a global child health elective and associated assignments, including an academic project and engagement in post-elective debriefing; and 4) to present their academic project at pediatric grand rounds or at a poster session during the global pediatrics track graduation. Further curriculum details are found in The Minnesota Model. 4 The first cohort of pediatric and medicine-pediatric residents graduated in 2008. Since then, an average of 54% of residents on the track completed the requirements to receive a global pediatrics track certificate. The skills training component of the pre-travel preparation evolved to become a standalone curriculum known as the Procedural Education for Adaptation to Resource-Limited Settings (PEARLS). 5 PEARLS is a modular package of procedural skills taught in a hands-on workshop during which participants are given the opportunity to practice skills prior to their global pediatric elective. 6 As opportunities in global pediatrics training have expanded, there have been increasing calls for more robust evaluation of the outcomes of such training. Understanding outcomes of global health training can inform further development of global pediatrics education. 1, 7 To date, evaluations of global health education have focused mainly on immediate outcomes, such as changes in medical knowledge, clinical skills, and career plans. Most of these outcomes have been evaluated shortly after trainees participate in a global health elective or training program, with few studies evaluating longer term impacts of global health participation. [8] [9] [10] The impacts of global health residency tracks on post-residency career choices, long-term engagement in global health, and changes in clinical practice have not been widely studied.",

In a 2016 survey of graduating pediatric residents, 42% reported career plans to participate in global health domestically or internationally. 12 In the second, a survey of practicing pediatricians in 2017, 32% reported plans to work in a low-or middle-income country and 5.1% reported overseas global health experiences in the previous 12 months. 16 Respondents' interest in working in global health remained largely constant from before to after track participation, likely reflecting their self-selection into a global health track, similar to the conclusion of the study by Gupta et al. 11 of Yale internal medicine residents. However, respondents reported that their specific interests were influenced by participation in the track, including sub-specialty choice, increased interest in global research and public health, as well as working with immigrant and refugee populations.

Second, recall bias and selection bias are inherent in survey data. It is possible that individuals who were engaged in global health work were more likely to respond than those who were not at the time of the survey. Third, the survey was sent during the first wave of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, perhaps limiting participation. Our data may underrepresent the actual number of our graduates involved in global pediatrics activities and careers.

Nonetheless, the number of respondents is comparable to similar studies evaluating global health education in pediatric training programs.
