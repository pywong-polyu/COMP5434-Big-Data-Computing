Here, we provide a comprehensive description of all the conditions that must be fulfilled to successfully accomplish this transformation. Strong support from all hospital departments was crucial, as their activity was modified by the change. Healthcare workers from various units, notably the paediatric anaesthesiology department, worked in the adult ICU to ensure sufficient staffing. The number of physiotherapists and psychologists was increased. A support system for both healthcare workers and patients' relatives was set up with the help of the mobile paediatric palliative care and support team. Supplies suitable for adults were ordered. Protocols for numerous procedures were written within a few days. Video tutorials, checklists, and simulation sessions were circulated to the entire staff. The head nurses guided and supported the new staff and usual PICU staff. The transformation was achieved within a week. The main difficulties were healthcare worker stress, changes in recommendations over time, absence of visits from relatives, and specific adult issues that paediatricians are unfamiliar with.",

Concomitantly, admissions to paediatric ICU (PICU) decreased. The ethical principle of fair resource allocation therefore required the sharing of resources. Instead of sending material and human resources to adult hospitals, we chose to transform our unit into an adult ICU for Covid-19 patients and to create the few PICU beds that remained necessary in another part of the hospital. This allowed us to manage 31 adults with Covid-19 during a 5-week period, without suffering any shortage of PICU beds. A few recent articles have reported clinical characteristics and outcomes of adult patients admitted to PICU [1] or have pointed out adult specificities and considerations that must be taken into account [2] [3] [4] .",

For instance, pharmacists ordered chronic medications for adults, as well as specific ICU and Covid-19 drugs, creating a specific adult drug booklet to minimize errors between adult and paediatric medications. The biologists modified the panel of available tests to make it suitable for adults. Thus, the bacteriologists implemented new polymerase chain reaction techniques to detect the SARS Cov-2 virus and all the main bacteria responsible for coinfections.",

Ninety-day mortality was 16% (5 patients). Furthermore and most importantly, there was no collateral damage on critically ill paediatric patients during this period. No shortage of bed occurred in any of the Ile-de-France region PICU thanks to the decrease in PICU patients induced by both the lockdown and the massive deprogramming of surgeries. In addition, in our facility and despite having to deal with a new environment (the emergency department) and with new staff members, the care for critically ill children was kept to the same level as usual.",

Our experience and the similarity of the management of ARDS in adults and in children [11, 12] suggest that it may be easier for a PICU team to set up its own adult unit rather than to move paediatric staff to an unfamiliar adult setting.",
