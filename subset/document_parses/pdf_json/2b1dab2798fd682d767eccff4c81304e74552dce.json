Social media can be viewed as an intelligent platform that can be augmented with a capability to analyze and predict various issues such as business needs, environmental needs, election trends (polls), governmental needs, etc. This has motivated us to initiate a comprehensive search of the COVID-19 pandemic-related views and opinions amongst the population on Twitter. The basic training data have been collected from Twitter posts. On this basis, we have developed research involving ensemble deep learning techniques to reach a better prediction of the future evolutions of views in Twitter when compared to previous works that do the same. First, feature extraction is performed through an N-gram stacked autoencoder supervised learning algorithm. The extracted features are then involved in a classification and prediction involving an ensemble fusion scheme of selected machine learning techniques such as decision tree (DT), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and K-nearest neighbour (KNN). all individual results are combined/fused for a better prediction by using both mean and mode techniques. Our proposed scheme of an N-gram stacked encoder integrated in an ensemble machine learning scheme outperforms all the other existing competing techniques such unigram autoencoder, bigram autoencoder, etc. Our experimental results have been obtained from a comprehensive evaluation involving a dataset extracted from open-source data available from Twitter that were filtered by using the keywords \"covid\", \"covid19\", \"coronavirus\", \"covid-19\", \"sarscov2\", and \"covid_19\".",

For the given tweet document sentiment, analysis plays a vital task in classifying the polarity score which indicates to express the people opinion like positive, negative or neutral. Beyond that sentiment analysis people can share their emotions like anticipation, anger, fear, sadness, joy, trust and disgust [18, 19] . From this tweet information public health authorities can monitor, behaviors, surveillance of health information and it reduce the pandemic's impact. Similarly understanding people's needs, this data can help health care workers in monitoring and health data surveillance, behaviors, and planning intervention to decrease pandemic impact.

Calculate the average sentiment score of tweet and ratio of negative sentiment tweets. Then detect the inside and outside threats based on the concept of information security compliance. Internal threat was categorized into three stages: High, Figure 5 shows the error rate of classifiers DT, SVM, RF, and KNN with N-gram stacked autoencoder. The error rate is calculated by comparing the sending and received words. In this work, prediction is compared with the real opinion of the public. Figure 6 shows that ROC curve of the unigram, bigram, and trigram stacked autoencoders using four classifiers. For evaluation of performance metric measures, we used true positive, true negative, false positive, and false negative values in order to calculate the accuracy, precision, and recall. In Figure 6 , the true positive rate and false positive rate can be seen for various classifiers namely SVM, RF, KNN and DT with N-Gram stacked auto-encoder. These are applied in training dataset; the true positive rate is high which shows that the effectiveness of the classifiers.",

            "text": "This research article has focused on a comprehensive real-time sentimental data analysis and predictions based on streaming data from Twitter, which are related to the dangerous COVID-19 pandemic. In this work, we are using the most standard classifiers: DT, KNN, RF, and SVM. The proposed N-gram stack autoencoder integrated within an ensemble machine learning scheme has been developed, validated, and benchmarked with competing schemes from the most recent and relevant literature. Hereby, the streaming API of Twitter, apache spark, and kafka were involved. One computes/performs a comprehensive sentimental analysis of those data both in offline and online mode. The matching process is computed/trained offline for related components. Then, in the online mode, the trained components involving the n-gram stacked autoencoder integrated in an ensemble machine learning scheme are used. The results have been evaluated/benchmarked/compared with five machine learning schemes involving various bigram and unigram models. When compared with existing algorithms, our proposed n-gram stacked autoencoder in the ensemble machine learning improves the accuracy and time required. The datasets were collected from streaming API since 20 March 2020; they were extracted by using the hash tags #covid-19 and #coronavirus. In social media, some tweets based on COVID contain information about death analysis or the rate and severity of COVID, which would induce negative thoughts. The performance analysis results outcomes show and validate that our novel proposed work significantly outperform all other competing techniques/schemes while considering accuracy, precision and recall. Our scheme reaches an accuracy of 87.75%, which is 4% to 10% greater than all the other competing related techniques. The comprehensive analysis of this proposed work provides information to society about taking precautions and helps people find reliable information about COVID-19 and connect with one another.",

These negative tweets can alert medical teams and the government to the emotions among the living population. Further knowing the emotions and opinions of the population, the government can generate positive news across social media and make people confident.",
