Recently, saliva samples have been suggested as an alternative sample. In the present study, we aimed to compare RT-PCR results in nasopharyngeal, oro-nasopharyngeal and saliva samples of COVID-19 patients. 98 of 200 patients were positive in RT-PCR analysis performed before the hospitalization. On day 0, at least one sample was positive in 67 % of 98 patients. The positivity rate was 83 % for both oronasopharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples, while it was 63 % for saliva samples (p < 0.001). On day 5, RT-PCR was performed in 59 patients, 34 % had at least one positive result. The positivity rate was 55 % for both saliva and nasopharyngeal samples, while it was 60 % for oro-nasopharyngeal samples. Our study shows that the sampling saliva does not increase the sensitivity of RT-PCR tests at the early stages of infection. However, on the 5th day, viral RNA detection rates in saliva were similar to nasopharyngeal and oro-nasopharyngeal samples. In conclusion, we suggest that, in patients receiving treatment, RT-PCR in saliva, in addition to the standard samples, is important to determine the isolation period and control transmission.",

However, many individuals remain asymptomatic during the infection but have been a major factor in increasing the transmission rate of the disease and evolving it into a pandemic (Huang et al., 2020; Guan et al., 2020) . Although the diagnosis is based on clinical findings, the detection of the virus in patients' specimens is of great importance in detecting asymptomatic individuals and monitoring the contagious period in symptomatic individuals. This situation reveals the need for a fast, reliable, easily applicable, and non-invasive test. Currently, the gold standard method in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is the detection of viral RNA in the nasopharyngeal swab sample by Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) analysis (Lippi et al., 2020) . The most important disadvantage of this method is the presence of limited trained personnel available in sampling and the high risk of nosocomial infections that such personnel is exposed to. As the main source of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection is salivary droplets, viral RNA RT-PCR in saliva samples have been suggested as possible alternative testing (Khurshid et al., 2020) . Here, we compared the viral RNA RT-PCR results in nasopharyngeal, oro-nasopharyngeal, and saliva samples in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 to investigate their possible relationships with clinical findings.",

Before the saliva collection, participants were given brief explanations about the difference between saliva and sputum, then they were asked to give saliva samples prior to other samples by a drooling technique. They spit approximately 1 mL into the falcon tubes containing the viral transport medium (VTM, Innomed VTM001) used in standard sampling. Single trained healthcare professional took samples to avoid possible variations in the collection technique.

Our results also revealed that at the early stages of the infection, saliva sampling had a lower sensitivity to detect viral RNA compared to other sampling methods. Although some recent studies have shown similar results to ours, there are also other studies suggesting that saliva samples are compatible with the results of nasopharyngeal samples starting from the early period of the disease (Azzi et al., 2020 , Pasomsub et al., 2020 Chong et al., 2020 , Jamal et al., 2020 Kim et al., 2020; Kojima et al., 2020; Yokota et al., 2020 , Yee et al., 2020 Santos et al., 2020) . Some researchers suggest that saliva sampling can allow for an efficient, relatively inexpensive surveillance system however, they also point to the need for pilot studies (Fogarty et al., 2020 , Medeiros da Silva et al., 2020 . In this study, we consecutively recruited 200 inpatients who presented with clinical signs compatible with Covid-19 and at initial testing 98 of them revealed SARS-COV-2 RT-PCR positivity. The sensitivity rate for saliva samples was 63 % and this was significantly lower than nasopharyngeal and oro-nasopharyngeal swabs. However, our data Table 1 RT-PCR study results of saliva, oronasopharyngeal and nasopharyngeal samples on day 0 in 98 patients who were found positive in RT-PCR analysis before hospitalization. We would like to remind that of 98 patients, 66 (67 %) had at least one positive result in saliva or swab samples. on the 5th day showed that the viral RNA detection rates in saliva samples were similar to those of nasopharyngeal and oro-nasopharyngeal samples. Two similar studies supported our results and showed that SARS-CoV-2 detection from saliva was more consistent during extended hospitalization and recovery (Azzi et al., 2020; . A recent study also reported less variation in levels of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the saliva specimens than in the nasopharyngeal swab specimens in inpatients during the clinical course (Wyllie et al., 2020) . Thus, we suggest that RT-PCR analysis in saliva samples may be beneficial when a follow-up test beyond day 5 is needed especially in hospitalized patients (e.g. before discharge). Compared to nasopharyngeal swabs, sampling saliva causes less discomfort in patients and reduces the risk for nosocomial infection among healthcare workers as patients can give saliva samples by themselves.",

The fact that all of these patients were using hydroxychloroquine prior to hospitalization, may have hindered the detection of the virus in nasopharyngeal and oro-nasopharyngeal samples. However, it was not possible to suggest by what mechanism hydroxychloroquine caused such variation and novel studies are needed on this subject. With this result, we suggest that taking saliva samples along with the standard method before ending the isolation in individuals treated with hydroxychloroquine can be effective in minimizing contamination in the community by reducing the false negativity rate. In addition, we recommend saliva sampling in patients who show progression despite at-home treatment. Such an approach would increase the detection of positive cases, thereby enabling more accurate planning of treatment, follow-up, and subsequent discharge.",
