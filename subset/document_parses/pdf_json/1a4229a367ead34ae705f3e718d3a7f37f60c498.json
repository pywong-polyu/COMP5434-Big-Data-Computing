We aimed to investigate how cytokines and depression symptoms develop with one-year follow-up and compare them with non-PTSD patients. Methods: The study had a longitudinal design with one-year follow-up measurements in an inpatient treatment setting at a psychiatric center in Norway. PTSD diagnoses were set using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). The first three measurements were at baseline (T 0 ), halfway (T 1 ) and at discharge (T 2 ) from a 12-week main stay, followed by a final measurement one year after discharge (T 3 ). Serum blood samples were collected on all four occasions. The Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II) was administered at T 0 , T 2 and T 3 . Results: Levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10) in PTSD patients were higher than in patients without PTSD at T 0 (p = 0.005 and 0.042). The PTSD patients had a higher average level of IL-10 across all four measurements (B = 1.62, Standard Error (SE) = 0.78, p = 0.037). The IL-10 levels in PTSD patients declined from T 0 to T 3 (p = 0.039). The PTSD patients were more depressed than non-PTSD patients at T 3 (p = 0.019).",

            "text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may develop following exposure to exceptionally traumatic events, 1 such as war, Abuse, rape, injuries, or natural disasters. 2 PTSD is characterized by re-experiencing or having vivid dreams of the stressor, avoidance of circumstances associated with it, inability to recall parts of the traumatic event, and increased psychological sensitivity. 3 Although PTSD has a rather low prevalence rate, ranging from 1.1 to 2.9% in Europe, 4 the societal costs and disability burden of PTSD are considered to be high. 5 Patients with PTSD exhibit a low-grade proinflammatory state with altered levels of neuroimmune markers such as cortisol, c-reactive protein (CRP) [6] [7] [8] [9] and pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines like interleukin-6 (IL-6) and interleukin-10 (IL-10). [10] [11] [12] Depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability worldwide with 4.4% of the global population affected in 2015. 13 Dysregulation of inflammatory processes is known to be associated with depressive disorder, 14 and it is established that inflammatory processes influence both the development and progression of the disease. 15, 16 These inflammatory processes include increased levels of peripheral cytokines like interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). 14, 17, 18 It is unclear exactly how cytokines induce or drive depression, but one hypothesis is that cytokines stimulate synthesis of enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in brain microglia, resulting in an overall decrease in serotonin and an increase in glutamatergic activity. 16 Depression co-occurs in around 60% of PTSD patients. Patients with co-morbid PTSD and depression often have higher Mental and physical Healthcare utilization and a more chronic progression than patients with PTSD only. 19 Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity might be a shared pathway 20 of PTSD 21 and depression. 22 The pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-6 23 and the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 are associated with both PTSD and depressive disorder. [24] [25] [26] [27] Co-occurring PTSD and depression are two highly debilitating conditions that result in reduced life quality and poorer health than either disorder alone. 19, 28 To the best of our knowledge, there are no longitudinal studies assessing the development of inflammatory markers and depression symptoms in PTSD inpatients with long follow-up. The vast majority of previous studies on inflammation, PTSD and depression are cross-sectional, 9, 29 thus not providing sufficient insight into whether levels increase or decrease over time. We aimed to assess whether PTSD patients with depression symptoms would exhibit a more profound pro-inflammatory profile over time than patients with anxiety, eating and depression disorders, and to consider this in light of self-reported depression symptoms.",

            "text": "The patient sample consisted of a mixed-diagnosis group of inpatients in treatment at Modum Bad Psychiatric Center, a specialized treatment center in Vikersund, Norway. The center has a 12-week treatment program for individuals and groups. The staff at Modum Bad is multidisciplinary and consists of psychiatrists, nurses, psychologists, pastoral staff, art therapists and occupational therapists. The center offers treatment to patients with long-standing or treatment-resistant depression, anxiety and eating disorders, in addition to those who have been exposed to psychological trauma. The treatment involves various disorder-specific methods, such as cognitive therapy, metacognitive therapy, and traditional psychotherapy. The use of psychotropic medication is reduced to a minimum while in treatment. Some patients did use NSAIDs, anti-viral drugs and immune suppressants. The use of medication was recorded by searching each patient's medical record. Patients who are referred to Modum Bad have tried treatment elsewhere but failed to achieve remission. The center does not offer treatment to patients who have a substance abuse disorder, are psychotic, or in an active suicidal state. Being eligible for treatment at the center was the only inclusion criterion for participation in the study. Thus, all patients admitted to treatment from March 2015 until April 2016 were invited to participate in the study. Groups of eight participants were given a 15-minute oral presentation of the study by the first author on one of the first days of their main stay. The procedures were explained, and an information brochure was handed out together with the consent form. Participants returned the signed consent form within a day or two. The patient sample consisted of those who attended both the 12-week main treatment stay and the one-week follow-up stay one year after discharge from the center. Of the 147 participants attending the main stay, 57 did not attend the follow-up stay, giving a total of 90 patients (61%) in the study. Data collection commenced in 2015 and lasted for about a year. The patients who returned for a one-week stay one year after discharge re-submitted their blood samples and filled out the BDI-II questionnaire one final time.",

These biomarkers were chosen since they have frequently been assessed in previous immunopsychiatric studies, thus allowing for comparisons with the available literature. Longitudinal controls were used to validate inter-assay variation: IL-6 (16%) and IL-10 (5.7%). The mean inter-assay percentage coefficient of variability for all blood sample plates was 10.4%.

The Kruskal-Wallis equality of populations test for equal ranks was used for a variable comprising three groups. Multilevel models were utilized to assess the continuous longitudinal dependent cytokine variables. 36 Multilevel models incorporated all four measurements from T 0 to T 3 , using all available data. Hence, a patient with missing data at one time point will still be included and contribute to an estimation based on available data from other time points. The use of multilevel models constituted a two-level structure of blood samples at level one, nested within patients at level two. In this way, the dependency of measurements within patients was handled. Maximum likelihood was used for parameter estimation as this approach is recommended for small samples (below 100) and less than 70% missing data, thus providing a reliable solution for handling missing data. 37 The covariance was set to unstructured. The longitudinal cytokine variables were skewed (skewness 6.52 for IL-6 and 8.41 for IL-10), and robust standard errors were applied to account for the nonnormal distribution. 38 The multilevel models were tested with random intercept variation and random slope to assess the best model fit. Likelihood ratio tests revealed that a more complex model, including both random intercept variation and random slope, provided a better fit for IL-6 and IL-10 (\u03c7 2 (2) = 342.97, p = <0.001 and \u03c7 2 (2) = 583.05, p = <0.001, respectively). This indicated that allowing patients\u00b4cytokine levels to vary at T 0 , as well as varying across time, gave the best fit. In contrast, for BDI-II, a model with random intercept variation only provided a better fit than the more complex model with random slope (\u03c7 2 (2) = 0.55, p = 0.760). Q-Q plots and scatter plots of the predicted residuals of the cytokine variables were constructed to determine whether there were any outliers which violated assumptions of normal residual distribution. Three patients were identified as violating that assumption, and the models were tested without those individuals. This exclusion did not alter any p-values to any great extent. Hence, they were kept in the analysis presented. The alpha level was set at 0.05 for statistical significance, and all tests were two-tailed, but trends (p<0.10) were also reported. All statistical analyses were conducted with Stata (StataCorp. 2019, Stata Statistical Software: Release 16, College Station, TX, USA: StataCorp LLC). Table 1 shows the proportions of detectable cytokines at T 0 -T 3 , categorized across PTSD diagnosis. The detection rate of IL-6 was higher for PTSD patients at T 0 (p = 0.001), T 1 (p = 0.013) and T 2 (p = 0.008). In addition, the detection rate of IL-10 was higher for PTSD patients at T 1 (p = 0.030) and T 2 (p = 0.035). At the final observation after one year, there were no differences between PTSD patients and non-PTSD patients in cytokine detection levels. Table 2 presents the mean levels of IL-6, IL-10, and BDI-II at baseline. The patients aged 30 and above had higher levels of IL-6 than those under 30 years (p = 0.040). PTSD patients had higher levels of IL-6 (p = 0.005) and IL-10 (p = 0.042). Patients with childhood trauma had higher levels of IL-10 (p = 0.006). Table 3 shows results of statistical tests that are visualized in Figure 1 . There was a significant main effect of PTSD on anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 (B = 1.62, SE = 0.78, p = 0.037), indicating that PTSD patients had higher levels of IL-10 on average across the four measurements. Furthermore, there were several trends to be observed in the data. There was a trend toward a higher level of IL-6 in the PTSD patients (B = 1.20, SE = 0.70, p = 0.086). There was also a trend effect of PTSD on BDI-II (B = 4.01, SE = 2.17, p = 0.057). Figure 1 shows that IL-6 levels were higher in PTSD patients compared to non-PTSD patients at T 0 (p = 0.005), T 1 (p = 0.031) and T 2 (p = 0.005), but not at T 3 . Figure 2 shows that the IL-10 levels were higher in PTSD patients at the same time points (p = 0.042, 0.011 and 0.004, respectively). The PTSD patients exhibited reduced IL-10 levels from T 0 to T 3 (Wilcoxon signed rank test; p = 0.039). Figure 3 shows that patients without PTSD had a reduced BDI score from T 0 to T 3 (p < 0.001). PTSD patients had more depressive symptoms than non-PTSD patients at T 3 (p = 0.019).",

There was also a trend that the initial higher levels of IL-6 in the Chronic depression is more often found in patients with PTSD. 39 PTSD may act as a factor sustaining depression, reducing the prospects of remission, previously suggested to be driven by the underlying inflammatory processes with a high subjective feeling of stress. 40 Furthermore, having PTSD with co-occurring depression disorder is associated with greater likelihood of current suicidal ideation and lifetime suicide attempts compared to those with PTSD alone, 28 underscoring that these patients are worse off as a result of the comorbidity. This burden of co-morbidity is reflected at the inflammatory level, as seen in a study with a small sample size showing that IL-6 levels in PTSD patients both with and without depressive disorder were significantly reduced following administration of hydrocortisone, but IL-6 levels were still higher in patients with both PTSD and depressive disorder than in those with PTSD alone. 1 This highlights the complexity of the psychoneuroimmunological interface in the comorbidity of PTSD and depression and might be either a contributing factor or a symptom of the high depression burden. PTSD and depressive disorder are characterized as disorders of inflammation and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysfunction. 41 However, depressed patients both with and without PTSD are known to have high inflammatory levels. 42, 43 It is difficult to draw conclusions from the present data as to whether the high levels of IL-6 and IL-10 in the PTSD patients are caused by a depressive trait, or if the traumatic experiences themselves are the origin.",

            "text": "A review by Kim et al reported that elevated levels of IL-10 in PTSD patients have been shown in previous studies; however, other studies have reported IL-10 to be reduced in these patients. 44 The authors suggested that this biomarker might not be suitable to provide insight into the pathophysiology of PTSD. However, both elevated and reduced levels of IL-10 are in line with the current study, as IL-10 was elevated at the main stay and reduced at the follow-up. We believe that this contradiction only underscores the necessity of measuring cytokines over a long period, as such biomarkers will develop differently over time depending on numerous factors. The reduced cytokine levels at follow-up could be due to a variety of factors. Patients in inpatient settings usually experience improved sleep quality as a result of following a daily structure with fixed schedules, as well as eating regular and nutritious meals. Well-regulated sleeping and eating patterns have previously been reported to reduce inflammation in psychiatric patients. 45, 46 It is still uncertain whether therapy in itself reduces inflammation, as there are few robust studies on this topic to date, and our research group has previously found no associations between therapy and cytokines. 47 However, one systematic review on cognitive behavioral therapy and inflammation found at least one inflammatory marker to be reduced in 14 out of 23 studies. 48 Further, the review found three papers which reported that high pre-treatment inflammatory levels predicted poorer outcome from cognitive behavioral therapy. These findings may explain why cytokine levels were reduced, but with a different trajectory in individuals with PTSD.",

It must be taken into consideration that we do not know if the patients received other kinds of treatment during the one-year follow-up period, or if they used any kind of medication that could have affected the inflammatory levels. Further, the blood samples at the main stay and at follow-up were analyzed in two separate batches. The use of different equipment for analysis suggests that the blood sample results could be biased and might not be directly comparable. Further, some patients had eaten breakfast before blood samples were collected, while others were fasting, which might have affected cytokine production. 49 We did not record whether patients had been smoking or exercising prior to blood sampling. Smoking and exercise are known to affect cytokine levels. 50, 51 In addition, their body mass index was not recorded and adipose tissue is known to produce inflammatory cytokines. 52 All patients who failed to submit complete measures of BDI-II were among those who did not attend the one-year follow-up. This may have represented a selection bias, as patients who did not participate in the follow-up stay might have had poorer mental health than those who were present at follow-up. This study also has strengths that should be pointed out. This study is the first to include four measurement points in a sample of depressed PTSD patients, where the final measurement point is at one-year follow-up. This approach provides a new perspective on the development of inflammatory levels and psychometric scores over a long follow-up period.",
