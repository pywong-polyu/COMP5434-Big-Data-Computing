However, several open questions challenge the triumph of controlling/ending the pandemic by vaccination. One major concern is the ability of the virus to mutate and evolve; this potentially can cause SARS-CoV-2 to partially escape from the immune system, which will reduce the effectiveness of the vaccine in preventing disease and viral transmission. Determining vaccine efficacy against variants of concern (VOC) 1 is vital for planning and modifying vaccination strategies.",

Both in clinical trials and in real world studies, the BNT162b2 vaccine has proven to be highly effective in both averting infections and preventing severe disease and death. [2] [3] [4] [5] The Israeli vaccination campaign took place during the third and largest wave of the pandemic (see Figure 1 ). During this third wave, the B.1.1.7 variant became the dominant strain in Israel, reaching over 95% dominance. 6 Since the detection of the B.1.1.7 variant in November 2020 in the United Kingdom, it has spread rapidly and become the dominant strain in many countries.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] The B.1.351 strain, which was first documented in South Africa, is also considered a VOC mainly because in vitro experiments have demonstrated its ability to overcome previous immunity to SARS-CoV2. Specifically, experimental work demonstrated significant decrease in neutralization capacity of B.1.351. 8 However other research found that neutralizing antibodies remained sufficiently high against the B.1.351 variant. 9 Humoral protection measured by antibody responses and neutralization studies do not assess the role of cellular immunity mediated by T-cell responses. A recent study has shown that the cellular protection established following previous infection or vaccination remains high against both the B.1.1.7 and the B.1.351 variants. 10 On the other hand, two real world studies have raised concern that the BNT162b2 vaccine has reduced efficacy against the B.1.351 variant. A study from Qatar has shown that the efficacy of BNT162b2 against the B.1.351 variant was ~75% compared to ~90% against the B.1.1.7 variant. 11 A second study from Israel has estimated that the odds ratio (OR), in a matched study of SARS-Cov-2 cases occurring in unvaccinated persons versus persons who had received their second dose of vaccine at least one week previous to sample collection, was 1/8, implying considerably lower efficacy of the vaccine against the B.1.351 variant. 6 Thus, our goal was to further quantify the risk of the B.1.135 variant causing a significant breakthrough in a real world environment.",

The estimated OR (Table 3 ) was 1.29, with a P-value of 0.46 and 95% confidence limits ranging from 0.66 to 2.50. Note that the estimated OR was larger than one even though the crude proportion of B.1.351 was slightly lower (3.2% v 3.5%) among the vaccinated cases. This was due to the regression adjustment for the confounders age and subpopulation -younger age and ultra-orthodox Jews both had a negative association with the B.1.351 variant. Using the estimated OR, assuming that the vaccine efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant is 95% 2-5 , the estimated efficacy against the B.1.351 variant is estimated to be 93% with 95% confidence limits between 87% and 97%.

One can show (see Supplementary Information) that: OR = (1-VB.1.351)/(1-VB.1.1.7) where V B.1.351 is the vaccine efficacy against the B.1.351 variant, and VB.1.1.7 is the vaccine efficacy against the B.1.1.7 variant. Thus, assuming that VB.1.1.7 is estimated well from observational studies of vaccine efficacy conducted in Israel (e.g., 95%), we estimated the vaccine efficacy against the B.1.351 variant from: VB.1.351 = 1 -OR(1-VB.1.1.7)",

            "text": "In this regard, the B.1.1.7 variant is about 50% more infectious than the original Wuhan strain 7 , leading to the subsequent global dominance of B.1.1.7. This higher transmission rate requires higher vaccine coverage to allow relaxation of social distancing and other non-pharmaceutical interventions while still curtailing new outbreaks. The second factor is vaccine breakthrough by VOC. Initially, evidence regarding the evolutionary dynamics governed by the relatively slow mutation rate bolstered the hope that VOC would not endanger the effectiveness of vaccination. However, concerns over reduced efficacy of the Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine arose after laboratory experiments estimated a large drop in sensitivity of the B.1.1.7 variant to sera collected from vaccinated individuals and an even larger reduction in sensitivity to convalescent sera. 8 The B.1.351 variant has caused further anxiety regarding the potential vaccine breakthrough due to the co-occurrence of supplementary mutations in the receptor-binding domain, which were proven to have a significantly increased resistance to vaccine-induced and convalescent sera. 15 Two real-world studies which examined the protection of the BNT162b2 vaccine against B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 found a substantial reduction in vaccine effectiveness against B.1.351 compared to B.1.1.7. 6,11 Results from a previous study in Israel based on a matched pairs case-case design pointed to a significant vaccine breakthrough of the B.1.351 compared to the B.1.1.7. The study had a modest sample size and period-length, and found eight B.1.351 breakthroughs compared to a single case of a B.1.17 breakthrough in the subgroup of nine discordant matched pairs (i.e., those for which the vaccinated and unvaccinated cases differed in the variant-type) of vaccinated persons receiving two vaccine doses and unvaccinated persons; 6 all these cases were PCR confirmed in a short time window, on days 7-13 after receiving the second dose. No positive individuals infected by the B.1.351 variant were found in vaccinated persons more than two weeks after the second dose even though about half of the vaccinated cases were from that later time frame. The investigators speculated that \"this cohort may have been infected before the immunity from the boost was fully established, and it is thus possible that enhanced immunity from the boost, which develops over time, may more effectively prevent infection with the B.1.351 variant.\" study, a much larger number of vaccinated and unvaccinated cases was included. In addition, our main analysis focused on vaccinated cases infected with B.1.351 or B.1.1.7 occurring more than two weeks after their second dose and did not find a statistically significant reduction in protection of the vaccine. However, a sub-analysis of our study, which examined vaccinated cases occurring only 1-13 days after the second dose found an increased proportion of B.1.351 compared to unvaccinated cases with an estimated OR of 2.62. It is important to mention that, although both studies were conducted in Israel, there is no overlap of data between the two studies. Integrating the information and findings from both studies, supports the hypothesis that a higher level of immunity is required for protection against the B.1.351 variant, thus inducing different levels of efficacy against the B.1.351 and B.1.1.7 variants during the first two weeks after the boost from the second dose. 16 The fact that the B.1.351 variant, that was first diagnosed in Israel January 2021, concomitantly with the start of the vaccination program, has not caused significant community transmission in Israel is further encouraging evidence supporting the ability of two doses of the BNT162b2 vaccine combined with high coverage to halt transmission. A second study used a test-negative design to examine the efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine in Qatar, 11 and found that the vaccine efficacy was 89.5% (95% CI:[85.9-92.3]) against the B.1.1.7 variant but only 75% (95% CI:[70.5-78.9]) against the B.1.351 variant, at least 14 days after the second dose. In contrast, several large studies from Israel have shown that the efficacy of the BNT162b2 vaccine is close to 95% against infection during a time when the B.1.1.7 variant was predominant. 3-5 The difference in vaccine efficacies to the B.1.1.7 variant between the Qatar and Israeli studies could be due to the use of different methodologies to estimate vaccine efficacy, or different social, cultural, racial or environmental conditions; the latter potentially can affect the transmission dynamics and thus alter vaccine efficacy. The above differences could also explain the difference in vaccine breakthrough of the B.1.351 variant between the two countries. The current reduction in transmission seen in Qatar after the vaccination campaign gives further support to the ability of the BNT162b2 vaccine to control the spread of the B.1.351 variant.",

Thus, the database has over-representation of vaccinated cases, and also over-representation of the B.1.351 variant among cases in Israel. In order to test the robustness of our results, we used two different statistical methods, unconditional logistic regression and conditional logistic regression with matching to estimate the OR. Both analyses revealed no statistically significant difference, and indicated that any reduction in the vaccine efficacy against B.1.351 relative to B.1.1.7 is at the most marginal with an OR not exceeding 2.5. In addition, we have shown in computer simulations that this type of selection should not introduce bias into the estimation of the odds ratio of a vaccinated case having the B.1.351 variant (see Supplemental Information for details). The criterion for validly using such a database for estimating the OR is that the selection of vaccinated cases or B.1.351 cases should be independent of each other; when selecting a vaccinated case this should be without regard to whether the case was B.1.17 or B.1.351, and when selecting a case suspected to be B.1.351 this should be without regard to whether the case was vaccinated or unvaccinated. As far as we can ascertain such conditions applied to the selection of cases for sequencing. Despite the concerns caused by the B.1.351 variant, the BNT162b2 vaccine seems to provide substantial immunity against both that variant and the B.1.1.7. Our results suggest that from 14 days following the second vaccine dose the efficacy of BNT162b2 vaccine is at most marginally affected by the B.1.351 variant. The next generation of vaccines will include modifications to better deal with different VOC; nevertheless, the current vaccines may still provide substantial immunity against both current and future VOC.
