Similar efforts aiming to prevent the global spread of the disease are of strategic importance for the management and control of the outbreak [7] . Especially data on the knowledge and attitudes of healthcare professionals before the outbreak may be used to prepare targeted training sessions during the outbreak, reduce exposure, and guide the priorities of policymakers by determining key person-oriented points that can facilitate the control of the spread [4] . The purpose of this study, which was conducted a week before the first case was reported in Turkey, is to evaluate the knowledge, perceptions, and attitudes of physician faculty members, nurses, and medical students who work in a training hospital in Istanbul, the most populated city in Turkey, where there were no cases at the time, regarding COVID-19.",

The present study was conducted on three different groups, namely physician faculty members, nurses, and medical students. When assessing the responses to propositions, the findings showed that the knowledge of healthcare professionals on COVID-19 was generally sufficient. While the most well-known facts among the research population were the symptoms of COVID-19, the need to isolate patients and the mode of transmission, the least known facts were the lack of a COVID-19 vaccine, the use of PCR for diagnosis, and the need to take nasopharyngeal aspirate samples. In addition, it was found that physicians answered the questions about propositions relating to COVID-19 more accurately than nurses. Among studies evaluating the knowledge of healthcare professionals during the outbreak, the level of knowledge of physicians was found to be higher in this study than in studies conducted not only on physicians and nurses but also on heterogeneous groups with less direct contact with patients, such as administrative staff, pharmacists, dentists, and technicians [5, 7, 8] .",

Although the majority of participants correctly answered the questions about false propositions, some participants still claimed that there was a vaccine for COVID-19, that there was a definitive treatment for COVID-19, and that flu vaccines provided protection against COVID-19. It is unfortunate that there were gaps in the knowledge of healthcare professionals when the globally-destructive COVID-19 outbreak was dominating the headlines and it was only a matter of time before it affected Turkey. The lack of knowledge on topics, such as sampling or the use of PCR for diagnosis, indicates that the topics of infectious diseases and epidemics in the vocational education of physicians, nurses, and medical students need to be updated, although accurate and reliable information is easily and rapidly accessible. In addition, the education of healthcare professionals and the provision of different resources to them by policymakers are important elements for success in the fight against the outbreak. The first case was reported in Turkey on March 11. The \"2019-nCoV Healthcare Professionals Guide\" was published on January 24 before the outbreak began in Turkey [9] . When this study was conducted, which was a week before the first case was reported, the outbreak was rapidly becoming severe worldwide. It is vital to provide accurate and reliable information when preparing for an outbreak. Despite the uncertainty and panic, the guides prepared by official health authorities can improve the knowledge of healthcare professionals who are on the frontlines of this battle, make it easier to keep track of updates and provide reliable and objective data. Only 36% (n=221) of the participants knew about the guide prepared for this purpose [10] . This rate increased when the first case was reported in Turkey. Two-thirds of the participants stated social media as a source of information about COVID-19. It is worrying that social media, where unreliable and unverified information spreads rapidly, is the primary source of information for physicians, nurses, and medical students. Nearly half of these individuals (45%) also followed the official website of the Ministry of Health. Considering that the outbreak had not yet begun in Turkey when this study was conducted, some changes in these rates may be expected with the increasing role and visibility of the Ministry of Health during the outbreak. In a similar study conducted nearly a month after the first case was reported in Turkey, the rate of people who followed the website of the Ministry of Health was 64.6%. This result proves the increasing role of the Ministry of Health with the spread of COVID-19 to the country [11] .",

The most common situations that caused stress among physicians and nurses were \"Inadequacy of protective measures,\" \"Possibility of the transmission of COVID-19 from a patient in the hospital,\" and \"Diagnosis of a family member with COVID-19\" (72.4%). The findings showed that the causes of stress for healthcare professionals were different during the phase of preparation for the outbreak when no cases had been reported yet. The uncertainty about the disease and the knowledge and experience of individuals may affect the levels of anxiety and stress. Protective measures, concerns about the transmission (to family members or colleagues), news in the media, a lack of treatment, and uncertainties relating to matters, such as when the outbreak, will end may affect the answers of individuals on psychological issues. Similar situations were asked in the form of propositions in a similar study in which Cai H. et al. [18] examined the psychological effects of COVID-19 on healthcare professionals in Hubei, China and their coping strategies for these effects. In this study, physicians and nurses were asked about similar stressful situations, and it was found that they were causes of stress for less than 70% of these individuals. Given that the levels of stress for each situation were higher in the study of Cai et al. than in ours may show the difference in the levels of stress in different phases of the outbreak, which may indicate that many factors, such as working conditions, measures taken at the national level and the reactions of society to the outbreak and the measures caused the levels of stress to be higher. The fact that COVID-19 is a potentially fatal disease that may be transmitted from person to person and is associated with high morbidity rates may intensify the sense of personal danger during the outbreak [19] [20] [21] . This situation should be evaluated again with new studies that show the levels of stress of healthcare professionals in Turkey during the outbreak.",

Similarly, in this study one of the most common beliefs about COVID-19 was that it was a disease similar to seasonal influenza. The next most common belief was that it was a biological weapon and that it was created by pharmaceutical/vaccine companies. Although certain studies proved that the virus did not originate in a lab and even discussed potential sources of the virus, the negative effects of social media, which was the most common source of information for healthcare professionals, can be seen in their beliefs about the virus [29] . Internet users should question the source of the information they obtain. Misinformation is an important problem during public emergencies. It may lead to devastating consequences for health and the economy by creating panic, causing people to stockpile medical supplies or medicine, or worse, promoting potentially life-threatening malpractices.",

It is an important step to ensure that healthcare professionals feel safe as soldiers in the fight against the outbreak. Healthcare authorities should fulfill their responsibilities in this sense and provide support.",

Among the factors that could potentially have emerged when the pandemic started to affect the country, the most stressful factors were uncertainties, the inadequacy of protective measures, and the possibility of transmission. The fact that concerns about protection emerged before the outbreak, although these individuals were ready for the outbreak in the professional sense, should be considered by local and national health administrators when preparing for an outbreak. In addition, the advantages and disadvantages of the use of social media platforms as the main source of information should be assessed. This study is valuable since it evaluates the knowledge and perceptions of healthcare professionals and enables the analysis of the preparations before the outbreak as it was conducted a week before the first case was reported in Turkey. As the global COVID-19 threat and its effects continue to grow, our study provides a basis for monitoring the changes in the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of healthcare professionals. ",
