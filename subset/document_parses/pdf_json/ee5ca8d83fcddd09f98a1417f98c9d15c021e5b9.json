This article conducts a genealogical study that investigates the emergence of two differing masking strategies in two epidemic events in Chinese history. First, during the Manchurian plague 1910/11, it shows how the germ theory and historical anecdotes made anti-plague masks thinkable and practicable as a solution not only for airborne contagion but also for the biopolitical problem of 'unhygienic' population. In the second part, the analytical focus is shifted to the emergence of collective mask-wearing practices during SARS 2002/03 from the vantage point of subjectification. Facemasks then became a symbol of care in the neoliberal regime of responsibilization. This article concludes by arguing for a rethinking of facemasks as actants who actively participate in the constitution of the world we share.",

It is both a central component of the administratively prescribed strategies to contain the pandemic and-in addition to social distancing-the most widespread personal protective measure. That being said, the strategy of mass masking was not self-evident at the beginning of the Covid-19 outbreak. The act of mask-wearing was first perceived as a unique East Asian phenomenon as Covid-19 started to gain global media attention. Medical authorities outside of East Asia, including the WHO, were generally reluctant to impose mass masking in public. However, in early April 2020, an increasing number of governments in Western countries changed their facemask policy and started to issue guidelines for universal mask-wearing (Goldstein et al. 2020) . The use of facemasks by the general population was framed as an urgent and effective strategy to impede COVID-19 transmission (Gandhi et al. 2020; Howard et al. 2021; Holakouie-Naieni et al. 2020) .",

            "text": "Facemasks in times of COVID-19 are more than just biomedical devices covering one's mouth and nose. The global spread of the virus has made them highly charged symbols in political debates, popular culture, and everyday interactions. In order to make sense of their dynamic symbolic meanings, an increasing number of social and cultural studies on masks have been published since the outbreak of COVID-19. Studying the socio-material meanings of COVID facemasks, Lupton et al. (2021: 84) reveal \"the manifold complexities, forces and intra-actions of symbolism, discourse, politics, culture, and embodiment in which the face mask in COVID is entangled.\" Ma and Zhan (2020) make visible social stigmatization experienced by masked Chinese students in America. The so-called 'mask culture' is criticised by Zhang (2021) as an Orientalist discourse that perpetuates and reproduces stereotypes about Asian people. Last but not least, Han (2020: 6) reveals how Chinese official facemask narratives have constructed mask-wearing \"as a deontic value that all citizens should embrace\". This article, however, does not engage directly with the present-day phenomena of masking, but rather its 'history of the present' (Roth 1981; Dean 1994; Garland 2014) . From a genealogical perspective, meanings are historically contingent and are only fixated through the operation of power (Foucault 1984) . It is therefore important to pay attention to the process of meaning-making that is located in specific historical contexts. To be more specific, this article traces the genealogy of masking in the history of modern China. Genealogy is, however, different from history. A conventional history of facemasks may simply juxtapose different designs of masks from different periods in a temporally linear and continual order. This, however, often runs the risk of technological determinism. Genealogists, on the other hand, focus on discontinuities and multiple processes of emergence. It is a reflexive art of problematization that traces how power struggles and contingency are constitutive of the emergence of contemporary practices and institutions (Garland 2014: 372) . In this sense, a genealogical study of masks does not intend to formulate a sweeping social theory of masking, but to develop some heuristic tools that make sense of and problematize present-day masking practices.",

Schematically speaking, it examines two kinds of masking strategies: One that is implemented in a top-down manner and one that is initiated by the public 'from below'. These two strategies emerge in two epidemic events. The first one concerns the birth of modern facemasks (gauze masks) in the context of the Manchurian plague 1910/11. The anti-plague mask was first made thinkable by new forms of medical knowledge and historical anecdotes, then implemented as a biopolitical strategy aiming at an 'unhygienic' population, and finally celebrated as a symbol of \"hygienic modernity\" (Rogaski 2004) . The second moment witnessed the emergence of collective mask-wearing practices in the context of SARS 2002/03. The central question this time was not so much a medico-political one concerning implementing masking policy, but rather an ethical question on wearing them. How are people incited to recognize their obligations to wear facemasks? During the SARS outbreak, facemasks became a symbol of care in the neoliberal regime of responsibilization. In the last section, this article will discuss how this genealogical study of masks can contribute to a rethinking in COVID times.",

            "text": "At the end of 1910, a year before the collapse of the Qing dynasty, a vehement plague ravaged Northern Manchuria. By the time the epidemic had waned in March 1911, it had cost more than 60,000 lives in total. The fatality rate proved to be 100%. The plague first made its appearance in Manzhouli, a Chinese town bordering on Russia. Along the railway lines and roads, the disease surged southwards to other cities in Manchuria-a vast territory contested by Japan, Russia, and Qing. At the outset of the outbreak, the Russians were quicker to react to the plague than the Qing government. The disease was first diagnosed in the Russian concession city of Harbin on 27 October and an improvised plague hospital was soon built (Gamsa 2006: 148) . At the same time, Japan was putting diplomatic pressure on Beijing while preparing to invade Manchuria from Korea. Both countries questioned Qing's ability to contain the plague and framed the plague epidemic as a political issue of international importance (Flohr 1996: 367; Bu 2017: 48) . Unlike previous plague events, which were 'perceived' by Qing as a regional or national issue, the outbreak this time posed a threat to Qing's sovereignty over Manchuria (Lei 2010: 77) . Instead of resorting to war and the army, which was a common solution to sovereignty problems, the outbreak of the Manchurian plague required the Qing government to resort to new strategies.",

            "text": "In the midst of this crisis, China's vice minister of foreign affairs, Shi Zhaoji (Alfred Sao-ke Sze, 1877-1958), recommended Dr. Wu Lien-teh, a Cambridgetrained physician, as the head of a medical team assigned to help fight the epidemics. Three days after his arrival in Fujiadian, a satellite town (inhabited mainly by the Chinese) within walking distance of the Russian-dominated city of Harbin, he dissected the first corpse of a plague victim and analyzed bacterial cultures from organ specimens (Lei 2014: 25) . It was soon clear to him that the organism under his microscope appeared to be identical with the Bacillus pestis that Kitasato Shibasaburo (1853 Shibasaburo ( -1931 and Alexandre Yersin (1863-1943) had co-discovered during the Hong Kong plague in 1894. But Wu observed a novel fact, namely that these bacilli were found exclusively in the victim's lungs, which could suggest that the plague this time was very different in nature from the one 17 years before. Wu then proposed a \"bold theory\" (Lynteris 2018: 444) that the plague in Manchuria had taken a pneumonic rather than a bubonic form. The latter had been the newly established knowledge about the plague among the international scientific community since the beginning of the third plague pandemic 15 years before. Wu believed that the plague in Manchuria was not transmitted by infected rat fleas but spread directly from person to person through the air. In order to block the spread of this contagious disease, he designed a gauze cotton mask and recommended that it be worn by doctors and paramedical staff who were involved in the containment of the plague (Wu 1926: 397f) . Although the design of Wu's mask resembled recently established surgical masks used in the operation room at the turn of the twentieth century, it was the first time that gauze masks were used in the context of epidemic control (Lynteris 2018: 444).",

What's more, the use of facemasks was a rather unthinkable strategy in the Chinese history of plague containment. How could a young physician like Wu, whose bold theory was somewhat contrary to the medical knowledge held by many senior foreign epidemiologists, convince Chinese officials to adopt gauze masks in epidemic control? What kinds of institutional, discursive, and strategic conditions needed to be created so that the use of anti-plague masks could become thinkable, feasible, and perhaps even indispensable?",

If contagion was mentioned, it tended to be understood as caused by a multitude of factors including for example the diqi (earth qi), moral degradation, or bad fengshui rather than by a single cause. Common responses to epidemics in Qing dynasty were \"charitable relief, cleanup campaigns, appeals to the plague gods, and participation in community ceremonies\" (Benedict 1996: 128) .

It legitimized a series of new anti-plague strategies including the use of masks during the plague in Manchuria. Some of these new measures such as forced quarantine and mass cremation were enforced so rigorously as to be perceived by Manchurian people as \"the most brutal policies seen in four thousand years\" (Lei 2010: 82) . However, the germ theory did not just 'come' through translation.

(Wu 1926: 393) In the previous section, the politics of mask-wearing has been primarily interrogated from a 'macro' perspective that focuses on medical, historical, and political discursive entanglements immanent in the emergence of anti-plague masks. In this part, the analytical attention will be shifted to a 'micro' perspective that gives emphasis to the formation of a particular 'pro-mask subjectivity'. The reason for such a shift of perspective has to do with the historical development of facemasks: During the 1918 influenza and especially in its more recent history in East Asia since 2000, the facemask has become a more popularized and individualized device of anti-contagion prophylaxis. The popularization of facemasks since SARS was accompanied largely by disposable surgical masks that progressively replaced the reusable cotton masks with the rise of throwaway culture from the 1960s (Strasser and Schlich 2020). Made of non-woven synthetic fibers, they were widely adopted because they are relatively inexpensive, convenient, and efficient. The 'economy' of surgical masks not only gave rise to a quantitative proliferation of masking practices but also qualitatively to new social meanings. During the SARS outbreak in 2002/3, surgical masks became a commodity that was actively purchased and, more importantly, a marker of care and solidarity in the zeitgeist of neoliberalism. While during the Manchurian plague, the use of gauze masks was rather initiated by medical authorities, in the wake of the twenty-first century, the situation was almost reversed: The general public in China was willing to wear facemasks during the SARS outbreak, even before masks were made obligatory. In what follows, this article attempts to handle these questions: Despite the controversy over the efficacy of facemasks, which factor gave rise to the seemingly 'voluntary', 'dutiful', and collective use of facemasks during the SARS epidemic? In which way were people incited to recognize their obligations to wear facemasks? What was the telos of this collective masking practice? What was the most salient experience during this time?",

(WHO 2006: 247) This remark also applies to the strategy of masking which emerged during the Manchurian plague 1910-11. Interestingly, similar to this plague event, the efficacy of mask-wearing was also a matter of controversy among international scientific communities during the SARS outbreak. In China, the initial stance at the beginning of the outbreak was even to \"ridicule the use of facemasks\" (Sin 2016: 91) . According to Dr. Lo Wing-lok, an authority in the field, he questioned the effectiveness of mask-wearing, commenting that \"as the tiny holes in a mask cannot filter out the viruses in the air, one can also breathe them in and get infected\". Following this remark, the Next Magazine then criticized an 'unscientific' public manner towards masking-wearing that \"everyone in the hospital, even the cashier behind the glass counter and the cleaning workers were wearing a mask or several masks\".

Another important observation was that before 2003, facemasks had rarely been seen in public areas in Hong Kong and mainland China, so the emergence of everyday masking practice was almost a rupture. Following Burgess and Horii (2012) 's insights into the popularization of masking practice in Japan, this article argues that to understand the similar process in the Chinese SARS context, it is vital to examine the formation of responsibilized subjects before the SARS outbreak.

For example, examining the Japanese language uses that express germs, dirt, and influenza, Horii (2012, 1184) argued that the practice of mask-wearing \"resonated with folk assumptions as making a barrier between purity and pollution\". At the same time, they were careful not to make any culturally essentialist claims as if there were a fixed cultural embracement of facemasks. Nevertheless, this specific cultural understanding of disease and risk intersects with the process of responsibilization of individuals in Japan since the 1990s, thus creating a specific subjectivity with a sense of individuated insecurity.",

However, they do not constitute the most salient factor here. After all, many people were wearing masks during the SARS outbreak before all these 'social determinants' could 'structure' their behavior. To understand this proactive practice, it is vital to shift attention to their ethical world and to explore their \"mode of subjection\" (\"mode d'assujettissement\") namely, \"the way in which people are invited or incited to recognize their moral obligations\" (Foucault 1984, 354 ).",

Although in cities, especially for those who belonged to a danwei (work unit), health care was largely understood to be the responsibility of the state or the collective, the majority of the population, especially those in the rural areas, were outside the danwei system (Tu 2019: 65) . Since the 1980s, with the gradual dissolution of the danwei system, the health care burden was further shifted from the state to individuals. At the same time, health care activities became increasingly linked with consumption activities. The marketization of the health care system slowly gave rise to a new self-caring subjectivity that had to learn to negotiate in the market economy. As a result, individuals are faced with increasing uncertainties over medical charges and are encouraged to become 'calculative' (Tu 2019: 68f) . The goal for the neoliberal self-responsible subjects is to consume the right products, which \"has increasingly become a technique of self-management.\" (Tu 2019: 72) One must be careful that the health care responsibility is not shifted to an independent self with a clear boundary from the other, but rather an \"interdependent self-defined by one's social role and relationships\" (Hwang 1998: 21f) . Callahan (2006: 14) noticed \"interesting parallels between Confucianism and the pastoral politics of governmentality\": A neo-Confucianist understanding of governance \"transgresses the binary distinctions of state and civil society to make individuals, civil society and state conterminous and mutually entailing.\" According to Daxue (The Great Learning), one of the Four Books of the Neo-Confucian orthodoxy, self-cultivation is rarely a self-indulgent and narcissistic practice but rather a departure point for the proper order of family and state. In this sense, there is a striking similarity between the Confucian self-cultivation and the Foucauldian 'care of the self' (Hahm 2001) .",

            "text": "Confucian ethics such as xiushen played a central role in 'appealing' citizens towards self-cultivating subjects, which constitute the cornerstone of the often taken-for-granted 'mask culture' in China. Mask-wearing can be seen not only as an act of self-cultivation but also as the Foucauldian 'care of the self' that involves \"knowing and fulfilling one's duties toward others, including one's spouse, children \u2026 and fellow citizens.\" (White 2014: 498) . In the Chinese context, the paradigmatic process of individualization and liberalization since the 1980s, to put it schematically, did not give rise to subjects who perceive the facemask as limiting their freedom, but rather those who perceive it as an embodiment of care. During the SARS outbreak, facemasks embodied the 'right' health product and a 'rational' choice in the health care market, especially when no medical cure for the SARS disease was available. People purchased facemasks, scrambled for them, hoarded them, and at the same time, facemasks were given as personal gifts or as the 'care' of the company (Lynteris 2013: 175 ). Facemasks involve not only self-care but also care for others. It is a kind of coterminous understanding of the care that care of the self, care for family members, civic duty (care for the state), and vice versa, being cared for by the state, and being cared for by the family are mutually entailing. Although Foucault's 'care of the self' is primarily based on his examination of historical texts from ancient Greece and the later Hellenistic/Roman period, this concept can be useful for conceptualizing mask-wearing in that it points to an ethical question of relation to oneself and relation to others, and of the entanglement of the two.",

            "text": "SARS can be understood epidemiologically as a viral epidemic that tested Hong Kong's healthcare system but also symbolically as an epidemic of fear testing the city's moral existence (Baehr 2008) . Even though SARS in Hong Kong ended up with a death toll of 'only' 299 people, this knowledge was not available at its outbreak (Baehr 2008: 139) . SARS brought about mass insecurity and panic in Hong Kong, with its sudden appearance, its unique pathogen for which no standard medical cure was available, and its puzzling mechanism of transmission. To make things worse, in Hong Kong, officials were reluctant to use the term SARS, choosing instead to call it 'atypical pneumonia' (Peckham 2016b: 284f) . In both the Chinese and English language media, martial terminology and disease-as-war imagery were pervasive (Baehr 2005: 148) . The medical staff was described as 'frontline' workers or as 'troops' fighting against the virus. Other words such as 'battleground', 'hero', or 'sacrifice' were also suddenly ubiquitously used by media and citizens. Meanwhile, the withholding and censoring of information during SARS by the central government in Beijing led to a massive distrust of official information, which further aggravated misinformation about the disease and the infectious circulation of panic (Rojas 2015: 160f) . It is against this backdrop of drastic mental experience of panic, massive public emotional charge, and collective disempowerment, that Baehr (2008: 150) observed that Hong Kong has suddenly turned into a 'masked city': mask-wearing became the quickly improvised, if obligatory, social ritual; failing to don one was met with righteous indignation, a clear sign of ritual violation. The mask symbolized a rule of conduct -namely, an obligation to protect the wider community -and an expectation regarding how one was to be treated by others. More simply, the mask was the emblematic means by which people communicated their responsibilities to the social group of which they were members.",

The first moment of emergence concerns the birth of modern facemasks, whose design and form remained almost unchanged till today. They were more than medical masks. The rationalities of implementing them intermingled with strategical socio-political concerns of late-Qing reformers at the crossroad of historical transformation. Around 90 years later, in another epidemic event 2002/3, a new facemask regime emerged, whose subjects themselves are willing to wear masks and give meaning to this act. The economy of facemasks has come to play a dominant role. The proliferation of disposable and inexpensive surgical masks paved the way for the sudden appearance of a universal masking strategy during the SARS epidemic. The mask economy not only helped a liberal government to shift health care responsibility to the public but also gave rise to an ethical problem. Mask wearing became a sign of care, yet in some cases, it became a risk ritual in order to protect the wider community. The so-called community mask can be seen as a product of liberal biopolitics of masking strategy.",
