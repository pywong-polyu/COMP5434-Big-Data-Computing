Individuals with higher levels of mental health literacy recognize mental health problems and symptoms, know where to seek help and information, and understand that the mental health problems can and should be treated. Mental health literacy is associated with behavioral health care utilization (Mendenhall and Frauenholtz, 2013) and propensity to seek behavioral health services (Smith & Shochet, 2011) . Unfortunately, mental health literacy in the general US public is low (Dunn et al., 2009) , and most individuals struggle to identify mental health disorders and are uncertain how to obtain information and treatment if they encounter difficulties (Jorm et al., 2006) . In particular, individuals have a particularly difficult time identifying problematic symptoms of anxiety (Coles & Coleman, 2010) and depression (Dunn et al., 2009) . Limited information is available regarding the state of mental health literacy today. This may be due, in part, to internalized stigma about mental illness and the associated lack of awareness.",

There are a wide variety of health insurance plans, and all cover different things at different amounts. The health insurance system is complex and is often difficult for consumers to navigate (Consumers Union, 2012) . Insurance coverage for behavioral health services plays a role in treatment initiation and completion, given the substantial cost of treatment. Having personal health insurance that provides coverage for behavioral health often leads to higher rates of treatment seeking (Alegr\u00eda et al. 2012; Lundgren et al., 2005; Pinedo, 2019) . Data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health, an annual, nationally representative, cross-sectional survey, indicates that not only are many individuals un-or under-insured, but many are unaware of, or do not understand, provisions for behavioral health treatment under their plan (Cummings et al., 2014) . Given that a part of mental health literacy includes beliefs about the treatability and appropriate course of treatment for mental health concerns, it is likely that there may be some relationship between poor mental health literacy and poor insurance literacy. No study known to the authors has addressed this potential overlap.",

In addition, results of various studies indicate that few African Americans, Latinx Americans, and Asian Americans have sought mental health treatment (Jackson et al., 2007; Le Meyer et al., 2009; Villatoro et al., 2014) . What is less well known is how MHL impacts rates of help seeking across group. Few studies have addressed demographic differences in MHL, including those along racial/ ethnic or gender lines. In one study, Vermaas et al. (2017) found no differences in mental health literacy rates among clergy of various denominations, including historically Black protestant groups. Some research (Hee Yun Lee et al., 2020; Leighton, 2010) found evidence that there are gender differences in MHL, with women having more social support for and awareness of mental health disorders than do men. This dearth of research related to demographic differences in MHL has led to some researchers (Jorm et al., 2006) to call for additional research on the potential variations in MHL and how those differences might impact behavioral health service utilization.",

For example, depression rates among a national probability sample in the USA tripled compared to rates measured pre-pandemic (Ettman et al., 2020) . A great deal of research indicates low rates of mental health service utilization relative to need among trauma survivors experiencing mental health symptoms (Sayer et al., 2009; Vogt et al., 2011) .

Taken together, the barrier to behavioral health intervention coupled with perpetuation of stigma serves to compound barriers to treatment, reducing the likelihood that individuals in need would seek and engage in mental health treatment. In a longitudinal, population study (Bonabi et al., 2016) , researchers found that low mental health literacy and negative attitudes toward mental health care were associated with lower levels of behavioral health engagement, even when controlling for sociodemographic characteristics. In their metasynthesis of the extant literature on caregivers' mental health literacy, Hurley and colleagues (Hurley et al., 2019) found that poor mental health literacy was a substantial barrier to behavioral health treatment seeking and was associated with financial and knowledge barriers, fear and mistrust of treatment services, and mental health stigma. Given important group differences in trauma-related mental health experiences that highlight the role of social determinants of health and wellbeing (e.g., gender or social role), it is crucial to have a robust appreciation for the factors contributing to treatment access and utilization during an enduring crisis like COVID-19.",

High scores on the measure are representative of lower mental health literacy, so scores suggest that Black and Asian respondents had the least mental health literacy.

Results suggest that mental health literacy is poor, and individuals are not readily able to identify mental health symptoms and appropriate courses of treatment. Furthermore, mental health literacy is associated with key variables in the expected ways, specifically, that individuals who report poor mental health literacy also report higher rates of depression, anxiety, stress, and internalized stigma. These results indicate troubling low rates of mental health literacy with steep associations noted among internalized stigma and health insurance literacy; however, individual mental health symptoms (e.g., depression) reported by this sample during the COVID-19 pandemic were low compared to other reports from 2020 (Ettman et al. 2020) . This discrepancy may be explained by measurement differences, or assessment at different time points. The Ettman et al. (2020) data were collected using the PHQ9 from March to April 2020, compared to the current study, which assessed depression symptoms using the MDI a number of months later, in December 2020. There is evidence that the PHQ9 is an adequate screening instrument but a poor diagnostic tool for measuring symptom severity on its own (Levis et al., 2019; Wittkampf et al., 2009 ). The MDI, however, is useful both as a reliable measure of depression symptomology but as a screening tool for depression severity (Olsen et al., 2003) . Additionally, assessing mental health symptoms in the context of COVID-19 in the first few weeks of the pandemic is considerably different from doing so at the end of the calendar year, by which point the Federal government had articulated the first coordinated response to the virus, including a systematic plan to disseminate vaccines that had not been developed the previous Spring. The results indicating extremely poor mental health literacy are not surprising as mental health literacy includes ratings of one's ability to recognize the symptoms of mental health difficulties. A sample of responses that includes more variability in mental health literacy, in particular, may evidence different patterns of associations with symptoms reports, as individuals with better mental health literacy may be better able to recognize features of their mental experiences differently. Findings from the present study point to the importance of intervention, especially during disasters when stress is high. Poor mental health literacy is especially problematic when large swathes of the population are struggling with mental health concerns, including depression and anxiety (BLINDED). The public faces the daunting challenge of making sense of the tremendous volume of COVID-19 information available across a wide range of information platforms as they learn about the virus while facing the reality of unprecedented uncertainty (Abel & McQueen, 2020) . This is undoubtedly challenging, and mental health literacy may impact the facility with which individuals can take in critical health information.",

Larger samples with more diversity in response are required to ensure adequate power for multiple group testing. Furthermore, additional inquiries into the link between social determinants of health and mental health literacy are necessary. More samples are needed, perhaps using GIS indicators of location to better align features of disparity by place rather than solely relying on individual characteristics reported by the respondents. Finally, the present study was cross-sectional in nature, and there are several limitations of the methodology used. Cross-sectional designs, while useful for exploratory research such as this, are limited in their ability to determine direction of association, or causal elements. More direct assessment of association is warranted, and future researchers may wish to consider utilizing a MHL intervention to begin the work of remedying poor MHL and assessing the outcomes of that approach.",
