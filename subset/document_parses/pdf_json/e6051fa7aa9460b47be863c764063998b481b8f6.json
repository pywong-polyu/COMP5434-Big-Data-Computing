The concept of dual career refers to the combination of an athletic career with education and/or occupation (Geraniosova and Ronkainen, 2015) . Educational models that promote the dual career are based on the human right to education and guarantee that elite athletes can train and compete and at the same time develop their academic career (S\u00e1nchez-Pato et al., 2017) . For an athlete, pursuing education while competing in high-performance sport can be a challenging task. The increasing demands on athletic performance in elite sports place high pressure on athletes, who may feel forced to choose between maximizing their athletic potential or obtaining a satisfying education for a post-athletic career (Lavallee and Wylleman, 2000) . As stated by Geraniosova and Ronkainen (2015) , this situation may lead to premature discontinuation of the athletic career due to prioritization of education (Amara et al., 2004) or, by contrast, to lower investment in education due to exclusive focus on achieving athletic success (Aries et al., 2004) .",

The student-athlete is the leading role in this scenario where sport is the main life axis and an athletic identity based on success determines a personality that represents the values and is the source of affective and interpersonal relationships (Lally and Kerr, 2005) . This identity must be preserved and, at the same time, developed in such a manner that the athlete accepts, with responsibility, the student role that will allow them to broaden their personal knowledge and to work on their own future through the acquisition of specific skills (Migliorati et al., 2016) . Some universities facilitate this process through the creation of a key role to ensure dual-career efficiency: the sport tutor. From this perspective, it seems necessary to offer a personalized tutorship model using a clear pedagogic approach in which sport must be always connected to comprehensive education. Thus, there must be a very close relationship between sport and continuous learning, based on mutual acknowledgment (Isidori, 2016) . In this regard, the sport tutor plays the role of an academic guide, encouraging the achievement of good academic results, and of a mediator among student-athletes, the university, and the sport organizations. Furthermore, they plan the training and studying schedules and monitor and support the academic career through e-learning and other online support tools, especially during competition periods when the student-athlete cannot attend university (Isidori, 2016) .",

Under normal conditions, student-athletes make an effort to perform both activities simultaneously, organizing and optimizing their time with the help of their tutor. In an extraordinary situation like the one arising during the COVID-19 pandemic, studentathletes stopped attending their training centers and needed to adapt to home training with very limited resources and facilities (Toresdahl and Asif, 2020) . All sport events and onsite training were postponed or canceled, leading to economic loss (Jim\u00e9nez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2020) . In line with this, the report created by the Association for Spanish Sport (Asociaci\u00f3n del Deporte Espa\u00f1ol, ADESP) together with Active Spain Federation (Fundaci\u00f3n Espa\u00f1a Activa) and the High Council for Sport (CSD) has yielded very relevant results as regards the impact that the health crisis has had on the Spanish sport system. The estimated loss for 2020 is 4.6 billion Euro, meaning 38.5% of the revenue expected by the participating organizations in 2020. According to this report, COVID-19 has also caused a decrease of 31% in athletes' income. The unemployment rate within the sector has raised by the same percentage (Jim\u00e9nez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2020) . Besides this uncertainty, on March 24, 2020, the International Olympic Committee announced that Tokyo Olympic Games (OG) would be postponed 1 year, until summer 2021, because of the pandemic (International Olympic Committe, 2020). This unprecedented decision left elite athletes in a standby situation as regards the training plan followed during the previous 4 years. These athletes resumed training individually, after a 7-week lockdown, on Monday, May 4 (beginning of lockdown ease in stages), when basic training was allowed again as well for professional leagues and high-level athletes (Agencia Estatal Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado, 2020a).",

Up to date, no study has been found to address this topic. Therefore, the aim of the present research was to assess elite student-athletes' perception of the dual career during the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with a group of elite student-athletes who could develop their dual career under normal conditions, both in pre-Olympic years.",

The instrument was composed of 84 items, with various question types (Likert scale, multiple choice, short answer). Most questionnaire items used a Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (\"strongly disagree\") to 5 (\"strongly agree\"). This assessment tool was divided into two categories: (a) sociodemographic and context variables (14 items) and (b) dual-career aspects (70 items). The items about dual career comprised three subscales: \"academic career\" (38 items), \"sport career\" (15 items), and \"sport tutor\" (11 items). In addition, it included some questions about the dual career (six items). The results revealed high internal consistency of the questionnaire, since Cronbach's alpha coefficients were higher than 0.70 in the three dimensions: academic career (alpha = 0.81), sport career (alpha = 0.73), and sport tutor (alpha = 0.93), which are above the lower limit accepted as reliable (Corbetta, 2007; S\u00e1nchez-Pato et al., 2016) .",

After assessing variable normality through the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, homogeneity through Levene's test, and sphericity through the Mauchly test, a descriptive analysis was conducted for the quantitative (means and standard deviations) and qualitative variables (counts and percentages). The differences between the two groups (COVID-19 and control groups) in the continuous variables were determined using unpaired t-tests. The effect size was calculated, defined as low (r = 0.10), moderate (r = 0.30), high (r = 0.50), or very high (r = 0.70) (Cohen, 1988) . Chi-square analyses were used to analyze differences between groups in the categorical variables. Cramer's V was used for post hoc comparison of 2 \u00d7 2 tables and the contingency coefficient was used for 2 \u00d7 n tables, obtaining the value of the statistic and the p-value. The maximum expected value was 0.707; r < 0.3 indicated low association, r between 0.3 and 0.5 indicated moderate association, and r > 0.5 meant high association. The statistical analysis was performed using the statistical package SPSS 21.0 for Windows. An error of p \u2264 0.05 was established. Table 1 contains the results of the descriptive variables for both groups. No statistically significant differences were found between groups (p > 0.05). The COVID-19 group was found to spend a significantly higher number of hours per week studying, with a moderate effect (p = 0.03), while no significant differences were observed between groups in the number of training sessions or training hours per week (p > 0.05). Table 2 shows the athletes' perceptions and opinions about the dual career. The COVID-19 group showed better perception of whether their sport career could help them cope with their academic career (p = 0.03) and better general perception of remote learning (p < 0.001). No significant differences were detected in the perception of interference of studies with athletic performance or vice versa, or in the perception of the sport career-academic career balance (p > 0.05). All participants perceived certain interferences between both spheres and admitted that it was not easy to achieve good balance.",

            "text": "The aim of the present research was to assess elite studentathletes' perception of the dual career during the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, compared with a group of elite student-athletes who could develop their dual career under normal conditions, both in pre-Olympic years. It was noteworthy that the student-athletes from the COVID-19 group spent a higher number of hours studying than those from the control group, composed of elite athletes in a normal pre-Olympic year. There was no difference in the number of training sessions or training hours per week between groups, maybe because during the lockdown period caused by COVID-19, the training sessions were performed at home with the aim to keep a physical conditioning routine (Andreato et al., 2020) . Previous studies have pointed out that the major barrier Olympic athletes encounter to complete a university degree is time management, since they need to spend over 40 h a week on duties derived from studies and sport (Subijana et al., 2015) . This barrier becomes even greater if athletes compete at the international level (Fuchs et al., 2016) , like in the present study. One factor that affects the balance between the time spent on training and studying is directly related to the distance from the student-athlete's home to the training venue or university (Condello et al., 2019) . The lockdown has allowed for increased time availability, since these transfers were not needed anymore. This has allowed studentathletes to increase studying hours, without negatively affecting the number of training hours. From the above, it can be hypothesized that, under normal circumstances, switching to online university studies might increase success in the dual career and this is a key aspect to consider when planning dualcareer programs in the future. It would allow athletes to better manage their agenda and to reduce their transfer time, thus solving one of the major and most stressful issues for them, which is lesson attendance, especially during competition periods (Gavala-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2019) . Nonetheless, the significant increase in studying hours has not led to student-athletes' identity reconfiguration, since they still perceive themselves more as athletes than as students. This result is in keeping with previous studies (S\u00e1nchez-Pato et al., 2017; Gavala-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2019) . This could be due to the fact that the study sample was fully composed of internationallevel elite athletes, which could reinforce their identity as athletes (Lupo et al., 2015) . Another relevant finding was the increase in the perceived benefits of the sport career on the academic career for COVID-19 athletes, compared with a group of Olympic athletes in a normal pre-Olympic year. It is important to highlight that the majority of them obtained university scholarships, thanks to their status of elite athletes. According to previous studies, these athletes are aware of this fact, which could partially compensate the reduced time spent with family and friends, due to the high demands in order to perform well in both sport and academic fields (Gavala-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2019) . The change observed in this item in the COVID-19 group could be due to the fact that elite athletes have become aware during the lockdown that university studies are a means and not a barrier to develop their life projects, and as a consequence, a greater adherence and perceived importance from athletes of dual-career programs may be expected after the COVID-19 pandemic. In this regard, a student-athlete's priorities are highly determined by the circumstances of their ecosystem (Aquilina, 2009) . In contrast to the normative concept of enrolling at university because of social pressure, studentathletes of the COVID-19 group self-realized the importance of holding a university degree for their future after retirement from sport (Jordana et al., 2017; Gavala-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2019) and that this is a possibility they can only access thanks to their status of elite student-athletes (Debois et al., 2015) . In fact, previous studies have stated that motivated athletes are able to combine their academic and sport careers in an optimal manner (Lupo et al., 2015) , both dimensions being equally relevant within their identity (O'Neill et al., 2013) . Nevertheless, motivations may differ depending on the support structures available to athletes during their dual career (Kerstajn et al., 2018) , making further research needed on this topic.",

Furthermore, there were different opinions about whether the academic career interferes with sport performance. It was much more obvious for student-athletes that sport performance interfered with their academic performance. Both groups presented the same trend in these variables despite the fact that the COVID-19 group dedicated longer time to their academic development. A possible explanation to this would be related to the influence of external factors on studentathletes' dual career Kerstajn et al., 2018) . Previous studies have revealed that the coach's role acquires key relevance during student-athletes' adulthood, being the external factor with the greatest influence on their decisionmaking and priority setting (Wylleman and Lavallee, 2004) . Actually, coaches are usually reluctant to their athletes spending time on studies, in spite of the official rhetoric (Ronkainen et al., 2018) . The absence of the coach during the lockdown may have modified their capacity of influencing these factors. Based on this, interventions with coaches would be needed so that they become a positive influence on elite student-athletes' dual career. This is an important topic to be considered in future research.",

Nevertheless, in general, athletes of the COVID-19 group did not encounter any additional barriers that could hinder success in their dual career, apart from the traditional ones (Subijana et al., 2015) . This could be because these athletes were already enrolled on a longterm dual-career program, whose development is guaranteed by the university and the Spanish Olympic Committee. This program has kept running with the required adaptations (Conferencia General de Poli\u00ectica Universitaria, 2020), i.e., faceto-face lessons were suspended and teaching and evaluation was adapted to remote or online mode (Odriozola-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2020) . Furthermore, as the Spanish government decided that universities would autonomously manage their official degrees and master's programs (Conferencia General de Poli\u00ectica Universitaria, 2020), the university where the participants came from decided to teach the 100% of hours of the face-to-face degrees and master's virtually, while the online studies continue in the same way, with the sole adaptation to the evaluation to online mode (Universidad Cato\u00eclica San Antonio, 2020) . This suggests that the existence of formal support structures is an irreplaceable aspect in the dual career, especially in exceptional situations, and they are expected to be a more successful strategy than the laissez-faire/non-formal models applied in other contexts (Aquilina and Henry, 2019) . In fact, student-athletes showed positive perception of some of the characteristics that are inherent to a formal dual-career program, such as the flexible curriculum, sport monitoring of the dual career by the university, the role of the sport tutor, and the services provided by the sport tutor (Isidori, 2016; S\u00e1nchez-Pato et al., 2017) . Previous studies have already detected that the lack of these features hinders success in the dual career (Fuchs et al., 2016; Gavala-Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2019) . According to these findings, it should be proposed that future dual-career programs be based on formal structures and established protocols that help to successfully develop the two areas that converge in the dual career.",

Another aspect that could have influenced this perception is the evolution that online learning resources have experienced in the last few years (Wieman and Gilbert, 2014; Camus et al., 2016) . This probably led to a better perception of the learning tools most commonly used by students in online learning (S\u00e1nchez-Pato et al., 2017) .

Previous studies have already suggested that students enrolled on online learning programs may better appreciate those tools that are directly related to achievement goal orientation, like the former ones (Dumford and Miller, 2018) . Another possible explanation is that during the lockdown caused by COVID-19, the use of the necessary tools in order to turn face-to-face learning into online learning has increased at university (Chaka, 2020) , making students who have a positive perception of these resources to use them more. In this line, online tasks were the virtual campus tool that allowed students to submit essays, reports, and similar projects. Through this tool, lecturers can evaluate the assignments and give feedback. During the COVID-19 pandemic, it has been the official way to submit all the works (Universidad Cato\u00eclica San Antonio, 2020), which may explain that students have used it more times as a learning tool. Meanwhile, videoconferencing was the tool provided by the university that allowed students to attend 100% of the theoretical and practical lessons during the lockdown. While students from online modalities used it before the COVID-19 pandemic, students from face-to-face learning had never used it (Universidad Cato\u00eclica San Antonio, 2020), which can explain differences between groups. On the other hand, fora is a tool that aims to create a space of discussion between lecturers and students on a specific topic. This tool was not used in face-to-face studies, while it is optional in virtual ones (Universidad Cato\u00eclica San Antonio, 2020), which can explain why the majority of both groups have never used it. Chats helped students to establish contact between them (Universidad Cato\u00eclica San Antonio, 2020); however, according to the present findings, its use was marginal. This could be a consequence of the students' preference for the use of smartphones for communication in university environments (Gasaymeh, 2017) . In line with the latter, there is not much use of Twitter and Facebook in the current high education context, although previous studies have reported that a pedagogical use of this kind of tools can increase the students' motivation, learning climate, and academic achievement (Calder\u00f3n et al., 2019) . Further dual-career programs may include this kind of tools in learnings in order to analyze differences in studentathletes' perception.",

Thus, a lower percentage of COVID-19 athletes intended to continue with their athletic career after completing their studies. This could be due to a change in the student-athletes' life project. Under normal circumstances, they would have relied more on sport as their main professional activity, but now, in a scenario full of uncertainty, they see their income decrease (Jim\u00e9nez-Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2020) and, consequently, go for their university career as an instrumental means for life.

The Spanish Sport Law (Jefatura del Estado, 1990 ) established that only the first and second divisions of the Spanish soccer league and the first division of the Spanish basketball and handball leagues are professional leagues. As a consequence, clubs involve in these competitions act as companies and their players are considered as workers at all levels (salaries, legal rights and duties, etc.) (Mart\u00ednez-Lemos, 2015) . On the contrary, Spanish athletes have difficulty to devote themselves professionally to sport out of these modalities, which is one of the main perceived barriers in order to achieve success in dual career (Subijana et al., 2015) . In this line, a high percentage of the student-athletes of the current study were doing some kind of remunerated work in addition to being athletes and students (34.7-38.5%), supporting that athletes' autoperception is influenced by the fact of being able to live autonomously from sport (North and Lavallee, 2004; Subijana et al., 2015) .

Another limitation was that the current study did not analyze the differences in the student-athletes' perception of the dual career with a longitudinal design, but with a transversal design involving student-athletes in both pre-Olympic years, one during the lockdown caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and another one under normal conditions. Future studies need to analyze if the changes in the Spanish studentathletes' perception of the dual career as a consequence of the COVID-19 still remain once the pandemic ends and they can return to their normal lives.",
