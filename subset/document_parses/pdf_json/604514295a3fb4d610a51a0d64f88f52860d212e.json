Vaccine-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenia (VITT) is characterized by thrombocytopenia and thrombosis in association with anti-platelet factor 4 (PF4) antibodies. Herein, we propose five potential anionic substances of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine that can combine with PF4 and trigger VITT, including (1) the proteins on the surface of adenovirus, e.g., negative charged glycoprotein, (2) the adjuvant components of the vaccine, e.g., Tween 80, (3) the DNA of adenovirus, (4) the S protein antigen expressed by the vaccine, and (5) the negatively charged impurity proteins expressed by the vaccine, e.g., adenovirus skeleton proteins. After analysis of each case, we consider the most possible trigger to be the negatively charged impurity proteins expressed by the vaccine. Then, we display the possible extravascular route and intravascular route of the formation of PF4 autoantibodies triggered by the negatively charged impurity proteins, which is accordant with the clinical situation. Accordingly, the susceptible individuals of VITT after ChAdOx1-S vaccination may be people who express negatively charged impurity proteins and reach a certain high titer.",

VITT was more frequent in young people, therefore, the health authorities of several European countries and Canada modified their immunization strategies, reserving the ChAdOx1-S vaccine for older people (4) . The United States also reported similar events related to the Ad26.COV2-S Janssen vaccine, leading to a pause in its roll-out (4, 5) .

Greinacher et al. reported that people receiving ChAdOx1-S had one or more thrombotic complications beginning 5 to 16 days after vaccination (9) . So far, most of the reported cases became symptomatic within 30 days of the first dose of the ChAdOx1-S vaccine, and VITT was more frequent in women and patients aged < 55 years (5, 9) . VITT patients often showed laboratory signs of disseminated intravascular coagulation with severe thrombocytopenia (9) , and most thrombotic complications occurred at unusual sites, particularly cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVT). On the basis of such a situation, healthcare authorities advised vaccine recipients who suffered symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest, abdominal, or extremities pain, severe headache, dizziness, visual disturbances, or other neurologic symptoms within 30 days of ChAdOx1-S vaccination should be urgently investigated for VITT by associated laboratory tests (10, 11) .",

            "text": "For substance 4, in COVID-19 patients, anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG-spike glycoprotein immune complexes can activate platelets through FcgRIIa. Kadkhoda et al. (13) figured out that adenoviral vectors leak into the circulation, travel to distant sites, and infect permissive cells. Once infected, copious amounts of soluble spike glycoproteins lead to a relatively high level of SARS-CoV-2 spike \"antigenemia\". In a person with a prior SARS-CoV-2 infection and/or with cross-reactive antibodies to common coronaviruses (CoVs), a high enough titer of aberrantly glycosylated antibodies would be induced. But if a person is pre-infected with SARS-CoV-2 and there are SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, the vaccine would be ineffective rather than the cause for VITT. As for the crossreactive antibodies, there are no direct references supporting its relation to VITT. Greinacher et al. (15) found that antibodies tested against PF4 induced by vaccination do not cross-react with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which indicates that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein may not be a trigger of VITT. From another perspective, the above four anionic substances are common in other adenovirus-based vaccines, for example, the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine, if they are plausible, which means that the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine would cause the same incidence and severity of VITT as the ChAdOx1-S vaccine, but that is apparently not the situation (18) . Or at least for the ChAdOx1-S vaccine, the above four anionic substances cannot cover all substances that may bind to PF4, triggering VITT.",

Besides, McGonagle et al. (12) also pointed out that a role for adenoviral proteins has been suggested as a potential factor in VITT in susceptible individuals. Susceptible individuals may be people who express the negatively charged impurity proteinsadenovirus skeleton protein-and reach a certain high titer. Just as the viral RNA can innate immune-driven immunothrombosis in severe COVID-19 pneumonia, the negatively charged proteins in these adenovirus skeleton proteins may play the same role as viral RNA and form adenovirus skeleton protein-PF4 complexes (12) , with this adjuvanticity likely contributing to autoantibody development and ultimately thrombosis in VITT.",
