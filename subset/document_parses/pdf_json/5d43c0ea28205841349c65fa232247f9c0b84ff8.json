Characterization techniques, for example, FTIR, SEM, XRD, and tensile strength analysis were performed to analyze the composite nanofibers. Molecular docking calculations were performed to evaluate the binding affinity of PVDF and ZnO@ PVDF against the hexon protein of adenovirus (PDB ID: 6CGV). The cytotoxicity of tested materials was evaluated using MTT assay, and nontoxic doses subjected to antiviral evaluation against human adenovirus type-5 as a human respiratory model were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction assay. IC 50 values were obtained at concentrations of 0, 2, and 5% of ZnO-loaded PVDF; however, no cytotoxic effect was detected for the nanofibers. In 5% ZnO-loaded PVDF nanofibers, both the viral entry and its replication were inhibited in both the adsorption and virucidal antiviral mechanisms, making it a potent antiviral filter/mask. Therefore, ZnO-loaded PVDF nanofiber is a potentially prototyped filter embedded in a commercial face mask for use as an antiviral mask with a pronounced potential to reduce the spreading of infectious respiratory diseases, for example, COVID-19 and its analogues.",

            "text": "Preventing the spread of the novel coronavirus (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2), publicly known as COVID-19, became a worldwide demand to overcome the current global crisis with its several mutations such as Omicron and allow people to get back to their normal lives. The origin of coronavirus family is known as Coronaviridae, which also includes genus Torovirus. These two genera share a very similar structure. 1 SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus that has a surface spike layer (20 nm). 2, 3 The devastating strain of SARS-CoV-2 was reported first in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 and notified as a world pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) in March 2020. 4 It was reported that the pandemic resulted in around 5.5 million deaths resulting from more than 308 million global infections till 2022 5 (https://www. worldometers.info/coronavirus/, 2022.01.10). The infection transmits through inhalations via droplets and aerosols when infected people sneeze or cough; breeze; or by being in contact with infected surfaces. 6 The fine virus particles remain infectious for at least 16 h, and their inhaled aerosols infect the cells of the upper and lower respiratory tracks. 6 Subsequently, WHO suggested wearing surgical masks for human protection and to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2 as well as other respiratory infectious diseases. 7 Recent studies show that facial protection via filtering face pieces and masks may reduce the spread of viruses such as influenza and Corona viruses by 85%. 6 During the current pandemic, and generally during epidemics, there is a noticeable shortage in personal protective equipment, especially with the expectation of new upcoming infections' waves and/or virus mutations. There is always extensive use of masks, gloves, protective suits, face shields, gowns, and N95-grade masks by healthcare workers and general public, which represents the frontline in reducing the infection risk. 8 Therefore, viral disinfection and reuse of personal protective materials might allow their reutilization. Examples of disinfection methods are heat, 9, 10 ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, 11, 12 steam, 13 ozone, 14 vaporized hydrogen peroxide, 15 chemical disinfectants, 12 and autoclaving. 16 Different organic compounds and metal oxides exhibit antibacterial and antimicrobial activities. 17 Organic biocides such as triclosan, biguanides, chlorohexidine, and quaternary ammonium compounds were used in nanofiber fabrication to enhance the antimicrobial activity. 7 In addition, a wide variety of metal/metal oxides of titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), and silver (Ag) have been examined in soluble and insoluble forms due to their small sizes and high surface area. They can inactivate the viral particles through interfering with the surface antigen and blocking their attachment to the host cell receptors, 5 while the ions of Ti and Zn are adsorbed on the bacterial cell surface to inhibit its protein activity. Human protective materials have been developed in parallel to vaccine production. 18\u221220 It is important to fabricate biocidal masks that are safe upon disposal without causing secondary infections. Therefore, focusing on the selection of biodegradable, breathable, and virucidal materials enables superior protection against SARS-CoV-2 and bacteria, and extending the application to other types of PPE materials like body protection gowns and textiles for hospital uses thus increases their benefits. Also, application of antiviral agents to fabricate masks is a strategic technology to overcome the transmission of SARS-Cov-2 and such innovative idea depends on used materials. 21, 22 Various mask technologies and advanced materials are examined to overcome the critical mask shortages, crossinfection, and secondary transmission risk. Enormous efforts have been directed to improve the mask performance by incorporating new functionalities, such as using metal nanoparticles and herbal extracts to inactivate pathogens, graphene to make masks photothermal and superhydrophobic, and triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) to extend the mask lifetime. 23 Recently, the immobilization of Ag NPs on cotton fabrics of about 2\u22124 nm and 10 nm was studied, and the cotton fabric was observed to exhibit antiviral activity against influenza A and feline calicivirus. 24 Highly durable, antibacterial, and UV protective cotton fabrics were developed by the in situ synthesis of ZnO-NPs using hexamethyltriethylene tetramine (HMTETA) without the support of capping or other stabilizing agents. 25 The nanofibers were designed with a side-by-side structure of ZnO-NPs on one side and Ag-NPs on the other side, thereby forming a coupled fiber with the properties of photocatalysis, excellent antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and enhanced filtration efficiency. 26 The highly pathogenic H5N1 and the low pathogenic H5N3 viruses were inactivated on Cu\u2212zeolite-coated textiles, even after short incubation, due to the presence of Cu 2+ ions, as compared to the zeolite-coated textiles. 27 CuO-NP-embedded nanofibers were fabricated with a hydrophobic polymer\u2212polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) using electrospinning, and CuO nanoparticles were exposed from the PVP polymer surface by etching the nanofiber with oxygen plasma and tested against H1N1 virus using quantified realtime polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The antiviral efficacy of CuO nanoparticle-incorporated nanofibers and results revealed that 70% of viruses were inactivated after 4 h of contact. 28 Here, the antiviral activity was tested against human adenovirus type-5 (ADV-5), which, in its structure, mimics respiratory viruses as it just needs the traditional facilities of BSL2. Adenoviruses are double-stranded DNA viruses having a genome around \u223c36 kb long. 29 They are always associated with a wide range of human diseases, including respiratory tract infections and ocular and gastrointestinal tract disorders, predominantly affecting children and young adults. 30 Recently, nanofibers are being intensively and significantly employed in several applications due to their ease of preparation, enhanced surface area, and the possibility to host some other materials like nanoparticles. One of these potential applications include antiviral materials and antiviral masks. 31 Nanofibers can be lab-manufactured via phase separation (sol\u2212gel), chemical vapor deposition, conjugate spinning, self-assembly, melt blowing, and electrospinning. 32 Electrospinning forms 3D nanofibers that are characterized by a wide variety of pore diameter distribution, high porosity, and effective mechanical properties, which allow it to reach the industrial stage. 33 Moreover, they have excellent thermal/ mechanical properties, while their chemical resistance can be improved by loading with different materials such as Ag, CuO, Al 2 O 3 , TiO 2 , and ZnO, with the ability to use spinnable biodegradable polymers such as PVDF and PAN, which might help in reducing the global waste disposal problem. 7, 34 Furthermore, the in-situ growth of nanoparticles on PPE surfaces may lead to leaching at some point of usage, which may cause serious health problems or discomfort for end-users; the binder may also affect their properties; so, this problem was fixed via electrospinning technology that affords increasing the polymeric surface area and enhancing the stability of impeded nanomaterials on the nanofiber structure. 35\u221238 For the interpretation of material interactions, molecular docking is among the most widely used molecular modeling methods. It is mainly used to model the binding sites and interactions within protein\u2212protein or protein\u2212ligand complexes at the atomistic level 1. In docking calculations, two steps are employed: sampling of different poses and the assessment of the binding affinity between molecular structures. There are many available packages that perform well in predicting the binding affinity of small molecules to the protein structure. AutoDock Vina is one of the most used docking packages in protein\u2212ligand interactions 2. 39\u221241 In this work, the pristine nanofiber of PVDF which has \"no\" antiviral activity against respiratory viral infections, such as adenovirus, has been successfully converted into potent antiviral material via introducing a low-cost metal oxide (ZnO-NPs) in its nanofiber matrix. For overcoming the current Coronavirus pandemic and infectious diseases, the antiviral material-loaded electrospun nanofibers were fabricated and demonstrated applications in potent personal protective tools, such as face masks, filters, and hospital gowns. Instead of the current commercially used polypropylene face masks, the implementation of commercial face masks such as N95 with degradable antiviral nanofiber filters (2 \u00d7 2 cm 2 ), or the antiviral nanofiber itself as a face mask internal layer, shall aid in overcoming the current pandemic due to the high filtration ability and comfortability. ZnO-NPs at different concentrations of 0, 2, and 5% loaded electrospun PVDF NFs were successfully fabricated by electrospinning, with diameters of 194, 164, and 83 nm, respectively. In the cost-effective onelayer form with enhanced mechanical properties, the electrospinning conditions, it optimized and intensively characterized to ensure their successful preparation and encapsulation efficiency. The cytotoxicity of PVDF and ZnO-NPs loaded PVDF NFs in 2 and 5% was examined by MTT assay, and the antiviral activity of nanofibers was evaluated using quantitative real-time PCR assay.",

The microstructures of both blank PVDF nanofibers and ZnO-loaded PVDF composite nanofibers were investigated from the SEM images displayed in Figure 1 . The obtained nanofiber structure was imbedded with ZnO-NPs that play an important role in antiviral activities, as will be described in Section 3.7. An optimum beads-free nanofibrous structure was shown in the case of pure PVDF NFs, while through the addition of ZnO-NPs, the polymeric chain arrangement and crystallography structure might change; these change the electrospinning conditions, resulting in an increase in the encapsulation ratio with an increase in the concentration of ZnO-NPs and decrease in the nanofiber diameter (average of 30 measurements) for PVDF, 2% ZnO/PVDF, and 5% ZnO/ PVDF of 194, 164, and 83 nm, respectively. The mixing of ZnO-NPs with the PVDF solution before using the electrospun technique allows the ZnO-NPs to be imbedded and stabilized with the nanofiber interior structure. As ZnO is a semiconductor particle that decreases the dielectric constant of the polymeric solution, it results in the instability of the whip and charge density in the Taylor cone, leading to an increase in the nanofiber diameter and formation of more encapsulated structures under the same condition of electrospinning of pure PVDF. It is noticeable that ZnO-NPs enable the reduction of the critical voltage for electrospinning from 23 to 18 kV. 47 Also, it has to be stated that increasing the solution conductivity to carry more charge results in the formation of thinner nanofibers, and the fibrous diameter reported to be decreased due to the enhanced conductivity of the ZnO/ PVDF composite and formation of thinner nanofibers. Therefore the encapsulation of ZnO-NPs has appeared obviously with increasing its content with respect to the fixed percentage of PVDF. The content of ZnO was evaluated through EDX analysis, and the PVDF content evaluated with respect to the wt % of F element is almost stable (65 \u00b1 3 wt %, F). Using PVDF as the carrier for ZnO-NPs, the presence of ZnO in the nanofiber structure also indicates the loading of Zn element in 2% ZnO/PVDF and 5% ZnO/PVDF NFs by 1.14 wt % Zn and 2.2 wt % Zn, respectively. The increasing ZnO content might be implemented on the tubular structure of the nanofibers as well as its outer surface; hence, the antiviral effect is shown with respect to the used loading percentages.",

The XRD patterns of ZnO-NPs and the normalized chart of PVDF NFs, 2% ZnO/PVDF NFs, and 5% ZnO/PVDF NFs are presented in Figure 2a . The standards card number of ZnO NPs is 01-078-2585; the patterns at 2\u03b8 = 18.5\u00b0and 20.2\u00b0were attributed to PVDF crystallites, and the \u03b1 phase is predominantly PVDF crystalline, with three most distinctive diffraction patterns at 2\u03b8 = 18.5\u00b0, 20.2\u00b0, and 26.6\u00b0. 48 Furthermore, the broad pattern in the case of PVDF is due to the formation of a layered structure after the electrospinning process. This layered structure led to the shift of the pattern positions in a broad form; 49 Figure 2b shows the FTIR spectra of ZnO-NPs and ZnOloaded PVDF composite nanofibers. The asymmetric and symmetric vibrations of the C\u2212H bond of PVDF appeared at \u03bd 3022 and 2978 cm \u22121 , respectively. The absorption peaks at \u03bd 1398 and 1176 cm \u22121 were attributed to the C\u2212F and CF 2 stretching peaks, respectively.

However, such mechanism still remains unclear. Interestingly, it is suggested that the antiviral effect of ZnO-NPs is due to the oxidative stress induced in response to Zn oxide causing a damage to viral DNA, thus preventing viral replication. 58 (iii) Zn 2+ ions inhibit the viral entry, local replication, and spread to cells during the viral pathogenesis process, which has been previously described for the antiviral activity against HSV. Also, the nanostructure affinities toward different surface viral receptors might prevent the viral entry into the cells. 54, 58 Another proposed mechanism is the transient elevation of Zn 2+ concentration that facilitates its complexation with the adhesion molecules on the cell surface, preventing the binding of the virus and its entry, as previously proposed for the antiviral activity against rhinoviruses. 59 (iv) ZnO micro\u2212 nanostructures exert an inhibitory effect on HSV-1 due to their direct interaction with the viral particles, trapping the virions, and subsequently, blocking the HSV entry into their target cells. A similar mechanism can be suggested for our used model ADV-5 via the virucidal mechanism, after incubating the virus with our materials for 1 h before infecting the Vero cells. 60 (v) Another study also showed that ZnO-NPs significantly increased the transcriptional levels of peroxidases (POD) that increase the plant defense mechanism against Tobacco mosaic viruses, providing another possible explanation. 61",
