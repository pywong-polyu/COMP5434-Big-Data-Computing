We did not restrict our search by language. Of twenty published articles identified in PubMed, we found one case study describing disease presentation associated with Delta variant infection in a child. Another study examining the increase in hospitalization rates of paediatric cases in USA from August 1, 2020 to August 27, 2021 stated that \"It is not known whether the B.1.617.2 (Delta) variant [...] causes different clinical outcomes in children and adolescents compared with variants that circulated earlier.\" Four studies reported cases of transmission of the Delta variant in school and community contexts; and two discussed screening testing in school-aged children (thus not directly relevant to the research question here). Remaining papers did not target paediatric age specifically. We found no studies investigating differences in COVID-19 presentation (e.g., duration, burden, individual symptoms) in school-aged children either in the UK or world-wide.",

Median illness duration was short with either variant (overall cohort: 5 days (IQR 2-9.75) with Alpha, 5 days (IQR 2-9) with Delta). The seven most prevalent symptoms were common to both variants. Symptom burden over the first 28 days was slightly greater with Delta compared with Alpha infection (in younger children, 3 (IQR 2-5) with Alpha, 4 (IQR 2-7) with Delta; in older children 5 (IQR 3-8) with Alpha and 6 (IQR 3-9) with Delta infection in older children). The odds of several symptoms were higher with Delta than Alpha infection, including headache and fever.

The Alpha variant (B.1.1.7) initially emerged in the UK in September 2020 (https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/), and was the predominant UK strain from November 2020 until early May 2021 (https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attach ment_data/file/959438/Technical_Briefing_VOC_SH_NJL2_SH2.pdf; https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attach ment_data/file/1014926/Technical_Briefing_22_21_09_02.pdf). The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) was initially identified in India in October 2020, with the Delta lineage designated a \"variant of concern\" by WHO on May 11, 2021 (https://www.who.int/en/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants/). By the end of May 2021, the Delta variant was the predominant (>75%) circulating variant in the UK, reaching >99% in the week commencing on June 27, 2021 (Supplementary Table 1 : https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attach ment_data/file/1018547/Technical_Briefing_23_21_09_16.pdf). The Delta variant appears more transmissible than wild-type or other emergent variants to date, with transmissibility approximately 60% higher than the Alpha variant. 7, 8 There is some evidence that COVID-19 due to infection with the Delta variant may be more severe than previous strains, with increased requirements for hospitalization and respiratory support; 9,10 and currently available vaccines may be modestly less efficacious against infection with the Delta variant than preceding variants, although still very effective against severe illness and death. 11 In adults, comparisons of COVID-19 caused by the Delta variant vs. other variants is particularly complicated by vaccination roll-out and altered clinical presentation in individuals infected post-vaccination. 12 However, children in the UK were not offered vaccination until after Delta became the main circulating variant. At-risk minors (i.e., with severe neuro-disabilities, Down's syndrome, immunosuppression, multiple or severe learning disabilities) aged \u226512 years, and those co-living with immunosuppressed individuals, were offered vaccination after July 19, 2021; a single dose was offered to children aged 16-17 years after August 4, 2021 and to children aged \u226512 years after September 13, 2021 (date of announcement; https://www.gov.uk/government/news/jcvi-issues-advice-on-covid-19-vaccination-ofchildren-and-young-people). is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

Several individual symptoms were more common with Delta infection (particularly in older children), and symptom burden appeared slightly greater, in both age groups. However, most symptoms were of short duration (median, <2 days); overall illness duration was short (median, 5 days); few children required hospital attention; and illness lasting for more than 28 days was uncommon. Our data suggest that clinical characteristics of COVID-19 due to the Delta variant in children are broadly similar to COVID-19 due to other variants. 13 For both variants, the symptom with longest duration was 'blisters', although this symptom was rare. Five types of cutaneous lesions have been identified with COVID-19 17 of which pseudo-chilblains, mainly reported in children, are at the lowest spectrum of severity; these resolve spontaneously, albeit slowly, in most cases. As children were not clinically examined, nor photos submitted, we are not able to comment further on the nature of these lesions.",

Whilst cohort studies have included some comparisons between variants in the adult-and child-populations considered jointly, child-specific data have not been reported separately. 9 The latest report from the USA Centers for Disease Control indicates that differences in disease severity and duration between Delta and previous variants in children are unclear (https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7036e1.htm?s_cid=mm7036e1_w). However, although USA cases in children have increased recently, the proportion of hospitalised children requiring intensive care is unchanged, suggesting infection severity is at least no worse (and possibly less) with evolution of circulating variants. 18 In England 9 and Scotland, 19 observational data from the population as a whole (no child-specific aggregation) suggest hospitalization may be higher with Delta compared to Alpha infection (noting that vaccination has changed the profile of illness in adults, and currently the majority of hospitalized adults in the UK are unvaccinated). In contrast, data from Norway (again, children not analysed separately) did not support higher rates of hospitalisation with the Delta variant. 20 With the exception of odds ratios for symptom presence, which could be robustly tested, our data are descriptive. We included data from all regularly proxy-logged children with a positive test during the two timeframes, noting the many differences between the two groups that could not be controlled for. As for many children worldwide, the pandemic has been extremely disruptive for UK schooling. Lockdown was re-imposed across the UK just before Christmas 2020; and primary and secondary schools were closed throughout January and February 2021. Schools reopened from March 8 until the end of the school year (nominally, end of July) (https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/covid-19-response-spring-2021). However, school attendance continued to be compromised on an ad hoc and intermittent basis for many children (for example, at-home quarantining whilst awaiting a test result, whether for the child personally, a family member, or classmates). Differences in school attendance may have affected our data in multiple ways, including differing daily routines (e.g., linking school attendance with proxyreporting habits), exposure to SARS-CoV-2 at school and on public transport, and testing of children according to parental decisions regarding school attendance.",

Few proxy-reported children presented to hospital, and the numbers of children with illness >28 days were low. Our study adds quantitative information around manifestation of infection due to the Delta variant in children, which will contribute to the ongoing debate regarding the role of vaccination in children, particularly for younger children. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",
