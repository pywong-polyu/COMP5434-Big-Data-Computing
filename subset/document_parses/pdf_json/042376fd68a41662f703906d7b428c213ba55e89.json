Many governments issued stay-at-home (or shelter-in-Place) orders to contain the spread of the coronavirus, asking people to self-quarantine until they had the disease under control [14, 21] . The sudden changes in daily life had an impact on the electricity industry around the world, and many countries have observed significant changes in electricity consumption patterns [11] . Researchers in [1, 7, 17] have attempted to record and review the impact of COVID-19 on the electricity industry, but there was a research gap on load forecasting during COVID-19. It is not well understood how the load forecast performs during an emergency event like the COVID-19 pandemic and how to improve the performance of load forecasting. We are thus motivated to bridge the research gap by systematically evaluating models and features that can be used to improve load forecasting amid COVID- 19 .",

Amid COVID-19, a study in Ontario, Canada revealed that the overall electricity demand has declined by 14% in April 2020 [1] , Spain displayed a decreased power demand of 13.49% due to the lockdown measures [17] , while in the US, overall electricity generation declined after the issue of stay-at-home advisories [7] . The limit on mobility adds further complexity to electricity consumption behaviors. Under the full lockdown scenario, increased residential consumption and decreased industrial electricity consumption were observed in a lot of places in the world, such as Lagos, Nigeria [6] , Kragujevac, Serbia [5] , China [4] , and New York, US [2] . The study on the residential electricity consumption in Kragujevac, Serbia also identified an increase in consumption for heating and electrical devices brought about by the increased presence of residents in their households [5] . Despite having such volatile load demand profiles during the pandemic, only a few studies were conducted on improving load forecasting accuracy. Among them was a study by Chen et al. [3] , according to which mobility data forms a useful feature for load forecasting during COVID-19, which will be examined in this paper as well.",

In Figure 2 , the daily forecasting MAPEs also fluctuate drastically for all three models, reaching high peaks > 10% around day 40 to 60, suggesting volatile performance forecasting unusual data. Among all the evaluated models, ARIMA is unable to produce meaningful results as the resultant accuracy is much lower than that of the other three models. Thus we will not consider ARIMA in the actual analysis.
