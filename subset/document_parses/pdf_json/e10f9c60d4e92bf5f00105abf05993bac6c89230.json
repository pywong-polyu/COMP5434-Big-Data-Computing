            "text": "In the early 2000s, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) defined designer drugs as \"novel chemical substances with psychoactive properties,\" synthetized based on chemical structures of well-known drugs of abuse, and clandestinely manufactured with the intention to mimic the effects of controlled substance and circumvent regulation [1] . Later, UNODC coined the new term \"new psychoactive substances\" (NPS) to designate \"substances of abuse, either in a pure form or a preparation, that are not controlled by the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs or the 1971 Convention on Psychotropic Substances, but which may pose a public health threat\" (UNODC, www.unodc.org). NPS are a broad range of drugs belonging to different chemical classes able to elicit stimulant, entactogen, hallucinogen, depressant, and cannabis-like effects with higher potency compared to the original compounds [2, 3] . Around 830 NPS were monitored by the EMCDDA in 2020, and 46 of them were first identified in 2020 [4] . Roughly, 500 NPS are found on the national MAP/ERK cascade [43] . Recently, Cocchi et al. (2020) reported that the phenethylamines 2C-H, 2C-I, 2C-B, and 25B-NBOMe are genotoxic in the human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells [44] . Additionally, the effects of cathinones and phenethylamines have been studied in vivo by using animal models [24, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . Moreover, high-resolution methods have been developed to detect these classes of NPS in different kinds of biological specimens (e.g., urine, hair, and plasma) [50, 51] .",

On the other hand, the in vivo preclinical models mentioned here are very expensive, and time-and resource-consuming, and their outcome is slow compared to the appearance of the NPS in the drug market. For these reasons, a valid in vitro toxicological method in human cells would represent an effective strategy of quick screening that has not been reported yet. Human SH-SY5Y cells are frequently used in vitro to model both undifferentiated and differentiated neuronal cells [52] . These cells express dopaminergic markers, such as DAT and tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH), and, if stimulated with several agents, show a mature neuron-like phenotype characterized by fusiform shape, extensive outgrowth of neurites, and increased expressions of TH and neuronal markers (i.e., neuron-specific enolase, synaptophysin, and synaptic-associated protein-97) [53] [54] [55] [56] . This cell line is thus a useful research tool to reveal the underlying toxicity mechanisms of several drugs of abuse that have neurotoxic effects mediated by the dopaminergic system.",

            "text": "3,4-MDPHP and 2-Cl-4,5-MDMA are considered emerging NPS of interest. 3,4-MDPHP is an analog of 3,4-MDPV that differs only by the addition of a single carbon to the alkyl chain ( Figure 1 ). Its synthesis was initially reported in the 1960s [57, 58] . 3,4-MDPHP was notified to the EMCDDA by Sweden in 2014. 3,4-MDPHP is a potent monoamine transporters inhibitor [59] [60] [61] . Acute intoxication is characterized by tachycardia, hypertension, various cardiovascular effects, as well as agitation, hallucinations, and paranoia [59] . A case of fetal death associated with the use of 3,4-MDPHP has been reported [62] . Gas and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry are mainly used for the identification of synthetic cathinones, including 3,4-MDPHP, in seized and forensic case samples [63] , as well as biological specimens (blood, urine, hair, oral fluid, and tissue) [64] . 2-Cl-4,5-MDMA, also called 6-Cl-MDMA, is an amphetamine derivative of MDMA with high toxicity by ingestion, inhalation, and contact [65] . This phenethylamine was first identified, by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and NMR, in a batch of seized MDMA (\"ecstasy\") tablets [66] . It was later classified as a psychostimulant and euphoric. The structure of 2-Cl-4,5-MDMA was clarified in a study in 2005 where the goal was to identify an unknown compound that had been detected by thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in the urine of a drug addict; later, the compound was isolated by TLC and then analyzed by GC-MS [65] . Based on the data provided, the compound differs from MDMA only for the addition of a chlorine atom (see Figure 1 ); for this reason, it has been considered a possible synthetic impurity [67] . The legal status of 3,4-MDPHP and 2-Cl-4,5-MDMA is still ambiguous, but their main congeners are scheduled in several countries (e.g., UK, USA, Italy, Germany, China, and Canada).",

This differentiated cell line displays a mature neuron-like phenotype and develops a dopaminergic phenotype, expressing high levels of several dopaminergic markers (i.e., TH, D2, and D3 receptors), thus representing a useful tool to investigate the in vitro neurotoxicity of NPS acting on the dopaminergic system such as synthetic cathinones and phenethylamines [71] . In these cells, we demonstrated that 24 h of treatment with either 3,4-MDPHP, 2-Cl-4,5-MDMA, or fentanyl produced a strong and concentration-dependent inhibition of cell viability, in line with previous studies showing a decreased cell viability following exposure with different cathinones [38] . Specifically, in the dopaminergic-differentiated SH-SY5Y exposed to 3,4-MDPHP, the toxic effects start at 125 and 250 \u00b5M (about 16% and 23% reduction in cell viability, respectively) and reach the peak (i.e., 72% decrease in viability vs. control values) at the highest concentration tested (1000 \u00b5M). It should be noted that first-generation pyrovalerones (e.g., pyrovalerone, 3,4-MDPV, and 2,3-MDPV) produced only a slight decrease in mitochondrial activity in the examined cell lines, including differentiated SH-SY5Y [72] . Specifically, 24 h of exposure of the banned analog 3,4-MDPV (300 \u00b5M) elicits only a modest MTT reduction in SH-SY5Y, although it was active at lower concentrations compared with their reference compound methamphetamine. Additionally, most studies reported that cellular cytotoxicity induced by cathinones is observed only after an incubation time longer than 24 h and with concentrations >1 mM [37, 39, 40, 72] . The sensitivities for inhibition of cell viability might vary according to the different cell lines used, time of exposure, and substituent in synthetic cathinones examined.",

While high concentrations of synthetic opioids, such as tramadol and tapentadol, caused an increase in toxicity as assessed by MTT assays in the SH-SY5Y cell line [73] , no data were available on fentanyl cellular toxicity. Few papers evaluated the cytotoxicity of fentanyl in different cell lines (i.e., human pancreatic cancer cell line, SW1990; human breast carcinoma cell line, MCF-7; microglial cell line, BV-2) and reported cell viability inhibition compared to the control group [74] [75] [76] . The mitochondrial dysfunction observed following exposure with all the tested compounds did not induce an increase in LDH release, indicating that it was not associated with a loss in membrane integrity. Indeed, the decrease in mitochondrial function often anticipates membrane damage; consequentially, the LDH leakage measurement may be less sensitive compared to the MTT reduction assay [77] . In line with our results, Wojcieszak et al. (2016) showed that MDPV did not trigger LDH leakage in undifferentiated SH-SY5Y cells at concentrations that already exhibited a significant decrease in MTT reduction [72] .",

            "text": "Increasing evidence indicate that oxidative stress plays an essential role in the cytotoxic effects of several drugs of abuse (e.g., amphetamines and cathinones) inducing the formation of highly reactive species [78, 79] . In vitro studies have shown cytotoxic effects of all cathinone derivatives in several cell lines, reporting increased ROS/RNS production, and/or the depletion of reduced glutathione, as well as increased oxidized glutathione levels [38] . The cytotoxicity of 3,4-MDPV, a progenitor of \u03b1-pyrrolidinophenones and an analog of 3,4-MDPHP, has been reported in neuronal and hepatic cell lines, along with their mechanisms of toxicity, which are the disruption of mitochondrial function, and the oxidative stress (generation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species, depletion of reduced glutathione). Regarding the phenethylamines, a recent study showed the ability of some of these compounds (i.e, 2C-H, 2C-I, 2C-B, and 25B-NBOMe) to induce an ROS increase in the human lymphoblastoid TK6 cells 1 h after treatment, while MDMA failed in increasing ROS levels [44] . Accordingly, Valente and collaborators showed that MDMA can increase ROS levels in a primary rat hepatocytes cell line [40] but not in undifferentiated and differentiated human SH-SY5Y cells [41] . Our findings demonstrated that, in line with studies showing an ROS increase in dopaminergic-differentiated SH-SY5Y cells, 3,4-MDPHP and 2-Cl-4,5 MDMA increase ROS levels to a similar extent, while a stronger production of ROS is observed after exposure to the highest concentration of fentanyl. Currently, due to a lack of information in the literature, it is not possible to compare our data concerning increases in fentanyl-induced cytotoxicity and ROS levels. Following the oxidative damage, mitochondria may go through profound changes, including outer membrane permeabilization and subsequent translocation of the pro-apoptotic factor Bax. This factor leads to the release of cytochrome C that promotes the activation of caspases, which, in turn, manage apoptosis through the cleavage of numerous proteins, leading to the engulfment of the dying cells [80] . Apoptosis is a genetically encoded programmed cell death, while necrosis is typically not associated with activation of caspases and is thought to mediate cell death in response to damage or a pathology [81] . The present data reveal that our compounds provoke cell death through different mechanisms, both apoptosis and necrosis, with 2-Cl-4,5-MDMA mainly activating the apoptotic process, 3,4-MDPHP mainly by necrosis, and fentanyl inducing both mechanisms. Specifically, 2-Cl-4,5-MDMA and fentanyl treatment induce early apoptosis features (i.e., stained only with annexin V-FITC) in a high number of cells, while cells treated with 3,4-MDPHP showed necrosis features (i.e., stained with propidium).",

In line with these results, apoptotic and necrotic phenomena were previously described following abuse of piperazines [82] , mephedrone [83] , and related cathinones [84] . The treatment with fentanyl induces a high number of either annexin V-FITC and/or PI-stained cells, and increased levels of Bax and caspase 3 activity, supporting a double mechanism of cell death. It should be noted that the concentrations of drugs used in our in vitro study are higher than those found in urine or blood of drug abusers [85] [86] [87] ; however, our data are consistent with several studies reporting in vitro cytotoxic effects (i.e., reduced viability at concentrations >1-2 mM) after exposure to several drugs of abuse, including cathinones, amphetamine-like stimulants, phenethylamines, and synthetic cannabinoids [41, [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] . It should also be considered that, due to their high lipophilicity, fentanyl and cathinone derivatives possess a high volume of distribution, reaching significantly greater concentrations in lipophilic tissues, such as the central nervous system [93] , and consequently, their blood concentrations might not directly reflect their organ/tissue levels. Moreover, there is a lag time between drug intake and blood samples collection, and that may result in lower concentrations being identified due to metabolic processes and the antemortem/postmortem redistribution of the lipid-soluble compounds.",

Indeed, while 2-Cl-4,5-MDMA activates apoptotic processes, 3,4-MDPHP causes cell death mainly by necrosis. Fentanyl instead was able to induce both mechanisms displaying higher potency. Furthermore, this series of in vitro tests might serve as a quick and efficient way to screen new compounds to have useful information about their neurotoxicity, and to direct further in silico and in vivo studies for a full pharmacological and toxicological characterization.",
