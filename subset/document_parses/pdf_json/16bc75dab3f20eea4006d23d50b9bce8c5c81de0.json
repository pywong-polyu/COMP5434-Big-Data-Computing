The dynamics of cytokines are highly complex and little is known about specific interactions. Researchers at the Ontario Veterinary College have encountered cytokine storms during virotherapy. Multiple mouse trials were conducted where a virus was injected into mice whose leukocytes lacked expression of the type I interferon receptor. In each case a rapid, fatal cytokine storm occurred. A nonlinear differential equation model of the recorded cytokine amounts was produced to obtain some information on their mutual interactions. Results provide insight into the complex mechanism that drives the storm and possible ways to prevent such immune responses.",

Cytokines are released by cells to coordinate an immune response to help protect against foreign and/or dangerous matter. They are produced in response to infection and inflammation [5] . There are five major classifications of cytokines; interferons (IFN), interleukins (IL), chemokines, colony-stimulating factors (CSF), and tumour necrosis factors (TNF) [23] . Together they function in order to stimulate a response that will control cellular stress as well as minimize the amount of damage to a particular cell or group of cells [5] .",

For reasons unknown, positive feedback loops can become up-regulated during an immune response involving complex interaction between cytokines and immune cells. The fine balance that is typical of healthy individuals is lost and gives rise to a cascade which is termed a cytokine storm. The dynamics of cytokines during normal immune responses and even more so during storms are highly complex and little is known about specific interactions [5, 27] . Cytokine storms not only have very negative effects on the immune response, they often have life threatening effects including a decrease in blood pressure, increase in heart rate and can often lead to death of the host [27] .",

To keep the model relatively simple, we ignore the effects of effector cells (activated immune cells) due to the complexities it brings to the model. To date, the only model that is of a similar nature is produced by [27] called Dynamics of a Cytokine Storm. In this paper, the interactions of nine cytokines were modelled using data from a human clinical trial where six volunteers took part in a study that accidentally led them to undergo the effects of a cytokine storm [27] . This model was primarily constructed to look at the effects of the antibody responsible for the cytokine storm using a linear ODE model where parameter estimation determined coupling parameters between cytokines. The coupling parameters identified which cytokine was responsible for enhancing or inhibiting each other cytokine as well as self-regulation [27] .",

Following administration of a highly attenuated virus to mice with leukocytes lacking the type I IFN receptor, a deadly cytokine storm developed leading to death in only 24 h. Down-regulation of anti-viral IFN signaling is a common mechanism used by viruses during infection, including those associated with cytokine storms (e.g. influenza virus [14] , SARS-coronavirus [3] and Ebola virus [2] ). Thus, a natural question arises: what are the specific dynamics of cytokines with respect to both initiating and exacerbating a cytokine storm when type I interferon signalling is impaired?",

Chimeric mice were made by lethal irradiation of the bone marrow of C57BL/6 mice (Charles River Laboratories) followed by reconstitution with bone marrow from either wild-type or type I IFN receptor (IFNAR)-knockout donors (the latter provided by Laurel Lenz, University of Colorado School of Medicine). These mouse-based experiments were approved by the institutional Animal Care Committee and complied with the standard of the Canadian Council of Animal Care. These mice were infected intravenously with recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus with a deletion of methionine at position 51 of the matrix protein (VSV m51) [21] . The matrix protein of VSV suppresses antiviral type I IFN responses. Therefore, this mutant virus renders the already attenuated laboratory strain of VSV even safer and it is being developed as an oncolytic virus for the treatment of cancers via intravenous infusion [24] . Surprisingly, mice lacking the IFNAR on their leukocytes experienced a profound cytokine storm, ultimately leading to death in only 24 h. The resulting time series data provided concentrations of 13 different cytokines in plasma, measured using a multiplex array (BioRad). Concentrations of 13 cytokines were recorded at times 0, 2.5, 5, 10 and 24 h for both the wild-type mice and mice lacking the IFNAR on 20% of their leukocytes. Raw data was then normalized to account for the vast variability in the concentrations. This was done by dividing the concentration at each time point by the sum of the concentrations across all time points for a particular cytokine. In order to produce an accurate fit to the model it was essential to group cytokines to reduce the number of parameters. Grouping was based on the inflammatory classification of each cytokine as well as similarity of cytokine profile. The time at which the peak concentration occurred was recorded along with either the pro-or anti-inflammatory classification. Groupings can be seen in Table 1 . Parameter estimation techniques, specifically fmincon in MATLAB, were used to fit the model to the data. The cost function is the typical least squares function with a normalization matrix to offset discrepancies between groups.",

Of the three, TNF-\u02dbis assumed to be the dominating cytokine. TNF has been thoroughly studied and is one of the most well known cytokines as it plays an important role in the outcome of immune function [18, 23] . Model results for Group 2 show that it is an integral part of six significant interactions and has multiple two-way paths, one with Group 5 and another with Group 7. All three interactions that affect Group 2 are enhancing, indicating that as the storm progresses, the amount of cytokine will continue to rise. TNF-\u02db, along with IL-1\u02c7(found in Group 3), are considered early-response cytokines, occurring soon after an immune response is triggered. It is known biologically that TNF-p romotes the generation of IL-1\u02c7 [23] . Although the results are not shown for the wild-type case, the model results indicate that in fact Group 2 does enhance Group 3. In the case of IFNAR-knockout mice however, Group 2 inhibits Group 3 (the relatively small interaction is not shown in Fig. 2 ). This difference begins to shed light on why a storm occurred in mice lacking IFNAR on leukocytes.",

IL-10 is often produced once a cytokine storm has begun in an attempt to return the balance that has been lost, termed immunoparalysis. Although overproduction can often allow the host to survive the cytokine storm longer, it is not likely it will survive long term [8, 18, 23] . Model results for Group 4 show that there are six interactions that are significant as well as two primarily enhancing two-way interactions with Groups 3 and 5. The three interactions that affect Group 4 are all enhancing, meaning that the amount of Group 4 will likely increase as the storm continues. Biologically it is known that IL-10 plays a role in the down regulation of both TNF-\u02db(Group 2) and IL-1\u02c7(Group 3) [18] . Referring to Fig. 2 , the model verifies that in fact Group 4 does inhibit Group 2, however Group 4 enhances Group 3. This could be due to the grouping of cytokines, since Group 2 contains MIP-1\u02c7and IL-12 as well. On the contrary, in the wild-type case, Group 4 inhibits Group 3 while it enhances Group 2.",
