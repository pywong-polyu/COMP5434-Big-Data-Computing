Open spaces play a vital role in healing the natural environment as well as the physical and mental health of the citizens. This paper presents an exploratory eco-park design project in Helwan, Egypt. The project focuses on the opportunity of integrating marginalised natural environments, such as Wadis (dry streams), with the urban fabric through Eco-landscape design. The current work explores the complex environment, characterised by detailed multidisciplinary data, which requires multi-layer analysis. The discussion evaluates the tremendous effect of integrating the participatory qualitative method with other analytical and digital tools, such as modelling and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), to deduce scientific details and activities in the preliminary phases of zoning plans. This results in a constructive framework for merging these multi-methods and tools within the participatory eco-landscape design process. In addition, the conclusion highlights the peculiarity of the eco-landscape design and practice in the current Egyptian situation in a broad sense. Muller [6] argues that this shift starts by understanding that ecosystems can flourish in cities, if the way they are built is retrofitted. Thus, instead of doing a \"less harmful\" effect on the environment (similar to the sustainability approach), we should \"maximize the good\" [6]. This approach does not favour specific design aspects over another; rather, it tends to reveal as many layers of information as possible to develop the most efficient solutions.",

As declared by Stokman [12] , this perception would shift the profession from designing for privileged communities to solving urbanisation-related problems.",

Accordingly, eco-landscapes hold great potential in moderating urban poverty's environmental and social consequences in marginalised communities [13] . They are very beneficial in areas disconnected from central systems, or where the urban grid confronts noticeable topographical change, such as Wadis. However, producing properly designed interventions to benefit both urbanity and nature is a challenge due to inadequate knowledge of ecosystems' complexity. This lack of knowledge could be reduced by synthesising the \"small-space ecology\" scattered between fields [14] . This includes the site's physical characteristics like microclimate, hydrology, and soil type, along with ecologic characteristics like species distribution and plant types, where science-based solutions are produced instead of relying on designers' preferences.",

In Egypt, the pressing issue of water scarcity has gained increased attention because of the escalated water losses of the Nile surface evaporation, ineffective traditional irrigation methods, the increased water demand, and the construction of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. Furthermore, climate change, urban compactness, lack of green open spaces, financial limitations, and many other challenges raise the demand for more ecological methods to approach landscape design. Therefore, investigating and integrating new methods is necessary to be aligned with this environmental, economic, and social complexity, particularly when the diverse background, local knowledge, and landscape design practice fail to give a comprehensive understanding of local ecologies and their potential role as city infrastructures.",

Helwan was established in 1868 under the rule of Khedive Ismail as a therapeutic winter destination for Egypt's notables, depending on its famous sulfur springs. This therapeutic function started to decline with the establishment of the Tora and Helwan cement factories. During the Nasser era (1952 to the late 1960s), the government decided to transform Helwan into a centre for heavy and military-strategic industries. Since then, Helwan has become one of the most polluted areas in Cairo [16] . Exposure to airborne particulate matter generated from the cement industry continuously threatens people's health in Helwan, causing respiratory inflammation, chronic allergies, lung cancer and sleep disorders [17] . These problems elevate the necessity of restoring nature in Helwan. Thus, the researcher decided to focus efforts on improving a segment of Abu-Silly Wadi in Helwan [18] . This Wadi lies on the National Research Institute of Astronomy and Geophysics (NRIAG) property, as emphasised in (Fig. 1) , Helwan Wadis.",

The strategy of education and raising the scientific and environmental knowledge, for example, is not only achieved by the establishment of the park but is planned to be a continuous activity during the participatory design process.

We argue that although eco-park design is the landscape architect's crucial role, the engagement of other perspectives and multi-disciplines in the early design ideation process is also important but very challenging. Nassauer [4] declares that designing a single shared landscape usually engages groups with different backgrounds and languages, such as designers, scientists, technical experts, local stakeholders and policymakers. In such a practice, landscape functions are conceptualised as a boundary object that allows different groups to cooperate in \"back and forth\" iterative negotiations. This ideation process needs systematic and continuously evolving tools and strategies to be adopted according to the changeable situation. Multi-methods of data collection, analysis and formulating solutions can be used to enrich the eco-landscape design. This is important especially in developing countries, complex situations and the arising post-pandemic crisis. Such diverse forces and different backgrounds need comprehensive, collaborative multi-methods when dealing with the hybrid eco-landscape design process. This practice is hardly applied in Cairo, where the landscape work is usually the landscape architect's responsibility. Even though participatory involvement is rarely found in the early stages, as in the notable projects of the cultural park for children in Sayyida Zeinab and Al-Azhar Park.",

Constructed wetland and septic tanks are recommended as natural processes for grey and black water ecosystem treatment. Recycling construction waste and using earth material are proposed to the hardscape.

Hence, the importance of participatory action through a focus group workshop is to minimise the tension and reduce misunderstandings and biases between the different qualitative and quantitative teams to reach maximum coordination [23] .

The focus group discusses the possibility of catching the rain and proposes the eco-construction method, while the GIS analysis coordinates the previous merged layers and provides guidelines to locate the rain harvesting pond at the best point. Although it rarely rains in Egypt, the project looks to maximise the use of rain and search for several sources of irrigation besides the wastewater treatment, where every single drop of water counts. We argue that GIS tools play a significant role in comparing alternatives, helping designers in scientific-based decision-making and adapting the finalised design. Another example, constructing a telescope pier is one of the proposed observatory activities recommended by the NRIAGs astronomer. But checking the locations at the highest altitudes on the site and the best location of the telescope, checking the surrounding landmarks and adjusting the soft-scape is not easy to retrieve without the help of GIS.

We argue here that adding GIS can potentially adapt the preliminary design and keep both the scientific base and the participatory spirit. As a consequence, GIS involvement in detailed future scenarios is recommended. We argue that if the resultant framework and the workshop products are available sources, they will widely share data, limit the barriers, encourage the public to develop the process continuously and facilitate voluntary action and fundraising opportunities.",

The main shortcut path is designed to encourage walkability, and the paths' slopes are designed to suit disabled and older employees.

The distributed management guarantees an increase in productivity, manages separate flexible working hours, hires the talented local worker and closer to sites and reduces labours on-site, all that with fewer overheads are very beneficial in post-pandemic management. Maintenance risk is diminished by conducting a series of participatory workshops to build the capacities of the local workers.

Secondly, its position between NRIAG's historic buildings and the new campus offers a strong presence of experts who can play a significant role in community development, educate science and raise environmental awareness. Thirdly, the proposed eco-park framework can catalyse development at different pockets and sites in a city-wide short and long-term action plan through continuous research and ongoing prototypes on the ground. This prototype may distribute information about implementing the know-how of one or more of the work packages to the nearby sites. It may supply and exchange the used moulds and equipment, provide trained labourers and experts' technical advice, host the indigenous plants in its nursery and propose different themes and functions according to each site situation, potentials and needs. The shortage of information and the lack of practical experience are some of the challenging issues facing eco-design in developing countries. Funding is also one of the main problems facing eco-design projects, especially after the COVID-19 outbreak, which triggered a severe economic crisis that forced the government to cut the budgets of many services. Therefore, we argue that the research needs to involve more specialists such as ecologists to provide a more comprehensive understanding of local ecosystems' functions, flora and fauna and economists to assist in fundraising. We also recommend that psychologists emphasise and analyse the used language and promote communication skills between the diverse teams.",
