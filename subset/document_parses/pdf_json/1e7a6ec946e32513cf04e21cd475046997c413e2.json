We employ a generalized true random effects (GTRE) regression model that takes into account spatial correlation of costs among community colleges, to estimate cost efficiency via stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). The results reveal a positive relationship between operating costs and associate degrees and certificates as well both human (part-and full-time faculty) and financial resources (local, state and federal funding and tuition revenue), controlling for other variables. Furthermore, with an average persistent (long-term) efficiency of 87%, few institutions are relatively cost inefficient. Moving forward, campus leaders and policy makers alike may consider yearly data and efficiency calculations to develop strategic plans and funding alternatives. With 40 percent of first-time students transferring at least once within six years and over half of those students transfer from a community college, future research may study cost efficiency of community colleges while accounting for student transfers as an output.",

            "text": "In recent years, the economic climate of the United States has placed pressure on higher education policymakers and college campus leaders to become more cost efficient while increasing the production of baccalaureate degrees and certificates. At the same time, a similar effort has been made to focus on the community college sector as a point of access for students seeking post-secondary credentials. While community colleges were historically founded to help students complete their first two years of coursework, they have increasingly focused on vocational education, specifically on the completion of associate and certificate degrees (Cohen et al. 2014) . The focus on increasing post-secondary credentials resulted in a significant increase in the number of associate degrees and certificates awarded (Sykes, 2012; Miller et al. 2016) .",

For example, in a recent study, Bahr (2019) found positive returns for students completing certificates in California. Because of the private benefits of earning associate degrees/certificates, many states have begun to incentivize community colleges to increase their production via performance-based funding plans (McLendon & Hearn, 2013) . While there is some research on the effects of performance-based policies on community college degree production (Li & Kennedy, 2018) , not much is known about the institutional operating costs of degree and certificate production at public community colleges. Always a critical topic, this gap in the research has become even more concerning given the declining enrollment among community colleges due to COVID-19.",

First, we identify and examine the factors explaining public community colleges' operating costs over the 15-year period. Second, we utilize recently developed statistical techniques to quantify cost efficiency at the institution level. We are defining cost efficiency as the extent to which institutions are operating at or below institutions with the lowest costs when producing a given number of outputs (e.g., degrees, certificates) with a given set of inputs (e.g., students, faculty, staff, physical capital) and input prices. Third, we statistically separate persistent/long-term efficiency from transient/short-term efficiency and highlight the factors that affect them. Fourth, this research asks: how do financial resources influence both operating cost and persistent cost efficiency at public community colleges in the U.S., while taking into account spatial interdependencies?",

First, the few previous studies on costs at community colleges used either crosssectional data (Toutkoushian & Lee, 2018) or panel data for a short period of time (Sav, 2012) . Second, following Titus et al. (2017) and Vamosiu et al. (2018) , we account for geographic interdependence of operating costs and efficiency indices. By not accounting for the possibility of spatial correlation via a spatially weighted cost variable, previous studies implicitly assumed institutions across state borders or those located in rural versus metropolitan settings face similar operating costs.",

Fourth, we estimate how cost efficient each institution is both in the short-run (yearly basis) and over the long-run (the 14-year period). Separating efficiency by short-and long-term is essential for campus management and policy purposes. Specifically, it allows researchers to differentiate between singular management errors or incorrect responses to changes in market conditions and factor prices (e.g., faculty salaries) at one point in time (short run) and structural management problems and the misallocation of resources over the long-term. Therefore, this study provides campus leaders, researchers and policymakers with empirical analysis to inform discussions about the impact of funding on costs and cost efficiency at public community colleges.",

The latter supports Bowen's theory of costs in the arena of public community colleges. Moreover, a higher percentage of students under age 25 as well as a higher percentage of minority students are associated with higher operating costs. Public community colleges located in urban areas face higher operating costs. Focusing on relative cost efficiency, the study uncovers that few institutions are cost inefficient, whether one considers short/residual/transitory or long/persistent term efficiency. The average short-term efficiency is high, 90%, with even the lowest 10th percentile institutions reaching 85% efficiency. The average long-term efficiency is also high, 87%, with the most inefficient public community college still achieving 82% cost efficiency. Furthermore, persistent efficiency, which most often evaluates long-term management practices or structural problems of the institution, has only a small statistical relationship to financial resources (state and local funding, Pell grants, and tuition revenue).",

            "text": "Community colleges, originally called junior colleges, began in the early half of the 20th century (Drury, 2003) . While community colleges were originally envisioned as preparatory institutions for universities (Cohen et al. 2014) , community colleges today serve several different functions. They offer certificate and associate degree programs in vocational areas for students who wish to go directly into the workforce. Community colleges also offer transfer programs and coursework to prepare students for transfer into a baccalaureate degree. Community colleges also serve the community by offering non-credit classes for community members seeking to take classes for enjoyment or to enhance skills without earning a credential. Despite their multiple missions, community colleges have one thing in common: they are open-access institutions, so any student can enroll no matter their personal or academic background. Today, there are over 1050 community colleges across the country serving almost 45 percent of students in higher education (American Association of Community Colleges, 2020). Community college students are incredibly diverse-26 percent are Hispanic students, 13 percent are Black students, 6 percent are Asian American/Pacific Islander (American Association of Community Colleges, 2020). Almost 30 percent of community college students are first-generation students. The average community college student attends part-time (64 percent of community college students), maintains a job during school (72 percent of part-time students, 62 percent of full-time students), and is non-traditionally aged (average age: 28, median age: 24) (American Association of Community Colleges, 2020). The 6 year associate and certificate completion rate at public community colleges is 38.1% (National Student Clearinghouse Research Center, 2020) . Almost 70% of firsttime students enrolling in community college aim to eventually transfer and earn a bachelor's degree, but only 25% of students transfer and only 14% complete a bachelor's degree within six years (Horn & Skomsvold, 2011; Jenkins & Fink, 2016) .",

With respect to state level funding, Mullin and Honeyman (2007) indicated that there are three ways in which states fund community colleges. First, some states have \"no formula funding,\" which means colleges are not funded based on a common calculation. Second, some states use \"responsive funding\" which is adjusted by the operating cost of education or funding based on prior year changes in enrollment. Because they are open access institutions and enrollments can vary widely due to economic conditions (Romano & Palmer, 2016) , community colleges may be more susceptible to varying funding levels when employing enrollment funding formulas. Third, states using \"functional component funding\" justify their costs in terms of the components of operation within their institution.",

Performance-based funding (PBF) has been established as early as the 1980s where, in some states, a small proportion of funding was tied to performance measures (often called Performance-Based Funding 1.0). PBF became a much wider practice after 2009, when policies began to attach a larger proportion (or in some states, 100 percent) of funding to outcomes, or Performance-Based Funding 2.0 (Dougherty & Reddy, 2013; Li & Kennedy, 2018) . In the wake of the College Completion agenda, state lawmakers began to increasingly focus on the performance of higher education institutions, particularly the low completion rates at community colleges. As a result, 30 states today have introduced or implemented laws to provide community college funding at least in part based on performance measures, such as degree completion (Snyder & Fox, 2016) . PBF models at the community college focus on awarding funds based on a variety of metrics, including the completion of developmental coursework, passing college-level gateway courses, and completing a specific number of credit hours (Altstadt, 2012; McKinney & Hagedorn, 2017; Li & Kennedy, 2018) . More specific metrics include the completion of certificates and associate degrees (McKinney & Hagedorn, 2017; Li & Kennedy, 2018) . In fact, Li and Kennedy (2018) highlight that earned associate's degrees and certificates are the most frequently incentivized outcomes for PBF modes.",

The existence of local funding is highly correlated with the type of governance of community colleges by state. This is in stark contrast with four-year public higher education institutions, which generally receive public funding in the form of state and local appropriations in all states. In fact, one of the important ways in which community colleges differ from other institutions of higher education can be seen through their reliance on local and state funding and tuition and fees (Wellman, 2011) . State and local appropriations (if present) account for nearly 41% of community college funding, non-operating grants are 23% of revenue and tuition almost 16% (Dowd & Shieh, 2013) . Decreases in state and local funding, which at times has come when enrollment was at its highest, such as during the Great Recession (Romano & Palmer, 2016) , has often corresponded to increases in community college tuition. On average, tuition and fees at community colleges rose by nearly 40% from 2000 to 2015 (accounting for inflation) (National Center for Education Statistics, 2019). Despite this increase, public community college tuition is still far below tuition at public four-year institutions. In 2015-2016, the average cost for tuition, fees, and room/board was $9,939 for public community colleges compared to $19,189 at public four-year institutions and $39,529 at private four-year institutions (National Center for Education Statistics, 2019). Increasing tuition prices across all sectors of higher education can often result in more students enrolling in community colleges instead of four-year institutions (Hemelt & Marcotte, 2016) .",

In the context of higher education, the question is whether the cost is a worthy investment for a given outcome. Dowd and Shieh (2013) further articulate that productive/technical efficiency is defined as the cost of goods or services produced, while economic efficiency is a measure of whether the cost of producing goods brings desirable outcomes. They further clarify that \"economic efficiency cannot be obtained when socially undesirable outcomes are produced\" (p. 45). For the purposes of this paper, we are defining cost efficiency in relative terms: the extent to which institutions are operating at or below institutions with the lowest costs when producing a given number of outputs (e.g., degrees, certificates) with a given set of inputs (e.g., students, faculty, staff, physical capital) and input prices (e.g., salaries, physical capital rental rates, etc.).",

One study by Agasisti and Johnes (2015) explored both public and private universities using total expenses versus bachelor's degree production and found that these institutions tend to be relatively cost inefficient.

            "text": "One critical point made by Agasisti and Johnes (2015) is that cost efficiency studies must be disaggregated by type of institution (e.g., community colleges, regional colleges, research universities), as different sectors of higher education have different sets of inputs and outputs to consider. Few studies aim to understand operational costs at community colleges and address the issue of cost efficiency. Toutkoushian and Lee (2018) analyzed whether community colleges achieved economies of scale. Using cross-sectional Delta Cost Project data (2013), enrollment as an instructional output measure and total cost and expenditures as the input measure, the authors found evidence that community colleges did exhibit economies of scale. There are even fewer studies employing Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) to examine cost efficiency in the community college sector. Sav (2012) employed SFA to analyze whether cost and (in)efficiency differed between for-profit 2-year colleges and non-profit two-year colleges. Using IPEDS data from 2005 to 2009 fiscal years and teaching credit hours as output, Sav (2012) found that longer existing non-profit colleges (both public and private) were more cost efficient than newer for-profit colleges. Agasisti & Belfield (2017) also used IPEDS data examining a seven-year period and found little evidence of economics of scale-that cost appeared to be proportionate to output. They also found that colleges with higher proportions of minority students were less efficient and colleges with more traditionally-aged students were more efficient. The two studies analyzed a much shorter period of time than the current research and did not compute transient (short-term) cost efficiency versus persistent (long-term) cost efficiency, which are essential measures to consider in institutional and state level decision making (Filippini et al. 2018) . Romano and Djajalaksana (2011) analyzed spending at community colleges compared to other public colleges/universities to determine whether they were more cost efficient at educating students for the first two years compared to other public institutions. They used NCES and IPEDS data from 1987 to 2005 to look at trends in general expenditures, program costs and subsidies per student at two-versus four-year higher education institutions. They found a slight cost advantage to the public comprehensive institutions over the public community colleges but cautioned that it may be the result of vocational programs being more expensive to administer, compared to more introductory classes at four-year institutions.",

Baker and Levin (2017) argue that investigating cost efficiency in higher education requires consideration of geographic location. Toutkoushian and Lee (2018) similarly found cost differences among community colleges based on five geographic areas within the United States. The current study addresses geographic differences in costs by employing a spatial matrix containing the distance between an institution and its neighbors, with the relationship between costs at these institutions being less intense (inverse) with distance. Intuitively, institutions within the same small region may be faced with similar costs, but as we move outside of that region, costs become less similar. Furthermore, urban and rural institutions are compared when separating persistent cost efficiency from transient cost efficiency at public community colleges.",

            "text": "This study draws on the cost theory of the firm and Bowen's (1980) revenue theory of costs with respect to higher education institutions. The cost theory of the firm posits that the costs of production are related to outputs, inputs, input prices, and other exogenous factors. Graphically, the cost function is a boundary or an envelope that shows the lowest cost at which a given vector of outputs can be produced. Mathematically, a cost function describes a linear or non-linear relationship between the total costs of producing the desired level of output given the vector of inputs available. Baumol et al. (1982) seminal work extended cost theory to analyze firms that produce multiple outputs. Cohn et al. (1989) applied the theory to higher education institutions, which can be viewed as firms with multiple outputs: colleges and universities produce both teaching and research. Community colleges educate students at the undergraduate level, but produce little to no research (Sav, 2011 (Sav, 2012 Agasisti & Belfield 2017) . Although they engage almost exclusively in teaching, community colleges can also be viewed as \"firms\" that produce multiple outputs, particularly with respect to sub-baccalaureate degrees such as associate degrees and long, medium and short-term certificates. Bowen's (1980) theory of revenue and costs postulates that, because of their peculiar nature, higher education institutions spend all the revenue they receive. This revenue includes: federal, state and local appropriations; tuition and fees; profits from auxiliary enterprises (e.g., dining hall, bookstores, etc.); donations and gifts from businesses and individuals; and grants and contracts from the government (federal, state, and local) and private entities. The extent to which costs vary may depend on the amount of funds received from each of those revenue streams. Compared to the public funding of other types of public higher education institutions, public funding of community colleges is rather complex, as detailed in the previous section. Depending on the state, some public community colleges receive either local or state appropriations only for operating expenses or only for capital expenses (Center for Community College Policy and Education Commission of the States, 2000). Within Bowen's framework, the degree to which these sources of revenue have an impact on expenditures, costs and cost efficiency at public community colleges has yet to be explored.",

Intuitively, institutions within the same small region may be faced with similar costs, but outside of that region, costs become less similar. For example, community colleges employ faculty and staff within local market areas; therefore, it may stand to reason that labor costs for institutions on a small radius may be spatially dependent. Consequently, a spatially lagged cost variable can be calculated to account for differences in cost of living and market wages, where differences are more likely as the distance between community colleges increases. In other words, spatial analysis captures the reality that a change in an independent variable anywhere in the study domain affects costs not only in that domain, but in the surrounding areas as well, with decreasing intensity as the distance between institutions increases.",

Therefore, inverse distance squared (IDS) weights were created to consider the possible spatial correlation in entire geographic areas within distance bands around community colleges that are specified by the researcher. Compared to binary contiguity weight matrices, IDS weight matrices are more robust to misspecification.

To identify such an institution in IPEDS, we used all seven IPEDS metrics delineating an institution's type and kept all the institutions who met all seven criteria and had no missing years of data. The dependent variable is operating costs, which are quantified as education and general expenditures (E&G) aggregated at the institution level, to include expenditures on instruction, research, public service, academic support, student services, institutional support, operations and maintenance (Fig. 1) . While it is common to think of community colleges as only producing associate degrees, Horn et al. (2009) report that many of these institutions award almost as many certificates as associate degrees yearly. Therefore, applying microeconomic cost theory, the number of associate degrees and the number of short (1-year), medium (1-to 2-years) and long (2-to 4-years) term certificates are outputs in the quadratic cost function. As previously discussed, community colleges produce little to no research (Agasisti & Belfield, 2017) . While Sav, (2012) Table 1 ), our data spanning 2004-2018 shows the average research expenditure is $25,844, with 90% of the data points reporting zero expenditures on research.

Specifically, twelve credits minimum of coursework is considered full-time, so two part-time students, one taking nine credits and one enrolled for three credits, are normalized to one full-time equivalent student. Reed (2016) and Staff (2017) emphasize the unique features of community colleges, who are open door institutions, and serve a disproportionately large number of part-time students (59.3% in our data) relative to their four-year higher education institution counterparts. With such a high fraction of part-time students, FTE is no longer an optimal measure. Intuitively, the FTE equivalency is not ideal given a few very common occurrences: each student is eligible for financial aid, which entails significant administrative work whether the student attends part-or full-time; each student must have individual registrar records kept, a labor cost that is the same whether the student is part-or full-time and; each student uses support services regardless of part-versus full-time attendance (Reed, 2016) . Therefore, the current study uses total enrollment rather than FTE as a measure. Demographic variables include nonwhite students and the percent of enrolled students under the age of 25.",

To see if multicollinearity biases the GTRE model results, we repeat the analysis in five scenarios: (i) the first analysis includes total enrollment (shown below); (ii) the second one excludes total enrollment; (iii) the next three models each include various moving averages of total enrollment (3, 4 and 5 year) and; (iv) the last model includes a three-level categorical variable for size of institution based on the cutoffs for the 33rd percentile enrollment, 66th and over.

The benefit of state and time fixed effects is as follows: state fixed effects are meant to capture unobserved characteristics pertaining to each state individually that affect the community colleges within that state but may be different in other states; time fixed effects account for events that take place at a particular point in time and impact all institutions. It is important to note that the state is the unit of analysis for state fixed effects, which is different from the spatial analysis employed, which helps connect the costs of institutions (not states) in proximity to each other, which often means across state lines. The distance is calculated using latitude and longitude coordinates and it does not account for state lines, but simply for distance. It further allows us to capture the differences in costs between rural and urban institutions whether they are in the same or different states.",

To account for differences across states, a binary variable reflecting whether the state has a governing board for community colleges, or some other coordinating entity is created (McGuinness, 2014) . Because each institution has one persistent efficiency index, due to the time invariant nature of this metric, the index is regressed on the 14-year institution average of the demographic and financial variables. This cross-sectional data regression is estimated via the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) method, with correction for heteroskedasticity (Table 5 ) All financial variables except state funding are statistically significant. From Table 5 , a 1% increase in federal funding is associated with an approximate 0.3% (Model 2 and Model 3) decrease in long-term efficiency, on average, holding all else constant. The relationship between Pell grants and long-term efficiency is similar in magnitude, 0.3%, but positive. The decrease in cost efficiency following a 1% increase in local funding is a much smaller (less than Fig. 8 Kernel density of the persistent/long run cost efficiency indices 0.01%). Tuition revenue also has a negligible impact on long-run cost efficiency. Community colleges located in urban and suburban areas are less cost efficient than those in a rural setting. Persistent efficiency is positively related to the presence of a governing board in Model 1 (beta = 0.028, psss< 0.0001), but negatively related in Model 2 and 3 (beta = \u22120.022 and, respectively, \u2212 0.024, both p < 0.001). Similarly, the ratio of part-time faculty reveals a positive, but negligible impact on persistent efficiency in Model 1, but negative in Model 2 and 3.

Equity as it pertains to the mission and open acceptance policy of community colleges is an important issue for policy makers, campus management and researchers alike (Dowd & Shieh. 2013; Baker & Levin, 2017) . Dowd and Shieh (2013) argue that whether community colleges are cost efficient does not detract from the fact that they offer access to higher education to many who could otherwise not likely pursue higher education. In this way, efficiency and equity can sometimes conflict with one another, although they are not always incompatible (Dowd & Shieh, 2013) . Due to the negligible size of the estimated coefficients for the demographic variables, our findings suggest that equity and efficiency are not at odds for public community colleges. Overall, the results indicate that long-term inefficiency is most likely the result of long-term management errors and repeated misallocation of resources that are difficult to change over time, rather than the factors investigated in this analysis. The top 20 most long-term cost-efficient institutions over the 2004-2017 fiscal year period are listed in Table 6 . The top five include Illinois Eastern Community Colleges-Wabash Valley College (IL), University of New Mexico-Los Alamos Campus (NM), New Mexico State University-Grants (NM), Ohio State University Agricultural Technical Institute (OH), and Cowley County Community College (KS). Except for the last one, all these community colleges are either branch campuses of four-year institutions or located within multi-college districts. While we cannot draw conclusions based on the results of this study, these factors suggest that these community colleges may be engaged in cost sharing with their respective \"parent\" institution or \"main'' campus. Additional observations reveal that Seminole State College (OK) and University Of New Mexico-Los Alamos Campus (NM) have resident partners in the area that provide project-based work experience during for-credit internship courses, thus sharing the cost of the student education. Sandhills Community College (NC) established a partnership with the county school system, where, at the conclusion of a five-year plan of study, graduates will receive a high school diploma and an Associate of Arts degree, thus sharing the cost ",

            "text": "Both short term and long-term efficiency are of great importance to campus leaders and policy makers on their own merit. The former reveals that institutions are very effective (90%) at responding to changes in market conditions. Long-term efficiency (87%) indicates room for improvement, potentially due to structural management problems and misallocation of resources over the long-term. This finding is consistent with past studies (e.g., Titus et al. 2017) examining the difference between short term and persistent efficiency but is a unique contribution to the study of efficiency of community colleges. One practical implication of this study is that community colleges should be nimble in responding to market changes to maximize cost efficiency. Like any other institutions of higher education, community colleges can be bureaucratic in nature and change can be slow. Higher education administrators and community college practitioners may find this task daunting and difficult. Such change, however, is not impossible and requires investment at the state and local level (Maliszewski et al. 2012) . One suggestion that has not been empirically studied is to improve long term efficiency by creating cost sharing partnerships with important state level stakeholders. In the section above, we highlighted how cost-efficient community colleges partnered with state and regional workforce development agencies. Other partnerships may include the American Association of Community Colleges or specific-state organizational entities such as the Massachusetts-based Partnership to Advance Collaboration and Efficiencies (PACE). Campus leaders and policy makers alike could develop strategic plans and funding alternatives based on inferences made from yearly data on short-run cost efficiency. Since short-run cost inefficiency captures the one-time management errors or incorrect responses to changes in market conditions and factor prices (e.g., faculty and staff salaries) at one point in time, assessing and encouraging learning from previous mistakes is essential. To see if such learning is happening, we compute the changes in short-run efficiency indices between all consecutive years and then average them. We find that 537 of the 752 institutions studied have a positive average, showing that they may indeed be learning from their mistakes. One way to ensure learning from past mistakes is from experience sharing among community colleges: institutions with increases in short-run efficiency over time may share their experiences and best management practices with their counterparts.",

Equity of what and whom could be considered through the lens of long-term efficiency. The analysis showed that the percentage of students under the age of 25 is positively associated with long-run cost efficiency, but the relationship is negative for minority students. In terms of size, there is a negligible negative relationship between the percentage of minorities and long-term cost efficiency, and a small positive one when considering the percentage of students under age 25. This finding, which is consistent with past research on the efficiency of community colleges (Agasisti & Belfield, 2017) , may reflect minority students and non-traditional students completing degrees and certificates at lower rates. Consequently, additional support to improve completion rates may be needed (National Center for Education Statistics, 2019).",

However, not all community college students complete a sub-baccalaureate credential, as many students transfer prior to completion. Unfortunately, there is an absence of data tracking transfer students across various institutions (Jenkins & Fink, 2016) due to current federal regulations, which prevent scholars from tracking students across institutions. Furthermore, there is currently no unifying definition of transfer rates. Recent research on student mobility has indicated that the transfer function has diversified to become a multifaceted experience (Taylor & Jain, 2017) , with eight different patterns of transfer: vertical; lateral; reverser; reverse credit; swirlers and alternating enrollees; concurrent enrollees, co-enrollment, double-dipping, simultaneous enrollees; dual credit, dual enrollment; and transient. Further, with over 70% of students transferring laterally from a two-year to a two-year or four-year to a four-year institution, vertical transfer is no longer the dominant pathway (Taylor & Jain, 2017) . This makes tracking transfer students a challenge. When considering implications for community college efficiency, it is important to keep in mind the currently unmeasurable impact transfer students may have on an institution's output of associate degrees and certificates.",

Despite the ubiquity of transfer, data including transfer rates is extremely limited, as it is not captured at the federal level and states have different methods of measuring transfer (Jenkins & Fink, 2016) .
