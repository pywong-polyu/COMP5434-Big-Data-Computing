Relatively little is known about the impact of the pandemic on disordered eating behaviors (DEB) for these populations. The aim of this study is to understand changes in DEB across COVID-19 within an LGBTQ+ sample, with a particular focus on differences across sexual and gender identities, and the impact of social support on these outcomes. In a sample of 830 LGBTQ+ adults with a past year history of DEB, most, but not all, participants reported that the frequency of and urge to engage in each DEB increased a little bit or a lot during COVID-19. Contrary to research showing more severe psychopathology and DEB among gender minorities (GM) compared to sexual minorities (SM), changes in DEB severity since COVID-19 were not significantly different between SM and GM participants. There were a few small and significant relationships between changes in average DEB severity and characteristics of interpersonal relationships, average quality of home relationships, and living with someone not affirming of one's identity. Results highlight that COVID-19 may have exacerbated DEB for SGM young adults, that these changes were not different across sexual versus gender minorities, and that these changes are weakly but significantly related to minority stressors.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic in March 2020 (World Health Organization, 2020), after which time, countries adopted varying levels of preventive measures to slow the spread of the virus. Such measures included social distancing, community curfews, restrictions on social gatherings, transitions to working from home, and mandatory stay-at-home orders. Consequences of these measures included limited social interaction, increases in unemployment or changes in job stability, and decreased access to recreational activities.",

Yet, most research on COVID-19 to-date has involved primarily cisgender, heterosexual participants and/or has not assessed sexuality and gender. There has been a call to action for evaluating the pandemic's impacts on vulnerable and minoritized groups and within specific types of psychopathology (Holmes, 2020) . To address this call to action, this paper analyzes the impact of COVID-19 on eating pathology in LGBTQ+ (e.g., those identifying as lesbian, gay, bisexual, pansexual, transgender, gender non-conforming, queer, and questioning, as well as those engaging in some same gender sexual behavior or experiencing some sexual/romantic attraction to others of the same gender) young adults.",

For example, COVID-19 and related restrictions have led to substantial changes in routine, food availability, cultural messages, restricted healthcare access, and restricted exercise. As a result, people's relationships with food, eating, and their bodies may be particularly vulnerable (Cooper et al., 2020) . Supporting this possibility, COVID-19 stay-at-home orders resulted in periodic sparsely stocked grocery stores, increased cultural messages around weight gain (e.g., 'gaining the COVID-19'), and closing and reopening of fitness centers and opportunities; each of these has been associated with restrictive eating and overeating, as well as changes in focus on body weight and shape (e.g., Chen, Poon, DeWall, & Jiang, 2020; Cooper et al., 2020; Jim\u00e9nez-Pav\u00f3n, Carbonell-Baeza, & Lavie, 2020; Termorshuizen et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "In addition to direct impacts on food, eating, and exercise, COVID-19 likely increased broader risk factors (Cooper et al., 2020) and decreased typical protective factors for eating pathology (Rodgers et al., 2020) . With unprecedented instability since the start of the pandemic, generalized anxiety, stressful life events (SLEs), and trauma and abuse increased for many people (Cooper et al., 2020) , likely exerting adverse effects on mental health, including eating pathology (Fern\u00e1ndez-Aranda et al., 2020) . At the same time, the pandemic simultaneously set up a context that decreased traditional supports and promotive factors. For example, social distancing mandates and/or fear of contagion decreased social support and increased social isolation (Rodgers et al., 2020) . Given that people in the LGBTQ+ community, compared to their cisgender heterosexual peers, report higher rates of eating pathology (Hazzard et al., n.d.) and more negative impacts across a range of domains from COVID-19 (Drabble, 2021) , it is particularly important to examine eating pathology during COVID-19 in this community. In terms of COVID-19 impacts, job loss or insecurity, changes in schooling structure, and general financial instability disproportionately impacted LGBTQ+ young adults (Drabble, 2021) , leading to added stress and financial hardship in this community. Likely related to these financial difficulties, many LGBTQ+ young adults had to move back in with family members during some parts of the pandemic. Whereas parents who are accepting can be a major protective factor against psychopathology and suicidal behaviors, familial rejection is a predictor of negative health outcomes in LGBTQ+ people (McCormick & Baldridge, 2019; Ryan, Russell, Huebner, Diaz, & Sanchez, 2010) . Thus, this move likely increased many LGBTQ+ young adults' exposure to rejection and stress from (MacCarthy et al., 2020; Suen, Chan, & Wong, 2020) while simultaneously separating them from their supportive social networks. These connections typically help to provide community and buffer the effects of homophobic microagressions (Kalb, Brodkin, Goldstein, & Gillis, 2020; Kuyper & Fokkema, 2010) .",

Those interested (n = 2900) were directed to a website, hosted in Qualtrics, describing the inclusion criteria and study details. Those that met inclusion criteria (18-30 years old, living in the USA, English proficiency, identify as a sexual or gender minority) were prompted to read the consent form; upon providing an electronic signature, participants completed a comprehension check of the study's procedures, including risk and benefit understanding and confidentiality guidelines. To participate in the study, participants had to answer all questions correctly, and to pass a reCaptcha to prevent fraudulent and abusive responses. The Qualtrics survey was created to prevent 'ballot box stuffing', so that people from the same IP address could not participate twice. Of those that clicked on the link, 2285 provided study consent and successfully completed the consent quiz; 1877 participants began the survey, and 1324 people completed the study. One in five participants were randomly selected to win a $15 electronic gift card within 48 h of study completion. After participating, all participants were provided a debriefing form describing the purpose of the study, thanking them for their time, and listing a series of electronic mental health and crisis resources.

For this study, we exclusively focused on items assessing financial difficulties due to COVID-19 and reduced access to physical and mental healthcare. Because we looked at these items individually, we are not able to evaluate their psychometric properties for this study. The Quality of Relationships Inventory (QRI)-support scale (Pierce, Sarason, Sarason, Solky-Butzel, & Nagle, 1997 ) was used to assess the perceived availability of social support for each person participants lived with since COVID-19-related social isolation orders were instituted. The QRI has high construct validity and reliability (\u03b1 = 0.733 to 0.826) (Yearwood Travezan, Vliegen, Luyten, Chau, & Corveleyn, 2018). In the present study, participants were asked to fill out the 7-item QRI on a scale from 1 (not at all) to 4 (very much) for each person they lived with; we then took the mean of these QRI scores to represent the average home relationship. We assessed Cronbach's alpha for each relationship assessed within the QRI; scores ranged from 0.81 to 0.96.",

For restrictive eating, the Dietary Restriction Screener 2 (DRS-2; Haynos & Fruzzetti, 2015) was used to assess whether participants had engaged in restrictive eating over the past year. The DRS-2 has not previously been examined in a sample consisting exclusively of gender and sexual minorities. We selected items from the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire (Fairburn & Beglin, 2008) to assess whether participants had engaged in binge eating (i.e., \"How many times have you eaten what other people would regard as an unusually large amount of food [given the circumstances] AND had a sense of lost control over your eating?\") and compensatory behaviors (i.e., \"How many times have you done any of the following as a means of controlling your shape or weight: made yourself sick [e.g., vomited], taken laxatives, exercised in a 'driven' or 'compulsive' way?\") in the past year. Prior to this study, the EDE-Q has been used to successfully interpret disordered eating attitudes and behaviors in gender-expansive samples (Nagata, Compte, Cattle, et al., 2020a; Nagata, Ganson, & Austin, 2020b) . Next, participants were asked whether they experienced changes in the urge (\"How has the urge to engage in __ behaviors changed since the start of COVID-19?\") and frequency (\"How has the frequency in which you engage in ___ behaviors changed since the start of COVID-19\") of each behavior since the start of COVID-19. Response options included: 'Decreased a lot' (1), 'Decreased a little bit' (2), 'Has not changed' (3), 'Decreased a little bit' (4), and 'Increased a lot' (5). We combined the urge and frequency items for each DEB to provide an index of behavior severity change since the start of COVID-19; Cronbach's alphas were 0.71, 0.81, and 0.69 for restrictive eating, binge eating, and compensatory behaviors, respectively.",

Most participants endorsed an increase in both frequency of and urge to engage in DEB, though a non-negligible minority of participants in each category (up to 10%) endorsed a decrease in frequency of an urge to engage in DEB. We also examined differences in average change in DEB severity between SM and GM participants, using a composite measure of change in DEB severity (defined as an average change in frequency of and urge to engage in each DEB). Contrary to hypotheses, there were no statistically significant differences between these groups. Results suggest that, although GM people report higher rates of disordered eating than their SM counterparts (Simone et al., 2020) , the pandemic impacted these groups similarly.",

Considering those engaging in past year restrictive eating, quality of home relationships, non-affirming living environment, and overall friend support were not significantly associated with changes in the restrictive eating severity composite score. However, there was a weak negative association between overall family support and restrictive eating severity. When considering those engaging in past year binge eating, patterns were quite similar. Quality of home relationships, family support, and overall friend support were not significantly associated with changes in the binge eating severity composite score. However, there was a weak positive association between non-affirming living environment and binge eating severity. Patterns were even weaker when considering compensatory behaviors, with no significant associations emerging. Study results should be interpreted in light of its limitations. For example, most participants in the present study were white; lack of racial and ethnic diversity in this sample constrains the external validity of our findings. In light of the severe racial and ethnic disparities regarding impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States (e.g., Liu & Modir, 2021) , future work should examine pandemic-related patterns of change in DEB specifically among LGBTQ+ youth of color. There are also inherent limitations in the use of a retrospective selfreport measure of DEB; it is possible that some participants misunderstood or misreported their disordered eating behaviors. Finally, because data collection took place relatively soon after the initial implementation of COVID-19 restrictions, results might differ if the survey were to be readministered now, later into the pandemic. Studies leveraging longitudinal designs would be better suited to better understand the impact of the pandemic on eating disordered symptoms.",

It is possible that sexual and gender minorities do differ in DEB, but respond to COVID-19 related stressors with similar changes. This is likely because prior to the pandemic, research found higher rates of DEB among gender minorities compared to sexual minority individuals (Nagata et al., 2020a (Nagata et al., , 2020b . Possible future directions include the use of a sample enriched for individuals with eating disorders (due to the low base rate in the general population), as well as further exploration of how the nature of specific DEB may have changed due to COVID (e.g., more secretive purging behaviors, being unable to eat usual foods during a binge episode). It would also be interesting to look at youth under 18 years of age, especially since factors in the home environment may have a larger impact in this population.",
