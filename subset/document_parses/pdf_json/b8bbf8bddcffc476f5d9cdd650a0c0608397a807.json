E-learning is defined as an elaborate response aiming at continuing education during the COVID-19 pandemic. It seems that developed countries have established and adjusted their technological infrastructures for the transition from a face-to-face education to a digital one. In contrast, developing countries were not completely prepared for this transition. Improper and deficient technological and practical fundamentals have been causing problems for all students, instructors, and other involved individuals. Therefore, we reviewed the challenges that have arisen from e-learning during the COVID-19 outbreak in different parts of tertiary education focusing on underprivileged countries.",

            "text": "The newly emerged COVID-19 pandemic brought about a global crisis affecting all aspects of human life. During about 10 months, more than 200 countries throughout the world had to socially, economically, environmentally, and clinically cope with the pandemic (Aloysius et al. 2020 ) (Gholipour et al. 2021; Gholipour et al. 2020) . These effects can be directly related to the pandemic, such as increased generation of medical waste (Kalantary et al. 2021) , or indirectly related to the consequences of the pandemic in changing the lifestyle of citizens such as reducing waste recycling (Yousefi et al. 2021) . To reduce the transmission of the disease, many businesses have been suspended or shut down. Service delivery systems have received more funds, and institutes offering traditional or face-to-face education have been closed and forced to migrate to e-learning and distance education (Mishra et al. 2020; Donthu and Gustafsson 2020; Favale et al. 2020) . The COVID-19 pandemic has led to using specific guidelines for many activities in the community such as education, business, and municipal services ). E-learning is defined as a flexible, interactive, self-pacing, and elaborate pedagogical method introducing educational approaches using a wide variety of platforms. After the spread of COVID-19, universities and educational institutes had two options for the migration to e-learning; the first option was buying or using other platforms, and universities had to integrate the present distance-learning platforms. The other option was for the universities to create or use their own platforms (Adedoyin and Soykan 2020) . Regardless of the selected way of transitioning from traditional education to a distance one, e-learning can bring about some benefits, especially for the future plans for developing distance learning. To exemplify, by running a wellrounded digital platform, universities become prepared for possible health emergencies and crises. In addition, they can end up with a huge number of innovations making significant positive effects on education (Brem et al. 2020) . Interestingly, during the closure of universities and educational institutes, the internet traffic used by e-learning platforms was employed as an up-to-the-minute way to identify the marginalized or needy students and individuals for further financial and social support (Adedoyin and Soykan 2020) .",

            "text": "It is estimated that the COVID-19 outbreak has confined a large number of students to their homes. In these conditions, students have to attend their classes in different platforms and using digital education. One of the main requirements of distance learning is a safe and fast internet connection. Access to the technical requirements of online education is not a significant problem in developed countries because laptops and smartphones with a high-speed internet connection are available for almost all the students and teachers in different parts of these countries (Ahmadi and Ilmiani 2020) ; however, as shown in Fig. 1 , online courses might be completely or partially inaccessible to the students in developing countries due to a poor internet connection and also in many cases students may stay logged out (Sangster et al. 2020; Diab and Elgahsh 2020) . In developing countries, a number of students especially those who are living in rural and underprivileged areas do not have access to sufficient and efficient internet connection, which leads to several problems in their education. For example, during city lockdown, about 70% of Indian students attended online classes, the majority of which used android smartphones, but digital platforms used for e-learning are not compatible with smartphones. This also deteriorates the students' performance (Adedoyin and Soykan 2020) . They also mentioned that houses were not a desirable location for studying. More than 30% of the students complained about poor internet connection. All those problems led to self-mentioned depression, stress, and anxiety in 42% of the students (Kapasia et al. 2020 ). Based on the students' perspective in India, 77% of the studied students noted that their main problems in participating in online examinations were internet connectivity (Bisht et al. 2020 ). In addition to connection-related problems, not all the students could afford to purchase a laptop or a personal computer. It has been reported that a great number of students come from poor or low-income families (Fry and Cilluffo 2019) , and preparing technological requirements for remote education is really hard for these students and their families, which leads to educational inequalities (Hasan et al. 2020; Wong et al. 2015) . The lack of access to updated technologies can also cause psychological distress. It has been proven that the risk of mental stress arising from inequalities in poor students is approximately high (Jiang and Review 2020) . For example, 63% of nursing students in Nepal felt anxiety because of the problems that occurred during online classes (Subedi et al. 2020) .",

The home environment is not a suitable location for education because students may get distracted by other family members or pets. For example, at the time of interviews, tests, homework, or other educational activities, students might get distracted and not be able to meet their assignments' deadlines (Sangster et al. 2020 ). In addition, using outdated tools might hamper the availability of educational content offered in distance learning. It is also reported that students were faced with different problems when taking e-quizzes because of using outdated software and hardware (Bisht et al. 2020 ). Out-of-date digital tools might not be compatible with suitable browsers for e-learning, and the possibility of losing scores for marginalized students is higher than others. For instance, in the study on the students of STKIP Pamane Talino Philippines, 78% of the participants mentioned that incompatibility of their gadgets with educational platforms caused some problems because they had to use their smartphone to attend online classes, which required installing and reinstalling several applications and unreasonably filling up their phone memories (Agung and Surtikanti 2020) . Based on the students' perception, Whatsapp was the most internet-friendly application for online classes (Agung and Surtikanti 2020) .",

In a study conducted in Pakistan, expensive internet connection was considered a problem of online education by 11% of undergraduates and postgraduates (Adnan and Anwar 2020). Moreover, to use digital libraries, internet connection and membership fee are needed; however, several universities do not have digital libraries to offer their students. In addition, the quality and quantity of e-content and e-resources for students is not enough, especially in developing countries, because these countries were not ready for these conditions in advance, and they do not have suitable or complete digital infrastructures (Adnan and Anwar 2020) . Lack of interaction with instructors and fellow students is another major problem. Based on the results of a study conducted in Iran, medical students stated lack of teacher interaction as a significant challenge during the COVID-19 spread (Afshari et al. 2020) . Some students are classified as tactile learners who need to have discussions with their teachers in a face-to-face manner to understand the complicated digitally taught content. All these problems might lead to stress and consequently, mental health issues in marginalized students, and these inequalities are inconsistent with educational justice (Britt 2006) .",

The issues related to e-learning for instructors are not specific to developing countries; nevertheless, owing to the fact that this educational method has recently been launched in these countries, they might face newer problems which they have not encountered before (Chang and Fang 2020) (see Table 1 ). Setting up a new pedagogical method creates a significant additional workload for instructors. For example, it is time-consuming work to properly hold user-friendly classes and upload them to a digital platform. Things get worse when trainers do not have enough technical knowledge to utilize virtual platforms (Bhuasiri et al. 2012; Abdel-Gawad et al. 2015; Alqahtani and Rajkhan 2020) . Based on the internet-based responses of instructors, 30% of teachers have felt psychological stress due to an increased workload during the COVID-19 outbreak. Moreover, 70% of them have experienced increased workload (Chang and Fang 2020) . Many of the instructors in developing countries are inexperienced in turning their knowledge into virtual content. The e-learning method requires several hours of thinking to find out how a concept can be taught in the form of virtual education. Additionally, it is a tough job to keep students motivated, and teachers have to think critically to encourage learners to meet their assignments' deadlines (Alqahtani and Rajkhan 2020).",

In addition, after selecting the correct way, the instructors should convert their assessment method to an online standard one which is rather difficult. Nguyen et al.

For example, in Iraq and Syria, they lost their technological infrastructure because of war, and facing the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the situation (Hussein et al. 2020) . In these areas, national radio and television programs can be used to broadcast primary or secondary school classes instead of holding online classes (Gyimah 2020); however, it seems that this method does not work for tertiary education.

The ICT experts must technically and practically support both instructors and students and also present reports to the heads of faculties and universities. With the emerging of COVID-19, the workload of the ICT and IT experts has especially rocketed. In Nigeria, a limited adaptation of ICT has been reported, and ICT experts are not well-trained to facilitate virtual learning (Lawal et al. 2020) . Newly adjusted platforms in many cases require updating or repairing, which increases the workload and burden of ICT experts. Almost all universities that did not have e-learning platforms had to provide or purchase one. ICT experts are the means of communication between universities and the providers of these platforms, and they have to make a number of calls to find a better and compatible platform for universities. After buying the platform, updating and upgrading it and finding its shortcomings are the responsibility of the ICT experts (Adedoyin and Soykan 2020). At the same time, they have to arrange different workshops for instructors aiming at teaching them to produce educational materials or upload the materials, etc. In addition, almost every day, they are being called for technical support by instructors or students (Adedoyin and Soykan 2020).",

Firstly, universities and educational institutes gained insight about their shortcomings and are more prepared to cope with a similar and possible pandemic situation. For example, China was able to deal with the transition from traditional education to a digital one because it had a valuable experience of fighting with SARS and MERS. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic forced universities to improve their technological infrastructures for distance learning so they can continue their courses during other health emergencies. Moreover, learners and teachers tried to improve their digital knowledge to participate in online classes. Most importantly, these limitations and difficulties have led to a great number of innovations for the promotion and development of e-learning methods. For example, several approaches have been introduced to minimize cheating in digital examinations. In some areas, technological innovations driven from improved digital collaborations helped to bring about some scientific achievements for the eradication of the pandemic.",

Despite the difficulties caused by COVID-19 in educational systems, there have been some benefits as well. Defective infrastructures have been improved in a short time.
