We reported the antileishmanial activity of A. nilotica bark methanolic extract through in vitro antileishmanial assays and dissected the mechanism of its action through in silico studies. Bark methanolic extract exhibited antipromastigote and antiamastigote potential in a time and dose-dependent manner with IC 50 values of 19.6 \u00b1 0.9037 and 77.52 \u00b1 5.167 \u03bcg/mL, respectively.

The major constituents identified by gas chromatography\u2212mass spectrometry (GC\u2212MS) analysis, 13-docosenoic acid, lupeol, 9,12-octadecadienoic acid, and 6-octadecanoic acid, showed effective binding with the potential drug targets of Leishmania donovani (L. donovani) including sterol 24-c-methyltransferase, trypanothione reductase, pteridine reductase, and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase, suggesting the possible mechanism of its antileishmanial action. Pharmacokinetic studies on major phytoconstituents analyzed by GC\u2212MS supported their use as safe antileishmanial drug candidates.

            "text": "Visceral leishmaniasis (VL), also known as kala-azar in the Indian subcontinent, is a fatal form of the vector-borne disease caused by protozoan parasite Leishmania donovani. The disease remained endemic in more than 88 countries around the globe, while 95% of cases are concentrated in 7\u22128 countries. 1 More than 50% of the global burden of VL is found in the Indian subcontinent (India, Bangladesh, and Nepal). 2, 3 The disease is proved to be fatal if left untreated in more than 95% of cases because of secondary infection and anemia. 4 VL is ranked second in the mortality rate among the neglected tropical diseases. 5, 6 It is a significant problem for the economically weaker section of the society. Due to their unhygienic living environment, they are more vulnerable to the disease. 7 Illiteracy is another factor that is directly proportional to the lack of awareness which led to major morbidity and mortality. The available chemotherapy of VL is limited and undermined by drug resistance. Currently, in general, the drug used in the Indian subcontinent sodium antimony gluconate showed no response in more than 64% of the patients due to the development of resistance against the parasites. 8 Miltefosine, amphotericin B, and its lipid formulations have several limitations because of high toxicity, cost, and unavailability, which limit their use. The present scenario of disease and its limited treatment options demand an urgent need to develop a promising and cost-effective operational drug to overcome the disease. To date, a large number of medicinal plants and their extracts had been studied for antileishmanial activity and proved to be potential therapeutic options. 9, 10 Here, we planned to explore the antileishmanial activity of the medicinal plant, Acacia nilotica. A. nilotica is commonly known as babul and belongs to the family Fabaceae of genus Acacia. It is an important medicinal plant, found in Africa, the Middle East, and the Indian subcontinent. 11\u221213 It is rich in secondary metabolites including condensed tannins, flavonoids, gums, and phlobatannins. 14, 15 Every part of the plant possesses a wide array of biologically active, therapeutically potential com-pounds that are used in the traditional system of medicine as a remedy for various diseases. Its different parts are used in the treatment of different diseases such as floral parts for gastrointestinal disorders, 16 leaf extracts for cancer and microbial infections, 17, 18 root extracts for tuberculosis and liver disorders, 19 and bark for bacterial infections including cold, bronchitis, dysentery, biliousness, cholera, and bleeding piles. 14,20\u221222 Keeping the rich antimicrobial bioactive collection of the bark of A. nilotica, in mind, we planned to study its antileishmanial potential here. We also tried to dissect the mechanism of its antileishmanial action through different in silico approaches. Sterol 24-c-methyltransferase (SMT), trypanothione reductase (TR), pteridine reductase (PTR1), and adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (APRT) are prerequisite enzymes for survival, pathogenicity, and transmission of L. donovani. Therefore, we selected these potential drug targets for the molecular docking study of major constituents of bark extract identified by gas chromatography\u2212mass spectrometry (GC\u2212MS), with these mentioned potential drug targets of Leishmania.",

Growth kinetics was assessed for 7 days; there was a gradual decrease in the promastigote proliferation at all the doses (Figure 1a ). The promastigote culture was completely shattered at the dose concentrations of 250 and 500 \u03bcg/mL of A. nilotica after 3 days of treatment.

Plant extract treatment reduced the intramacrophagic parasites in a dose-dependent manner with an IC 50 value of 77.52 \u00b1 5.167 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 2a ). Miltefosine was taken as a positive control (Figure 2a ). Cell cytotoxicity (CC 50 ) of A. nilotica methanolic extract was evaluated along with miltefosine as a positive control on THP-1-differentiated macrophages to study its safe dose. THP-1-differentiated macrophages were incubated with different concentrations of extract/miltefosine (0\u22121000 \u03bcg/mL), and the cell viability was assessed using the 3-(4,5 dimethyl-thiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. It was observed that A. nilotica has the least cytotoxic effect on the viability and morphology of the macrophages with a CC 50 value of 432.7 \u00b1 7.71 \u03bcg/mL, while miltefosine showed higher toxicity with a CC 50 value of 8.219 \u00b1 0.6337 \u03bcg/mL (Figure 2b) . A significant reduction in the intramacrophagic parasite count was observed in the micrographs of Giemsa-stained infected and extract-treated macrophages (Figure 2c ).",

The TR and SMT enzymes were modeled using Modeller 9.24, and the energy minimization was carried out by BIOVIA Discovery Studio. The threedimensional (3D) cartoon representation of TR and SMT enzymes is shown in Figures S1A and S2A . The models were selected by analyzing their stereochemical quality using the PROCHECK program. The generated models of TR and SMT show a good quality structure having 99.8 and 99% residues in the allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, respectively (Figures S1B and S2B). The PDBsum tool was used to analyze and found that the 3D structure of the enzyme is composed of mixed \u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strand (\u03b1 + \u03b2) secondary structures. 23 The structural topology of TR and SMT showed 5 sheets, 23 strands, 18 helices, and 34 \u03b2 turns and 2 sheets, 10 strands, 14 helices, and 41 \u03b2 turns, respectively (Figures S1C,D and S2C,D). Multiple sequence alignments were performed, and Discovery Studio was used to find the key residues and regions around the binding cavity of TR and SMT. The active site residues of the SMT, TR, PTR1, and APT enzymes making different numbers of hydrogen bonds as well as hydrophobic bonds with the ligands were also identified.

Lipinski's \"rule of five\" is an analytical approach for predicting drug-likeness stating that molecules had molecular weight (MW \u2264 500 Da), high lipophilicity expressed as log P (log P \u2264 5), hydrogen bond donors (HBDs \u2264 5), and hydrogen bond acceptors (HBAs \u2264 10) with good absorption or permeation across the cell membrane.

            "text": "Plant extracts have promising medicinal properties and are extensively used in the traditional system of medicine due to the presence of many active phytoconstituents. 30 From the previous studies, it has been revealed that many medicinal plant extracts and their secondary metabolite contents have proven to be efficient and low-toxic antileishmanial drug candidates. 31, 32 A. nilotica, which has been identified as potential medicinal plants, is rich in secondary metabolites. Studies based on the GC\u2212MS analysis of A. nilotica showed the presence of different types of secondary plant metabolites including polyphenols, mainly composed of condensed tannin and phlobatannin in addition to gallic acid, ellagic acid, catechin, epigallocatechin-7-gallate, flavonoids, and gum. 15 Different solvent extracts of A. nilotica had been shown to have antimicrobial activities including antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and antiamoebic. 20, 33, 34 We evaluated the antileishmanial potential of A. nilotica and identified its secondary metabolite constituents by GC\u2212MS analysis. A. nilotica bark methanolic extract inhibited the growth of L. donovani promastigotes in a time and dose-dependent manner. It induced morphological changes and a cytocidal mode of parasite killing. The cytocidal mode of the killing of A. nilotica maybe because of its richness in phenolic compounds, 35 which may cause irreversible changes to the cell membrane. 36 Methanolic extract of the fruit of A. nilotica had been reported to have antileishmanial activity with an IC 50 value of 89.38 \u03bcg/ mL on the Leishmania major promastigotes. 37 We determined the IC 50 value of A. nilotica on L. donovani as 19.6 \u00b1 0.9037 \u03bcg/mL, which was higher in comparison to the IC 50 value of positive control miltefosine (3.118 \u00b1 0.2395 \u03bcg/mL). However, the CC 50 value of A. nilotica on macrophages was determined as 432.7 \u00b1 7.71 \u03bcg/mL, while that of the miltefosine was 8.219 \u00b1 0.6337 \u03bcg/mL. The plant extract significantly inhibited the growth of the intramacrophagic form of the parasites. The IC 50 value of the extract on the amastigote form was calculated as 77.52 \u00b1 5.167 \u03bcg/mL. A. nilotica was found to have low cytotoxicity even after having a higher IC 50 value as compared to the miltefosine. Therefore, the higher concentration of A. nilotica can be used to inhibit the growth of amastigotes inside macrophages. The major constituents identified through GC\u2212MS analysis were 13-docosenoic acid (34.06%), lupeol (20.15%), 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (9.92%), and 6-octadecanoic acid (8.43%). To dissect the mechanism of antileishmanial activity of A. nilotica, we further performed the molecular docking study of major constituents of extract identified by GC\u2212MS, with essential enzymes of Leishmania including SMT, TR, PTR1, and APRT. These enzymes play an essential role in parasite growth, survival, virulence, and transmission inside the host. SMT is required for the biosynthesis of ergosterol, the major membrane sterol in L. donovani. 38 The enzyme TR followed the thiol-redox metabolism to keep trypanothione in a reduced form. This antioxidant property of TR is essential for the survival of L. donovani. 39 PTR1 catalyzed the reduction of conjugated and nonconjugated pterins such as reduced biopterin to dihydrobiopterin. 40 APRT plays a vital role in the purine metabolism by converting 6-aminopurines into 6-oxypurines. 41 Molecular docking results proved that lupeol and 9,12octadecadienoic acid possessed higher binding affinity with SMT, TR, PTR1, and APRT, as shown in Table 2 .",

The majority of the compounds were identified as nontoxic chemicals, whereas lupeol was a class 5 chemical with very low toxic effects. 42 The pharmacokinetic attributes were in favor of these compounds to be exploited as promising antileishmanial drug candidates. The earlier studies had reported that at low concentrations, the ethyl-acetate extract of A. nilotica husk induced an increased number of human lymphocyte cell count. This property of the extract may be considered as a human immunity booster. 43 Thus, in vitro, molecular docking, pharmacokinetic studies, bioactivity scores, and acute toxicity studies suggested possible Pune, India.

Bark identification was done at the National Institute of Science Communication and Information Resources (NISCAIR), New Delhi, India. The selected plant material was washed and airdried in shade at room temperature. The powdered plant materials were soaked in methanol and placed on a rotary shaker at room temperature for 24 h. The extract was filtered and concentrated using a rotatory evaporator under vacuum at 35\u00b0C. The dried plant extract was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until used for bioassay. To evaluate the antipromastigote potential of A. nilotica, stationary phase (2 \u00d7 10 6 cells/mL) promastigotes were incubated with plant extract for 48 h, followed by fixing using 1% paraformaldehyde and counting through a hemocytometer at 22\u00b0C. Miltefosine, a known antileishmanial drug, Briefly, 2 \u00d7 10 6 THP-1 monocytes were seeded in a 96-well tissue culture plate (200 \u03bcL/well) in RPMI 1640 complete media for 24 h in an Eppendorf Galaxy 170S CO 2 incubator (Eppendorf India Pvt. Ltd.) at 37\u00b0C and 5% CO 2 . After the treatment of THP-1-differentiated macrophages, freshly prepared 5 mg/mL of MTT was added (20 \u03bcL/well) with 50 \u03bcL of blank media and further incubated for 2\u22123 h in a CO 2 incubator. Precipitated formazan was dissolved in DMSO; absorbance was recorded at 570 nm in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay plate reader and percent viability was calculated as per the lab's established and published protocol. 44 To determine the effect of A. nilotica on the parasite burden of the host macrophages, 0.5 \u00d7 10 6 THP-1 cells were seeded on the coverslip and placed in the six-well plates in a CO 2 incubator at 37\u00b0C. THP-1 macrophages were plated and infected with L. donovani at the ratio of 1:10 (macrophages to Leishmania) for 48 h. Then, cells were fixed with chilled methanol and parasite counting was performed under the microscope after Giemsa staining. From the different focus, 100 macrophages were counted to determine the parasite burden of the macrophages. Parasite burden in the infection control was considered 100%, with respect to the parasite load in treated samples. ACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article sample were produced in an electron impact ionization mode of 70 eV, and the phytochemicals were identified after the correlation of the recorded mass spectrum with the reference library WILEY8.LIB and NIST14.LIB supplied with the software of the GC\u2212MS system. 4.6. Molecular Docking Studies. To begin with structure-based virtual screening and docking, we used various bioinformatics tools, such as PyRx, 45 AutoDock Vina, 46 PyMOL, 44 and BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2020 pipeline. 47 The online resources used in the retrieval, analysis, and evaluation of the data are the PubChem database and RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB). 48 The target proteins of L. donovani and the phytochemical compounds were uploaded into the virtual screening program PyRx. The target protein was changed into a macromolecule, which converted the atomic coordinates into a pdbqt format. Molecular docking was performed by selecting the grid box around the crystal structures, and the rest of the parameters were left as default. AutoDock Vina was used to predict the binding mode and the best binding affinity of the phytochemicals. The algorithm used by AutoDock Vina is a hybrid scoring function that is inspired by X-score, which accounts for hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic effect, van der Waals forces, and deformation penalty. Besides, for computing, the binding energy AutoDock Vina combines both the conformational preferences of the receptor\u2212ligand complex and experimental affinity measurements. The results of molecular docking were screened for binding affinity, and then, all possible docked conformations were generated for different constituents. After analyzing with PyMOL and Discovery Studio, only those conformations were selected which specifically interact with the active-site residues of L. donovani-targeted proteins. Discovery Studio was used to analyze detailed interactions and their types including hydrogen bonds, alkyl, \u03c0-alkyl, halogen, and the van der Waals interactions formed between different constituents and the target proteins. The most favorable binding poses of the rutin were analyzed by choosing the lowest free energy of binding (\u0394G) and the lowest inhibition constant (K i ) which is calculated using the following formula",

The blastP 49 was performed against Protein Data Bank for the identification of similar templates. The alignment of the query sequences and template sequences was performed using CLUSTAL \u03a9. 50 The crystal structure of TR from Leishmania infantum 2.95 \u00c5 resolution (PDB id: 2JK6_A) and X-ray diffracted crystal structure 1.34 \u00c5 resolution (PDB id: 5WP4_A) were used as template structures to model the 3D structures of TR and SMT, respectively. PDB was used to retrieve the template structure. Homology modeling was carried out using Modeller 9.24, 51 and PyMol was used for the visualization of the 3D structures. The energy minimization was performed using Discovery Studio. The PROCHECK program and Ramachandran plots were also used for the assessment of the model. 23 Crystal structures of the APRT and PTR1 proteins were downloaded from PDB [IDs: 1QB7 (APRT) and 2XOX (PTR1)]. The PDB files used for the docking-based virtual screening study were processed by removing water molecules and adding hydrogen atoms. The proteins were finally prepared by Discovery Studio keeping all the parameters at default. The identification of the critical residues of the binding pockets was taken from the native binding pockets of the available crystal structure of proteins, various submitted literature studies, from their homologous template proteins, and investigation in the mechanism of inhibition. The 3D structure of 9,12-octadecadienoic acid, 6-octadecenoic acid, 13-docosenoic acid, and lupeol was retrieved from the PubChem database in an SDF format.
