The process started with a proteome-wide screening of immunoreactivity based on the use of a high-density microarray followed by a refinement and validation phase on a restricted panel of probes using microarrays with tailored peptide immobilization through a click-based strategy. Progressively larger, independent cohorts of Covid-19 positive sera were tested in the refinement processes, leading to the identification of immunodominant regions on SARS-CoV-2 Spike (S), Nucleocapsid (N) protein and Orf1ab polyprotein. A summary study testing 50 serum samples highlighted an epitope of the N protein (region 155-171) providing 92% sensitivity and 100% specificity of IgG detection in Covid-19 samples thus being a promising candidate for rapid implementation in serological tests.",

While molecular and antigenic testing of respiratory samples are used for the diagnosis of acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, serology testing allows the identification of individuals with recent or past exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Serological tests can be combined with molecular testing to improve the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis 1 and represent key instruments for epidemiological surveillance to guide Public Health interventions 2 . Data from representative and reliable seroprevalence studies will greatly support decision-making practices in terms of physical distancing and other restrictions. However, the use of seroprevalence data to inform policymaking strictly depends on the accuracy and reliability of tests. Yet, currently available serological assays are biased by false-positive and falsenegative results as pointed out by sub-optimal sensitivity and specificity performance (https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/eua-authorized-serology-testperformance).",

Most current immunoassays use recombinant coronavirus proteins: spike (S), which is exposed on the surface of the viral particle, and nucleocapsid (N), which is highly expressed during infection 5 , 3 . Full-length recombinant antigens, however, in addition to high costs and storage constraints, may suffer from stability problems, batch-to-batch variations and in some cases may give rise to cross-reactivity leading to ambiguous detection outcomes. This might be the case for SARS-CoV-2 when using proteins sharing high homology with genetically similar, co-circulating, human coronaviruses (hCoV) that are responsible for common cold 6 , 7 .",

Serum samples were collected from a group of seven COVID-19 patients, aged 68-96 years, at about 30 days after the onset of symptoms. In these patients, who had mild or moderate COVID-19, diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection was confirmed by molecular testing of nasopharyngeal swabs and the presence of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies in corresponding serum samples was demonstrated by virus microneutralization assay. Table 1 reports demographic and clinical data of the COVID-19 patients tested in this study. The whole-proteome peptide microarray screening was performed according to manufacturer instructions after serum samples inactivation at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes (see Methods). Epitope mapping results were analyzed in terms of fluorescence intensity of IgG immune-reactivity of COVID-19 positive sera and discrimination with the healthy control group by the unpaired t test (significative p<0.05).

In these experiments, peptides were in-house synthesized including an azide handle, in order to apply a 'click' chemoselective strategy for peptide binding to polymer-modified microarrays slides (Scheme 1). This strategy was previously shown to allow for fine control of ligand orientation and probe surface density, which correlated with improved assay performances [12] [13] [14] . The initial set of 12 probes was first screened for IgG immunoreactivity against sera collected from a cohort of N =12 COVID-19 patients at about 30 days after symptom onset vs N =12 pre-COVID-19 controls ( Figure 2 ) and their discrimination performance evaluated by the unpaired t test (Table 2 ). Six out of the twelve putative epitopes identified by the initial screening showed ability to discriminate the two sample groups at a statistically relevant level: AM50, AM55 and AM63 from the S protein, AM52 and AM65 form Orf1ab polyprotein and AM57 form the N protein.

Epitope AM57 from the N protein consistently showed a high immunoreactivity, negligible response in healthy controls along all the screenings and the best diagnostic performance (p value <0.0001). We also performed alignment of AM57 sequence against SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and hCoV-OC43 (www.bioinformatics.org), ( Figure 1C ), to assess whether it is conserved among the same virus family.

The discovery process started with a proteome-wide screening on high-density microarray followed by a refinement and validation phase based on low-density arrays characterized by a precise control of orientation and density of peptide probes. The results of the validation screenings showed the crucial role of testing a large number of samples and independent cohorts during a diagnostic probe refinement processes. This is particularly evident when looking at the high variability in immunoreactivity that is observable among the different sera in each set of sample. Our approach led to the identification of immunodominant regions on SARS-CoV-2 Spike, Nucleocapsid protein and Orf1ab polyprotein. A summary study testing 50 Covid-19 serum samples highlighted the optimal diagnostic performance of a N protein linear epitope (region 155-171) which can be considered a promising candidate for rapid implementation in cost-effective serological tests, thus expanding the tool box needed to complement Covid-19 patient assessment, vaccine research and epidemiological studies .",

The study was approved by the ethic committee of IRCCS Sacro Cuore Don Calabria Hospital and study subjects provided written informed consent.Proteome-wide microarray.A PEPperCHIP \u00ae Peptide Microarrays slides with 1 subarray, was used where each peptide sequence is composed by 15 aminoacids with an overlap of 13 residues. Serum samples were incubated dynamically over night at 4\u00b0C, diluted 1:50 in incubation buffer and subsequent protocol steps performed according to manufacturer's instructions. Secondary antibody (Anti-Human IgG-Cy3, Jackson ImmunoReserarch) was used for fluorescence detection and microarrays scanned by TECAN power scanner at 10% laser intensity and 50% gain.Peptides synthesis.All peptides were synthesized by stepwise microwave-assisted Fmoc-SPPS on a Biotage ALSTRA Initiator+ peptide synthesizer according to well-established protocols. Briefly, peptides were assembled on a 2-CTC resin (0.5mmol/g loading) swelled in DCM/NMP 3:1. Chain elongation was performed by iterative cycles of amino acids coupling (using Oxyma/DIC as activators) and Fmoc-deprotection using a 20% piperidine solution in DMF. Coupling steps were performed for 20 minutes at 50\u00b0C. Fmoc-deprotection steps were performed by treatment with 20% piperidine solution at 40\u00b0C for 10 minutes. Following each coupling and deprotection step, peptidyl-resin was washed with DMF. Upon complete chain assembly, peptides were cleaved from the resin using a 2.5% TIS, 2.5% thioanisole, 2.5% water, 92.5% TFA mixture. Crude peptides were then purified by preparative RP-HPLC (Shimadzu). Finally, purified peptides were lyophilized and stored at -20\u00b0C.Peptide microarray.Silicon slides (SVM, Sunnyvail, CA) were coated by MCP6 (Lucidant Polymers) as follows: slides were treated with oxygen plasma for 15 min. MCP6 was dissolved in DI water to final concentration of 2% w/v and then diluted with ammonium sulphate solution 40% at ratio 1:1. Subsequently, silicon slides were immersed into the polymer solution for 30 min, then washed with DI water, dried under nitrogen steam and cured for 15 min under vacuum at 80\u00b0C. Peptides were first dissolved in DMSO to 1 mM stock solution and then diluted to the final spotting concentration of 50\u00b5M in printing buffer composed by 25 mM Na/Acetate pH 4.8, 15 mM trehalose, CuSO 4",
