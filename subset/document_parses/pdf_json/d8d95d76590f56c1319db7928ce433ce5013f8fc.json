Regulatory T cells (Tregs), which are involved in tackling infections under immunosuppressive conditions, are rarely uncovered. We aimed to investigate the relationship between various Treg subpopulations and severe pneumonia after kidney transplantation (KTx). KTx recipients with pneumonia were divided into severe pneumonia and mild pneumonia groups. The frequencies and absolute numbers (Ab No.) of total Tregs (CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + ), six subsets of Tregs (Helios + / -, CD39 +/-, and CD45RA + / -), and T cells, B cells, and NK cells were assessed from peripheral blood via flow cytometry using the t or Mann-Whitney test and receiver operating curve analysis. We also determined the median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of human leukocyte antigen-(HLA-) DR on monocytes and CD64 on neutrophils. Logistic regression was used to identify the risk factors of disease progression, and Pearson's correlation analysis was performed to identify relationships between the measured immune indices and patients' clinical information. Our research indicated that Treg subpopulations were strongly associated with severe pneumonia progression post KTx. Based on the monitoring of Treg subpopulations, betterindividualized prevention and therapy might be achieved for patients with severe pneumonia post KTx.",

Generally, Tregs are categorized as thymus-derived (natural) and peripheral inducible. In the presence of some anti-inflammatory factors, like transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) and interleukin-(IL-) 2, inducible Tregs can be kindled from na\u00efve CD4 + CD25cells upon T cell receptor stimulation [6] . Tregs are usually defined as having a high expression of the \u03b1-subunit of the IL-2 receptor (CD25) and transcription factor FoxP3, as well as a low expression of the IL-7 receptor \u03b1-subunit (CD127) in both mice and humans [7] . Furthermore, the expression of FoxP3 is necessary for Treg development [8] . Tregs play a crucial role in upholding immune homeostasis and providing protection from autoimmune diseases or allograft rejection [9] . Importantly, KTx patients with chronic rejection have a lower level of peripheral CD4 + CD25 + FoxP3 + T cells (total Treg) than operationally tolerant and immune-stable patients [10] . Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia is an opportunistic infection in patients with KTx [11] . Previous studies have shown that in immunocompetent mice with Pneumocystis infection, total Tregs are recruited to the lung, and their loss leads to increased pulmonary injury with high levels of T helper (Th) 2 cells and proinflammatory cytokines [12] . However, there are currently no studies elucidating Treg distribution in KTx patients with pneumonia.",

Furthermore, an increased percentage of FoxP3 + Helios + Treg has been shown to be significantly related to decreased acute graft-versushost disease in allogeneic bone marrow transplant patients [16] . FoxP3 + Helios + Tregs were not only correlated to the improvement of graft-versus-host disease but also influenced the prognosis of bacterial pneumonia.

However, CD39 expression in humans is confined to a subset of FoxP3 regulatory effector/memory-like T (TREM) cells [19] . FoxP3 +-CD39 + Tregs mainly abrogate the inflammasome-mediated induction of proinflammatory responses by hydrolyzing ATP. Recently, several studies demonstrated that there were remarkably decreased numbers of CD39 + Tregs in blood in multiple sclerosis, type 2 diabetes [20, 21] . Compared to wild-type mice, Tregs from CD39-deficient mice could not have enough ability to avert rejection in allogeneic skin grafts [22] . CD39 + Tregs were more stable and functional than CD39 -Tregs. A previous study has been reported that when adoptively transferring CD39 + Tregs to the murine xeno-graft-versus-host model, the survival of mice was longer than that of CD39 -Tregs [23] . Furthermore, increased proportions of circulating CD39 + Tregs were observed to suppress the replica of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis B virus (HBV) [24, 25] .",

However, under stimulation by alloantigen and IL-12, CD45RA + Treg acquired memory phenotypes, antigen-specific potent sup-pressive properties, and conversion to an active phenotype (CD25 + FoxP3 + CD45RA -) [27] . Compared to CD45RA + Tregs, CD45RA -Tregs have robust immunosuppression [28] . Recently, several studies have shown that patients with high levels of CD45RA -Treg have a low rate of transplant rejection [29, 30] . However, elevated CD45RA -Treg may lead to poor prognosis in patients with chronic hepatitis C and HIV infection [31, 32] .

A multivariate logistic analysis was used to show that the BUN (odds ratio \u00f0OR\u00de = 1:24, P = 0:01) and HS (OR = 1:09, P = 0:03) were independent risk factors for disease progression (Table 6 ).

In inflammatory diseases, Tregs are involved in maintaining the immune homeostasis mainly by producing anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10, IL-35, and TGF-\u03b2 [37] . A previous study has demonstrated that long-term use of immunosuppressants increased Tregs in PBMC of patients and mice with organ transplantation [38, 39] . Increased Tregs limited immune activation and prevented the development of graft rejection through secreting anti-inflammatory cytokines and inhibiting the activity of effector T cells [6] . So, patients with high levels of Tregs indicate great graft function and good prognosis. However, in patients with pneumonia, increased Tregs denoted to poor prognosis [40] [41] [42] . In our study, we found that the percentage of total Treg was higher in SP patients than in MP patients after KTx. High levels of Tregs prevented T cells from activation, and the maturation and the ability of antigen-presenting cells to activate effector T cells [6] , which eventually increased the spread of infection and organ damage. The exacerbation of pneumonia ultimately would lead to decreased graft function in KTx patients [3] . In conclusion, monitoring of Tregs is of great significance for the occurrence and prognosis of infection in patients with KTx. The frequency of total Tregs was an independent risk factor for the development of pneumonia after KTx.",

As the infection worsens, graft function and immune function of patients were gradually declined. Meanwhile, the frequency and Ab No. of Helios + Tregs were also decreased. The increased expression of Helios + Tregs indicated a favorable prognosis in pneumococcal infection and graft function [16, 17] . The decreased expression of Helios + Tregs indicated poor graft function and prognosis in KTx patients with pneumonia. Additionally, we found Journal of Immunology Research that the increased frequency of Helios -Tregs was an independent risk factor for the development of pneumonia after KTx. Compared with Helios + Tregs, Helios -Tregs have a reduced suppressive capacity and secrete inflammatory factors [43] . In our research, we demonstrated that the frequency and the Ab No. of Helios -Tregs were higher in SP patients than in MP patients. The increased infiltration of Helios -Tregs could aggravate the progression of pneumonia and poor graft function in patients with KTx. Our study is the first to demonstrate that the frequency and Ab No. of Helios + Tregs are reduced in SP patients after KTx, which was tightly associated with disease progression. CD39 + Tregs demonstrated a stronger suppressive ability than CD39 -Tregs.

A previous study demonstrated that mTregs were more suppressive than rTregs and were crucial for the maintenance of immune homeostasis. Meanwhile, increased mTregs are correlated with better transplant outcomes. Previous studies have demonstrated that reduced CD45RA -Tregs are correlated with both acute and chronic rejection in KTx recipients [30, 46] . Our study demonstrated a low frequency of CD45RA -Treg in SP after KTx, indicating poor pneumonia outcomes. In addition to the clustering method mentioned above, some researchers thought that CD45RA -Treg could be further divided into CD45RA -Helios +/-Treg 9 Journal of Immunology Research and CD45RA -CD39 +/-Treg. We further discussed the association between different CD45RA -Treg subpopulations and the severity of pneumonia post renal transplantation. We found that the percentage and counts of CD45RA -Helios + and CD45RA -CD39 -Tregs in the SP group were significantly lower than those in the MP group. However, the percentage and counts of CD45RA -Heliosand CD45RA -CD39 + Tregs in the SP group were significantly 10 Journal of Immunology Research higher than those in the MP group. Detailed information was presented in supplementary Table 1 and Figure 1 . We also analyzed the correlation between different CD45RA -Treg subpopulations and clinical information (Supplementary Figure 2A) .

However, the percentage and counts of CD45RA -Helios + and CD45RA -CD39 + Tregs were significantly positively correlated with the level of peripheral BUN and Cr. Next, we analyzed the correlation between different Treg subpopulations and regular immune status (Supplementary Figure 2B) . We discovered that the MFI of CD64 on neutrophils was negatively correlated with the percentage and counts of CD45RA -Helios + Treg but positively correlated with the percentage and counts of CD45RA -Helios -Treg. Meanwhile, the counts of NK cells were negatively correlated with the percentage and counts of CD45RA -Helios -Treg, yet positively correlated with the percentage and counts of CD45RA -Helios + Treg. We analyzed the optimal cut-off values by ROC analysis, and the ROC curves were presented in Supplementary Figure 3 . All the indices displayed a high AUC.

In Supplementary Table 3 , the univariate logistic analysis suggested that the percentage and counts of CD45RA -Helios + , CD45RA -Helios -, CD45RA -CD39 + , and CD45RA -CD39 -Tregs were drastically associated with disease progression.

For example, NK cell counts are positively correlated with Helios + Tregs in transplant patients [47] . Furthermore, growing evidence [48] . Tregs can also suppress conventional T cells and B cells through cytokine secretion and cell-cell contact [49] . In our study, a close correlation was observed between different Treg subpopulations and regular immune cells. The MFI of HLA-DR on monocytes, and CD64 on neutrophils, is a common index to measure the infection of patients. As previous studies demonstrated that the expression of HLA-DR reflected the antigen presentation capacity of monocytes, low expression of HLA-DR indicates a poor prognosis in some infectious diseases like sepsis and virus B hepatitis [50, 51] . In our research, we found that the MFI of HLA-DR on monocytes was higher in the MP group. Our results were consistent with previous studies. Low expression of HLA-DR in monocytes symbolizes the poor prognosis of pneumonia after transplantation. In resting neutrophils, the levels of CD64 are very low. However, it is significantly increased in response to the infection in a very short time [52] . In our study, we found that high expression of CD64 had significantly negative correlation with part of Tregs which play an anti-inflammatory role in pneumonia. High CD64 expression means poor prognosis in infected patients, and this view has also been confirmed in our study.",

In our previous study, profiles of B cell and T cell subsets were detailed in immune-stable renal allograft recipients [34, 53] . Moreover, we applied machine learning models to determine the connection between immune monitoring and pneumonia in KTx patients, which can contribute to better-individualized therapy [4] . In this previous study, nonetheless, only a regular immune status panel (including TBNK panel, as well as HLA-DR, CD64) was used, and we paid more attention to the comparison between pneumonia and noninfected allograft renal recipients. In our current study, we mainly investigated the association between Treg subsets and the severity of pneumonia patients post kidney transplantation. Compared to the regular immune status panel, Treg subpopulations were also very important for the diagnosis and prognosis of pneumonia patients post kidney transplantation.",

And the protocol and flow strategy were all solid and fixed by Beckman Coulter. Every center using this commercial panel will do the same steps, not only the experimental protocol but the analyzing flow. For example, Holl et al. used this Treg panel to examine the tumor cellular immunome in cancer patients [54] . Therefore, this panel was designed to uniform the steps among different centers. Of course, in transplantation centers, this panel needs to be broadly applied. We will work to promote the One Study program in transplantation centers. Additionally, it is correct to figure out the association between Treg subsets and infection post KTx was very important and useful for subsequent tolerance induction.",

The morbidity of pneumonia after transplantation is not high because of the gradual improvement of our diagnostic and therapeutic level, so our center collected only 40 valid samples in two years. Our study merely had a comparatively minor number of samples from a single center, which may have contributed to the bias of the data analysis. Meanwhile, our study failed to demonstrate the predicted efficacy for prognosis. Therefore, future large-scale, multicenter, controlled clinical studies are required to fully identify the mechanisms of Treg subpopulations in transplant infection and immunity. Secondly, due to the limitation of detection conditions, we failed to obtain the types of patient's pathogenic bacteria. Whether the distribution of different subpopulations of Tregs is affected by the types of pathogenic bacteria still needs further investigation. Thirdly, patients usually come to see a doctor after showing symptoms of pneumonia. Therefore, we did not get data on the patients' transplanted renal function prior to the onset of infection. We will timely supplement the research on this part in the future.",
