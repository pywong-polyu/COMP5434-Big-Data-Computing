A total of 11 CARDS patients were included in the present study. Data on compartmental immunophenotyping on four patients recruited during the first wave have previously been reported elsewhere 2 . Furthermore, four non-COVID-19 patients with moderate-tosevere ARDS and 15 healthy controls from a previous study were included for comparison 8 . Since all patients were incompetent, informed consent was obtained from next of kin, and the BAL procedure was performed within less than 72 h of mechanical ventilation. The BAL procedure was performed as previously described 2 . Three successive 50-ml aliquots of isotonic saline were instilled in the medial segment of the right middle lobe and aspirated with low negative suction pressure (< 100 cm H 2 O). Pooled BAL fluid was spun and the acellular supernatant frozen at \u2212 80 \u00b0C. DPPC in BALF was measured by a fast point-of care (POC) method able to give answers within 12 min 9 . In brief, the analysis of thawed acellular BALF (130 ul) was performed by dry transmission Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) Spectroscopy. Spectra were obtained by a Sime Diagnostics Alpha + (London, UK) device equipped with a Perkin Elmer SP-2 spectrometer (20 scans; resolution: 4 cm \u22121 ; aperture: 10 mm). Lamellar bodies were spun down at 4000\u00d7g and the precipitate was transferred to a CaF 2 disk, dried, and a spectrum was obtained from which the concentration of DPPC was derived by an algorithm.",

The spectral matrices were decomposed into two principal components (PCs) by applying singular value decomposition, resulting in a score plot of the first and second PC. Each PC is a linear combination of the wavenumbers of spectra. Before applying PCA, the spectra were baseline corrected (Whittaker smoother) and subsequently normalized by applying standard normal variate methods to avoid intensity variations in the spectra due to the deposition. Two parameters, lambda (\u03bb = 10 5 ) and penalty (P = 10 -3 ) are involved related to the smoothness of the fit and the penalty imposed to the points giving positive residuals in the fit. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Even though previous studies on the use of exogenous surfactant in non-COVID ARDS were unsuccessful, there are several specific considerations supporting its use in COVID-19, i.e. impairment of production and/or reabsorption of surfactant due to ATII cell lysis or apoptosis, altered gene expression patterns with evidence for downregulation of surfactant proteins 10 or a combination of several factors. It has been speculated that increased alveolar surface tension due to loss of surfactant may predispose to pulmonary barotrauma, and our findings thus provide a potential mechanism of the higher incidence of subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, and pneumomediastinum in mechanically ventilated CARDS patients (~ 17%) compared to non-COVID ARDS (~ 5-11%) 11 . Furthermore, case series of CARDS patients have reported improvement in oxygenation and lung compliance following exogenous surfactant although repeated doses are probably needed given that ATII cell destruction may predominate in CARDS. Taken together, administration of surfactant in CARDS awaits further justification in large clinical trials.",
