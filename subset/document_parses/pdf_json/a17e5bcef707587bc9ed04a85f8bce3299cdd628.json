The biggest cluster of cases occurred in Lombardy, the most populous Italian region, and elderly men were the population hit in the hardest way. Besides its high infectivity, COVID-19 causes a severe cytokine storm and old people, especially those with comorbidities, appear to be the most vulnerable, presumably in connection to inflammaging. In centenarians inflammaging is much lower than predicted by their chronological age and females, presenting survival advantage in almost all centenarian populations, outnumber males, a phenomenon particularly evident in Northern Italy. Within this scenario, we wondered if: a) the COVID-19 mortality in centenarians was lower than that in people aged between 50 and 80 and b) the mortality from COVID-19 in nonagenarians and centenarians highlighted gender differences. We checked COVID-19-related vulnerability/mortality at the peak of infection (March 2020), using data on total deaths (i.e. not only confirmed COVID-19 cases). Our conclusion is that excess mortality increases steadily up to very old ages and at the same time men older than 90 years become relatively more resilient than age-matched females.",

            "text": "Italy was the first European country to suffer from the COVID-19 pandemic. A main characteristic of this pandemic, besides high infectivity of its causative agent, is a cytokine storm characterized by an IL-6 centered response [1, 2] and the uneven distribution of severity and mortality among different age classes. Indeed, old people, and particularly those with one or more comorbidity, appear to be the most vulnerable [3, 4] . The reasons of such a high vulnerability to COVID-19 is poorly understood but it has been suggested that a major role is played by inflammaging [5] [6] [7] , i.e. the low-grade chronic inflammation that is a major driver of aging [8] and whose basic underlying mechanisms are shared with those responsible for frailty and age-related diseases (ARDs), including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic kidney disease and dementia, among others [9] [10] [11] . However, a major AGING characteristic of old people is their heterogeneity regarding not only their health status (presence/absence of comorbidities, frailty, cognitive status) but also, in particular, their different capability to mount an immune response to pathogens and vaccines [12, 13] . At present it is possible to quantify such heterogeneity using a variety of proteomic [15] and epigenetic biomarkers [16] capable of distinguishing between chronological and biological age, and to predict the risk of developing major ARDs. In particular, we showed that centenarians, i.e. subjects who avoided or largely postponed all major ARDs, and their offspring, are characterized by being healthier than age-matched controls born from non-long-living parents, i.e. a slower aging and are biologically younger than their chronological age of about 9 and 5 years, respectively. Particularly important within the scenario of COVID-19 pandemic is that centenarians have a peculiar state/degree of inflammaging, which is much lower than that predicted by their chronological age and is biased toward anti-inflammaging, i.e. the production of antiinflammatory molecules and cells that the body produces lifelong as an adaptive, compensatory mechanisms to continuously down-regulate the inflammatory process and avoid its chronic detrimental effects [18] [19] [20] . Accordingly, the oldest old, including centenarians, are high-selected, exceptionally robust subjects that can be taken as a model of successful/healthy aging [21] .",

In particular, centenarian females outnumber males [22] , and this demographic phenomenon is particularly evident in Northern Italy, including Lombardy [23] . However, although women live longer, they suffer greater morbidity, particularly late in life. In Trieste, a city situated in the North-East of Italy with 204,000 inhabitants, the prevalence of centenarians is high: in mid-June 2020 there were 148 centenarians, number obtained from the list of the public health service considering only subjects who have reached 100 years of age. In 2014 we started the Centenari a Trieste (CaT) Study, to examine the centenarians living in Trieste. From 2014 to January 2020 we enrolled, visited and collected data of 130 centenarians, using the annual lists provided by the public health service mentioned above. 90% of our centenarian population are women, but the few males are all in excellent health [24] . The complex reasons of such a female longevity advantage/paradox is still unclear [25, 26] but it is likely the result of a mixture of biological (e.g. genetics) and non-biological (e.g. cultural, anthropological) factors [27, 28] .",

Men contributed more to this increase with 9021 (57.0%) extra deaths. Increase in mortality is apparent in older age groups. In fact, while excess mortality under 40 years of age totalized less than 50 persons, its maximum was reached in the 80-84 and 85-89 age categories, with about 3300 more deaths each (Supplementary Figure 1) . When percent excess death by age class was plotted, a continuous increase in mortality by age was apparent ( Figure 1 , panel A). This phenomenon was clearly visible in both men ( Figure 1 , panel B) and in women ( Figure 1 , panel C), where March 2020 mortality is compared with mean March mortality of the previous years. However, the two patterns had also some differences: in women the increase resulted in approximately a doubling in mortality risk in each age class, whereas in men the greatest relative increase was in \"younger\" ages, were 2020 mortality was more than three times that of previous years, while in later ages the increase is about 80%. These different changes result in two different patterns of increase by age, i.e. women increase in excess mortality was lower in \"younger\" AGING ages, but reached that of men in later ages ( Figure 1 , panel D): while excess mortality under 90 was much higher in men, it was similar in the nonagenarians and in centenarians women even had a higher mortality.",

On the whole, nonagenarians and centenarians, despite their capability to survive until an extreme age and to avoid/postpone most of the ARDs, could be highly vulnerable during personal and societal stressful events like as seen during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. These data are in accord with the hypothesis that a major reason of such increasing vulnerability of the elderly, including nonagenarians and centenarians, to COVID-19 infection and related stressful conditions is inflammaging, the agerelated increase of the inflammatory status which is particularly deleterious in those old subjects affected by one or more comorbidities. Inflammaging is a complex phenomenon at present only partially understood which can be highly different and personalized in different individuals [29] . Accordingly, the conceptual framework of inflammaging could help in understanding both the higher vulnerability of the elderly to COVID-19 but also the different responsiveness to COVID-19 infection and related contextual stressors in different subsets of elderly people.",

Men have also a stronger inflammatory state in circulating monocytes compared to women [31] . Thus, men-specific immune characteristics interacting with/related to inflammaging, such as a blunted acquired immune system and type I interferon response, coupled with the downregulation of ACE2 (SARS-CoV-2 receptor) (particularly in patients with agerelated comorbid diseases such as type II diabetes) and an accelerated biological aging (measured by epigenetic markers and telomere shortening), could help in explaining the higher vulnerability of men to COVID-19 infection [32] .",

The more years of life expectancy of women are mostly years of disease and disability [27, 28] . In any case, nonagenarians and centenarians are a mix of those aging well and those aging poorly, and in this heterogeneous scenario men capable of reaching age 90 and especially 100 are likely the more robust.

As an example, our data on a low number of very well characterized subjects of the CaT Study, suggest that both centenarian women and men looked strong during the peak of COVID-19 pandemic which profoundly challenged the entire health system and care of the elderly. What can be observed and reported at a higher magnification and higher granularity in single cities, institutions and settings is the consequence of the basic heterogeneity of the aging phenotype which is particularly evident at the extreme ages and suggests that outcomes may differ by robustness or other characteristics of the individual and are always highly diverse and context-dependent. To this regard, it can be predicted that the use of proteomic [15] , epigenetic [16, 17] and glycomic biomarkers [35] , among others, capable of distinguishing between chronological and biological age, will help in disentangling the heterogeneity of the aging phenotypes and in identifying the elderly characterized by an accelerated aging and lower robustness and thus at higher risk of morbidity and mortality in normal as well in exceptional circumstances such the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Analyzing only confirmed COVID-19 deaths is more specific but, due to the impressive surge in mortality, only a part of those who died due to the infection were reported as being infected, and only a part of them was subject to a verification. Also, in absence of clear typical manifestations, a part of AGING COVID-19 mortality could be incorrectly attributed to other causes, even after a closer reanalysis, since swabs were only partially available, and their sensitivity is far from perfect.",

The remarkable difference between women and men in life expectancy, disability, mortality and longevity which emerged also in circumstances such as the COVID-19 pandemic is complex but still poorly understood and deserves attention and a closer scrutiny. Preventive strategies focused on the elderly preparing us better for the next pandemic are urgently needed [6] .",
