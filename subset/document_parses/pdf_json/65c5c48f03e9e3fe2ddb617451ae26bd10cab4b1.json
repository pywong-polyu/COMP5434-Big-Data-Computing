We highlight the conceptual ideas and mathematical tools needed for such infectious disease modeling. We compute the basic reproduction number of the proposed model and investigate the qualitative behaviours of the infectious disease model such as, local and global stability of equilibria for the non-delayed as well as delayed system. At the end, we perform numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the derived results. (A. Debbouche). of the respective country. Thus, one can conclude that these infectious diseases are a major threat to the society. In past years, mathematical modeling of infectious diseases has been the major topic of interest for researchers to capture their dynamics. The possible causes for the spread of an epidemic can be accurately predicted using mathematical modeling. In earlier mathematical models, only those factors were used to be considered that were closely related to disease, such as infectious period, mode of transmission, susceptibility, etc. But with time, the growth of epidemiology has made it mandatory to consider other factors too, such as economic, geographic and demographic conditions, which play a significant role in the transmission of these diseases. Thus, it becomes necessary to make the mathematical model more realistic by incorporating more parameters and variables. Various mathematical models have been proposed to analyze the dynamics of diseases considering above-mentioned factors. For more details on the various mathematical models proposed in literature, we refer to [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] and the references cited therein. These infectious diseases can be subdivided into various classes, such as vector-borne disease, waterhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.chaos.2021.110707 0960-0779/",

Various researchers and scientists from different fields are working on rapid assessment of such potentially urgent situations. To achieve this, mathematical modeling plays a significant role focussing on prediction, assess and development of control strategies of potential outbreaks. For better understanding and modeling of the contagious dynamics such as Nipah virus infection (NiV), SARS, COVID,..., etc., the impact of various variables, such as interaction terms along with prevailing social, ecological and demographic factors need to be analyzed. Due to these infectious diseases, many countries in this world encounter death and ailments. Besides this, it affects the economic and social structure borne diseases, zoonotic disease,..., etc. Among these, zoonotic diseases are very unique, as they are mainly caused by pathogens (such as fungi, bacteria, parasites, or viruses) and they have the capability to jump from animals to humans or vice versa. Moreover, these diseases can cause sickness or death in people. Thus these are more troublesome and deadly in particular. Recently, many zoonotic diseases have emerged out due to increase in human and wildlife interaction. With increase in farming or deforestation, humans and wildlife are compelled to reside in the same habitat. Due to this, the infected hosts transmit the disease to humans who come in contact with the infected animal through different modes. These modes include bites, scratches, animal secretion that includes saliva, faeces or mucus. This family of zoonotic diseases includes West Nile, Rabies, Ebola, Dengue fever.",

The evolution and spread of SARS resulted in an international effort coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO). Due to the rapid increase in infection, complete data was collected and various kinds of research had been carried out. A new corona virus had been isolated from patients with SARS, and the sequence of the complete genome of SARS-CoV was determined [17, 18] . To bring SARS under control, various measures and actions were taken [19] . Newspapers, radio, TV stations, and posters campaigned to educate and make the public aware of SARS prevention. In many public places, including streets, shopping centers, airports, railways, bus terminals, classrooms, offices, transportation vehicles, and residential areas, disinfectant was sprayed. Individuals who have had direct or indirect contact with probable SARS-infected cases were quarantined in their homes, hospitals, or campuses. Stern travel advisories were issued to students and workers. A body temperature check was done for all air passengers and passengers who failed a therm-imaging check at the entrance were checked by nurses and doctors at the station's quarantine center. Many stock exchanges, cinemas, theaters, and internet cafes were closed temporarily. Quarantine outpatient departments were set up for fever patients in many large hospitals. Special hospitals for SARS treatment were specified in every large city.",

            "text": "In 2018, one of these zoonotic diseases, Nipah virus (NiV) emerged out as a prime suspect, a member of the Henipavirus genus in the Paramyxoviridae family with subfamily Paramyxovirinae. The natural host of the virus was fruit bats of the Pteropodidae Family, Pteropus genus. This virus had become a major concern in South-East Asia. Human NiV infection was first identified during an outbreak of disease, that took place in Kampung Sungai Nipah, Malaysia and Singapore from September 1998 to June 1999, in which 276 cases were reported. During this occasion, pigs were the intermediate hosts. However, in subsequent NiV outbreaks, there were no intermediate hosts. The human outbreak of Nipah infection terminated after widespread deployment of personal protective equipment to people contacting infected or sick pigs and hindering livestock movements and culling over 9,0 0,0 0 0 pigs [20] . In Bangladesh (2004), humans became infected with NiV due to consumption of date palm sap that had been contaminated by infected fruit bats. Human-to-human transmission has also been documented, including in a hospital setting in India. During the 1998 outbreak, about 40 percent of patients with encephalitis subsequently died. Very recently, the outbreak was reported in Kerala (India), in which 17 people died of those it infected. A total of 18 confirmed cases had been reported [21] . NiV infection in humans can be clinically represented in a wide range, from asymptomatic infection to acute respiratory syndrome and fatal encephalitis. NiV is also capable of causing disease in pigs and other domestic animals. There is no vaccine for either humans or animals. There is a vast literature discussing the NiV spread, causes, symptoms etc. For instance, we refer to [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] and references cited therein. Consequently, it becomes mandatory to respond urgently to this in order to combat against NiV infection effectively.",

            "text": "Very recently, the Novel 2019 Corona virus, SARS-CoV-2 (COVID- 19) , emerged towards the end of 2019 in Wuhan city in the Peoples Republic of China, and it has spread to the entire world very fast and in a very short time. With the respiratory tract infection that it causes, the virus leads to pneumonia characterized by an appearance like frosted glass. This infection has progressed in a highly destructive manner in the whole world. Various preventive measures have been taken by countries to control this pandemic, such as complete lock down and effort s similar to taken during spread of SARS in 2003. Due to these reasons, the prevention of infectious diseases become one of the most important tasks in public health. To tackle these issues of infectious diseases successfully, it becomes mandatory to establish a supporting system of executing preventive measures sharing know-how of prevention from infectious diseases. Among such preventive measures, mathematical modelling of such disease models and their analysis plays a very important role to achieve these missions. In literature, various mathematical models have been proposed for the SARS-COV-2 model. In [31] , Zhang et. al. investigated a delayed virus model with two different transmission methods and treatments. For more details on the mathematical models for 2019-nCoV, we refer to [32, 33] and the references cited therein. Motivated by the above discussions, this work aims to provide a mathematical model for the infectious disease model and its qualitative analysis for the corresponding non-delayed and delayed model to explore the dynamics of the infections and reduce the spread and prevent the possible occurrence of such infections.",
