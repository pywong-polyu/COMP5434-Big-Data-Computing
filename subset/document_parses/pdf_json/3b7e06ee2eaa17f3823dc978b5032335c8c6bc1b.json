Rather it argues why molecular epidemiology should not be conceived without an extensive use of the concepts of population genetics and evolutionary biology. Moreover, it stresses that characterizing pathogens should open up to evaluating the impact of pathogens' genetic diversity on their relevant medical properties (downstream studies). Lastly, it presents the foreseeable future developments in this field, which has been upset by the exponential development of megatechnologies (massive sequencing, postgenomic studies, and bioinformatics).

Actually, the premises of this burst onto the front stage were already apparent years ago. The field is at the crossroads of two major lines in modern biomedical research: the exponential development of molecular technologies and the preoccupying wave of emerging and reemerging infectious diseases (\"The golden age of genetics and the dark age of infectious diseases\" Tibayrenc 2001) . As for the threat of infectious diseases, it is worth noting that the alarms sounded these last few years (SARS, avian flu) have not, in the end, been confirmed as major pandemics. Still, the fact remains that transmissible diseases remain by far the major killers of the human species on a worldwide basis. It can also be said that they more than ever constitute the major selection pressure of humankind (Haldane 1949) , since many of them kill at the age of reproduction, or before it. Even when considering industrial countries, much more than 40 years ago, today infectious diseases are a major concern with the problems of AIDS, nosocomial infections, antibiotic resistance and multidrug-resistant pathogens. Obviously, considering that transmissible diseases are under control would be quite unrealistic. Can it be considered therefore that molecular epidemiology is a major contribution toward reaching this goal? The answer to this question is the very topic of this book, and more specifically, of the present chapter. The goal is neither to draw a comprehensive review of everything known in this field, nor to provide the reader with a handbook of molecular epidemiology. It is rather to give my personal views on how molecular epidemiology should be conceived today and the future avenues this field may take.",

The method is also very clear: the use of all techniques offered by biochemistry and molecular biology toward reaching this goal. In itself, this definition is quite satisfactory. The goal of molecular epidemiology is to help elucidate the routes traveled by epidemics by tracking the relevant units of analysis, the entities that are responsible for the epidemics.

They have also been widely used for parasitic protozoa strain identification (Godfrey and Kilgour 1976) . However, MLEE* has many drawbacks that definitely make it an outdated technology: (i) it is a time-consuming and delicate technique, (ii) it lacks resolution when the microevolutionary scale is considered, (iii) it is subject to homoplasy*, although this drawback has been exaggerated, (iv) and lastly, it requires bulk strain culturing, which leads to culturing bias* (see below).",

The main advantage of microsatellites* is their high resolution. MLST* has the advantage of its high standardization and perfect portability. In terms of resolution power, MLST* is not at the top: it is often surpassed by mere restriction fragment length polymorphism* (RFLP) of antigen genes. Lastly, thanks to the recent progress in automatic sequencing, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of many strains in bacterial species tends to become routinely accessible, and makes it possible to design many SNP (single nucleotide polymorphisms) to type strains of pathogens (Pearson et al. 2009 ) It should be stressed that in and of themselves, these techniques are mere labeling tools and say nothing about the biological and evolutionary properties of the organisms they aim to characterize (see below).",

Strictly speaking, if we take the basic definition given by the CDC (1994), routine serological tests can be considered molecular epidemiologic tools. The same holds true for PCR* identification of pathogen species. If we limit ourselves to these very basic tools, there is no doubt that molecular epidemiology has made a considerable contribution to routine medical practice. However, when a more common meaning is considered (that is to say, high-resolution identification of strains and clones), molecular epidemiology has not entered the routine daily practice of medical doctors (Humphreys 2004) . It should instead be considered an epidemiological research tool. Still, the fact remains that it is not confined to basic research. It does help health professionals make practical decisions. The survey and control of the H5N1 epidemics, for example, would not have been possible without the contribution of molecular epidemiology.",

Recombination tests (linkage disequilibrium* analysis, Tibayrenc et al. 1990; Maynard Smith et al. 1993 ) avoid this shortcoming and are applicable whatever the ploidy of the organism may be, even if it is unknown, or if the molecular profiles make it impossible to identify individual alleles .

The first refers to those species in which occasional bursts of genetic clones soon vanish in the common gene pool of a recombining species. Neisseria meningitidis is an example of this. Clonal evolution concerns those species in which clones remain stable at an evolutionary scale. Trypanosoma cruzi and Salmonella sp. are examples of this.

To define species with this approach, as many characters as possible are taken into account without prioritizing them (Sneath and Sokal 1973) . This concept could be useful to define pathogen species, although this approach is time-consuming. 3. The phenotypic concept is still widely used to define new species in insects, mammals, etc. In such cases, it is mainly based on morphological characters (color, shape, etc.). In microbiology, it can be said that many microbe species have been defined on phenotypic characteristics, either epidemiological traits or pathological properties. For example, Mycobacterium leprae is the causative agent of leprosy. Leishmania infantum is the agent of leishmaniosis in infants. Leishmania panamensis was first described in Panama.

Whatever the pathogen under survey -parasite, fungus, bacterium, virus, prion, be it of medical, veterinary or agronomical relevance -species, strains, clones, and genes of interest should be reliably identified using evolutionary concepts. The genetic variability of the pathogen considered should be taken into account for vaccine/drug design, epidemiological follow-up and clinical studies. Yet the world of pathogens is too heterogeneous for building totally standardized approaches. Species concepts are not the same for parasites, bacteria, and viruses. What's more, the molecular tools cannot be the same.",

On the other hand, until now, specialists of Chagas disease have agreed on considering Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, a unique, although genetically extremely heterogeneous, species (Zingales et al. 2009 ).

Pathogen profiling will be even more valuable if it relies on the survey of pathogen's whole genomes, which becomes now more and more accessible, at least for viruses and bacteria (Pearson et al. 2009 ).

Such a holistic approach (integrated genetic epidemiology of infectious diseases) should be extended to the entire genome of hosts, pathogens and vector (population genomics).

Cladistic analysis a specific approach of phylogenetic analysis based on the polarization of characters that are shared between ancestral (plesiomorphic) and derived (apomorphic) characteristics. Only those apomorphic characters shared by all members of a given clade* (synapomorphic character) are considered to convey relevant phylogenetic information (Hennig 1966) . Culturing bias This term refers to the situation where a host is infected by several different genotypes of a given pathogen. When culturing an isolate of this pathogen, some genotypes will tend to dominate to the detriment of others. At the end of the culturing process, the collection of genotypes does not reflect the original isolate (Tibayrenc 1995) . Homogamy preferential mating between individuals that are genetically identical or extremely similar to each other. Homoplasy Common possession by distinct evolutionary units of identical characters that do not originate from a common ancestor. The origin of homoplastic traits include the following: (a) convergence (possession of identical characters derived from different ancestral characters, due to convergent evolutionary pressure, for example, the fins of fish and dolphins); (b) parallelism (possession of identical characters derived from a single ancestral character and generated independently in different evolutionary units); and (c) reversion (restoration of an ancestral character from a derived character).",

            "text": "Isoenzymes Protein extracts of the biological samples under analysis are separated by electrophoresis. The gel is then processed with a histochemical reaction involving the specific substrate of a given enzyme. This enzyme's zone of activity is then specifically stained on the gel. From one sample to another, migration differences can be visible for this same enzyme. These different electrophoretic forms of a given enzyme are referred to as isoenzymes or isozymes. When given isoenzymes are driven by different alleles of a single gene, they are more specifically referred to as alloenzymes or allozymes. Differences in migration result from different overall electrical charges between isoenzymes. Overall electric charges are a resultant of the individual electric charges of each amino acid (AA) of a given enzyme. The AA sequence is the direct result of the DNA sequence of the gene that codes for this enzyme. It is therefore considered (and verified) that isoenzyme polymorphism is a faithful reflection of the genetic polymorphism of the organism under study. Linkage disequilibrium Nonrandom association of genotypes occurring at different loci. Microsatellite A short DNA sequence of DNA, usually 1-4 bp long, that is repeated together in a row along the DNA molecule. Microsatellites are fast-evolving markers, with a high resolution level and are found in many organisms, including pathogens. Molecular clock In its strict, original sense (more correctly called the DNA clock hypothesis), the concept that the rate of nucleotide substitutions in DNA remains constant over time. In a broader sense, simply how fast the genomic part that codes for the variability of the marker considered evolves. This speed is driven by the mutation rate. It may be regular or irregular. Monophyletic an evolutionary line that has a unique ancestor. Multilocus sequence typing (Maiden et al. 1998 ) is a highly standardized approach based on the sequencing of 450-bp parts of a set of housekeeping genes (usually seven). It has been widely used for a high number of bacterial species and some eukaryotic pathogens as well. The main advantage of MLST is it perfect portability (possibility of reliably communicating results among different laboratories), since sequences can be simply emailed. Strains that share the same combination of alleles are referred to as sequence types (ST). Strains that share 7/7 alleles = consensus group; strains that share 6/7 alleles = single-locus variants (SLV); strains that share 5/7 alleles are double-locus variants (DLV). SLV and DLV = clonal complexes. Panmixia panmictic: Situation in which genetic exchanges occur randomly in the population under survey. Parthenogenesis Reproduction by the development of a single gamete without fertilization by a gamete of the opposite sex. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) A technique that copies the complementary strands of a target DNA chain through a set of cycles until the needed DNA amount is produced. PCR uses synthesized primers* whose nucleotide sequences are complementary to the DNA flanking the target region. The DNA is heated to separate the complementary strands, then cooled to have the primers bind to the flanking sequences. The enzyme Taq DNA polymerase is added and the reaction is left to pass through the required number of replication cycles. Primer a short DNA sequence used in PCR* technologies, that anneals to a single strand of DNA and acts as a starting point to initiate DNA polymerization mediated by the enzyme Taq DNA polymerase. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) variability in the DNA of a given organism evidenced by the use of restriction endonuclease bacterial enzymes. The endonuclease cuts the DNA at a specific restriction site with a given sequence, and the polymorphism of the DNA fragments thus obtained can be visualized on gels, either directly by ethidium bromide staining or by Southern blot hybridization with specific probes. Self-fertilization fertilization by the union of male and female gametes from the same individual",
