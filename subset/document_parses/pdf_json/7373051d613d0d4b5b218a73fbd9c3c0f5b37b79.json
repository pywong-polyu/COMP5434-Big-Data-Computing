They look after family member(s) (e.g., parents, siblings and grandparents) or a significant other such as a friend/schoolmate or neighbor. The person(s) they care for may suffer from a disability (e.g., physical disabilities caused by injury or illness), chronic physical (e.g., diabetes, asthma and cancer) and/or mental (e.g., depression, anxiety and schizophrenia) illness or substance use issue, neurodevelopmental (e.g., autism and intellectual disability) or neurological (e.g., dementia, stroke and epilepsy) disorders and/or frailty due to ageing, who require care, support and/or supervision [1, 2] . It is estimated that in Europe, around 4-8% of children and young people aged between 10 and 24 years carry out substantial care for a family member or significant other [3] .",

            "text": "Taking on care responsibilities early in life may have considerable negative consequences for young people's mental and physical health and psychosocial development [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Caring has especially been linked to stress, anxiety and depression symptoms when occurring in the adolescent phase [10, 11] , which is remarkable given evidence that most mental health problems that start during adolescence subsequently persist into adulthood [12] . Risk factors that have been reported to affect physical and mental health outcomes of adolescent YCs (AYCs) include being female or non-binary and having a migration background [8, 13] , living with care recipients [8] , the extent (i.e., greater amount of time) [13] [14] [15] and nature (i.e., personal and emotional care, financial and practical management) [7, 14] of caring activities and food insecurity [16, 17] . AYCs are also likely to face difficulties in education that negatively impact future employability, career aspirations and socioeconomic status [5, [18] [19] [20] . Among risk factors for educational outcomes, more hours of care provided and caring for someone with a mental illness or using alcohol/drugs have been associated with lower emotional engagement (i.e., positive attitudes to teachers, classmates, schoolwork and the school environment) and greater problems with school in terms of both attendance and performance [21] [22] [23] . Furthermore, AYCs often report stigma leading to social isolation, bullying and victimization, which constitutes a risk factor for school absenteeism [24, 25] . Altogether, caring responsibilities in the adolescent phase may have a serious impact on psychosocial adjustment and represent a challenge to life planning in relation to education, career and personal life [9, 26] . However, self-efficacy beliefs, perceived social support, opportunities for leisure/recreation and meaningful social interactions and emotional engagement with school may act as protective factors, as they have been linked to better adjustment to the caring role, physical and psychosocial well-being and educational achievement [7, 14, 27, 28] . Furthermore, resilience and a positive sense of self-identity have been suggested to promote coping with caring circumstances [29, 30] . Among lifestyle factors, fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity have been associated with better mental health outcomes among adolescents and YCs [31, 32] .",

However, allocation of the 44 participating AYCs to intervention or control groups was not randomized. More recently, a resilience-building program was tested among twelve Australian AYCs aged 12-14 [33] . Besides the small sample size, objective outcome measures, baseline or long-term follow-up assessment were not applied. These studies, while showing promising results, call for rigorous efficacy studies in Europe that involve larger samples, collect both quantitative and qualitative data, and consider both internal (e.g., mental health and well-being) and external (e.g., social support and school performance and attendance) outcomes [6, 33, 41] .",

Definitions of mental health are many and vary [45] . In the context of the ME-WE project, mental health has been conceptualized as a dynamic state of internal equilibrium, which enables individuals to utilize adaptively basic cognitive and emotional skills (such as recognizing, expressing and regulating one's emotions), be flexible and cope with adverse life events and changes, function in social roles and participate in meaningful social interactions and maintain a harmonious relationship between body and mind [46] . An age range of between 15 and 17 years was selected as middle adolescence is often recognized as a critical period of transition into adulthood, in which adolescents deal with the creation and management of their identity and sense of self [47] . This time of intrapsychic changes has been associated with an increased susceptibility to the development of various mental health problems [48] , calling for special attention to this age group.",

            "text": "The ME-WE primary prevention intervention program for AYCs has been developed based on the theoretical framework of the DNA-V model (discoverer, noticer, advisor and values) by Hayes and Ciarrochi [49] . The DNA-V model is an adaptation of the acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) evidence-based approach [50] , which is suitable for working with adolescents to promote their mental health and well-being. This psychoeducational group intervention is used in educational and clinical settings to help adolescents manage difficult emotions, find solutions to everyday problems, connect with their values, achieve mindfulness and vitality and develop positive relationships with friends and family. It focuses on developing a strong sense of self and giving adolescents the confidence that they need to make the transition into adulthood [49] . The model describes three functional classes of behavior, which are referred to using the metaphorical terms of discoverer, noticer and advisor. At the center of the model there are the values that guide behaviors. The discoverer involves behaviors related to exploring and testing the world through trial and error learning. The noticer is a powerful process that allows us to connect with our inner experience and the physical signals coming from the external environment. The advisor metaphorically represents our own \"inner voice\", which is used to make sense of the past, form beliefs, evaluate ourselves and others without the need for trial and error. The discoverer, noticer and advisor provide the means to engage in values-based action. Values are conceptualized as a compass that guides individuals through the difficult moments of life and toward the things that are important to them. The ultimate goal of the DNA-V model is to build psychological flexibility, i.e., \"the ability to utilize DNA skills in a way that promotes growth and builds vitality and valued action\" [49] (p. 10), which is critical to resilience promotion [51, 52] . Specifically, DNA-V promotes resilience by reinforcing adolescents' ability to shift from the advisor's worry and rumination about negative events into noticing and connecting with values in the present moment. DNA-V also helps young people to accept negative emotions as they are and without judgment rather than fighting against and amplifying them. Finally, DNA-V encourages youth to shift into the discoverer's space to find new ways to move beyond adversity [49] .",

Indeed, the educational journey involved in the DNA-V model can assist AYCs in recognizing, accepting and sharing the emotions aroused by their caring experiences, which are often silenced by these youth [53] . Additionally, the DNA-V model has the potential to help AYCs explore and expand their behavioral repertoires to develop new and more effective ways of being in their caring role and in social relationships, to develop a flexible self-view and explore identities and future opportunities [26] .",

The DNA-V protocol has been piloted in cohort studies with clinical and non-clinical adolescents and showed promising results in terms of improved well-being and psychological flexibility [58] [59] [60] . However, its effectiveness has not yet been rigorously tested by means of a randomized controlled trial (RCT). In view of this research gap and the objectives of the ME-WE European project, the aim of this study was to design an international RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of the ME-WE intervention, which is an adaptation of the DNA-V model that accounts for the specificity of the target population of AYCs aged 15-17. Therefore, our primary research question was: Does the ME-WE intervention promote favorable changes in AYCs' mental health and well-being outcomes compared to a control group? As a secondary research question, we aim to establish whether the ME-WE intervention leads to greater improvements in educational or vocational outcomes than a control group. To answer primary and secondary research questions, a number of primary and secondary outcomes, respectively, will be measured and compared between the study arms across the duration of the study (i.e., from baseline through post-intervention and 3 months follow-up). Primary outcomes will be those directly targeted by the ME-WE intervention, including psychological flexibility, mindfulness, resilience, mental and physical health, impact of caring and social support. Secondary outcomes will include self-reported functioning (i.e., experience, performance and attendance) at school/training/work, which are not directly targeted by the ME-WE intervention.",

Cluster randomization is used to minimize contamination between intervention and control arms [61] . Indeed, if randomization were performed at the individual participant level, there would be a risk for exchange of information between AYCs within the same cluster. Clusters will consist of AYCs attending the same school (in Slovenia, Sweden and Switzerland) or living in the same geographical area (i.e., neighborhood or post-code area) (in Italy, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom). Clusters will be randomly assigned to either the ME-WE intervention or the waitlist control (1:1 allocation ratio), so that all eligible participants from the same school or geographical area are in the same study arm. Randomization will be conducted by a research member who is neither involved in the recruitment nor in the intervention delivery, using an online number generator. To achieve a certain degree of blinding, both schools and community-based service organizations (for geographical area clusters) and participating AYCs will be informed that the study aims to investigate the effects of different support strategies on AYCs' well-being. They will not be told which condition they have been allocated to, nor will they be offered detailed information about the respective other trial arm during the study. Outcomes will be measured at the individual level.

Recent metaanalytic evidence supports the equivalence of face-to-face and web-mediated psychological interventions [66, 67] . Both delivery approaches will address the same psychological processes and will use similar exercises and activities. The rationale for adopting two distinct approaches lies in different country characteristics with respect to the use of information and communication technologies. Indeed, recent data indicate that Sweden, Switzerland and the Netherlands rank among the highest in digital skills, with 72-79% of citizens having basic or above basic overall digital skills, while Italy and Slovenia rank among the lowest, with 42-55% [68] . Although United Kingdom ranks above average digital skills (74%), they opted for a face-to-face approach due to their prior experiences of running face-to-face groups in the context of YCs' projects [69] . In the blended approach, sessions 1, 3, 7 and the 3 months follow-up meeting will be performed face-to-face, while sessions 2, 4, 5 and 6 will be performed online using the ME-WE app and the ZOOM platform. In the online sessions, the theoretical DNA-V inputs will be provided through short videos. The activities and exercises have been slightly modified to be easily performed online and remotely by participants, but facilitators will use the same instructions as in the fully face-to-face approach.",

Primary and secondary outcomes and control variables will be collected at baseline (T0), post-intervention (T1) and 3 months post-intervention (T2). T0, T1 and T2 assessments in the ME-WE intervention group will be performed at the beginning of session 1, at the end of session 7 and at the beginning of session 8, respectively. Primary outcome variables will include psychological flexibility, mindfulness skills, resilience, subjective mental and physical health, general and caring-related quality of life, impact of caring and social support. Secondary outcome variables will be self-reported school/training/work experience, performance and attendance. The following variables will be used as control variables: caring activities, overall amount of caring, likes and dislikes of caring, formal support received and caring-related perceived social support. Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected using a questionnaire available in both web-based and paper-and pencil versions. All selected standardized self-report measures were specifically developed and/or tested for use with adolescents. Measures not available in the local languages of participating countries have been translated after permission from the authors. The committee translation method was used [71] . Specifically, in non-English countries, two independent researchers fluent in English independently translated each measure from English into their local language, and then met to discuss eventual discrepancies and reach consensus on an integrated version. English questionnaires were used for participants in the United Kingdom. Ad-hoc developed items were formulated in English and then translated using the same procedure used for standardized tools. Participants in the intervention group will complete a post-intervention self-assessment tool at T1 and T2. Process evaluation outcomes will include feasibility, acceptability and fidelity indicators.",

            "text": "Psychological flexibility will be assessed using the avoidance and fusion questionnaire for youth (AFQ-Y) [72] (8 items, 5-point scale ranging from not at all true to very true). The AFQ-Y has been developed based on the ACT model and validated for use with youth into several languages, including Italian [73] , Dutch [74] and Swedish [75, 76] . All versions showed adequate reliability and concurrent validity with measures of internalizing and externalizing symptoms [72] [73] [74] [75] [76] . Mindfulness skills will be measured with the child and adolescent mindfulness measure (CAMM) [77] (10 items, 5-point scale ranging from never true to always true). The original CAMM has been validated in a large sample of children and adolescents, showing a one-factor structure with adequate internal consistency and associations in the expected directions with a number of criterion measures (e.g., quality of life and internalizing and externalizing problems) [77] . The validated Italian [78] [79] [80] and Dutch [81] versions used in this study demonstrated sound reliability and construct validity. Both the AFQ-Y and CAMM showed sensitivity to change when used with children and adolescents receiving ACT-or mindfulness-based interventions, e.g., [57, [82] [83] [84] [85] . To assess resilience, the brief resilience scale (BRS) [86] (6 items, 5-point scale ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree) will be applied. The original BRS showed evidence of validity and reliability as a one-factor measure of the ability to recover from stress and has already been used in research with AYCs [87] . The Dutch [88] and German [89] adaptations used in this study demonstrated adequate reliability, meaningful associations with mental health symptoms and confirmed the BRS original structure. The Warwick Edinburgh mental wellbeing scale (WEMWBS) [90] (14 items, 5-point scale ranging from none of the time to all of the time) will be used for measuring subjective mental health. The original WEMWBS was developed in the United Kingdom and showed sound psychometric proprieties including internal consistency and evidence of validity based on content, internal structure and relations with other mental health and well-being scales [90] . This widely used measure has been tested for use with adolescents [91] and proved valid and reliable in its Italian [92] , Dutch [93] , Slovenian [94] , Swedish (7-item WEMWBS) [95] and German [96] adaptations. Subjective physical health will be assessed with the health behavior in school-aged children symptom checklist (HBSC-SCL) [97] (8 items, 5-point scale ranging from about every day to rarely or never). The HBSC-SCL has been developed within the HBSC study, a World Health Organization collaborative cross-national study of adolescent health and well-being that includes fifty countries and regions across Europe and North America, including the six countries of the present study [98] . Validation studies on the HBSC-SCL indicate that it measures two dimensions of subjective health complaints (i.e., psychological and somatic) with adequate internal consistency and test-retest reliability, and content, convergent and discriminant validity [99, 100] . For general quality of life, the KIDSCREEN-10 [101] (10 items, 5-point scale ranging from not at all/never to extremely/always) will be employed, with an additional item on subjective general health (5-point scale ranging from excellent to poor) and one multiple-choice ad-hoc question on currently experiencing health-related issues (i.e., mental health problems, physical disabilities, learning difficulties or other). The KIDSCREEN-10 was developed from the 27-item KIDSCREEN to obtain a Rasch-scaled single score of quality of life for children and adolescents. It was validated in a large sample of youth across thirteen European countries, including Italy, Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom, showing adequate reliability and construct and criterion validity [102] . The KIDSCREEN-10 has been adopted in the HBSC study and has been used in research on AYCs [13, 103] . The translations used in this study were taken from [104] . Caring-related quality of life will be assessed using 3 dichotomous (yes/no) ad-hoc questions regarding thoughts about hurting oneself and others, and being bullied, teased or made fun of, and one multiple-choice ad-hoc question on experienced healthrelated issues (i.e., mental health problems, physical health problems or other) because of the caring role. Perceived cognitive and emotional impact of caring will be assessed using the positive and negative outcomes of caring (PANOC) [105] (20 items, 3-point scale ranging from never to a lot of the time). The PANOC was specifically developed for and validated in YCs in the United Kingdom. It consists of two 10-item subscales (positive and negative outcomes) with adequate internal consistency and expected associations with depressive symptoms [105] . A Swedish adaptation has been used in previous studies, showing adequate internal consistency [6] . Finally, perceived social support will be measured using an adapted version of the brief social support questionnaire (SSQ-6) [106] that includes 3 items asking to indicate the number of support sources and one item asking for global satisfaction with received social support (6-point scale ranging from very dissatisfied to very satisfied), and one multiple-choice ad-hoc question on individuals (i.e., school staff, close family members and close friends) AYCs can count on if in need of support or help. The original SSQ-6 validation study indicated a two-factor structure (availability of and satisfaction with social support) with adequate reliability and expected relations with personality dimensions [106] . The Dutch adaptation showed adequate reliability [107] . The SSQ-6 has been previously used with adolescent populations [108] and with AYCs showing good reliability and meaningful associations with indicators of well-being [27, 109] .",

Three multiple-choice ad-hoc questions will assess formal support or services that AYCs and someone in their family receive (i.e., care package, equipment, transportation assistance, benefits and allowances), and whether school staff, other family members and friends have been trusted or know about their caring situation.",

Participants' feedbacks were collected in group discussions with questions related to their satisfaction with intervention overall arrangement, timing and contents, and to individual experiences during session and home activities. Altogether, timing and contents were rated favorably, and intervention activities and exercises were well received among AYCs. Only minor adjustments were proposed, such as the need for introducing physical materials used (e.g., cards) and emphasizing that there are no correct or incorrect interpretations of the stimuli proposed in the session exercises, and more clearly explaining home activities and their voluntary nature. Proposed adjustments were subsequently implemented. In May 2019, the assessment questionnaire was piloted with two groups of AYCs from Italy (n = 4) and the United Kingdom (n = 5) to evaluate comprehensibility, acceptability and completion time. In general, the tool was deemed comprehensive and easy to understand and respond. Mean questionnaire completion time was 20 min.

A minimum group size of 24 AYCs was established based on power analyses with a power of 80% and an \u03b1-error probability of 5%. However, in the case of cluster RCTs, an effective sample size is in fact lower than that suggested by the actual number of participants due to observations on participants in the same cluster tending to be correlated [62] . Thus, initial sample size estimation (performed as if randomization occurred at the individual level) was corrected taking into account randomization occurring at the cluster level. For each country, an average cluster size was estimated using the formula for sample size determination in a finite population [113] and assuming the prevalence rate of AYCs in the population of adolescents aged 15-17 in that country. Based on available data, the estimated prevalence rate of YCs is about 3% in Italy [114], 7% in Sweden [115] , about 8% in Switzerland [3] , 6% in the Netherlands [116] and in the United Kingdom approximately 7% of all children are engaged in a high amount of caring and 3% in a very high amount [117] , while no estimation is available yet for Slovenia. As Italy and Slovenia have both been classified as countries at the initial stage of awareness concerning AYCs [118] , the Italian prevalence rate was also applied in the Slovenian sample size calculation. A design effect was then calculated using the average cluster size and an assumed intracluster correlation of 0.05. This design effect was multiplied by the initial sample size to obtain a sample size corrected for the cluster-based design, which was further increased by 20% to compensate for attrition. The minimum total sample sizes obtained from this procedure were as follows: 80 AYCs ",

To answer primary and secondary research questions, differences in primary and secondary outcomes between the study arms from T0 through T1 and T2 will be tested using linear mixed effect models. These analyses will be based on individual participant-level data, allowing for clustering between AYCs within the same school or geographical area [62, 120] . Models will include the fixed effects of study arm, country and delivery approach, time and their interaction effects. The cluster will be considered as a random effect. Models will be adjusted for characteristics that are unbalanced between study arms and significantly associated with the outcome measures. In case of violations of assumptions underlying planned analyses (e.g., equal variance and normal distribution of residuals) appropriate mathematical transformations of raw scores (e.g., logarithmic scale) or robust estimation methods will be applied [121] . Interpretation of results will be based on both statistical significance (p < 0.05, two-tailed) and measures of effect size [122] .

A primary prevention model has been recommended to mitigate against negative outcomes and foster transitions to adulthood [18, [38] [39] [40] . To the best of our knowledge, this study will be the first RCT evaluating the efficacy of a primary prevention, group-based intervention for middle adolescents who care for a family member or significant other in Europe. Noteworthy, participatory codesign, user-centered principles were followed in the development of the ME-WE intervention. In all participating countries, YCs, former YCs and professionals working in the field of youth and/or caring participated in BLNs aimed to collect expert knowledge for the designing of a support program tailored to AYCs' needs and preferences, with expected favorable effects on participation, adherence and the likelihood of the program success. The components of DNA-V included in the ME-WE intervention promote skills to manage difficult emotions and thoughts, identify values and derive values-oriented goals, develop strengths, build positive social networks and achieve psychological flexibility and mindfulness [49] . The ME-WE intervention has the potential to prevent maladjustment and promote well-being and healthy development in AYCs by building resilience through the skills learnt to be flexible in facing life events, including caring-related ones, and live according to personal values. We anticipate improvements in protective factors targeted by the ME-WE intervention. Specifically, we expect that, compared to the waitlist control group, ME-WE intervention participants will report greater improvements in psychological flexibility, mindfulness, resilience, subjective health and quality of life and in perceived emotional impact of caring and social support, and that these effects will be maintained at the 3 months follow-up. We will also explore potential changes in self-reported school, training or work experience, performance and attendance, which are considered as secondary outcomes because the ME-WE intervention does not address these variables directly. This international RCT has received formal ethical approval and is now being implemented. On completion, results will be reported as outlined in the CONSORT statement [129] and will be published in subsequent peer-reviewed scientific publications, presented at national and international conferences and widely disseminated to professionals, decision makers, policy makers and civil societies at regional, national and international levels. In this article we also detailed the statistical analysis plan to ensure analytical transparency and avoid data-driven analyses [130, 131] .",

Such an intervention could be implemented in educational and clinical settings, and educators together with health and social care professionals will have a new avenue for referral of AYCs available to them. The availability of an app-based version has the advantage of reducing stigma and enhancing anonymity that may prevent adolescents from accessing psychosocial support services and programs [132] . As well, it provides greater flexibility as it is not bound to a physical location. Further, group-based interventions can be more cost-effective than one-to-one interventions, and have the valuable potential to reduce isolation, promote peer-to-peer interactions and create bonds among AYCs, which has been reported as an unmet need of these youth [133] . From a research perspective, the outcomes of this study will contribute to evidence-based practices in primary prevention of psychosocial difficulties in AYCs. Additionally, if the ME-WE intervention is found to have an effect, this study will gather novel knowledge on the effectiveness of the DNA-V model [49] for promoting the mental health and well-being of middle adolescents who care for a family member or significant other.",

            "text": "Our study design has some limitations that must be acknowledged. First, there is the lack of comparison with an evidence-based control intervention. However, an intervention for YCs in the middle adolescent phase has not previously been tested in Europe. Second, a cross-over design would ensure that participants in the waitlist group receive the intervention, besides providing strengthened statistical power. However, our choice of using a parallel group design was based on practical and methodological considerations. A crossover design requires that participants receive one treatment first and then crossover to the other after a washout period; thus, it takes at least twice as long as an independent parallel group design, depending on the duration of the washout period [134] . The ME-WE project consortium deemed that a longer intervention period extended by the washout period was not feasible within the timeframe of the ME-WE funded project period. Furthermore, use of cross-over designs in trials testing non-pharmacological treatments is uncommon because the washout period of such interventions cannot be accurately evaluated, which poses risks for bias in outcome assessment [135] . Third, blinding of facilitators providing the ME-WE intervention is not possible, yet this is a general problem in psychosocial intervention trials [136] . Fourth, the study design does not allow one to identify components of the intervention that are most important in achieving change due to their synergetic and cumulative nature. Accordingly, the aim of this study was to determine whether the whole ME-WE intervention was more effective than a waitlist control in improving the outcome variables. Fifth, we would rely only on self-reported data. Additionally, we did not assess factors that might influence YCs' mental health, such as food insecurity and dietary and physical activity habits [16, 17, 31, 32] . However, we included overall amount of caring as a control variable, since there is evidence that YCs may lack sufficient time to engage in healthy lifestyle behaviors [137, 138] . Noteworthy, we tried to keep the assessment questionnaires to a reasonable length to limit respondents' burden. Inclusion of such protective and risk factors should be considered in future evaluations of the ME-WE intervention. Finally, only AYCs aged 15-17 were included in this study, thus the results will not be automatically generalizable to other age groups.",

In this regard, we included questions on the perceived impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on AYCs' lives and perceived mental health.

Due to COVID-19-related school closures, AYCs were deprived of a form of respite where they can focus on other aspects of their lives [27] , and reported an overall increase in time spent caring [141, 142] .",

Furthermore, given their caring responsibilities, it may be a challenge for AYCs to engage in a 7-week program, and more so in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic [141, 142] . To avert these anticipated concerns, a number of mitigation strategies will be adopted. Measures to facilitate recruitment include contacting additional potential referrers, arranging individual intake meetings with AYCs, and offering incentives (gift cards) for participation. Measures to promote retention of participants will include provision of as much logistic support as possible, regular communication and reminders and encouragement of socialization between AYCs in the intervention group.",
