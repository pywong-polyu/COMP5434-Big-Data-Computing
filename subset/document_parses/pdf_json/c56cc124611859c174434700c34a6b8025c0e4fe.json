            "text": "Work-family conflict can lead to irreparable losses to individuals, families and organizations. This matter is especially important for married working women who cannot eschew home responsibilities. To consider an appropriate intervention for this issue, we investigated the effect of a one-month intervention on support from the workplace and the family, individual characteristics and work-family conflict. This quasi-experimental longitudinal study includes an intervention group and a control group, and uses a pre-test, post-test and 6-months follow up design. Participants were 120 married women working in healthcare services, recruited from two cities in South Iran. The web-based multimedia educational program comprised four modules: one for each of the women participants, their spouses, their co-workers, and their workplace supervisors. Data collection tools included a demographic information form, and co-worker support, supervisor social support, spouse support, core self-evaluation and work-family conflict questionnaires. The effect of the intervention was examined at two post-intervention time points. A comparison of changes in mean scores between the intervention and control groups indicated that scores of supervisor support, spouse support, core self-evaluation and work-family conflict in the intervention group one month and six months after the intervention were all significantly improved compared to before the intervention. There was no benefit of the intervention in terms of a change in co-worker support. There was no significant difference across the three time points in the control group. These results confirm that online educational methods can enable health promotion professionals to reduce work-family conflict to the benefit of both employees and organizations.",

            "text": "Work and family are two important parts of people's lives. Most organizational behavior experts believe that an imbalance or conflict between one's working life and family life brings on a set of factors which mutually intensify each other. Work-life imbalance, and associated stressors have become a major challenge for those concerned with good working conditions and quality of life in general (Guest, 2002) . Work-family conflict -which includes interference of work with family life (WIF) and family interference with work (FIW) -can cause undesirable individual, family and occupational outcomes (Guest, 2002; Lallukka et al., 2013) . Negative outcomes of work-family conflict include: extreme fatigue, depression, feelings of guilt and stress, dissatisfaction with family and married life, an increase in occupational injuries, a reduction in physical health, decline in productivity, less commitment to the organization and absenteeism (Farhadi et al., 2013; Hashim et al., 2012; Lallukka et al., 2013) . These harmful outcomes of work-family conflict indicate that there is an urgent need for an intervention to manage this challenge for women who are exposed to work-family conflict. Although work-family conflict can affect all employees, it is particularly important for married women due to their roles as wife and mother, as well as worker. Previous research has indicated that when a couple both work full time, women perform twice as much housework as men (Beutell, 2010) . Similarly, there are studies which indicate that working women who get married can anticipate some degree of work-family conflict (Farhadi et al., 2013; Hashim et al., 2012; Lallukka et al., 2013) . As such, factors affecting work-family conflict and strategies which can reduce this conflict in this population should be investigated.",

Family support is considered as support from both spouse and family members, and it can be offered as emotional support (love, sympathy, trust, understanding the concern) and instrumental support (time, money, goods and services) (Namayandeh et al., 2010) . Both can help improve job performance and mood (Selvarajan et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2019; Pluut et al., 2018) reported that emotional fatigue and work-family conflict are reduced through spouse's emotional support. Similarly, Jin (2017) found that spousal support is negatively related to work-family conflict, and that high levels of spousal support can serve to increased job satisfaction and limit job burnout, even when work-family conflict is evident. Jin argued that ways to enhance spousal support should be found for improving work-family conflict. This research included an intervention designed to increase spouse support.",

Whilst it could be argued that things have improved since this 1997 US National Study of Changing Workforce, there is little evidence that this is so, and anecdotal reports indicate there remains much room for improvement (e.g. Galinsky et al., 2021; Lewis 2020) . Moreover, given that many workers with children are part of a dual-income family, it can be appreciated that organizational and family social support for working wives is vital (Selvarajan et al., 2013) . A review of the extant literature on social support to reduce work-family conflict is unilluminating in terms of understanding how social support can reduce work-family conflict beyond appreciating that the difference in study outcomes may be due to the demographic and individual differences. In their study of 380 US employees, Michel & Clark (2013) found that 25-28% of the variance in work-family conflicts was explained by individual differences. Other research findings indicate that neuroticism (Lachowska, 2014) , locus of control (Fridayanti et al., 2019; Michel & Clark, 2013) , self-esteem (Gliwny, 2020) , and self-efficacy (Deuling & Burns, 2017) are all involved in work-family conflict. These features are highly interdependent and affect each other. They are a set of these features are recognized as core self-evaluation (Chang et al., 2012) . Core self-evaluation reflects an individual's evaluation of their aptness, competence and ability (Karatepe & Azar, 2013) . Individuals who have a high core self-evaluation believe in themselves and their abilities to manage their environment; they have a positive outlook on challenging situations and are expected to seek more social support in their life (St-Onge et al., 2020) . Core self-evaluation moderates the negative effect of role overload on satisfaction with work-family balance (Wang & Li, 2019) , and if a person does not have sufficient social support in the workplace or at home, then high core self-evaluation can help compensate and reduce the work-family conflict (Haines et al., 2013) .",

Interventions based on education to reduce the impact of these predictors of work-family conflict for working women are limited. To date, studies that have tested a remedial intervention have used traditional in-person methods (Poms et al., 2016; Zarei & Kazemipour, 2020) . Another issue is that there are limited interventions in the field of spouse support in Iran. This can be related to the cultural context of the society. There is typically a strict division of labor in the home, and families expect a large contribution from women, with little contribution from other family members (Khosravan et al., 2018) . It should also be noted that this is women's experiences in many other societies to some degree. Social values and norms in a given culture can form the nature and intensity of experiences in the family and the occupational scope for women and men (Powell et al., 2009) . Therefore, work-family conflict, the factors affecting it and the strategies which decrease it should be evaluated in different societies. Nevertheless, it is important to examine the effect of social support-based educational interventions and the effect of personality, including core self-evaluation features to identify ways to reduce work-family conflict.",

The two cities are culturally close to each other, yet at a distance of about 60 km, hence minimizing the possibility of participants communicating and exchanging the information about the study. Participants from one city (Borazjan) were designated as the control group and the other (Bushehr) as the intervention group by a simple randomization method (drawing lots). Informed consent was provided by participants' spouses and co-workers, as well as supervisors of the integrated healthcare services of the two cities in the study where recruitment took place. Volunteers were incentivized to join and complete the study by including a cash prize draw for each group at the end of the study. Inclusion criteria for participation were: married female employees working in integrated healthcare services (of the given cities) who consented to participate in the study; at least 3-years or more work experience; married for 3 years or more; at least one child; and educated to at least a higher education diploma level. Exclusion criteria for the data analyses were those who: withdrew from the study after consent; did not complete the questionnaires; became ill or pregnant during the study; or did not have the consent of their spouse. According to Alavi Arjmand et al., (2013) , for sufficient power to detect a difference at the p < 0.05 level the sample size needed was n = 51 in each group. We recruited 60 persons into both groups to accommodate a drop-out rate of nearly 20% in each group. 223 female employees from Bushehr and Borazjan centers for integrated healthcare services were invited to participate in this study (88 from Borazjan and 135 from Bushehr). From the 195 volunteers who met the study inclusion criteria (78 in Borazjan and 117 in Bushehr), 30 people did not consent to participate in the study. Finally, out of 165 people who met the inclusion criteria and were willing to participate in the study, 60 volunteers from each of the two cities were randomly selected to participate in the study. 58 and 57 people completed the study in the intervention and the control group, respectively.

An 18-item questionnaire with two subscales, each with 9 items. These investigate interference of work with family life (WIF), and family life interference with work (FIW). Each subscale examines three aspects of the concepttime-based conflict, energy-based conflict, and behaviorbased conflict. Examples of items in this scale are \"My job keeps me away from my family activities more than usual\" and \"Because of the stress I endure at home, I am more involved in work issues at work.\" Items were scored using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), and higher scores indicated higher levels of work-family conflict (WFC). Good reliability was affirmed by Carlson et al., (2000) : Cronbach's alphas = 0.78 to 0.87. In the current study, Cronbach's alphas for WIF and FIW and total WFC were 0.89, 0.89 and 0.91, respectively. \u2022 Supervisor social support. A 5-item subscale from the Job Content Questionnaire (Karasek et al., 1998) and \"My coworkers advise me on my family matters\". A 5-point response scale from rarely to always (1 to 5) was used, and higher scores represented more support from coworkers. (Aslani et al., 2014) affirmed the reliability of the coworker support scale (Cronbach's alpha 0.9). In the current study, the internal consistency was confirmed: Cronbach's alpha = 0.87. \u2022 Spouse support. Social support provided by the participant's spouse was assessed using three items used by Selvarajan et al., (2013) . These questions asked who was responsible for: household chores including cleaning the house; cooking; and taking care of children. Responses have been scored using 3-point scale from 1 (I do), 2 (this responsibility is equally shared with my spouse), and 3 (my spouse has this responsibility). Higher scores represented more support. In the original study Cronbach's alpha was 0.8. In the current study, Cronbach's alpha = 0.64. \u2022 Core self-evaluation scale (Judge et al., 2003) . This is a 12-item questionnaire which measures four specific core traits (self-esteem, generalized self-efficacy, neuroticism, and locus of control). It is strongly associated with job performance, job satisfaction and life satisfaction, making it an appropriate dispositional measure for this research. Examples of items are \"I do my job successfully\" and \"I do not feel in control of the success of my work\". A 5-point Likert scale was used ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (5), and to maintain higher scores representing higher core self-evaluation items 2, 4, 6, 7, 10 and 12 were reversed. A Cronbach's alpha of 0.9 has been reported (O'Mera, 2017) . In the present study Cronbach's alpha = 0.78.",

The effect of time and the interaction between time point and group were examined for all the study variables (supervisor support, co-worker support, spouse support, work-family conflict, family-work conflict, and core self-evaluation). If the interaction between the time and the group for a given variable was significant, then an intra-group comparison was conducted separately, sorted by the intervention and control group as well as a pairwise comparison of time point. The mean of changes in the score of the perceived supervisor, co-worker, and spouse support, core self-evaluation and work-family/family-work conflict between both groups of intervention and control was also compared during the study according to time point (before intervention, one-month and six-months after the intervention).

We found that the multimedia educational intervention significantly increased core self-evaluation, supervisor and spouse support and there was a reciprocal reduction in work-family conflict, and family-work conflict in the intervention group at the one-month and six-month follow-up time points, when compared to a control group. There was no impact of the co-workers education on reducing work-family conflict for participants. On interesting aspect of our findings was that whilst the intervention clearly had a significant impact post-test, and the improvement was maintained at follow-up, there was generally a lack of significant difference between post-test and follow-up (1 month and 6 months after the intervention). So, whilst an improvement was quickly seen and to some extent sustained, there was no further improvement. A hard look at the data indicated some reduction in support, if minor after six months. This was not expected. Essentially, this can be due to forgetting the education provided due to the long distance between the test post and follow-up, and an even longer time in previous levels of support. Altogether, these findings indicate the importance of the education and a need to repeat the education until the required levels of support become the social norm. Sustainability is an important aspect that should be considered in all intervention programs.",

We suggest this increase was due to a change in supervisor's attitudes and perceptions as a result of engaging with the premises of the education. The educational program led them to understand the benefit of supporting employees who have family responsibilities as well as work demands, and the negative consequences of work-family conflict. This finding is in accord with a study performed by Odle-Dusseau et al., (2016) which indicated that educating work supervisors on matters of family-centred support is effective. This in turn had organizational benefits as increased support also improved employees' job performance, organizational commitment and job satisfaction. Similarly, Kelly et al., (2014) conducted a randomized trial which showed that their 'STAR' intervention (supervisor family-centred support education and individual education in order to augment control over optimal working time) increased supervisor support and control over working time by employees.",

Intragroup comparisons showed that there was no change in spouse support post-test or at followup in the intervention group, and in the control group where there was a difference over time, this was not in the right direction. That is, during the period of the study spouse support did not improve for the intervention groups, and significantly decreased for the control group. This is not an obvious reason. Nevertheless, we can make some assumptions from the timing of this research -during the COVID-19 pandemic -which work demands increased for these female healthcare workers, who were also wives and mothers, and that family support from the husband did not change. Or at least, the improvement provided by the intervention was not sufficient to mitigate the increase in work demands and improve WFC. Likewise, for the female healthcare workers, who were also wives and mothers in the control group without any change in family support during the challenging time for healthcare workers, there was a perceived decrease in support because of the increase in work demands. We acknowledge this is speculative, but plausible. To date there is a dearth of peerreviewed empirical studies that have looked at spousal support for healthcare workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Certainly, previous studies have indicated that instrumental support provided by a spouse can be important for the well-being of women, especially in cultures with little gender equality (Bayhan Karapinar et al., 2020) . For example, Cooper et al., (2021) used an intervention program called RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) to increase exclusive breastfeeding and family planning in Tanzania, and found that including male spouses in household education was important for effectiveness. Similarly, a couples support-centred intervention led to an understanding in men that supporting one's spouse creates increased affection and interest between the mother and infant in postpartum women when compared to a control group (Khanzadeh & Mogaddam Tabrizi, 2020) . In cultures such as Iran, where men and women internalize their traditional gender roles, and believe that their family life and work are affected by a woman's work outside the home, the participation of spouses in household chores is typically inadequate, and their expectations of women a cause of conflict (Pourmeidani et al., 2014) . In our study, spouse support education may have increased the support by changing the men's traditional outlook about the role division.",

The intervention we utilized to increase co-worker support did not lead to significant changes in the intervention group compared to the control group. It is difficult to fully appreciate the reason why this was so, although the few previous intervention studies in the literature have not measured changes in the extent of coworker support, and just the results obtained from coworker support are provided. Jungert et al., (2018) , for example, indicated that a short-term supportive intervention provided by coworkers can be effective in creating support for the essential needs of the employees and increasing their incentive, but did not overtly measure change. Chiaburu (2010) argued that co-workers could be more significant in the professional development of employees than organization and supervisor support, but in Chiaburu's study, unlike our study, the focus was on the transfer and retention of the educational provided for workplace effectiveness per se, rather than the relationships among co-workers for social support to ameliorate work-family conflict. Critically, the two studies together both indicate difficulties in harnessing co-worker social support to reduce work-family conflict. It remains, however, that the lack of influence of the multimedia educational program we provided to improve co-worker support could be due to the specific conditions caused by prevalence of the Covid-19 pandemic raging at the time of the study. Teleworking, and a reduction in the presence of co-workers clearly reduced opportunities to provide support at times of need. Similarly, the requirement to keep a 'social distance' reduced the interaction of people who were working in the workplace. Together, this situation prevented consideration of the demand and provision of the support that could have been expected -at least pre-Covid-19. Consequently, we have to recognize that the supportive educational provided to co-workers in this study was not been fully implemented in the current context. It is difficult to say that there was no effect. We can only consider that the conditions were not conducive to test that aspect of the program.",

The rationale was that the educational intervention would improve support in the workplace, and in turn, work-family conflict which causes sleep problems. However, the educational intervention did not improve work-family conflict compared to a control group, nor sleep problems.

This successfully increased participant's core self-evaluation after the intervention compared to before the intervention. This is an original finding. There are no previous educational health promotion intervention studies in this area, to our knowledge, in the extant literature. There are studies that have used the component parts of this concept to suggest our finding was to be expected. For example, (Jahani Eftekhari et al., 2020) ran a randomized clinical trial in which the intervention was based on selfefficacy theory and health literacy to enhance health promotion behaviours of female volunteers from health centers. They found significantly increased self-efficacy, health literacy and health promotion behaviours in the intervention group, relative to a control group. Also, a semi-empirical intervention that involved nursing students indicated that a self-esteem reinforcement intervention had considerable effect on improving levels of self-esteem and self-efficacy (Ribeiro et al., 2020) . The increase in core self-evaluation in the present study can be explained as the reciprocal effect of the elements of self-efficacy, self-esteem and locus of control on each other and the synergy in the final results. The multimedia educational program may also have helped participants identify their individual resources and reinforce them. That is, the intervention may work because it supports people to investigate their neuroticism and perceive stressors more as a challenge and less as a threat.",

That is, social support provides personal resources that can be invested in one's work (family) which then allows them to be effective in this field.
