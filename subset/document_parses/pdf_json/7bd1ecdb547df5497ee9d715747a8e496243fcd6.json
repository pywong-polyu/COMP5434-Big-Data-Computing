In the current experiments, we evaluated aging-associated and reproduction-influenced changes in motor function, utilizing changes in tremor amplitude and grip strength. Tremor amplitude was increased with aging in normal female mice. This increase in tremor amplitude was prevented in aged female mice that received ovarian tissue transplants, both in mice that received germ cell-containing or germ cell-depleted ovarian tissue. Grip strength was decreased with aging in normal female mice. This decrease in grip strength was prevented in aged female mice that received either germ cell-containing or germ cell-depleted tissue transplants. As expected, estradiol levels decreased with aging in normal female mice. Estradiol levels did not change with exposure to young ovarian tissues/ cells. Surprisingly, estradiol levels were not increased Abstract A critical mediator of evolution is natural selection, which operates by the divergent reproductive success of individuals and results in conformity of an organism with its environment. Reproductive function has evolved to support germline transmission. In mammalian ovaries, this requires healthy, active gonad function, and follicle development. However, healthy follicles do not contribute to germline transmission in a dead animal. Therefore, support of the health and survival of the organism, in addition to fertility, must be considered as an integral part of reproductive function. Reproductive and chronological aging both impose a burden on health and increase disease rates. Tremors are a common movement disorder and are often correlated with increasing age.

However, the timing of menopause or the end of the reproductive life span in women has remained relatively constant over this same period. Reproduction is often thought to negatively influence health and survival. High fecundity has historically been associated with short lifespans among mammals [47] . Opposition to this concept comes from the manipulation of reproduction to increase or decrease exposure to reproductive function and the observations of the influence of these manipulations on health and longevity [29] . Results from these types of experiments suggest that there are still large gaps in our knowledge about the effects of reproduction on health and survival. Reproductive function can significantly influence nonreproductive biological functions and is exquisitely sensitive to aging-related changes.",

The survival influence of reproductive effort can be separated from the fertility effort, in the case of the current experiments by removing the influence of the germ cells or follicles, which normally direct the ovary toward the support of germline transmission or production of offspring. Without the follicles present to direct the ovarian somatic tissues toward the production of offspring, the ovarian somatic tissues take on the role of maintaining survival of the organism. This support for survival will continue as long as the organism has the potential to reproduce and/or is able to contribute to the support of existing offspring (the grandmother hypothesis).",

This association is particularly striking in women. Prior to reproductive decline, females hold a significant health advantage over males of the same age [10] . However, at the time of reproductive decline, the increase in disease risks for women significantly outpaces those of men. This dependence on reproductive function for the maintenance of health is exemplified in surgically menopausal women and in women with premature ovarian failure, who suffer from a decline in health at a much younger age than in women with traditional menopausal timing [18, 40, 43] . Previous experiments by our group have demonstrated significant health and longevity benefits from manipulation of ovarian function ( [14, 25-27, 30, 36-38, 44] ) . In the current experiments, we evaluated aging-associated and reproduction-influenced changes in motor function, utilizing two measures of health span; tremor amplitude and grip strength.",

Measuring tremors in mice is non-invasive, repeatable, and as outlined in the current manuscript, provides accurate quantitative data [46] . Grip strength as a measure of muscle strength is a more commonly used, non-invasive, and convenient method to evaluate the effects of aging on motor performance and neuromuscular function in rodent models [4, 41] . The well-established supportive role of ovarian hormones in many aspects of female health implicates the loss of hormone production from actively cycling germ cells, as the principal cause of increased disease risks at menopause. While the value of ovarian hormones in female health is unquestionable, efforts to replace the hormonal milieu of actively cycling ovaries in peri-and postmenopausal women have struggled to reliably restore the health benefits enjoyed by young, reproductively cycling women with young ovaries. Preliminary data from our laboratory suggest that estrogen levels are not changed in post-reproductive recipients of new ovaries, compared with age-matched controls, suggesting a non-estrogenic influence of young ovarian tissue. Here, we specifically examined the influence of young ovarian tissue on tremor amplitude and grip strength in the presence or absence of ovarian germ cell influence.",

Female CBA/J mice were obtained from the National Institute of Health-National Institute of Aging (Bethesda, MD, USA) and Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME, USA). Each mouse was individually housed in ventilated cages (Green Line IVC Sealsafe Plus, Techniplast, West Chester, PA, USA) containing corncob bedding (7097 Corncob, Harlan Teklad, Bartonville, IL, USA). Each home cage had deionized water, laboratory rodent diet ad libitum (2018 Teklad Global 18% Protein Rodent Diet, Harlan Teklad, Bartonville, IL, USA), and added enrichment (4 cm dia \u00d7 10 cm L paper tubes, Nestlets\u00ae, Kimwipes\u00ae). All females were exposed to male mice/bedding throughout the study (female mice were no more than two cages away from a cage containing a male mouse and/or a small amount of soiled bedding from a male's cage was mixed with fresh bedding at cage changes for female mice). The colony environment had fresh filtered air (15 changes/hour), regulated temperatures of 21 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C, humidity of 50 \u00b1 20%, and an even lightdark cycle (12:12 h) and was located in the Utah Science, Technology and Research Center (USTAR) at Utah State University.

Mice were monitored twice daily and more frequently if health concerns arose. Mice with acute weight loss were treated with moistened food and subcutaneous fluids. Individuals with acute urine staining or rectal/vaginal prolapse were manually cleaned and treated with Desitin\u00ae. Mice were monitored daily and any moribund, aged mice who exhibited overt clinical signs of catatonia were euthanized. Criteria for potential euthanasia was determined in coordination with the attending veterinarian and included, but was not limited to mice found in poor condition with or without crusting around the perineum, diarrhea, urine staining, persistent vaginal prolapse, chronic vulva/rectal swelling, respiratory distress, anorexia, kyphosis, poor coat, and unusual weight loss or gain. An increased rate of weight loss was the most critical factor for determining a moribund state in aged mice. Unexpected deaths were uncommon, but included euthanasia due to neoplastic growths, decubitus ulcers, or uncontrolled cataleptic seizures [25] .",

Briefly, recipient and donor mice were anesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of an anesthetic cocktail (100 mg/kg ketamine, 20 mg/kg xylazine, and 10 mg/kg acepromazine). The ovaries of the donor mice were exposed starting with a paralumbar incision. Once through the skin and peritoneum, the ovarian fat pad, located distal to the kidney, was placed into the field of view and positioned with a clamp to expose the ovarian bursa containing the ovary. The ovary was then removed by incising the bursa opposite the ovarian hilum. The ovary was gently removed from the bursa and the hilum clamped to prevent bleeding.

Control mice demonstrated an aging-associated physiological decline in forelimb strength as expected. Increased exposure to young ovarian tissue/cells improved/ restored grip strength to that seen in much younger mice, suggesting a strong connection between motor function and ovarian age. However, this effect appeared to be independent of germ cells and independent of any change in circulating estradiol levels. In mice, it has been reported that the force generated by soleus muscle declined by ~ 25% with age and did so around the age at which ovaries fail in the strain of mice used [33] . In other studies, leg muscles from ovariectomized mice were 10-20% weaker than corresponding muscles from ovary-intact and 17\u03b2-estradiol replaced mice [23, 32, 33, 45] .

Work in primitive species has identified FoxO pathway signaling as a potential contributor to the gonadal somatic tissue-dependent enhancement of survival. Aging can induce the loss of the protective functions of FoxOs, which in mammals, can exert their protective effects through the regulation of superoxide dismutases (SODs) and have roles in the regulation of GSHmediated detoxification by inducing the transcription of GSTM1 [13, 35] . When considering neuromuscular function specifically, aging may increase oxidative stress in motor neurons [11] . Preliminary analysis of liver proteins by our group has revealed that both GSTM1 and SOD2 are increased with aging (unpublished observations), which may be reflecting the degree of oxidative stress in the local environment [16] . An increase in both proteins was also observed with aging in human ovaries (unpublished observations). Both GSTM1 and SOD2 were decreased with transplantation of young ovarian tissue to the levels found in young mice. An additional pilot study revealed that, while FoxO1 protein was abundant in ovarian transudate from 60-day-old ovaries, FoxO1 protein was absent in ovarian transudate from 18-month-old ovaries (unpublished observations).",

Increased exposure of post-reproductive females to young ovarian tissue improved/restored tremor amplitude and grip strength parameters to reflect measures found in much younger mice and did so independent of ovarian germ cells and circulating estradiol. In addition, while grip strength is well established as a measure of aging-related health span change, the current results suggest that tremor amplitude, which is independent of subject collaboration, may serve as an additional measure to determine biological age/aging and health span. The current results suggest the presence of a germ celland estradiol-independent positive ovarian influence on aging-associated changes in motor function. Longevity is not favored by natural selection unless living longer results in higher reproductive success. Reproductive success is dependent on elevated levels of gonadal hormones (compared with pre-and post-reproductive hormone levels). However, lower levels of reproductive hormones do not appear to be detrimental to pre-reproductive survival, and exogenously elevated hormones post-reproductively have inconsistent survival benefits at best. There is ample evidence for the role of ovarian tissue in survival and longevity, and an unquestionable role for follicle-driven hormone production in reproduction. However, the role of follicle-driven hormone production in survival and longevity is unclear. Particularly in view that women can live half of their lifespan in a post-reproductive state. The results presented here bring into question the role of follicledriven hormone production in survival, and support a hormone-independent role for the ovary in female health and survival.",
