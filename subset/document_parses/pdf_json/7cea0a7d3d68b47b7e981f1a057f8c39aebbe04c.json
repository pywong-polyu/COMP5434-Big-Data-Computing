Asprosin is a novel adipokine responsible for the regulation of appetite and the release of glucose from the liver, and its levels are pathologically elevated in obesity. The aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of 8-week Nordic walking (NW) training at maximal fat oxidation intensity (FAT max ) on changes in body mass, as well as those in insulin resistance and asprosin levels among young women with visceral obesity and metabolic disorders.",

According to a report by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) (2019) 463 million adults (20-79 years) had diabetes worldwide in 2019, of which 4.2 million died from this disease. According to forecasts, the number of patients and diabetes is expected to increase to 578 million by 2030 and to 700 million by 2045. In Europe, in 2045, a 15% increase in the number of diabetics compared to 2019 is expected (International Diabetes Federation (IDF), 2019). Currently, the coexistence of glucose and lipid metabolism disorders, as well as arterial hypertension, which constitute criteria of metabolic syndrome (MetS), are more and more frequently observed, and concern mainly obese and insulinresistant individuals (Reaven, 1988; McCracken et al., 2018) . It is estimated that up to 40% of adults in developed countries have MetS (McCracken et al., 2018) . Additional symptoms of MetS include: hyperleptinemia and decreased secretion of adiponectin (Puustinen et al., 2011) . The occurrence of MetS increases the risk of T2DM (twofold) (Grundy, 2012) , cardiovascular diseases (CVD), including atherosclerosis (fivefold) (Doyle et al., 2012) , and furthermore increases overall and CVD-related mortality (Isomaa et al., 2001) . In recent studies, it has been indicated that obesity may also contribute to a more severe course of SARS-CoV-2 infection (Popkin et al., 2020) .",

Asprosin is composed of 140 amino acids and is the C-terminal product of the cleavage of profibrillin encoded by the FBN1 gene (Romere et al., 2016) . Romere et al. (2016) showed that asprosin is a hormone secreted into the bloodstream mainly by white adipose tissue adipocytes (Romere et al., 2016) . Asprosin regulates glucose release from hepatocytes by activating the protein-G/cAMP/PKA pathway via the OLFR734 receptor (Romere et al., 2016; Li et al., 2019) . Its highest concentration is recorded in fasting state (Romere et al., 2016) . An increase in the concentration of asprosin has impact on the development of insulin resistance and cell apoptosis (Romere et al., 2016; Duerrschmid et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2019) . It has been shown that asprosin crosses the blood-brain barrier and is orexigenic (Romere et al., 2016; Duerrschmid et al., 2017) , however, in some studies, this has not been confirmed . On the other hand, the gluconeogenic and appetite-stimulating effects of this cytokine were established in the research by Li et al. (2018) .",

However, in obese children, the concentration of asprosin in the blood is lower compared to their peers demonstrating body mass within the norm . There was also an increased level of circulating asprosin in fasting state, both in adults and children with insulin resistance (Romere et al., 2016; Wang C.Y. et al., 2019; Wang M. et al., 2019) , in people with T2DM (Wang Y. et al., 2018) , and in women with polycystic ovary syndrome (Alan et al., 2019) .

In our study, after 4 weeks of NW, positive somatic changes were noted in the examined women, which showed a reduction in visceral obesity. There was a decrease in waist and HC, as well as a reduction in anthropometric indices reflecting the degree of body fat, linking changes in the abovementioned circumferences with BH, i.e., WHtR and BAI. The clinical significance of these changes was high. Extending the training stage to 8 weeks resulted in intensification of these effects. However, during the entire training phase, we did not observe any significant changes in body mass, BMI or WHR. A WHtR value \u2265 0.5 indicates an increased risk of metabolic diseases .

Besnier et al.

Furthermore, applying a training period of 8 weeks, as in our study, Tan et al. (2012) reported a decrease in body mass, BMI, mass and percentage of adipose tissue as well as WHR in young women (20-23 years old). Jogging training sessions were performed five times a week for 60 min, their intensity was about 54% VO 2max , and the maximum fat burning was 0.43 g/min (Tan et al., 2012) . A reduction in body mass, BMI and waist circumference was also reported in the research by Botero et al. (2013) conducted among women aged 27-46 with excess body mass after 12 weeks of training on a cycloergometer (three times a week, 60 min). Also, the implementation of NW training at the intensity of FAT max caused a reduction in body mass and BMI, but in the group of older women (over 55 years of age) who were overweight, and these changes were recorded in a shorter time than in our study, because they were the result of 6-week training (three times a week, 90 min) (Cebula et al., 2020) . The study by Dumortier et al. (2003) included women and men with MetS above the age of 50. They performed 8 weeks of exercises on a cycloergometer at an intensity corresponding to FAT max (three times a week, 40 min). There was a significant reduction in body mass, fat percentage and BMI. Similar to the results of our own research, waist and HC in people with MetS decreased significantly, while the WHR index did not change significantly (Dumortier et al., 2003) .",

Trabka et al.

NW sessions were performed three times a week for 40 min, and their intensity increased every 2 weeks by 10%, within the range of 50-80% heart rate reserve (Trabka et al., 2014) .",

However, this time was insufficient to achieve results in terms of lowering glucose and insulin levels or reducing insulin resistance. It is likely that extending the training period could cause such changes. In addition, after the applied NW training, a significant reduction in BAI, as well as waist and HC and WHtR index, was noted, but without changes in body mass, BMI and WHR. The results of our research demonstrate that despite the lack of changes in body mass, low-intensity physical training reduces visceral obesity, and thus, limits the further development of metabolic disorders.",
