Here we show that aggregated cultural values of nations, derived from World Values Survey data, have been at least as important as top-down government actions in predicting the impact of COVID-19. At the population level, the cultural factor of cosmopolitanism, together with obesity, predict higher numbers of deaths in the first two months of COVID-19 on the scale of nations. At the state level, the complementary variables of government efficiency and public trust in institutions predict lower death numbers. The difference in effect between individual beliefs and behaviors, versus state-level actions, suggests that open cosmopolitan societies may face greater challenges in limiting a future pandemic or other event requiring a coordinated national response among the population. More generally, mass cultural values should be considered in crisis preparations.",

Since culture is the context for behavior (Gelfand et al. 2020; Muthukrishna 2020 ; Zhang and Centola 2019)-social scientists maintain that culture fundamentally determines behavior, values, beliefs, and even perceived reality in a society (Cronk 1999; Durkheim 1915; Henrich 2015 )-effectiveness of intervention on COVID-19 by national governments ought to reflect cultural values among the people of those countries. As cultural values vary substantially across the world (Aksoy et al. 2020; Inglehart and Welzel 2005; Ruck et al. 2020a) , there is a motivation to ascertain whether cultural values predict national COVID-19 rates.",

The cultural factors we consider here are secular-rationality (RAT), cosmopolitanism (COS) and institutional trust (INST). We expect institutional trust (INST) within a population, which is likely to help government efforts to mitigate a pandemic (Aksoy et al. 2020) , may exhibit effects in concert with the government efficiency variable. Secular-rationality (RAT) is correlated with secularism, political engagement (and critique), and respect for individual rights, but also low prosociality (Ruck et al. 2020a) . We hypothesize that RAT would predict higher epidemic spread (and hence more deaths) among people who are more individualistic and perhaps more heterogeneous in how they follow guidelines. We also predict that the cultural factor of Cosmopolitanism (COS) would, all else being equal, predict more coronavirus deaths via the effect of personal intermixing. Populations with high Cosmopolitanism (COS) are more open to have neighbors that are foreign or of a different ethnicity (Ruck et al. 2018 (Ruck et al. , 2020a .",

We focus on Day 50 in Table 2 , when the factor COS exhibits a larger effect than RAT (secular-rationalism). Strictly speaking, COS is a predictive factor in COVID deaths, not necessarily the ultimate cause. COS probably captures a cultural openness to human interaction, which facilitates COVID spread. Given the importance of government action (Hale et al. 2020 )-in imposing travel restrictions, lockdowns and/or suspensions of educational, commercial and religious activities (Flaxman et al. 2020; Hsiang et al. 2020 )-a reasonable counter-argument is that COS merely predicts the ability of national governments to control the pandemic. The problem with this is that authoritarian governments are better at imposing restrictions, and authoritarianism tends to correlate negatively with COS (Ruck et al. 2020a ). Another counter-argument might be that nations with lower COS are less prone to accurately/honestly report their COVID statistics, and hence higher COS predicts higher reported COVID-19 deaths. This is possible and should be the subject of more granular, qualitative research. Among demographic controls, population size and obesity predicted more deaths. By Day 50, obesity had the largest effect on COVID-19 deaths (Table 2) . This was expected, as obesity increases the risk of fatality from COVID-19 (Hamer et al. 2020) . Early in the outbreak (Day 10), higher GDP per capita predicts higher COVID-19 death rates (Table 2) . While GDP correlates with obesity and life expectancy, this additional effect of GDP on COVID-19 may reflect economic incentives of wealthier populations to resist shutdown measures.",

There is also a secondary effect of institutional confidence predicting lower deaths.

Cultural and political variables, which are inherent to our regressions, may also affect how COVID-19 deaths are counted. We nevertheless believe the effect of reporting differences to be small in our results. First, a plot of cumulative data from 25 Nov 2020, from 167 countries (with at least 1,000 reported cases) follow a linear slope (i.e., case fatality ratio, CFR) of 2.0% (r 2 = 0.89). Notably, cumulative figures from the four income categories for nations (low, lower middle, upper middle, high) fall on this same line. Hence, if deaths at lower income levels were significantly underreported, cases would have to be under-reported by the same percentage. The CFR across these categories ranges from 1.56% in low income countries to 3.09% in upper middle-income countries, suggesting some under-reporting of deaths in lower income countries. In log-transformed numbers, however, this is only a 15% difference, very slight on a log-log plot of cases versus deaths.",

The highest CFRs are in Yemen (29%), Mexico (9.7%), Sudan (7.4%), Ecuador (7.1%) and Bolivia (6.2%), all of which are countries with genuinely, tragically high COVID-19 death rates as opposed to outstanding administrative protocols for reporting them. In summary, while there is uncertainty in the COVID-19 death numbers, we do not believe these uncertainties are systematic or large enough to explain our regression results.",

Percentage urban population for nations in 2017 come from the World Bank's development indicators (Ritchie and Roser 2018) . Obesity is measured as the percentage of the population aged over 18 that have a BMI greater than 30, using data from the World Health Organization (https ://ourwo rldin data.org/obesi ty). We measured exposure to SARS during the 2002-2004 outbreak as a dummy variable, where a country is assigned a one if they had at least one case and a zero otherwise (WHO 2020). The countries effected by SARS are: China Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada, Singapore, Vietnam', United States, Philippines, Thailand, Germany, France, Australia, Malaysia, Sweden, Great Britain, Italy, India, South Korea, Indonesia, South Africa, Kuwait, Ireland, New Zealand, Romania, Russia, Spain and Switzerland. Cultural factors, including secular-humanism (RAT), openness to minorities (COS) and trust in institutions (INST), were derived from multivariate statistics and the World and European Values surveys (WEVS) data from 109 nations (EVS 2011; Inglehart and Welzel 2005; Ruck et al. 2018 Ruck et al. , 2020a WVS 2020) . The WEVS data are derived from the same 64 questions in the five waves of these surveys at 5-year intervals since 1990, administered to 476,583 participants from 109 different nations. These data were compressed into multivariate factors in two steps. The first used Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) to identify nine cultural factors underlying the WEVS data. From the EFA step, we summarized the common variance in the WEVS data and thereby remove the portion of the total variance that is likely to be measurement error or other forms of statistical noise. We then used the EFA factor loadings as weights for Principal Component Analysis (PCA), as the orthogonality of the principal components is advantageous for our subsequent regression modelling.",

Trust in Institutions, INST, was correlated with cultural factors such as confidence in institutions (r = 0.58) and interest in politics (r = 0.86). Individuals with high trust in institutions report high confidence in institutions like the media, the army and government and also have an active interest in politics. Secular-Humanism, RAT, is correlated with secularism (r = 0.76), political engagement (r = 0.62), respect for individual rights (r = 0.59) and low prosociality (r = \u2212 0.45) (Ruck et al. 2018) . High RAT reflects survey respondents who reported, for example, that religion is not important in their lives, that they are likely to attend protests or sign petitions, they only pay taxes when coerced and believe that homosexuality and divorce are justifiable (Inglehart and Welzel 2005; Ruck et al. 2018) . Cosmopolitanism, COS, is correlated with the exploratory cultural factors for 'openness to out-groups' (r = 0.78), 'openness to norm violators' (r = 0.78) and 'subjective well-being' (r = 0.43). High COS implies willingness to have neighbours that are immigrants, from another race, homosexual or from other stigmatized groups; as well as self-reporting happiness and life satisfaction (Ruck et al. 2018 (Ruck et al. , 2020b .",
