The model was used to explore the effects of control measures, such as active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine on the epidemic. Considering the condition that R 0 = 1.2, when a case of an imported asymptomatic infected individual (AII) was reported in the community, the implementation of control measures reduced the number of AIIs and patients by 62.2% and 62.4%, respectively. The number of undetected AIIs and patients peaked at 302 days of the epidemic, reaching 53 and 20 individuals, respectively. The implementation of sustained active tracing, laboratory testing, active treatment, and home quarantine can significantly reduce the probability of disease outbreaks and block the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic caused by AIIs in the community.

            "text": "The findings of the above-mentioned studies suggest that AIIs carry transmission risks. The first factor is the covertness of transmission. As AIIs do not exhibit clear pneumonia or signs, it is difficult to detect these individuals in the population, which can lead to problems in preventing transmission. The second factor is the subjectivity of the symptoms. Individuals with mild or atypical pneumonia may think that they have not been infected with SARS-CoV-2. Hence, they will not take the initiative to seek medical help and are difficult to detect in routine clinical work. The third factor is the limitations of detection. Because of the presence of a testing window period, it is difficult to identify all AIIs using nucleic acid and serological tests. The existing AIIs in China have been primarily identified through active screening of individuals who had close contact with confirmed cases, retrospective investigation of infection causes among patients, screening of individuals exposed to clustered outbreaks, and active testing of personnel in high-risk areas. However, identifying AIIs remains a challenge 13 .",

As AIIs experience mild or no pneumonia, it is impossible to include the discovery and isolation of AIIs as one of the leading measures for pandemic prevention and control in www.nature.com/scientificreports/ clinical practice 13 . Therefore, some AIIs are not usually included in the prevention and control of the pandemic, thus, increasing the difficulty and uncertainty in identifying and managing this group. Questions, such as the role played by AIIs in pandemic transmission, whether AIIs can cause the sustained presence of COVID-19 in the population, and whether the management measures for AIIs adopted by China can effectively curb the spread of the pandemic are all of great significance for a more profound understanding of the transmission mechanisms underlying the COVID-19 pandemic and for guiding the government in taking more precise measures to prevent and control the pandemic. Based on the epidemiological characteristics of AIIs, an individual-based stochastic computer model was established in this study to simulate the spread of the epidemic within the community, which incorporated some of the prevention and control measures adopted by China in response to AIIs, to quantitatively analyze the impact of AIIs on the development trends of the pandemic and to theoretically evaluate the effectiveness of the interventional measures. In addition, we would like to explore consistent solution programs during a regular pandemic as well as emergency prevention and control measures in case of an outbreak because in the real world, non-special and urgent strict control measures may be the normal state of society.",

The outbreak occurred within a closed community of 3300 households and approximately 10,300 residents. The number of family members varied from one to seven, and followed a Poisson distribution with a mean of 3. Within the study period, no births (immigration) and deaths (emigration) were reported in the community, and the residents were generally susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. 2. All AIIs and patients underwent the incubation period, infectious period, and recovery period. No group was infectious during the incubation and recovery periods, and viral nucleic acid could not be detected in the respiratory tract specimens. Both groups were infectious during the infectious period, and viral nucleic acids could be detected in respiratory tract specimens. 3. Patients who were diagnosed were quarantined in the hospital to receive appropriate treatment. AIIs who were discovered were quarantined at home for 14 days. None of the current studies have provided a definite period in which the AIIs become infectious; hence, the infectious period of AIIs was determined based on the symptomatic period of COVID-19 patients. Further, once patients and AIIs were confirmed, all their family members were regarded as close contacts and were quarantined for a maximum of 14 days, after which they were allowed to move freely. 4. AIIs and patients developed immunity after prolonged exposure to the virus and could not be re-infected with SARS-CoV-2. 5. The event involving the transmission from AIIs or patients to susceptible persons during the infectious period is a Poisson process with a rate of (where is the basic reproduction number divided by the infectious period).

Outbreak was defined as the occurrence of more than ten patients or more than 20 AIIs within the community. There were 3300 households within the community and approximately 10,300 residents. Figure 1a1 shows that when R 0 = 1.2, p = 0.2, and q = 0, and under the conditions of an outbreak, the median infection rate of AIIs and median incidence rate of patients at 730 days of the epidemic were 0.22 and 0.06, respectively. As q increased, the infection rate and incidence rate decreased. When q = 1, the medians decreased to 0.01 and 0.005, respectively. Figure 1a2 shows that compared with R 0 = 1, when R 0 = 1.2, the probability of patients and AIIs to cause an outbreak increases. Figure 1b shows that without the tracing of infection sources and close contacts and without the home quarantine of AIIs, considering the premise of a community outbreak, the cumulative number of AIIs and patients during a community outbreak increased from almost 0 to 3653 (25-75% percentile [50% P]: 3529-3741) and 907 (50% P: 875-949), respectively. Figure 1c shows that if the tracing of infection sources and close contacts and the home quarantine of AIIs after detection were implemented, considering the premise of a community outbreak, the number of AIIs and patients increased to 1381 (50% P: 1092-1620) and 340 (50% P: 272-414), respectively, when t = 730. In the absence of interventions, the medians of the two groups decreased by 62.2% and 62.5%, respectively. Figure 1d shows that the number of undetected AIIs and patients initially increased, but eventually decreased to 0. The proportion of AIIs and COVID-19 patients peaked at 302 days, reaching 53 (50% P: 27-71) and 20 individuals (50% P: 10-25), respectively.

Figure 2b shows that the number of patients peaked at 13, 15, and 16 days, reaching 10 (50% P: 7-13), 16 (50% P: 13-19), and 21 individuals (50% P: 17-24), respectively. Sensitivity analyses. In this study, sensitivity analyses of the five parameters and a continuous time series of the sum of asymptomatic infected individuals and patients each day were conducted. We obtained 500 samples from a uniform distribution for each parameter range. PRCCs near -1 or + 1 indicate that the parameter has a strong negative or positive impact on the output, respectively, whereas those closer to 0 indicate less effect on the output result for that parameter (Fig. 3) .

            "text": "The advantages of this study are mainly manifested in the following aspects: First, the individual-based computer model combines the covertness and infectivity of AIIs who underwent preventive and control measures, such as tracing, treatment, and quarantine, which made the model more compatible with the actual conditions of the epidemic prevention and control. Second, the model randomly assigns the parameters for the daily activities and disease characteristics of residents as well as medical treatment according to their respective statistical distributions, which accords the model richer and more powerful analytical capabilities compared with the traditional dynamic models. Thus, the results of the model will provide more precise guidance for the government's undertakings in preventing and controlling the disease. Third, there is a current absence of epidemiological studies on AIIs; therefore, using computer simulations to quantitatively analyze the epidemiological distribution of AIIs and patients in the population, we have provided a preliminary solution to address the international concerns of coping with AIIs. The results in Fig. 1a show that when one case of imported AII is reported in a community, the probability of an epidemic outbreak decreases with the increase in parameter q. This finding reflects the fact that tracing the infection sources and close contacts of patients not only enables the early discovery of AIIs and patients in the community, but also lays the foundation for the timely isolation of AIIs at home and the isolation of patients for treatment. This, in turn, will reduce the probability of epidemic outbreaks and the incidence rates among residents. In addition, the probability of outbreak is related to the infection time of the imported AII; that is, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the earlier the infection time, the shorter the infectious period in the community, and the lower the probability of an epidemic outbreak. The model randomly assigns the infection time, which ensures the objectivity of the results to a certain extent. The results in Fig. 1b,c show that in the absence of any intervention measures, where AIIs and patients are allowed to transmit the disease in the community, approximately 44% of residents will be infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the event of an outbreak. In the presence of intervention measures, that is, though the infection sources and close contacts of patients have a 50% chance of being discovered, the proportion of infected residents decreased by 62% in the event of an outbreak compared with the absence of such control measures. This finding once again confirms that prevention and control measures can significantly reduce the risk of infection among residents.",

The results in Fig. 1d ,e show that the number of undetected AIIs and patients as well as the number of quarantined residents and households initially increased, but eventually decreased to 0.

The PRCCs of R 1 were slightly lower than those of R 0 . This may be because although R 1 was greater than R 0 , patients accounted for a smaller proportion of infected persons compared with AIIs, which restricted the contribution of the number of patients to the growth in the number of infected persons. In addition, a larger p value resulted in a greater number of patients; hence, patients with greater infectivity had an increased number of infected persons. As q increased, the number of AIIs and patients detected increased, which reduced the number of newly infected persons. The length of tracing time \u03c4 had a relatively small effect on the total number of infected persons.",

This is because the design of this model is not suitable for the simulation of clustered outbreaks, and a new model must be established for such analyses. Second, this model does not consider the active screening of key populations. This is because most countries do not conduct mandatory pathogenic testing of their populations; hence, this program is not universally implemented. Third, AIIs are still infectious during home quarantine and will infect their family members. Therefore, appropriate control measures must be adopted in accordance with the national conditions of each country. Lastly, owing to constraints on computing power, this model is limited to a closed community. However, during the pandemic, most countries and regions have adopted policies, such as restricting movement across borders, and strict home quarantine. Therefore, most regions can be considered to be relatively closed, and the results of this study are applicable to areas with pandemic outbreaks where restrictions on population movement and personnel activities have been imposed.
