To learn more about future healthcare professionals' volunteering during such an outbreak, we conducted a survey among 417 students of Poznan University of Medical Sciences. Our findings suggest that although numerous studies demonstrate that traditional, value-based volunteering is decreasing, and especially higher education students are more oriented toward their own career, in the times of the current health crisis, young peoples' involvement in volunteering has been mainly driven by altruism and the ethical imperative to serve their community, their fellow healthcare professionals and their patients. Thus, while the prime role of the volunteering was to relieve the healthcare system, it also reinforced such important medical values as altruism, public service and professional solidarity. Moreover, it proved that whilst risk is inherent to medicine, the students' volunteering is truly a moral enterprise.",

            "text": "Ever since the first case of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in Poland was confirmed on 4 March 2020, the Polish government has imposed different types of lockdown-type control measures, including the closing of universities, which moved to online lectures, and on 20 March a state of epidemic was announced. However, although medical students were pulled off from the hospital's medical universities in the country, many universities started encouraging future healthcare professionals to volunteer. Consequently, although they faced concerns about their health and education, thousands of Polish students from the faculties of Medicine, Pharmacy and Health Sciences have supported the fight against the coronavirus pandemic and engaged in voluntary service in local hospitals, sanitary-epidemiological stations, emergency units, hospital pharmacies, the university's diagnostic laboratory and local call centers, and soon most places were filled by volunteers and many other students are still waiting for their turn. This is of key importance, because in many countries, i.e., Italy or Spain, the healthcare systems reached a breaking point and have been seriously burdened by the COVID-19 pandemic and the struggle with insufficient medical personnel. Moreover, while the media has publish many distressing images of ill and dead people in various European countries, Poland has difficulty in retaining its health professionals and has the lowest number of physicians per 100,000 inhabitants in the European Union, and the number of practicing nurses in the country is also one of the lowest in the EU (1). (2), it is healthcare professionals that are at the increased risk of being infected as 17% of those infected are health professionals; near 4,000 medics were infected (including 986 physicians, 2 393 nurses, 212 midwifes, 89 dentists, 75 laboratory diagnosticians, 68 paramedics and 64 pharmacists), 31 077 were quarantined (8 881 physicians, 18 495 nurses, 1 644 midwifes, 824 dentists, 674 pharmacists, 451 laboratory diagnosticians and 108 paramedics), 678 were hospitalized (398 nurses, 194 physicians, 31 paramedics, 27 midwifes, 12 dentists, eight pharmacists and five laboratory diagnosticians) and 13 have died (seven physicians, six nurses) (3). Thus, although some countries asked medical students to step down, this is not the first time when future health professionals serve at the frontline of the battle with the pandemic (4, 5) . Not surprisingly, medical, nursing, midwifery, physiotherapy and pharmacy students have adapted to many new roles and help in administrative and office work, in emergency rooms and hospital wards, interview patients, care for outpatients through telemedicine, translate English texts about COVID-19, help with making supplies of personal protective equipment, sew protective masks or provide child care for healthcare workers. At the same time, while some theories concerning volunteering focus on personal motives and emphasize rational action and a cost-benefit analysis, others stress the role of accessible social resources such as organizational activity and social ties (6, 7). However, researchers have also investigated the contextual effects on volunteering and have paid attention to the impact of organizational, community and regional characteristics on individual decisions to volunteer (8, 9). Moreover, it is often argued that volunteerism has much in common with social activism and that both types of collective engagement are not so much initiated by the state or by political professionals but by collectives who act together for a common and specific purpose (10, 11) . Indeed, in response to the crisis situation caused by the COVID-19 outbreak, Poznan University of Medical Sciences (PUMS), in collaboration with university's student organizations, initiated a COVID-19 student volunteering project. And while students who joined the project were offered various compensations, including credits for a compulsory internship or flexible assessment of e-learning outcomes, the project itself emphasized that nurturance and care for others were deeply embedded in the role of health professionals. Nevertheless, many scholars argue that the nature of volunteering is being restructured and that volunteers' motivations are changing as the old or traditional forms of volunteering (long-term, based on membership, inspired by altruistic values and the importance of social interactions and connected to religious or political communities) are being replaced by the modern type of volunteering (project-oriented, based on career development and personal growth and not rooted in a local community) (12-16). Thus, while some studies have described the knowledge and attitudes toward the COVID-19 among medical students (17, 18) , this study focuses on students' experience of the pandemic and describes their experience with voluntary service during the COVID-19 pandemic. It also analyses the reasons behind the future healthcare professionals' involvement in voluntary service during the COVID-19 outbreak in Poland. ",

An online questionnaire which was posted on an online platform was used. The process of elaborating the questionnaire followed the guidelines of the European Statistical System (19) . The questionnaire consisted of four main sections: students' experience of the pandemic, students' experience with voluntary service during the COVID-19 outbreak, the reasons students' became involved in voluntary service, and socio-demographics. It was reviewed by a panel of experts and revised based on their comments. The final version of the questionnaire was approved by the University Student Council Board (USCB). All the participants received an invitation letter and informed consent was obtained from all individuals included in the study. The results are presented as descriptive statistics.",

Of this group, 417 students (56.3%) completed the questionnaire. Our group consisted of 301 females and 116 males ( Table 1) , representing all degree courses and years of study, but most of them, 256 (61.4%), were students of the medical faculty, which is the most numerous. The majority of volunteers 300 (71.9%) had various types of volunteer experience before the pandemic, and 72 (17.3%) had been volunteers more than 10 times. The main feelings evoked by the coronavirus outbreak in our respondents were fear over their loved ones (65.5%) and the willingness to act (59.7%) ( Table 2) . Simultaneously, the vast majority of students (87%) believed that the control measures imposed by the authorities were justified.

Even though some students stepped up for more individualistic and career reasons, i.e., they hoped that their voluntary service will help them to gain new knowledge and skills, develop their personal career or allow them to pass their summer internships, many others did so to fulfill the calling that the healthcare profession entails. This supports the observation made by Gage and Thapa (15) who argue that students' volunteerism is mostly driven by their desire to help others and expand their character. Thus, it seems that while for many students r\u00e9sum\u00e9 building and gaining new knowledge and skills was somehow important, it was rather an additional benefit and not a prime motivation (16). On the contrary, as most students were more driven by the ethical imperative to serve their community, healthcare professionals and their patients, they stepped forward out of a sense of civic responsibility, believed that the healthcare service is a unique vocation and that as future health professionals it was their duty to engage and help, whatever the risk (4, 5) .",

            "text": "Of course, our study does have its limitations. First, as we analyzed responses from students from only one medical university in the country, the study has a local dimension. Consequently, it would be desirable to compare the findings from other medical universities. However, to the best of our knowledge, no research on students' volunteering during the COVID-19 pandemics at other Polish universities has been done. Moreover, we believe that because this is a pilot study, it may stimulate further research on students' voluntary work during the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, although the response rate was moderately high, the results represent only the opinions of students who agreed to participate in the study and cannot be generalized for the entire student population either in Poznan or in Poland. Third, non-random sampling is another limitation as it prevented an analysis of the socio-demographic, structural and socio-cultural background of the issues discussed in our research. Finally, as this study is based on the quantitative method only, to understand better students' motivations, opinions and lived experiences, further in-depth studies using qualitative methods would be required. Nevertheless, we believe that as this is the first study on students' voluntary service during a coronavirus pandemic in Poland, it may stimulate further research on the topic.",
