Here, we implement an original virtual screening (VS) protocol for repositioning approved drugs in order to predict which of them could inhibit the main protease of the virus (M-pro), a key target for antiviral drugs given its essential role in the virus' replication. Two different libraries of approved drugs were docked against the structure of M-pro using Glide, FRED and AutoDock Vina, and only the equivalent high affinity binding modes predicted simultaneously by the three docking programs were considered to correspond to bioactive poses. In this way, we took advantage of the three sampling algorithms to generate hypothetic binding modes without relying on a single scoring function to rank the results. Seven possible SARS-CoV-2 M-pro inhibitors were predicted using this approach: Perampanel, Carprofen, Celecoxib, Alprazolam, Trovafloxacin, Sarafloxacin and ethyl biscoumacetate. Carprofen and Celecoxib have been selected by the COVID Moonshot initiative for in vitro testing; they show 3.97 and 11.90% M-pro inhibition at 50 \u00b5M, respectively.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The recently worldwide pandemic named COVID-19 (COronaVIrus Disease 2019) has spread rapidly since it emerged in Wuhan (China) in December 2019.

Domains I and II share the same fold (an antiparallel six-stranded \u03b2-barrel structure), whereas domain III is formed by five \u03b1-helices arranged into a largely antiparallel globular cluster. Domains II and III are connected by a long loop formed by residues from 185 to 198. The substrate-binding site of M-pro is located at a cleft between domains I and II, whereas domain III is involved in regulating M-pro dimerization through an intersubunit saltbridge between Glu290 (from one protomer) and Arg4 (from the other protomer) [8] . The formation of this dimer is essential for M-pro activity because the N-terminal residue of one protomer (i.e., Ser1) interacts with the Glu166 of the other, and thus, helps to form the S1 subsite of the substrate-binding pocket [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 127, "end": 130, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 873, "end": 876, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1113, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 124, "text": "Figure 1A", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Structural Description of M-Pro and Report of Known Mutations in its Structure"}, {"text": "The enzyme has a catalytic dyad formed by His41 and Cys145.

This figure was obtained with the help of the Maestro program [24] . Many M-pro structures have been recently deposited at the PDB (see Table S1 ). The first M-pro structure that was delivered by the PDB was 6LU7 [9] and, therefore, this has been the PDB file of choice for the different VS papers or structure-based drug designs reported that do not use homology models [5, 12, 21, 25, 26] . Figure 2 shows that when 6LU7 is superposed to 6W63 (M-pro bound to a noncovalent inhibitor) or to 6M03 (free enzyme), only minor structural changes affect the binding site structure: (a) Met49/Arg188 (S 2 subsite) and Met165/Gln189 (S 3 subsite) show totally different conformations of their sidechains (while keeping Met49 and Arg188 main chains coincident); (b) all the residues at the S 3 subsite, Pro168 and Ala191 have their main chain slightly displaced in one or in all three structures; and (c) Ser1 and Asn142 (S 1 subsite) show a slight change affecting the end of their side chains. When the coordinates of all of these residues are compared to their corresponding electron density map (EDM), all of them are correctly modeled, except for Gln189 from 6M03/6W63 and Met165 from 6M03. Then, given that the modeling of the binding site residues relative to the EDM is better in 6LU7 than in 6M03 or 6W63, we performed all our protein-ligand docking runs with 6LU7 as the target structure. Moreover, considering that: (1) our structural analysis has shown that the M-pro binding site has very limited flexibility; (2) the most flexible residues are Met49/Arg188 (S 2 subsite) and Met165/Gln189 (S 3 subsite); (3) the S 1 ' pocket is rigid; and (4) in the S 1 subsite changes only slightly at the end of the Ser1 and Asn142 side chains; we have decided that the receptor binding site will be considered as rigid in all the protein-ligand docking runs performed in this work, and that it will only be considered to be flexible when performing a Molecular Mechanics Generalized Born model and Solvent Accessibility (MM-GBSA) calculation to minimize the hit poses that succeed in the VS workflow.

Glide, FRED and AutoDock Vina follow different approaches to generate docked poses and score the results. Glide and FRED use different exhaustive algorithms to obtain docked poses, while AutoDock Vina uses an iterated local search global optimizer [28, 29] . Regarding their scoring functions, while the Glide and FRED scoring functions are fully empirical [30, 31] , the scoring function of AutoDock Vina is a hybrid scoring function that incorporates empirical and knowledge-based elements [32] . Because of the differences between these three protein-ligand docking programs, both in their search algorithms and scoring functions, focusing on their intersection should compensate for their individual weaknesses [33, 34] . With this in mind, we designed a VS (see Figure 4 ) that consisted of the following three steps: (1) performing independent protein-ligand docking simulations with Glide, FRED and AutoDock Vina; (2) identifying equivalent docked poses among the three docking programs (referred to as triplets for simplicity); and (3) applying a docking score threshold to consider as VS hits only the equivalent docked poses with high affinity for M-pro. Then, if at least one of the three equivalent poses that form a triplet has a higher positive docking score than the corresponding threshold value, then this triplet is removed from the VS hits list. Also, if more than one triplet was found for the same hit, the one that presented the highest mean docking score was chosen. Finally, the Glide pose of each VS hit triplet was submitted to an energy minimization with the binding site of M-pro by using the MM-GBSA minimization available at Prime [35] .

Perampanel is an AMPA glutamate receptor antagonist used as an anticonvulsant to treat partial-onset seizures (see Table 4 ). Docking and energy minimization predict that Perampanel can interact with several residues of the S 3 , S 2 , S 1 , and S 1 ' subsites (see Table 5 ). In the predicted binding mode, its 2-pyridyl group effect hydrophobic interactions with Met165, Met49, Asp187 and His41 whereas the main chain oxygen of His164 establishes a hydrogen bond interaction with some hydrogen atoms from the 2-pyridyl ring (which should anchor the ligand to this pocket in a similar fashion to cocrystallized inhibitors; see Table 5 and Figure 5A ). The 2-pyridyl group also effects a \u03c0 stacking interaction with His41, further increasing the affinity of this substructure for this subpocket. Perampanel also establishes a hydrogen bond interaction with Gly143 close to the catalytic site, which is observed for all cocrystallized ligands (see Table 2 ). In a similar way to 13b, N3 and X77, Perampanel also establishes a hydrogen bond between hydrogens of one of its aromatic rings (i.e., the phenyl ring) and the main chain oxygen of Thr26. Finally, Leu141 uses its main chain oxygen in a hydrogen bond with the 2-cyanophenyl aromatic ring. This latter hydrogen bond is not present in the cocrystallized inhibitors (see Table 2 ) and, together with the one established by Thr26, helps to anchor Perampanel outside the hydrophobic pocket. Unfortunately, this drug presents severe side effects such as serious or life-threatening behavioral and psychiatric reactions. Considering these adverse effects, the risk-benefit ratio of this treatment option should be evaluated for COVID-19 patients at different stages of the disease after having confirmed its in vitro activity against M-pro.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 560, "end": 564, "text": "[28,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 565, "end": 568, "text": "29]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 669, "end": 673, "text": "[30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 674, "end": 677, "text": "31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 804, "end": 808, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1027, "end": 1031, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1032, "end": 1035, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1977, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 2590, "end": 2599, "text": "Figures 5", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1079, "end": 1087, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": "FIGREF7"}, {"start": 2213, "end": 2220, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 2418, "end": 2426, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 2695, "end": 2704, "text": "Figure 6D", "ref_id": "FIGREF11"}, {"start": 3342, "end": 3349, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 3569, "end": 3577, "text": "Figure 5", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 3750, "end": 3765, "text": "Figures 5 and 6", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 3871, "end": 3880, "text": "Figure 6D", "ref_id": "FIGREF11"}, {"start": 4416, "end": 4423, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 4567, "end": 4574, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4929, "end": 4936, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4941, "end": 4950, "text": "Figure 5A", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 5248, "end": 5255, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}, {"start": 5626, "end": 5633, "text": "Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF1"}], "section": "Virtual Screening of Approved Drugs"}, {"text": "Carprofen is a selective cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor that was previously used as a pain reliever in the treatment of joint and postsurgical pain (see Table 4 ). In the binding site of M-pro, the minimized docked pose of Carprofen also occupies the hydrophobic pocket, effecting hydrophobic interactions with the residues Gln189, Met49, Asp187 and His41, and a hydrogen bond interaction with the main chain oxygen of His164. Moreover, its chloro group is able to establish a halogen bond interaction with the thiol group of the residue Cys44, which is present at the end of this subpocket, and a hydrophobic interaction with its side-chain CB atom (see Table 5 and Figure 5B ). The ring system at the core of the compound is also predicted to effect a \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with His41. Carprofen also makes two additional hydrogen bonds with the main chain nitrogen atoms from Ser144 and Cys145 (while the former is not found in cocrystallized M-pro inhibitors, the latter has been described for 13a and 13b). According to the DrugBank database [36] , this drug was withdrawn from the market in 1995 on commercial grounds. Carprofen was previously used in human medicine for over 10 years, and is approved for use in dogs. Regarding its adverse effects, Carprofen was generally well tolerated with mild adverse effects, i.e., similar to those of aspirin and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). However, NSAIDs increase the risk of cardiotoxicity [37] and may worsen the course of community-acquired pneumonia [38] . Recent bioactivity data obtained for this compound by the COVID Moonshot initiative shows that Carprofen has limited inhibition capacity on SARS-CoV-2 M-pro (3.97% inhibition at 50 \u00b5M; see Table 4 ) and, therefore, could be used as a lead compound for the development of more potent inhibitors. Table 5 . Summary of the intermolecular interactions between M-pro and the seven compounds that we identified as putative M-pro inhibitors. These interactions were obtained with the poseviewer_interactions.py script after the Glide poses and the M-pro binding site were submitted to a MM-GBSA minimization. Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor indicated for arthritis pain and to reduce precancerous polyps in the colon in familial adenomatous polyposis (see Table 4 ). The minimized docked pose of Celecoxib at the M-pro binding site places its hydrophobic trifluoromethyl group in the hydrophobic pocket, although only a hydrophobic interaction with Met49 is reflected in Table 5 , possibly due to the smaller size of this substituent compared to those in the previous two compounds (see Figure 5C ). Interestingly, the 4-sulfamoylphenyl group of this compound is predicted to occupy the S 1 subsite and establish a hydrogen bond interaction with Asn142, which is also present in the cocrystallyzed complex structure with X77, as well as a hydrogen bond interaction with Leu141. Because of the anti-inflammatory actions of COX-2 inhibitors, the combination of an immunomodulatory agent, such as a thalidomide, and an anti-inflammatory agent, such as Celecoxib, has been suggested as a possible treatment of patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia [39] . Although significant concerns regarding the safety of COX-2 selective NSAIDs emerged in the early 2000s, in 2005, the FDA concluded that the benefits of Celecoxib treatment outweighed the potential risks for properly selected and informed patients [40] . However, it is not advisable to administer Celecoxib or other NSAIDs to patients with previous cardiovascular events including acute myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or coronary stent insertion [41] , and NSAIDs may worsen the course of community-acquired pneumonia [38] . Recent bioactivity data obtained for this compound by the COVID Moonshot initiative shows that Celecoxib has better inhibition capacity on SARS-CoV-2 M-pro than Carprofen (11.90% inhibition at 50\u00b5M; see Table 4 ) and it could also be used as a lead compound for the development of more potent inhibitors (for instance, by improving the capacity of its analogs to establish better interactions with the hydrophobic pocket at the S 3 and the S 2 subsites or with S 1 ').", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1045, "end": 1049, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1463, "end": 1467, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1526, "end": 1530, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 3181, "end": 3185, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 3436, "end": 3440, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 3655, "end": 3659, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 3727, "end": 3731, "text": "[38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 164, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 659, "end": 666, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 671, "end": 680, "text": "Figure 5B", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 1722, "end": 1729, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1835, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2291, "end": 2298, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}, {"start": 2506, "end": 2513, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2622, "end": 2631, "text": "Figure 5C", "ref_id": "FIGREF9"}, {"start": 3937, "end": 3944, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF5"}], "section": "Virtual Screening of Approved Drugs"}, {"text": "Alprazolam acts on the receptors BNZ-1 and BNZ-2 and is used for the treatment of anxiety and panic disorders (see Table 4 ).
