To address this gap, the current study conducted a latent profile analysis (LPA) to obtain evidence-based information regarding employees' sense of inclusion in their organizations. Using a sample of 1,168 participants engaged in multiple industries in China, we identified three profiles of inclusion, with a largest proportion feeling a moderate level of inclusion (69.5%), a smaller proportion feeling a high level of inclusion (22.7%), and a tiny proportion feeling a low level of inclusion (7.8%). The three profiles differ significantly on key variables, demonstrating that the group feeling more included tends to be more aged and tenured, hold a higher educational degree, work in the hightech sector, and come from a developed area. Such a group also shows more engagement in their work but less exhaustion, feels that they have more opportunities for development, and gains more support from colleagues and supervisors. Our findings point to the existence of subgroups of inclusion within the Chinese context and highlight the characteristics of these profiles, which in turn shed lights on how we can reach the goal of inclusion.",

Although these findings are meaningful and provocative, however, the inclusion typologies are needed to be investigated further as the number and meaning of profiles depend greatly upon sample characteristics and assessment tools (Jason and Glenwick, 2016; Wang et al., 2020) . The tool used in their study was the 15-item scale developed by Mor , which measures the decision-making process, information networks, and one's level of participation, and is more indicative of the causes of inclusion rather than evaluating one's sense of inclusion per se. Meanwhile, the sample was small with only 213 participants, and from a single source focusing only on public organizations. The lack of representative sample in their study limited the validation of the profiles.",

The 10-item Work Group Inclusion Scale, with five items measuring belongingness and five items measuring uniqueness, perfectly aligns with the established definition of inclusion comprising belongingness and uniqueness (Shore et al., 2011) . This measure is expected to demonstrate the profiles of inclusion better. Furthermore, a representative sample is crucial to the validation of the profiles obtained. An LPA using larger sample with participants coming from various organizations and engaging in different professions is more likely to generate a more robust classification. Importantly, the Chinese culture is characterized by high collectivism (Hofstede, 1980) , conformity (Goncalo and Staw, 2006) , and harmony orientation derived from the dominant Confucian values (Leung et al., 2002; Kang et al., 2017; Horak and Yang, 2019) . It is not thought to be as diverse as the Western contexts (Cho and Mor Barak, 2008) . In this regard, conducing an LPA in such a situation can potentially extend the previous studies grounded in the Western context and identify unique profiles pertinent to the Chinese culture. Therefore, our pilot study contributes to the existing research by identifying the patterns of inclusion in a non-Western context with a more representative sample and providing a more in-depth understanding of inclusion profiles by using a more valid measure of inclusion, subsequently shedding new light on how we can establish an inclusive workplace.",

With these three indices, a lower model value is indicative of a better fit. We also used Entropy to assess the quality of the classifications, where a value higher than 0.80 suggests that the accuracy of the classification was over 90% (Lubke and Muth\u00e9n, 2007) . We also performed the Lo-Mendell-Rubin Test (LMR; Lo et al., 2001) and the Bootstrap Likelihood Ratio Test (BLRT; McLachlan and Peel, 2004) , with significant LMR and BLRT results (p < 0.05) indicating that the specified k-profile solution was significantly better than the k-1 profile solution (Nylund et al., 2007) . In addition, the average probabilities of class membership were also considered. If the derived model with the average probabilities of all classes was higher than 0.80, this was considered to be an acceptable fit (Vermunt and Magidson, 2002) . As these indices are sometimes contradictory, we also depicted elbow plots of BIC to examine where the curve flattened to determine the optimal classifications. Finally, as identified patterns and profiles should be interpretable in theory (Nylund et al., 2007; Marsh et al., 2009; Neely-Barnes, 2010) , we examined the substantive meanings for each class once the optimal model was identified, and then named them correspondingly to offer an abstract description of each class.",

Class 3 (22.7%) was characterized by relatively high scores on each item, was thus named the high inclusion group. Although the remaining class (Class 1) accounted for only a small proportion of our sample (7.8%), it was a meaningful class with scores on all items being the lowest, thus was correspondingly named the low inclusion group. Table 5 summarizes the DCAT and modified BCH results of the overall chi-square tests and chi-square statistics for pairwise comparisons between classes (N = 1,168) for the categorical and continuous outcome variables. As shown in Table 5 , all comparisons on the external variables involved across the three subgroups were significant, with the exception of gender. Specifically, those in the high inclusion group for development (M = 3.971, SE = 0.056), support from colleagues (M = 1.959, SE = 0.115) and supervisor (M = 1.965, SE = 0.094) while most likely to be exhaustion (M = 4.576, SE = 0.115). Finally, those in the moderate inclusion group (Class 2) tended to work in the service industry (52.4%, SE = 0.018) and come from moderately developed areas (26.4%, SE = 0.016). They exhibited a moderate level on all other foci variables.",

These differentiations pertinent to educational attainment, industry, and regional origins across the three profiles could be due to the inequality resulting from the household registration system in China (the Hukou system). As a dominant means of managing population mobility, the Hukou system has caused the \"rural-urban\" divisions, determining one's eligibility for certain state-provided services and welfare programs pertaining to education and employment, among others (Liu, 2005; Chan, 2010; Afridi et al., 2015) . Those who are well educated are then more likely to get better jobs in prosperous industries. In such an institutional arrangement, members from less developed areas usually hold a rural status with fewer educational and employment opportunities, thus leading to a lower level of perceived inclusion in the workplace.

This could be ascribed to the seniority-based system embedded in Confucian ideals in China (Kang et al., 2017; Horak and Yang, 2019) . In this type of social setting, juniors (inferiors) are expected to follow, obey, and respect their seniors (superiors; Cho and Mor Barak, 2008) , and these seniors are thus more likely to feel higher inclusion in their organizations. In our study, the most majority of participants were juniors with younger ages (M = 26.77, SD = 3.09) and shorter job tenures (M = 4.71, SD = 2.33). As such, it could be that they currently are less likely to feel as respected and valued as their seniors, experiencing fewer wage increases and/ or less career growth as their older, more tenured colleagues (Horak and Yang, 2019) . Accordingly, they may not feel a higher sense of inclusion that comes through seniority, even though the majority do already experience a moderate sense of being included in their organizations. Similarly, those perceiving a high degree of inclusion (i.e., Class 3) tended to be relatively older and hold longer tenure in our study. As expected, we verified that there were substantial and regular differences on distal outcome variables across the three profiles by showing that the group with a higher level of inclusion engaged more in work, perceived more opportunity for development, support from colleagues, and support from supervisor, while also experiencing less exhaustion. This result is consistent with previous studies that have suggested that a greater sense of inclusion is associated with more positive outcomes (Nishii, 2013; Hwang and Hopkins, 2015; Dwertmann and Boehm, 2016; Shore et al., 2018) and less negative outcomes (Nishii, 2013; Brimhall et al., 2014; Dwertmann and Boehm, 2016) . The findings of the current study therefore support the significance of inclusion in the workplace.",

Furthermore, while more than half of the sample belonged to the high inclusion subgroup in previous study (Brimhall and Saastamoinen, 2020) , the majority in our study were found to be positioned in the moderate inclusion subgroup (69.5%), with a much smaller proportion (22.7%) were categorized into the high inclusion subgroup, and the low inclusion subgroup accounting for only a tiny proportion of the sample (7.8%).

Second, our results different from those of the previous study imply that the measures used to assess inclusion may matter. For our study, we adopted the 10-item scale developed by Chung et al. (2020) , which fits well with the academic definition of inclusion that includes belongingness and uniqueness, while Brimhall and Saastamoinen (2020) applied the 15-item scale developed by Mor that focuses on the decision-making process, information networks, and one's level of participation.

It is worth noting that the majority of the respondents in our study were younger than 40 years old. This may be attributed to the fact that the older employees are less embracing the digital tools than their younger peers, and thus more reluctant to participate in our survey through Wechat. Future research should seek to broaden the representativeness of the sample to cover more different age groups, professions, or regions to achieve more robust conclusions.",

Our findings suggest the uniqueness of these inclusion profiles pertaining to the Chinese context and confirm the importance of inclusion by revealing substantial differences across the subgroups on key variables. Through the use of the Work Group Inclusion Scale, this study also offers insights into how we can cultivate an inclusive workplace and ensure all member are included, that is, by striving to fulfill individuals' needs for belongingness and uniqueness.
