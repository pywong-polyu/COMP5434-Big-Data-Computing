Yet, large missed opportunities remain in nutrition service delivery. This paper examines how well evidence-based MNIs were incorporated in national policies and programs in Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and India. We compared the nutrition content of ANC protocols against global recommendations. We used survey data to elucidate the coverage of micronutrient supplementation, weight gain monitoring, dietary and breastfeeding counselling. We reviewed literature, formative research and program assessments to identify barriers and enabling factors of service provision and maternal nutrition practices. Nutrition information in national policies and protocols was often fragmented, incomplete and did not consistently follow global recommendations. Nationally representative data on MNIs in ANC was inadequate, except for iron and folic acid supplementation. Coverage data from subnational surveys showed similar patterns of strengths and weaknesses.",

Findings from 81 LMICs estimate that if health systems could effectively deliver a subset of evidence-based interventions to mothers and their newborns who are already seeking care, there would be a 28% decline in maternal and neonatal deaths, and 22% decrease in stillbirths (Chou et al., 2019) . Despite this evidence, the coverage of nutrition interventions is far lower than the reach of their associated health service platforms . In India (UP state), only half of pregnant women who attended ANC reported consuming iron and folic acid (IFA), and substantially fewer women initiated breastfeeding within one hour after delivery, as compared with the proportion of women who delivered in health facilities (Nguyen et al., 2021) .",

Before the publication of the WHO ANC guidelines in 2016, nutrition interventions received little priority in ANC services. Thus, there is scarce evidence on the content, quality, and factors associated with maternal nutrition interventions (MNIs) during ANC (Benova et al., 2018; Torlesse et al., 2021) , other than IFA supplementation (Kavle & Landry, 2018; Sanghvi et al., 2010; Sununtnasuk et al., 2016) . This paper provides details on the package of four MNIs as part of ANC in two sub-Saharan and two South Asian countries (Bangladesh, Burkina Faso, Ethiopia and India). Specifically, we (1) elucidate the content of national policies and protocols on micronutrient supplementation, weight gain monitoring, and counselling on maternal diet and breastfeeding, (2) examine service delivery gaps in MNIs during ANC, and (3) identify factors associated with delivery of MNIs and maternal nutrition practices.",

First, we conducted a desk review of maternal nutrition program and policy documents including ANC guidelines and protocols to identify nutrition contents in each country and compared these contents with the WHO ANC recommendations (WHO, 2016) . Then we conducted secondary data analysis of national and subnational surveys to determine coverage of services delivered by ANC providers and nutrition practices among pregnant women. Finally, we reviewed data from multiple sources (peer-reviewed publications, formative research reports and notes of stakeholder dialogues) to identify barriers and enabling factors that helped to explain the nutrition service delivery and maternal nutrition practices.

Building on our previous work on infant and young child feeding interventions (Menon, Nguyen, Saha, Khaled, Kennedy, et al., 2016; Sanghvi et al., 2016) , we expected that maternal nutrition practices would likely be influenced by individual and household factors including knowledge, self-efficacy, beliefs, access, and family support. Additionally, important community-level factors might influence the extent to which pregnant women adopt recommended practices include food taboos or misconceptions on diets (Lakshmi, 2013; Zerfu et al., 2016) and strong gendered social norms with low priority given to women's nutrition (ROSHNI, 2019).",

National surveys and routine monitoring data systems lacked process indicators needed for tracking nutrition interventions in ANC. Our findings align with global concerns on limited process monitoring indicators (Choufani et al., 2020; Gillespie et al., 2019; Heidkamp et al., 2021) . For micronutrients, we found that the number of doses distributed per woman and counseling provided are not routinely recorded. Most women are weighed during ANC visits according to survey data and formative research, but weight gain and weight gain counseling are not recorded. Other indicators such as counseling on maternal diet, breastfeeding counseling and obtaining the support of family members, are also missing. The lack of data highlights an apparent lack of priority and accountability for maternal nutrition in health services. Efficient planning and targeting of scarce resources cannot be achieved without data. Previous evidence has shown that ongoing cycles of problem-solving based on data and adjustments made in program delivery can improve worker performance (Bootwala, 2020) . Accountability is essential to ensure that global and country actions are delivered with quality and equity to make a difference.",

Nutrition interventions appeared to receive low priority among ANC services and there was lack of accountability for quality and coverage. ANC users in the countries experienced inadequate supplies of micronutrients and suboptimal counseling that was accompanied by limited community engagement, inconsistent record keeping and poor use of data by health staff.For addressing national policy gaps, we suggest the need for closer coordination between nutrition and maternal health units within Ministries of Health, continued sharing of new evidence and review of relevant country data, developing operational specifications with insights gained from other country examples, and agreement on streamlined tasks and tools for ANC staff to feasibly incorporate key elements of nutrition interventions. Nutrition protocols that are embedded in ANC and nutrition policies, strategies and directives need to be more specific and consolidated in readily accessible documents. With suitable global and national guidance and technical assistance, achieving alignment in protocols by nutrition and ANC teams is possible. Joint assessments of data needs and SANGHVI ET AL.Our study indicates the need for greater clarity in global maternal nutrition guidelines to facilitate country-specific adaptations. Examples include criteria and cut-off points for adopting routine calcium and multiple micronutrient supplementation in ANC, dietary counseling and support for healthy weight gain in women with varying BMI and health conditions (e.g., diabetes, hypertension), and evidence-based adherence strategies for micronutrient and dietary diversity protocols.",
