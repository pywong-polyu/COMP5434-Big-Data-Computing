More than five million cases and more than 300 000 deaths have been reported in May worldwide. 4 Several countries have adopted measures to limit virus spread, including lockdown, social distancing and reinforcement of hygiene requirements. Hospital activities have also been reorganised in order to reduce the risk of contagion among patients and caregivers.",

[9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] We aimed to assess how oncology centres and departments reacted to the health crisis related to the COVID-19 pandemic, in order to improve oncological care and to implement preventive measures.",

Although some legal and reimbursement issues remain, COVID-19 crisis has led to a rapid expansion of telemedicine, which could remain a good option also outside the pandemic crisis, especially when a clinical examination is not necessary and in areas of the world where reaching the hospital raises practical difficulties for patients. 21 Almost all the oncological centres included in the survey performed a triage before admission to the hospital in order to recognise symptoms early in suspected cases and to avoid contamination of other patients and healthcare professionals. Triage is supplemented with diagnostic tests, usually swab, with nasal sampling resulting more efficiently than throat sampling. 22 23 The main issue with this tool is the relatively low sensitivity of about 70%, the multiplicity of primers that can be used to perform the reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and the risk of cross-reactivity with other coronavirus strains. [24] [25] [26] Chest CT scan seems to be more sensitive than RT-PCR for COVID-19 diagnosis and in 60%-93% of the cases becomes positive before the RT-PCR. 25 27 However, the disadvantage of CT is the limited availability in terms of number of exams per day in each institution compared with the swab, which can be easily made on a large scale and is less cost-effective. On the other hand, the result of the swab test takes a longer time than CT scan. A potential solution to these concerns is the development of a rapid test, such as the serological test for IgA, IgM and IgG. Currently, its low sensitivity at the early phase of infection, the delayed and the lower rate of seroconversion in patients with cancer and the inability to detect contagiousness do not yet make it a suitable test to be used as a diagnostic standard. [28] [29] [30] Overall, at the moment, it seems more appropriate to carry out a triage by telephone or interactive platform before outpatient admissions and a swab before hospitalisation. While the use of screening by means of a swab prior to hospitalisation is increasing, there was no unanimous agreement about retesting. A single baseline test does not allow early detection of intrahospital infections and could miss paucisymptomatic or presymptomatic patients. 31 Another issue of concern is the implementation of a policy for return to work for healthcare professionals tested positive. While some centres require negative swab test, others do not, which may pose a risk of transmitting the infection at the workplace, considering that a duration of viral shedding up to 37 days has been described. 32 33 Finally, predisposed dedicated facilities to manage cancer care during COVID-19 pandemic could be advisable. 34 Although COVID-19 wards have been organised in most centres, in only 57.1% of the centres healthcare professionals caring for oncohaematological patients did not take part in the care of COVID-19-positive patients.",

Although some recommendations for hospital management during the COVID-19 pandemic are actually available, such as those of the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, our study allows assessment of adherence to this recommendation, in addition to providing an insight into the management of oncological care during the pandemic in a real-world context. 8 Many procedures adopted, in fact, require agreement at the international level. Some critical issues remain to be improved in order to increase the safety of treatment for oncohaematological patients. The same level of care should be extended to the entire healthcare system, to less well-supplied centres and to low-income countries. ",
