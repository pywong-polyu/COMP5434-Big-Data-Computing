Gender differences in attitudes towards digital health technology were non-significant (p > .05). Significant differences in frequency of use were also found, where occasional and frequent use resulted in more positive attitudes than never having used digital health technology (p < 0.05) and participants reporting frequent use were significantly older than those reporting never or occasional use (p < .05) Conclusion: Findings identified age, but not gender, as a significant factor in attitude towards digital health technology, suggesting that continued and increased reliance on digital technology in healthcare may lead to age, but not gender, related inequalities in access to healthcare in the UK. That frequent users of digital health technology were also older, highlights the greater demand for healthcare services by older individuals and is further evidence for the potential of digital healthcare to lead to age related inequalities in access to and provision of healthcare. Recommendations for successful application of digital healthcare technology are considered in the light of these findings.",

Technology's ongoing growth and development at an irrepressible rate has \"transformed the way we live, work and communicate\" (Maitland, 2012). Therefore we must embrace the growth of technology and advance with it in all areas of our lives. Health technology is defined as \"the application of organized knowledge and skills in the form of devices, medicines, vaccines, procedures and systems developed to solve a health problem and improve quality of lives\" (World Health Organization, 2017).The majority of technological advances so far in healthcare are mainly due to new opportunities created by the Internet that challenge traditional health care (Eysenbach, 2001), the impact of which continues to grow. Technology and its continued development offer great potential for increased efficiency for communication, even more so with advances in mobile communication and accessibility of mobile devices. A study conducted by The Office of Communications (Ofcom, 2016) showed that 93% of adults in the United Kingdom owned a mobile phone, 71% of those owned a smartphone, offering huge potential for the healthcare sector to exploit, and in doing so, revolutionise the way healthcare is delivered. Emerging Health Technologies AXA PPP Healthcare have published a recent report detailing a number of examples of work exploring the potential of digital healthcare technology (AXA PPP Healthcare, 2017).",

The AXA PPP Healthcare report goes on to refer to a study directed by the Hurley Group, London, which demonstrated the potential that digital health services offered.

Whilst it has no single unifying definition, perhaps because of its endless possibilities, Eyesenbach (2001) defines it as \"technical development, but also a state-of-mind, a way of thinking, an attitude, and a commitment for networked, global thinking, to improve health care locally, regionally, and worldwide by using information and communication technology\". The benefits of eHealth are noted by Eysenbach and include increased efficiency in health care and better quality of care. The presence of eHealth continues to grow globally within the healthcare sector, its benefits are becoming widely acknowledged, \"The findings suggest that Americans' believe that health IT adoption is an effective means to improve the quality and safety of health care.\" (Gaylin, Moiduddin, Mohamoud, Lundeen, & Kelly, 2011) . Chiron Health also refer to the proven value of telemedicine for individuals in assisted living facilities, where it allows doctors to manage cases by remote visits and determine if a hospitalisation is actually necessary (Chiron Health, 2017) . Telemedicine 2 is an example of a fast emerging digital health technology. It involves the remote diagnosis and treatment of patients by means of telecommunications technology which can \"speed up diagnoses, increase access to care for remote populations, reduce health care costs and even relieve physician shortages.\" (Parks, 2017) . Telemedicine is still in the early stages of development but has already been adopted worldwide by a number of health organisations to deliver efficient health care and exploit the associated economic benefits. For example, in America the cost of a telemedicine appointment is around \"$45 compared with approximately $100 for the same appointment in a doctor's office\" (Beck, 2016) . Recent statistics illustrate how this method of health care has already been widely adopted in America, with more than 15 million Americans receiving some kind 1 A relatively recent term for healthcare practice supported by electronic processes and communication. 2 \"Telemedicine allows health care professionals to evaluate, diagnose and treat patients at a distance using telecommunications technology.\" (Chiron Health, 2017) . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

Parks (2017) reports the findings of two survey studies that help demonstrate the extent to which technology is being used by health professionals to deliver healthcare services, the first, an MGMA Stat poll exploring if physicians will or currently offer telehealth services in 2017, found that almost 17 percent of the 1,325 respondents said that they already offer telemedicine services and a further 21 percent have plans to use the technology.\", and the second, telehealth Index survey from American Well, found that 57 percent of physicians are interested in seeing patients over video if clinically appropriate.

The 'principle of consistency' states that there is an expectation that a person's attitude and how they behave are consistent with each other (McLeod, 2014) . A study conducted by HealthMine to investigate telemedicine awareness, reported 39% of participants were not aware of telemedicine, with participants who had never used telemedicine, 42% preferred in-person doctor visits (Beck, 2016) . These findings illustrate how attitudes and awareness offer valuable insight into behavior, highlighting a barrier to the adoption of health technology, not just for users but also for providers. A survey containing 1500 family physicians established that only 15% of the practices had adopted telemedicine as part of their long term future strategy (Beck, 2016) , signifying that telemedicine has a long way to go before becoming a universally accepted and adopted health technology and highlighting the need for further research in the area of digital health technology adoption.",

There are relatively few technology adoption studies focussing specifically on digital health technology in the UK, but the ones there are suggest that, amongst a number of socioeconomic factors, age and gender may be major factors in the adoption of health technologies. Arning and Ziefle (2009) explored the role played by age and gender in the acceptance of health technology and found that older participants perceived higher 'utilization barriers' and reported higher concerns about data safety issues than younger participants. A 2015 Health Tech Nation Survey, conducted by AXA PPP Healthcare, confirmed increasing adoption of health technology but identified clear generational differences between attitudes to, and the adoption of, different types of health technology (AXA PPP Healthcare, 2017). Younger people seem keener to embrace 'big data' and demonstrate a belief that health technology can help with the management of long-term conditions (especially obesity, diabetes, cancer and heart disease), while those over 55 have more of a focus and interest in health monitoring devices. Kaushal, Ancker, Silver and Miller (2013) reported a relationship between age and attitudes towards health technologies, suggesting age as a potential barrier to digital health, \"Belief that EHR [Electronic Health Records] would improve healthcare quality was significantly more common among those under the age of 40 years than other age groups.\" Similar trends were found in the Care Innovations study which suggesting that \"People over 65 are traditionally less-experienced with technology when compared to younger adults, and most people over 65 show declines in perceptual, motor, and/or cognitive function that can interfere with their ability to use technologies.\" (Care Innovations, 2013).",

Statements represent the different components of attitudes, i.e., emotion, behaviour and cognition (McLeod, 2014) and the different aspects and issues that are relevant to the use of technology in health, including ease of use, reliability and privacy. Participants respond to each statement along a 5-point Likert scale (McLeod, 2008) from strongly agree to strongly disagree depending how much they agree or disagree with the statement. Example statements include 'I don't really understand how to use heath technology' and 'If I am ill, I prefer to look on the internet for help than go to the doctors'. A total DHS score is achieved by summing the scores of the 20 individual statements, giving a theoretical scoring range of 20-100.

Findings from the present study show a significant small to moderate negative correlation between age and attitude towards digital health. Older people therefore expressed a more negative attitude towards digital health. When occupation data was explored, retired people expressed a significantly more negative attitude towards digital health than both students and employed people. Assuming that retired people are generally older-the average age of retirement in the UK for males is 65 years and 64 years for females (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, 2017)-this further supports the association between age and attitude towards digital health. Age and use of digital health were also explored to investigate which age group used digital health most frequently. Findings showed that the group reporting using digital health frequently were significantly older than those reporting using it occasionally or never using it, supporting the suggestion that older people have a greater demand for healthcare services (Mortimer & Green, 2015) so are increasingly having to use digital health as the main, or only, way to access services. These findings are in line with a number of existing general technology and health technology studies. For example, a German study exploring the acceptance of technology in relation to age, concluded that older participants tended to feel \"intimidated by these new health-technologies, as they cannot appraise the consequences of using these devices for their living context\" (Arning & Ziefle, 2009) , suggesting how older people feel uncomfortable when using technology.

This adds extra emphasis to the need to ensure that older people, in particular, develop an increasingly positive attitude towards digital health. Analysis of reported usage data in the present study revealed that those reporting frequent and occasional use of digital health reported a significantly more positive attitude towards digital health than those who never use digital health. This finding is supported by other studies that report usage as a significant factor in attitudes towards and adoption of technology, including Gaylin et al. (2011) and McGillicuddy, et al. (2013) , who both reported similar findings suggesting that individuals who use digital health technology more, and have more experience with digital health technology, demonstrate a more positive attitude towards digital health when compared to those who use it on a less frequent basis. Similar trends are reported in the present data Thus, it seems providing opportunities for individuals, particularly older people and those likely to avoid using digital health, is likely to help develop a more positive attitude towards digital health and lead to increased adoption of digital health. This has already been demonstrated in general technology studies, where technology educations programmes had a positive effect on attitudes towards technology (Bowser & Daugherty, 1998) .",

Older individuals expressed a more negative attitude towards health technology. There is a strong association between attitude and behaviour, as demonstrated in a number of technology adoption studies (e.g. Kaushal et al., 2013) . Thus, the suggestion that age may be a barrier to access to healthcare, leading to a potential public health risk around inequality in health care, is worth further consideration. This is particularly important given the aging population in the UK who are likely to have a greater demand for health service provision (Government Office for Science, 2016; Green, 2015) . Older individuals may be unable to, or unwilling to, access these healthcare services if, as seems to be the growing and irreversible trend (Parks, 2017) , they are delivered via technology-based platforms. The study did provided evidence that older, retired people reported more frequent use of digital health technology than younger, student and employed people. This suggests that healthcare services already rely heavily on technology and the greater demand for these services by older people.

The study also provided evidence that people who reported more frequent use of digital health technology also expressed a more positive attitude towards digital health than those who reported never having used digital health technology. This is a common finding in technology adoption studies exploring general technology, where increased use of technology and technology education programmes altered attitudes towards technology (Bowser & Daugherty, 1998; Lukow, 2005) .
