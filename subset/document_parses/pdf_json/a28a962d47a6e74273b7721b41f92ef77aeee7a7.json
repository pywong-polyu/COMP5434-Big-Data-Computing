            "text": "Background: High blood pressure is the leading cause of cardiovascular disease worldwide. The prevalence of high blood pressure is steadily rising as the population grows amongst older adults with the ageing population. Therapeutical treatments are widely available to decrease blood pressures, in addition to many lifestyle options, such as dietary changes and exercise. There is a marked preference amongst patients, as reiterated by Hypertension Canada, for more research into non-therapeutic methods for controlling blood pressure or to reduce the burden of taking many pills to control high blood pressure. Indeed, effective options do exist, especially with diet, specifically decreasing sodium and increasing potassium intake. Current public health outreach primarily focusses on sodium intake, even though potassium intake remains low in the Western world. Excellent data exist in published research that increasing potassium intake, either via dietary modification or supplements, reduces blood pressure and reduces risk of cardiovascular outcomes such as stroke. However, the advice most often provided by medical professionals is to 'eat more fruits and vegetables' which has little impact on patient outcomes. Methods: We propose to do a clinical trial in two stages with an adaptive trial design. In the first stage, participants with high blood pressure and proven low potassium intake (measured on the basis of a 24-h urine collection) will get individually tailored dietary advice, reinforced by weekly supportive phone/email support. At 4 weeks, if there has not been a measured increase in potassium intake, participants will be prescribed an additional potassium supplement. Testing will be conducted again at 8 weeks, to confirm the efficacy of the potassium supplement. Final measurements will be planned at 52 weeks to observe and measure the persistence of the effect of diet or additional supplement. Concurrent measurements of sodium intake, blood pressure, participant satisfaction, and safety measures will also be done.",

Apart from a wide choice of pharmacological agents, multiple lifestyle modifications, in particular an increase in potassium intake by diet or as a supplement, have been shown to be efficacious in reducing blood pressure (BP) [1] [2] [3] . An increase in dietary potassium is recommended by the World Health Organization [4] , the American Heart Association/ American College of Cardiology [5] , and Hypertension Canada [6, 7] . Despite this, potassium intake remains stubbornly low in western world, including in Canada. Similar to the relative slowness in behaviour change with reducing sodium, the reason why trials of efficacy may not have translated into change is that the interventions in the trials of dietary modification have not been feasible (including supervised intake of meals and/or provision of meals) to be used in clinical practice. In contrast to behavioural modification required for increasing potassium intake in food, namely change in dietary habits, addition of potassium supplements might be an easy to implement alternative [8, 9] . The advocacy of potassium supplements has not made it into any guidelines despite robust data of their efficacy and the public enthusiasm for consuming health supplements.",

The effect of increasing potassium on BP is seen at low as well as high sodium intake, for example in the Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension Sodium (DASH Sodium) trial, the effect of the potassium rich DASH diet was \u2212 5.0/\u2212 2.5 mm Hg at high sodium intake and \u2212 2.2/\u2212 1.0 at low sodium intake [11] . Increasing dietary potassium intake has an inverse association not just with BP but can impact cardiovascular disease. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on the effect of increased potassium intake on BP show significant decreases in systolic and diastolic BP with increased potassium intake [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Globally, hypertension is the leading risk factor for mortality, accounting for 13% of death, and also being the leading cause of disability worldwide, according to the Global Burden of Disease studies [14] [15] [16] . Research on lifestyle habits to reduce blood pressure, without involving pharmacotherapy has been identified as a top research priority by Hypertension Canada [1] .",

Thus, increasing potassium intake, as part of the diet or as a supplement, has little adverse effects in most populations [9, 13] . In this adaptive trial, we will test the effectiveness of dietary counselling, followed by additional potassium supplementation in those in whom dietary counselling is ineffective.

Focused and individualized dietary counselling to increase potassium intake will be the initial intervention amongst hypertensive individuals with low potassium intake. The aim of the study is to find the most effective intervention to increase potassium intake in this population. Since diet is the only recommendation in current clinical practice guidelines, this will be the initial intervention. Only in participants who do not achieve an increase in potassium intake, as measured on the basis of her 24-h urine potassium, as described below, will a potassium supplement be added. From a safety perspective, this was thought to be the most suitable study design. A comparison of a potassium supplement with a diet might result in a change in diet in patients randomized to a supplement, with possible safety issues in terms of hyperkalemia.

Twenty four-hour urinary sodium and creatinine (to assess for accuracy of collection) will also be measured for all participants at baseline, 4 weeks, and 52 weeks (end of study). In addition, participants who enrol into stage 2 will have an additional 24-h urinary collection and set of measurements at 4 weeks after initiation of the potassium supplement/dose escalation. Blood will also be collected at the same time points for measurement of kidney function and electrolytes (creatinine, sodium, potassium, total CO 2 , chloride). As an additional safety measure, serum potassium will be measured 1 week after starting potassium supplementation, 1 week after dose escalation, and 1 week post each re-dispensing visit. Blood pressure will be measured using automated oscillometric measurements and 24-h ambulatory monitoring. Additional assessment of adherence to supplement (apart from 24-h urine measures) will be made on the basis of returned pills/bottles. Patients satisfaction will be assessed using a simple 3 question survey (see supplementary material). Furthermore, all collected samples will be sent over to the laboratory for analyses.

However, potassium supplementation at the dose proposed would very likely result in achieved potassium intake of > 90 mmol/ day in all participants. A sample size of 100 participants will allow us to able to estimate both success rates to within a margin of error of at most 5%.

This might bridge the efficacy to effectiveness implementation gap.

Thus, the results of this trial have the potential for a very large scale impact at a public health, as well at an individual level.
