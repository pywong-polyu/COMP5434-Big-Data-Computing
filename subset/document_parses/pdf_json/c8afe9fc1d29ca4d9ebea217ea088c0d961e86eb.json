For example, in a recent publication characterizing SARS-CoV-2 immunity over time, the authors fit pooled longitudinal data, using fitted slopes to infer the duration of SARS-CoV-2 immunity. In fact, such approaches can lead to misleading conclusions as a result of statistical model-fitting artifacts. To exemplify this phenomenon, we reanalyzed one of the markers (pseudovirus neutralizing titer) in the publication, using mixed-effects modeling, a methodology better suited to longitudinal datasets like these. Our findings showed that the half-life was both longer and more variable than reported by the authors. The example selected by us here illustrates the utility of mixed-effects modeling in provide more accurate estimates of the duration and heterogeneity of half-lives of molecular and cellular biomarkers of SARS-CoV-2 immunity.",

This finding was made by observing the energetics and rate of alpha-particle decay [1] , and mathematically modeling this data, which was gathered over an observation period that was (not surprisingly) far shorter than the published half-life.",

However, the decay kinetics of humoral and cellular immunity are Figure 1 .

MEM estimates a median halflife of 100 days (95% population interval: 33-320d), compared with reported means of 27 days using na\u00efvepooled estimation (95% confidence interval (CI): 11-157d) and 90 days using longitudinal analysis (95% CI: 70-125d), as shown in Figures 1E and F in [10] . Thus, the kinetics of PSV response is different than reported, as MEM reveals both a longer median half-life and a greater degree of heterogeneity. The latter difference is to be expected, as the 95% CI in the authors' estimates reflects the uncertainty in the estimation of the mean halflife, whereas the 95% population interval for MEM reflects the heterogeneity present within the patient population (Fig. 1) . We used the resulting fit from the MEM to estimate time taken for PSV to return to baseline (defined here as the same limit of sensitivity, or LOS = 20, used in [10] ), finding that the median duration of return to LOS for pseudovirus neutralizing titer (PSV) was 332 days, with 95% of the population returning to LOS between 39 and 1237 days, and 56% of the population predicted to return to LOS at 1 year (Fig. 2) .

Although some individuals can expect durable coverage against SARS-CoV-2 reinfection by this marker, PSV for approximately half of those infected by the virus will return to LOS by 12 months. MEM thus allows for a more precise estimate of the durability of the immune response and also highlights the inter-individual variability, partitioning it away from experimental noise. We note that MEM relies on the assumption that the individual parameters follow a prespecified statistical distribution (in this case, lognormal for both parameters).",
