It is a source of health statistics that can be used to measure health care services' quality, unraveling important information on disease processes, particularly in emerging and unknown diseases. It can also be a vital tool for medical education and biomedical research. However, autopsy rates have been declining globally. There is an urgent need to develop and validate alternative methods in different settings to provide reliable information on cause of death. In this study, we aimed to determine cause of death (KazCoDe) in neonates and infants using minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS), and to compare these results with those of CDA. We conducted MITS and CDA sequentially on 24 deceased children at the Pathological Bureau of the Akimat of the city of Nur-Sultan. Clinical data of the study subjects were extracted from their clinical records. During both procedures, brain, liver and lung tissues were collected for pathological diagnosis. Fifteen (62.5%) and nine (37.5%) were stillbirths and neonates, respectively. Eight (33.3%) were females and 16 (66.7%) were males. MITS diagnosis of cause of death was concordant with CDA diagnosis in 83.3% out of the 24 cases when considering the immediate and underlying causes of death and reviewing all the clinical and laboratory test results as part of the diagnostic evaluation to arrive at a cause of death (ICD-PM). We concluded that MITS is a valuable and reliable method for cause of death diagnosis in stillbirths and neonates, which can contribute vital mortality statistics in children in the absence of CDA.",

The data generated can also be used for the advancement of science and medical education. Complete diagnostic autopsy (CDA) has been proven irrefutably as the gold standard for the determination of cause of death in many cases over the years [1] . The importance of CDA has been demonstrated clearly over the last two decades in unraveling the pathogenesis of unknown and emerging diseases caused by coronaviruses. For example, Sessa et al. and Salerno et al. [2, 3] recently conducted two detailed reviews. They included all case reports, case series, retrospective and prospective studies, letters to the editors, and reviews that focused on MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2, and autopsy; CDA provided a substantial amount of information on the pathology of these pathogens that could have been missed without autopsy. In their conclusion, they recommended that we still need autopsies in the 21st century and the dictum \"to learn from the dead\" should not be an exception but the rule, particularly regarding unknown and emerging diseases. Despite these benefits, autopsy rates have been declining over the years globally. This decline is of great concern to public health, as mortality data in communities of the majority of the world's population remain largely unrecorded. Worst still is the fact that low-and middle-income countries (LMIC), which bear most of the global burden of disease, suffer more from the lack of these vital statistics [4] [5] [6] .",

In Kazakhstan, the observed decline in autopsy rates is no exception, particularly as regards death occurring in adults (unpublished report). The determination of cause of death has largely been based on clinical information. We are of the opinion that the time for validating alternative methods of obtaining tissues for cause of death diagnosis has come. The diagnostic accuracy of the minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) procedure has been tested against CDA in some few previous studies in adults, children, stillbirths and neonates [9] [10] [11] . The great potential for MITS to add reliable cause of death information was also confirmed in one recently published study in a population in Malawi [12] . To date, no large-scale, multicenter studies have been conducted to validate the diagnostic accuracy of MITS when compared to CDA. Nowadays, with the challenge of COVID-19 as a highly transmissible disease and other emerging infectious diseases, complete diagnostic autopsy in these patients may not be feasible due to the potential high risk of infection, and the only way to determine a cause of death remains MITS [13] .",

In assigning the cause of death, the MITS team independently evaluated all the results of histology, microbiology and cytogenetic tests on the samples collected during MITS.

The histopathological features in the brain and liver tissues were mainly non-specific and did not contribute significantly to the pathological diagnosis of the cause of death. The lung tissues, however, showed significant features that contributed to both the immediate and underlying cause of death. Bronchopulmonary dysplasia, pneumonic features and alveolar hyaline membranes were a common finding in the lungs of these still births and neonates.

In all cases, the autopsy provided much information about each unknown coronavirus. Authors concluded that, despite advanced technologies in all diagnostic fields, autopsy remains the gold standard method to under-stand the biological features and the pathogenesis of unknown infections, especially when awareness of a pathogen is restricted and the impact on the healthcare system is substantial. This clearly indicates that without autopsy studies, no significant information about the pathogenesis of these pathogens could have been known. Minimally invasive tissue sampling (MITS) is increasingly used in postmortem examinations for ascertaining the CoD in stillbirths and neonates [15] . Even though CDA is the gold standard in identifying the cause of death, one recently published multicenter study in Ethiopia confirmed that MITS could be a useful alternative method in the pathological evaluation and the determination of cause of death in preterm neonates [16] . Moreover, the MITS method (performed in Mozambique, South Africa, Kenya, Mali, and Bangladesh) was able to determine causes of death in stillborn fetuses and in deceased neonates and children younger than 5 years [17] . MITS also has the potential to address the knowledge gap on specific causes of neonatal mortality in situations where complete diagnostic autopsy is not routinely conducted in clinical practice. Additionally, owing to the MITS method, hospital-acquired multidrugresistant bacterial infections were found to be the leading immediate cause of neonatal deaths in an observational study in India [18] . This is the first study in Kazakhstan that has been conducted to evaluate the validity of MITS in stillborn babies and neonates and compared the results with that of CDA. Although our cohort is small, our results show that there is a high concordance in cause of death diagnosis between these two pathologic approaches. There is a strong potential that when appropriately trained health officials in the technique conduct MITS, with adequate sampling of target organs for pathological, microbiological and molecular analysis, a cause of death diagnosis can be confidently determined in stillbirths and neonatal deaths. The mortality data obtained using MITS procedure seem adequate to guide the development and implementation of effective intervention strategies and improve current protocols for preventing intrauterine and neonatal death. MITS requires less time to perform, is less costly and more esthetically acceptable to pathologists and relatives of deceased children. In our study, we found that intrauterine hypoxia, congenital malformations and infectious diseases were the main causes of death in these premature babies and neonates. Overall, intrauterine hypoxia constituted 54.2%, with 100% diagnostic concordance between the two methods. Congenital malformations, deformities and chromosomal abnormalities were the second cause of death in our patients' cohort, representing 20.8% of all the cases. In a previous study in stillbirths and neonates in Mozambique, intrauterine hypoxia ranked third in cause of death diagnosis, preceded only by fetal growth restrictions and infectious diseases [8] . A South African study found that congenital malformations were the leading cause of death (22.1%) in children 1-59 months of age [19] .",

Mortality statistics are very crucial for global health development and for planning, prioritization and implementation of prevention strategies. MITS is accurate in the majority of cases (83.3%), less time consuming, requires less skills that would be required for CDA, and less expensive, thus saving funds that can be invested in other health care programs.

Further analysis and more time for face-to-face gathering of information were hampered by the COVID-19 quarantine measures, suspension of or very limited access granted for research activities and the repurposing of the laboratory services for COVID-19 diagnoses. For this reason, we could not perform some molecular tests such as the PCR. Nevertheless, we successfully demonstrated the utility of MITS and its diagnostic performance when compared to CDA in pathological practice. ",
