Objectives: To determine the prevalence of 9 infectious agents in gastrointestinal (GI)-diseased and healthy foals with ages ranging from 1 to 20 weeks of age and to what degree coinfections are associated with clinical signs of GI disease. Study design: Retrospective controlled observational study. Methods: The population consisted of 88 Thoroughbred foals aged 2 days to 17 weeks born on 32 different studfarms in Kentucky. Healthy (n = 37) and GI-diseased (n = 51) foals were identified based on clinical presentation. Faecal samples were analysed for 9 infectious agents by real-time PCR: equine rotavirus, equine coronavirus, Clostridium difficile toxins A & B, Neorickettsia risticii, Clostridium perfringens alpha toxin, Lawsonia intracellularis, Rhodococcus equi, Cryptosporidium spp., and Salmonella spp. Salmonella was also cultured from overnight selenite enrichment broth. Results: The prevalence of infectious pathogens under study was between 0% (Lawsonia intracellularis) and 34.6% (equine rotavirus). The overall prevalence for any infectious agent was 63.2% in the GI-diseased group and 43.2% in the healthy group. Coinfections were significantly more frequent in the sick group (15 monoinfections vs. 22 coinfections) than in the healthy group (12 vs. 4, respectively, P = 0.0002). Six of the 8 infectious agents were associated with the GI-diseased group, the other 2 were not (equine coronavirus and R. equi). Conclusions: The use of panels rather than individual tests in combination with quantitative toxin gene analysis enables detection of coinfections significantly associated with risk of disease.

In equine veterinary medicine, coinfections and the consequent interactions contributing to intensify GI disease have not been as well documented. Epidemiological data on infectious agents causing equine diarrhoea is incomplete and fractionated. This study provides a prevalence overview of 9 infectious agents in foals in central Kentucky. The 9 infectious agents belong to 3 groups of infectious agents including viruses, bacteria and protozoa. Among the viruses, group A rotaviruses (GARVs) are thought to be the main cause of diarrhoea in foals up to 3 months of age. Equine GARVs have been identified in the faeces of foals with GI disease in the UK [14] , the United States of America [15, 16] , Australia [17] , New Zealand [18] , Ireland [19] and Japan [20] . Serological data from several countries, indicate that equine GARVs are ubiquitous. Our ERV prevalence in Central Kentucky of 36% was comparable with a recent report of 20% prevalence in foals in Florida [18] . Concurrent infections of rotavirus and Salmonella was described by Eugster et al. [21] . This coinfection was also found in the current study (n = 1) but other coinfections were significantly more frequent: rotavirus was mostly associated with equine coronavirus (n = 7) and Cryptosporidium spp. (n = 6), which are unique combinations not previously reported in the equine literature. In young children with acute watery diarrhoea, coinfections of rotavirus with other viruses (noro-, adeno and/or astrovirus) were present in 39% of the studied cases [22] . Additionally, pre-existing rotavirus infections increase the risk of bacteraemia in children with nontyphoid Salmonella gastroenteritis clearly indicating the type of detrimental interaction coinfecting agents may exert on the host [23] . Cryptosporidium coinfections have not been reported in horses but have been described in other animal species or man [24, 25] .

Although this study and those of others have identified coronaviruses in foals with enteric disease, the pathogenicity and its aetiological role in enteric disease have not been examined. The current prevalence study clearly shows that healthy foals without signs of GI disease are equally often infected with equine coronavirus as foals with GI disease and suggests low pathogenicity of ECoV in foals. However, when analysed as coinfecting agent, ECoV was significantly associated with diseased animals: all ECoV infections in the GI-diseased group were associated with coinfections (15 of 15) while foals in the healthy group were mostly monoinfected (8 of 10). This could indicate that pre-existing coronavirus infections facilitate opportunistic secondary infections through neutropenia and lymphopenia of the local immune environment as is known in other species [28] [29] [30] Secondary bacterial and parasitic infections from Gram-negative and anaerobic microflora are described in other species and cause additional complications related to intestinal damage, bacteraemia, toxinaemia and altered mucosal functions [14, 30] . Opportunistic infections can be of different origin, including bacterial or protozoal, as shown in this study. Coinfection studies in piglets indicate that coronavirus and bacterial coinfections have a significant effect on the magnitude of the inflammatory immune response and tissue damage compared with monoinfections [29] . In young turkeys, coronavirus and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) interact synergistically with severe growth depression and high mortality when compared with monoinfected turkeys [30] . Turkeys infected first with coronavirus and then with EPEC developed greater mortality and increased frequency of attaching and effacing lesions than that observed in turkeys inoculated with EPEC prior to turkey coronavirus or simultaneously inoculated with these agents; these observations, although in different species, could suggest an under-recognised role for coronavirus infections in foals.
