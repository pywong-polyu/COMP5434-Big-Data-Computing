According to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, by the end of July 2021, 193,657,725 confirmed cases and more than 4 million deaths were reported due to COVID-19 which is highly contagious and pathogenic [1] . Healthcare workers (HCWs) are the primary point of care for the community, especially in the fight against communicable disease outbreaks. They are at risk of being affected by infectious diseases and occupational exposure while both controlling the spread of disease and providing infected patients with the medical care they need [2] . According to the International Council of Nurses, as of December 31, 2020, more than 1.6 million HCWs in 34 countries have been infected with COVID-19, with the total number of nurse deaths from COVID-19 in 59 countries being 2710 [3] . Bandyopadhyay et al. [4] pointed out that infections and deaths from COVID-19 among the HCWS in different countries worldwide in the early stages of the pandemic were at a critical level. Similar to the other countries, HCWs in Turkey were exposed to risks occurring due to COVID-19 during the pandemic. More than 40,000 HCWs have been reported to be infected with COVID-19, according to unofficial statements of the Ministry of Health, and one in every 10 people infected with the disease is an HCW [5] .",

Therefore, the use of PPE is the focus of employee safety for HCWs, which are at the frontline during the pandemic. However, another aspect brought out by the use of PPE during the COVID-19 pandemic is the skin-related injuries and dermatological problems caused by the use of one or more PPE during long and uninterrupted working hours [8] [9] [10] . The necessity of using PPE to ensure infection control in this process has shown that this non-medical equipment that comes into contact with skin and tissues can also cause skin injuries and should be considered within the scope of medical device-related pressure injuries [11] [12] [13] .",

Moreover, the fact that HCWs with different face sizes and shapes have to use the equipment, especially masks and safety glasses, that are manufactured in standard sizes, for a long time also leads to these injuries [12, 16] .

Because it has been reported that problems that may arise due to the ergonomics, comfort and physical properties of PPE provided by institutions can increase the risk of infection transmission to HCWs by damaging the skin integrity [19, 20] . Furthermore, it is known that the problems caused due to the use of PPE negatively affect the attitudes and behaviors of HCWs to use this equipment effectively [21, 22] . Therefore, given these risks, it is important to address and be aware of the problems associated with PPE use in terms of both employee and patient safety in the delivery of healthcare services, demonstrating the need for more ergonomic and skin-friendly PPEs with a higher protective effect. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the skin-related problems caused by the PPE use in HCWs during the Covid-19 pandemic and to identify the factors contributing to their occurrence.",

For the content validity of the questionnaire used in this study, three nurse academicians experts in pressure injuries, one doctor specialized in dermatology, and four HCWs who use PPEs in the clinic were asked to evaluate the suitability, reliability and understandability of the items. As per the Davis technique [25] for content validity, the experts assessed and graded each question in the questionnaire as \"Relevant (4)\", \"Need minor revision (3)\", \"Need major revision (2)\", ''Not relevant (1).\" As per the experts' suggestions, no item was removed from the questionnaire while items that were graded as 2-3 have been revised with the most appropriate statements. The Content Validity Index, based on the experts' opinions, of the questionnaire used as a data collection tool in this study, was found to be 0.93. Furthermore, Kendall's W value related to the scores obtained from eight experts was determined as W = 0.940, p = 0.020. The final questionnaire consists of 3 parts. The first part includes questions aimed at obtaining data on the demographic characteristics of HCWs (9 questions), while the second part on PPE usage characteristics and exposure to skin-related problems due to PPE use (10 questions). In the last part, (6 questions) HCWs were asked to state skin-related problems they were exposed to, according to the type of equipment they used. In this part, they were also requested to mention the anatomical parts where stated skin-related problems develop according to the type of equipment. The data were obtained by sharing the online link of the questionnaire, created using the Google forms, in the WhatsApp groups of HCWs.",

            "text": "Our findings indicated that the skin-related problems reported by HCWs were mostly associated with PPE such as gloves, surgical/N95 masks. Montero-Vilchez et al. [8] reported that frequent handwashing, glove, and mask use are the most important factors associated with adverse skin reactions [8] . The results of different studies have also proven the presence of skin-related problems occurring due to the use of gloves, surgical/N95masks, which are reported to be used more frequently [15, 17, 19, 21, 24, [26] [27] [28] [29] . Although they differ by the type of equipment used, the most common adverse effects of PPE on the skin have been reported to be contact dermatitis, dryness, acne and eczema, pressure-related symptoms and itching [8] . Dryness, itching, perspiration and moisture were the most common problems among the glove-related skin problems reported by the participants in this study. Kiely et al. [30] emphasized the prevalence of skin symptoms associated with dryness on hands due to glove use [30] . Long-term use of gloves made of waterproof materials with poor air permeability, such as rubber and plastic, prevents the evaporation of sweat on the skin of the hands, leading up to the development of skin-related problems [9] . Darlenski et al. [31] reported that moisture-related skin injuries in the hands are associated with glove use, which causes hyperhydration of the stratum corneum layer of the skin [31] . Furthermore, hand washing, the use of disinfectants and the irritating features of gloves, whose importance and necessity become more prominent during the pandemic, are known to contribute to the development of skin problems such as dryness of the hands, itching, dermatitis and eczema [9, 30] . Various studies have also supported the presence of problems such as dryness, itching, dermatitis, skin soaked with sweat associated with the use of gloves and hand hygiene [15, 24, 26, 28, 32] . The use of masks has been a basic protective barrier during the pandemic for the HCWs, at high risk of contact with COVID-19 patients. However, the pressure and shear force occurred in the contact areas due to the use of the masks for long hours and the tight fit on the face, and decreased tissue tolerance due to increased moisture in the areas under the mask is responsible for the development of adverse skin injuries and problems associated with the use of masks [11, 12, 17] . Besides, it is known that preservatives and allergens in the materials from which surgical masks and especially N95 masks are produced increase the risk of contact dermatitis, the barrier dysfunction of the skin and damage to the skin microbiota, which facilitates the formation of skin lesions [33] . The majority of studies in the literature have confirmed that respirators such as N95 are the most harmful type of mask to the skin, with prolonged use time [8, 9, 17, 34] . Peko et al. [35] showed that the surgical mask is potentially less irritating to the facial skin than the KN95 mask, as it applies less pressure and facilitates the faster return of increased temperature in the facial area to its basal levels [35] . However, in a different study, it was emphasized that deformations in the structure of surgical masks, examined with an electron microscope after short but continuous use, may damage the moisture and temperature balance of the skin, increasing the susceptibility to the development of inflammatory skin diseases [36] . Chaiyabutr et al. [37] reported that when compared to cloth masks, the surgical mask is more associated with the development of skin lesions such as acne and itching, especially in individuals with oily skin [37] . Our study findings, similar to the literature, showed that skin-related problems reported due to the use of surgical/N95 mask may be mostly related to these etiological factors, although there was no investigation performed on the type of mask used.",

It is important to investigate areas where the negative effects of PPE use on the skin develop, to identify areas where protection and precautions need to be taken for safer use of this equipment. In this study, the negative effects of the use of surgical/N95 mask were found to be mostly on areas such as the nasal bridge and behind the ear and around, while the negative effects of the use of safety glasses/face shields were mainly on the forehead, nasal bridge and around the eyes. In similar studies, the nasal bridge, forehead, cheeks and hands have been reported to be the anatomical areas most affected by the long-term use of PPEs [8, 9, 11, 12, 24, 26] . Meanwhile, these areas may vary depending on the type of equipment used. Kiely et al. [30] reported the hands as the most frequently affected area in PPE use, associated with the use of gloves [30] . The skin behind the ears is known to be susceptible to pressure injuries due to repetitive friction caused by the ear loops of face masks [9] . Long-term use of the N95 mask is a predisposing factor for the development of pressure injury on the nasal bridge and the dorsum of the nose [17, 26] . Furthermore, it is a known fact that the hard texture of the materials used in the production of protective gowns/overalls type equipment worn as a part of isolation measures are likely to cause friction and irritation on the skin, and also excessive sweating and moisture they cause can lead to damage to the barrier function of the skin [24] . This has been supported by the fact that perspiration and moisture were the most reported problems by the HCWs in this study related to the use of protective gowns/overalls.",

            "text": "Several studies have focused on risk factors that are effective in the occurrence of skin-related problems associated with PPE use. In these studies, different from our findings, variables such as gender, working time, previous history of dermatitis or allergic diseases and status of working in pandemic clinics were also found to be risk factors for adverse skin problems [15, 19, 37] . In this study, working time with PPE over >4 h is determined to be a significant variable affecting the presence of skin-related problems. Xia et al. [38] showed that the use of >8 h PPE was associated with skin damage due to the use of gloves, and the risk of pressure injury may increase with the use of >4 h PPE [38] . Lam et al. [17] reported that the use of N95 respirators ranging from 3 to 7 h is a risk factor for adverse skin outcomes [17] . Marraha et al. [26] found that wearing protective gowns more than 3 times in a shift, wearing safety glasses >2 h, and working with masks/N95 respirators for 4-7 days significantly increased the presence of skin injuries [26] . Lin et al. [15] and Etgu and Ozdemir [19] found that working with PPE >6 h per day was associated with adverse skin reactions. Although there are different findings in the literature, studies emphasize that increased working time with PPEs is a major risk factor for the presence of skin-related injury and problems [8, 27, 38] . Therefore, the continuous working durations of HCWs with PPEs is a problem that needs to be addressed and managed in terms of employee safety.",

In the literature, concerns about the quality, protection ability and comfort of PPE have been pointed out to be the effective factors in their use [39] . Our study findings showed that applying methods such as using multiple PPE on top of each other to increase the sense of protection is a factor that can be effective in the presence of PPE-related skin problems. These methods applied by HCWs are important since they increase the exposure to etiological factors in the development of skin problems associated with the use of PPE. For example, although it is recommended to use double gloves to reduce the risk of viral contamination during the removal stage of PPE [40] , in some studies, an increase in the frequency of handwashing and disinfectant use, along with the use of gloves worn in more than one, have been shown possibly to contribute to the development of skin problems [19] . These findings, in addition to supplying PPEs for HCWs in the right quantity, timely and of sufficient quality, also highlight the need for training that focuses on the risks and benefits of PPE use and correct recommendations for PPE use.",

In the recommendations made by National Pressure Injury Advisory Panel (NPIAP), it has been reported that HCWs should relieve the areas at least 5 min every 2 h to protect the skin from the pressure caused by the N95 respirator in the contact areas, and thin prophylactic dressings in the form of strips can be used for the nasal bridge, cheekbones and behind the ears that are in contact with masks or loops. Furthermore, cleaning and drying the face with pH-balanced cleansers before putting on the face masks, protecting the skin moisture, and applying liquid protectors to the areas that the mask comes into direct contact with are recommended in order to prevent PPE-related skin injury [41] . It has also been reported that the use of moisturizing hand cream may prevent the development of side effects on the skin related to hand washing and the use of gloves [8, 15, 26] . Our study findings indicated that half of the HCWs applied similar preventive measures as recommended in the literature. Moreover, in this sample, among participants who used preventive measures, the number of participants who reported not being exposed to a skin-related problem was significantly higher. Benefits of the use of prophylactic dressings and methods that redistribute or reduce pressure in areas where pressure is intensified and repetitive friction are present due to long-term use of PPEs and moistening the hands in the right way and appropriate amount have been also supported by various studies [12, 42, 43] .",

Our results revealed the presence of skin problems in the vast majority of participating HCWs associated with the use of at least one PPE. Furthermore, the presence of skin-related problems developing due to the use of PPE was mostly associated with the use of surgical/N95 mask respirators and gloves. Moreover, skin-related problems were more likely to occur in HCWs who used PPE in a shift >4 h, those taking additional measures to increase the sense of protection, and those not applying preventive measures while using PPE. Given the results of this and similar studies in the literature, it seems that more efforts are needed to reduce the prevalence of skinrelated problems that can happen due to PPE use. Therefore, we recommend, in health institutions, the plans to be made focusing on employee health, ergonomics and comfort, plans to be made for shorter shifts with PPEs since it is a major risk factor, to organise training emphasizing the correct use of PPEs and skin-related preventive measures, and to provide PPEs that are user and skin-friendly, with high quality to users.",
