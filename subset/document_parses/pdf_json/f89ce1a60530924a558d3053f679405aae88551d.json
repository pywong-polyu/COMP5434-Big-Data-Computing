            "text": "Hands-on cybersecurity training allows students and professionals to practice various tools and improve their technical skills. The training occurs in an interactive learning environment that enables completing sophisticated tasks in full-fledged operating systems, networks, and applications. During the training, the learning environment allows collecting data about trainees' interactions with the environment, such as their usage of command-line tools. These data contain patterns indicative of trainees' learning processes, and revealing them allows to assess the trainees and provide feedback to help them learn. However, automated analysis of these data is challenging. The training tasks feature complex problem-solving, and many different solution approaches are possible. Moreover, the trainees generate vast amounts of interaction data. This paper explores a dataset from 18 cybersecurity training sessions using data mining and machine learning techniques. We employed pattern mining and clustering to analyze 8834 commands collected from 113 trainees, revealing their typical behavior, mistakes, solution strategies, and difficult training stages. Pattern mining proved suitable in capturing timing information and tool usage frequency. Clustering underlined that many trainees often face the same issues, which can be addressed by targeted scaffolding. Our results show that data mining methods are suitable for analyzing cybersecurity training data. Educational researchers and practitioners can apply these methods in their contexts to assess trainees, support them, and improve the training design. Artifacts associated with this research are publicly available.",

Therefore, the assessment is much more complex than assessing simple tasks such as memorizing facts. 2. Each student is unique. Every student has different previous knowledge, experience, motivation, and approach to learning. As a result, students adopt different strategies to solve the tasks. This is natural, but it further complicates the conditions for automatically assessing hands-on tasks. 3. Students generate a lot of data. During the training, even a class that is relatively small (10-20 students) and time-constrained (1-2 hours) can generate hundreds of data records. As a result, manually processing these data becomes quickly infeasible. 4. The assessment process is not straightforward. It is unclear how to transform the raw data from training into educational insights useful for assessment. As the Fig. 1 The first student ran the cracking tool 24 times within an approximately 5-minute time frame, with various combinations of arguments, often repeating the previous (incorrect) combinations. After that, the student stopped for 4 minutes, probably to find help, and executed a correct command Fig. 2 The second student assumed that the tool had the .exe suffix of Windows OS executables, which does not apply to Linux OS. The student was apparently unfamiliar with Linux or the cracking tool but then instantly executed a correct command without any previous incorrect tries. We can assume that they received outside help examples in Figs. 1 and 2 demonstrated, even a relatively constrained assignment can generate various data for assessment.",

These include learner difficulties, correlations between learning behaviors and performance, and teaching strategies that lead to better learning (Romero and Ventura, 2020; Bienkowski et al., 2012) . Garc\u00eda et al. (2010) applied ARM on data capturing students' usage of a learning management system, discovering relationships between students' activities and final grades. Instructors can use this information to adjust the course or identify struggling students early. Kobayashi (2014) also used ARM to uncover the errors that frequently co-occurred at various proficiency levels when learning spoken English. The pattern mining revealed types of mistakes that distinguish lower-level and upper-level students. Malekian et al. (2020) applied SPM on data representing students' actions and task submissions in an online learning environment. The researchers wanted to discover the behavior patterns that lead to successful or unsuccessful assessment outcomes. Therefore, they split the sequences of actions into two categories depending on the outcome of the sequence's final submission. The failed sequences contained mainly repeated assessment submissions and discussion forum views. In contrast, the passed sequences included multiple reviews of lecture materials. This information can be used to modify the learning environment to discourage unproductive behavior. Gao et al. (2021) mined sequential patterns from programming logs to identify struggling students. Timely recognizing these students is essential for promoting their learning. To establish ground truth, the researchers again split the logs of highand low-performing students. Then, they mined patterns that either dominated in one group to discover its specifics, or occurred in both groups to reveal similarities. After that, they used the patterns as features in a classifier algorithm to predict student performance. Vellido et al. (2010) motivate the usage of clustering in educational contexts. In addition, they also provide a brief overview of literature where clustering was applied to solve educational problems. Next, Romero and Ventura (2010) and Dutt et al. (2017) performed literature reviews of EDM papers. Clustering has been used to provide feedback to instructors, detect undesirable or unusual student behavior, analyze and model student behavior, and group students by various characteristics, such as their learning approaches. Yin et al. (2015) used the OPTICS algorithm to cluster students' programming assignments, aiming to support autograding based on the type of solution. Student source code was represented as an abstract syntax tree, with the normalized tree edit distance as the similarity measure for clustering. The researchers discovered clusters corresponding to distinct types of solutions (canonical, correct but longer code, complex solution, and so on).",

Instructors can revisit the explanation of this tool and stress how its argument combinations affect the scan duration. \u2022 Targeted instruction -when a student exhibits patterns associated with errors or unproductive behavior, the instructor can intervene appropriately. This intervention can include providing tailored hints, feedback, scaffolding, or suitably correcting the student. Identifying struggling students early and helping them is crucial for supporting their learning. For example, we discovered a cluster of trainees who adopted a trial-and-error approach when using Metasploit. If this happened during class, instructors could visit these students in real-time and provide suitable assistance. By identifying specific students belonging to the cluster, the instructor can save time by providing the same help to all students in that cluster. \u2022 Marking/grading -knowing the common mistakes aids with both manual and automated grading. Instructors can create a grading rubric based on the observed errors and approaches. Moreover, an autograder can be set up to grade specific actions as passed or failed.",

This includes fixing unclear or problematic tasks. For example, we discovered that in Training B, participants excessively used the cd and ls tools to traverse the filesystem. The assignment can specify more clearly what type of file to look for and where. It can also feature hints. \u2022 Machine learning -the patterns and their features (such as using a particular command or making a specific mistake) can act as input in other machine learning models for further analysis and student modeling. For example, the discovered patterns could be used to train a classifier to predict student success or failure. \u2022 Curricular support -several policies and curricular guidelines in cybersecurity (CC2020 Task Force, 2020; Joint Task Force on Cybersecurity Education, 2017; Parrish et al., 2018) prescribe what skills should be taught and assessed. However, the information about how to perform this assessment is left to the educators. Our paper demonstrates a possible solution for assessing hands-on exercises in cybersecurity, which other educators can adopt or adapt.",
