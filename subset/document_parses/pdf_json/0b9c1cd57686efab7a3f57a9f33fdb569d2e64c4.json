Generalized seizures are the most common type in the patients. Opportunistic infections are a stereotypical predisposing factor for seizures in HIV patients, but a variety of pathogenic factors can also be found in these patients, such as metabolic perturbation and drug-drug interactions. The diagnostic criteria for seizures in these patients are the same as those in the general population. As HIV patients with seizures need to take both antivirals and antiepileptic drugs, the risk of drug-drug interactions is greatly increased, and the side effects of drugs may also become more prominent. At present, most experience in antiepileptic drug usage has come from the general population, and there is still a lack of guidance of antiepileptic drug use in special groups such as the HIV-infected people. Unlike the old-generation drugs that involve metabolisms through CYP450, the first-line antiepileptic drugs usually bypass CYP450, thus having less drug-drug interactions. In this review, we summarize the recent research progress on the above-mentioned widely discussed topics and make a prospect on future research direction.",

Seizures or epilepsy is a serious type of complication. Patients with witnessed seizures need long-term periodic medication control, making it a challenge for clinical drug management. In pediatric patients living with HIV, seizures or epilepsy may be concurrent with brain development delay or neuron-cognitive impairment [4] . Besides, HIV-seropositive patients with documented seizures are at a higher risk of developing other CNS syndromes, compared with the HIV-negative patients [5] . Among these patients, opportunistic infection (OI) as a result of deep immunosuppression is the most frequent cause; however, there is a considerable proportion of patients with no predominant causes, suffered from HIV encephalopathy (HIVE). Another part of patients has seizure relapses due to the interactions between antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) and antiretroviral drugs (ARVs), which makes seizure improperly controlled.",

As demonstrated in previous research, the incidence and prevalence of seizures in the general population range 0.4-1.0% [10] and 0.05% [11] , respectively, while those in the HIV+ patients (including the patients with documented seizures prior to HIV infection and patients with newly-onset seizures [NOS] after the infection of HIV) are 1.8-19.8% and 2-19.8%, respectively [7, 8] . These two statistical indicators varies among different countries/regions or longitudinally in time. Studies from centers in Africa peculiarly tended to report a higher prevalence or incidence, while the developed countries usually reported lower incidence. A retrospective study from Ireland showed that the incidence of seizures is estimated to be doubled in the HIV+ population than in the local general population (with the incidence of seizures is 2.4%) [7] . However, after a 5-year retrospective study, Kim et al. from Korea found the incidence of seizures in HIV+ patients was 3.0%, compared with 0.24% in the general population [12] . Samia et al. from South Africa reported both prevalence and incidence of seizures in the included HIVinfected children as 7.6% [13] . Another study from South Africa reported a 23% rate of history of seizure in 227 involved HIV+ children [14] . This situation may be due to the pandemic of AIDS in Africa, where many children were afflicted through the maternal-neonatal transmission. What's worth noticing is that reports from India also revealed a relatively higher distribution of seizures in HIV+ patients. Sinha et al. reported an overall 20% proportion of NOS in a local hospital [15] .",

Under most circumstances, patients are at the advanced stage of infection, when the OI becomes a common event, from which seizures arise. And it seems that the more advanced stage of HIV infection, the greater the likelihood of seizures to occur. Indeed, many patients inflicted seizures after the diagnosis of AIDS [16] . Satishchandra et al. discovered that seizures were the presenting manifestation in one of five cases in their series [21] . Intriguingly, the majority of seizures in HIV+ patients in their study were still present at the stage of advanced infection. From the statistical data, seizures are unlikely to be conceived of as an exceptional complication of advanced HIV infection, but they have an adverse impact on the quality of life.",

The drug-drug interactions are also responsible for the recurrence of seizures, and they will be discussed in detail in the following therapeutic sections. Even dating back to 30 years ago, the OIs were also reported as the most dominating cause of seizures in HIVinfected patients [17] . HIV+ patients are more susceptible to pathogenic microbes such as toxoplasmosis, cryptococcus species, tuberculosis, and John Cunningham virus (JCV), four most common pathogens for OI, due to the immunosuppression. Typically, it is when the CD4 count is lower than 100 cells/\u03bcL that these pathogens cause encephalitis [25] . Nevertheless, tuberculosis is an exception that can cause tuberculous meningitis (TBM) at any level of CD4 count as long as there is immune suppression [26] . Following the widely-adopted highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART), both the incidence and mortality of these OIs have declined. According to a most updated meta-analysis, OIs account for nearly 50% of the causative factors in approximately 68% of HIV+ patients experiencing NOS with conclusive causes, with toxoplasmosis diagnosed in the majority (21%), followed by progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) and cryptococcal meningitis (14% for each) [9] . This paper focuses on several regular infectious pathogens and non-infectious agents.",

Domestic cats are the only known definitive hosts of T. gondii and often lead to the indirect infection of the parasite in humans through food contamination with spore-forming oocysts. T. gondii is one of the most common infectious agents responsible for newly-onset seizures in HIV seropositive patients [18, 27, 28] . They are often afflicted with focal seizures caused by mass lesions. CT or MRI scan often shows single or multiple nodular lesions. However, even if no hypointense lesions could be seen, some silent lesions still revealed themselves at autopsy. CSF biochemical examination is a more reliable choice for diagnosis than serologic assays, and a study reported a sensitivity of 75% with the use of B1 gene nested PCR [29] . However, the lumbar puncture cannot be administered to patients with increased intracranial pressure due to the high risk of cerebral hernia; in this circumstance, how to diagnose and when to decide to start treatment usually rely on empirical experience. The routine protocol for HIV+ patients is a long-term consecutive inhibition therapy until continuous antiretroviral therapy raises the CD4 count over 200 cells/\u03bcL. And a standard therapeutic plan is the co-administration of pyrimethamine, sulfadiazine, and folinic acid. Besides, a prospective study from Cameroon concluded that newly-onset seizures in these patients have a benign clinical course and favorable prognosis, thus not requiring AEDs [30] .",

It is the second most common HIV-associated OI among adults in the sub-Saharan Africa [31] , and the global prevalence of cryptococcal infection has been estimated to be 6% in HIV+ patients [32] . According to a prospective study, in 28% of the HIV-infected cryptococcal meningitis participants, the generalized seizures were regularly witnessed [19] . CSF analysis is a piece of important evidence for diagnosis. The opening pressure often appears to be greater than 25 cmH 2 O [33] . CSF cultures are definitive standards, but it may take weeks to reveal a positive result. The India Ink assay can assist diagnosis, but a negative result cannot deny the possibilities of positive results. Results of imageology may be nonspecific due to the nonmeningitic neurologic complications of HIV, such as atrophy in HIVE patients. The prognosis of such patients is correlated with the CSF opening pressure. Patients with seizures tended to have higher opening pressure, which has an inverse relationship with the occurrences of seizure attacks. For the treatment of HIV+ patients, an adequate treatment course at the beginning is recommended. The administration of amphotericin B should not be interrupted until the CSF culture turns negative. And a consistent maintenance therapy using fluconazole should follow the initial therapy as far as CD4 count is over 100 cells/\u03bcL [34] . In patients with NOS, cautions should be given to AED applications due to the potential drug-drug interactions and the latent impairment in renal clearance [19] . Therefore, it is more practicable to screen asymptomatic cryptococci infection among HIV-seropositive patients, thus facilitating prompt prevention and treatment.",

A considerable amount of studies have described PML as a crucial cause of seizures in such a population, and the incidence of seizures was found to be 18% [4, 12, 45, 46] . The type of seizures can also be focal or generalized. PCR of CSF is a reliable tool for diagnosis. Neuroimaging often shows single or multiple fusion lesions without mass effect. Nevertheless, patients presenting with seizures are inclined to have demyelinating lesions in the immediate vicinity of the cortex. Usually, treatments have satisfying effects on seizures.",

Assessment of a NOS is important. If it lasts less than 20 min, status epilepticus is beyond consideration, so oral AEDs and treatment of the cause are recommended. Unless there is a risk of developing status epilepticus, treatment for the first unprovoked seizure is not advised [52] . Any seizure that becomes prolonged or recurrent seizures without recovering consciousness between the seizures can be considered to have progressed to status epilepticus. Benzodiazepines (such as lorazepam, diazepam, or midazolam intravenous injection) are still the first-line drugs for initial status epilepticus [53] .",

This results in either an increase in serum levels of AED or ARV, which will increase the risk of potential drug toxicology; or a decrease in serum level, which will lead to virologic failure or seizure recurrence. A study has shown that the combined use of carbamazepine and efavirenz reduces the serum concentration of efavirenz [54] . Another study showed that the half-life of nevirapine in patients treated with phenytoin sodium was significantly reduced [55] . This is because this generation of AED is mainly oxidized and metabolized by the CYP450 enzyme system, but efavirenz is both an inhibitor and an inducer of CYP3A4. Some AEDs are also partially (valproic acid, phenobarbital, or oxcarbazepine) or completely (lamotrigine) eliminated through conjugation. As PIs are becoming well-received among HIV+ patients, these two classes of drugs also interact mutually. It has been reported that when combined, lopinavir/ritonavir and atazanavir/ritonavir both lead to a significant decrease in the bioavailability of lamotrigine [56] . However, efavirenz is unlikely to interfere with AEDs and make seizure easier to recur; AEDs that are mainly dependent on conjugation degradation generally do not affect ARVs and result in virologic failure, at the regular dosage of course [42] .",

In vitro experiments have shown that valproate stimulates HIV replication [62] , but this conclusion has not been confirmed in vivo. On the contrary, a study reported a significant reduction of latent HIV in resting T cells in 3 of 4 patients when valproate was combined with HAAR T [63] . Therefore, valproate is a promising option when first-line AEDs are not available.",

Since OIs account for most NOSs, managing to reduce the viral load and increase CD4 count are also effective ways to decrease the risk of seizure recurrence. A cohort study found that the incidence decreased by about 1% after ART administration [64] . Another strictly controlled retrospective case-control study showed that earlier implementation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) was likely to prevent HIV-infected children from eventually developing epilepsy [65] . A study even suggested that it was safe to apply more than one AEDs in HIV+ patients currently treated by cART, as it was helpful to restore the host's immunity, as long as its cumulative dosage was under an adaptable level [66] .",

As the immune system of children is not well-developed, HIV infection at this stage may deteriorate the immune system and result in seizures. Studies showed that there was no significant difference in the percentage of cognitive impairment between children with early and delayed administration of cART [65, 69] . Instead, children who deferred the treatment are prone to developmental delays and even cognition obstacles due to HIVE or other CNS diseases complicated by HIV [70] . This suggests that the benefits of early implementation of cART may outweigh the more cumulative drug toxicity from longer use. And given the special situation in Africa, some scholars have suggested that ART should be carried out once children have any CNS complications [71, 72] .",

The available findings may have geographic limitations and lack broader geographical representation. For example, the conclusions drawn from neurological medical centers may show a higher prevalence than from the general hospitals, because more refractory patients are referred to the former. Results of local hospitals may underestimate the prevalence as it is difficult to guarantee the representativeness of the sample patients for the whole HIV-infected population. 3) Many of the previous studies focused on the incidence or prevalence of seizures but neglected the development of epilepsy. In the past 20 years, the diagnostic and classification criteria of epilepsy and seizures have changed several times. For some quite early studies, it is hard to determine whether the diagnosis was based on internationally recognized diagnostic standards and whether the diagnosis at that time could be classified into the corresponding revised diagnostic entries nowadays. 4) In some studies reporting epilepsy prevalence and incidence, the diagnostic standards was not clarified.
