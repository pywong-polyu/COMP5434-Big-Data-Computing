            "text": "BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Obesity is a strong risk factor for adverse outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, however, the distribution of fat and the amount of muscle mass are more accurate risk factors than BMI. The objective of this study was to assess body composition measures obtained on opportunistic abdominal CTs as predictors of outcome in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. We hypothesized that elevated visceral and intermuscular adipose tissue would be associated with adverse outcome. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Our retrospective study was IRB-approved and HIPAA-compliant. The study group comprised 124 patients (median age: 68 years, IQR: 56, 77; 59 weeks, 65 months) who were admitted with COVID-19 to a single hospital and who had undergone abdominal CT for clinical purposes. Visceral adipose tissue (VAT), subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), and paraspinal and abdominal muscle cross-sectional areas (CSA) were assessed. Clinical information including prognostic factors, time of admission to the intensive care unit (ICU) and time of death within 28 days were obtained. Multivariate time-to-event competing risk models were fitted to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for a composite outcome of ICU admission/mortality associated with a one standard deviation increase in each body compositional measure. Each model was adjusted for age, sex, race, BMI, and cardiometabolic comorbidities. RESULTS: There were 50 patients who were admitted to the ICU or deceased over a median time of 1 day [IQR 1, 6] from hospital admission. Higher VAT/SAT ratio (HR of 1.30; 95% CI 1.04-1.62, p = 0.022) and higher IMAT CSA (HR of 1.44; 95% CI 1.10-1.89, p = 0.008) were associated with a reduced time to ICU admission or death in adjusted models. CONCLUSION: VAT/SAT and IMAT are predictors of adverse outcome in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, independent of other established prognostic factors. This suggests that body composition measures may serve as novel biomarkers of outcome in patients with COVID-19.",

            "text": "Several studies suggest that obesity is a strong risk factor for adverse outcome in patients hospitalized with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) [1] [2] [3] [4] . Body mass index (BMI) is commonly used to assess obesity, but cardiometabolic risk and mortality vary considerably among patients with the same BMI, which is partially attributable to differences in body composition [5, 6] . The distribution of fat and the amount of muscle mass are more accurate risk factors than BMI for cardiometabolic risk. For example, visceral adipose tissue (VAT) is more strongly associated with fasting glucose and adverse serum lipid profile, and increased odds ratios for hypertension, diabetes, and the metabolic syndrome than subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) [7, 8] , which may be relatively protective [9] . Low skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia are known risk factors for cardiometabolic disease [6, [10] [11] [12] [13] , longer hospital stay, and increased mortality [14] ; and fat between muscle cells, intermuscular adipose tissue (IMAT), has been identified as an independent risk factor of impaired glucose tolerance, impaired lipid profile, chronic inflammation, and lower muscle strength and quality [15] .",

Palaiodimos et al. identified BMI \u226535 kg/m 2 , male sex, and age as independent predictors of mortality in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 [4] . However, BMI is an imperfect measure to characterize disease risk and several studies have shown that low muscle mass (sarcopenia) and high-fat mass, especially VAT, are stronger predictors of disease risk and mortality than BMI [29] . VAT is a significant risk factor for cardiometabolic disease [7, 8] , while SAT may be relatively protective [9] . In addition, low skeletal muscle mass and sarcopenia are established indicators of cardiometabolic risk and mortality [6, [10] [11] [12] [13] . Loss of skeletal muscle is accompanied by shifts in adipose tissue and accumulation of fat in ectopic depots. One of those ectopic fat depots is IMAT, adipose tissue located between muscle groups and separated from SAT by a well-defined fascia. Increased IMAT is associated with higher fasting glucose and insulin resistance, and greater prevalence of T2DM [15, 30] .",

Of note, body composition was assessed using chest CTs at the level of the first lumbar vertebra. This anatomical location encompasses less VAT compared to the validated levels at L4 or L5 [32] . Chandarana et al. found higher VAT in patients with COVID-19 who required hospital admission compared to outpatients, despite similar BMI [16] . Three larger studies examining more than 100 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, showed that visceral adiposity was an independent risk factor for adverse outcome, including the need for ICU admission [19] [20] [21] . Yang et al. also identified fatty infiltration of muscle, assessed using CT attenuation, as an independent risk factor for adverse outcome [21] .

Our finding of an independent association between high VAT/SAT and adverse outcome is consistent with the aforementioned studies. Of note, VAT/SAT was an independent predictor of ICU admission and/or death after controlling for covariates, including BMI, suggesting that characteristics specific to VAT might serve as a mechanism for adverse outcome in COVID-19. A reason for the detrimental effects of VAT on cardiometabolic health is its pro-inflammatory characteristics. Individuals with visceral adiposity have higher concentrations of circulating inflammatory cytokines compared to lean controls [33] [34] [35] . In addition, visceral adiposity can contribute to adverse outcome in COVID-19 by diminishing diaphragmatic excursion and increasing airway resistance, and thereby impairing breathing and mechanical ventilation [36] . This is the first study showing high IMAT as an independent risk factor for adverse outcome in COVID-19. Higher IMAT is associated with dyslipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance and the metabolic syndrome and has been shown to be a predictor of subclinical atherosclerosis, independent of traditional risk factors including other fat depots, such as VAT [37] . Studies have suggested that excess IMAT may be pro-inflammatory and promotes and sustains an inflammatory microenvironment [38, 39] . Increased inflammatory markers have been linked to chronic inflammatory airway disease, and studies in patients with COVID-19 have shown higher levels of IL-6 in patients who died from COVID-19 [40, 41] . Therefore, our observed high VAT/SAT and IMAT content in patients admitted to the ICU or patients who died from COVID-19, may be due to their pro-inflammatory nature.",

The study may also be subject to selection bias, since only patients who underwent abdominal CTs were included. It is possible that the observed relationships between the body composition measures considered and adverse outcomes differ between hospitalized patients who had CT scans and hospitalized patients who did not. Patients who underwent abdominal CT scans appeared to be younger and were more likely to be White/Non-Hispanic and less likely to be Hispanic. Further, given that our initial cohort consisted of subjects who were hospitalized at MGH with COVID, we could not evaluate whether body composition affected the rate at which patients were hospitalized following COVID-19 infection. Another limitation inherent to hospitalized cohorts of COVID-19 patients is that patients presented to the hospital care in different stages of disease progression. As such, our time-to-event analysis is indexed on a reference point that is not necessarily comparable for each patient. We also performed body composition measurements using a single slice at the level of L4 instead of the entire abdomen. However, abdominal fat and paraspinal and abdominal muscle CSA determined by single-slice measurements have been shown to be closely correlated with total body fat and muscle volumes [32, 42] . The use of our in-house algorithm limits generalizability of the study. Strengths of our study include the large number of patients admitted to a single hospital with COVID-19 and detailed measures of body composition by CT. Moreover, our statistical approach considered the time from hospitalization to severe disease while accounting for the competing risk of discharge, and adjusted for a wide variety of covariates; however, due to the limited sample size, we could not adjust for all known prognostic factors (e.g., medications patients were taking prior to admission, laboratory parameters, and other comorbidities).",
