According to an epidemiology study conducted in China, skeletal TB and pleural TB constitute the most common form of EPTB, with prevalence of 41.1% and 26.0% respectively. 11 However, the study did not specify the prevalence of abdominal or peritoneal TB. Recent study by Kang et al in 2020 from China showed that prevalence of peritoneal tuberculosis was approximately 4.79%. 12 Unfortunately, up to this date, there has been no study which describe the prevalence of abdominal tuberculosis or peritoneal tuberculosis in Indonesia, even though Indonesia is one of the highest country with tuberculosis burden. Indeed, research of EPTB is difficult to be conducted due to low disease prevalence of EPTB, heterogeneous symptoms, and difficulty in diagnosis. Diagnosing EPTB poses a unique challenge for clinicians worldwide. There is often lack of specific symptoms and history of tuberculosis contacts. Symptoms also varies depending on the site of EPTB. For example, the symptoms of abdominal tuberculosis consisted of abdominal swelling, abdominal pain, abdominal mass, weight loss, fever, and ascites. [13] [14] [15] Meanwhile, central nervous system tuberculosis usually involves fever, headache, altered mental status, and neurological deficits. 16 We believe this case report demonstrates difficulties in diagnosing abdominal tuberculosis. Another important factor that may complicate diagnosis is that this patient came to a tertiary cancer center. This is the first case report in Indonesia DovePress that described a patient with TB presenting with symptoms suggesting ovarian cancer. Furthermore, this case report also showed that PET-scan may cause false positive from enhanced cellular metabolism, whether the cells are malignant or not. Thus, further examinations such as biopsies are needed to make proper diagnosis.",

The most effective method for diagnosing extrapulmonary TB in this case was tissue biopsy through laparoscopy. This is in accordance with previous literatures which stated that the gold standard for determining the diagnosis of abdominal TB was laparoscopy with biopsy. 13, [18] [19] [20] In addition, it should be noted that infection and inflammation can also cause positive PET scan. 21 In EPTB, it is challenging to obtain material from infected tissue and often, there is a small number of bacteria along with extensive tissue damage. 7 Therefore, conventional smear microscopy acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear and culture showed low sensitivity resulting in relatively high rate of false negatives. 7, 22, 23 For examples, the sensitivity for microscopy is around 0%-40%. 7 Cultures which is a gold standard for tuberculosis diagnosis yielded wide variances in sensitivity for extrapulmonary tuberculosis; ie peritoneal biopsy (38-92%), liver biopsy (33-50%), and pericardial fluid (25-77%). 22 Another issue from cultures is long duration needed to obtain culture results and the need for specific facilities for culture, which may not be available in certain areas. 24 According to Lee et al in a literature review article, EPTB should depend on histopathology examination from biopsy in-order to confirm diagnosis. 7 Authors further added for peritoneal tuberculosis, biopsy from laparoscopic examination resulted in diagnostic yield of 85%-95%. 26 IGRA is a method to detect tuberculosis from level of interferon-\u03b3 released by Th1 cells. A study conducted in Indonesia demonstrated that IGRA yielded sensitivity of 87.71% and specificity of 63% for EPTB. 23 However, the study consisted of mainly lymph node tuberculosis (39 patients) and there were only 2 confirmed peritoneal tuberculosis patients. 23 Hence, sensitivity and specificity for peritoneal tuberculosis or other type of EPTB may be different.",

            "text": "Recently, CA-125, a common tumor marker for ovarian cancer diagnosis and follow-up, has been implicated to be associated with tuberculosis infection. [32] [33] [34] A small retrospective study by Fortun et al showed that CA-125 was increased in pulmonary tuberculosis patients when compared with EPTB patients. 35 According to the study, mean value of Ca-125 value was 104.9 IU/mL and based from the analysis of the study, the optimal cut-off value was 32.5 IU/mL that corresponded with sensitivity and specificity of 68.6% and 77.8% respectively. 35 Meanwhile, Kim et al conducted a study on 100 patients with active pulmonary tuberculosis. 32 Out of these patients, the authors observed that 38 out of 100 patients had elevated CA-125. It is interesting that they found female gender was associated with elevation of CA-125 compared to males. 32 However, the study included a significant proportion of young females that may cause higher CA-125 levels due to premenopausal status. Additionally, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that CA-125 has a potential role for pulmonary tuberculosis diagnosis but further studies should be conducted. 36 The role of CA-125 in extrapulmonary tuberculosis is still relatively uncertain due to lack of large studies. Chen et al compared 23 peritoneal tuberculosis patients and 47 primary peritoneal cancer on clinical characteristics. 25 Results of the study showed that both peritoneal tuberculosis and primary peritoneal cancer patients have elevated CA-125 levels. However, the elevation was statistically higher on primary peritoneal cancer patients. 25 The study did not observe age difference between the two diseases. This is in contrast with a study by Yin et al that found patients with peritoneal tuberculosis were younger than peritoneal mesothelioma cancer patients. 37 Another findings from the study is that peritoneal tuberculosis patients had higher proportions of pleural effusions, mesenteries, and abdominal visceral involvement. 37 As CA-125 is found in epithelial cells of endometrium, lung tissues, and mesothelial cells, there are other causes of CA-125 other than ovarian cancer. [38] [39] [40] This includes pulmonary cancer, breast cancer, pancreatic cancer, and gastrointestinal cancer. 36 Other conditions may include pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, uterine myoma, endometriosis, liver cirrhosis, and heart failure. 40 Patients with benign or malignant pleural effusions can also have elevated CA-125 levels. 41 ",

TB can also be found on sternum, cranium, and long bones. 47 Diagnosing skeletal TB can be difficult due to its insidious onset and back pain symptom which are often neglected by both the patient and clinician. Bone scans show elevated metabolism in skeletal TB, but this can also occur in other bacterial infection or metastases. A study by Sinan et al showed that majority of spinal tuberculosis lesions were fragmentary and lytic. 48 Biopsy shows caseating granuloma, but processing bone sample is difficult. 44 In our case, we first thought that the lesions on the bones of our patient indicated metastases. However, as explained above, further workups on cancer diagnosis did not reveal primary cancer locations. The bone lesions of our patient had predilection of skeletal TB such as vertebrae lesions with ribs, sternum, and long bones. Furthermore, there was mild narrowing of intervertebral disc of lumbar vertebra 4-5 and bulging disk which indicated tuberculosis infection. After TB treatment, some of the lesions become lytic sclerotic which may indicate healing process of the bone. Unfortunately, we did not conduct bone biopsy as the gold standard for skeletal TB is histopathological examination.",

This regimen has consistently been shown to reduce mortality and progression of the disease.

Meanwhile, if TB is located in the central nervous system, the duration of treatment is taken for 9-12 months. 55 An important consideration that should be taken when treating extrapulmonary tuberculosis is that intermittent dosing is not recommended due to lack of clinical trials. 55 Corticosteroid is generally not recommended in extrapulmonary tuberculosis with the exception of tuberculous meningitis. 55 For abdominal tuberculosis, there are currently lack of good quality studies to determine the evidence. 56 Mycobacterium Tuberculosis like all microorganisms has the capability for evolution. Thus, the bacterium may acquire drug resistance especially in patients with poor adherence. Identification of drug resistant Tuberculosis is important and this has been helped by molecular genetic testing such as GeneXpert and real time PCR. 57 Multidrugresistant TB (MDR TB) is defined as resistance of at least isoniazid and rifampin. 58 On the other hand, extensively drugresistant TB (XDR TB) is defined as resistance to either both isoniazid and rifampin together with at least one fluoroquinolone drug and at least one injectable drugs. 58 According to WHO guideline, patients with rifampicin-susceptible and isoniazid-resistant tuberculosis should be treated with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide and levofloxacin combination for at least 6 months. 59",
