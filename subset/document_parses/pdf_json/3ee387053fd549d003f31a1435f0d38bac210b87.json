            "text": "Entrenched inequalities in political participation have made the questions of who participates and when, why, or how some of the most frequently asked and researched in political science. Building on existing comparative research, this article focuses on civic education in English secondary schools and, in particular, the ability of related interventions to close participation gaps normally seen by sex, ethnicity and socio-economic status. Analysing original survey data collected from more than 350 students in 17 maintained secondary schools located in six regions of England, this article evaluates the impact of four types of civic education (curricula lessons; open classroom climate; participatory activities; and political contact) on three participatory outcomes (expressive political behaviours; voting intentions; and anticipated high-intensity participation). Descriptive and inferential analyses suggest (a) cumulative quantities of civic education are positively associated with youth political participation; (b) open classroom climate may close known inequalities in young people's expressive and electoral participation whilst political contact with politicians and political institutions may widen those inequalities; and (c) civic education may currently accelerate inequalities in young people's political ambition. These findings raise important and immediate challenges for policy-makers who are concerned with improving young people's civic engagement in England and elsewhere.",

            "text": "By participating in politics, citizens can make their interests known and pressure representatives or governing authorities to give them equal consideration (Dahl, 1989; Warren, 2002) . Widespread political participation thus undergirds the normative ideal-type of an inclusive democratic society, but it also correlates positively with practical indicators of effective and well-functioning national governments (notable examples being Norway, New Zealand, Canada and Denmark; see Dalton 2017) . In reality, however, the opportunities to participate in politics are not evenly distributed throughout populations (for overviews, see Teorell et al. 2007; Plutzer 2018) . For example, women are less likely to stand for political office than men, but they are more likely to participate in politics through informal or expressive behaviours (see Burns et al. 2001; Marien et al. 2010) . Younger cohorts of citizens are generally less represented at the ballot box or on the ballot paper, but do engage much more online and beyond party politics (e.g. Sloam and Henn 2018) . In turn, ethnic minority citizens are less likely to register to vote, turn out to vote, or to be descriptively represented in parliaments and legislatures in the US and across both Europe and the anglosphere (e.g. Bird et al. 2011; Heath et al. 2013) . 1 A growing repertoire of non-institutional or 'expressive' political behaviours also appears to entrench the formal participation gap seen between groups with low and high socioeconomic status (SES) (see Dalton 2017; OECD 2017, p. 166) .",

One avenue of investigation has centred upon civic education (elsewhere referred to as 'citizenship ', 'political' or 'democratic' education) . Civic education is used here as a holistic term that encompasses institutional and non-institutional mechanisms concerned with enhancing learners' abilities to handle evidence, articulate and substantiate arguments, engage critically with the social and political world, and understand key democratic concepts, issues and processes as well as their membership of local, national and global communities (for comparative discussions, see Davies et al. 2019) . Extant research suggests that civic education may increase young people's social capital, political knowledge and even political participation (Delli Carpini and Keeter 1996; Campbell 2006; Campbell and Niemi 2015 ; for a longitudinal review, see Knowles et al. 2018) . The importance of civic education in this respect can also be seen in policy documents such as the Council of Europe's 2018 Reference Framework of Competences for Democratic Culture (RFCDC) (Barrett 2020) .",

The author acknowledges that binary distinctions, including other frequently used terms like BME and BAME, are woefully inadequate. Future research should seek to disaggregate these terms in relation to citizenship education by acquiring sufficient sample sizes to better focus on understanding disparities and outcomes for specific ethnic groups. Hoskins et al. 2017) . To the extent that schooling is available to everyone in most contemporary states, school-based civic education can create or maintain political equality by developing young people's democratic knowledge, skills, and attitudes. In doing so, civic education may close the participatory gaps outlined above, which have been held up as reflective of both a 'civic opportunity gap' (see Clay and Rubin 2020 ) and a 'civic empowerment gap' (see Levinson 2013) . However, the precise mechanisms by which education per se, and civic education in particular, can improve political participation and overcome such inequalities remain rather opaque. For this reason, Campbell and Niemi (2015, p. 508) argue:",

Focusing on three types of civic education-formal curricula 'citizenship education', political contact, and participatory learning-and one style of delivery-open classroom climatethis article assesses the impact of school-based provision on young people's current likelihood of engaging in a range of expressive political behaviours and their future likelihood of engaging in a range of low and high intensity electoral behaviours. The contribution of the paper is twofold. On one hand, it provides a much-needed update to existing evidence on links between school-based civic education and young people's politics in England, which has been largely neglected since the end of the Citizenship Education Longitudinal Study (CELS) in 2010 as well as England's withdrawal from the International Civic and Citizenship Study (ICCS) after 2009 and the end of subject specific reports on curriculum citizenship education by Her Majesty's Inspectorate, Ofsted, in 2013. On the other hand, this article builds substantively on existing work in political science and education by (a) replicating research on well-known aspects of civic education (i.e. curricula provision, participatory activities, and open classroom climate), (b) providing original data on one previously under-researched aspect (i.e. political contact), and (c) evaluating the 'compensatory' effects of all four upon three 'tiers' of participation. These lines of inquiry and the findings that arise from them raise important questions for academics studying the relationship between education and politics as well as policy-makers, school leaderships and interested third sector stakeholders who seek to eradicate political inequality.",

For the benefit of the uninitiated, these may be summarised as follows. Firstly, formal learning manifests in curriculum-based lessons or opportunities that occur regularly as part of young people's ordinary education. These lessons tend to exhibit considerable comparative variation in line with the symbolic and ideological needs or preferences of national governments (e.g. Weinberg 2019). Second, participatory learning refers to forms of non-mandatory provision within schools such as student councils, debating societies or mock elections, all of which tend to be more elusive and dependent on school ethos than statutory curricula lessons (for analysis, see Keating and Janmaat 2016) . Thirdly, political contact-previously under-developed as a focus of civic education research-captures those interactive moments between young people and political actors or institutions that may be facilitated through the education system. Finally, OCC refers to the learning culture in a classroom with a particular focus on the extent to which young people are encouraged to debate, form and express individual opinions, and introduce issues for class discussion (see Martens and Gainous 2013; Quintelier and Hooghe 2013) .",

(Keating et al. 2010, p. vi) The general consensus of a dense comparative research base is, then, that the amount of civic education received in adolescence may stimulate higher levels of political participation (see also Whiteley 2014; Keating and Janmaat 2016 ). Yet as Donbavand and Hoskins (2021) rightly point out, these claims are largely reliant on observational data. Their systematic review of the field uncovered just 25 studies, mostly in the US and UK, that used controlled trials to isolate casual relationships. These studies do, however, reaffirm strong links between otherwise well-studied aspects of civic education (such as participatory approaches, teacher training, and whole school ethos) and young people's political engagement. Donbavand and Hoskins (2021, p. 15 ) conclude: 'the general picture is one which appears to broadly confirm the existing knowledge in the field'. These findings are expected to replicate for all students (i.e. young men and women, white students and ethnic minority students, and those with high and low SES) in the current study of contemporary civic education in English secondary schools.",

For example, Campbell and Niemi (2015) demonstrate disproportionate effects of highstakes civic education exams on the political knowledge of immigrant and Latino students in the US. Similarly, Campbell (2008) shows that 'exposure to an open classroom climate at school can partially compensate for the disadvantages faced by young people with low socioeconomic status' when it comes to anticipated voter turnout. Again using US data, Martens and Gainous 2013 find that OCC impacts low SES students' intent to vote (though to a smaller extent than Campbell), whilst Neundorf et al. (2016) use Belgian and US data to show compensation effects for students' interest in politics but not actual levels of political participation.",

These findings point to the important political socialisation provided by educational establishments such as universities. Whilst this is an important and positive finding, schools remain a more obvious and apposite site for related research into the compensation thesis. Very simply, secondary education is a universal right for all children, whilst higher education remains a selective experience (in 2020, entry rates for university places in England ranged from 32.6% of White British students to 71.7% of Chinese British students; see UK Government 2021).

In a study of Swedish panel data as well as ICCS data on 28 countries, Persson (2015) was unable to find consistent compensatory effects for civic education on political participation. There is, then, a need for more detailed and repeated investigation of this issue. Second, research into the compensation thesis focuses overwhelmingly on formal participation (and especially young people's voting intentions) without considering the potential impact of civic education on other high-intensity modes of participation (such as running for office) or a range of informal, expressive modes of participation (such as political consumerism, demonstrations and online activism). Third, extant research similarly tends to focus on one or two aspects of civic education (such as either OCC or curricula provision) without simultaneously considering a full framework of school-based activities that might influence political behaviours and attitudes.

It is anticipated that these effects will also manifest amongst young people who are visited by politicians in school or who have the opportunity to attend political institutions through school trips. In turn, it is expected that the compensation effects of political contact will be largest for high-intensity modes of formal participation such as standing for political office. Existing research has already shown, for example, that women and ethnic minority groups are more politically active when they are represented by women or ethnic minority politicians, and that such effects are magnified for young women exposed to new female candidates (Uhlaner and Scola 2016; Wolbrecht and Campbell 2007) .",

This exercise was entirely voluntary. Teachers were provided with detailed participant information sheets that they were asked to share with students and/or parents before administering the surveys.

The present sample is sufficient, however, for field-testing key hypotheses about civic education and political inequality that can inform larger replication studies. To improve the accuracy and generalisability of the results reported in the rest of this article, post-stratification weights for age, gender and ethnicity are applied to the data to bring it in line with published statistics on the national population of students in maintained secondary education at the time of data collection (DfE 2019).

Participants' scores were then averaged across all seven items to produce one aggregated variable. The same Likert scale was used to measure students' anticipated likelihood of voting in a national election when aged 18 or older as well as their likelihood of joining a political party, helping to campaign for a politician, or standing for election themselves. Scores for these latter three behaviours are aggregated into an average likelihood for future high-intensity participation. Table 1 also reports frequencies, chi-square associations and correlation coefficients for each participatory behaviour by gender, ethnicity and SES. The data indicate that (a) young people in England are not particularly likely to participate in most political behaviours and (b) testify to inequalities in political participation documented in adult populations. For example, young women are more likely to engage in expressive modes of participation, but the differences between young men and women disappear when it comes to high-intensity forms of participation such as campaigning for a political party or standing for office. Equally, white students and high-SES students are also more likely than their ethnic minority or low SES peers to participate in a range of expressive political behaviours; more likely to anticipate voting in the future; and more likely to anticipate joining a political party or campaigning in an election.",

This article follows the example of existing research with school children by measuring SES using a home environment index (see Gainous and Martens 2012). Put simply, SES is measured as a composite variable based upon (a) the number of books in a students' home (measured on a five-point Likert scale) and (b) students' self-reported level of political socialisation with family members (also scored on a five-point Likert scale). Participants in this study were drawn from very different SES backgrounds. For example, 41% had fewer than 25 books in their household (and 18% had fewer than 10), whilst 20% self-reported more than 200. Some 30% of participants had 'never or hardly ever' spoken about 'social or political issues' at home with family or friends, but 20% did so on a daily or almost daily basis. Knowles et al. (2018, p. 21) argue that 'future research could consider the nature of classroom composition.' Over and above students' individual attributes, it is entirely possible that classrooms or schools with particularly homogeneous or heterogenous student populations are more or less conducive to effective civic education. To account for school composition in subsequent inferential analyses, a binary variable is devised here based on the percentage of students claiming free school meals (FSM) in each participant's school. At the time of data collection, children in England were eligible for FSM if they came from a household that (a) had an annual gross income of \u00a316,190 or less, or (b) was in receipt of income-related support, tax credits or Universal Credit. Where more than one in five students (i.e. 20% of the school population) claimed FSM, participants' schools are classified as having high levels of socio-economic deprivation. In total, 131 participants attended seven schools with low percentages of FSM (i.e. < 20% of the student population) and 232 attended ten schools with high percentages of FSM.",

The first presents descriptive statistics on students' self-reported levels of received civic education across individual items. These data provide a snapshot of the 'state-of-play' in civic education provision amongst the present sample. The second section amalgamates students' average scores for curricula civic education lessons, participatory activities, political contact and OCC (as per Table 1 ) into a single sum score, which is then rescaled 0-1 for the sample population and split into three near equally populated categories of 'weakest provision' (scores up to half a standard deviation below the mean, N = 112), 'moderate provision' (scores one standard deviation around the mean, N = 108), and 'strongest provision' (scores above half a standard deviation over the mean, N = 115). This composite variable is used to assess the relationship between students' cumulative quantity of received civic education and their participatory outcomes by sex, ethnicity and SES (as per Hypothesis 1). These comparisons are supported in-text by the results of multiple factor (two-way) ANOVAs. The third and final section of the analysis tests hypotheses 2-5 using weighted least squares multiple regressions. Cluster robust standard errors are also used to account for heteroskedacity across groups of students located at different school sites. These models are used to assess the differential effects of each aspect of civic education upon (a) expressive participation, (b) anticipated voter turnout, and (c) political ambition (as the apogee of high-intensity participation). These three analyses are each run using subsets of the data so that the strength of pathway coefficients for different sub-samples (high/low SES, men/women, ethnic minority/white students) can be compared whilst controlling for potential differences in access to provision, socio-economic and demographic characteristics, and school composition (see Online Appendix).",

For example, the 2019 School Workforce Census (DfE 2020) found that out of 2876 English secondary schools, only 456 reported having a trained citizenship education teacher. Where schools did report teaching curriculum citizenship education, it accounted for just 1.9% of teaching hours. Returning to the present study, participatory activities appear equally scarce in English schools. Only 18% of students had voted on topical issues at school once a fortnight or more in the last year; 20% had never voted for a student representative; and 32% had never been given the chance to participate in decisionmaking about how their school is run.

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) Fig. 6 Predicted effects of open classroom climate on the expressive participation of students with low socio-economic status (original scales) scores suggest acceptable levels of collinearity among the predictors used in each model (VIF < 3).

A single unit increase in OCC results in an average 7% increase in students' voting intentions (e.g. Fig. 7) . These effects are also stronger among low SES students (8%) than high SES students (4%), which is again indicative of a compensation effect (H4 supported). However, there is no discernible relationship between voting intent and whole curricula lessons (H2 unsupported), and participatory activities even share a marginal negative association with the voting intentions of some students (H3 unsupported). Political contact appears to share a nuanced relationship with students' voting intentions. On average, each one-unit increase in political contact results in a 4% decrease in the voting intentions of ethnic minority students (H5 unsupported), but a 4% increase among young women (H5 supported). However, age is the strongest predictor of voting intent in these models regardless of students' socio-economic status, sex or ethnicity. Students in Key Stage 4 (15-16 years old) are, on average, 13-28% more likely to anticipate voting in an election than their peers in Key Stage 3 at the start of secondary education (11-12 years old). These findings mirror the aggregate increases in political interest evidenced elsewhere across adolescence and young adulthood (e.g. Neundorf et al. 2013) .",

In particular, young people appear to be more likely (or less unlikely) to aspire to political office when they experience political contact in school. On average, each one-unit increase in the frequency of political contact through schooling is associated with a 25% increase in political ambition. However, these effects once again vary by student characteristics. For example, political contact appears to benefit high SES students more than low SES students, and it has a much stronger effect among white students by comparison to ethnic minority students. Each one-unit increase in political contact correlates with a 38% rise in political ambition among white students (e.g. Fig. 8 ), but only 7% among ethnic minority students. It is possible, therefore, that political contact may have an acceleration effect on inequalities in young people's political ambition (H5 unsupported).",

This acceleration effect is mirrored by statistically significant positive correlations between OCC and political ambition among high SES and white students that do not reproduce among low SES students or ethnic minority students (H4 unsupported).

            "text": "The positive associations found here between OCC and various participatory outcomes echo prior research findings from around the world and, in doing so, affirm the importance of teachers' pedagogic practices in the classroom. Often in contrast to the highly divisive political rhetoric of populist politicians and pundits that young people may encounter online or through the news media, OCC engages students in civil discussion and deliberation about competing viewpoints and 'open questions' (see, in particular, McAvoy and Hess 2013). In doing so, OCC can help students to become more informed, more interested and more politically tolerant through deliberative interactions with teachers and peers from quite different social, cultural or political backgrounds (McAvoy et al. 2011; Torney-Purta et al. 2001) . These experiences may also, as evidenced here and elsewhere, have a particularly powerful effect on the participatory intentions of young people from under-represented social backgrounds with little or no political socialisation outside of school. 2 As a previously under-researched form of civic education, it seems that political contact may also be a powerful predictor of young people's political participation. It may, however, accelerate known inequalities in participation. In particular, political contact through schooling shares stronger associations with the expressive participation and political ambition of white students and high-SES students than ethnic minority or low SES students. The findings presented here even suggest that it may stymie the voting intentions of young ethnic minority students. This is a worrying and counter-hypothetical finding that possibly says as much about the descriptive quality of the UK's political class and democratic institutions as it does about the potential impacts of political contact per se. Research on minority empowerment has demonstrated that both a dyadic mapping of descriptive representation between citizen and legislator, as well as collective descriptive representation in legislatures, can increase voter registration, turnout, political interest and efficacy, and informal participation among underrepresented groups (see Uhlaner and Scola 2016 ). Yet young ethnic minority students in the UK are unlikely to see themselves, or their social and cultural experiences, mirrored in the representatives and representative institutions of UK politics. As of the 2019 General Election, only 10% of MPs, 4% of councillors, and 12.7% of civil servants (including only 6% of senior civil servants) were from ethnic minority backgrounds (compared to 33% of students currently in maintained secondary education in England). On one hand, these findings raise interesting questions for future research into the potentially negative or suppressive impact of non-descriptive political contact (with institutions as well as actors) upon minority empowerment among young people. On the other hand, they highlight the possibly beneficial impact of descriptive political contact as a form of civic education.",

            "text": "A similar logic may explain the negative associations found here between curricula citizenship education lessons and the political ambition of young ethnic minority and low SES students. Put simply, it is possible that mainstream political education about non-descriptive political institutions, as well as contact with those institutions, positions a white middle-class relationship to state authority that jars with the precarity and lived experiences of ethnic minority and workingclass young people. This is an argument with a longstanding heritage in debates about formal citizenship education in England. In the late 2000s, the then Labour Government were criticised by teachers and academics alike for using citizenship education to promote a compromisingly monocultural view of Britishness (e.g. Osler 2008; Hand and Pearce 2008) . Subsequent Coalition and Conservative governments have been similarly criticised for advancing a depoliticised curriculum of personal 'responsibilisation' that focuses more on building social capital than political literacy or active citizenship (e.g. Kisby 2017; Weinberg and Flinders 2018) . In contrast to the politics of citizenship education as they've played out in England, Beth Rubin (2007) calls for 'a critical, asset-based approach [to civic education] that is attentive to both community and larger structural and historical context.' This is an important invective that points to a way forward. It is entirely possible that curricula citizenship education and political contact may yet raise the political interests and ambition of all young people, but only once our political institutions and processes (and the courses designed to teach about them) more adequately reflect the social, cultural and ethnic composition and experiences of the whole country.",

Future research may seek to develop a more sophisticated understanding of this result and the broader political impact of civic education by incorporating known by-products such as political knowledge and democratic attitudes (e.g. Schulz et al. 2016, p. 193; Barrett 2020) . It is entirely possible that types and styles of civic education do not positively impact participatory outcomes because young people receive them per se, but because they foremost develop students' knowledge (i.e. about when and how to participate) and democratic orientation (i.e. why to participate) where they are done well. Future studies should seek to test these assumptions with larger samples of longitudinal or experimental observations, as well as controlled trials, that allow for appropriate causal mediation analyses and control for the quality of civic education teaching in schools.",
