            "text": "The application, timing, and duration of lockdown strategies during a pandemic remain poorly quantified with regards to expected public health outcomes. Previous projection models have reached conflicting conclusions about the effect of complete lockdowns on COVID-19 outcomes. We developed a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model with eight states including the environment (SEAMHQRD-V), and derived a formula for the basic reproduction number, R 0 , for that model. Applying the R 0 formula as a function in previously-published social contact matrices from 152 countries, we produced the distribution and four categories of possible R 0 for the 152 countries and chose one country from each quarter as a representative for four social contact categories (Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger). The model was then used to predict the effects of lockdown timing in those four categories through the representative countries. The analysis for the effect of a lockdown was performed without the influence of the other control measures, like social distancing and mask wearing, to quantify its absolute effect. Hypothetical lockdown timing was shown to be the critical parameter in ameliorating pandemic peak incidence. More importantly, we found that well-timed lockdowns can split the peak of hospitalizations into two smaller distant peaks while extending the overall pandemic duration. The timing of lockdowns reveals that a \"tunneling\" effect on incidence can be achieved to bypass the peak and prevent pandemic caseloads from exceeding hospital capacity.",

            "text": "Model description. We used an SEAMHQRD-V disease transmission model to depict the spread of SARS-CoV 2 (the cause of in the community, and within households. The model is constructed from a stochastic continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) with eight states or compartments: susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected but asymptomatic (A), mildly infected and symptomatic (M), severely infected, symptomatic and hospitalized (H), detected and quarantined (Q), recovered (R), and dead (D) (Fig. 1) . The equivalent number of infected persons represented by deposition of virus particles by infected persons (A + M) in the environment is denoted by V, with removal of virus from the environment by \u03c1. Compartments were split into three age groups: children (0-18 years), denoted by a (c) subscript, adults (19-64 years) denoted by an (a) subscript, and senior (65 years and more), denoted by an (s) subscript. The possible transitions of individuals between compartments are represented by arrows with rates given above the arrows in Fig. 1 . The subpopulation sizes are denoted by N c , N a , and N s , respectively, and they add up to the total population size N which is assumed to be fixed. See the supplementary material (S1. Model Description) for full description and Table S3 for definition of model's parameters. We used the methods introduced by Allen and van den Driessche 29 to derive R 0 for the CTMC model by approximating it by a multi-type branching process 29 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ We used the CTMC to simulate different epidemiological measures and find their statistics. The first measure was the actual incidence, defined to be the proportion of the newly infected individuals to the population every day over the course of the epidemic. The second measure was the total attack rate, defined as the fraction of people that contract the disease in an at-risk population over the epidemic period. The third measure is hospital case load, defined to be the fraction of the population that is hospitalized for COVID-19 treatment at any given time and find its peak. We used the total population as the denominator for all of the measures so as to be able to compare between different counties with different population sizes.",

Applying household-level demographic and health survey data from the 152 countries to Markov chain Monte Carlo simulations, they produced five different types of social contact rates for various settings: work, school, home, other and all. The resulting social contact matrices were available for 5-year age increments from age 0 to 80.",

We assumed that environmental contact matrix is a proportion r of the all-contact matrix. The home contact matrix was normalized by the number of household members in each age group 32 .

For this procedure, it was assumed that the probability of infection is the same in all situations and places. Quartiles of R 0 split the countries into four groups (see S3. Countries Categorization for more details). We picked one country from each one of the four categories, that would also fall in a different continent: Canada, China, Mexico, and Niger; increasing from the lowest to the highest social contact category. The choice of countries taken from the four quartile groups serve two purposes. First, the country chosen represented its quartile. Secondly, we attempted to choose representative countries that would showcase the diversity of social contacts given widely varying lifestyle conditions, GDP, and geography. We chose Canada (North America, G-7 country), China (Asian region) Mexico (North America, non-G7 country) and Niger (African region, low income country). Moreover, each of the four chosen quartile countries employed lockdowns of different stringency, timing, and duration.",

It is known that the size of the epidemic has a chance to be zero in CTMC models 35 , which we exclude given that attack rates cannot, epidemiologically, have a value of zero and the COVID-19 virus has already a significant potential to spread between individuals. In all the simulations, the initial number of infected individuals was assumed to be one adult who is mildly infected. The list of parameters of the model, their description and values are shown in Table S3 . Some of the parameters were found in the literature or guesstimated by experts and the rest of the parameters are found using calibration. We calibrated the model using the mean scenario that was estimated by 36 to be R 0 = 6.47 since the model's structure in 36 is very close to our model. That value was also very close to the mean value of the 152 values of R 0 shown in Figure S1 . We used that value for all the chosen countries to factor out the effect of the reproduction rate of secondary cases on the influence of the lockdown, thus allowing us to compare between the four countries. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ To make a run-by-run comparison of the course of the epidemic with and without the lockdown, we simulated the model using a fixed random seed for each one of the 1000 runs. In all those runs, we assumed that the only control measure is the complete lockdown starting before the peak of the actual incidence and for a specified period. The comparison of the effect of the start of the lockdown was done using two measures, which compute the relative reduction of measure X, RD(X), in R 0 , the total attack rate, and peak of hospitalization for the nonzero simulation runs with the following formula, where X 0 is the epidemiological quantity ( R 0 , attack rate or peak of hospitalization) under no control measure and X lockdown is the same measure with the lockdown. The mean, median and 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles of RD were calculated for the two measures. We also simulated the actual incidence and hospitalized normalized by the total population sizes for visual comparisons.",

Starting the lockdown 15 days before the actual incidence's peak results in a tunneling effect of the incidence curve as seen in the simulation runs and their average, Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8b (see also Fig. S4) , which resulted in a decrease in the magnitude of the attack rates. The tunneling effect appears as a theoretical solution in environmental Kuznets curves of pollution emission 37 . Here it also results in dividing the flux of cases arriving at hospitals into two distinct, smaller peaks which would allow hospitals to deal with a smaller initial peak before restocking for the second smaller peak, Figs. 5, 6, 7, 8c,d. Dividing the peak of hospitalization into two smaller peaks creates a more manageable outbreak scenario. Thus, hospitals can \"divide and conquer\" the expected larger peak of cases with a well-timed lockdown.

Our modeling shows the benefit of an accurately timed lockdown which results in a tunneling effect and can provide relief by avoiding overwhelming the hospitals, the public health response capabilities and the health care system. However, the lockdown, while reducing case load, can be expected to extend the duration of the epidemic. Extending its duration could result in unforeseen outcomes in healthcare such as higher immediate healthcare costs (e.g. extended need for personal protective equipment, testing kits, laboratory diagnostics, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ and increased intense hospital cleaning), decreased utilization of healthcare services for other diseases resulting in worse outcomes and increased mortality (e.g., reduced cancer screening or treatment for heart disease or diabetes), increased incidence of psychological outcomes (e.g., suicide), and health care worker psycho-social impacts (stress, fatigue, and burn out) which may need further evaluation when applying the results of this model. One important limitation of compartmental models, as used in this paper, are less suitable to model household infection dynamics since homes have limited numbers of individuals and once infected, they are removed from the ongoing epidemic. This modeling weakness is difficult to incorporate by compartmental models in general, so incidence may be overestimated. On the other hand, since household contact rates tend to increase during lockdowns the resulting incidence might also increase, counter-balancing this issue; which we did not incorporate in this model trying to overcome some of the inherent limitations to this type of compartmental modeling of household transmission. Also, all timing scenarios in this paper are subjected to the same limitation and so the qualitative rather than quantitative findings of the paper are to be considered.",
