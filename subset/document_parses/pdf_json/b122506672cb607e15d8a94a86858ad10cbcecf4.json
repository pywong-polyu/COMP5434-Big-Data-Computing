This has caused critical challenges in daily human life and has burdened health care systems with an increasing need for adequate healthy staff, ventilators, diagnostic testing, and personal protective equipment. 2 These unprecedented circumstances have also presented a challenge for the conduct of clinical trials. The paramount concern is the dreaded possibility of dissemination of the virus among-but not limited to-clinical trial participants, other patients, and health care workers. Furthermore, shortages of medical and support staff, inadequate monitoring, travel restrictions, interruptions of supply chains for investigated products, shortages of medical equipment and personal protective equipment, uncertainty over continued funding, and restrictions imposed by sponsoring institutions are some of the many obstacles facing clinical trials during the pandemic.",

Clinical investigators should assess the risk-benefit ratio of conducting the study and whether the study's benefit to patients outweighs the potential harm imposed by COVID-19. This decision should be made in light of whether local transmission of COVID-19 is controlled, patients' medical status, clinical response, investigational product availability, and institutional, state, and federal regulations. Indeed, this decision could be individualized to each participant's condition and clinical status. When feasible, investigators may consider the use of virtual visits and telemedicine as alternatives to in-person clinical visits. If diagnostic assessments (eg, labs and imaging) are required and/or medications require administration in a health care setting, local centers and providers could be an alternative. For example, if a participant who requires in-hospital infusion of an investigational drug is not able to come to the clinical trial site, an arrangement for home infusion by trained personnel should be considered. However, the safety of the investigational product and adequate storage conditions should be assessed and monitored on a regular basis. When the risk of COVID-19 limits the ability to obtain signed informed consent, electronic methods could be employed, among other provisions to enable online study enrollment. Information technology could also be used to allow on-site monitoring given travel limitations and inadequate staffing.",

Studies may deviate from the original protocol's frequency of clinical visits, lab testing, imaging, and other interventions. Any modifications to protocols or any missing information as a result of the pandemic (eg, missed visits or testing) should be clearly documented in a way that explains the reason for the deviation from the original protocol (eg, ''due to COVID-19'') and reported to the institutional review board. Changes that are intended to reduce or eliminate COVID-19's risk to patients' lives could be implemented before institutional review board or Food and Drug Administration approval. 4 Patients should be kept informed and updated about all study changes.",
