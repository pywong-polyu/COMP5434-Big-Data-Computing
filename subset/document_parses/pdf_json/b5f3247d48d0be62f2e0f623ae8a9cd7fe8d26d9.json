The state of South Carolina in the USA has seen cases since early March 2020 and a primary peak in early April 2020. A lockdown was imposed on April 6 th but lifting of restrictions started on April 24 th . The daily case and death data as reported by NCHS (deaths) via the New York Times GitHUB repository have been analyzed and approaches to modeling of the data are presented.

            "text": "The Covid 19 pandemic has spread across the world since the beginning of 2020. In the US there has been a large increase of cases (symptomatic) and deaths attributable to Covid19. Many serious issues remain about predictive modeling, interventions and vaccines (for a recent overview see Banks et al, 2020) . Various data sources are now available that provide daily counts of cases and fatalities for this disease. In this report we demonstrate the use of a Bayesian susceptible-Infect-removed model with spatial geo-referencing at the county level in South Carolina. The model specifies a transmission rate within each county as well as optionally including neighboring county transmissions. Asymptomatic cases are assumed to be a proportion of symptomatic and are included in the transmission model. An accounting equation is assumed where the susceptible population is decremented by infectives and removals. Predictions based on this model are possible, but the focus of this paper is mainly on the model development and fitting. As the pandemic of Covid-19 develops, a variety of approaches to modeling its spread are being presented ( e. g. Calavetti et al, 2020; Calafiore, 2020; Rouabah et a; . Many of these models are time series-based, and do not incorporate spatial structure in the modeling process. Within Bayesian modeling, few published examples exist where the asymptomatic process is modelled (Zhou et al , 2020) . However it is clear that cross boundary transmission must occur (at least at the county level) and so ignoring this must limit the ability of the models to account for this feature. In addition the use of random effects to allow for confounding is often ignored. In the present approach we examine a range of models with different assumptions about transmission and spatial dependence both in terms of fixed predictors and",

First it is clear that for the early unsmoothed data the large increase in risk in late March-early April favored a large asymptomatic rate and time dependence. This is likely due to the large variation over time from zero counts to high incidence. For the later period from April 2 nd to June 29 th an asymptomatic rate of 25% yielded a better fit and a model with both the poverty covariate and spatial residual CAR effect were best for either the crude data or the smoothed data. In general the smoothed data support a lower asymptomatic rate of 25%, inclusion of the county level poverty covariate and spatial structure, either as a spatially-structured intercept (model 5) or as a residual confounding (model 3). This further suggests that in the earlier period the time dependence in the risk in the unsmoothed data was heterogeneous with respect to county differences and so for the smoothed data spatial differentiation of risk was more obvious. Figure 13 displays the residual spatial ICAR effect for model 3 for the smoothed April-June data set. It is clear that the counties with greatest residual risk unexplained are rural in nature: the urban areas have much lower and negative residual effect. Figure 14 displays the spatially structured ICAR intercept effect for model 5 for the Jan-April smoothed data. This suggests that transmission is differentiated spatially and is higher in rural areas. .

This may suggest that at county level the resolution level does not support cross-boundary transmission. Finally it is also clear that % under the poverty line as a covariate is significant in these models so that regions of higher % poverty contribute more to the risk variation.",

Further some patients may not attend for Covid-19 screening even if they are in fact positive for the disease. In addition the under-ascertainment could be spatially and temporally differentiated in that it could vary over time and between areas. For normal influenza seasons, health departments often use a scale factor to allow for the iceberg effect of not observing the true case load, when only lab confirmed cases are presented. This could be added for Covid-19 of course. As an alternative the true case load could be included within a Bayesian model as a latent effect.",

However as the focus here was on infection spread and case counts it has been assumed that death count is given and assumed fixed.",

            "text": "1) Smoothed data (at least 3 day averaged data) can yield different results from crude unsmoothed count data, especially with respect to time dependence and spatial smoothing. Smoothed data could induce greater spatial correlation and this was highlighted above. 2) The asymptomatic rate was varied in these models and was found to best fit when it was high (50%) for early unsmoothed data with a large spike in risk. More commonly 25% rate was favored for later data and the smoothed 3 day average data in general. CDC2020 lists a range of rates but cites 40% as the current best estimate 3) Poverty does provide better explanation of risk variation in these county level examples, and hence its surrogates of unemployment, low median income, and ethnicity differences could also be assumed to play a role. These additional predictors have not been included here but may help to reduce the residual spatial structure in the risk variation. 4) The value of spatio-temporal Bayesian modeling lies in the ability to flexible add both observed explanatory variables and unobserved latent effects to model disease risk. In our models we have achieved a reasonable measure of fit and made comparisons of different models with different assumptions, provided insight into asymptomatic rate and spatial differentiation of risk. The role of poverty is also clear. The ability to add crossboundary transmission as a gravity effect is also a feature of the modeling, although in this case this was not selected in the best model.",
