HIV-self-test (HIVST) coupled with counselling and AIDS-care, including antiretroviral therapy, has the potential to achieve this. However, national programs are at varying stages of acceptance of HIVST, as discussions around its introduction spark controversy and debates. HIV-self-test, as yet, is not part of the AIDS control program in India. Against this backdrop, we explored acceptability of an HIV oral self-test (HIVOST) among truckers and young men and women. Methods: A qualitative investigation with 41 in-depth-interviews and 15 group discussions were conducted in the district of Pune, in the western state of Maharashtra, India. These interactions were built around a prototype HIVOST kit, helped in taking the discussions forward. The software N-vivo (version 11.0) was used to manage the volumes of data generated through the aforementioned process. The study was conducted during June through December, 2019.",

'Ease of doing HIVOST' and 'fear of needle pricks' were the reasons behind acceptance around HIVOST by both the study groups. Truckers felt that HIVOST would encourage one to know one's HIV status and seek help as appropriate. Accuracy of HIVOST result and disposal of the kits following use were concerns of a few. Most of the participants preferred saliva over blood as the specimen of choice. Instructions in local language reportedly would enable test-use by self. The truck drivers preferred undertaking HIVOST at the truckers-friendly 'Khushi clinics' or in the vehicle, while youths preferred the privacy of home. Some of the young men mis-perceived the utility of HIVOST by referring to doing a test on a partner immediately prior to sexual encounter. On the other hand, a few truckers had wrong information on HIV cure.",

However, there are still pockets, where HIV is concentrated among the key population groups namely female sex workers (FSW; 1.56%), people who inject drugs (PWID; 6.26%), men having sex with men (MSM; 2.69%) and transgender community (TG; 3.14%) [1] . This was the case even in the early days of the epidemic barring six states (Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Manipur and Nagaland), where a generalized epidemic was witnessed [2] . More than 1% antenatal clinic (ANC) clinic attending women, were detected with HIV in these states indicating wider spread of the virus beyond most at risk population (MARP) groups [3] . Based on such observations, the targeted intervention (TI) programs were designed, in the long run such an approach has been evaluated to be cost effective [4] . Overall goal of these TI programs in various states was to reduce the vulnerability of the above cited population groups to HIV and other sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and to establish a linkage with HIV care.",

            "text": "The risk of bridge populations such as long distant truckers, migrant workers and other clients of sex workers to HIV was also recognized during the early phase of the AIDS control program in India and interventions were designed to address them as well. The relevance of this approach was underlined by the epidemiologic link, which was established behind the spread of HIV from MARP groups to general population through bridge groups [5] . However, HIV intervention focus, currently directed towards bridge population is not as intense as it used to be earlier. Decreasing HIV prevalence in India in the recent past during 2005 to 2010 might be contributing to such reduced attention [6] . What is of concern though, that the HIV prevalence is refusing to go further down since 2010 [7] . Worth noting against this background is that approximately 69,000 new HIV infections took place in India in 2019 [8] . What is known is that the HIV prevalence among truck drivers is at 0.86% which is about 3 times higher than the national average adult HIV prevalence [9] . However, age specific HIV prevalence data pertaining to young adults in India is sparse. Considered together, these information not only underline that the residual risks of HIV that exist in the country, but also the need for urgent intervention development. Failing to do so, will negatively impact upon the targets of 95:95:95 to be achieved by 2030. Such targets require 95% of the people living with HIV knowing their status, of whom at least 95% will be put on anti-retroviral therapy (ART) and 95% of those on ART would achieve undetectable HIV viral load [10] .",

Despite such initiatives, delayed linking of truckers to HIV test and treatment has been noted [15] . As with truckers, vulnerability of adolescents and young adults to HIV in India has also been documented although they did not feature in the MARP groups. Such vulnerabilities of the youths arise either from their patronage to FSWs or exploration in unsafe drug use practices [16] . A study in 2014, among adolescents (15-19 year) in Delhi, the capital city, revealed that more than 45% of them were exposed to high-risk sexual behaviors [17] . However, studies in the recent times focusing on the vulnerability of truckers and youths to HIV have been few. Noticeably, HIV selftest has the potential to play a key role for these population groups where the threat of infection does not appear obvious to individuals.",

Acceptability of HIV self-test was explored by carrying out content analysis of both the transcribed and translated responses. A separate codebook was developed for each of the study groups based on the domains explored. Short descriptions of the codes and quotes around them was compiled. This was reviewed periodically and reorganized to identify major or minor themes (categories). The data analysts, with assistance from the research supervisors and other team members helped to resolve the coding discrepancies, if any. Among the other methods, in-vivo coding was used to capture the voices and concerns of the study participants. The field notes prepared by the interviewers before and after their interactions with study participants helped in gathering sufficient reflexivity. N-vivo software (version 11.0) was used to help in organizing the responses and subsequent analysis.",

Young adults in the current study mentioned that they would prefer taking HIV self-test in privacy of their homes. This was similar to the findings emerging from South Africa. In Mozambique, adolescents preferred taking the test at youth-friendly clinics [37] [38] [39] .",
