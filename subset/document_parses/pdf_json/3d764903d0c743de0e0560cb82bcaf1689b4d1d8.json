It represents 10% of the cancer mortality rate each year [2] . Unfortunately, based on the data collected so far, it is estimated that the number of patients affected by this disease will increase considerably in the years to come. One of the main causes for the increasing incidence of the condition is the ever-increasing rate of ageing of the population. In addition, cancer-related death has increased by 45% in recent years and there is a high chance that the rate will rise to 60% over the next 15 years [2] . It is estimated that the market value for colon cancer therapies will reach as high as $11 billion by year 2025 due to the increase of branded therapies.",

In the current form such analysis is made by clinicians. It is certainly difficult to take all that information into account and to establish a result with great accuracy. In addition, human error occurs due to various factors having an impact on doctors. To reach a more precise diagnosis, many specialists should meet, analyze and agree on common grounds. Obviously this method is not feasible in everyday life. What if every doctor had all the knowledge of specialists at hand without requiring their physical presence? It would certainly help and increase the success rate of the resulting diagnoses by decreasing human error. The proposed solution aims to rely also on previous colon cancer cases, which have been carefully examined and to which we have the certainty of diagnosis. In other words, past cases are situations where a diagnosis has been made, and with time, it has also been confirmed whether the decision made was correct or not. This data can serve as a solid research foundation, in the direction of identifying the essential factors that trigger this pathology.",

They used two deep convolutional networks. The first is necessary for the separation of the background from the glands, and the second identifies the different structures of the glands, dividing them into two categories: malignant or benign. The architecture of the two convolutional neural networks was inspired by the classic LeNet-5 network, first developed in 1998 by LeCun et al. in [4] and originally designed to recognise handwritten figures. The used network contains seven layers: four convolutional filtered and three fully connected layers. ReLU functions are used as activation functions throughout the network. Concerning the training process, the random mini-lot method with gradient drop, with 200 images per epoch, was used until the stopping criteria were met. The used data set consisted of 165 images containing properly labelled malignant and benign tissues. The results obtained were over 95% accurate.",

            "text": "In [5] it was demonstrated that the aggressiveness of colorectal cancer is directly influenced by gland formations. Therefore, in order to have the most relevant classification Xinghazi Yue et al. [6] came to the conclusion that there was a significant increase in the algorithm's performance when the concept of transfer learning was applied. By using this concept, the training becomes much faster and the predictions become more accurate, in comparison to training the network from scratch. The parameter values are chosen in such a way that the early layers manage to learn the more general characteristics and the deeper layers focus on the characteristics specific to the problem in question [6] . The more general traits are: edges, contour, shadows, and in terms of specific characteristics: types of tissue, cells, polyps. Reference [6] also discussed the possibility of predicting the chances of survival of at least 5 years after surgery, analyzing histological images. They applied the principles of Reinhard normalisation [7] and the principal component analysis (PCA) method in order to reduce the dimensionality of the data set by preserving the most relevant characteristics. The authors of work [8] applied the idea to use normalized images instead of high resolution original images, which is hard to be processed. They proposed removing from the dataset the regions containing less than 30% tissue or having excessive blood. To reduce the probability of the system being over-trained, the data augmentation concept can be applied to the data pool. This involves applying geometric operations, such as turning 90 degrees, horizontal or vertical reflections, or applying blurred Gaussian filters [6] . The purpose of these operations is to help the algorithm become invariant to different rotations or shades of the same regions, to be able to focus on what is important, without waiting for the data set to be perfectly served [8] . A non-supervised learning method was used for the zone classification part because there was no set of labels that could have corresponded to well-defined classes, and the human work required to do so would have been too costly. The k-means-cluster algorithm was used, which operates by the following principle: k cluster centroids were chosen and points were assigned to them, choosing the centroid closest to that point. To increase the robustness of the algorithm, different randomly initialised parameters were applied and continued with the set that generates the smallest loss [8] . The structure of the chosen network by Yue et al. in [6] was inspired by the well-known VGG16 and adapted to fit the current requirements of the problem. VGG16 is a convoluted network developed by K. Simonyan and A. Zisserman in [8] that managed to reach an accuracy of 92.7% on a data set of 14 million images, belonging to 1000 distinct classes. The conclusion reached in [6] is that five clusters are the most suitable and easily to interpret model: Cluster 0: out of tissue; Cluster 1: contains red blood cells; Cluster 2: contains cancer cells and antibodies; Cluster 3: empty; Cluster 4: contains fat. The authors aim is to predict the lifespan of patients without requiring prior work by doctors to prepare a database of appropriate images and labels [6] .",

G. Urban et al. aimed to identify polyps in the patient colonoscopies. Unlike previous works, [3, 6] , in which histological images were analyzed, in [9] the object studied was a set of images captured in real time during the colonoscopy process. Thus, the authors applied the concepts of supervised learning, using deep convolutional networks, with randomly initialised parameters, but also with parameters already calculated after training on other data sets. They also tried different architectures whose foundations were similar in many aspects: convolutional layers, densely connected, dimensional reduction, non-linear activation functions (RELU) and normalisation operations. The main difference was made at the last layer, when it was adapted according to the desired result: binary classification or framing in a rectangular form of polyps. In the second case, being a regression problem, the performance criterion was quantified using the L2 function (root mean square). While for the first binary classification situation, the authors used the Kullback-Leibler criterion [10] (assess the percentage of lost information using an approximation). To reduce the chances of the model becoming over-fitted, the authors introduced dropout layers in addition to the original structure. The purpose of these layers was to deactivate neurons in a non-predictable way, with the probability of 0.5 which translates as the probability of each neuron being disabled at each iteration is 50% [11] . Studies have also shown that the introduction of these layers improves the system robustness and eliminates dependencies between neurons [11] .",

They also focused on data augmentation and its impact on model performance. Training a convolutional neural network requires a large amount of data to deliver satisfactory results. As an example, the AlexNet model [23] was developed and trained using a database of 1.2 million images to be able to successfully identify different objects.

The total number of epochs was 10, the learning rate was 3 \u00b7 10 \u22124 , and the data were randomly mixed at the beginning of each era. Thus this avoided the model becoming over-trained by learning a specific data sequence and in addition due to the optimisation method, which was based on the principle of finding the minimum by choosing random values, increasing the training speed. The parameters performed in Matlab \u00ae are listed in Table 1 . Batch size (miniBatchSize) was chosen as 10. It was a sub-set of the training set and used to evaluate the gradient and modify parameters accordingly [31] , after all 10 images were propagated forward through layers. Generally, a suitable value was desired, which was as far away from 1 as possible because too small batches require too many calculations and in addition the model tends towards over-training. On the other hand, the high values overload the available computational resources and then become impractical. In this particular case, a balance was found by using the value 10. Validation data were used for the periodic determination of progress and also use as a criterion for stopping training [32] .

The idea behind the network architecture is the concept called \"Inception Layer\" and involves gathering information from a wider area without omitting the details. This becomes possible using the Gabor filter theory [33] with different dimensions. Gabor filters are used in order to detect complex contour detections in images. The model contains a number of 22 layers, each made up of activation and dimensional reduction functions resulting in a number of 144 components. Figure 1 shows the network architecture. Inception layers are identifiable by the 9 identical branches that occur along it. Such a fork is composed of 4 branches with three different convolution layers, in terms of filter size, and one sampling layer. Initially the network was designed to recognise 1000 categories [33] . In the present work the network was modified to identify only eight possible classes, according to the current problem. It should be pointed out that two versions of the network exist. The first is the one in which the network was trained on the data set \"ImageNet\" [15] and the version in which it was trained on the set \"Places365\" [34] which consists of 365 categories and 1.8 million images.",

The main disadvantage of this type of network is the extremely long training time required. The number of parameters is very high, so it requires significant computational effort, and the lack of random deactivation layers (Dropout) makes each neuron to be taken into account in the process of spreading the error backwards [36] . VGG19 consists of 16 convolutional layers and 3 densely connected, while VGG16 has 13 convolutional layers and as many densely connected as VGG19 [24] .",

As the suffix suggests, this is an improved version. The premise from which Chr. Szegedy started in [37] was to reduce the degree of \"strangulation\" of the network imposed by the convolutional layers. Reducing the initial size of images results in loss of information. Therefore, the proposed method to overcome this drawback is the factorisation of the convolutive layers. This technique reduces complexity and implicitly the training time, while managing to maintain the efficiency of the model. The 5 \u00d7 5-size convolution filters have been replaced by two filters of 3 \u00d7 3 dimensions. If it initially had 5 \u00d7 5 = 25 parameters, after applying factorisation it will be reduced to 3 \u00d7 3 + 3 \u00d7 3 = 18 parameters for the two filters, thus reducing by 28% the total number of variables. In addition, asymmetrical convolutional factoring is applied, a method with the same benefits. The 3 \u00d7 3-sized filters, consisting of 9 parameters, will be optimised by using two filters with dimensions 3 \u00d7 1 and 1 \u00d7 3, so the resulting number of parameters will be 3 \u00d7 1 + 1 \u00d7 3 = 6. This method offers a mitigation in the number of parameters by another 33%. The InceptionV3 contains 42 layers, requires computational effort of more than 2.5 times, but is more efficient than the VGGNet model.",

Since semantic segmentation assumes that each pixel in the image has a class associated with it [39] , the data in the \"CVC-ClinicDB\" dataset [38] is also required to comply. Initially the pixel values that make up the array, essentially the image, had values in the range [0, 255]. Taking this into account, the values were changed in order to have the set of possible values with only two elements, since the goal is to classify two types of pixels: tissue and polyps.",

By doing so, the model will learn at a faster pace at the beginning, and as the parameters approach the values needed to converge to the local minimum, the learning rate will decrease to approach the minimum as much as possible, without oscillations around the minimum. Momentum is the contribution of the previous step to the change in value at the current step. Thus, a value of 1 represents a maximum contribution, and a value of 0 a zero contribution to the current step. Validation data were also provided to assess the progress made with a cadence of 50 iterations and a condition for completing the training process through validation (validation patience) was introduced. If after five iterations the error on the validation set remains constant or increases, then the training process is suspended. The maximum number of epochs chosen is 40 and in addition, at each new epoch the data are shuffled randomly. The reason behind this choice is to eliminate the possibility that the model learns the order in which the data are served and thus over-training occurring.

Given all these impediments, augmentation methods were used for the data set, for example rotation by 90 degrees, applying the cut along the x-axis, magnification or reduction of the original image, applying the cut along the y-axis. In addition, the number of available data were relatively small, so the increase brought another benefit, namely the generation of new valid data for the training process. In this way, horizontal and vertical mirror transformations, rotations with angles between [0, 90] degrees, cuts along the X or Y axes, displacements along the axes and increases or decreases are applied. All these values were randomly generated and were in a normal distribution of zero mean with the specified lower and upper limits, respectively. Each filter had a 0.5 probability of being applied to an image. Following these operations, the model should become invariant to images that contain the regions of interest in a distorted form.

Selecting the top left button will enable data upload. A new window will appear, Figure 9 , which allows the navigation through local files and the selection of one or more images. Once the user has decided on the number and desired files, the \"Open\" button can be pressed. Uploading the data will automatically start the image classification process. It will enter in the table the predictions, the confidence score and the location of the images. When selecting a row in the table, the corresponding image will be loaded in the section intended for preview. Also below this will appear the network prediction and the safety factor on the decision, expressed as a percentage, Figure 10 . If the image selected for analysis contains polyps, then the interface will provide an additional button just below the \"Polyp Alert\" indicator, called \"Polyp Detection\", Figure 11 . Pressing this button will lead to image change. In the new image the polyp is highlighted by the yellow tint of the region. By pressing the \"Clear table\" button and confirming the action, the data will be deleted from the interface and the application will return to the beginning stage. Another possibility of use is to operate the switch on the top right, called \"Start colonoscopy\". It will automatically connect to the available camera. If the connection cannot be made, an error message will appear accompanied by the possible cause. If there are no problems in the connection, the online colonoscopy window appear, Figure 12 . At the top of the window is highlighted the network prediction on the frames, and at the bottom is available a \"Pause\" button. When pressing the \"Pause\" button, two more buttons will appear that allow the user to resume the colonoscopy or save the current image in the local storage space. In addition, if the frame contains polyps, Figure 13 , an additional button appears which locates the malignant area. If the frame on which the process was stopped contains any other class, of the seven remaining available, that button \"Locate polyp\" is not visible. When pressing the \"Continue\" button, the process will be resumed, and when select \"Save\" the image will be saved in the location where the application is installed.

This is expected, moreover it is also concluded in [6, 20, 23] , while the first layers of networks manage to learn general features for images, such as contours, areas of interest in pictures, shadows, while in depth layers focus on the particularities of each given problem. The \"Kvasir\" dataset [30] is small compared to \"ImageNet\" [15] or \"Places365\" [34] , so the trainings made with the parameters obtained on these sets offer superior performance. Table 5 shows the performances obtained after the data augmentation process. The values of the coefficients are slightly the same as those in Table 4 , a surprising fact at a first glance. In papers [9, 15, 29] , the augmentation increased the performance of the model, but in this case the effect is not obtained. The reason is that in the case of the above papers the test data were noisier, the areas of interest were not easily readable, while in the \"Kvasir\" data set [30] all the data are carefully chosen and thus the areas that are waiting to be identified are clearly visible. Table 6 highlights the model performances using both the pre-trained model and the one with randomly initialised parameters. The augmentation process of the two situations listed above is also applied. It is also noted that the increase did not improve performance, but there are notable differences between the model with the parameters resulting from the training on the \"ImageNet\" set [24] and the one in which the parameters were obtained from the training realised only on the \"Kvasir\" set [30] . The accuracy has a good percentage, but the sensitivity is slightly lower and thus the F1 score is also reduced. ",

The results of training the ResNet18 model on the \"CVC-ClinicDB\" data set [38] are presented in Table 9 . The dataset augmentation consisted of rotations around the x and y axes, decreases and enlargements by 30%, and horizontal and vertical cuts with sizes between 0 and 10 pixels. It can be noticed that the values of the Jaccard and F1 coefficients are above the recommended thresholds, so that the model manages to identify the areas of interest quite well. The increase failed to improve performance, which is expected because the data provided do not contain distorted images, but certainly during the endoscopy process, they will be able to bring their input. As endoscopy is a process that takes place in real time, using a video camera, the frames analysed every fraction of a second will be distorted and will capture the areas of interest from different angles. Then the effect of augmentation will be observed by the model's ability to identify malignant regions. However, evaluating the model on the dataset on which it was made and the network for the part of the classification of tissue types, i.e., on the database called \"Kvasir-Seg\" [45] , Table 10 , it can be concluded that performance decreases by about 10%. The reason is the difference between the image types which is specific to each data collection. The images in the \"Kvasir-Seg\" set [45] are different in terms of shapes and sizes and most importantly are not part of a contiguous sequence of data. On the other hand, the \"CVC-ClinicDB\" set [38] contains the masks of the images extracted from the video sequences, Figure 14 . Therefore the same area appears several times in a row, giving the model the opportunity to use this aspect in its favour to achieve the goal, minimising the error. To overcome these impediments, the network is also trained on the \"Kvasir-Seg\" data set [45] using the pre-trained model on \"CVC-ClinicDB\" [38] . As additional changes to the new set, it is necessary to resize the images to reach the size used for the previous set, and then the image pixels are changed, where they were transformed into values of 0 or 255 corresponding to the tags: tissue or polyp, respectively. The proportions of 60/20/20 regarding the grouping of data for training/validation/testing were kept. The results obtained for the training on the second set, \"Kvasir-Seg\" [45] , and the testing on the 20% of the group reserved for testing in the same set, are presented in Table 11 . In this case the augmentation improved the performance of the model and provided greater robustness due to the fact that the images resulting from the augmentation are more difficult to process and approach the case when frames are extracted during the endoscopy.",

Thus, we have the F1 score and the Jaccard index as performance indices. The model trained on the \"Kvasir-Seg\" set with augmentation was selected in order to be used in the application, because it obtained a Jaccard index of 75.18% and an F1 score of 54.01%. By assembling the components described above, a desktop application resulted. Its role is to facilitate the interaction between the user, the clinicians, and predictive algorithms. By using the application, the data, in the form of images, are uploaded from the local/external storage space, then they are automatically classified. The user has the possibility to analyze each image and the corresponding prediction.
