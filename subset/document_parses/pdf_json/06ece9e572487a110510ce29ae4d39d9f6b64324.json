Despite the potential benefits of integrating telehealth into routine clinical care, there are clear barriers to overcome. One of these is the perceived difficulties in remote clinical examination for surgical patients compared to other specialities. Also, one of the main barriers to applying ePROs is the clinicians' knowledge and expertise to meaningfully interpret and incorporate PROs data into their clinical practice [7] [8] [9] . Another important concern about implementation of telehealth involves the equitable access to care for all patients, particularly for elderly patients [10] . To implement the use of telehealth in thoracic surgical pathways it is important to understand the barriers and facilitators of our specific patient population: internet access, support and training of both patients and healthcare providers are mandatory for the success of the application of telehealth [11] .",

In the observational cohort, 263 patients (67%) underwent surgical metastasectomy, with survival curves demonstrating a survival advantage in the metastasectomy group that persisted up to 5 years. It is noted, however, that patients in this non-randomised group were highly selected, being younger, with better lung function, better performance status, more likely to have solitary pulmonary lesions, less likely to also have liver lesions and less likely to present with an elevated carcinoembryonic antigen compared to a control group of 128 patients with pulmonary lesions who did not undergo metastasectomy [15] . In the randomised group, 46 patients (49%) were allocated to pulmonary resection. In the resultant well-matched groups, there was no difference in survival between those who underwent surgery and those managed conservatively [14] . M. Migliore concludes that accurate preoperative staging and thoughtful patient selection is essential to maximise benefit from those offered local treatment for pulmonary metastasis. The results of PulMiCC have been a topic of much discussion and controversy since their recent publication; however, it is worth noting that poor recruitment limits the power and interpretability of the clinical results [16, 17] .",

Migliore then moved on to discuss the heterogeneity seen in this patient population, with patient, disease and treatment factors interacting to determine outcome; and to propose a recently updated concept of a dedicated staging system for pulmonary metastasis ( pmTNM) [18, 19] . This considers the complex interaction between lesion number, nodal involvement and extra-thoracic disease, and aims to present stage-grouping to help inform decision making for local treatment according to a traffic-light system. This proposes that patients with designated Stage 1 or 2 (Green) disease (up to three lesions in both lungs, or more than three lesions restricted to a single lung, but with no lymph node involvement or extra-thoracic disease) should be considered for metastasectomy, while patients at pmTNM Stage 4 (Red) (more than three lesions with a bilateral distribution, any intrathoracic lymph node involvement contralateral to unilateral pulmonary lesions, and involvement of more than one extra-thoracic site) should be excluded from local therapies. Stage 3 (Orange) represents an intermediate group where a cautious indication may exist [18, 19] . Although preliminary successful validation has been reported at the meeting on a retrospective cohort of 264 patients, this approach is being validated in a larger group of patients [20] .",

Regarding targeted treatments, there are no genomic agents with confirmed efficacy. Now a new era is starting: with regard to immunotherapy, there are recent encouraging outcomes with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) inhibitors alone or in combination with other agents as second-line treatment [31] . Tremelimumab combined with durvalumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, showed promising outcomes as either first-line or second-line treatment for MPM [32] . In addition, nivolumab combined with ipilimumab was found superior to first-line chemotherapy for unresectable MPM cases, in terms of median OS, and has now received FDA and EMA approval as first-line treatment for unresectable MPM patients [33] . Since there is no clear evidence regarding potential biomarkers, several studies are ongoing to investigate the role and prognostic value of the immune micro-environment.

To begin with, HITOC plays a crucial role as an additive https://doi.org/10.1183/23120541.00649-2021 procedure to cytoreductive surgery for the treatment of MPM. Despite the differences in protocols among different centres, along with the small study populations in the available literature, HITOC has been associated with improved outcomes compared to non-HITOC treatment in terms of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and OS, an outcome that is further confirmed by a recent meta-analysis [37, 38] . It has also been demonstrated that higher doses of HITOC were associated with better outcomes in terms of RFS and OS [39] . Nonetheless, special concern should be provided regarding the safety of the personnel and the special measures that should be taken, along with the patient's safety, by providing well-measured doses of the agents. A special challenge is to provide the appropriate dosage of cisplatin to reduce the risk of local recurrence while limiting the risk of renal insufficiency. To face all these challenges, further well-designed studies are necessary.",

The LAS is based on the predicted survival benefit (the difference between projected waitlist survival and post-transplantation survival), based on objective and transparent data from 17 items obtained in spirometry, blood gas analysis, 6-min walk test, laboratory and right heart catheterisation [40] . Analysis from the impact of the introduction of the LAS showed that waitlist mortality decreased (by eight deaths per 100 lung transplants) and patients with restrictive lung diseases are relatively favoured for transplantation, resulting in shorter waitlist times [41] .",

The use of marginal donor lungs is limited because of the fear of post-transplant lung allograft failure. Ex vivo lung perfusion (EVLP) may provide the possibility to reassess and potentially treat certain marginal donor lungs to increase donor organ utilisation rates. Currently, three EVLP protocols are used (Toronto, Lund, Organ Care System), the basic principles of which are the same: the lungs are preserved in an organ chamber and are gradually rewarmed, perfused and ventilated after which, at a temperature of 37\u00b0C, lung evaluation and treatment can be performed [43] . During evaluation, basic respiratory parameters and gross examination of structural abnormalities, as well as bronchoscopic and radiographic evaluations, are possible. Additionally, EVLP can be used as a preservation tool, extending the preservation time beyond the usual 7-12 h [44] . Finally, EVLP can be used as a therapeutic tool to perform bronchoscopic interventions, repair lung parenchyma tears, treat pulmonary oedema, etc. Several studies demonstrated comparable short-and long-term survival in EVLP-treated marginal donor lungs compared to standard transplantation [45, 46] . Research is currently performed on additional potential extensions of this technique, for example on silencing blood group antigens to allow blood group incompatible lung transplantation or silencing major histocompatibility complex expression to reduce allograft immunogenicity [47, 48] .",

The further implementation of telehealth was accelerated during the COVID-19 pandemic with excellent patient and caregiver satisfaction. An example of this is the customisable, web-based platform \"MyCare\" with personalised care plans, biometric data monitoring, clinical alerts and more [51] . Moreover, web-based telerehabilitation showed that exercise participation and progression were evident despite lack of equipment and fewer hours of training [52] . According to a pilot study by SCHENKEL et al. [53] , supplementing routine care with remote monitoring by Bluetooth devices after discharge might reduce readmission. C. Chaparro underlined that evolving technology holds promise for the future of aftercare for lung transplant recipients and will enable new platforms to communicate and interact with patients, although in-person assessments are still needed for complex issues [51] .",

This is relevant in the field of lung transplantation to differentiate between (chronic) allograft rejection, respiratory infections, drug toxicity and aspiration. Acute SAD often presents as tree-in-bud and bronchiolectasis, sometimes in combination with ground-glass opacification or consolidation. An indirect sign of SAD is mosaic attenuation and is best assessed on expiratory CT scan. Predicting bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) with CT screening is an appealing concept, but the actual application is limited owing to lack of sensitivity and specificity [54] . New developments, including objective quantitative measurements and machine learning technologies, hold more promise [53] [54] [55] . Quantitative CT metrics including lung volume and air trapping volumes correlated better with forced expiratory volume in 1 s and were better predictors than semi-quantitative scores [55] . The ratio of the airway lumen area to the cross-sectional area of the adjacent blood vessel was significantly increased in subjects who developed progressive BOS [56] . Machine learning algorithms could identify eventual BOS developers while no pulmonary function tests or clinical parameters could, and a maximal accuracy of 85% was obtained by combining baseline functional respiratory imaging features such as right middle lobe volume, right upper lobe airway resistance and central airway surface [57] .",
