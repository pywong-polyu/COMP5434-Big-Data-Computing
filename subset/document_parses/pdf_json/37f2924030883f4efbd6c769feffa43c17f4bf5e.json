Epidemiological studies have shown that \"classical\" HAstVs, which include eight distinct serotypes (HAstV- [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , are a leading cause of pediatric viral gastroenteritis worldwide and approximately 90% of children possess detectable antibodies to at least one serotype by the age of five [1] [2] [3] [4] . In addition to the \"classical\" HAstV strains, two genetically distinct \"non-classical\" HAstV clades were identified in 2009 [5, 6] , collectively known as Virginia/Human-mink-ovine (VA/HMO) viruses and are more genetically related to animal astroviruses than the classical HAstVs [7, 8] .",

While the prevalence of the non-classical VA viruses has been difficult to assess due to inadequate testing, recent seroprevalence studies suggest significant exposures to VA1 in at least 65% of adults [13, 14] . Unlike the classical HAstVs, the association of VA strains with gastroenteritis is unresolved [15, 16] . However, it is clear that VA viruses can cause systemic infections that involve the respiratory tract [17] and central nervous system (CNS) [18, 19] . To date, there have been 10 reported cases of HAstV-induced CNS infections, half of which were associated with VA1 infection [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Closely residing in the same clade as VA1, mink and ovine astroviruses have also been associated with CNS disease [27] [28] [29] potentially indicating that these particular members of the Mamastrovirus genus have distinct molecular and cellular mechanisms of disease in comparison to classical HAstV.",

Recently, our lab demonstrated that the antimicrobial drug nitazoxanide (NTZ) inhibits the replication of multiple classical HAstV by blocking double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) formation [30] . Given the recent development of VA1 strains that could replicate in cell culture [31, 32] , we asked if VA1 was similarly susceptible to NTZ. Like the classical HAstVs, VA1 replication was inhibited by NTZ treatment. We were quite surprised that NTZ could be added to VA1 infected cells for much longer times post-infection compared to HAstV-1 suggesting that VA1 replication kinetics may differ. Thus, in these studies we explored VA1 replication kinetics and impact on Caco-2 cells. Our data demonstrate that VA1 replicates more slowly than HAstV-1 and fails to disrupt cellular junctions or epithelial barrier permeability suggesting that VA1 pathogenesis is unique from the classical HAstVs.",

We previously demonstrated ERK1/2 activation occurs within 15 min post-HAstV-1 infection and is required for productive replication [36] (Figure 3A ). While the kinetics was similar (15 min compared to 30 min), the magnitude of ERK1/2 activation was decreased in VA1 infected cells ( Figure 3B ,C). Like HAstV-1, VA1 replication is dependent on ERK1/2 activation. Inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126 reduced VA1 levels by 86% compared to no drug and vehicle control alone ( Figure 3D ). None of the astroviruses described to date induce inflammation or cell death in vitro or in vivo [35, [41] [42] [43] [44] . To determine if this was also true for VA1, we measured cytokine production in HAstV-1 and VA1 infected Caco-2 cells at the peak of infection (24 and 48 hpi respectively). From a panel of 13 cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12p70, IFN-\u03b2, IL-29, IL-10 and To further examine how the prolonged replication kinetics would impact known cellular changes associated with astrovirus infection, we first examined ERK1/2 activation. We previously demonstrated ERK1/2 activation occurs within 15 min post-HAstV-1 infection and is required for productive replication [36] (Figure 3A ). While the kinetics was similar (15 min compared to 30 min), the magnitude of ERK1/2 activation was decreased in VA1 infected cells ( Figure 3B,C) . Like HAstV-1, VA1 replication is dependent on ERK1/2 activation. Inhibition of ERK1/2 with U0126 reduced VA1 levels by 86% compared to no drug and vehicle control alone ( Figure 3D ). Despite the similarities, there are differences in the cellular responses to HAstV-1 and VA1 infection. We have previously shown that classical HAstVs increase epithelial barrier permeability [41, 45] . In Caco-2 cells, this begins with the relocalization of the tight junction protein occludin from the cell periphery followed by a drop in transepithelial resistance (TER) resulting in increased barrier permeability [45] . VA1 infection had no impact on occludin relocalization even at an MOI of 10, nor did it impact TER ( Figure 5 ). Extending the time of measurement up to 72 hpi also had no impact. In contrast, Caco-2 cells infected with HAstV-1 at an MOI of 1 or 10 showed a significant drop in TER beginning between . Percent infection was measured by immunofluorescent staining for VA1 capsid at 24 hpi. Error bars indicate standard deviations from two independent experiments performed in triplicate, and asterisks show statistical significance as measured by ordinary one-way ANOVA as follows: *, p < 0.05; **, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001. None of the astroviruses described to date induce inflammation or cell death in vitro or in vivo [35, [41] [42] [43] [44] . To determine if this was also true for VA1, we measured cytokine production in HAstV-1 and VA1 infected Caco-2 cells at the peak of infection (24 and 48 hpi respectively). From a panel of 13 cytokines, TNF-\u03b1, IL-12p70, IFN-\u03b2, IL-29, IL-10 and IFN-\u03b3 were undetectable in cell supernatants and minimal levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b12, GM-CSF, IFN-\u03bb2/3 were detected ( Figure 4A-E) . IP-10 levels increased ( Figure 4F) ; however, this was not significantly different from mock infection. In fact, only the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 was significantly increased following VA1, but not HAstV-1 infection compared to mock infection ( Figure 4G ). Both HAstV and turkey astrovirus (TAstV) increased barrier permeability in vitro and in vivo [41, 45] making VA1 the first identified astrovirus strain tested that does not impact permeability. We showed that the capsid protein alone is sufficient to increase permeability and relocalize occludin. Thus, we compared VA1 and HAstV-1 ORF2 genetic similarity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. These viruses share 49.2% identity at the nucleotide level and 26.6% identity at the amino acid levels. Using publicly available protein sequences and published HAstV-1 structures, we overlaid the HAstV-1 capsid core and spike structures with that of the VA1. As predicted by the limited amino acid similarity, there were significant differences in the capsid tertiary structure ( Figure 6A,C) . While the capsid core for each virus shared 42.3% sequence identity, the spike domain only shared 11.9% identity ( Figure 6B,D) . Further studies are needed to understand how these differences impact receptor usage, viral replication kinetics and pathogenesis in vivo. To assess cell death, Caco-2 cells were infected with HAstV-1 or VA-1 and cell death measured by ATP detection assay. Neither astrovirus strain induced significant cell death ( Figure 4H) . Combined, these studies highlight that VA1, similar to other astroviruses, fails to induce cell death or inflammation during infection [35, 45] . Future studies are needed to define the role of IL-8 in VA1 pathogenesis.",

VA1 infection had no impact on occludin relocalization even at an MOI of 10, nor did it impact TER ( Figure 5 ). Extending the time of measurement up to 72 hpi also had no impact. In contrast, Caco-2 cells infected with HAstV-1 at an MOI of 1 or 10 showed a significant drop in TER beginning between 10-12 hpi ( Figure 5B,C) . Both HAstV and turkey astrovirus (TAstV) increased barrier permeability in vitro and in vivo [41, 45] making VA1 the first identified astrovirus strain tested that does not impact permeability. We showed that the capsid protein alone is sufficient to increase permeability and relocalize occludin. Thus, we compared VA1 and HAstV-1 ORF2 genetic similarity at the nucleotide and amino acid levels. These viruses share 49.2% identity at the nucleotide level and 26.6% identity at the amino acid levels. Using publicly available protein sequences and published HAstV-1 structures, we overlaid the HAstV-1 capsid core and spike structures with that of the VA1. As predicted by the limited amino acid similarity, there were significant differences in the capsid tertiary structure ( Figure 6A,C) . While the capsid core for each virus shared 42.3% sequence identity, the spike domain only shared 11.9% identity ( Figure 6B,D) . Further studies are needed to understand how these differences impact receptor usage, viral replication kinetics and pathogenesis in vivo. Figure 6 . Alignment of classical HAstV-1 capsid structures with VA1 homology models. Crystal structure of the HAstV-1 (blue and green) aligned with homology models of VA1 capsid core (A) and spike (C). VA1 models (B,D) were marked with different colors based on its similarity with HAstV-1 reference: residues that are perfectly conserved (red), residues that are not perfectly conserved but that have a BLOSUM62 score higher than 0 (pink) and residues with a BLOSUM62 score lower than 0 or residues that are aligned to a gap in the reference (white).",

The contrast in the levels of IL-8 induction seen in our studies and in previous reports may be due to differences in MOI used or the dynamic range of detection between detection assays. These findings highlight that VA1 may drive a different cellular response depending on the cell tropism. IL-8 is an important inflammatory marker in the gut [43] . We know that inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-\u03b1, are associated with increased barrier permeability [48] . However, there are no reports on the role of IL-8 in intestinal barrier permeability.
