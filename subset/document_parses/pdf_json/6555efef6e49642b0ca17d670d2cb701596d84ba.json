In Brazil, the SARS-CoV-2 lineages B.1.1.28 and B.1.1.33 dominated the first epidemic wave [1, 2] , but were replaced by the VOC P.1 and the VOI P.2, both descendants of lineage B.1.1.28 by the end of 2020 and beginning of 2021 (http://www.genomahcov.fiocruz.br/). The VOC P.1, which harbors the mutations of concern S:K417T/E484K/N501Y among its lineage defining mutations, was first detected in January 2021 [3] . Once originated in Manaus, capital of the Amazonas state in mid-November, rapidly spread across Brazil [4, 5] and to over 50 countries globally (https://cov-lineages.org/lineage_description_list.html). The VOI P.2, carrying the concerning S:E484K amino acid change, was initially detected in samples from the Rio de Janeiro (RJ) state in October 2020 and spread throughout the country and abroad since then (https://cov-lineages.org/lineage_description_list.html) [6] [7] [8] .",

To test this hypothesis, we conducted an epidemiological and genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 complete genomes from 84 patients. All patients were diagnosed between November 2020 and February 2021 in Rocha, a sentinel Eastern Uruguayan department bordering with RS, Brazil, which nearly replicates the epidemiological curve of the whole country (see P7/P14 calculations in https://guiad-covid.github.io/estadisticasuy.html).

Lineage B.1.1.28 was the most prevalent in the period November-December, 2020 while P.2 became the dominant one during January-February, 2021, thus supporting a similar lineage replacement process as observed in several Brazilian states including RS, the southernmost Brazilian state (Fig 2A) . As it is highlighted in Fig 2A, there is an empirically observed time lag of about three months between P.2 reported in RS and Rocha, which likely depends not only on the variant's dissemination dynamic but also on the different sequencing efforts. Given the change in the dominant viral variant and to assess whether introduction of the VOI P.2 could have an impact on patients' viral loads, we compared 761 Ct values within two periods, prior and after first detection of the VOI (Fig S1) . We found a statistically significant decrease in Ct values in the after-P.2 period respect to the before-P.2 period ( Fig S1B, left panel, p-value <0.0035) and this effect remains when comparison was restricted to phases with equivalent epidemiological scenarios (exponential growth phase, p-value<0.0022) as suggested in [38] (Fig S1B, right panel) .",

By comparing lineage prevalence in the Southernmost Brazilian state of RS and Rocha, we observed a similar molecular epidemiological pattern between both locations with a temporal delay (e.g., three months for P.2 and one month for P.1). The VOI P.2 was first detected in RS in October 2020 at low prevalence (14%) and became the most frequent variant in December 2020 (53%). In January, 2021, the introduction of P.1 was established and it rapidly dominated over other variants in RS from February (66%) onwards. In Rocha, we identified a first period with dominance of lineage B.1.1.28 in November-December, 2020 All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

In the UdelaR laboratory located in Rocha (CURE Regional Este-Rocha, Uruguay) which is part of the UdelaR Labs Network for SARS-CoV-2 molecular detection, the viral RNA extraction was performed directly from samples (virus transport media containing the swab collected) by using the Viral RNA Isolation Kit (Liferiver Bio-Tech Corp., San Diego, USA), according to the manufacturer's instructions. The viral RNA extracted was used as a template in a OneStep RT-qPCR kit COVID-19 RT-PCR Real TM Fast (UdelaR, IPMON and ATGen S.R.L., Montevideo, Uruguay) to test the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the samples, according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Given the unlikely existence of a direct link between southeastern Brazil and Rocha, a prior dissemination of this sub-lineage in other parts of Uruguay before being introduced in Rocha seems like a reasonable assumption. Indeed, this might have contributed to the emergence of the Uruguayan first COVID-19 wave by the end of 2020. By January, 2021, we confirmed the circulation of VOI P.2 in Rocha. This variant harbors the E484K amino acid change in the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the viral Spike among its five lineage-defining mutations [6].
