Survival analysis, logistic regression, and machine learning techniques (both supervised and unsupervised) are applied to carry out the analysis where the endpoint variable is the reason for hospital discharge (home or deceased). The different methods applied show the importance of variables such as age, O 2 saturation at Emergency Rooms (ER), and whether the patient comes from a nursing home. In addition, biclustering is used to globally analyze the patient-drug dataset, extracting segments of patients. We highlight the validity of the classifiers developed to predict the mortality, reaching an appreciable accuracy. Finally, interpretable decision rules for estimating the risk of mortality of patients can be obtained from the decision tree, which can be crucial in the prioritization of medical care and resources.",

A search, on the same date, on clinicaltrials.gov for studies targeting the COVID condition showed more than 3100 registered studies [2, 3] .

In [35] , several hypothesis contrasts and the chi-squared and Wilcoxon tests were performed using this dataset. However, model-based statistical techniques and machine learning techniques were uncovered. In this paper, we analyze the dataset using other statistical models (logistic regression and survival analysis), as well as supervised (decision trees, random forest, and Bayesian networks) and unsupervised (biclustering) machine learning techniques [36] [37] [38] . Therefore, a relevant contribution of this manuscript is the use of methods that allow direct extraction of clinical knowledge from these models.",

Finally, the validity of the classifiers developed to predict mortality is checked where the outcome variable is hospital discharge (the patients were reported as home or deceased), with the best model reaching a value of 0.89 in AUC for the test set (the worst model reaching a value of 0.77). Interpretable decision rules for estimating the risk of mortality of the patient can be obtained from the decision trees, which can be crucial in the prioritization of medical care and resources.

Furthermore, corticosteroids have also been used in a significant proportion. Oseltamivir has also been used in this bicluster, which is an antiretroviral commonly used for Influenzavirus A. Interestingly, there is a higher % of ondansetron in this bicluster, which is an antiemetic drug for nausea caused by chemotherapy, and therefore, it could be that the mortality rate was due to the high proportion of oncology patients in this bicluster. In fact, one of the significant variables in logistic regression was oncological patient deterioration. To conclude, the high proportion of anesthetic, analgesic, and sedative drugs in the last bicluster in comparison with the others is striking, which is why it could be called \"the palliative bicluster\". have also been used in a significant proportion. Oseltamivir has also been used in this bicluster, 310 which is an antiretroviral commonly used for Influenzavirus A. Interestingly, there is a higher % 311 of Ondasentron in this Bicluster, which is an antiemetic drug for nausea caused by chemotherapy 312 and therefore it could be that the mortality rate was due to high proportion of oncology patients in The above results were obtained by analyzing only the patient-drug dataset. We now use the first dataset analyzed in this paper (with variables such as age, discharge destination, etc.), and we calculate the statistics of these variables in each of the biclusters. Table 7 shows these statistics, and we can see a surprising result: the patients belonging to each bicluster show very different statistics from the others in terms of age, O 2 saturation, % ICU, and % deceased. Note that these variables have not been used to obtain the biclusters. In Table 7 , we observe that patients in Bicluster 1 were younger (62 \u00b1 15 years), presented a higher O 2 saturation in the ER (94 \u00b1 4), and only 0.7% of them entered the ICU. The percentage of exitus in this bicluster is only 1.5%. Biclusters 2, 3, and 4 show increasing probabilities of entering the ICU, increasing probabilities of exitus, and increasing average ages. On the other hand, the mean O 2 saturation decreases across these biclusters. We conclude that it can be clearly seen that each bicluster contains patients at different stages of the disease, from least to greatest severity. ",

These types of rules can be very useful in the ER to easily and quickly estimate a patient's risk of dying. It is interesting that the variable RESIDENTI AL_I NSTITUTION is associated with the segment with a higher risk of dying (71.4 % in testing).

Given the absence of controlled clinical studies, it has been a time of change and adaptation. What seemed like a good option yesterday the next day has changed. For example, lopinavir/ritonavir began to be used, but in a news release on 4 July 2020 [54], WHO accepted the recommendation from the Solidarity Trial's International Steering Committee to discontinue the trial's lopinavir/ritonavir arm because it was producing little or no reduction in the mortality of hospitalized COVID-19 patients when compared to standard care. Furthermore, hydroxychloroquine treatment, an experimental antimalarial drug against COVID, was also used, and initially, its trials appeared to be encouraging; however, recently, on 1 July 2020, the FDA warned [56] of the risk of heart rhythm problems.",

There is a generalized collapse of health systems, and projects such as COVID DATA SAVE LIVES are essential for artificial intelligence to provide healthcare staff with tools to speed up decision-making. This article attempts to bring knowledge to this disease. However, a study of these characteristics presents several problems: (a) the data do not come from a controlled study; (b) they have been collected in complex health situations; and (c) they are from a specific population that goes to these hospital centers. In spite of this, the usefulness of advanced data analysis was shown in order to extract knowledge. This paper confirms that the elderly have a very high risk of dying from COVID-19. Supervised machine learning models show other variables that are important for predicting the evolution of the disease such as O 2 saturation, ER department, and ER simplified diagnostic. Simple and interpretable decision rules for estimating the risk of mortality of the patient can be obtained from the decision trees, which can be crucial in the prioritization of medical care and resources.",

These two sets are mutually exclusive. Training 191 set was used for constructing the models while test set was used for estimating their generalization 192 capability. Additionally, in the Logistic regression model the variables were standarized according 193 to their training set statistics. Once a model was constructed, its optimal classification threshold was computed as the threshold corresponding to the ROC point in training closest to the (FPR=0, TPR=1) point.In order to evaluate the reliability of the supervised learning models, a 10-fold resampling technique was applied in the training set. This allows to estimate a confidence interval for the 198 performance of each model.
