Reports of Long COVID are rising but little is known about prevalence in non-hospitalized patients. Objective: We sought to identify the persistent symptoms of COVID-19 in frontline workers at Right to Care (RTC) South Africa who have past the acute phase of illness with a view to establishing rehabilitation programs for its employees and the community at large. Methods: This was a cross-sectional survey. We analysed data from 207 eligible COVID-19 positive RTC frontline workers who participated in a post-COVID online self-administered survey. The survey was active for two months. Frequencies and median were calculated for categorical and continuous variables, respectively. Results: The survey response rate was 30% (62 out of 207); of the 62 respondents with a median age of 33.5 years (IQR= 30-44 years), 47 (76%) were females. The majority (n=55; 88.7%) selfisolated and 7 (11.3%) were admitted to hospital at time of diagnosis. The most common comorbid condition reported was hypertension particularly among workers aged 45-55 years. Headache, body ache, fatigue, loss of smell, dry cough, fever, and loss of appetite were the most common reported symptoms at time of diagnosis. Persistent symptoms were characterized by fatigue, anxiety, difficulty sleeping, chest pain, muscle pain and brain fog, being the six most reported. Conclusion: The impact of persistent/Long COVID-19 on the health of frontline workers could have direct impact in health service delivery. Given the rise in cases of COVID-19 in South Africa and the world at large, the prevalence of Long COVID is likely to be substantial and therefore need for rehabilitation programs targeted at each of the persistent (Long) COVID symptoms is critical.",

[3] In a study by Huang et al. [4] , more than 75% of patients that were previously hospitalized with COVID-19 had at least one lingering symptom six months later. Some suggested residual effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection reported so far include but not limited to fatigue, shortness of breath, joint pain, chest pain, cognitive disturbances, and drop in the quality of life.

Participants were asked to rate how bothersome the post COVID-19 symptoms were, using a 10point end labelled adopted response scale was (least bothersome to most bothersome). Similarly, for the severity of current post COVID-19 symptoms, a 10-point end labelled slider scale was adopted for the response scale (not noticeable to unbearable). An eight-point Likert scale was adopted for the response scale about number of days spent on exercise prior to COVID-19 diagnosis (None to Seven), whereas a nine-point Likert scale was adopted for the response scale on the time (in minutes) spent on exercise (10 to greater than 150) in line with WHO recommended activity levels of 150 minutes moderate intensity exercise per week.

Firstly, the small sample of positives for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostic test result does not provide enough statistical power to determine risk factors for Long COVID. However, the survey was able to answer the main survey question. Our study has shown the impact on physical and mental health that COVID-19 has among infected individuals even in the absence of active SARS-CoV-2 virus. Our population was mostly health workers who are in the frontline dealing with the pandemic above other existing infections such as TB and HIV. As such, the impact of COVID even among those that are beyond the active phase of infection could have direct impact in health service delivery. Given the rise in cases of COVID-19 in South Africa and the world at large, the prevalence of Long COVID is likely to be substantial and therefore need for rehabilitation programs targeted at each of the persistent (Long) COVID symptoms is critical. It highlights the importance of slowing the spread of COVID-19 through validated public health measures and vaccinations and continued research into Long COVID to find rehabilitation/treatment options. While our study numbers were small, future work should include detailed physical and mental examination to guide patient management.",
