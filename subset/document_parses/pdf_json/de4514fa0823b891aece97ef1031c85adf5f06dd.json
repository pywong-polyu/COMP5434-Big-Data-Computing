Self-report compliance was assessed with six behaviours: mask wearing, hand washing, indoor household mixing, outdoor household mixing, social distancing, and compliance with other guidelines. Patterns of compliance behaviour were identified using latent class analysis, and multinomial logistic regression was used to assess demographic, socioeconomic and personality predictors of behaviour patterns. Results: We selected a four latent class solution. Most individuals reported similar levels of compliance across the six behaviour measures. High levels of compliance was the modal response. Lower self-reported compliance was related to young age, high risk-taking behaviour, low confidence in government, and low empathy, among other factors. Looking at individual behaviours, mask wearing had the highest level of compliance whilst compliance with social distancing was relatively low. Conclusion: Results suggest that individuals choose to comply with all guidelines, rather than some but not others.",

For instance, a recent German study identified a small group of individuals intending to comply only with behaviours performed in public, such as social distancing and avoiding mass events (Tomczyk et al., 2020) . However, existing studies are typically based on small samples, use data from early in the COVID-19 pandemic (which is limiting as predictors differ through time; van der Weerd et al., 2011; Wright & Fancourt, 2020) , or have looked at compliance intentions, rather than performed behaviours. Therefore, in this study we explored patterns on self-reported compliance with six COVID-19 preventive behaviours, using data from a sample of 20,000 UK adults eight months after lockdown was first implemented in the UK. We further tested whether behavioural patterns were related to a wide-range of demographic, socio-economic and personality trait characteristics.",

The study is not random and therefore is not representative of the UK population, but it does contain a heterogeneous sample. The sample was recruited using three primary approaches. First, convenience sampling was used, including promoting the study through existing networks and mailing lists (including large databases of adults who had previously consented to be involved in health research across the UK), print and digital media coverage, and social media. Second, more targeted recruitment was undertaken focusing on (i) individuals from a low-income background, (ii) individuals with no or few educational qualifications, and (iii) individuals who were unemployed. Third, the study was promoted via partnerships with third sector organisations to vulnerable groups, including adults with pre-existing mental health conditions, older adults, carers, and people experiencing domestic violence or abuse. The study was approved by the UCL Research Ethics Committee [12467/005] and all participants gave informed consent. The study protocol and user guide (which includes full details on recruitment, retention, data cleaning, weighting and sample demographics) are available at https://github.com/UCL-BSH/CSSUserGuide. A module on compliance behaviours was included in the survey between 17 November and 23 December 2020.

A small minority of individuals reported low compliance levels on household mixing but not other measures, though this may be explained by inattentive responses. Behaviour patterns and compliance with individual behaviours were each related to individual characteristics. Most notably, there was evidence that high compliance was strongly related to older age and to lower risk-taking behaviour, consistent with previous research using the COVID-19 Social Study (Wright & Fancourt, 2020) . Both of these represent motivations for compliance, and are consistent with a previous study applying the COM-B model to COVID-19 hygiene practices that identified motivation as the most important predictor of compliance behaviour (Miller et al., 2020) . However, it should be noted that large differences have been observed between longitudinal and cross-sectional associations with individual characteristics and compliance (Wright et al., Accepted) .",

Compliance with mask wearing was particularly high, frequently being carried out even among the low compliance group. This may reflect that mask wearing is legally mandated, involves little personal sacrifice, is easily observed by others (there is evidence .

Further, though the pandemic is a salient event, the opportunities for non-compliance are many. Individuals may not recall compliance accurately. Guidelines also changed over the study period, which may have influenced responses. Last, we used data from a non-representative (albeit heterogeneous and weighted) sample with substantial attrition rates.
