The lockdown measure is the most controversial one as it imposes an overwhelming impact on our economy and society. Especially when and how to enforce the lockdown measures are the most challenging questions considering both economic and epidemiological costs. In this paper, we extend the classic SIR model to find optimal decision making to balance between economy and people's health during the outbreak of COVID-19. In our model, we intend to solve a two phases optimisation problem: policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximise the overall welfare of the society; people in different health statuses take different decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximise their utility. We develop a novel method to estimate parameters for the model through various additional sources of data. We use the Cournot equilibrium to model people's behaviour and also consider the cost of death in order to leverage between economic and epidemic costs. The analysis of simulation results provides scientific suggestions for policymakers to make critical decisions on when to start the lockdown and how strong it should be during the whole period of the outbreak. Although the model is originally proposed for the COVID-19 pandemic, it can be generalised to address similar problems to control the outbreak of other infectious diseases with the lockdown measures.",

Numerous prevention measures have been studied by [11] and [24] in order to control the spread of the virus by the governments. For example, medical measures, such as research on testing, medicine, and vaccine, are accelerated; relatively easy measures, like face masking and social distancing, are also widely accepted and applied. Essentially the most effective prevention of COVID-19 is the lockdown measure which completely ceases the movement of the human being and thus slows down the spread of disease. However, the lockdown measure is incredibly controversial as it imposes a tremendous impact on our society and economy. Hence it might be the most difficult decision to be made by the governments. Especially when and how to impose the lockdown measure is one of the most challenging questions for both politicians and scientists. To address this question, there is a need to develop a mathematical model combining both epidemiology and economics.",

However, there is less discussion on how the lockdown policies can influence the economic decisions of people and the spread of disease and how can policymakers make optimal policy in the epidemic. [10] and [9] analyse the government intervention using epidemiological models with exogenous parameters and evaluate the effect of the intervention by simulation results. Some recent papers focus on analysis of optimal policy and policy effect in the framework of the SIR model or its variants. They studied the effect of different measures including fiscal policy ( [7] , [6] , [15] ), testing and quarantine ( [23] , [4] , [18] , [2] ), intervention policy on multi-aged groups ( [5] , [1] , [12] ), social distancing ( [19] , [8] , [14] ) and lockdown control ( [3] , [13] , [1] ). In previous works, [3] studied the optimal lockdown policy that minimises the value of fatalities and the output costs of the lockdown policy by locking down part of the susceptible and Infectious population, [1] researched the optimal lockdown policies on people of different age groups, and [13] maximise the economic activity level with the burden of the health-care system.",

Different from [7] that studied the optimal containment policy by controlling the tax rate, we control the level of lockdown, which is more direct and effective for the governments, especially in the early stage of the pandemic. Furthermore, we emphases the cost of death in our model objective of policymakers, which is an important factor in real-world government decision making. Using this method, we can enable the lockdown policy to identify a balance between the impact of the epidemics on the economy and people's health.",

The reason that the optimal lockdown control policy did not cause a severe recession might be that in the no control case, susceptible people will cut back their working hours, as well as their consumption as the infected population increases, and in the optimal lockdown control restricted the infected population so that susceptible people won't cut back their consumption as much. We proved in section 2 that the recovered and Infectious people will work as much time as possible in order to maximize their own utility, but the behaviour of susceptible people is not certain. In the parameter setting of our experiments, the susceptible people almost work as much as possible just as the infected and recovered people do, but slightly reduce their working hours from the upper bound of lockdown constrain near the end of the time horizon, this behaviour may due to the increase of infected proportion, which raises the risk of getting infected for susceptible people.",

As the penalty coefficient increases, the optimal policy becomes constantly more strict. The relation of the death penalty coefficient and the result optimal control rate is below linear.

In this subsection, we consider the smart containment, by which means the policymaker directly chooses working hours for all three kinds of people with the same objective function as previous models. There is no need to apply any lockdown on recovered people because their utility reaches the maximum as their working hour is at the maximum and they do not affect the utility or the transition of susceptible and Infectious people. Our results show that in the smart lockdown control policy, Infectious people almost do not work at the beginning, but then the planner gradually increases their working hours as the infected population decreases rapidly, and susceptible people work almost without fear of becoming infected. Figure 5 (page 25) shows that compare to the previous optimal lockdown control policy, the smart lockdown policy is much better, since it reduces the number of deaths to a great extent, and almost avoids the recession because the proportion of Infectious people is extremely small. The implement of a smart lockdown control policy requires the planners to know the status of all people and have control over their working hours. In reality, the knowledge of people's status needs measures such as medical testing and rely on the accuracy of testing. Our results suggest that these measures and information that are helpful for taking smart lockdown policy are beneficial for social welfare.",

We present the R 0 of lockdown polices in all our experiments in Figure 6 (page 26). The R 0 of smart lockdown policy is much smaller than that of all other lockdown policies. The R 0 of lockdown policies with the same lockdown rate for all three kinds of people behave similarly to their lockdown rate whereas in the no control case, its R 0 decreases constantly and the R 0 of smart lockdown policy behaves similar to the lockdown rate of Infectious people. This is because the behaviour of all three kinds of people is in accordance with the lockdown rate in optimal lockdown control policies, while the behaviour of susceptible people varies if there is no control, and in the smart lockdown case, the susceptible and recovered people almost remain the lockdown rate as constant 1 in the whole control process, thus its R 0 behaves in accordance with the lockdown rate of Infectious people. Notice that although the R 0 of in the no control case decreases below 1, and the R 0 of lockdown control policies with or without the death penalty increase over 1, policies with lockdown control are much better than that without control as analyzed in previous subsections. We, therefore, suggest that whether R 0 is larger or less than 1 can not be the only foundation for planners to make judgements or decisions on the current situation.",

In our model, people in different health statuses take different decisions on their working hours and consumption to maximise their own utility, while policymakers control the lockdown rate to maximise the overall welfare, which leads to a two phases optimisation problem. Several parameters in our model are not straightforward to specify using the common epidemic data for modelling. We develop a novel method of parameter estimation through various additional sources of data. Our results show that lockdown measures could effectively reduce the deaths and infections caused by the COVID-19. There is an inevitable trade-off between the short-term recession, and health problems caused by the pandemic, and how policymakers deal with this could lead to very different decisions. We quantify the tradeoff by emphasising the cost of death in the model objective, which enables the optimal lockdown policy to discover a balance between the economic and epidemic outcomes. The timing of starting and ending the lockdown control policy makes much difference in terms of both the economic and epidemic outcomes. So the earlier to start the control, the better the results will be. It is crucial to avoid premature ending of the control. In the analysis of the smart containment policy, the results suggest that additional information about the health status of people is beneficial, as the optimal lockdown control policy will reach much better outcomes if it could be implemented on people with different health status separately. Through comparison of lockdown policies, we suggest that R 0 cannot be the only foundation for policy-making. ",
