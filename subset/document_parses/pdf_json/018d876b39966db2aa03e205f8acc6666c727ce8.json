We define these categories for n age and sex groups in m different spatial locations. Therefore, the resulting model contains all epidemiological classes for each age group, sex, and location. The mixing between them is accomplished by means of time-dependent infection rate matrices. The model is calibrated with the curve of daily new infections in New York City and its boroughs, including census data, and the proportions of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths for each age range. We finally obtain a model that matches the reported curves and predicts accurate infection information for different locations and age classes.",

A number of approaches have been proposed, and a review on this subject can be found in 20 .

All these results show that disease spread was contained after 19-Mar-2020. However, as we shall see later on, new infection waves can occur if containment measures are relaxed. Figure 2 shows the adherence of the calibrated model predictions to the 7-day moving average of the reported number of new infections.

We consider two different scenarios. In the first scenario, the transmission parameters stay at the level of strict containment, as was observed in the period from 04 to 14-June-2020. Thus, for any date t after 14-June-2020, the transmission coefficient \u03b2(t) is set as the mean for the estimated values of \u03b2(t) in the period from 04 to 14-June-2020, i.e., \u03b2(t) = 1.77 with 90% CI 0.27-4.69. In the second case, we simulate a controlled reopening by allowing the coefficient \u03b2(t) to reach twice the values obtained in the previous case, i.e., \u03b2(t) = 3.54 (0.53-9.38). However, if we impose the condition that whenever the number of daily new infections reaches 1000 cases, containment measures are undertaken, forcing \u03b2(t) to return to lower levels until it reaches the value 1.77 (0. 27-4.69 ). On the other hand, after undertaking containment measures, if the number of daily new infections is below 200 cases, we permit reopening, and \u03b2(t) may increase again until it reaches 3.54 (0.53-9.38). Figure 5 (left and center panels) present the curves of daily new infections for the aforementioned scenarios. Before 14-June-2020, we have the estimated curves. The forecasting is carried out from 15-June-2020 to 11-May-2021. According to this example, the reopening without an effective vaccine or the achievement of herd immunity may give rise to new infection waves, even when the number of daily new cases is relatively low. To simulate a controlled reopening of schools from 15-June-2020, we use the set of parameters estimated after 19-Mar-2020. To artificially increase the interaction between school-age individuals, the entries of the transmission matrix \u03b2 M associated with the mildly infective individuals in the age range 0 to 17 years old are multiplied by 2.5. In addition, the time-dependent transmission coefficient is set to 1.25 times the mean of the estimated values for the period 06 to 15-June-2020. For this specific age range, the transmission parameter values are similar to those obtained for the period before 19-Mar-2020. This result is expected since controlling the mixing in youth population at schools is difficult. Indeed, recent news indicates that the COVID-19 transmission rate among people under 19 years old is similar to that in other age ranges 38, 39 . Reopening Staten island. Two different scenarios are considered in this example: reopening Staten Island with and without restrictive measures. In the first scenario, containment measures are slightly relaxed, without allowing people from different age ranges and boroughs to interact. Quantitatively, we keep the same parameter values estimated in the period 19-Mar-2020 onwards. The only change is in the transmission coefficient for Staten Island, which is set to twice the mean of the corresponding estimated values of \u03b2(t) for the period 22-June-2020 to 01-July-2020, for dates t after 01-July-2020. During the forecasted period (02-Jul-2020 to 29-Oct-2020), the transmission coefficients for the other boroughs are kept equal to the mean of the estimated values for the period 22-June-2020 to 01-July-2020.",

In addition, we allow the time-dependent transmission coefficient for Staten Island to reach twice the mean of the estimated values for the period 22-June-2020 to 01-July-2020, for dates t after 01-July-2020. Again, after 01-July-2020, the transmission coefficients for the other boroughs are kept equal to the mean of the estimated values for the period 22-June-2020 to 01-July-2020. Whenever the number of daily new infections reaches 1000 in NYC, containment measures are undertaken again. Therefore, the time-independent transmission parameters are brought back to the same values of the period after 19-Mar-2020, and the transmission coefficient for Staten Island is reset to the mean of the corresponding estimated values for the period 22-June-2020 to 01-July-2020. Reopening reoccurs whenever the number of daily new infections in NYC is below 100 reports. Figures 6 and 7 present the curves of daily new infections for the first and second scenarios, respectively. They show the evolution for each borough and for the entire NYC. In the first case, doubling the mean of the transmission coefficient alone is not sufficient to cause secondary waves of infection. In other words, if restriction of movement between boroughs is maintained and the interaction between age ranges remains contained through strict social distancing measures, infection will not return and the disease outbreak will die out. On the other hand, reopening a borough and allowing people of different ages and from different boroughs to interact, even while keeping some light containment and social distancing measures, can cause new waves of infection for large periods.",

After calibration, the model predictions were adherent to the data of daily new infections and accurately predicted the number of daily new hospitalizations and deaths. The adjustment of the rates of hospitalization and death using appropriate ratios of reported data contributed to improving model predictions. While backtesting, forecasts for few days ahead under different contexts were found to be accurate. The model accurately identified the effects of the lockdown undertaken in NYC after 12-Mar-2020. A considerable change in the values of the transmission rates was observed. This change flattened the curve and kept the number of daily new infections low, as shown in 27 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The rates of hospitalizations and deaths were lower by the end of August than in earlier periods of the COVID-19 outbreak in NYC. This phenomenon may be caused by the changes in disease virulence or in the protocols used to address COVID-19, such as smaller onset to hospitalization mean time, more precise COVID-19 diagnosis, or the introduction of more effective treatments 41 . Moreover, in NYC, the number of COVID-19 daily tests has been increasing consistently since the beginning of the outbreak in the end of February 2020. To account for such changes in the aforementioned rates, the corresponding model parameters were adjusted using the ratios of reported data, incorporating this feature. This considerably increased the accuracy of the model predictions of hospitalizations and deaths, as shown by the results (Fig. 2 and Table 1) .",

By 22-Aug-2020, schools and shopping malls were still closed, yet public transportation and a number of economic activities were already operational 42, 43 . Strict social distancing measures were still enforced, and public authorities were closely following their observance. This approach kept the number of daily new infections stable. Figure 2 shows the COVID-19 situation in NYC until 21-Aug-2020. The panel presents the comparison of model predictions and reports of daily new infections, as well as the time-dependent basic reproduction rate R(t). We observe that since 19-Mar-2020, R(t) stays near one, meaning that disease transmission is under control, but not eradicated, and that new infection waves may still occur. Even after reaching the fourth phase of controlled reopening, NYC authorities managed to keep transmission under control through social distancing measures by limiting the operational capacity of numerous services, disinfecting public transportation, and many other practices.",

Note that whenever the number of daily new infections reaches 1000 cases, containment measures are imposed again. Reopening occurs if the number of daily new cases falls below 200. Therefore, even in an idealized situation, reopening schools may cause new infection waves among the entire population. Thus, monitoring transmission dynamics is of fundamental importance to set the appropriate time for relaxing or tightening containment measures. In Israel, the recent reopening of schools caused a secondary wave of new infections that forced the adoption of new containment measures 39 .",
