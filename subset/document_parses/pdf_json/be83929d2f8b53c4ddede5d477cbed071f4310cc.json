The anti-SARS-CoV-2 post-vaccination antibody response against the spike protein was assessed using the ARCHITECT immunoglobulin G (IgG) II Quant test (Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, USA), with titres of >50 arbitrary units per milliliter (AU/mL) being considered as positive.

Among the 59 HDPs Our results confirm the low rate of immunization in KTRs after two doses of mRNA vaccine, as recently reported by others. Boyarsky et al. [3] reported a rate of immunization of 54% in 658 solid organ recipients. The immune response is largely influenced by immunosuppression regimen and is particularly low with the usual association of tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil [3] and with belatacept [5] . However, the occurrence of severe infections after vaccination in KTR, reported in our study and by others [6] is worrying. Our results also confirm [4] the high degree of seroconversion in HDPs, although with lower titres of antibodies compared with the general population. A strong correlation between neutralizing antibody levels and protection from symptomatic COVID-19 after vaccination is now reported [7] . We report for the first time, reassuring data for HDPs in a medical satellite facility. These patients are younger and have fewer comorbidities than in-centre HDPs.",
