            "text": "Cold spray has recently emerged as a promising new technology for various coating, additive manufacturing, and on-site repair needs. One key challenge underlying cold spray is the proper simulation of the deposition process, for which numerous numerical studies have been carried out, but often fail to consider the interfacial adhesion. In this study, a new numerical approach on the base of peridynamics (PD) was developed to incorporate interfacial interactions as a part of the constitutive model to capture deformation, bonding, and rebound of impacting particles in one unified framework. Two models were proposed to characterize the adhesive contacts, i.e., a longrange Lenard-Johns type potential and a force-stretch relation of the interface directly derived from fracture properties of the bulk material. Using copper as the sample material, the deformation behaviors simulated by the PDbased approach were found to compare well with those from benchmark finite element method simulations. It was further demonstrated that this PD-based approach allows flexibility to realize different deposition scenarios, such as particle-substrate bonding and separation, by modulating adhesion energies. The approach provides a new numerical framework for more realistic cold spray impact simulations.",

            "text": "Cold Gas Dynamic Spray (CGDS), also known as cold spray, in which particles with high kinetic energy impact and adhere to the substrate, was first introduced in the mid-1980s by scientists from the Russian Academy of Sciences ( Ref 1) . In this process, fine powders (normally 1-80 microns) are accelerated by high pressure gas, typically nitrogen or helium, to a high velocity (in the range of 400-1200 m/s) and hit the substrate at a relatively low temperature (between 373 and 873 K). Its low temperature operation provides several potential benefits such as keeping original particle microstructure, providing good deposition efficiency and high bond strength, as well as avoiding particle/substrate oxidations ( . It has also been shown that with suitable conditions, CGDS can achieve good deposition rate and dense coatings ( Ref 5) . With the benefits it promises, the CGDS process has attracted good attention for applications in electronics, composites, nanostructured coatings, and recently in antimicrobial coatings for Sars-CoV-2 (COVID-19) inactivation (Ref [6] [7] [8] . With the growth of additive manufacturing (AM), such attention has further intensified because of the CGDS' AM abilities. It also brings possible solutions to challenges in typical AM approaches. For instance, the residual stress in additively manufactured layers using common AM techniques is generally high due to cooling from elevated temperature, but is much lower in layers This article is an invited paper selected from presentations at the 2021 International Thermal Spray Conference, ITSC2021, that was held virtually May 25-28, 2021 produced by cold spray (Ref 9) . It is widely accepted that cold spray is a solid-state coating process, during) which the bonding is formed due to plastic deformation rather than heat. To date, numerous studies have been carried out to investigate the cold spray process and several bonding mechanisms were proposed, including adiabatic shear instability at the interface during deposition (Ref 2, 10, 11), development of interfacial instability which induces physical anchoring effect Ref 12, 13) , and fracture and removal of the surface oxide layer due to high-velocity impact and subsequent metal jet formation ( Ref 14, 15) . Nonetheless, there remains contention on the exact bonding mechanism during cold spray ( Ref 3, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .",

Only the deformed particles post bonding can be observed by microscopy. As a result, numerical simulations have been employed as alternatives to investigate the bonding mechanism during cold spray ( Ref 2, 10, 11, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Modeling cold spray deposition is a challenging problem as in a full scale it would involve modeling of multiple particle contacts, bonding and debonding with plastic deformation of individual particles. The traditional finite element method (FEM) has been successfully applied in simulating the high-velocity impact problems. However, due to the high computational cost and complicated modeling to obtain accurate results, much research has focused on a single spherical particle impact model ( Ref 2, 3, 20, 23, 28, 29) . Few FEM studies focused on the impact of multiple particles (Ref [30] [31] [32] [33] , but the number of particles was limited so that only the first a few layers of deposited particles could be simulated.",

The elements can get severely distorted leading to degradation in numerical accuracy (Ref [34] [35] [36] . Furthermore, in many classical FEM studies the proper modeling of bonding or de-bonding of cold spray particles was not considered. The typical treatment is that the particle will either bounce off or be enforced bonded after impacting the substrate. This contradicts the reality where only particles fulfilling certain velocity/deformation conditions would bounce off or be bonded to the surface. Recently, Rahmati and Jodoin (Ref 35) proposed a numerical method based on Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) to model the metallurgical bonds forming in cold spray. Later, Rahmati et al. (Ref 37) further improved this model by explicitly taking into account of the effects of the oxide film removal process. These studies provide great advances toward numerical modeling and prediction of bonding during particle deposition. However, the implementation is quite complex, and it is not clear whether this method can be easily applicable to model particleparticle collision and dissimilar material bonding behaviors.",

The adhesive contact interactions among particles and those between particles and surface can be specified in the DEM framework ( Ref 39) . The DEM-based approach assumed that particles and substrates were rigid bodies ( Ref 47) . Under the high-velocity impact, however, the deformation of the particles and substrate becomes a significant factor in the deposition process, thus making it necessary to describe them as deformable bodies using appropriate constitutive laws ( Ref 48) . Consequently, it is challenging for DEM-based modeling to correctly predict global system behaviors or to properly capture relevant physics or mechanics of deposition during cold spray. Motivated by the challenges described above, the present study aims to conduct preliminary numerical development of a computational model that can simultaneously handle the deformation, bonding and rebounding of impacting particles during cold spray deposition in one unified theoretical framework. For this purpose, on the base of the peridynamics (PD), interfacial contact models were implemented to simulate the bonding between the impacting particle and the substrate. Due to the meshless discretization and nonlocal nature of PD, it is straightforward to add bond forces at the particle/substrate interface. These forces are highly tunable, making our method more flexible for modeling general cold spray depositions, regardless of the material types and bonding mechanisms. This more realistic model can also reproduce the adhesion strength of particle to the substrate that is consistent with experimental observations and can be naturally extended to include interaction and bonding between the same or dissimilar particles, thus making it possible to simulate multiparticle impacts and their effects on the first bonded particle adhesion. It is noted that the native oxide films covering the particle and substrate are not considered in our model, the focus of this study is to accurately describe particle-substrate (and potentially particle-particle) bonding behavior thus to pave the way for correctly simulating the coating build-up process. The modeling of oxide layer based on PD is under investigation and will be presented in another publication.",

            "text": "In this paper, instead of modeling of discontinuities, we propose an original approach in the framework of peridynamics to simulate physical processes of bonding formation in cold spray. This expands the scope of peridynamics to incorporate a variety of physics in which deformation and adhesion play an important role in system behavior. It is worth noting that the previous study by Jin et al. (Ref 55) has proposed a model that utilizes peridynamics for impact bonding. However, the bonding in that work was realized through enforcing material points across the interface to have the same velocities. Different from the work of Jin et al., here in our study bonding formation is treated differently in that it explicitly accounts for the repulsion and adhesion forces between material points, and the bond can be broken and re-form under certain criteria. Motivated from the interatomic potential in molecular dynamics (MD), we use a Lennard-Jones type potential as the representative to handle the bonding process due to impact. A force-stretch approach to simulate interface interaction that is directly derived from bulk material fracture response is also proposed. The contact model can be calibrated to achieve bonding, de-bonding, and the desired adhesion strength resulted from particles impacting. In the numerical implementation, the interaction of contacting bodies is realized by integrating contact forces on the pairs of nodes of meshless discretization of these two bodies. This kind of interaction is activated only when the nodes of opposing bodies are within a certain distance. It is noted that recently another particle-based method, i.e., the smoothed-particle hydrodynamics (SPH) has also been proposed as a means to model CS deposition (Ref 15) , in which metal-to-metal interface treatment was considered in a 2D SPH model. Our approach, however, differs from the SPH method in two main aspects. Theoretically, the PD approach solves integral equations and treats discontinuity (material interface) in a consistent way to the continuum (bulk material), while classical theory like SPH is based on partial differential equations (PDEs) ( Ref 49, 56) . Second, the bond forces between material points across the interface in the PD model is explicitly specified to give a desired adhesive effect, distinct from the artificial energy dissipation and velocity averaging technique used in SPH ( Ref 55, 57) . This paper is organized as follows. First, the peridynamic modeling approach and state-based peridynamic theory were introduced. Then the numerical discretization and implementation were described. Next, the contact models we developed to simulate impact bonding of particle and substrate were presented, followed by a section detailing the simulation details as well as the Johnson-Cook (JC) plasticity model used to describe the deformation of the particles and substrate are introduced. In the end, our results are summarized and the implication to modeling of cold spray was discussed.",

Two types of interactions are considered: (1) intra-solid interaction acting between material points within the solid that is subjected to the external boundary conditions, and (2) the inter-solid interaction governing the particle-particle and particle-substrate contacts that explicitly account for the compression and adhesion forces between distinct bodies. State-based peridynamics is used to model intra-solid interaction, that is, single solid deformation. For contacts, an MD interatomic-like potential and a force-stretch relation are proposed. The advantage of this contact model is its ability for describing irregular-shaped interfaces because the contact is applied between the material points rather than between the whole solids (Ref 48) , and the flexibility of complex contact via a potential function.",

To determine the contact between two bodies, a proximity search in the current configuration is performed by the detection algorithm to check the distance between the opposing nodes.

Then, an interfacial constitutive model is fitted based on the bulk material behavior and is Fig. 1 The proposed constitutive model 2 for characterizing interfacial properties J Therm Spray Tech named ''Exponential'' in Fig. 1 . The force-stretch model is set in form of a two-segment relation with a linear elastic behavior, and a damage evolution characterized by an exponential degradation. Based on this model, the attractive force between two material points which have been connected through an interface bond increases linearly by increasing the interfacial separation. Then, the force starts to reduce when the displacement across the interface reaches a threshold value, due to the bond breakage along the interface. This leads to the strength reduction or the ''softening'' of the bonding interface. Finally, when all bonds connecting the separated material are broken, the force becomes zero indicating complete de-bonding. The force-stretch relation of the interface is given by (Ref 72 )",

Figure 3 shows the resulted shapes as copper particles impact on copper substrates at the velocity of 400 m/s, 500 m/s, and 600 m/s, respectively, obtained from both the peridynamics method and FEM. We can see from the FEM results that the particle underwent significant deformation, resulting in a crater in the flat substrate and an obvious metal jetting at the rim. The peridynamics results compare fairly well with the simulation results from the FEM method, the de-facto Fig. 2 The 2D sketch and 3D peridynamics model of singleparticle deposition in cold spray standard method for single-particle impact in cold spray. This confirms validity and accuracy of the peridynamics method for simulating the impacting behaviors of particles during cold spray. Besides the deformation configurations, we also examined the equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ) distribution resulted from the impact. Figure 4 shows the equivalent plastic strain (PEEQ) distribution of a 30lm copper particle after impacting the substrate at a velocity of 400 m/s. The particle's periphery around the particle-substrate interface deforms most intensively (i.e., highest PEEQ) within a narrow band. The extreme and highly localized deformation causes jetting of material, and a significant temperature rise in the interface region (Fig. 5) . The increase in temperature leads to the loss of shear strength or thermal softening behavior described by the JC model. We see from Figs 4-5 that the peridynamic results match well with FEM, in terms of both the strain (i.e., PEEQ) and temperature profiles. One thing worth noting is that in FEM the outmost periphery of the deformed particle exhibits unphysically large PEEQ due to the highly distorted local elements, which has been reported in previous research (Ref 76) . In contrast, in peridymamics the domain is discretized into a set of nodes rather than elements so that the artificially large plastic strains observed in FEM result can be alleviated to some extent. However, owing to the total-Lagrangian nature of the traditional peridynamic theory, in which the interaction between material points is determined by a mapping between the current (deformed) and reference (undeformed) configurations, such unphysical phenomenon is not completely avoided under extremely large deformations.",

The remaining kinetic energy is then stored as elastic strain energy in the contacting bodies. Part of the recovered strain energy becomes energy toward rebounding, namely the rebounding energy. When the rebounding energy is strong, the particle will be able to overcome the adhesion and particle rebounding then occurs. To demonstrate the competition between the rebounding energy and adhesion, we consider a Cu particle of 30 lm in diameter impacting onto a flat Cu substrate at 500 m/s with varying levels of adhesion strength at the interface, shown in Fig. 6 . Specifically, the three scenarios presented in Fig. 6 . The scenario in Fig. 6(a) corresponds to impact using a repulsive only contact algorithm without adhesion force, which resembles the common case in FEM simulations. On the other hand, Fig. 6(b) shows the numerical simulations with contact model 1 and Fig. 3 The resulted deformation configurations of single copper particle impacts modeled by the peridynamics method (a-c) and FEM (d-f) at the velocity of 400, 500, and 600 m/s, respectively. The configuration snapshots were taken at 105 ns Fig. 6(c) shows the numerical simulations with contact model 2. These configurations were taken at the simulation time of 190 ns at which either rebounding or bonding has occurred, thus being effectively ''pseudo-final configurations.'' Clearly when there is no adhesion, rebounding occurs to result in particle-substrate separation as shown in the inset in Fig. 6(a) . While for the other two with contact models, the power particle remains adhered to the substrate after impact. Figure 6 clearly illustrated the critical role of adhesion. Below a more detailed, quantitative analysis of such role is presented. In the contact model 1, we know that the adhesion may be adjusted by the parameter b. A series of different initial velocity single-particle impact tests were performed with varying b. As stated previously, the particle deposition behavior depends on the competition between the rebounding energy (E r ) and adhesion energy (E a ). We define the final kinetic energy (E f ) of the particle after the impact",

Again, for simplicity, we use the case of a 30 lm Cu particle impacting a Cu substrate at the velocity of v i \u00bc 500; m=s as the representative case. We can see that the CoR is declining as b increases and drops to zero when b exceeds a threshold value of 4:5 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 . This plot illustrates the competition between the adhesion energy and the rebounding energy. The adhesion energy is able to offset 0045, but it is not sufficient to stop the particle detachment when b is less. Similar observations of CoR vs. b curves can be found for cases with different powder particle impact velocities, though the threshold b beyond which CoR becomes zero differ. Meanwhile, we also examined the effect of the parameter b on the velocity history. The results are shown in Fig. 8 , where negative velocities mean that the particle is approaching or deforming into the substrate, while positive velocities indicate that the particle is moving away from the substrate. As shown in this figure, the velocity magnitude of the particle is first dropping to zero at the beginning of the simulation. This means the particle is impacting the substrate and the kinetic energy is gradually dissipated as deformation progresses. Afterward, the velocity turns positive which indicates the elastic energy remained is driving the particle to bounce off.",

With the increase in the adhesion parameter b, the velocity drop after 135 ns becomes larger indicates larger adhesion force exerts on the particle by the substrate to slow down the bouncing particle. In the cases with high value of b, i.e., b \u00bc 4:5 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 and b \u00bc 5:0 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 , the velocity turns to negative which means the adhesion force is so strong that it pulls the particle backwards to substrate. This prevents the particle from debonding. Fig. 7 Coefficient of restitution as a function of adhesion parameter for 30 lm copper particle with the impact velocity of 400, 500, and 600 m=s, respectively Figure 9 shows the evolutions of contact force of the entire particle with respect to time in the simulations that employ contact model 1. This is calculated by integrating all contact forces of each material point within the particle that has an interaction with the material point inside the substrate. Again, the effect of adhesion parameter b is examined. Positive force represents repulsion, and negative force represents adhesive force. It can be seen that in all cases the contact force first increases drastically to avoid interpenetration during compression. The force drops quickly due to the deformation of the substrate and particle while they store their elastic energies. When the particle tries to bounce off, that is, during interface separation, the particle is subjected to tensile force. It also can be seen that larger b results in larger adhesion force as mentioned previously. For cases with relatively small b (up to 4:3 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 ), the contact force almost drops to zero after 304 ns while the velocity keeps positive and unchanged. This indicates the particle bounces off and is out of the action range of interface interaction. In the case of b \u00bc 5:0 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 , the force becomes positive again at the end of the simulation because the particle is moving toward the substrate, and the contact force turns repulsive when they are getting too close. As can be seen in Fig. 8 , for b \u00bc 5:0 \u00c2 10 \u00c03 the velocity of the particle is-18.7 m/s at 270 ns where the contact force is 0.02 N (Fig. 9 ). This repulsion force slows down the particle to-0.98 m/s after 34 ns during which the force increases to 0.09 N. In the next few nanoseconds, the particle will be pushed back to equilibrium distance where the net contact force is zero.",

Figure 10 shows the evolution of the contact force of the entire particle with respect to time in the simulation that Fig. 9 , it can be found that the evolution of the contact force exhibits more oscillation, compared to those obtained using contact model 1.

The explicit formulation of adhesion in our approach enables us to calibrate the model parameters to reproduce the actual bonding strength, e.g., particle on substrate, when experimental measurements are available. To further illustrate this, below we demonstrate one possible means to achieve this.",

            "text": "Starting with a single-particle impact simulation, we can produce the after-impact configurations. The configuration prior to particle rebounding can then be recreated by duplicating the coordinates and volumes of all the material points, but with velocities zeroed. Subsequently, a numerical tensile test, illustrated in Fig. 11a can be performed in which the particle is rigidly displaced away from the substrate. The force required in this process is recorded. Fig. 11b illustrates a typical force-displacement response expected for the adhesion force, where the force would first increase, reach a peak value, and then gradually drop to zero. This numerical test resembles the tensile pull-off test typically seen in experiments for bond strength measurement of the coating to the substrate, except that we did this numerical test on one single particle. In experiments, the coating is bonded to a high-strength epoxy resin to be pulled off the substrate. The ratio of the maximum load to the sample's cross-section area is considered as the adhesion strength ( Ref 79, 80) . In the numerical test, the single bonded particle is pulled off the substrate and the force needed to break all the bonds between material points adjacent to the interface is recorded. To compare the adhesion stress obtained from simulation to the macroscopic experimental data, the simulated peak force of a single particle can be multiplied by the number density of particles in a certain area of an experiment sample to calculate the averaged adhesion strength (Ref 81). The above is more of a proof-of-concept type demo. The numerical test can certainly be made more sophisticated to better resemble the experimental test if necessary. Besides the tensile pull-off test, there are, of course, other types of experiments to measure the bond strength. One of them is the shear test, in which a stylus is used to apply tangential force on a single particle to shear the splat along the substrate. Then the difference between the baseline tangential force and the peak tangential force, divided by projected area of the particle is obtained as the adhesion strength ( Ref 82, 83) . One can also design the corresponding numerical test, depending on the shear experiments, for the calibration of the proposed model parameters.",
