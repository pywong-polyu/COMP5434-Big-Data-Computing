For example, tests that measure the ability to identify odors may confound sensory performance with memory recall, verbal ability, and past experience with the odor. Conversely, threshold-based tests typically avoid these issues, but are labor intensive. Additionally, many commercially available olfactory tests are slow and may require a trained administrator, making them impractical for use in a short wellness visit or other broad clinical assessment. Methods: We tested the performance of the Adaptive Olfactory Measure of Threshold (ArOMa-T)a novel odor detection threshold test that employs an adaptive Bayesian algorithm paired with a disposable odor-delivery cardin a non-clinical sample of individuals (n=534) at the 2021 Twins Day Festival in Twinsburg, OH.",

Notably, quantitative tests are not optimized to assess qualitative disorders like parosmia (distorted smell) or phantosmia (distorted smell), which depend on patient report. Quantitative tests typically measure one or more specific parameters: odor identification (\"what is this? vanilla!\"), odor discrimination (\"is this smell different from the last one?\"), and odor detection threshold (\"what is the lowest concentration the patient can smell?\").

For example, odor identification tasks require the patient to a) smell the stimulus, b) recognize the stimulus from prior experience, and c) communicate the correct name. Thus, this measure confounds sensory performance with memory recall and verbal ability. Odor identification may also be challenging if stimuli are culturally or experientially dependent (e.g., root beer is widely known in the United States, but not Europe or Asia). Thus, odor identification tests should be validated (15) in different populations and global locations prior to mainstream clinical use to obtain appropriate normative data. Further, odor identification tests make cognitive demands that may pose issues for elderly patients or other special populations (e.g., children, or those with cognitive impairments). Odor discrimination tests also have cognitive demands, particularly regarding working memory, that can limit their use in such populations.",

Such tests are semantics-free, thus avoiding issues of familiarity, naming, and recall (16) . They also may be more sensitive and/or specific measures of hyposmia and anosmia. That is, the odorants given in an odor identification task are normally presented at a concentration well above threshold, so a small but real drop in olfactory function may be missed (17) . In this case, the drop may not impair the ability of the patient to successfully identify and name the odor, despite the presence of a true quantitative loss. Still, odor detection threshold tests are used much less frequently in clinical settings, in part due to difficulties with stimulus control and test duration. Indeed, threshold estimation using traditional methods (such as a 2-down / 1-up staircase) (18) can take 30 minutes or more to get a single measure of threshold.",

When participants were presented with two blanks (versus one), the false alarm ratethe fraction of participants who responded YES to all blankswas dramatically reduced from 7.5% to 2.6%. In future studies or in clinical use, it will be trivial to adjust the algorithm to require multiple blank trials for every participant.

Elsewhere, it was reported that the majority of COVID-19 patients had impaired olfactory thresholds when tested with the Connecticut Chemosensory Clinical Research Center orthonasal olfaction test approximately two weeks after a positive SARS-CoV-2 PCR test (40) . Further, it has been reported that olfactory threshold scores from Sniffin' Sticks were more affected than scores for odor identification and discrimination in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 tested ~1 month after diagnosis (41) .

Self-report can be subject to recall bias, and many with measurable loss may be unaware of this loss (43, 44) . On the other hand, measures of subjective loss or dysfunction may better capture quality of life issues, including dietary intake (45) . Notably, qualitative disorders like parosmia and phantosmia can only be assessed via patient history and self-report, as no objective tests exist for these conditions (3). Our results conflict somewhat with some prior work, as we saw no convincing evidence that thresholds were elevated in those who had recovered from COVID-19. However, this was a small convenience sample of individuals without active COVID-19, and we have no estimate of the elapsed time between illness and olfactory testing. Additional work in larger cohorts with recruitment stratified by current COVID-19 status and/or past history is warranted to resolve these questions. The ArOMa-T may be especially well-suited for such study designs, given that it is mailable, rapid, and suitable for field use.",

            "text": "Several limitations should be noted. Foremost, the sample was predominantly non-Hispanic white, so results may not generalize to other demographic groups. Also, the test setting could have biased recruitment of older individuals towards those in exceptionally good health -i.e., a 'healthy worker effect' (38) . This may partially explain why some participants in the 58-77 age category show the same or a lower olfactory detection threshold as those in the 18-37 age category. Thus, we cannot make sweeping generalizations about aging. Further, our heritability estimate is highly uncertain , as the sample size (of twin pairs) is too small. Finally, while PEA is commonly used in olfactory testing in part because specific anosmias for this compound are rare, we cannot exclude that performance on this test may vary as a function of individual genetics. The moderate heritability observed here could reflect numerous causes of differences in overall olfactory ability including differences in specific anosmias, nasal patency, or myriad other factors that are shared by monozygotic siblings. Additional work in larger and more deliberately stratified samples will be necessary to resolve these questions.",

We observed differences in estimated detection thresholds between sex and age groups, highlighting the ability of the ArOMa-T to reproduce expected population level findings, as well as demonstrating its ability serve as a portable and rapid smell test. This is highly advantageous compared to other olfactory tests that take longer to complete, have portability limitations, or must be administered by a trained individual. In a field-based convenience sample, no evidence was found to suggest detection thresholds differ between participants who report a history of COVID-19 and matched controls who did not. However, these tentative null results require confirmation in a study specifically designed to explore this question.",

This odorant is used widely in smell testing, including in commercial smell tests marketed by Sensonics International (UPSIT; Haddon Heights, NJ) and Burghart GmbH (Sniffin' Sticks; Holm, Germany). PEA does not activate the trigeminal nerve, so it is commonly used in odor detection threshold tasks, which do not require any recognition or familiarity of the stimulus name or associated odor. PEA also has abundant normative data (e.g. (20)). Each ArOMa-T card contains three labels with no odorant, one label each of the lowest and highest odorant concentrations, and two each for the intermediate odorant concentrations. The interval between adjacent concentrations are half-log steps (i.e, 0.5 log10 units of concentration, or half an order of magnitude), and the range of concentrations was chosen to roughly span the range of normal human detection thresholds for PEA; the highest concentration contained in the card is arbitrarily denoted as 0 on the log10 scale. In this version of the ArOMa-T card, the position of individual PEA concentrations is fixed and unknown to the participants.",

The test includes a bifold card graphics and text on the outside pages (A) and with user instruction and 17 peel and burst panels that contain varying amounts of the rose-like/floral odorant phenyl ethyl alcohol (PEA) on the inside pages (B). The unfolded card is approximately 9.5 x 11.15 inches (~241 mm by ~286 mm), and the folded card fits easily within a standard 7 in x 10 in envelope for potential delivery via mail. Participants are guided through the task with an accompanying smartphone/tablet app or cloud-based web app that indicates which panel should be peeled and sniffed next. Labels 1-16 contain different PEA concentrations covering a range of ~3.5 log10 units, while label 0 has no added odor as is presented as a reference for the background smell of the label and card. Some labels contain identical concentrations, and some labels are blanks with no PEA added. The blanks and PEA concentrations are distributed across positions in a quasirandom manner so that users cannot infer any information about concentration from position on the card.",

The detection threshold (X-axis) is expressed in the base-10 logarithm of the nominal concentrations. Propensity matching and past COVID-19 status The ANOVA model testing for an effect of positive COVID-19 history on smell threshold did not find an association between COVID-19 history and odor detection threshold [F(1,152)=0.11; p=0.74]. Specifically, the mean threshold estimate of participants without a past history of COVID-19 was -1.96 \u00b1 1.46, compared to -1.88 \u00b1 1.30 for participants who reported a prior COVID-19 infection, a nominal difference of ~0.08 log units (~1.2x difference). Likewise, we found no evidence for a difference in the threshold distributions between participants who previously had COVID-19 and those who did not (KS test statistic = 0.09; p=0.91). Collectively, these exploratory analyses provide no evidence that odor thresholds are elevated in a convenience sample of individuals who have previously recovered from acute COVID-19. However, this finding is only tentative and should be confirmed in larger samples with specific study recruitment intended for such comparisons.",
