            "text": "It has been widely observed that adult men of all ages are at higher risk of developing serious complications from COVID-19 when compared with women. This study aimed to investigate the association of COVID-19 positivity and severity with estrogen exposure in women, in a population based matched cohort study of female users of the COVID Symptom Study application in the UK. Analyses included 152,637 women for menopausal status, 295,689 women for exogenous estrogen intake in the form of the combined oral contraceptive pill (COCP), and 151,193 menopausal women for hormone replacement therapy (HRT). Data were collected using the COVID Symptom Study in May-June 2020. Analyses investigated associations between predicted or tested COVID-19 status and menopausal status, COCP use, and HRT use, adjusting for age, smoking and BMI, with follow-up age sensitivity analysis, and validation in a subset of participants from the TwinsUK cohort. Menopausal women had higher rates of predicted COVID-19 (P = 0.003). COCP-users had lower rates of predicted COVID-19 (P = 8.03E-05), with reduction in hospital attendance (P = 0.023). Menopausal women using HRT or hormonal therapies did not exhibit consistent associations, including increased rates of predicted COVID-19 (P = 2.22E-05) for HRT users alone. The findings support a protective effect of estrogen exposure on COVID-19, based on positive association between predicted COVID-19 with menopausal status, and negative association with COCP use. HRT use was positively associated with COVID-19, but the results should be considered with caution due to lack of data on HRT type, route of administration, duration of treatment, and potential unaccounted for confounders and comorbidities.",

A recent review of biological sex and COVID-19 has described the male bias in COVID-19 mortality in 37 of the 38 countries that have provided sex-disaggregated data [1] . Of women who develop COVID-19, being post-menopausal has been independently associated with more severe COVID-19 [2] . Epidemiological data from previous coronavirus outbreaks, including SARS-CoV (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus) and MERS-CoV (Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus) showed the same pattern: among men, morbidity and fatality rates were markedly higher compared to women [3, 4] . Although pregnant women are more likely to be admitted to intensive care or to receive ventilation than non-pregnant women of reproductive age [5] , they generally experience milder COVID-19 symptoms than initially expected [5, 6] .",

Anti-m\u00fcllerian hormone (AMH) and estradiol are markers of high ovarian reserve and have been shown to negatively correlate with severity of COVID-19, independent of age, suggesting that pre-menopausal women are somewhat protected against severe COVID-19 [11] .",

Three epigenetic age calculators were applied, DNAm GrimAge [18] , DNAm PhenoAge [19] and the original Horvath methylation age [20] . Epigenetic age acceleration measures were obtained from regressing epigenetic age on chronological age, and also included blood intrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (IEAA) and extrinsic epigenetic age acceleration (EEAA) [21] . IEAA is calculated by regressing the Horvath DNA methylation age and cell blood counts to estimate cell intrinsic methylation ageing independent of differences in blood cell counts. EEAA is calculated based on epigenetic ageing measures developed by Hannum et al. [22] , up-weighted by the relative proportion of three age-related blood immune cells (na\u00efve (CD45RA+CCR7+) cytotoxic T cells, exhausted (CD28-CD45RA-) cytotoxic T cells, and plasmablasts). EEAA has been proposed to capture aspects of age-related immuno-senescence [21] . A one-sided t-test was applied to compare each of the five age acceleration measures to symptoms and predicted COVID-19 status, and results are presented at nominal significance.",

The symptom-based predictive COVID-19 model had a sensitivity of 65% in a UK-based cohort from the COVID Symptom Study app, and the strongest predictor was anosmia [27] . The individuals on which the prediction model was trained were highly selected as COVID-19 testing was not performed at random when the app was initially launched, although testing criteria have since been extended. Additionally, sampling using an app will under-represent individuals without smartphones, including older participants, and is likely to under-represent those severely affected by COVID-19. Furthermore, some COVID-19 symptoms may differ in population subgroups such as menopausal women and affect model performance. However, the majority of significant results obtained for predicted COVID-19 in our study showed a similar direction of association in the small subset of self reported tested COVID-19 cases.",

Specifically, there may be levels of confounding between risk factors for COVID-19, such as BMI and smoking, and factors influencing the likelihood of being prescribed hormone therapy. For example, in the COCP analyses smoking, obesity and older age (> 35 years) increase the risk of thrombotic events in women using combined hormonal contraceptives [28] , and alternatives may be advised. Therefore, in our study, women > 35 years on COCP may be healthier than others of similar age. There is also potential for selection bias where, for example, experiencing specific problems and symptoms influences the likelihood of hormonal therapy use. Although we consider multiple key covariates such as age, BMI, and smoking, these factors likely have more complex effects on the response variable and potentially on other covariates, than the effects that we capture using main effects linear models.",

As such, untangling the effect of differing types of HRT was not possible. Most COCPs contain between 20-35 micrograms of ethinylestradiol along with a progestogen, while HRT estradiol doses are generally lower and more physiological. As such, lower estrogen doses and lack of detailed data may have resulted in the lack of effect seen amongst HRT-users.

Moreover, the absence of periods does not necessarily equate to a diagnosis of menopause, particularly in women in their early 40s.

The innate recognition and response to viruses as well as downstream adaptive immune responses during viral infections are known to differ between females and males [9] . It has been wellillustrated that females generally mount greater inflammatory, antiviral, and humoral immune responses than males during viral infections [30] , which contributes to better clearance of viruses, including SARS-CoV [7] . This heightened inflammatory response is advantageous in response to infection and sepsis, but is unfavourable in immune responses against self, leading to more autoimmune disease in women compared to men [31, 32] . Additionally, enhanced immunity in females can also result in greater immuno-pathology and tissue damage at later stages of viral disease, such as during influenza A virus infection [33] . In line with these observations, women are at greater risk for developing long COVID, compared to men [34] . Conversely, maternal physiological adaptations to pregnancy usually predispose pregnant women to a more severe course of many infections, including viral pneumonia, with subsequent higher maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality [35] , but observational cohort studies in COVID-19 have reported that pregnant women are less likely to show symptoms of fever, shortness of breath, and muscle pains than non-pregnant women of reproductive age [6] . Estrogen levels increase more than 100-fold in pregnancy [36] providing a potential mechanism for the unique resistance to COVID-19. Milder COVID-19 symptomology could also be linked to the physiological changes observed in women over the gestation period.",

            "text": "With ageing, a general decline in immune function is observed-immune-senescence. Several of these changes are gender specific and affect post-menopausal women. Levels of estrogen, for example, 17\u03b2-estradiol (E2), are variable during the menstrual cycle, high during pregnancy and low after menopause in females. Progesterone (P4) levels are also very high in pregnant women, and P4 is essential to establish and maintain gestation by limiting local and systemic pro-inflammatory immune responses [37] . While progesterone is considered immunosuppressive, estrogens in general are considered immune-stimulatory [38] . Estrogens exert their effects partly through binding to ER\u03b1 or ER\u03b2, which are expressed in various types of immune cells, including lymphocytes, macrophages, and dendritic cells [39] . E2 thus affects many components of innate immunity, including the functional activity of innate immune cells that influence downstream adaptive immune responses [9] . This is dependent on hormone concentration, in addition to density, distribution and receptor type found in immune cells. As a consequence, lower circulating estrogen levels due to ageing leads to a dampened immune response in older women. For example, in post-menopausal women, a second peak in Human papilloma virus (HPV) prevalence has been reported [40, 41] . New HPV infections in older women with no sexual activity are thought to be due to reduced immune responses [42] . HIV-1 infection is also increasing in post-menopausal women [43] , where a European study found that women over 45 have a 4-fold increased risk of acquiring HIV compared to women under 45 years of age [44] . A recent cohort study of 68,466 patients with COVID-19 from 17 countries found that the fatality risk for women > 50 years receiving estradiol therapy was reduced by more than 50% compared with non-users (OR = 0.33, hazard ratio (HR) = 0.29) [45] . Recent results based on the Oxford-Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Research and Surveillance Centre (RSC) database of 1,863,478 women show that HRT use was associated with a significantly lower likelihood of all-cause mortality in COVID-19 (unadjusted OR = 0.15, 95% CI 0.06-0.37, adjusted OR = 0.22, 95% CI 0.05-0.94, p = 0.041) [46] .",
