Amplicon-based sequencing methods provide a sensitive, low-cost and rapid approach but suffer a high potential for contamination, which can undermine lab processes and results. This challenge will only increase with expanding global production of sequences by diverse research groups for epidemiological and clinical interpretation. We present an approach which uses synthetic DNA spike-ins (SDSIs) to track samples and detect inter-sample contamination through a sequencing workflow. Applying this approach to the ARTIC Consortium's amplicon design, we define a series of best practices for Illumina-based sequencing and provide a detailed characterization of approaches to increase sensitivity for low-viral load samples incorporating the SDSIs. We demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the SDSI method amidst a real-time investigation of a suspected hospital cluster of SARS-CoV-2 cases.",

In particular, viral genome sequencing has been used to characterize the epidemiology of clusters and superspreading events 1-3 . Concurrently, genome sequencing to monitor the emergence of new lineages and the spread of variants of concern (VoC) has been a of global priority 4 .

Many labs performing viral sequencing are often processing multiple large batches (96) of samples in parallel, further increasing chances of direct cross contamination or sample swapping 12 . Moreover, as SARS-CoV-2 has relatively low genetic diversity and high superspreading potential 13, 14 , many genomes are expected to be identical at the consensus level, a pattern that could also be observed due to contamination 11, [15] [16] [17] .

The SDSI primers did not produce any nonspecific amplification, including in the presence of cDNA from a nasopharyngeal swab sample, supporting the expectation that primers shared limited homology with genomic material from clinical samples (Sup Fig 1b) . All SDSIs amplified in an ARTIC SARS-CoV-2 PCR reaction with SDSI primers included, in each case yielding a single clean product of the expected size (Sup Fig 1c) . To prevent SDSIs from overtaking the amplification and sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 amplicons, we optimized the amount of SDSI added to each reaction through limited titration (Fig 2b; Sup Fig 2) . Through a dilution series we found that 1\u03bcl of a 1fM SDSI resulted in the reliable detection of the SDSI across a range of CT values (CT 20, 25, 30, 35) while the majority of reads (>96%) still mapped to SARS-CoV-2 with no apparent alteration in coverage across the genome (Fig 2b; Sup Table 2) .",

In Sample 47, 96% of reads mapping to all SDSIs mapped to the expected SDSI (SDSI_47) while 4% mapped to SDSI_48. We recommend manual curation of genomes assembled from any sample with <99% of SDSI reads mapping to the expected SDSI, and therefore compared the genome from Sample 47 to that of the potentially contaminating sample (Sample 48). Ultimately no further genome validation was warranted because we did not assemble a genome from Sample 47 and it was removed from further analyses. Interestingly, assembled portions of the genome revealed two single nucleotide variations (SNVs) that differentiated it from the genome from Sample 48, which indicates that viral reads did not solely originate from contamination. Nevertheless, this case reveals the potential prevalence of undetected contamination and underscores the importance of a method for identifying it.",

Viral sequence variation can distinguish between a common source of infection, characterized by many identical or highly genetically similar sequences, and independently acquired infections, that are expected to be genetically distinct. Identification of multiple identical genomes within a batch can also call into question the validity of such findings, which is challenging to rule out given standard amplicon-based sequencing workflows. Therefore, cluster investigations which aim to confirm or refute transmission events based on viral sequence would greatly benefit from SDSIs to ensure they exclude laboratory contamination. To this end, we sequenced 22 samples with SDSI+ARTIC; 14 samples suspected to be part of the cluster based on epidemiological contact-tracing, and 8 unlinked samples as controls.",

Our in silico design generated robust synthetic targets while mitigating inter-spike-in sequence homology as well as homology with human, SARS-CoV-2, and common laboratory reagents. SDSIs can readily be adopted by laboratories and platforms of all sizes with only minor changes to existing methodologies, little additional cost per sample ($0.006 in our hands), and no interruption or addition of time to standard workflow methodologies. While broadly applicable to most amplicon-based approaches, we coupled the SDSIs to an improved ARTIC amplicon sequencing protocol for recovering genomes from low viral load samples.",

Alternative approaches for the recovery of genomes from samples with low viral load include the use of targeted enrichment approaches 30, 31 which are more costly and time-consuming. Recent reports of SARS-CoV-2 variants that can affect viral transmissibility, virulence, and susceptibility to pre-existing immunity pose a need for rapid and accurate viral genome sequencing to inform patient care and infection control interventions. Our application of SDSI+ARTIC confirming a cluster representing nosocomial transmission further emphasizes the utility of the SDSIs to confidently identify samples of high genetic similarity.",

Additional synthetic targets could be designed using the same principles to expand into 384 well formats and beyond. Moreover, the approach is applicable to both Illumina and Nanopore sequencing platforms as well as any other existing or future tiled amplicon panel, such as those previously used for Zika, Ebola, and other recent outbreaks 27, 32 . Primer sites could also be easily adapted for integration with new advancements in amplicon sequencing, like tailed primer approaches 8 . SDSIs could serve as a broad tool for tracing potential contamination across a plethora of fields that employ amplicon based genomic sequencing, such as food safety, species identification and environmental sampling.

Pool #1 primers consisted of all odd numbered amplicons whereas pool #2 primers consisted of all even numbered amplicons. To generate the 100\u03bcM pool #1 primer stock, we combined 5\u03bcL of each 100\u03bcM pool #1 primer, and repeated this protocol for the even numbered primers to give a 100\u03bcM pool #2 primer stock. We selected a total of 20 amplicons as regions of low coverage from previous sequencing data (Sup Table 3 ). Low coverage amplicons were present in both pools, with 11 coming from pool #1 and 9 coming from pool #2. For the primer 2x pools, we spiked in primers for the corresponding amplicons at 2x the concentration (20.8nM final) of the other primers in the pool. For these low coverage primers, we used 10\u03bcL of the 100\u03bcM stock rather than 5\u03bcL. We diluted both the original and 2x primer pools 1:10 in nuclease free water to generate a 10\u03bcM working stock. We then selected 8 samples with varying CT values to determine if selectively increasing primer concentrations reduced amplicon dropout. We used our modified ARTIC protocol and processed each sample with both the original primer pool, as well as the 2x primer pool, then sequenced these 16 samples on an Illumina Miseq (V2 reagent kit) with 2 x 150 paired end sequencing.",

Our modified ARTIC pipeline began synthesizing cDNA on 2.5\u03bcL of DNAsed RNA using Superscript IV. In order to increase sample throughput and bypass an additional more laborious quantification step post the ARTIC PCR, we normalized cDNA samples that had a high viral load (CT<27) to a CT of 27. To prepare for the ARTIC PCR, we transferred 5\u03bcL of the normalized cDNA to a new plate and added 1\u03bcL of a SDSI.
