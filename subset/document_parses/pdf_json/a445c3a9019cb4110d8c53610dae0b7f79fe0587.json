            "text": "The pandemic spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; [1] [2] [3] ) is an ongoing international health crisis with over 245 million infections and 5 million reported deaths worldwide to date (WHO; https://covid19.who.int; November 2021). The spectrum of SARS-CoV-2-related disease (Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)) is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic viral shedding to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiorgan failure, and death. Besides coughing, dyspnea, and fatigue, fever (also known as pyrexia) is one of the most frequently reported symptoms [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . Fever is an evolutionarily conserved response to microbial infection and inflammation that can influence the regulation of multiple cellular processes, including host innate and adaptive immune responses [9, 10] . Unlike hyperthermia or heat stroke, fever represents a controlled shift in body temperature regulation induced by the expression of exogenous (microbial) and endogenous (host) pyrogenic regulatory factors, including pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and proinflammatory cytokines (e.g., interleukin 6 (IL-6)) [9, 10] . Body temperature naturally varies throughout the day, with age, sex, and ethnic origin being contributing factors [9, 10] . In healthy middle-aged adults, febrile temperatures range from 38 to 41\u02daC (\u0394T approximately 1 to 4\u02daC above baseline), with low (38 to 39\u02daC), moderate (39.1 to 40\u02daC), high (40.1 to 41.1\u02daC), and hyperpyrexia (>41.1\u02daC) temperature ranges [10] . Temperature elevation is known to confer protection against a number of respiratory pathogens [9, 11] , with antipyretic drug treatment leading to increased mortality in intensive care unit (ICU) patients infected with influenza A virus (IAV) [12] [13] [14] .",

In vitro studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 replicates more efficiently at lower temperatures associated with the upper respiratory airway (33\u02daC), which correlates with an overall weaker interferon (IFN)-mediated immune response to infection relative to lower respiratory airway (37\u02daC) infection [16] . These data suggest that tissue temperature could be a significant factor in the host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease progression. However, it remains to be determined what effect elevated temperature (>37\u02daC) has on SARS-CoV-2 replication. We therefore set out to determine the net effect of temperature elevation on SARS-CoV-2 infection within respiratory epithelial tissue.",

We show that respiratory epithelium remains permissive to SARS-CoV-2 infection at temperatures up to 40\u02daC, but to restrict the initiation of viral transcription leading to reduced levels of viral RNA (vRNA) replication and apical shedding of infectious virus. We identify temperature to play an important role in the differential regulation of multiple epithelial host responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection, including epigenetic, long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), and immunity-related pathways. Our data identify an important role for tissue temperature in the epithelial restriction of SARS-CoV-2 replication independently of canonical IFN-mediated antiviral immune defenses previously reported to restrict SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Infection of respiratory airway cultures with SARS-CoV-2 (England/02/2020; MOI 0.05, 10 4 plaque-forming unit (PFU)/Tissue) at 37\u02daC demonstrated these tissues to support infection and viral replication, with intraepithelial and apical vRNA accumulation readily detected by in situ hybridization (ISH) by 72 h postinfection (Fig 1A and 1B) . Notably, we observed discrete clusters of vRNA accumulation within respiratory epithelia (Fig 1A, arrows) , indicative of localized areas of intraepithelial infection, propagation, and spread [29, 30] . The overall morphology of the respiratory epithelium remained largely intact, with little shedding of ciliated cells from the epithelial surface ( Fig 1A, 120 h) . Measurement of genome copies by reverse transcription quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) and infectious virus by TCID 50 in apical washes collected over time demonstrated the linear phase of virus release to occur between 48 and 120 h (Fig 1C and 1D) . A substantial drop in apical infectious titers was observed at 144 h postinfection (Fig 1D) , consistent with multiple waves of virus release over prolonged periods of incubation in primary airway cultures [31] .",

            "text": "While the heat stress response has been extensively investigated in two-dimensional (2D) cell culture model systems [32, 33] , this pathway remains poorly characterized in 3D respiratory epithelia under air-liquid interface (ALI). We therefore investigated the influence of temperature on our 3D respiratory model. Mock-treated respiratory cultures were incubated at 37, 39, or 40\u02daC (representative of core body temperature and low to moderate grade febrile temperatures, respectively) prior to tissue fixation or RNA extraction and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq). H&E staining and transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) measurements demonstrated no morphological or membrane integrity changes to the respiratory epithelium upon temperature elevation (Fig 2A and 2B ). RNA-Seq analysis of respiratory epithelia demonstrated no difference in the expression level of ACE2 (Fig 2C, p = 0 .6753) or a reference set of 24 genes known to be constitutively expressed across a wide range of tissues and cell types (Fig 2D, p = 0.2136; [34] [35] [36] ) upon temperature elevation. These data indicate that general transcription remains largely unperturbed at elevated temperatures up to 40\u02daC. Out of the 867 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) identified ( Fig 2E; Q < 0.05), DEG enrichment was observed across multiple pathways in tissues incubated at 40 relative to 37\u02daC, including cellular response to stress, RNA polymerase I promoter opening, and DNA methylation (Fig 2F and S1 Data). Significant DEG enrichment was also observed in cellular response to heat stress ( Fig 2F [arrow] , 2G; S1 Data). We conclude that our respiratory model induces a significant heat stress response at elevated temperature without visible damage to the epithelium or induction of innate immune defenses that may otherwise influence the interpretation of SARS-CoV-2 replication studies at elevated temperature.",

Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 infection at 37\u02daC for 24 h prior to temperature upshift also led to reduced genome copy titers in apical washes (Fig 3C; p = 0 .0056).

Amplicon sequencing of vRNA isolated from donor 1 apical washes at 72 h identified a total of 7 unique singlenucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relative to input sequence with no indels being identified (Table 1 and S2 Data). SNPs were only identified in genomic sequences isolated from apical washes incubated at 37\u02daC (Table 1) . Thus, the temperature-dependent restriction observed in SARS-CoV-2 replication at 40\u02daC is not a consequence of viral mutation. As the generation of SNPs requires vRNA replication, the absence of genomic SNPs at 40\u02daC may reflect a temperature-dependent block in vRNA replication. To investigate this, we quantified the intracellular levels of vRNA from within infected tissues. RT-qPCR analysis using 2 independent primerprobe sets (N and ORF1a) demonstrated significantly lower levels of intracellular vRNA in tissues incubated at 40\u02daC relative to control samples ( Fig 4C) . ISH staining of tissue sections confirmed abundant levels of intraepithelial vRNA accumulation within all infected tissues incubated at 37\u02daC, with little to no staining observed at 40\u02daC (Fig 4D) .

Investigating further, we compared the transcriptome profiles from SARS-CoV-2-infected tissues at 37 and 40\u02daC. Out of the 1,934 DEGs (Q < 0.05) identified (Fig 6A) , pathway analysis identified immune system and cytokine-related pathways to be suppressed during SARS-CoV-2 infection at 40 relative to 37\u02daC (Fig 6B and 6C and ",

DEG analysis identified IFNB1 (IFN\u03b2) and IFNL1-3 (IFN\u03bb) transcript levels to only be up-regulated above 1 CPM during SARS-CoV-2 infection at 37\u02daC (Fig 6D and S8 Data) . While a small number of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) were identified to be up-regulated within infected tissues at 40\u02daC relative to mock treatment (9 ISGs in total; S3 Fig), no net increase in immune DEG expression was observed between mock or SARS-CoV-2-infected tissues at 40\u02daC relative to mock treatment at 37\u02daC (Fig 6C) . Together, these data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection of respiratory epithelia at 40\u02daC fails to induce a robust IFN response. To corroborate this result, we performed RT-qPCR on RNA extracted from mock or SARS-CoV-2-infected tissues derived from multiple donors. The induction of IFNB1 and IFNL1 expression was readily observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected tissues at 37\u02daC, with no significant change observed during infection at 40\u02daC relative to mock-treated samples (Figs 6E and S6). Similarly, significant levels of ISG induction (Mx1, ISG15, and IFIT2) were only observed in SARS-CoV-2-infected tissues at 37\u02daC (Figs 6F and S6). Notably, the levels of ISG induction at 37\u02daC were relatively weak (3-to 6-fold relative to mock treatment; Fig 6F) , indicative of low levels of innate immune stimulation at 72 h postinfection [20, 39] . Infection of respiratory cultures treated with the Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor Ruxolitinib (Ruxo; 5 \u03bcM), which blocks IFN-mediated JAK-STAT signaling during virus infection [40, 41] , demonstrated no significant change in SARS-CoV-2 apical titers relative to carrier control (DMSO) treatment ( Fig  6G) .

Temperature elevation to 40\u02daC restricted SARS-CoV-2 replication, with or without preincubation at elevated temperature, relative to infection at 37\u02daC (S7 Fig) . Collectively, these data demonstrate the temperature-dependent restriction of SARS-CoV-2 replication to occur independently of IFN-mediated antiviral immune defenses.",

Importantly, a substantial decrease in the expression of viral subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs) was also detected at elevated temperature ( Fig 7E, p = 0 .0018). As the expression of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNAs requires the onset of viral transcription [44] , these data identify tissue temperature to play an important role in the regulation of viral transcription. Correspondingly, indirect immunofluorescence staining of tissue sections demonstrated significantly fewer SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) positive foci in tissues infected at 40 relative to 37\u02daC, confirming reduced levels of viral gene expression (Fig 7F and 7G , p < 0.0001). Costaining of tissue sections for Mx1 expression, a well-established ISG product (Fig 6D and 6F ), demonstrated Mx1 expression to be localized in proximity to SARS-CoV-2 infectious foci at 37\u02daC, with little to no staining observed within infected (Fig 7F) .

The differentiation of stratified respiratory epithelium has proven to be a valuable research tool to investigate the cellular tropism, replication kinetics, and immune regulation of SARS-CoV-2, as these tissue models mimic many aspects of infection observed in animal models and COVID-19 patients [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] 29, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . While the use of such 3D models represents an important advancement over traditional two-dimensional cell culture systems, the absence of circulating immune cells (e.g., macrophages, natural killer cells, dendritic cells, and neutrophils), which modulate fever and proinflammatory immune responses to infection is an important limiting factor [9, 10, 50] . Thus, we limit our conclusions to the effect of elevated temperature on SARS-CoV-2 infection and replication within respiratory epithelium. Consistent with previous reports [16, 17, [19] [20] [21] 30, 38, 49] , SARS-CoV-2 infection of respiratory epithelium at 37\u02daC induced a proinflammatory immune signature (S2D Fig; IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03bb1-3). While SARS-CoV-2 is known to induce a comparatively weak immune response relative to other respiratory viruses (e.g., IAV) [20, 39] , we observed localized areas of epithelial infection (Fig 1A, arrows) that were coincident with elevated levels of ISG expression by 72 h postinfection (Fig 7F, Mx1) . These findings are consistent with reports that have shown localized areas of infection in the respiratory airway of infected ferrets and surface epithelium of organoid cultures [29] [30] [31] 49] . Thus, the proportion of epithelial infection and/or rate of intraepithelial spread may account for the differences observed in immune signature reported between different respiratory pathogens [20, 51] . As we observed localized areas of ISG induction, our data support a model of infection where cytokine (e.g., IFN) receptor-binding consumption kinetics may be a rate limiting factor in the protection of respiratory epithelia to SARS-CoV-2 infection [52, 53] . Such observations warrant further investigation to determine whether these localized areas of epithelial immune protection are induced by specific cytokines (e.g., IFN\u03b2 or IFN\u03bb1-3) and/or correlate with COVID-19 disease progression.",

Temperature elevation alone was not sufficient to block SARS-CoV-2 entry (Figs 3, 4, and S7), but refractory to SARS-CoV-2 transcription leading to reduced levels of vRNA accumulation and apical shedding of infectious virus (Figs 3, 4, and 7). Thus, we identify febrile temperatures associated with COVID-19 to play an important role in limiting the epithelial replication of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Importantly, SARS-CoV-2 restriction occurred independently of the robust induction of type-I (IFN\u03b2) or type-III (IFN\u03bb) IFN-mediated immune defenses (Figs 5, 6 , and S7), despite infected tissues having abundant levels of intracellular vRNA (Fig 4C) . We posit that the lack of immune induction observed at 40\u02daC is likely a consequence of diminished levels of vRNA replication, which has been shown to play an important role in the production of PAMPs (e.g., dsRNA intermediates) required for the activation of innate immune defenses to other respiratory pathogens [54] [55] [56] [57] . However, PRR detection of PAMPs plays an important role in the induction of a proinflammatory cytokines (including IL-6) required to mount a fever response to microbial challenge in vivo [9, 10] . Thus, additional animal studies will be required to determine whether the temperaturedependent restriction of SARS-CoV-2 occurs independently of an IFN response in vivo. While speculative, we posit that low to moderate grade fever may confer protection to respiratory tissue within SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals as a component of a homeostatically controlled non-hyperinflammatory immune response to infection.",

The heat stress response has been shown to play both a positive (proviral) and negative (antiviral) role during virus replication [58] [59] [60] . Our transcriptomic analysis identified respiratory epithelial host responses to be differentially regulated in response to both temperature elevation and SARS-CoV-2 infection (Figs 5, 6 , and S1-S5). Thus, SARS-CoV-2 infection of respiratory epithelia at elevated temperature elicits a distinct host response that may contribute to the restriction of SARS-CoV-2 replication at multiple stages of infection. For example, we identify lncRNAs to be differentially expressed in response to both SARS-CoV-2 infection and temperature (S5 Fig), which are known to influence the outcome of virus infection independently of IFN-mediated immune defenses [61] . Thus, multiple gene products and/or pathways may contribute to the sequential or accumulative restriction of SARS-CoV-2 replication within respiratory epithelia at elevated temperature.",

            "text": "We identify temperature elevation to correlate with lower levels of SARS-CoV-2 sgRNA expression (Fig 7E) , identifying a temperature-dependent block in SARS-CoV-2 transcription. We hypothesize that this restriction may relate to an inhibition in SARS-CoV-2 RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity and/or binding affinity to vRNA, as the genomic replication activity of the IAV RdRp polymerase is known to be restricted at elevated temperature (41\u02daC) [62] . Notably, avian IAV cold adaptation of RdRp is a host determinant of IAV zoonosis, which naturally replicates in the intestinal tract of birds at higher temperatures [63] . As circulating strains of SARS-CoV-2 are susceptible to nonsynonymous mutation within RdRp coding sequences (http://cov-glue.cvr.gla.ac.uk/#/home), molecular studies are warranted to determine if such amino acid substitutions might influence the thermal restriction of SARS-CoV-2 replication. While SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to replicate to higher viral titers at temperatures associated with the upper respiratory airway (33\u02daC) relative to core body temperature (37\u02daC) [16] , the replication of coronaviruses at febrile body temperatures has remained poorly characterized. While temperature-sensitive (ts) coronavirus mutants have been identified for feline infectious peritonitis virus (tsFIPV) and murine hepatitis virus (MHV tsNC11), their parental wild-type derivatives were able to replicate at temperatures \ufffd39\u02daC [64, 65] . The replication defect for tsFIPV was attributed to a block in viral maturation that limited its replication in cats to the upper respiratory airway [64] , whereas the growth defect in tsNC11 was attributed to a coding mutation within the macrodomain and papain-like protease 2 domain of the nonstructural protein 3 [65] . Thus, we present the first evidence demonstrating a circulating strain of coronavirus to be sensitive to temperature thermoregulation. Genomic analysis of SARS-CoV-2 isolated from apical washes failed to identify any unique SNPs from infected tissues at 40\u02daC relative to input sequence. These data support the temperature-dependent block in SARS-CoV-2 propagation to occur prior to vRNA replication, a prerequisite requirement for genomic mutation. As such, heat adaptation gain of function experiments through serial passage of SARS-CoV-2 at elevated temperature (\ufffd39\u02daC) may shed light on whether the restriction observed is related to viral and/or cellular host factors. Importantly, however, appropriate levels of biosafety (ethical and genetic modification) should be considered prior to such experimentation.",

All samples had a RIN score of \ufffd8.8. AU : PerPLOSstyle; numeralsarenotall Total RNA (220ng) was used to prepare libraries for sequencing using an Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep kit (Illumina, 20020594) and SuperScript II Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen, 18064014) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Dual indexed libraries were PCR amplified, then cleaned up with Agencourt AMPure XP magnetic beads (Beckman Coulter), quantified using Qubit Fluorometer 4 (Life Technologies, Q33238) and Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies Q32854), and the size distribution assessed using a 4200 TapeStation System (Agilent Technologies, G2991A) with a High Sensitivity D1000 Screen Tape assay (Agilent Technologies, 5067-5584). Libraries were pooled in equimolar concentrations and sequenced using an Illumina NextSeq 500/550 sequencer (Illumina, FC-404-2005) . At least 95% of the reads generated presented a Q score of \ufffd30. RNA-Seq reads were quality assessed using FastQC (http:// www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc)). Sequence adaptors removed using TrimGalore (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/)). RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the Homo sapiens genome (GRCh38), downloaded via Ensembl using HISAT2. HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive splice aware mapper, which aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using FM index strategy [68] . FeatureCounts [69] was used to calculate MR counts that were normalized to counts per million (CPM; unless otherwise stated). Generalized linear models (GLMs) with multifactor designs was used for DEG analysis in EdgeR [70] . A false discovery rate (FDR) p-value <0.05 (Q < 0.05) was used as a cutoff of significant differential gene expression. Sequencing reads were aligned to SARS-CoV-2 (Gen-Bank accession MN908947.3) using BWA [71] . Periscope was used to quantify sgRNA expression levels [72] . Values were normalized to ORF1a. Only high-confidence (Q < 0.05) DEGs were used for pathway analysis in Reactome (https://reactome.org) [73, 74] or differential pathway enrichment in Metascape (https://metascape.org/gp/index.html#/main/step1) [75] . In Reactome, the gene mapping tool was used as a filter to identify pathways enriched (overrepresented) for mapped DEG entities. FDR values <0.05 were considered significant for pathway enrichment. In Metascape, all DEGs were used for differential pathway analysis. Pathway p-values <0.05 were considered significant. Differentially expressed lncRNAs (Q < 0.05) were identified using the EnsemblBioMarttool (http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/ 05285d5f063a05a82b8ba71fe18a0f18). Heat maps were plotted in GraphPad Prism (version 9.2.0). Mean CPM values of 0 were normalized to 0.01 for log2 presentation. Venn diagrams were plotted using http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/Venn/.",
