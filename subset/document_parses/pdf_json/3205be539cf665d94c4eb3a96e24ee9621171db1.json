            "text": "Respiratory tract infections are common infectious diseases in clinics. They are highly prevalent in infants, the elderly and immunocompromised patients, often leading to severe symptoms or mortality [1] . According to the WHO, approximately 3 million people died from lower respiratory tract infections in 2016 [2] . Common pathogens of respiratory tract infections include viruses, bacteria, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, and other microorganisms [3] . Viral pathogens mainly include influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), and adenovirus [4] . Bacterial pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis [5] . Most respiratory tract infections have similar clinical symptoms, making their identification difficult for clinicians. Thus, the rapid identification of pathogens of respiratory tract infections is of great significance for accurate clinical diagnosis and the administration of appropriate medication. Over the past few years, the rapid development of molecular detection technology has largely compensated for the shortcomings of traditional culture and immunoassay methodologies used to detect respiratory pathogens, substantially improving the speed, sensitivity, and specificity of the detection and identification of respiratory pathogens. In particular, the development of pathogen detection systems based on multiplex PCR allows the simultaneous detection of many different pathogens for use in clinical applications [6] [7] [8] [9] . Multiplex real-time quantitative fluorescence PCR detection has relatively high sensitivity and specificity but is limited by the number of fluorescence types in each reaction. Generally, only 3-4 pathogens can be detected in one reaction, and if more pathogens need to be detected, more reactions are required, substantially reducing the convenience of detection and throughput. Luminex's NxTAG Respiratory Viral Panel is based on liquid chip technology and can simultaneously detect 20 pathogens, including 18 viruses and subtypes, as well as Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae [10] . However, this commercial kit has not been widely used in clinics due to the high cost of its reagents.",

A negative control, B-E M pneumoniae strain diluted to 10, 100, 1000, and 10,000 copies/\u03bcl, respectively. The arrow on the left side of the spectrum results indicates the position of the extension primer peak, the arrow on the right side indicates the position of the extension product, and the peak at approximate 5235 Da is the non-extended primer of HCoV. When concentrations of the negative control and pathogen were 10 copies/\u03bcl, there was only an extension primer peak and no extension product peak. At plasmid concentrations of 100, 1000, and 10,000 copies/\u03bcl, extension product peaks appeared, and the extension primer peaks became smaller or absent due to consumption. Thus, the detection sensitivity for M. pneumoniae was 100 copies/\u03bcl detection limit of all pathogens was between 10 copies/\u03bcl to 100 copies/\u03bcl (Table 3) .",

It was also found that among the 20 cases of S. pneumoniae infection, there were only 9 (45.0%) cases of single pathogen infection, and among 11 cases of dual and multiple infections, there were five cases of M. catarrhalis co-infection and four of H. influenzae co-infection, which indicated that co-infections between bacteria were relatively common. Furthermore, the antibiotic resistance of these three bacteria is different [26] . Comprehensive and detailed pathogen diagnosis is of great significance in guiding the rational use of antibiotics to avoid the inappropriate prescription of antibiotics. There were 21/207 (10.1%) samples that tested positive for viruses (note: there were two samples co-infected by three viruses). In China, viral infections are highly prevalent in autumn and winter and relatively low in spring and summer [27] . The samples in this study were collected from clinical patients from April to July (during spring and summer), which may be one of the reasons for the low positive rate of viral respiratory tract infections. PIV was detected in ten cases, including two cases of PIV1, three of PIV2, two of PIV3, and three of PIV4. There was no significant difference in the number of subtypes, which was different from the positive detection rates of PIV The MRT-MassARRAY respiratory pathogen detection system established in this study detected 27 respiratory pathogens and showed sensitivity and specificity similar to the results obtained using consensus PCR/RT-PCR. The advantage over real-time PCR is mainly reflected in the multiplicity of nucleic acid mass spectrometry amplification. In this study, a 27-plex one tube amplification mode was used, and the test cost was as low as 15 dollars per sample. MassARRAY detection uses 96/384 chips, with a high throughput of up to 384 samples. Based on this feature, our detection system is highly suited to early clinical pathogen screening and regional respiratory pathogen epidemiological investigations. A potential concern of this detection system is that a SNP could occur at the extension position which will lead to a nonspecific peak arising in the mass window, with its molecular weight not being consistent with the molecular weight in Table 2 . Actually, this is a very rare situation that we had not encountered in this study, in case it happens Sanger sequencing of the PCR product would have to be done to determine the exact pathogen.",

This may be because that Wang et al.'s study population was mainly children, and PIV3 is one of the leading causes of lower respiratory tract infections in infants as well as immunocompromised people[29]. In this study, seven cases (3.38%) of HMPV were detected, which was close to the positive detection rate of HMPV of 3.53% reported in 2018 by Zhong et al. (2019)[30]. We also detected six (2.90%) cases of influenza A virus, all of which were H1N1. Additionally, respiratory syncytial virus was detected in two cases and adenovirus and human coronavirus in one case each. Due to the limited number of samples and sample types, some subtypes of human bocavirus; human enterovirus; influenza B; and influenzae A H3, H3N2 seasonal, H5, and H7 were not detected in this study.",
