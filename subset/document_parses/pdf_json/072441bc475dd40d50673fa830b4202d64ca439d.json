The quantitative data were entered in EpiData version 4.6 and exported to Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) version 25.0 for data cleaning and analysis. The quantitative data on access to WASH facilities was reported using WHO ladder guidelines, which include no access, limited access, and basic access, whereas the qualitative data on challenges to WASH facilities were triangulated with the quantitative result.",

The major problems were the absence of separate latrines for healthcare workers and clients, as well as female and male staffs, an unbalanced number of functional latrines for the number of clients, non-functional latrines, poor cleanliness and misuse of the latrine. Less than a quarter of the HCFs 15 (21.4%) had basic access to handwashing facilities, while half 35 (50%) of the HCFs did not.

The lack of planning may be due to the absence of a separate budget for WASH service at HCFs mainly in LMICs which reported between 0.08 and 2.54% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) invested in WASH. The major sources of funding are official development assistance, foundations and charities, and loans from international sources, which accounted for 12% of total finance in 2016-2018 [42] .",

The possible reason for this variation may be the change in the study period and government commitment towards improving WASH facilities in healthcare settings. WHO recommends people with suspected or confirmed SARS-CoV-2 should be provided a separate toilet, and if not possible, certain toilets should be designated as solely for the shared use of COVID-19 patients and not used by non-COVID-19 patients [20] . In this study, 56% of the HCFs had separate toilets for males and females, which was lower than the study finding in Ethiopia 94.3% [44] . This finding also revealed that 7.1% of HCFs had low cleanliness of the latrine, which may be associated with the absence of a functional lock on the latrine door and lack of lighting, frequency of cleaning, and the behavior of clients in utilizing of latrines. A systematic review conducted in LMIC revealed that the lack of cleanliness of toilets was a bigger problem than the absence of toilets, and that was attributed to a lack of safe and adequate access to water [43] .",

About half of the HCFs had limited access to sanitation facilities. The major problems were the absence of accessible latrines for disabled people, lack of separate latrines for healthcare workers and clients, as well as female and male staff, unbalanced numbers of functional latrines with number of clients, non-functional latrines, and misuse of the latrine mainly during sample taking for laboratory investigation. Less than a quarter of the HCFs had basic access to handwashing facilities at both the point of care and near the latrine.",

            "text": "The major problems were the lack of functional handwashing facilities at the critical points and misuse, particularly around the latrine. Therefore, to reduce the risk of HAIs, including COVID-19, immediate actions should be taken by the concerned governmental and non-governmental organizations to provide sufficient water for all users, disability-friendly sanitation facilities, and handwashing facilities. The issue of WASH should be encouraged in government planning and budgeting. The technical and logistical capabilities of health and safety committees should be strengthened in order to prevent the spread of coronavirus through education and awareness campaigns. Further investigation should be done to assess the enabling factors and constraints for the provision, use, and maintenance of WASH infrastructure at HCFs. ",
