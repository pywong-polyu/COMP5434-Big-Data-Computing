            "text": "Overall, COVID-19 waitlist mortality for pediatric heart transplant decreased by 10% during 2020 versus Pre-COVID mortality rates ( Table 3 ) . Initially, there was a gradual decline in the first four months of 2020, followed by an increase in months four to six, and then subsequently followed by a progressive decline through November ( Fig. 1 ). Regional differences ( Fig. 3 , Table 3 ) that resulted in this finding came primarily from Northeast region (decrease by 7 \u2022 5%) and Midwest region (decrease by 9%). We surmise that contributing factors include a decrease in waitlist additions likely due to delays in non-urgent evaluations along with a decrease in heart failure hospitalizations [2] . This was reflected in our data analyses as well, by comparing waiting list time from Table 1 and Table 2 . Furthermore, decrease in mortality rate in Midwest could be due to more transplant centers being inactivated. However, our study was not designed to look at practice patterns of individual centers. Patients who expired in 2020 remained on the waiting list longer than the average waiting list population for both adult (473 \u2022 97 Table 2 vs. 70 \u2022 17 Table 1 ) and pediatric populations (116 \u2022 83 Table 2 vs. 84 \u2022 65 Table 1 ). We identified differences in mortality outcomes by race, with wait-list mortality for White population decreasing, Black mortality remaining unchanged, and mortality in Hispanics increasing. This could be partly explained by a greater decrease in the number of waitlist additions among Whites as well as severe heart failure (higher level) status in Blacks and Hispanics. The study by DeFilippis [1] looked at centers in New York, NY and found that most of the patients were inactivated on the transplant list except those that had the highest mortality risk, thus limiting active patients to Status 1 and 2 on the new heart allocation policy. Highly-sensitized patients requiring higher acuity of care and prolonged immunosuppression were also restricted. We also identified a higher female mortality rate during this time suggesting that women may have been disproportionally affected. Comparatively, a larger decrease of 15% was seen among adult waitlist mortality. The Northeast and South regions were key drivers for that decrease in adult wait-list mortality. We postulate that since these were the main regions affected early in the pandemic, stringent criteria were set by adult transplant centers to prioritize highly acute transplant patients and hence we see that difference. Restrictions on children and the prevalence of COVID in children was not appreciated in the early days and may have resulted in the comparative increase in the number of waitlist mortality in pediatrics. In adults, both Blacks and Hispanics had an increase in mortality.",

            "text": "The average number of pediatric heart transplants (n = 39 \u2022 3 per month over a 36-month range Pre-COVID) did not change significantly for the year 2020 (n = 39 \u2022 0 per month over an 11-month range). These values are in line with previous findings [14] . However, there was a sharp decrease in transplant volume in the first four months followed by a rapid increase from months four to six, with a return to baseline towards the end of the year. One could attribute the earlier yearly decline to seasonal variation similar to pre-COVID years, although the decline was more marked in 2020 than other years due likely to changes from COVID-19. These changes include concerns regarding COVID-19 positive donors, lack of intensive care unit beds, as well as limitations in the ability to procure organs as a result of personnel limitations and travel restrictions. It appears that May 2020 was the beginning of the re-activation phase ( Fig. 2 ) where programs probably adjusted to the new social distancing norms. This is also when we see an upward trend in the waitlist mortality for pediatrics and to a lesser degree adult. Most institution-specific guidelines started to emerge, as did consensus documents from national and international specialty societies regarding COVID-19 protocols. Strategies to minimize contact between patients and health care workers were developed and resource optimization and prioritization of patients was also instituted. For adults, however, the average number of transplants increased (n = 266 per month during COVID from n = 242 per month pre-COVID). There was an earlier, sharper downward trend but that was short-lasting, and the curve started to rise more steeply than pediatric patients and continued to stay higher for the remainder of the year. This finding is understandable as there are relatively more adults on the waiting list and programs started reactivation after the first quarter with presumptive increase in the number of organ donations due to unexpected deaths as has been reported in earlier COVID related studies [3] .",

            "text": "The data provided help elucidate potential policy guidelines for future pandemics. The transplant community should strive to be proactive and equip ourselves with improved preparation, organized systems and put a systematic process in place for the next pandemic. Considerations for donor offers must include detailed travel history and related exposures, identification of high-risk behaviors of contracting and/or transmitting a lethal and highly contagious infection. Education for not only clinicians, but other transplant team members, and most importantly, patients and their families who may fear reaching out to medical facilities is paramount to handling future pandemics. Decline in heart failure hospitalizations has been reported with COVID-19 as a result of a 'weathering-the-storm' mentality . 1 This obviously adds an enormous burden on the healthcare system when either these patients get sick at home or present to the hospital in a dire clinical state, as they become worse transplant candidates. For a future approach, the transplant community needs to pay particular attention to this and innovate with systems such as telemonitoring, improved accessibility, dedicated intensive care unit beds to house these fragile patients. Immediate post-transplant management may include selecting a core group of nurses, midlevel providers and clinicians that are assigned to only immunosuppressed patients, preventing excessive turnover with infected patients. Limited family and visitor contact also helps reduce spread, and should be put in place from the beginning of any future outbreaks. How we need to adapt and change immunosuppressive and induction treatment continues to be an ongoing discussion, and we will have more information as studies look specifically at transplant recipient immune response to COVID-19 infection as well as response post-vaccination. Even though stable outpatient adult patients on the transplant waiting list may be temporarily inactivated, this option does not always exist for pediatric heart failure patients. The majority of these patients are in-hospital or on mechanical assist devices that have not reached a suitable point for outpatient management. With new devices such as HeartMate III now being approved by the FDA for pediatric use as durable strategy, this may change for a few selected patients, the majority of whom will continue to require higher level in-hospital care [15 , 16] . Legislation and policymaking, both at federal and state level have to be well thought out early in the process. Even though the federal government started applying travel and social distancing restrictions, disparate policies were instituted on a state-by-state basis. While the federal government took steps to recommend providing and receiving care through telehealth, additional steps allowing HIPAA flexibility, modifying Medicare and Medicaid policies, interstate licenses and prescription of controlled substances are necessary [17 , 18] Lastly, as shown in our supplemental data (SI Fig. 1 ), states such as North Dakota, Oklahoma and Hawaii had higher pediatric waitlist mortality, and Iowa, Alabama, Wyoming, Virginia, Arkansas and Vermont had higher adult waitlist mortality. This does not coincide with COVID-19 related mortality rates and does not correlate with the mortality trends in the previous three years. While the underlying cause for this trend is unclear, there are several potential explanations for this observation. One is a decrease in access to healthcare workers. A second is a change in available healthcare resources at the height of COVID-19 due to travel and visitation limitations. A third is healthcare workers travelling to high pandemic areas to provide care resulting in a loss of local resources. Resource limitations for these states could have been further affected by the growing COVID-19 related cases as all resources were diverted to take care of these patients limiting availability for other cases. COVID-19 cases are now on the decline in the United States with widespread vaccination. As the healthcare system returns to normal or adjusts to a new normal, will waiting list mortality return to previous levels? This question will be answered in an ongoing study currently being conducted by our team.",
