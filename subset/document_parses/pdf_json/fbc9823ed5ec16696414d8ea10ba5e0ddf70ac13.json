In radiology (and partly in pathology), the term lobular is used more commonly than acinar , although they are not completely congruent (acini being smaller units than lobes). The pathophysiology of COPD as determined by spirometric function tests is de fi ned by a normal or increased total lung capacity (TLC) and forced vital capacity (FVC) in combination with decreased forced expiratory volume (FEV). COPD follows either increased resistance to air fl ow (e.g., luminal narrowing of air ducts) or the loss of elastic recoil (passive widening of air spaces). The fi gures present gross features of the most common examples of COPD. ( c ) COPD in this patient leads fi nally to bullous emphysema. Asthma bronchiale (AB) is a chronic lung disease with recurrent episodes of air fl ow obstruction caused by various inhaled antigens. The initial response consists of bronchospasm followed by a type I eosinophilic allergic (IgE type) reaction with sustained bronchoconstriction, increased vascular permeability, and secretion of highly viscous mucus. Causes of AB include exogenous allergic stimuli (e.g., pollen, hair, house dust), infectious organisms (e.g., in fl uenza and parain fl uenza virus, rhinovirus), drugs (e.g., nonsteroidal anti-in fl ammatory drugs, aspirin, b -adrenergic antagonists), occupational exposures (e.g., fur exposure by animal handlers, vegetable dusts, metal salts, pharmaceuticals, wood by woodworkers), and reactions induced by stress or exercise (e.g., nonspeci fi c stimulation of sensitized persons by air temperature or dryness) a c b Fig. 3. 2 Chronic exposure to \"nontoxic\" dusts (common air pollution, cigarette smoking, anthracosis) causes chronic bronchitis, emphysema, and COPD. The type of emphysema is usually centriacinar. Note the decreased consistency of the lung, with bulging and sunken-in parts ( a ); focal deposits of dust pigment ( b ); and centriacinar (centrilobular) pronounced emphysema ( c ). The pathogenesis consists of induction of either nonspeci fi c in fl ammation or allergic sensitization (see Fig. 3 .1 ). More extensive panacinar (panlobular) emphysema may develop either in the further course of exposure to these nontoxic dusts or ab initio by loss of alveolar septae in inherited diseases such as a 1 -antitrypsin de fi ciency Interstitial emphysema (right lung), a form of localized emphysema, shows air bubbles resembling a string of pearls in interstitial tissue ( arrows ). It is caused by bronchoalveolar rupture secondary to highpressure arti fi cial respiration. Air may extend into the mediastinum and skin with compression of vessels and air spaces, causing severe respiratory and circulatory problems. Other localized emphysemas, such as paraseptal emphysema, may be caused by deposits of speci fi c toxic substances (e.g., occupational exposure to chromium oxide). Irregular emphysema commonly develops around pulmonary scars of varying etiology a b ( a , b ) . A microscopic overview ( c ) shows severe overproduction of mucus (red parts in glands, double arrow ) as well as bronchiectasis ( single arrows ) and mucous plugging. CF is an autosomal recessive disorder with de fi cient exocrine functions or glands in a number of organs, including the pancreas, liver, lungs, small intestines, and others. The disease results from a genetic defect of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which is responsible for regulating the function of the chloride channel. It most often affects white children, with an incidence of about 1 in 2,500 births. Pathologically, CF is responsible for chronic bronchiolitis and bronchitis with severe mucous plugging and bronchial cyst formation. Chronic pancreatitis and secondary biliary cirrhosis are among other complications a b Fig. 3 .10 Similar bronchiectases and COPD may be caused by a hereditary de fi ciency of a 1 -antitrypsin, a circulating glycoprotein produced in the liver and responsible for inhibiting proteases including trypsin, chymotrypsin, elastase, thrombin, and various bacterial proteases. Note bullous emphysema and focal interstitial fi brosis ( a ), as well as striking bronchiectasis and mucoid metaplasia of the bronchial epithelium ( b ). a 1 -Antitrypsin de fi ciency in the lung decreases the inhibition of neutrophil elastase and thus will cause emphysema.

ARDS is the clinical term for diffuse alveolar damage (DAD) resulting from alveolar epithelial and endothelial damage of various etiologies.

Bacterial pneumonias (bronchogenic or hematogenous) commonly are suppurative, abscessing, necrotizing, or hemorrhagic. Viral pneumonias (through immune T-cell stimulation) are preferentially lymphocytic and, in severe cases, are necrotizing and hemorrhagic (e.g., classic in fl uenza). Fungal infections in the lung stimulate macrophages and frequently cause granulomas (also an immune T-cell reaction); depending on their toxicity, they may cause additional necroses and vascular invasion with thromboses. Parasitic infestations and mycobacterial infections also stimulate phagocytosis and may cause granulomas. Only acute pneumonias without signi fi cant tissue necrosis can show complete resolution and healing. Longerlasting or chronic pneumonitides will resolve incompletely with residual scarring. Chronic, persistent infections consequently also present a risk of the development of chronic restrictive lung diseases. Several newer classi fi cation schemes for the stages of tuberculosis (TB) are available. The classic scheme is presented here in order to consider the three main factors determining the course and outcome of the disease: the toxicity of the mycobacterium, the reactivity of the infected, and the time after initial infection. The degree of immune reactivity (not resistance to disease) may be monitored by tuberculin skin testing; the toxicity of tubercle bacteria is partly determined by the \"cord factor\" a b Characteristically, all granulomas are of the same size (i.e., the same age), indicating that they developed within a short time window. This typically happens in late primary TB with nearly normal immune sensitivity, when mycobacteria disseminate hematogenously.

This mechanism signi fi cantly distinguishes miliary TB from the more common hematogenous TB with a still-active primary site. In this case, tuberculous granulomas develop immediately as bacteria settle in various tissues, so the granulomas are of different sizes and ages. Miliary TB may even develop in patients not known to have had TB (with a clinically occult focus and \"normal\" immune sensitivity) a b Fig. 3.36 ( a , b ) Axial CT scans of a right upper lobe cavitary tuberculosis.

Goodpasture's syndrome is a systemic vasculitis ( see Table 1 ( a -d ) Four axial CT images of the chest with contrast, following the pulmonary embolus protocol, in a patient with acute saddle pulmonary embolus. The embolus straddles the bifurcation of the pulmonary trunk into the right and left pulmonary arteries and also extends into the lower lobe lobar and segmental pulmonary arteries. The embolus is the dark fi lling defect in the pulmonary artery, which is otherwise opaci fi ed (white) because of the iodinated contrast given intravenously for this study. Most often, the pulmonary embolus is nonocclusive Fig. 3.62 Posterior chest radiograph of a 17-year-old boy with proven Goodpasture's syndrome who presented to the hospital with hemoptysis. He improved without treatment, but the disease recurred months later a b Fig. 3 .63 Pulmonary arterial hypertension. A posteroanterior chest radiograph ( a ) and axial CT scan with intravenous contrast ( b ) show a markedly enlarged pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary arteries that taper abruptly in the periphery. On the CT image, the pulmonary trunk should measure approximately the same as the ascending aorta, which sits adjacent to it. In this case, the pulmonary trunk is easily 3.5 times larger than the ascending aorta. To make the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), there must be enlargement of the pulmonary trunk and right and left pulmonary arteries with peripheral tapering of the vessels. If the pulmonary trunk and the right and left pulmonary arteries are enlarged but the peripheral vessels are not tapered but rather enlarge, then the image would be indicative of rightto-left shunt. Other clues on CT scans pointing to a diagnosis of PAH include evidence of right heart failure, such as contrast leaving the heart into the intrahepatic veins and inferior vena cava, indicating elevated right heart pressure, or convexity of the interventricular septum. Normally, the interventricular septum is straight or bowed toward the right ventricle during ventricular systole (interventricular septum is convex toward the lower pressure of the right ventricle). With PAH, the septum may be deviated toward the left ventricle, again a sign of elevated right heart pressure Fig. 3 .64 Shock lung. Shock is a microcirculatory and metabolic disturbance resulting in inadequate perfusion of vital organs (lungs, kidneys, heart, liver, adrenals, and others). It may be caused by various mechanisms: cardiogenic, hypovolemic, septic, traumatic, toxic, or allergic. Microvascular hypoxic or toxic damage to the endothelium initiates a cascade activation of cytokines (e.g., tumor necrosis factor, interleukin [IL]-1 and IL-6, platelet activation factor), which add to the local damage with hypoperfusion, stasis, and thrombosis. Shock is always a systemic reaction leading to multiple organ disease (i.e., multiple organ dysfunction syndrome). Various forms of acute and chronic in fl ammation develop, depending on the chronicity of the disturbance and the length of survival of the patient. Shock lung (compare ARDS and DAD) is characterized by diffuse, \"cloudy\" pulmonary in fi ltrate on radiography ( a ). Grossly, the lungs are pale (unless congested), voluminous, and of a \"jellylike\" consistency, with a humid cut surface ( b ).

Fungal pneumonia frequently shows a combination of acute (exudative) and chronic (granulomatous) reactions.

Similarly, for several forms of IPF ( fi brosing alveolitis), autoimmune mechanisms are considered to be contributory in their pathogenesis or course. In addition, collagen vascular diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), primary systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), and rheumatoid arthritis frequently involve the lungs. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis may show features of silicosis (Caplan's syndrome), and several forms of systemic vasculitides also affect the lungs, including Goodpasture's syndrome, Wegener's pneumogenic granulomatosis, and Churg-Strauss disease. Although gross features of these disorders are usually nonspeci fi c, the fi gures show a few examples as a reminder for the differential diagnosis. All are thought to have an autoimmune pathogenesis, although the etiology remains obscure. Many of these diseases have genetic traits. (See also the fi gures on asthma and IPF under Sect. \" Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Diseases .\")Fig. 3.49Systemic lupus erythematosus. SLE belongs to the group of collagen vascular diseases, together with rheumatoid arthritis, progressive systemic sclerosis (scleroderma), polymyositis and dermatomyositis, mixed connective tissue disease, and Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome. Their clinical fi ndings and pathology need to be distinguished from those of other idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, as previously discussed. Shown here is an example of SLE with grossly pale, fl eshy lungs ( a , b ), pleural fi brosis, and diffusely increased fi rmness. Pulmonary disease commonly starts as acute alveolitis with edema and variable interstitial in fl ammation (e.g., nonspeci fi c interstitial pneumonia[NSIP]) and may be complicated by focal hemorrhage. Later microscopy is variable, with pleural and focal interstitial fi brosis ( c ), occasional vasculitis, and frequent infections.

Carcinoma of the lung is among the most common causes of cancer death in the world. Its etiology includes chemical carcinogenesis (e.g., smoking, air pollution, occupational chemical exposure) and viral carcinogenesis (e.g., papillomavirus, adenovirus). For immediate clinical and therapeutic purposes, lung carcinoma is subdivided into small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). Pathohistologically, one distinguishes SCC from adenocarcinoma, SCLC, large cell undifferentiated carcinoma (LCUC), and salivary gland-type tumors. Some have endocrine activities, and others are overt neuroendocrine tumors. These gross pictures show an example of SCC of the bronchus ( a ), with paratracheal and mediastinal lymph node metastases ( b ).

Bronchogenic tumors currently are classi fi ed histologically and for treatment purposes into two major categories: SCLC and NSCLC. These tumors are staged, and if staging indicates, the patient is eligible for curative surgery. SCLC is presumed to be metastatic at the time of diagnosis, and these patients have chemotherapy rather than surgery for their treatment a b Fig. 3.70 Alveolar cell carcinoma. Alveolar cell carcinoma (bronchioloalveolar carcinoma [BAC]) appears to be a special subtype of pulmonary adenocarcinoma.

The lung (like the gastrointestinal tract, skin, and central nervous system) is a common site for the development of extranodal malignant lymphomas in adults. Many primary pulmonary lymphomas are of B-cell lineage and are derived from mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue. Others are large cell lymphomas (B-cell or anaplastic T-cell type), primary plasmacytomas, or, more rarely, angiocentric lymphomas and Castleman's disease ( see also Chap. 8 ).

Lipid or lipoid pneumonia results from enhanced accumulation of exogenous or endogenous lipids in terminal air spaces.

Exogenous lipid pneumonia occasionally has also been found after infusion of nutritive fl uids with a high lipid content. Endogenous lipid pneumonia, a rare condition, arises from the slow degeneration of cells under low oxygen pressure (e.g., slow degeneration of macrophages and neutrophils with breakdown of lipid-containing cellular membranes [fat phanerosis]).
