We further performed alternative analyses in which viral detection was defined as Ct\u226430, symptom severity was defined as a minimum threshold below which symptoms were excluded from contributing toward criteria, and COVID-19 symptoms were defined by WHO criteria. [6] WHO criteria were fever and dry cough; or loss of taste or smell; or at least three of the following: fever, dry cough, fatigue, headache, muscle aches, sore throat, coryza (nasal congestion, runny nose, or sneezing), shortness of breath, nausea or vomiting, or diarrhea. Two-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were produced using generalized estimating equations with clustering by participant.
