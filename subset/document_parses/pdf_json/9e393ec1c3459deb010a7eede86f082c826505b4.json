The same 2 studies showed a mean 0.5-1.3 points decrease in NRS in the group treated with nonoperative treatment. We assume our trial's case group to have at least mean 3 points decrease in NRS and the control group to experience a mean 1 point decrease in NRS. 2 previous studies have suggested that 2 points' reduction in NRS represents a clinical important difference (30, 31) . For the sample size calculation, we assumed a change that would result in a mean 2-point difference between the groups for the main outcome in NRS on the operated side 6 months postoperatively. The standard deviation (SD) was set to 2.5 points because the SD has been reported in previous studies to vary between 1.0 and 2.9 at 6 months' follow-up after SIJ fusion (22, (27) (28) (29) . The probability of a type 1 error (alpha) was set to 0.05. Based on these assumptions we calculate 25 participants in each group with 80% power using an online sample size calculator (www.clincalc.com).

In order to evaluate hypotheses of variables in contingency tables, the chi-square test will be used or, in the case of small expected frequencies, Fisher's exact test. In addition to this, descriptive statistics will be used to characterize the data. A p-value of < 0.05 will be considered as significant. A sensitivity analysis will be performed comparing the intention to treat data against the per-protocol data exclusively from patients who complied with the study protocol. All statistical analysis will be performed by a blinded statistician. The code for group belonging will not be broken until the analyses and interpretations of the results have been performed.",

A placebo effect after surgery has been shown to be an important factor in efficacy (37) . Both patient and health care provider can influence a placebo effect on treatment results. This has particularly been shown in treatment of chronic pain, where the psychological component is believed to be important. Patients with long-lasting diseases seem to be poorer placebo responders, but on the other hand placebos tend to work better in patients expecting to have changes in sensation of pain (38) . Several sham controlled studies in orthopedic surgery have shown comparable pain relief in both groups, such as Moseley et al. (39) and Schr\u00f8der et al. (40) . Hence, the effect of MIS SIJ fusion might be explained by placebo, but this is yet to be examined.",

However, a German study of 1.37 million anaesthetic procedures with elective patients, graded as ASA classification physical status I and II, showed 7.3 cases of death or serious complication per million cases, corresponding to a very low risk (41) . All types of surgery are associated with risks of complications, and so also for MIS SIJ (42) . In the control group the risks for surgical complications should be very low. A possible result showing sham surgery to be equal to SIJ fusion might spare thousands of people from undergoing unnecessary elective surgery with the risk and costs such surgery entail. We therefore find it ethically acceptable to complete a sham-controlled double-blinded randomized prospective study.",
