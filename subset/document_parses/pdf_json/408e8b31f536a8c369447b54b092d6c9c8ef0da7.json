In healthcare, particularly cardiology, early and accurate detection of cardiac disease is critical. The Heart Disease Data Set-UCI repository collects data on heart disease. The search space and complexity of the classification models are increased by this raw dataset, which contains redundant and inconsistent data. We need to eliminate the redundant and unnecessary elements from the data to improve classification accuracy. As a consequence, feature selection approaches might be useful for reducing the cost of diagnosis by identifying the most important qualities. This research developed an ensemble classification model based on a feature selection approach in which selected features play a role in classification. Accordingly, a classification approach was introduced using ensemble learning with a genetic algorithm, feature selection, and biomedical test values to diagnose heart disease. Based on the results, it is deduced that the benefits of using the feature selection method vary depending on the utilized machine learning technique. However, the best-proposed model based on the combination of genetic algorithm and the ensemble learning model has achieved an accuracy of 97.57% on the considered datasets. The suggested diagnosis system achieved better accuracy than previously proposed methods and can easily be implemented in healthcare to identify heart disease.",

We now describe the datasets we chose, the algorithms used, and the experimental methodology. They have been used for different research purposes in recent years. Such datasets may contain thousands of instances (records), each represented by hundreds or thousands of features (attributes or variables). The large datasets have many features, including valuable data for understanding information and many inappropriate and related features. This decreases learning achievement and computational performance. So, a preprocessing step named \"feature selection\" is used to reduce the dimensions before using any information extraction techniques such as classification, related rules, clustering, and regression [49] . A feature selection technique was proposed to pick a subset of relevant and non-redundant features in this study to overcome these problems. To this end, the genetic algorithm and the Relief and FCBF are employed to pick the valuable features in the rapid diagnosis of heart diseases. Our work attempts to predict diagnosis efficiently with a reduced num- Fig. 3 The structure of feature selection ber of features (i.e., attributes) that contribute more towards cardiac disease detection using the feature selection technique.

Feature extraction has two main goals: to decrease the number of attributes and improve the classification efficiency due to its inherent nature [50] . We used the ReliefF with the Ranker search method to attribute features in the first step. We left the method's parameters as the default, which compares every instance with its five nearest neighbors. The highest features with Reli-efF were thal, sex, and CP, with 0.0821, 0.0793, and 0.0790. Age, slope, depression, and Ca had significantly lower scores than other features: 0.0188, 0.0157, 0.0118, and 0.0114. We removed these four features and saved the remaining nine into a dataset referred to as the Heart-2 dataset. Also, we used the FCBF attribute evaluator with the Ranker search method. The most significant features according to FCBF were cp, heart rate, and thal with scores of 0.1728, 0.1701, and 0.1598. This time, the lowest-ranked features were age, slope, depression, and Ca, with 0.0341, 0.0228, 0.0116, and 0.0088. We removed these four features and selected the remaining nine features to create a dataset that we will refer to as the Heart-2 dataset. Table 6 as represented above, filter strategies perform the feature choice method as a preprocessing step with no induction algorithm. The general characteristics of the coaching information are accustomed to choosing options. The results obtained for the four filters studied (relief, FCBF, and ND) are compared and mentioned. The ultimate aim of this study is to pick out a filter to construct a hybrid technique for feature selection. The following step was to seek out the simplest feature subset using GA-supported seven different classifiers in the Heart-2 dataset. Clear and intuitive clinical interpretation is required to help clinicians in the higher cognitive processes; thus, GA was chosen for its ability to explore the full-feature space and convey the simplest feature subset. SVM, NB, Dtree, MLP, KNN, RFC, and LR were classifiers for the GA. Each classifier selected 7-9 features using the GA. This feature set is employed in our recognition system and its clas-sification results.

However, this method also has disadvantages, including that the unwanted desired subset may be removed from a subset. In general, the biggest distinction between the filtering and wrapper strategies is that the primary one involves a non-repetitive calculation within the information; the latter will adapt itself to machine learning algorithms and be used. It can be concluded that the wrapper results will be better than the filtering method, but the computational cost of this method is high [51] [52] [53] [54] .",

Diagnosis of detection heart disease was compared in rates among various algorithms the accuracy based on evolutionary algorithms. The accuracy of the model predictions showed that ensemble learning based on a genetic algorithm had the best performance and could lead to 97.57% accuracy, 96% sensitivity, and 97% specific. Figure 10 shows the accuracy of the eight classification models when applied to the dataset. Many of the models built on the Heart-2 dataset were performed high. However, the classification model built against these features set using the proposed method achieved the highest recall of any model and had the highest accuracy of any model applied. So experimental results procured for the heart-2 dataset show that the proposed method outperformed the other algorithms in terms of all metrics. We believe that our heart prediction framework will assist doctors in predicting hearts with high accuracy.",
