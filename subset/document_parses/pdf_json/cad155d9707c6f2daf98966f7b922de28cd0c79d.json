            "text": "Background: Community testing for HIV can reach previously untested populations but is rarely offered in workplaces. Targeting the construction sector could reach workers from high risk populations. Methods: The RE-AIM framework was used to evaluate Test@Work, a workplace HIV testing intervention for construction workers implemented at 21 events (10 companies) in the UK. Test@Work had three components: 1) an online health toolkit to inform managers about health screening and HIV testing; 2) general health checks; and 3) opt-in HIV consultation and testing. Quantitative data were collected using registration and exit questionnaires with workers (n = 426) and pre/post-event questionnaires with managers (n = 15), with qualitative analysis of free text responses. Results: Reach 426 individuals had health checks. Participants were broadly representative of the UK construction workforce, but with a higher proportion of permanent workers. Most workers reported being in good health but also believed their work had an adverse impact on their health. Effectiveness: 97% of health check participants opted to have a consultation about sexual health (n = 413) and 82% had an HIV test (n = 348), of whom 78% had not previously been tested. All HIV tests were non-reactive. HIV testing at work was considered acceptable by most participants. Participants reported learning new things about their health (74%), said they would make changes as a result (70%) and felt confident of success (median score 8/10). Adoption: Recruitment of companies was challenging and time consuming. Seven of the participating companies were very large, employing over 1000 workers, which is atypical of construction generally. Implementation: All events were completed as planned and were considered successful by all parties. Maintenance: All managers would arrange further events if they were offered them. Six managers incorporated sexual health awareness into their health programmes, but this was not possible for many as health agendas were set centrally by their organisations. Conclusions: Opt-in HIV testing, when embedded within a general health check, has high uptake and acceptability in the UK construction sector, and reaches individuals at risk for HIV who may not otherwise attend for testing. Cost-effectiveness of this approach is yet to be determined. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04292002.",

            "text": "The last twenty years have seen substantial developments in the treatment and prevention of HIV. Worldwide, 26 million people are receiving lifelong ART (antiretroviral therapy) and the rate of new infections is falling in many countries. Within the United Kingdom (UK), 97% of those who have been diagnosed with the illness are receiving treatment. Viral suppression has been achieved in 97% of those being treated so that they are no longer considered infectious and their life expectancy and quality of life are close to normal [1] . There have also been substantial improvements in diagnosis rates, particularly for men who have sex with men (MSM). However, an estimated 19% of those living with the disease worldwide do not know their HIV status. Within the UK, there remain an estimated 7500 undiagnosed cases and 43% of cases are diagnosed late, resulting in higher mortality and an ongoing risk of transmission to others. Late diagnosis is more common amongst men who are heterosexual and older [2, 3] . Additionally, both HIV prevalence and late diagnosis in the UK are higher amongst those with black ethnicity and those born in countries with a high prevalence [4] . More than 50% of infections are acquired post-migration for these populations [5, 6] highlighting the need for ongoing education and effective testing programmes.",

Advances in recent years to support this have included self-sampling and self-testing kits, shown to have high sensitivity and specificity, high effectiveness (particularly amongst black and Asian men in the UK) and good acceptability [3, 7, 8] . There have also been developments in the variety of settings which are used for testing. For example, primary health care settings such as general practices (GP) in high prevalence areas are encouraged to test routinely; sexual health clinics are advised to test those who attend for other services, as often as every three months for those at greatest risk [1] . Community-based testing has been introduced in many countries, often targeting high risk populations e.g., through stalls at Gay Pride events, bars and saunas, also in outreach clinics away from main health care centres [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . These events are typically more expensive and report lower rates of positive results than more traditional testing routes but have successfully identified cases which may have been missed through normal channels.",

Programmes to test, educate and address HIV-related stigma are reported, for example in South Africa [14] , Uganda [15] Zambia [16] and Zimbabwe [17] . These studies have focused particularly in sectors with male dominated populations and a high proportion of migrant workers, such as construction and security. Such programmes are challenging; considerable efforts are needed to address difficulties such as the stigma associated with a positive diagnosis, fear of compromised confidentiality and low perceived HIV risk [18, 19] . Yet, workplace interventions have shown to be an important route for testing in populations with high HIV prevalence [17, 20] , risky lifestyle behaviours and low access to health care [19, 21, 22] . Worksite HIV testing programmes have demonstrated the particular importance of accessibility and convenience for HIV testing with these hard-to-reach populations [17] .",

This presents opportunities to detect undiagnosed cases amongst people who might not access testing through other routes. For example, in the UK (like elsewhere) construction work employs many workers from migrant populations [27] , as well as transient or travelling workers, living too far from their homes to be able to commute on a daily basis [28] [29] [30] . Living away from home increases the likelihood of risky sexual behaviours [21, 22, 31] . Other factors associated with HIV transmission are drug use and high alcohol intake [21] , both common in the construction workforce in many countries, including the UK [30, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] .",

Smoking [37, 38] , obesity [38] [39] [40] , and poor mental health [41] [42] [43] are prevalent in the sector. For example, during the construction of the Olympic Park for London 2012, 41% of the workforce were found to be overweight, 28% were obese and 30% had high blood pressure [44] . These health risks, influenced by socioeconomic factors [40, [45] [46] [47] , add to harm from specific workplace hazards such as noise, vibration, silica dust and hazardous chemicals [48] . As a result, construction workers are at increased risk of early disability or death compared with other populations, with high prevalence of cardiovascular disease, respiratory ill-health and musculoskeletal conditions [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . Beyond individual health impacts, there are financial consequences for workers, since pension changes require them to continue in employment until aged 67 years and beyond [56, 57] . There are substantial costs for construction employers [58] and the premature loss of workers contributes to the growing skill shortages in the UK construction sector [59] . Supportive interventions to help address these factors are therefore important for individual workers and the wider construction community.",

Adoption examines whether organisations which participate have similar characteristics to those which do not, and what the barriers might be to adoption.

Seropositivity for HIV testing is 0.4% in UK community settings overall (with most testing targeting high risk groups such as MSM) [1] , and has been reported at 0.2% in a cohort of new GP registrants [84] . The likelihood of case finding could be increased by targeting potentially higher risk construction populations, such as workers living in London or working on major projects. London construction projects employ four times as many European migrant workers and more than twice as many non-EU migrant workers compared to UK construction overall [27] , with similar variations in ethnicity. During construction of the Olympic park for London 2012 for example, 24% of the workforce were of BAME ethnicity, compared to 7% of the UK construction workforce at that time [85] . Additionally, London based projects and mega projects are more likely to employ workers who are living away from their families [29, 86] , with the associated risk behaviours reported in these populations [30, 87] . The combination of high uptake of testing (as achieved in this study) with likelihood of higher prevalence of HIV would make this a valuable approach to identifying undiagnosed cases of HIV. Regular testing (e.g. every three years) has been identified as both desirable and cost effective even where incidence is as low as 0.01% pa [88] , and annual testing is likely to be cost effective once prevalence reaches 0.8% [89] .",

Workers received a series of text messages promoting sexual health and HIV testing (as well as other areas of health) over a 10-week period, with subsequent textbased evaluation of the intervention. A small number of respondents reported having taken a further HIV test after the event.

Individual sites can then follow this up by liaising with local testing providers through the healthcare services. Signposting to selftesting services might also be helpful in some circumstances [91] . As with onsite testing initiatives, educational interventions would be particularly valuable if they targeted those workplaces with a higher potential HIV prevalence. However, those who are most at risk of HIV might be the least likely to seek testing due to fear of negative consequences or stigma, particularly if there are concerns about being able to keep the diagnosis confidential at work.

This is recommended in the literature as a way of normalising HIV testing and reducing stigma [15, 60, 92, 93] -the high uptake of testing in this study supports this approach. The study also illustrated the direct benefits of offering these wider health checks. They were highly valued by workers who participated and managers who hosted them, with high levels of interest expressed towards arranging further events. Encouragingly, our data show that many workers planned to make lifestyle changes to improve their health and felt confident that they would be able to do so. This is important given the recognised poor health of the construction workforce [40, 46, 49] , and the 'anti-health promoting' nature of the construction industry [94] . Although there are national health programmes which have a similar scope to the general health checks offered in our study, their uptake is often limited. For example, the UK National Health Service (NHS) health check is offered to those aged between 40 and 75 in the UK [95] but uptake is only just over 50% [96] ; and uptake is lower amongst men and those at the younger end of the target range [97, 98] .

It is an industry which is highly fragmented, with extensive subcontracting, high levels of self-employment, and an excessive focus on cost [100] . In the current study, the majority of participating companies were extremely large and self-employed workers were underrepresented, only 26% of those seen were self-employed compared to 40% in the wider construction population. This mirrors the findings of Hanna et al. [94] , that health promotion in construction is more likely to occur with large employers and those with greater numbers of directly employed workers, as others are unlikely to be able to see sufficient benefit to offset the costs.",

There was evidence of this in the current research, with participants making comments about the difficulties of healthy eating and exercise due to the constraints of work demands. Additionally, over 80% of participants considered that work had a direct adverse impact on their health. The most frequent conditions mentioned were musculoskeletal disorders and stress/mental health issues, which are the most prevalent work-related health problems reported in UK construction [108] . Any approach to improve worker health needs to take this context into account. For example, the Test@Work online toolkit [66] used successfully in this research to inform managers about the value of HIV testing could be developed further to highlight to employers the importance of structural measures to improve the health of their workforce, alongside measures that individuals might take themselves.",

However, some participants raised issues which were broader than this. For example, when asked what additional health checks would be valued, some mentioned tests of lung function, hearing or hand arm vibration syndrome. These are examples of health surveillance, which are a legal requirement for those who are exposed to particular work hazards. Although the number that specifically mentioned this was small, the fact that more than half of participants confirmed they had never had a workplace health check confirms the limited access to Occupational Health (OH) services in this population. This is a known challenge. Across the UK, only 14-18% of the workforce have access to OH services [109, 110] . The proportion is typically even lower in construction, despite the higher health risks, due to the way the sector is configured and costed and the high proportion of SMEs [111, 112] . General health checks to support lifestyle changes, and occupational health provision to address work related conditions are both important. It is important that employers and workers understand the difference, and recognise that one is not a substitute for the other. Again, this could be highlighted in revised versions of the online toolkit.",
