Contextual factors, in the same way as individual factors, have been divided into three major components, that is, factors that predispose (eg, proportion of 80+ in the total population), enable (eg, supply of social and healthcare facilities), or approximate individual need for healthcare (eg, disability rate). 7 In this study, we explored whether considering contextual factors in addition to individual factors can improve our understanding of ED visits among older adults.",

            "text": "Individual factors such as age, gender and health problems could potentially explain ED visits. There are mixed findings on the association between old age and ED visits, [8] [9] [10] possibly due to inconsistent methodology. There are higher odds of ED revisits among men. 8 11 Primary and social care play an important role in managing chronic diseases and in the proactive treatment of health problems that might require an ED visit. 2 However, research has shown that home help receipt and greater use of primary care are associated with ED revisits and unplanned hospitalisations. 11 12 While it is logical that greater need for care should be associated with greater use of services, service use does not necessarily ensure that care needs are met. 13 Low staff competence and poor continuity of care entails a risk of unmet needs 14 and may lead to avoidable ED visits. In Sweden, the proportion of registered nurses in municipal social care for older adults is lower than in neighbouring Norway (9% vs 31%), 15 while currently a person receiving home help meets an average of 16 different carers during a 14-day period. 3 Research investigating use of healthcare services among older adults has usually included a measure of home help receipt per se, rather than measuring its level (instrumental services, personal care or both) and quality . 11 12 16 Contextual factors related to healthcare use include community characteristics such as the population age distribution, geographical location and the organisation of health and social care. 7 In Sweden, health and social care is financed, managed and provided by 21 regions and 290 municipalities, with local variations in the management and delivery of care services. For example, without national guidelines on eligibility, municipalities decide on eligibility criteria for home help and residential care services. 17 This challenges the idea that all citizens in a universal welfare state should have equitable access to high quality care services driven by their need rather than, for example, place of residence. 18 19 Health and social care systems internationally have undergone substantial changes. For example, Sweden has the lowest per capita hospital bed rate in Europe, 20 contributing to shorter lengths of hospital stay and an increased need of primary care, while there has been a 30% reduction in residential care since 2000. 17 A growing proportion of older adults are thus ageing at home and the availability of home help services is key to their living independently. 21 However, home help provision has not compensated for the decrease in residential care. 22 Instead, there has been an increase in informal care, particularly for older adults with lower education, while those with higher education are more likely to buy private services. 18 It is important to explore contextual factors potentially influencing ED use among older adults. Or and Penneau found that shorter distance to the ED and unavailability of primary care are associated with ED visits. 23 Studies on social care supply for older adults have shown that higher social care expenditures and greater availability of residential care are negatively associated with ED revisits. 21 24 However, there are few studies on the association between home help coverage and ED visits. 21 In summary, while both individual and contextual factors have the potential to explain ED care use in older adults, research has primarily focused on individual factors. Moreover, few studies on ED visits and revisits have considered the level and quality of home help receipt.",

Grunier et al argued that social and primary care can play a role in the management of need and can contribute Open access positively to reducing ED visits. Our study shows that the addition of home help and healthcare variables increased the variance explained in DVs by demographics and health characteristics and improved the overall model fit. Positive associations between initial ED visit and both home help receipt and primary care visits suggest that the provided services do not meet the recipient's care needs, 2 that is, indicate a poorly functioning health and social care system. However, extensive home help provision is also an indication of poor health/functional status with an increased risk for ED visits. The needs of older adults are often complex, and inadequate care co-ordination between hospitals, primary and municipal social care for older adults increases the risk of negative health outcomes. In Sweden, as in other high-income countries, the fragmentation of health and social care systems has become more visible during the COVID-19 pandemic, and there is a need to establish channels that ensure continuous and rapid coordination of services from different care providers and levels of organisations. 32 33 Research has shown that integrated care, that is, co-ordination between different care providers, can reduce ED visits, hospital admissions, and the length of hospital stay. 34 35 The ED visit models explain more variance in the outcome than the revisit model and more IVs are significant in the model, including contextual factors. This may be partly explained by the revisit models having less variation in its DV, and perhaps also due to ED revisits more than initial ED visit being related to extraneous variables that were not available in the registers accessed and thus not included in the models. The odds of revisits were higher in those who were not admitted to inpatient hospital care at initial visit and among those with greater use of home help services and higher number of hospital admissions. With shorter lengths of hospital Note: The negative bivariate association for proportion of 80+ in the population with initial ED visit becomes a positive association and increases in magnitude in the multivariable model, indicating negative suppression. Through trial variable removal from the model, 30 it was determined that distance to the ED and median days in residential care both acted as suppressor variables for proportion 80+ in the population. *Significant on values estimated from 95% CI.

Critical events that require ED care are common in the 80+ group due to multiple health problems, complex needs and rapid changes in health status, which put pressure on the local healthcare system and this may explain the association between a higher proportion of 80+ in the population and ED visits. The association between distance to the ED and ED visits raises concern on the appropriateness of such visits. Access to ED care should be driven by need rather than place of residence, and the variance in initial ED visit explained by contextual factors challenges the idea of universalism and equitable access to healthcare. This suggests that considering the healthcare needs of the local population and geographical variation in healthcare planning may improve the accessibility of primary and social care for older adults. 23 Implications Those individuals who receive both instrumental services and personal care constitute a vulnerable group that should be considered in interventions for reducing ED visits, discharge planning, and aftercare.

Home help receipt was categorised as an individual factor, while home help quality was categorised as a contextual variable as the individual-level data were only available for analysis as aggregated data. Thus, some variables that might explain ED visits or revisits can be optionally conceptualised and operationalised at individual or contextual levels. An association between variables can differ in strength and direction when analysed at individual vs group level, so it is important that the use of aggregated data as a contextual factor can be defended.

Greater use of home help and primary care does not ensure that needs are met, and further research on the impact of unmet care needs in older adults on ED visits can clarify how the use of different health and social care services are associated. Local variations in home help receipt and utilisation of ED care challenge the notion of a universal welfare state, and require consideration in order to improve health-related outcomes among older adults.
