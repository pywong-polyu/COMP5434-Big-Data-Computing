Immunization from the anticipated vaccines will not be the stand-alone guideline that will help surpass the pandemic and return to normalcy. Four pillars of effective public health intervention include diagnostic testing for both asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals, contact tracing, quarantine of individuals with symptoms or who are exposed to COVID-19, and maintaining strict hygiene standards at the individual and community level. Digital technology, currently being used for COVID-19 testing include certain mobile apps, web dashboards, and online self-assessment tools. Herein, we look into various digital solutions adapted by communities across universities, businesses, and other organizations. We summarize the challenges experienced using these tools in terms of quality of information, privacy, and user-centric issues. Despite numerous digital solutions available and being developed, many vary in terms of information being shared in terms of both quality and quantity, which can be overwhelming to the users. Understanding the testing landscape through a digital lens will give a clear insight into the multiple challenges that we face including data privacy, cost, and miscommunication. It is the destiny of digitalization to navigate testing for COVID-19. Block-chain based systems can be used for privacy preservation and ensuring ownership of the data to remain with the user. Another solution involves having digital health passports with relevant and correct information. In this early draft, we summarize the challenges and propose possible solutions to address the same.",

With the vaccines still undergoing final approvals, the mainstay of pandemic management depends on key public health intervention including early detection, mitigation through isolation and contact tracing. Countries across the world are taking strict measures to manage the overwhelming and unprecedented impact of the pandemic Digital health technology, the mainstay of pandemic strategy can achieve superior outcomes that are difficult to achieve otherwise. Integrating these digital tools into public health interventions has revolutionized surveillance, testing, contact tracing, healthcare access and quarantine measures aimed at control and mitigating COVID-19 spread thereby aiming to reduce COVID-19 infection and deaths Big data and artificial intelligence (AI), used widely in healthcare, have also helped in tracking people and thereby reducing the spread of infection. Migration maps including mobile phones, mobile payment applications and social media are used to collect real-time data on the location of people. Machine learning and disease spread models were developed to predict the regional transmission of the virus that help guide policy and containment measures. Efficient use of big data has contributed to reduced spread and early detection, thereby saving thousands of lives. The need to track the spread of COVID-19 has fuelled the innovation of data containing dashboards that display variables such as disease burden including number of cases, deaths, recovered, and active patients.s. Some dashboards could plot trends according to demographic and geographical characteristics. The limitations of AI need to be addressed and requires training with COVID-19 datasets. The accuracy, validity and reliability of these digital tools are a concern. This viewpoint provides an outline for the application of digital technology in the landscape of pandemic management and response. Also, highlighting the challenges and success of various digital technologies used by countries to manage the pandemic.",

            "text": "Since December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to an exponential growth in the development of diagnostic technologies and interdisciplinary and intercountry scientific data sharing. A recent bibliometric study has shown that the availability of evidence in response to the COVID-19 pandemic has been much more efficient than other recent epidemic events, such as the 2015-16 Zika virus epidemic and the 2014-16 Ebola virus outbreak due to technology and science advancements and rapid sharing of information. More than 2,500 articles related to COVID-19 were published in the first 4 months of the pandemic, compared to only 88 articles related to both Zika and Ebola viruses in the same epidemiological period. [1] The pace at which viral genomic sequences have been available to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic also illustrates the rapid pace of data sharing over time. [2] As of 31st December 2019, 19 gene sequences of the SARS-CoV-2 virus were already obtainable through the GISAID database (gisaid.org), which now has over 40,000 viral genome sequences shared by laboratories around the globe. As a comparison, it took almost 3 years for the number of sequential viral genomes to reach 1,500 sequences during the Ebola virus outbreak. The rapid developments of SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences contributed to both the rapid development of the gold standard molecular diagnostic tests for COVID-19 and to the development of simplified protocols for complete viral genome sequencing and analysis and labbased serology assays using recombinantly produced SARS-CoV-2 proteins.",

Confidentiality has been one of the most important issues and concerns of the digital revolution and given rapid use of digital platforms on COVID-19 management. Increased privacy concerns are attributed to several health platforms requiring patients to share their personal protected health information, including but not limited to the patient's name, phone number, email, race, country of birth, SSN, residential address and even travel history. This is problematic because of the lack of policies and regulations about the use of personal data.

Mathematical modelling helped in understanding the Aedes spp. Vectors in terms of transmission, host-virus interaction, and effectiveness of potential interventions. Geographical information systems (GIS) including epidemiological maps were used to estimate magnitude, transmission and spread of the Zika outbreak. The category of big data included social media analytics and web-based surveillance particularly on the OpenZika project, Digital Participatory Surveillance (DPS), and ProMED. DPS is a form of digital surveillance where the public reports signs and symptoms through a structured electronic form and the data is summarized via epidemiological maps. Zika tracker, a smartphone-based diagnostic platform could be used anywhere in the world to report suspected or confirmed cases of Zika. WHO's Zika App is a similar app that provides real-time data to all users. Researchers in Brazil developed MinION that is a novel real-time genome-sequencing device. An insecticide wearable device that releases Metofluthrin (traditional repellant of Aedes aegypti) reduced the number of mosquitoes attracted. [4] During the Ebola outbreak, diagnosis was difficult especially in asymptomatic people. The gold-standard diagnostic test for Ebola virus, the real-time RT-PCR needed substantial infrastructure, operation and maintenance of complex equipment, and expertise in molecular techniques. Limitations of the diagnostic tests were addressed by digital solutions. The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) used the National Health Information System to create a dashboard called PATH for monitoring Ebola cases. The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), World Health Organization (WHO) and other organizations worked together to develop digital maps and graphs. In 2019, the Ministry of Health of DRC launched a national agency for clinical information and health informatics (ANICiiS). During the 2014-2016 epidemic, mHERO, an SMS system was set-up to share information with health workers. UNICEF also launched the Rapidpro free source platform that provided SMS messaging in Sierra Leone where it was rare to possess a smart-phone, internet, or even phone credit. [5] [6] [7] HIV/AIDS control strategies included digital solutions such as mapping and maintaining surveillance of high risk behaviors, individual level intervention that targets key populations (during a low-level epidemic), providing voluntary testing and counseling (VTC) and screening for sexually transmitted infections (STIs).",

Containing malaria outbreaks remained a challenge because it was difficult to predict who would contract the disease. As a result, resources were not deployed in the correct region. This caused the outbreak to grow. A quick and reliable digital solution was required. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) used satellite data to help forecast malaria outbreaks by identifying areas of prime breeding grounds for these mosquitoes that overlapped with human population. They use the information on precipitation, temperature, soil moisture, and vegetation around the world and feed it into a prediction model and tell where a puddle is most likely to form. Simply mapping where people reported malaria is not enough as the place of infection is usually different. They also track humans to see where most people are getting infected i.e hotspots. But for the purposes of predicting a malaria outbreak, the map did not tell a complete story. They could successfully make projections down to the household level, allowing for resources to go where they're needed. The population models could be used for tracking not only malaria, but Zika and Dengue as well. [8] The Digital Solutions for Malaria Elimination (DSME) Community of Practice (COP) helped in building malaria surveillance systems that made accurate data reporting easier and thus improved decision-making processes.

There is an increasing emphasis on providing great user experience and information to the citizens so they stay informed and aware of the recent developments, policies, precautions and measures that have been taken up to fight the virus. In this table, we highlight the similarities and differences in user engagement within public/government sites, private clinics, employee/campus organizations, and entering venues (such as flights). It is important to understand the different facilities which are provided by the different organizations and institutions and how the public and government sites can be modified more to support the facility of giving out reminders and covering the insurances for the patients. Also the entry pass system at the public/ government sites should be more digitised to avoid the issues of data privacy and spoofing. Adding on, it is most important to provide the scheduling facility across all the different organizations to avoid the issue of overcrowding and have a systematic approach in place. Even the test results should be supported with a detailed report covering points ranging from a detailed analysis of virus to the precautionary measures that need to be taken by the patient to avoid getting infected in future, in case they are affected a report needs to be shared to indicate the exact steps the patient should take in order to stay protected and at the same time not transmit the infection to others. Table   It is also important to understand more about the user's journey and the steps taken by them in order to get tested. First via social media campaigns, televisions and youtube videos the end user is educated about the different COVID-19 testing centres and sites. Using this information the user tries to explore more about the different sites which may be public, private, educational sites and draws a comparative analysis between them. Once they are certain about the type of site/ organisation they would want to visit next they analyse the different centres and hospitals available for them to visit and this decision is taken based on several parameters such as the type of testing available, cost of testing, time to get the results and one of the crucial points would be the location of thee testing sites. Lastly, once tested the patient/user tends to receive more updates and reminders on taking the necessary dosage and also receive timely reminders via messages. Figure 3 illustrates the standardised process flow for COVID-19 testing. The participants should flow in one direction and each of the stations should be separated by at least 6 feet. Participants begin with a temperature and symptom check. This is also where participants are given a face covering if they don't already have one. Then, they fill out all the necessary paperwork (pens and clipboards are disinfected in between participants). Participants proceed to the interview stations where they are screened for symptoms, after which they are put in testing stations where they are given a swab to collect their specimen. The specimen is then put into a vial and dropped into a transport bag. Lastly, participants are then given the information needed to receive their results [11] .",

There's also a concern people would be penalized for low-risky behavior resulting in a lack of exposure to the virus, which would make them ineligible for a card based on infection-related immunity. Yet, other efficacy, ethical and privacy concerns remain relevant to digital passports based on vaccine-induced immunity. Evidence suggests [17] that, despite being immune, an individual might still transmit disease and infect others. Though different places are planning for non-discriminatory and equal access vaccine distribution, there are multiple unknown challenges along these lines. This could hinder the effectiveness of digital immunity passports . Otherwise, according to ethicists, digital immunity passports might increase racial and social inequalities [18] already exacerbated by the pandemic, repeating the history of immunity passports during \"yellow fever\" epidemics at the beginning of the 20th century. These were used as a means of racial discrimination, and oppression. Digital immunity passports could also facilitate social exclusion [19] and discriminatory work environments, where \"an official stamp of immunity to COVID-19, or personal willingness to risk the disease\" would \"... become a prerequisite for employment\". [18] Finally, the immunity certificates' credentials could create privacy and security risks. And the centralized nature of a digital credential system, where a single institution would be responsible for data collection and credential management, could lead to privacy violations and abuse of power.

The system, based on a web platform and an app, will be tested via a 12-week pilot in Estonia, and if successful, it might become a standard of the future when the vaccine is available on a large-scale and vaccine-immunity is proven to be effective. 5 COVID Credentials Initiative: The COVID-19 Credentials Initiative (CCI) [34] is an international community of more than 300 members from over 100 organizations hoping to deploy and/or help deploy privacy-preserving verification-based credential projects in order to reduce the spread of COVID-19 and strengthen our societies and economies. The CCI has launched the usage of digital identity in order to curb the spread of COVID-19. Their aim involves developing \"immunity passports\" and much more. In this, The CCI uses verifiable credentials. Inspired by the functional utility of a physical credential (e.g. the cards in one's wallet), a verifiable credential (VC) is a declared assertion that contains documented claims about a person or a particular organization. The niche of VCs that make them so pivotal is that they're digitally native and cryptographically secure, providing a great privacy-preserving alternative to other types of credentials, if used responsibly. Upon accepting a VC (e.g. a driver's license) from a trusted issuer (e.g. a government body), holders can generate proof with minimal information (e.g. over 18) to validate to a verifier (e.g. a liquor store ) that they posses their own VCs with specific information (e.g. age), qualifying them for particular types of access defined by the verifier. And there is no need for direct contact between the issuer and verifier throughout the process. 6 Travel health passports: Airlines and tourism organizations are also introducing digital health passports for travelers to enable safer cross-border travel. United and Cathay Pacific [35] Digital Health Verification is one of the most factors that needs to be addressed to ensure the ethical, political and social concerns. The health passports might not eliminate the threat completely, but is an essential tool in this pandemic. Furthermore, these health passports should be privacy preserving, trustworthy and widely accepted. It is also important to be mindful of the potential social and racial discrimination that might entail a health passport based solution.",

Combined with the testing efforts, having a visual representation of the number of country-wise cases along with a wide array of filters to study socio-demographic and geographical variations can be of great use. Dashboards enable us to serve this very purpose. With the purpose of getting a grasp on the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous dashboards have been created at university level, regional, national and global level. While some of them also give resource-related information that includes availability of beds, testing kits, PPEs, masks, and ventilators, dashboards also give diagnostic test-related information including number of tests and positivity rate. Government: The World Health Organization (WHO) dashboard is one of the most broadly-accessed and predicated on visualization techniques of the COVID-19 pandemic. The general populace can navigate this dashboard easily by discovering numbers across the world, such as infected, dead, and recoveries. In addition, the WHO dashboard assists users in evaluating COVID-19 data in real-time as graphics change based on the ever-changing situation. It gives information regarding COVID-19 cases globally in the form of Choropleth and bubble maps. It gives information on new cases, confirmed cases, and number of deaths. The data table covers different regions, states, and areas which also deals with transmission classification. The group demonstrated of COVID-19 on the WHO dashboard provides data on the follow-up guidance for comprehending the pandemic. For example, users can understand the method used to determine the COVID-19 information and to update the dashboard in real-time.

The CDC Dashboard stands out amongst other dashboards since it considers all the factors which are necessary for pandemic evaluation like racial groups affected and infection dates as well. The dashboard by Carnegie Mellon University [56], CovidCast is another national level dashboard that shows a Mapbox level overview which is based on survey data.

However, the point that needs to be taken into account here is that this dashboard is based on survey data and not validated by the government or any other facility. Similarly, governments worldwide have shared public dashboards for effective analysis of the situation. The Canadian government website [57] can be used to analyze the general trend of the COVID-19 situation and shares immense knowledge right awareness resources to symptoms and treatments. Radio Canada [58] is another dashboard that provides a nationwide view of Canada in terms of COVID-19 along with the testing figures.

Furthermore, often the loss of information happens through stolen physical records or misplaced patient records which contain a lot of PII (\"Personally Identifiable Information\") and PHI (\"Protected Healthcare Information\"). The fact that medical data is more life-long and cannot be changed exacerbates the issues associated, unlike in the case of any financial data breaches. This longevity makes it a long-term threat for the person whose data was compromised. Another fact to consider is that the highly interconnected nature of health care devices like -insulin pumps, pacemakers, scanning devices, etc could leave threats open to not just the leakage of information but also on the medical health of people relying on such medical aids. [72] A survey from Accenture [73] in Feb 2017 revealed that 26% of U.S. consumers or more than one in every four Americans are a victim of the healthcare data breaches. Furthermore, a large percentage of the people who took the survey (about 50% of breach victims) suffered from medical identity theft, with an average of $2,500 outof-pocket costs due to the healthcare data breaches. To make matters worse, about 50% of the respondents shared that they were not informed by the company/legal institution about the breach, i.e., they learned of the breach themselves after they'd been alerted to an error on their benefits explanation, credit card statement, or similar documents.

Within the Constitution however, the right to privacy has been found to be a fundamental right [77] under the Right to Life and Liberty [78] , as declared by the Supreme Court. The Information Technology Act, 2000 read with the Information Technology Rules 2011 -providing context of procedures, sensitive personal data and information reasoned with security practices -have been found to be inept. Nevertheless, there are two draft legislation: Personal Data Protection Bill,2019 (pending in Parliament) and Digital Information Security in Health Care Act (put out by the Health Ministry and specifically deals with sharing of healthcare data). These new pieces of legislation hope to bridge the gap between privacy considerations and public health. On account of the pandemic, the Indian Government launched a contact tracing app \"Aarogya Setu\" to tackle COVID-19. The software application clearly mentions data sharing upfront in a conspicuous place when consent is gained during user registration in the Application. This helps informs the potential users about data sharing through this Application. The details of the personal information gathered, the method in which it is gathered, and by whom as well as the purpose for which it will be used is set out in its Privacy Policy [79] . Besides, the Government has initiated a National Digital Health Mission as a part of which unique digital IDs will be provided as a single source of health information for the patients, government, and healthcare providers through interoperable health records. The NHA (National Health Authority) will play a crucial role in the development of these policies and managing NDHM. However, the lack of a legal framework for data protection in the country has increased the risks related to digitization. Privacy issues with Aarogya setu: 1) App fails to clarify which ministry or department will be accessing data suggesting interdepartmental exchanges of personal information. This makes ensuring accountability challenging. 2) No legal framework to regulate the application forcing users to accept T&C and privacy policy given by the government. 3) Uses location data via GPS trails in addition to Bluetooth, deviating from \"privacy-focused global standards\" which are confined to Bluetooth-based technology like TraceTogether app(Singapore) and framework suggested by MIT as a tool to monitor movement of patients and contact tracing. 4) The unique digital identity in Aarogya Setu is a static number, which increases the probability of identity breaches. \u2022 Vietnam: Vietnam lacks a unified comprehensive data protection legislation.",

These legal instruments, as a general principle, are personal data of individuals. While the laws fail to define the scope of personal data and the definition also varies between sectors, the laws are interpreted to protect, at a minimum, information that would enable the identification of an individual. The primary legislation regulating data protection is Cybersecurity law. It is to be noted that unlike cybersecurity laws in other jurisdictions (inspired by the GDPR of the EU) the Cybersecurity Law of Vietnam shares similarities with China's Cybersecurity Law enacted in 2017. Such legal precedents focus on providing the government with the ability to control the flow of information, instead of enforcing data privacy rights for individual data subjects. [80] In addition, the Law on Information Technology requires that the entity collecting personal data must provide data subjects with information about the form, scope, place, purpose of collecting, processing, and using personal data. Further, the collection, storage, use, and transfer of such data must have the consent of such a person [81] . Vietnam's Law on Information Technology (IT Law) requires organizations and individuals that collect, process and use personal information of other people in the network environment to obtain the consent of those people unless otherwise provided by law.Severe or Emerging Contagious Diseases fall within the definition of \"Class A Infectious Diseases\" under the Law on Prevention and Control of Infectious Diseases (LPCID) and individuals/ organizations in Vietnam are required to take sanitation, disinfection and sterilization measures according to instructions of competent health agencies. As a general principle, Vietnamese Data Privacy Laws protect information pertaining to or belonging to individuals or (to a lesser degree, organizations) that can serve to personally identify individuals (i.e., personal data). While Vietnamese Data Privacy Laws do not consistently define what information constitutes personal data and the definition also varies between sectors, the laws are interpreted to protect, at a minimum, information that would enable the identification of an individual. Specifically, the Law on Information Technology requires that the entity collecting personal data must provide data subjects with information about the form, scope, place, purpose of collecting, processing, and using personal data.

The following are some of the main privacy protection features of Blue Zones: Data security: The Bluezone app stores data locally and doesn't send any data to the system, No location data collection: The Bluezone app does not collect geo-location data, Anonymity: All Bluezone app users are anonymous to each other. Only competent and verified health authorities know those whose infected and who are suspected of infection due to close contact with COVID-19 cases, Transparency: The Bluezone Project codebase is completely open source. \u2022 South Korea: The pandemic response of South Korea has been touted as an example to be followed by other nations. Nevertheless, its excessive testing and tracing strategy has come under the radar of privacy-related scrutiny. The data privacy in South Korea is regulated by three major legislations: Private Information Protection Act (PIPA), the Act on the Use and Protection of Credit Information ('Credit Information Act'), and the Act on the Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization, these amendments were to which were made recently. The Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA) implemented in South Korea imposes strict compliance requirements on entities that collect any potential information that can be used for identifying a specific person. Citizens also have the right to be forgotten, among other data ownership right. While organizations in the private and public sectors are legally obliged to comply with the PIPA, government agencies that require personal data for public interest purposes can collect and use data without the need to obtain consent. [83] Although it is expected that organizations will use personal information on justifiable grounds by evaluating the 'reasonable relevance' of personal data and information that they intend to use and maintaining and preserving relevant records. Countries that sought to follow this model can face challenges by their own domestic data privacy laws especially those subjected to GDPR.The mobile application South Korea is using monitors and tracks the location of all visitors to the country, as well. Individuals, including tourists, wear a location-tracking bracelet which is referred to as \"smart city tech.\" The smart city tech platform shares information between cities on various things including traffic and pollution to find vulnerabilities and congestion, which makes it easier to identify hot spots for COVID-19. [84] The PIPA required data to be deleted post its utilization for the purpose it is collected.But the government has admitted that it will be permanently storing data of patients from the previous epidemic. \u2022 Germany: The German \"Datenschutzkonferenz\" which is a collective body composed of independent federal and state data protection authorities notified guidelines regarding COVID-19 and data protection. According to guidelines, sharing personal information of individuals infected with COVID-19 or those suspected of it would be lawful provided revealing their identity is exceptionally crucial for protecting people they were in contact with. Also, in such cases, reference should be taken to article 6(1)9c) or (f) of GDPR.For other instances, health data must be kept confidential and only be used for the purpose it was collected in the first place.Consent of data subject must be taken. To keep track of the number of lab tests regarding SARS-COV-2 carried out per week in Germany and how many among them are positive and negative , the RKI has initated a country-wide laboratory query in Germany. However, the quantity of laboratories reporting data seems to vary week to week. And by subtracting each change (per week) from the cumulative total, we retrospectively work out the cumulative totals at the end of each week. Because labs are able to post-check the tests of previous calendar weeks in the test number query of RKI, the initial figures may be revised upwards to a slight extent in subsequent reports. These sources explicitly state that the figures refer to tests conducted and that this wouldn't eqaute to the number of people tested, because of multiple tests can be done on one person. [85] Germany launched an official coronavirus tracing app in June 2020 which is touted to be so secure that even government ministers can use it, though developers acknowledged few discrepancies. Germany like other EU nations have chosen against centrally storing data through its tracing app. [86] This step was taken in compliance with data privacy standards. [87] Smartphone apps have been claimed as a high-tech tools for tracking down potential COVID-19 infections. Experts state that finding new cases quickly is key to clamping down fresh clusters of cases, especially as countries progressively emerge from lockdowns and try to avoid a second wave of deaths and infections. But governments and legislative authorities in Europe have run into hurdles of legal and cultural restrictions and are trying to reconcile the necessity for effective contact tracing with the continent's strict data privacy and digital security standards. Germany -where a person's right to their own data even after death is rooted in the constitution -has proven to be a particular challenge. Early government suggestions to use cell tower information and GPS coordinates for the app prompted a swift backlash. \u2022 China: Several legislations are in shape in the Republic of China for personal data protection such as National security law of the people's republic of china, General provision of the civil law of the people's republic of china, and cybersecurity law which in some way similar to General Data Protection Regulations by European Union. In addition, China has also introduced a draft data protection legislation recently. The CAC (Cyberspace Administration of China) released a notice on the protection of personal information when using big data joint support and defense [88] . The prime objective of this notice was to set some ground rules for the use of personal information of the users to control the spread of COVID-19. Specifically, this notice addresses Limiting Entities: Multiple entities dealing with personal data also raises privacy issues. Only entities authorized by the National Health Commission, in accordance with cybersecurity law, should be allowed to collect personal information for public health purposes, Data collected should have a targeted approach: Personal information which is collected for the purpose of COVID-19 tracing should not be used for any other purpose, Data minimization: Limited amount of data should be collected to prevent any further breach of privacy or misuse of that data collected, and Cybersecurity requirements: A strict and effective implementation of cybersecurity law will help to prevent personal information from being misused. From the above case-studies it is more than evident that we need different strategies to curb this virus across the globe, to ensure the citizens of the respective country stay safe and protected. Also, we can see the different measures taken to address the concerns of data privacy and protection, risk profiling analysis, social and racial discrimiation and economic development. These measures could help inform the decisions of countries or regions in similar situations.",

As a solution for data privacy of individuals testing at medical centers, data silos may be effective, yet they bring about additional problems. Data silos prevent a possibility to conduct detailed analysis of COVID-19 testing data, which would be effective in multiple ways, including evaluating the efficacy of testing methods in different demographics. Such analysis is made impossible by data silos' insularity, preventing health officials from seeing the bigger picture. [89] [90] A solution, as part of our wishlist, is to create a data lake instead; a centralized data repository optimized for analysis. Data silos are by nature decentralized, which makes it difficult to enforce a uniform protocol for data governance. A data lake fixes this additional problem due to its centralized nature. [91] Rather than achieving anonymization through insularity, a more intelligent approach can be taken by protecting data privacy with fine-grained, data-centric control. Furthermore, one of the primary motives of sharing the data is to learn representations and draw insights from it. Privacy preserving machine learning has been on the rise in recent times. [92] Strategies like federated learning -a machine learning setting in which a centralized model is brought to localized data for training rather than data being brought to the model -can be used to ensure no explicit sharing of raw data. Split learning may also be used for this purpose; split learning is a specialized neural network method in which a designated layer in a neural network, the cut layer, 'splits' the network between client and server. These privacy solutions, among others, support data lakes as the best of both worlds in efficacy and privacy.",

            "text": "Many governments around the world have suggested a scheme of health passports/immunity passports since a clear solution for COVID-19 management including vaccine distribution remains in its early stages and will take months before it reaches the common man globally. It is proposed that the identification of antibodies in COVID-19 virus-causing persons, the SARS-CoV-2 virus, may be used as the basis for health/immunity passports globally [17] . Owing to the transient nature in terms of presence of antibodies, looking at the presence/absence of it alone could lead to issues. It might be a better option to look into vaccine based immunisation as an indicator. Adding on, we believe that a random number index is the best way to connect a user to their data, rather than a name, phone number, or email address. Later, the user will use a random number to validate their test results. The research needs to be done to understand the participant's knowledge about various aspects such as the use of masks, the use of hand sanitizer, avoiding going to school, and college for work can prevent the spread of viruses. There are a lot of upcoming strategies and areas in which scientists and researchers are trying to explore and venture to track and avoid the exponential spread of the virus [93] . These methods help to improve performance, shorten the timeline for obtaining outcomes, reduce costs and reduce the complexity involved in carrying out these studies. Some of the prominent references to current and upcoming test activities are STOPCovid [94] an initiative by MIT researchers and scientists to provide test facilities at a cheaper cost to non-laboratory experts to perform experiments in their home or private premises. Next, leveraging AI for testing, where simpler forms could be used to detect COVID, such as cough [95] , breadth, and saliva. The use of these facilities will not only make the process simpler and easier to carry out, but will also allow the authorities to expand the reach of the testing and in turn, help control the available capital and supplies, but will also extend the testing to the community level, including mass population testing.",

Subsequently, the technological landscape of the development of the diagnosis of COVID-19 is rapidly coming up with new knowledge that is formed on a daily basis. Numerous platforms for Open and rapid sharing of data has contributed to this rapid diagnostic development. In this early draft we have introduced the digital landscape of the testing workflows, the user centric issues and the challenges and consequences associated with each of these. Further we have enumerated multiple major dashboards contributing to the surveillance of COVID-19 and case studies pertinent to the digital management of resources from different countries. We have mapped the landscape of current testing systems, challenges and potential solutions.",

Similarly, to a Chilean solution, users share the information about their test results and medical certificates via a QR-code generated after digital authentication. 3 Health Passport Ireland: Ireland began a digital health passport pilot in August [31]. It is based on privacy-preserving technologies, with only an authorized medical administrator allowed to create Health Passport Ireland accounts and make updates of the test results. The app displays green status if the test result was negative, red if positive and amber if a new test is required [21]. The color-code certification system is somewhat similar to the apps that have been introduced in China [22] and the UAE's Alshosn app [32]. 4 COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate pilot: Most recently, WHO established an international partnership between Estonia on WHO Digital COVID-19 Vaccination Infrastructure [33]",

As of September 2020, 6L people have been tested through the Baseline COVID-19 program. BioReference Laboratories [47] have played a key role in the crisis as well as provided support to various patients as well as government agencies. Mayoclinic[48]  which is an American non-profit organization focused on patient care, research and education has also played a significant role in terms of testing.
