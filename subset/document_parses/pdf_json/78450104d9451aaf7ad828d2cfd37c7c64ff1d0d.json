Methods: Participants included child-parent dyads seen in a PED following the state's issuance of mandatory stay-at-home orders on 19 March 2020. A total of 351 children age 0-25 years and 335 parents enrolled in the study. Parents provided baseline demographic data and completed standardised surveys that assessed aspects of parental and child anxiety and parental health, as well as child new-onset maladaptive behaviours. Children \u22658 years of age completed surveys that assessed child anxiety. Findings: Parents reported the new onset of maladaptive behaviours in children during the pandemic with frequencies up to 43%. Bivariate analysis identified predictors such as child anxiety (t(96) = \u00c02.04, P = 0.044) as well as parental variables such as state anxiety (t(190) = \u00c04.91, P < 0.001) and parental sensitivity to anxiety (t(243) = \u00c03.19, P = 0.002). A logistic regression model identified parent mental health and COVID-19 anxiety as predictors of new onset maladaptive behaviours in children (X 2 (6) = 42.514, P < 0.001). Specifically, every unit change in parental anxiety of COVID-19 was associated with a unit increase in maladaptive behaviours in children. Conclusions: We identified distinct parent and child-related factors that predicted new onset child maladaptive behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. The identification of such predictors may help clinicians to prevent maladaptive responses to the pandemic quarantine.",

            "text": "COVID-19 was first diagnosed in Wuhan City, China, in December 2019. By March 2020, the World Health Organisation had declared a global pandemic. Although the knowledge base regarding children's responses to the COVID-19 pandemic has been expanding, descriptions of children's responses to pandemics remain scarce. 1 Previous studies showed that children who are isolated or quarantined during pandemics are more likely to develop acute stress disorder, adjustment disorder and grief. 2 The psychological impact on youth stems from stressors such as fears of infection, frustration, boredom, inadequate information, lack of in-person social contact, lack of personal space at home and financial strain on the family. 3 Studies conducted in China during the COVID-19 pandemic showed increased levels of anxiety and depression as well as an increase in clinging and irritability among children of all ages. 4, 5 Numerous studies published to date have established the impact of parental emotional/behavioural functioning on the emotional/ behavioural functioning of the child. 6, 7 New-onset maladaptive (negative psychological) reactions such as general anxiety, nighttime crying, enuresis, separation anxiety and temper tantrums have been reported to be a result of stressful events such as surgery and are highly affected by child anxiety and a number of parental factors. 8, 9 Because there is evidence that children presenting to the PED experience significant anxiety, 10 one could hypothesize that such anxiety would be significantly heightened during a pandemic and would lead to increased incidence of new onset maladaptive behaviours. Identification of predictors to such new-onset pandemic-related maladaptive behaviours may inform treatment. 4 The goal of the present study was to determine the incidence of new-onset maladaptive behaviours in PED patients during the COVID-19 pandemic and to identify child and parent predictors for these behaviours.",

The five-point scale for responses ranges from 0 (very little) to 4 (very much). Items that assessed concerns about H1N1 virus were revised for the investigation of concerns about COVID-19, based on previous research and clinical observations. 11 Parental State Anxiety was evaluated with a self-reported Visual Analogue Scale for Anxiety (VAS-A) by answering questions using a 10-cm horizontal line that extended from the anchor of \"not anxious\" to the anchor of \"very anxious\". This tool has been validated against other measures of anxiety (e.g. Spielberger State, Trait Anxiety Inventory). 12 Parental Sensitivity to Anxiety was measured with the Anxiety Sensitivity Index-3 (ASI-3), 13 a parent self-report tool that assesses beliefs about the feared consequences of symptoms associated with anxious arousal. Respondents indicate their agreement with various statements on a scale from 0 to 4. The measure has demonstrated reliability and validity as a psychometric tool. 13 For the current study, parents were asked to respond to measure items based on how they typically feel, not specific to COVID-19 or the COVID-19 pandemic.",

This widely used 27-item measure assesses new onset behavioural changes across six subscales: general anxiety and regression, separation anxiety, eating disturbance, aggression toward authority, apathy/withdrawal and anxiety about sleep. 16 Originally developed to assess maladaptive behaviours in children after ambulatory surgery, the PHBQ was used in the current study to assess the incidence of new onset of maladaptive behaviours since the child had been informed of the pandemic.

This association may reflect the transference of stress from parents to children. Child anxiety sensitivity scores suggested that children in our sample were experiencing elevated levels of anxiety during the pandemic, compared to mean levels in a similar paediatric clinical sample assessed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Previous studies of the psychological predictors of anxiety surrounding other disease outbreaks (e.g. H1N1, Ebola) in college students showed that health anxiety was a significant predictor of swine flu-related anxiety and that physical concerns related to sensitivity to anxiety predicted fear of Ebola. 11, 22 In one study, children's fear of the swine flu was significantly related to parents' fear of the disease. 23 However, these studies did not examine the association between pandemic fear and new-onset maladaptive behaviours. One recent study investigated behavioural changes during the COVID-19 pandemic in healthy children 3-18 years of age living in China. The authors found clinging, inattention and irritability in >30% of the study population. 5 Another study of school-age children previously diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder demonstrated a significant worsening of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic. 24 Our PED study sample represents a population that may especially benefit from screening for new-onset maladaptive behaviours during the COVID-19 pandemic as parents and children presenting to the PED may be experiencing additional distress related to their need for urgent medical care. Child anxiety sensitivity scores suggested that children in our sample were experiencing elevated levels of anxiety during the pandemic, compared to mean levels in a similar paediatric clinical sample assessed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. 25 Interventions designed to reduce COVID-19 anxiety in parents may affect maladaptive behaviour in children, but it is unclear if such interventions would impact baseline parental or child anxiety that is not related to the pandemic. In this study, parent state anxiety and anxiety sensitivity, as well as anxiety sensitivity in children, were associated with increased risk for maladaptive behaviours. Previous work has shown that stressful health-related events, such as a child needing surgery, can result in new maladaptive behaviours and that preoperative parent and child anxiety are associated with an increase in risk for maladaptive behaviours after surgery. 8, 9 In addition, a recent study conducted in Italy demonstrated that a parent's perception of the difficulty of quarantine was significantly associated with parental stress levels, as well as the incidence of psychological issues in children. 26 Our current study suggests that baseline anxiety in parents as well as children may be associated with maladaptive behaviours in children during the stressful event of mandatory quarantine for a pandemic. Efforts to target anxiety may be useful in reducing the incidence of these negative behaviours. Interviews that include questions to the parent about whether the child or parent has been diagnosed with anxiety might be helpful to clinicians in efforts to screen for children likely to exhibit negative behaviours during the implementation of stay-at-home guidelines.",

Of note, approximately 34% of the children included in the study were being seen for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19, and 9.5% were ultimately tested for COVID-19.

It is important to note that one common reason for non-participation was extreme parent or child anxiety. This may have biased the study toward a less anxious population; however, parent anxiety sensitivity levels were comparable to non-clinical norms 13 and child anxiety was higher than a pre-COVID-19 paediatric sample. 25 Furthermore, the selection of subjects in the ED is an obvious confound because ED visits are stressful in and of themselves; associated stress was further compounded by concerns related to virus exposure in waiting rooms and hospitals.

Understanding the psychological factors that predict anxiety and maladaptive behaviours in the context of a disease outbreak is vital, as it may inform the treatment and prevention of health-related anxiety. 27 Additional studies are needed to identify treatable subcomponents of stress and specific populations most likely to benefit from counselling. The data obtained may accelerate the rate at which ED staff can identify high-risk situations. Future research should also be targeted toward elucidating appropriate interventions for parents and their children to ameliorate maladaptive behaviours.
