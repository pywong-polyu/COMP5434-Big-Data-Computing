A significantly greater proportion of patients with ovarian and peritoneal cancer, as well as advanced-stage cancers, were undergoing treatment compared to the post-treatment group. The DIT and HADS anxiety scores were higher in patients undergoing treatment than in the follow-up group. One third of the patients undergoing cancer treatment showed a significantly high anxiety score. Surprisingly, 50% of patients showed a high depression score in both groups, which was higher than the proportion in a previous study. 1 Patients who were tested at least Our study has some limitations. Due to the possible selection bias, the results cannot be generalized. Moreover, the sample size was small; therefore, we could not rule out possible confounding factors such as origin and stage of cancer.",
