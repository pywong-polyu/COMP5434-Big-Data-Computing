Minimum flow decomposition (MFD) -the problem of finding a minimum set of paths that perfectly decomposes a flow -is a classical problem in Computer Science, and variants of it are powerful models in multiassembly problems in Bioinformatics (e.g. RNA assembly). However, because this problem and its variants are NP-hard, practical multiassembly tools either use heuristics or solve simpler, polynomial-time solvable versions of the problem, which may yield solutions that are not minimal or do not perfectly decompose the flow. Many RNA assemblers also use integer linear programming (ILP) formulations of such practical variants, having the major limitation they need to encode all the potentially exponentially many solution paths. Moreover, the only exact solver for MFD does not scale to large instances, and cannot be efficiently generalized to practical MFD variants.",

            "text": "Flow decomposition (FD), the problem of decomposing a network flow into a set of source-to-sink paths and associated weights that perfectly explain the flow values on the edges, is a classical and well-studied concept in Computer Science. For example, it is a standard result that any flow in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with m edges can be decomposed into at most m weighted paths (see, e.g., [1] ). However, finding an FD with a minimum number of paths (MFD) is NP-hard [53] , even on DAGs. This result was later strengthened by [16] who proved that MFD is hard to approximate (i.e., there is some > 0 such that MFD cannot be approximated to within a (1 + ) factor, unless P=NP). More recent work has shown that the problem is FPT in the size of the minimum decomposition [22] , and that it can be approximated with an exponential factor [33] . It is also possible to decompose all but a \u03b5-fraction of the flow within a O(1/\u03b5) factor of the optimal number of paths [16] . Heuristic approaches to the problem have also been developed, particularly greedy methods based on choosing the widest or longest paths [53] , which can be improved by making iterative modifications to the flow graph before finding a greedy decomposition [45] . But despite this history of work on algorithms for MFD, an exact solver that is fast for instances with large optimal solutions or large flow values remains elusive.",

For example, some network routing problems (e.g. [17, 9, 16, 33] ) and transportation problems (e.g. [35, 36] ) require FDs that are optimal with respect to various measures. MFDs in particular are used to reconstruct biological sequences such as RNA transcripts [38, 50, 11, 5, 49, 59] , and viral quasispecies [4] . However, because MFD is NP-hard, all of these tools in fact use heuristics or solve some simpler version of the problem ignoring some information that is available from the sequencing process, resulting in tools that may not reconstruct the correct sequence, even if no other errors are present. More broadly, it has been noted [34] that the lack of exact solvers for many of the sub-problems involved in DNA sequencing has led to heuristic and ad hoc tools with no provable guarantees on the quality of solutions. Additionally, some authors [5, 7] have noted that there is a tradeoff between the complexity of the model for RNA assembly (i.e., how much of the true possible solution space that it supports) and its tractability. But if a fast exact solver for MFD exists, this tradeoff may not be necessary.",

            "text": "While the biological realities underlying the different multiassembly problems may yield some differences in how the problems can be solved, at their heart many approaches contain the algorithmic step of decomposing a network flow into weighted paths. The basic setup and approach for multiassembly is as follows. Given a sample of unknown sequences, each with some unknown abundance (for example, a set of RNA transcripts or virus strains), all sequences are multiplied and then broken into fragments that can be read by next-generation sequencers to produce millions of sequence reads ranging from hundreds of tens of thousands DNA characters in length. Many approaches are reference-based (e.g., [50, 52, 32, 38, 23, 5, 26] for RNA assembly and [62, 51] for viral quasispecies assembly), meaning that they use a previously-constructed reference genome to guide the assembly process. These approaches construct a graph using the sequences contained in the reads where nodes are strings, edges represent overlaps, and weights on edges give the counts of reads that support each overlap. Because a reference is used, these graphs are always DAGs. In the non-reference case (called de novo), graphs may have cycles; we address this further at the end of the paper. If errors are minimal, the weights on the edges should form a flow on the network, and the underlying sequences and their abundances must be some decomposition of the flow into weighted paths. For RNA assembly, recent work [22, 60] has confirmed the common assertion (e.g., by [50, 44, 23, 31, 64, 28, 30] ) that the true transcripts and abundances should be minimum flow decomposition. No such study has been done for viral quasispecies assembly, but existing tools seek minimum-sized decompositions [4, 58] . However, while the abovementioned tools seek minimum-sized flow decompositions, since MFD is NP-hard, they in fact compute decompositions that are not guaranteed to be minimum (and thus may not give the correct assembly, even when no other errors are present).",

Existing ILP solvers like Gurobi [13] and CPLEX [47] incorporate optimizations that allow for fast runtimes in practice for problems that should be hard in general (see also [14] for various applications of ILP in Bioinformatics). Indeed, many existing multiassembly tools do use ILP to solve MFD as one step in their process. The basic idea behind these existing formulations is to consider some set of source-to-sink paths through the graph and assign each a binary variable indicating whether or not it is selected in the optimal solution, along with constraints to fully encode the FD problem (i.e. that the selected set of paths-with the weights derived for them by the ILP-form an FD) and to model further practical aspects of the specific multiassembly problem. However, the number of paths in a DAG is exponential, meaning that if the tools enumerate all paths (and thus can be guaranteed to find the true optimal solution) they are impractical for larger instances (e.g., Toboggan [22] ). The most common strategy is to pre-select some set of paths, either for all instances (e.g., vg-flow [4] and CLIIQ [28] ), or only when the input is large (e.g., MultiTrans [64] and SSP [40] ). But by pre-selecting paths, these formulations may not find the optimal MFD solution for the instance.",

However, their solution is slightly less general, since it works only for DAGs having a Hamiltonian path. If Hamiltonicity holds, any source-to-sink path can be encoded as a subset of edges that do not pairwise overlap in the Hamiltonian path (i.e., the tail of an edge does not appear before the head of another edge in the Hamiltonian path). As such, to avoid such pairwise edge overlaps they require a number of constraints that is quadratic in the size of the graph.",

The key idea is that any path must have a conserved (unit) flow from its start to its end, and that this concept can be encoded using only a number of variables and constraints that is linear in the size of the graph (rather than exponential, as is the case when the model enumerates all possible paths). This is a standard integer programming method for expressing paths in DAGs, used for example in [48] . An implementation of our ILP formulation using CPLEX finds optimal flow decomposition solutions on RNA assembly graphs (simulated and assembled from real reads) in under 13 seconds on average, over all the datasets tested. This is several times faster than the state-of-the-art MFD solver Toboggan [22] , depending on the dataset. While heuristic solvers such as Catfish [45] or CoasterHeuristic [60] finish withing a few seconds, we show that they do not provide optimum solutions. Another benefit of our ILP solutions is that all optimum solutions can be reported by the ILP solver, thus potentially helping in \"identifying\" the correct RNA multiassembly solution (a practical issue acknowledged by e.g. [29, 19] ).",

            "text": "Flexible: In practice, many multiassembly tools in fact solve variants of MFD. For example, many tools account for paired-end reads by requiring that they be included in the same path. Another common strategy is to incorporate longer reads as subpath constraints or phasing paths [38, 44, 60] which again must be covered by some predicted transcript (i.e. flow path). In Section 3.2, we give additional constraints that are expressive enough to not only encode paired-end reads and subpath constraints, but also any generic set of edges that must be covered by a single path (e.g., as when modelling the recent Smart-seq3 protocol producing RNA multi-end reads [15] ). Additionally, due to sequencing or read mapping errors, the weights on edges may not be a flow (i.e. flow conservation might not hold). One approach in this case is to consider intervals of edge weights instead, as in [40, 59] . We give a formulation to handle this approach in Section 3. 3 . Our implementation solves subpath constraint instances in similar time to standard instances, while the existing exact solver could not complete on many instances in under 60 seconds. Moreover, while the existing interval heuristic is fast, it finds decompositions that are far from optimum. While all these additional constraints are naturally expressed in ILP (further underlining the flexibility of our approach), the novelty here is their integration with the ILP encoding of all possible paths in the DAG from Section 3. 1. In Appendix B, we give MFD formulations dealing with the total error over all edges. We can consider an upper bound on the total error, or seek a minimum decomposition that also achieves the minimum error, as studied in [49] and used in RNA assemblers such as [26, 24, 5, 50] . Finally, we note that our formulation could also be used to find decompositions for any of the above variants using a fixed, or upper bounded, number of paths, which is useful if further information is available.",

Using this, one can easily solve the MFD problem by finding smallest k such that the flow network admits a k-flow decomposition. Notice that any DAG admits a flow decomposition of size at most |E|, see e.g., [1] (since one can iteratively take the edge with smallest flow value and create an s-t path of weight equaling this flow value). Moreover, if assuming integer weights, another trivial upper bound on the size of any flow decomposition is |f |, namely the flow exiting s, and there is always a flow decomposition with |f | paths of weight one. Thus, if there is a k-flow decomposition, there is also a k -flow decomposition, for all k < k \u2264 min{|E|, |f |} (just duplicate a path of weight greater than one, and move weight one from the old copy to the new one). This shows that when searching for the smaller k such that the graph admits a k-flow decomposition we can either do a linear scan in increasing order, or binary search. Since k is usually small in our applications, we just do a linear scan. As mentioned at the end of Section 2, the problem can also be defined as allowing real flow values and/or weights. Our ILP formulation can also handle this variant by just changing the domain of the corresponding variables (in which case we will obtain a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP)) 3 .",

If we assign value 1 for each edge on the path, and value 0 for each edge not on the path, then these binary values correspond to a conceptual flow in the graph (V, E) (different from the input flow). Moreover, this conceptual flow induced by the (single) path is such that the flow out-going from s is 1 and the flow in-coming to t is 1.

We use one of the larger transcriptomes 4 and call this dataset SRR020730-Salmon. We also produce perfect splice graphs by running HiSat2 [20] with the provided GRCh38 reference index and then popular RNA assembly tool StringTie [23] on real RNA reads from SRR307903, and superimposing the resulting transcripts and abundances (after rounding abundances to the nearest integer).

On the other hand, Coaster is both slow on small instances, and does not solve large instances. This shows that the Toboggan implementation is optimized to use many properties of the standard MFD problem, that are not generalizable to variants of it of practical applicability, such as Problem MFDSC.

In fact, a large number of practical RNA assemblers use an ILP formulation at their core, thanks to their flexibility in modeling various aspects of real data.

Further flexibility also comes from the fact that all our ILPs are based on modeling a specific type of flow decomposition with a given, or upper bounded number k of paths (thus, they do not need to solve the minimum version of the problem). On both simulated and real datasets, we show that our ILP formulations finish within 13 seconds on any instance, and within a few seconds on most instances.",

            "text": "An alternative approach to handle a graph whose weights to not satisfy the flow conservation property flow consists in directly taking the observed read coverages, and trying to find a set of path whose superposition best explains the observed coverages under some error model, penalizing the difference between the observed coverage of an edge and the sum of the weights of the paths going through that edge. This problem has been formalized in [49] and also proven NP-hard. To formalize this problem, we denote by imperfect flow network any DAG (V, E) with unique source s and unique sink t, where for every edge we have an associated integer positive value f uv (not necessarily satisfying the flow conservation property). A first formulation of such an MFD variant imposes a fixed bound on the total error of all of the edges.Problem 4 (Minimum imperfect flow decomposition (bounded error)). Given an imperfect flow network G = (V, E, f ), and an error bound B \u2265 0, find (if it exists) a minimum-sized set of s-t paths P = (P 1 , . . . , P k )Notice that Problem 4 is a strict generalization of the MFD problem, which is obtained by taking B = 0. As done in Section 3.3, we can obtain an ILP for it by extending the ILP formulation for k-Flow Decomposition to express Eq. (11) by the following two sets of linear equations:This model is for a fixed k value, and a full solution for Problem 4 is obtained by trying all values of k in increasing order until the ILP formulation admits a solution. Notice that the same upper bound k \u2264 |E|, since any solution to Problem 4 (i.e. any set of weighted s-t paths) induces a flow, which is decomposable into at most |E| weighted paths.Another formulation, defined by [49] and at the core of RNA multiassembly tools such as [26, 24, 5, 50] , asks to minimize the total sum of squared errors with a minimum number of paths.Problem 5 (Minimum imperfect flow decomposition (minimum total error) [49] ). Given an imperfect flow network G = (V, E, f ), find a set of s-t paths P = (P 1 , . . . , P k ) and associated weights w = (w 1 , . . . , w k ), minimizingand among all such sets of paths, find one with minimum k (i.e. with minimum cardinality).For a given number k of path, Eq. (12) can be used as an objective function in an Integer Quadratic Problem (IQP), which can solved by commercial solvers such as CPLEX and Gurobi. The main requirements is that the objective function is quadratic and convex, such as:As before, to fully solve Problem 5, one can iterate over k from 1 to |E| (upper bound holding by the same reasoning as above), and choose the smallest one attaining Eq. (13) .",
