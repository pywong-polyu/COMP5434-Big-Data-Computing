Without immunization tools, physical distancing is one of the most promising public health measure to slow down the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [2, 3] . Accordingly, many governments reacted to the rapid spread of the virus with the implementation of politically enforced measures, which included economic shutdown, closing of borders, and social and travel restrictions. For instance, in Germany, hard lockdown measures resolved around mid-March 2020 and included the closure of schools, restaurants, shops, leisure facilities, and sports clubs, as well as restrictions on visits to hospitals and nursing care facilities [4] . Additionally, social contacts were restricted, allowing only a limited number of private meetings. One of the most impressive effects of these measures is the reduced mobility of an entire society.",

One of these options is the possibility to measure the effects of reduced mobility, in particular road, railway, and air traffic, on noise levels in urban areas. As environmental noise is one of the most important environmental health risks, with many people being affected [5, 6] , noise management and mitigation practices are a significant concern for citizens and public health and a key objective for government policy. In order to achieve the transition to sustainable mobility, which is crucial according to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN 2015) , the impact of reduced internal-combustion-engine-based mobility could be valuable to project the implications of transformation solutions.",

One of the most striking visual impressions was of empty streets and highways, which are usually characterized by a high traffic volume. The visual impressions are also underlined by changes in environmental sound. For example, an online survey from Lyon, France, including more than 3000 people, revealed that perceived noise has decreased in both urban and countryside areas [10] . In particular, respondents reported hearing less traffic noise and more nature sounds. Elsewhere, handclapping events took place during the coronavirus pandemic, and out-of-order church bell ringing has been observed, e.g., in Australia, which provided unique elements to the soundscape [11, 12] ; however, no special public sound events were performed by the citizens of Bochum.",

However, most studies published so far are based on spatially limited data or a small number of monitoring stations. For instance, one study focused on traffic related noise [13] , two on public places [15] and city centers with each only one monitoring station [17] . Only three studies so far used a broader representation of the city, including residential areas [10, 14, 16] . However, it is unknown if these survey sites are selected as typical land use types. Furthermore, since the time and extent of societal lockdown measures differ distinctly between countries and even between cities in one country, further studies are warranted demonstrating environmental effects of this tremendous reduction in traffic volume, which would likely never be observed in normal times.",

Additionally, on 17 March, the closure of bars, clubs, discos, theaters, cinemas and museums, gyms, swimming pools, saunas, adult education centers, music schools, sports clubs, other sports and recreational facilities, arcades, gambling halls, prostitution establishments, and prohibition of all public events was implemented [4] . In the same way, on March 23, further regulation came into force, including restrictions on meetings and gatherings in public of more than two persons with exceptions for relatives, spouses or life partners, household members, minors, compulsory meetings for business, or professional, official, examination, or support reasons [21] . In addition to the measures enforced by law, further protection measures, like recommendations to reduce social contacts and to stay and work from home when possible, were published, particularly by the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) [22] .

To better illustrate the development of sound levels before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic in relation to the main sound sources, we defined and categorized new land use types based on LUT, photographs, and assessments of the respective recording sites. The selection was done separately by each member of our team. For example, we grouped mixed forests and deciduous forests as category 'urban forest' and 'residential area' with different building heights as category 'residential area'. We resolved disagreements through discussion between the team members. Most inconsistencies occurred between the 'residential area' and 'residential street'; in these cases, we assigned the locations to the original LUT. We also discussed 'urban agriculture' more often. This might be due to the special feature of the polycentric Ruhr Area that covers almost 40% of agricultural land, which results in these areas being often on the fringes of residential areas [24] . We classified one site as the 'main street' despite this site belonging to the 'commercial area' category according to the LUT of the RVR. The decision was reached because this site is located directly on the border between the LUT 'commercial area' and 'main street'; after examining photos and google maps, the main effect on noise levels is very likely caused by the main street with a tram line. Figure 1 depicts the land use categories, one photo as an example, and the number of respective monitoring stations per land use category. ",

Differences between the pre-and during lockdown phases were calculated as \u2206 = x d \u2212 x p , where x d represents the mean of the during lockdown phase and x p the mean of pre-lockdown phase. As the sound pressure index, we calculated the A-weighted mean dB values of the equivalent continuous sound level L Aeq , using the software Kaleidoscope Pro [25] . We calculated the mean L Aeq of all devices by day (referred to as L Aeq,24h ). Using the L Aeq,24h we describe the mean course of the noise levels for each day over the observation period as well as patterns of specific weekdays. Calculating the mean L Aeq of all devices for each of the two five-week periods pre-and during lockdown (referred to as LA eq,35d ), we conduct this pre-during comparison. To compare weekdays with weekends, we calculated the mean L Aeq of all devices separately for weekdays (Monday to Friday), Saturdays, and Sundays (referred to as L Aeq,week ). Lastly, we calculated the daily mean L Aeq per hour for all devices (referred to as LA eg,1h ) to analyze specific daytime differences. Unless otherwise noted, we performed statistical analyses using IBM SPSS Statistics 27.0.0.0. Figure 2 presents the overall daily average course of the L Aeq,24h during the observation period. Despite a high variance of the recordings, the course depicts a clear drop of the mean overall L Aeq , interestingly already starting before the administrative resolve. This early drop of the noise levels might be explained by press releases and intensive discussions on social media and TV about upcoming lockdown measures as already performed in other countries, i.e., in China. Furthermore, the health department of the city of Bochum recommended contact reductions as early as on 26 February 2020. Concerns of being infected and subsequent voluntary measures such as staying at home or using a home office started to reduced mobility prior administrative measures (s. Figure A2 of Appendix A). This can accordingly help to explain the downward trend around February 24. The peaks on Sundays on 16 and 23 February are thus not repeated afterwards, although smaller increases can still be seen, but they no longer happen on weekends either. This is possibly due to the fact that people have already reduced their leisure activities, which they otherwise pursued mainly on weekends. One exception is the week before the administrative lockdown showing a distinct increase in dB level. We assume that due to a lot of discussion in the media about suspected supply shortages, many people rushed to do final errands, which might have caused more noise. During the lockdown period, the fluctuation of noise levels between the days is not as pronounced as in the course of the pre-lockdown phase. A noticeable decrease of the noise level is observable between 21 March and 22 March, which could be linked to additional administrative restrictions on social contacts resolved on that day. The marked decline on April 10 is probably related to the Easter holidays, on which there were even more reduced office hours ( Figure A2 of Appendix A).",

We performed automated sound recordings at 22 locations selected based on different land use types. Our results reveal a distinct overall noise level reduction amounting to 5.1 dB, comparing mean daily L Aeq levels for five weeks before and five weeks during the SARS-CoV-2 induced administrative lockdown measures. We observed noise reductions in each land use category; however, the magnitude of the sound levels differed considerably between the categories. By far the least noise reductions were found in the category 'main street' with 3.9 dB, and the greatest reductions were found in 'urban forest', 'green space', and 'residential area', 5.9 dB each. Additionally, we observed that the circadian rhythm of the noise levels during 24 h did not generally differ between the pre-and during noise level courses. Only the noise level differed, owing to more noise in the pre-lockdown period.",

            "text": "Comparing previous studies from different European cities investigating the effects of lockdown measures on noise levels, it is striking that all studies report noise reductions in a very similar order of magnitude of 5 dB(A). Thus, our result fits well into this surprising observation. For instance, Bruitparif (2020) compared a 15-week lockdown lasting from 16 March 2020, to 28 June 2020, with a 14-month pre-lockdown reference period lasting from 1 January 2019, to 29 February 2020, in Paris, France [13] . They report mean noise reductions, indicated as L DEN , near high-speed roads and railways of 5.9 dB(A) and 5.3 dB(A). Noise reductions in neighborhoods turned out to be even higher, ranging between 6-20 dB(A). The \"Observatoire de l'environnement sonore de la M\u00e9tropole de Lyon\" reports results of 21 recording stations in five French cities (Lyon, Marseille, Grenoble, Saint Etienne, and Toulouse). They compared recordings 54 days during lockdown (17 March 2020, to 10 May 2020) and 69 days during a reference period lasting from 6 January 2020, to March 13, 2020 [10] . They observed a noise reduction of L DEN ranging on average between 4 and 6 dB(A); however, detailed descriptions of the time frame and the types of the selected locations are not provided. Data of 31 recording stations provided by the city council of Madrid, Spain revealed an average L DEN reduction of around 5 dB(A) during the lockdown period (76 days from 16 March 2020, to 31 May 2020) compared to the reference period (38 days from 1 February 2020, to 10 March 2020) [14] . Recordings from London, Great Britain, showed an average L Aeq reduction of 5.4 dB at 11 measurement points during lockdown in spring 2020 compared to recordings at the same locations from spring 2019 [15] . They also report a high spatial variance of L Aeq levels ranging between 1 to 10 dB. In Dublin, Ireland, Basu et al. (2020) [16] measured noise levels at 12 monitoring stations across the city, mainly near streets. Similar to our results, they report mean noise reductions of around 4 to 6 dB(A). This was also found in the city of Milan, Italy, where recordings from 24 stations measuring from 1 January to 21 June showed an average L DEN reduction of about 6 dB(A) compared to the same period in 2019 [26] . To our knowledge, there are only two studies so far reporting lower noise reductions. However, one study from Rumpler et al. (2020) [17] used the data of only one recording device. They reported a L Aeq reduction in the city of Stockholm, Sweden, of 2-3 dB, depending on the weekday. The other one from the United States measured an overall reduction of about 2.6 dB(A). However, this study used the data of individual noise exposures assessed by smartwatches and headphones of 5894 participants [27] . The study defined a baseline period from 8 January to 21 February 2020, that was compared to an intervention (lockdown) period, each set depending on the state from which the data were obtained. Sound levels (expressed as equivalent continuous average exposures, normalized to 8 h exposures) were computed from Apple Watch.",

In Germany, the visibly reduced number of cars was particularly striking on the roads, e.g., less individual traffic because of closed schools, kindergartens, and home offices. In fact, the so-called traffic barometer of the Federal Highway Research Institute in Germany concludes that a marked decrease in traffic was observed on federal highways and federal roads during the lockdown period [7] . The institute compared data from one month with both the previous month's and the same month's data from the previous year. Across all types of motor vehicles, a decrease of 18.6% is listed for March 2020 compared to February 2020 and a decrease of 20.5% compared to March 2019 [7] . Measurements on selected highway sections in North Rhine-Westphalia by Stra\u00dfen.NRW, a State Government Enterprise providing road development and maintenance services, indicate that the traffic volume the days after the lockdown reached a level of 30% compared to the same period in 2019 [30, 31] . Although specific traffic mobility data for the city of Bochum are not available, one can assume that traffic reductions across the Ruhr Region are similar.",

For instance, considering weekdays and weekends, the highest noise reductions occurred on weekends, strictly speaking on Sundays. This result is in line with results from Asensio et al. (2020) [14] , who found a greater reduction on weekends compared to weekdays. However, during the lockdown, Sundays turned out to be somewhat louder than Saturdays. This could be explained in that we not only measured in green areas, but also in residential areas as well as major and side streets, near where people reside. As during lockdown locations like leisure parks, zoos, gyms, or playing grounds were closed, many people have gone to other somewhat unorthodox places to just be outside, spending time, exercising, or playing with children-preferably avoiding large gatherings. An even more subtle temporal resolution by analyzing the course of noise levels by hourly time of day reveals further interesting results. Except in the early morning hours, the overall pattern of noise levels pre-and during lockdown proves surprisingly similar, despite being at a lower noise level during the lockdown observation period. The converging noise levels in the early morning hours might be simply due to birdsongs in that special time of spring. With lengthening daylight, songbirds start singing loudly again, attracting mates and so on. Different to the during lockdown period, sounds of birdsongs pre-lockdown did not play a role, as it was too early in spring by that time. Birds start singing one hour before sunrise, which in Germany is at about 6:45 a.m. around 16 March, explaining the peak around 5:00 and 6:00 a.m. quite reasonably. To the best of our knowledge, no other study reported circadian rhythm of sound levels before and during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Since our sound recordings are still ongoing, we will have the chance to verify this assumption fairly soon.",

The high temporal resolution as well as the long-term measurements are further strengths of this research. The systematic approach to gathering data from a wide range of urban acoustic environments while taking into account possible seasonal variances deserves mention.

Furthermore, wind can cause noise on building fa\u00e7ades as well as modify sound propagation, which changes sound pressure levels accordingly [32] [33] [34] . We cross-referenced meteorological wind data in Bochum to rule out the impacts of specific temporally delineated pressure systems that might have influenced wind gusts. However, these data are based on just one meteorological station. Thus, only major weather event could be taken into account, such as a strong storm between 10-11 February. Still, our results seem reasonable, since noise reductions of international studies had a similar range, and it would be unlikely that similar weather conditions were to have occurred by chance at all locations at different times. Most other studies cited here do not provide information on meteorological data. Only Bruitparif (2020) [13] mentions the exclusion of specific records of days with extreme weather events such as heavy rain and strong wind, and still reports very similar noise reduction levels. Lastly, if the reduction in noise levels were only due to lower wind speeds, then the noise reduction should actually have been more homogeneous over the different observed land uses types.",

Furthermore, as already mentioned above, most studies to date investigating the impact of Sars-CoV-2 on noise levels have measured decreases in very similar ranges (3-5 dB), regardless of comparing the same seasonal periods between 2019 and 2020 or the weeks before and during lockdown measures.

Although it seems reasonable to expect that the nationwide reported decreases of traffic volume are of corresponding size in Bochum, it would be desirable to have more accurate, small-scale traffic data to evaluate the effects of individual and public traffic reductions on noise levels in more detail. Our 22 recording sites already cover a wide range of urban land use types. Still more recording sites are desirable to represent the most specific places of a city available to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the urban acoustic environment.",

A reduction in traffic noise, as one main source of noise pollution [35] , as well as a transformation to health-promoting urban mobility by using alternative modes of transportation, can be an effective and promising approach to mitigating the negative health effects of noise in cities. The World Health Organization estimates that one million healthy life years are lost from traffic-related noise in the western part of Europe, every year (World Health Organization 2011). Our results are in concert with other international studies cited here, showing the potential to reduce noisy and unhealthy (urban) areas through reduction of traffic volume. Urban facilities and new transportation systems [36] that provide incentives for a shift away from traditional motorized traffic modes leading to less noise and air pollution [37, 38] are a promising avenue to improve urban public health. This is in line with new mobility concepts that aim to make cities more healthy, sustainable, and resilient. Overall, the experiences gleaned from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic offer data for best practices and policies for the development of urban transportation, in that experiences of a reduced-traffic, less noisy and thus more pleasant world could be experienced firsthand by people during this time, however without a pandemic breathing down our necks in the future.
