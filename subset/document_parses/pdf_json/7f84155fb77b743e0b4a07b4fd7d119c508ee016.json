Multiple off-label and investigational drugs, such as chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, have gained broad interest due to positive pre-clinical data and are currently used for treatment of COVID-19. However, some of these medications have potential cardiac adverse effects. This is important because up to one-third of patients with COVID-19 have cardiac injury, which can further increase the risk of cardiomyopathy and arrhythmias. Adverse effects of chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine on cardiac function and conduction are broad and can be fatal. Both drugs have an anti-arrhythmic property and are proarrhythmic. The American Heart Association has listed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as agents which can cause direct myocardial toxicity. Similarly, other investigational drugs such as favipiravir and lopinavir/ritonavir can prolong QT interval and cause Torsade de Pointes. Many antibiotics commonly used for the treatment of patients with COVID-19, for instance azithromycin, can also prolong QT interval. This review summarizes evidenced-based data regarding potential cardiac adverse effects due to off-label and investigational drugs including chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, antiviral therapy, monoclonal antibodies, as well as common antibiotics used for the treatment of COVID-19. The article focuses on practical points and offers a point-of-care protocol for providers who are taking care of patients with COVID-19 in an inpatient and outpatient setting. The proposed protocol is taking into consideration that resources during the pandemic are limited.",

[4] [5] [6] The mechanism may include severe systemic inflammatory responses, direct injury from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), hypoxia or microthrombi leading to microvascular damage. 7 However, adverse effects from pharmacotherapy cannot be entirely excluded. In addition, concomitant cardiac injury from SARS-CoV-2 infection may increase the risk of adverse events from generally safe drugs. 8 For instance, patients with cardiomyopathy and/or congestive heart failure have reduced repolarization reserve and are at increased risk of drug-related proarrhythmic risk. 8, 9 Other specific concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic may include lack of adequate cardiac testing giving a shortage of healthcare providers and ancillary staff, as well as the intention to minimize the risk of exposure. Finally, when using off-label medications to treat novel disease such as COVID-19, drug-drug interaction can be underestimated.",

Reports from long-term users with a smaller daily dosage found a broad prevalence of cardiac toxicity in the form of mild to severe conduction disorders and irreversible cardiomyopathy.

Other electrocardiographic changes may include T-wave inversion or depression. In healthy animal models, both agents, especially chloroquine, decreased excitability and conductivity of atrial and ventricular myocardium, although the magnitude is much less than quinine or quinidine, a related class I anti-arrhythmic drug. 14 Nonetheless, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have been shown to be effective in the acute suppression of wide ranges of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. 13 A study of 28 patients taking 250 mg daily of chloroquine found QT (Qtc) interval lengthened from 363-388 milliseconds to 372-392 milliseconds. 15 The dose recommended for the treatment of COVID-19 is 500 mg twice a day, therefore the risk of QT prolongation is expected to be higher. Furthermore, case reports of chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine toxicity observed widened QRS complex due to their excessive I Na blockage property. A study of 72 subjects with and without structural heart disease given acute chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine therapy for various types of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias observed one sudden death. 13 The dosage used in the study was slightly higher than that proposed in the treatment of COVID-19. Conclusively, the American Heart Association has listed chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as agents which can cause direct myocardial toxicity and exacerbate underlying myocardial dysfunction. 16 ",

The algorithms are in line with the recently published guidance from the Mayo Clinic 30 and from the American College of Cardiology magazine which focus solely on hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. 8 Our protocol has extended those statements by taking underlying cardiomyopathy into consideration, as well as covering other drugs currently used in the treatment of the pandemic. Generally, drugs with potential QT prolongation should be avoided in patients with QTc greater than 500 milliseconds (or 550 milliseconds with intraventricular conduction delay) especially in the setting of moderate to severe structural heart disease and patients with high-grade atrioventricular block without a pacemaker and/or implantable cardioverter defibrillator in place. 31, 32 In patients with baseline QTc greater than 500 milliseconds and normal or mild cardiomyopathy, benefit may outweigh the risk and shared decision-making should be discussed. The checklist shown in Figure 2 should be applied for all patients. This includes minimizing concomitant prolonging QT drugs and concomitant CYP3A4 inhibitors and substrates, and maintaining normal serum electrolyte levels. Bradycardia can precipitate TdP and thus conditions or medications with the potential to slow the heart rate should also be avoided. These following criteria should prompt dose reduction or drug discontinuation: subsequent QTc interval greater than 500 milliseconds (or 550 milliseconds with intraventricular conduction delay) in those with baseline QTc less than 500 milliseconds; DQTc greater than 60 milliseconds. 30,32 A preliminary report showed that the maximal change in the QT interval among patients with COVID-19 treated with combined hydroxychloroquine/azithromycin occurred between days 3 and 4. 33 Thus, in a setting with limited resources, QTc interval measurement may be performed on days 3-4.",

Providers should ensure patients' history without significant underlying cardiomyopathy or cardiac symptoms. If a recent 12-lead ECG is not available, a new baseline ECG should be obtained. In addition, liver function test, serum creatinine and serum electrolytes may be considered in patients at risk. Figure 4 presents the proposed monitoring protocol with an initial checklist.
