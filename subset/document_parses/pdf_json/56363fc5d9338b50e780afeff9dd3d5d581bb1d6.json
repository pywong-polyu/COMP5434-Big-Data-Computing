Many of the relevant questions simply do not fall neatly under traditional research areas of basic ecology, classical epidemiology, or vector biology (Parkes et al., 2005) , and tend to fare poorly in unsolicited grant applications at either of the supporting agencies. Both disease management and long-term predictive research use ecological information. Among ecologists, the rapid rise in this area of study has been nothing short of astounding. When the EID program began, at the annual meeting of the Ecological Society of America, one might find a handful of talks on the subject of disease ecology. Now, there are multiple contributed-paper sessions and symposia.

This lack of appreciation is due, in part, to a tendency to confuse such research with descriptive natural history and surveillance monitoring. However, increased recognition of the role of nonmedical events in influencing outbreaks of diseases such as SARS, the potential for bioterrorism, and the current global spread of avian influenza has added new urgency and made this a front-page issue. Recent trends in grant applications, government sponsored reports (e.g., Smolinski et al., 2003; Knobler et al., 2006) , and a talks at various conferences suggest that there is growing recognition of the potential power of predictive ecological research that involves multiple disciplines and may span multiple spatial scales in order to achieve a quantitative understanding of disease transmission mechanisms.

While substantial research exists on both the ecology and evolution of disease, almost none looks at the interaction of these processes, even though disease dynamics are happening in evolutionary time for microorganisms. What is the role of within-host ecology, including host-pathogen interactions and interactions among multiple pathogens? While disease ecology research is teasing apart the complexities of multiple hosts and vectors, nearly all focuses on just a single disease organism at a time. Can we develop truly useful predictive models for these complex ecological processes that are spatially and temporally explicit? This last is the ultimate question.

The questions posed above will likely result in a shift in the focus of proposals submitted to the EID program, for example, more projects that examine pathogen evolution.
