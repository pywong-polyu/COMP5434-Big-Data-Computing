The situation soon proved grave enough to warrant the declaration of a pandemic in March 2020 [1, 2] . In the face of this phenomenon, all countries, each at its own pace, made restrictive decisions about the control, hygiene and regulations governing social life in the new reality. To slow down the spread of the virus, most countries opted for radical measures that placed restrictions on the daily lives of millions of people across the world. Primary constraints concerned the maintenance of proper hygiene, social distancing and reduced mobility. Many countries recommended switching to a remote work mode when possible, which entailed prolonged confinement in the same place and promoted a sedentary lifestyle. As the situation drew on, many citizens experienced pandemic-induced stress, which affected their behavior and food choices, while simultaneously limiting their physical activity (PA) [3] .",

In all likelihood, the consequences of COVID-19 and the associated isolation will affect the model of life and differ from country to country in a manner determined by not only the epidemic situation but also such factors as the level of socio-economic development and the cultural background. A comparison between strikingly different countries will reveal whether the dietary habits have changed at all and highlight the differences between the examined countries in this respect. An analysis of the findings will provide an insight into the level of changes in health-related behavior. In this context, it will provide healthcare institutions with information important for the planning of prevention measures throughout the pandemic situation and upon its resolution.",

Validation involved cultural adaptation intended at intercultural comparison (the ability to compare findings of the questionnaire on the intercultural level) and the practical application of the questionnaire in the United Kingdom and Austria. To produce a tool that will assess certain characteristics in the United Kingdom and Austria with the highest possible accuracy, that tool must be developed in consideration of the local profile of the target country. Three versions-a Polish version, the translation (to German and English), and the back translation to Polish-were compared in terms of homogeneity, i.e., the criterion of functional equivalence. The assessment concerned the viability of using the questionnaires in German and English for the assessment of the same aims as the Polish version. The accuracy and reliability of the scale were assessed with statistical methods such as Cronbach's alpha and the correlations between the collected socio-demographic data and the findings obtained in individual areas and the entire test. Internal consistency was assessed with the test of the Cronbach's alpha coefficient and the discriminatory power of an item. The test indicated the Cronbach's alpha value at the level of approximately 0.8, which signifies that the answers obtained from the respondents are relatively similar, (Supplementary Materials Table S1 ).",

Firstly, the relationships were examined between answers for the period before and during the pandemic with the Wilcoxon test for dependent samples relying on the Z-statistic for p < 0.05 and at the \u03b1 = 0.05 significance level. Based on the resulting data and the analysis of regressive logistic model comparison based on the odds ratio, variables affecting the loss or gain of body mass were determined. Furthermore, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was conducted to assess the similarity of the observed counts and the predicted probability. Dietary behavior changes and the associated body mass gain included nine independent variables. For that purpose, a logistic regression analysis was conducted. The model quality was not high (R 2 Pseudo = 0.08, R 2 Nagelkerke = 0.14, and R 2 Cox-Snell = 0.11). Simultaneously, the model is statistically significant (p < 0.001 of the likelihood-ratio test), and thus the independent variables included in the model are statistically significant. Additionally, a Hosmer-Lemeshow test was also conducted that indicated a lack of significance p = 0.162, which is a desirable result as it implies the similarity between the observed counts and the predicated probability.",

Interestingly, upon the analysis of other dietary habit changes, the examined group exhibited more favorable food behaviors [3] . A greater number of homemade meals may bring immense health benefits since it allows one to fully control the ingredients of each meal. [23] . Furthermore, the preparation of homemade meals has more advantages than the potential benefits related to physical health. Mills et al.

In the case of sweets, cakes, cookies and confectionery products, 28.7% of the respondents declared reduced consumption, whereas 24.6% reported increased consumption [20] . In light of these observations, it is interesting to consider the findings of Husain et al. (2020) . Research conducted in Kuwait indicated that before the pandemic, 49% of the respondents consumed fast foods more frequently (1-2 times a week) and, during the pandemic, 82% refrained from eating such foods entirely [29] . Similarly, in Brazil, Steele et al. (2020) indicated a statistically significant, though small, increase in the frequency of consuming vegetables, fruit, beans and other legumes. In the entire cohort of participants, the indicators of unhealthy food habits have shown virtually no change in the face of the new situation [35] . Chang et al.

Other authors also noted this disquieting change. In Poland, G\u00f3rnicka et al. (2020) observed increased alcohol consumption in 18.1% of the respondents and Sidor et al. (2020) in 14.6% [5, 37] . In turn, Giacalone (2020) reported that the consumption of alcoholic drinks in Denmark rose by as much as 30.3% [33] ; an increased consumption of high alcohol content drinks was also reported in Lithuania [38] . This phenomenon may be the effect of the poor psychological condition of people forced to self-isolate. Isolation may have induced a feeling of helplessness and a lack of control over their situation, which amplifies stress-one of the factors inclining some consumers to drink alcohol [25] . It may be due to the synergistic effects of unemployment, stress from childcare or additional caregiving responsibilities. Zhang et al. (2020) demonstrated that, apart from the consumption of vitamin C, probiotics and other health products, the use of alcohol is one of the reported mechanisms of coping with the fear of the pandemic [31] .",

            "text": "The impact of the COVID-19 crisis on weight-related behaviors, including healthy dietary habits and physical activity, is unclear but may be significant [39] . Small body mass changes over relatively short periods may become permanent and, with time, lead to a significant body mass gain. Considering that the current situation may continue for at least several months, this prolonged home confinement may exacerbate the problem of obesity in adults, significantly contributing to the yearly body mass gain [40] . The current study revealed that the largest group of people reported an increase in body mass during pandemic ( Figure 3 ). Gender had no impact on the differences in body mass changes of the respondents. Nearly 40% of men and women declared a body mass gain. A similar relationship among women was reported by Drywie\u0144 et al., 2020, in which body mass gain was reported by 38% of the examined women and 44% of the obese women before the pandemic [41] . Furthermore, as many as 74% of underweight women lost weight during the pandemic. The findings may suggest that many unsuitable food behaviors may escalate during the pandemic. These findings are consistent with those obtained by Fernandez-Rio at al., who aimed to assess body mass changes of people in Spain during home confinement, and according to the results, most respondents declared no change (0 kg). Men and people with obesity exhibited greater body mass volatility, whereas the elderly showed greater stability [42] . Most of all, the problem of body mass gain concerned people under 50 years of age. Dietary habits of people under 50 may be less ingrained than those of the older ages, which makes them most susceptible to change during the pandemic. Additionally, it should be noted that part of the consumers included in the 50+ age category included people who were no longer professionally active. Thus, the pandemic did not affect their daily life as intensely as in the case of people who had to change their working model or their entire work organization (new security procedures, etc.). In Lithuania, it was observed that approximately one-third (31.5%) of the respondents gained weight and that this tendency was more common in people who were already overweight. An analysis of the multi-factor logistic regression demonstrated that greater chances of body mass gain were related to women of older ages [38] , which was not conclusively confirmed by the current findings. Interesting results were obtained by authors conducting research in Hubei Province, China. It was determined that people of normal body mass, who normally experience no problems with excess weight or obesity, exhibited weaker awareness of body mass gain than persons with BMI \u2265 24. In semi-lockdown conditions, they had a tendency to gain body mass [43] .",

            "text": "One of the unsettling elements observed during the pandemic, other than the foodrelated aspects, is a change in physical activity (PA). Our research shows that long-term isolation led to reduced PA and an intensification of the sedentary behaviors. There is a great deal of evidence justifying the adoption of PA promotion as a global priority in the area of public health during the COVID-19 pandemic [44] . Unfortunately, the pandemic limited the number of places where people could practice physical activity, since many countries prevented or limited access to common places of recreation, both indoors and outdoors. This situation found a reflection in the current research, which indicated a general reduction of physical activity during the time of COVID-19 restrictions in all the examined countries. The current findings complement similar studies on the role of physical activity in the United Kingdom [45, 46] , Austria [47] and Poland [38, 48] . A drop in physical activity during lockdown is corroborated by the findings of other authors who analyzed the levels of PA in other countries [49, 50] . According to Ong [51] , physical activity dropped by an average of 42% and the least active group accounting for~51% of the sample included younger and mainly single people. This group, which typically shows lesser activity, exhibited the largest drop of PA during the lockdown. These findings are corroborated by the research [52] , conducted on the Spanish population of adults. The study demonstrated that youth, students and highly active men especially reduced their daily reported PA during the COVID-19 lockdown. Caputo et al. [53] wrote an extensive review paper on the relationship between physical activity and the COVID-19 lockdown. Most evidence points to a drop in PA due to social distancing measures, even though in some studies from Italy [4] and Spain [54] , the participants generally reported an increase of activity during the lockdown. Good physical condition may also help reduce the mental health pressures related to the outbreak of COVID-19, which is an additional argument for the promotion of physical activity and sport at all ages during the isolation caused by the coronavirus.",
