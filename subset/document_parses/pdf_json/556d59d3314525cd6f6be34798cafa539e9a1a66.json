Objective: We sought to identify whether metformin reduced mortality from Covid19 and if sex specific interactions exist. Design: Retrospective review of de-identified claims from UnitedHealth Group's Clinical Discovery Database. Unadjusted and multivariate models were conducted to assess risk of mortality based on metformin and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u03b1) inhibitors as home medications in individuals with T2DM and obesity, controlling for comorbidities, medications, demographics, and state. Heterogeneity of effect was assessed by sex. Setting: The database includes all 50 states in the United States. Participants: Persons with at least 6 months of continuous coverage from UnitedHealth Group in 2019 who were hospitalized with Covid-19. Persons in the metformin group had > 90 days of metformin claims in the 12 months before hospitalization. Results: 6,256 persons were included; 52.8% female; mean age 75 years. Metformin was associated with decreased mortality in women by logistic regression, OR 0.792 (0.640, 0.979); mixed effects OR 0.780 (0.631, 0.965); Cox proportional-hazards: HR 0.785 (0.650, 0.951); and propensity matching, OR of 0.759 (0.601, 0.960). There was no significant reduction in mortality among men. TNF\u03b1 inhibitors were associated with decreased mortality, by propensity matching in a limited model, OR 0.19 (0.0378, 0.983).",

An overall mortality rate over 5% for all patients hospitalized with Covid-19 highlights the urgent need for treatments while vaccines are developed. 2 Observational data early in the outbreak identified male sex and increased age as leading risk factors in Covid-19. 3 Subsequent studies have identified hypertension, diabetes, coronary artery disease, tobacco use, and obesity as important risk factors for Covid-19 outcomes. 2, [4] [5] [6] Persons hospitalized with Covid-19 with overweight or obesity (body mass index, BMI\u226525kg/m 2 ) had a higher risk of needing mechanical ventilation, after controlling for diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. 6 Additionally, among individuals with Covid-19 and a BMI \u226528kg/m, 2 men have a higher risk of developing severe Covid-19 than women. 7 This sex difference may be explained by the accumulation of visceral adiposity at lower BMI levels in men. 8 Adipocytes, specifically visceral adipocytes, secrete many of the inflammatory and coagulopathic molecules that are implicated in Covid-19 morbidity, including interleukin-6 (IL-6), tumor-necrosis-factor\u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), d-dimer, and others. [9] [10] [11] [12] TNF\u03b1 has been particularly important, with high levels of TNF\u03b1 found in lung tissue of persons with Covid-19. 13 TNF\u03b1 contributes to insulin resistance, and levels of TNF\u03b1 are higher in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2DM). 14 Both T2DM and obesity are associated with lower levels of the anti-inflammatory cytokine, IL-10. 15 Metformin, the first-line medication for type 2 diabetes (T2DM) decreases TNF\u03b1 and IL-6, boost levels of IL-10, and has been found to cause these beneficial effects significantly more in females more than males. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] Metformin also increases activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which has important downstream effects in Covid-19. 16, 21, 22 .

We hypothesized that metformin would be associated with decreased mortality from Covid-19 in persons with T2DM or obesity, and that this benefit would be higher in women compared to men given metformin's sex-specific anti-inflammatory effects. We also hypothesized that TNF\u03b1 inhibitors would be associated with decreased mortality from Covid-19. We conducted a retrospective cohort analysis of de-identified claims data from UnitedHealth Group's Clinical Discovery Database of 6,256 persons hospitalized in the US with Covid-19 in 2020.",

[17] [18] [19] [20] We also found reduced mortality in persons with outpatient use of TNF\u03b1 inhibitors who were hospitalized for Covid-19. TNF\u03b1 inhibitor use was associated with large decreases in odds of mortality, but these findings were not statistically significant, likely because of the small sample size of 38. Reduced mortality in persons who use TNF\u03b1 inhibitors would support previous research that TNF\u03b1 plays a large role in the pathology of Covid-19. 30 TNF\u03b1 leads to macrophage activation and increased cytokine release, likely contributing to Covid-19 pathology. 31 We considered other (overlapping) mechanisms by which metformin could reduce the severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection: ACE2 receptor modulation (via AMPK), decreased cytokine release (IL6, TNF\u03b1, increased IL-10), improved neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, decreased glycemia (via AMPK), mast cell stabilization, decreased thrombosis, and improved endothelial function. [16] [17] [18] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] In patients with and without diabetes, metformin has been shown to decrease inflammatory mediators IL-6 and TNF\u03b1. 16, 43, 45 These effects are notable, as IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 are thought to contribute to Covid-19 pathology. 13 Metformin's effects on these cytokines have been shown to differ by sex, with favorable effects in female over male mice, particularly for TNF\u03b1. 18 Our findings of a strong sex-specific response to metformin in Covid-19 suggests that TNF\u03b1 reduction may be the primary way by which metformin reduced mortality from Covid-19.",

We found no significant mortality benefit in men with T2DM or obesity who were hospitalized with Covid-19. The sex-specific effects of metformin on TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10, and our findings of benefit in women, might indicate that metformin's protective effect in Covid-19 is primarily through effects on TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and IL-10. The importance of TNF\u03b1 in Covid-19 is supported by our finding that TNF\u03b1 inhibitor use was associated with decreased mortality from Covid-19. The fact that these outpatient medications convey benefit in patients hospitalized for Covid-19 is interesting because metformin is universally stopped at hospital admission, suggesting its protective effects begin prior to hospitalization.",

Over 34% of adults in the US have prediabetes, 54 yet it is highly under-diagnosed as over 90% of them are not aware that they do. 55 Thus metformin for prevention of Covid-19 may be reasonable as metformin may be indicated for many adults in the US anyway.

Prescriptions for outpatient use of metformin cannot be extrapolated to starting metformin at Covid-19 diagnosis or inpatient use. Retrospective analyses are subject to biases and unmeasured confounding. While multicollinearity among potential confounders makes interpreting their independent associations with in-hospital mortality potentially difficult, adjustments for these confounders is necessary to minimize bias for estimating the causal effect of home metformin use on inhospital mortality. 56, 57 Conclusion In a large de-identified claims database of adults with T2DM or obesity, metformin was associated with significantly decreased mortality in women hospitalized with Covid-19, with no significant mortality reduction in men. Mechanistic reasons that support a sex-specific reason for metformin to be protective in Covid-19 include anti-inflammatory effects on TNF\u03b1, IL-6, and possibly IL-10. We also found that TNF\u03b1 inhibitors were associated with reduced mortality, this finding was not significant in all models, likely due to the small sample size.
