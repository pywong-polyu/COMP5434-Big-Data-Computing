Aggregated NPs rather than individual NPs are generally required for sensing, electronics, and catalysis. However, the transformation of functional NP aggregates into scalable, controllable, and affordable functional devices remains challenging. Printing is a promising additive manufacturing technology for fabricating devices from NP building blocks because of its capabilities for rapid prototyping and versatile multifunctional manufacturing. This paper reviews recent advances in NP patterning based on the combination of self-assembly and printing technologies (including two-, three-, and four-dimensional printing), introduces the basic characteristics of these methods, and discusses various fields of NP patterning applications.",

When ink droplets containing suspended NPs dry on hydrophilic substrates, the suspended NPs gather and deposit along the edges of the original droplets as the water-based ink spreads over them, leading to the coffee-ring effect. 40 This phenomenon is caused by the flow imbalance of the droplet system during drying. The higher surface-to-volume ratio at the droplet edge causes the solvent to evaporate faster than at the droplet center, resulting in an outward flow from the center to the edge, carrying the dispersed NPs to the fixed three-phase contact line (TCL). 41 Previous studies described inks composed of binary solvent mixtures that produce different evaporation rates. Fast-evaporating solvents have the highest proportion in the center, while slow-evaporating solvents are highest in proportion at the edges, resulting in surface tension driven (Marangoni) recirculating flows. 38, 42, 43 This flow can prevent the formation of coffee rings and ensure ll",

[6] [7] [8] The assembled functional NPs are transformed into functional devices for specific applications, such as ultrasensitive sensing and integrated circuit design. These applications require tailoring the two-dimensional (2D) patterns, three-dimensional (3D) architectures, or four-dimensional (4D) dynamically transformed structures of custom-assembled NPs. Traditional thin-film manufacturing methods, such as casting, Langmuir-Blodgett, and doctor blading, only enable NPs be stacked in disorder. [9] [10] [11] Printing technologies can perform elaborate patterning and well-defined positioning. [12] [13] [14] Therefore, a hybrid strategy combining NP assembly and printing processes can adequately overcome this challenge. The advantage of this strategy is that it allows functional NPs with different controlled shapes, thicknesses, resolutions, and layouts to maximize their potential for specific applications. Thus, printing assembly is not only a tool for patterning but also a support tool for new applications and industrialization. NP patterning has been employed in nanosensing, energy-storage devices, and photodetectors. For example, plasmonic NPs are generally used as Raman, infrared, and fluorescence amplification materials to recognize biological proteins and cancer cells. 15, 16 Metal oxide NPs have been used as energy conversion materials to greatly improve the photoelectric conversion efficiency of solar cells. 17 This review focuses on recent advances in various fabrication methods for forming large-area NP patterning based on 2D, 3D, and 4D printing assemblies ( Figure 1 ). The advantages and disadvantages of parallel printing assembly techniques for NPs are evaluated and summarized. Additionally, nanoinks based on different nanomaterials have been used for printing assemblies. Finally, the applications of NP patterning produced using printing assembly technology are reviewed. This review aims to deepen the understanding of the printing assembly technologies of functional NPs and to provide new ideas for multidisciplinary research.",

Inkjet printing assembly is a simple, fast, and universal technology for the formation of microscale high-resolution patterns with a variety of nanomaterials. 32 The NP ink is extruded into tiny nozzles by voltage-controlled pressure, and then naturally drops onto the substrate. 33 Then, the ink droplets dry on the substrate and the NPs are assembled (Figure 2A) . This technology enables a low-cost and efficient arrangement of droplets on the microscale, allowing precisely controlled deposition of small amounts of NPs. Moreover, owing to its advantages of arbitrary design and large-scale preparation, this technology has become a widely used method for manufacturing high-performance electrodes and multi-channel sensors. 34, 35 Many challenges still exist in controlling the quality of the printed pattern, including the viscosity and surface tension of the NP ink and the wettability of the printing substrate. 36 The nozzle diameter is generally 10-30 mm. To avoid clogged nozzles, the diameter of the NPs should not be larger than that of the nozzle. In order to obtain an accurate NPs pattern, it is necessary to adjust the ink properties so that the ink drops drop vertically at the specified position ( Figure 2B ). 33 The inverse Ohnesorge number, Z, is commonly used to characterize the fluid properties and ink printability, as expressed in Equation 1: 37",

Screen-printing assembly refers to the uniform spread of NP ink on the substrate to form an NP pattern using a screen as a template. 46 This process usually involves three steps ( Figure 2D ); namely, the ink is evenly painted onto the substrate using a screen; the ink penetrates the screen window and laminates on the target substrate; and the screen template is removed after the ink dries. Plate and roll-to-roll printing are the two main screen-printing modes. Zhang et al. used screen-printing technology to print NPs ink containing multiple layers of MXene to prepare devices, including miniature supercapacitors, conductive rails, and integrated circuits, as shown in Figure 2E . 39 Roll-to-roll printing presses ink onto a substrate through a polyester mesh cylinder and perforated metal. This technology can be used to produce numerous identically patterned arrays in one step. Ko et al. demonstrated a flexible all-solid supercapacitor with a flexible silver NP current collector. 47 The ink should have a certain viscosity to prevent ink leakage on the design screen template. 48 The thickness of the pattern (d; mm) produced by screen printing is mainly controlled by the window area of the screen (A; m 2 ); deposition yield (K d ); and the density (r; kg/m 3 ), concentration (c; kg/m 3 ), and volume (V; mL) of the ink, as expressed in Equation 2:",

It is expected to replace traditional lithography technology and become an important means of processing microelectronics and materials. The NIL preparation process for the assembly of NPs is shown in Figure 3A . The NIL assembly typically drops NP ink onto the substrate, which is then pressed onto the ink using a rigid pattern template. As the solvent evaporates, the NPs are assembled to form a pattern. 26, 49 Neretina et al. reported a hybrid strategy based on NIL and gas-phase assembly to form periodic seed arrays, which were driven by liquidphase plasma mediation and photostimulation to produce periodic arrays of hexagonal gold nanosheets ( Figure 3B ). 50 Kraus et al. directly nanoimprinted metal nanowires as a conductive metal mesh to produce conductive materials with adjustable properties. The mechanical properties were significantly better than those of commercial indium tin oxide. 51 NIL assembly is a powerful tool for achieving elaborate patterns. However, residual NPs can remain on the template after processing, resulting in pattern defects. A polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS)-based elastomer stamp template is used to remove structural defects. Liz-Marzan et al. reported that the PDMS template-assisted assembly of gold NPs (AuNPs) realized hexagonal stacked supercrystals with a period of 400 nm and an area of 0.5 cm 2 ( Figure 3C ). 52, 53 These regular 2D supercrystals exhibited well-defined collective plasmon modes that could be tuned from visible to near-infrared (NIR) by simple changes in the lattice parameters.",

The combination of superparamagnetic and plasmon properties can switch the infrared transmission of the mixed nanorods suspension by the application of an external magnetic field. 54 The main disadvantage of NIL assembly is the need for primitive mother templates with nanoscale dimensions and specific shapes, which generally require inefficient and expensive top-down lithography methods. To solve this problem, ordered nanostructures have been successfully used to fabricate NIL templates. Anodic alumina films with hexagonal nanopore arrays are an attractive alternative. 55 Additionally, the mother template is usually used less than 50 times and has a short life. mCP assembly. mCP is a micromachining technique for picking and placing NPs onto a target substrate to form a pattern using a soft elastic stamp. 56 The combination of mCP and self-assembly technology can achieve a patterned NP array. 57 The technology can be processed on different types of target substrates, making this a room-temperature, simple, and low-cost process. mCP assembly can be divided into three types according to the transfer mode, namely additive, subtractive, and intaglio transfer, as shown in Figures ",

It is worth noting that the quality of NP self-assembly determines the quality of the final pattern during the transfer process. Alexander et al. first assembled AuNPs on a soft PDMS template by electrostatic interaction. 58 Then, poly(ethylene imine) surface-decorated wrinkled stamps were employed to contact the template to form gold nanolattices. Owing to the independent tunability of the orientation between the stamp and the target substrate, NP arrays with different geometric shapes could be directly formed. mCP assembly has been successfully demonstrated in several practical applications. Nanocube dimers were obtained using the mCP method. The surface-enhancement Raman spectroscopy (SERS) signal was significantly enhanced by this structure. 59 The advantages of this technology, such as low cost, ease of operation, universality, and lower costs due to material savings, have stimulated interest in creating high-resolution patterns. However, most stamps consist of hydrophobic PDMS, which is easily swelled by polar solvents and cannot be wetted by watersoluble inks. Additionally, any distortion of the stamp affects the printed pattern and reduces reproducibility. These problems limit the application scope of mCP.",

            "text": "Dip-pen assembly. Dip-pen nanolithography (DPN) is a technology based on atomic force microscope (AFM) for direct writing with cantilevers. 61 The technology has high resolution (nanometer level) and can be combined with NPs (such as metals, colloid, organic, semiconductor, and biological) to assemble and construct high-performance patterned arrays. [61] [62] [63] The DPN preparation process for NP assembly is generally divided into four steps, namely dip coating, solvent evaporation, humidity adjustment, and assembly patterning. 60 First, the NP ink is coated on the AFM tip and transmitted through the meniscus to the substrate. The contact interface between the tip and substrate forms a condensed water meniscus, which is regarded as the NP ink transfer channel. The NPs are then patterned by a computer, which controls the motion of the tip. 64 The pattern quality for NP assembly is mainly controlled by the transport process, which is generally divided into three stages: (1) dissolution, in which the NP ink is dissolved at the tip and is transferred to the meniscus. The activation energy of the meniscus controls the dynamics of the NP transport process, and the ink coverage on the tip determines the transfer rate of the NP ink; 65, 66 (2) 69 Phospholipids and cholesterol were added to the NP ink as the transfer medium. The NP ink was assembled under the interaction of Laplacian forces and surface tension to obtain a high-resolution (4 nm) NP composite pattern. Moreover, Saha et al. proposed a model capable of directly predicting feature sizes from parameters such as the meniscus, tip, and surface. 70 DPN assembly technology has a high resolution, low cost, and a wide range of inks. Moreover, DPN assembly can be combined with polymer pen lithography and beam pen lithography cantilevered techniques to fabricate many types of NP structures owing to the multiplex and high-throughput preparation. [71] [72] [73] Although DPN technology has made good progress, some challenges still remain. For example, the spatial resolution of DPN-assembled NP patterns is limited by the meniscus surface, curvature radius of the tip, and the nanoreactor. Moreover, the printing area is usually small. 62 Evaporative lithography assembly. Evaporative lithography assembly is a method for fabricating well-defined nanostructures induced by capillary forces. Vakarelski et al. first reported a nanosphere array as a template to guide AuNPs to form a liquid-bridge network between the nanospheres and substrate. 74 The AuNP patterned scale is controlled by surfactants. Furthermore, a well-controlled method for rectangular, honeycomb, and hexagonal topological structures was developed using a cylindrical top arch template. 75 Song et al. investigated the effect of regulating the wettability of patterned substrates using evaporative lithography assembly. The droplets wet the entire microcolumn on the high-viscosity hydrophilic silicon substrate and exhibited a typical Wenzel state. After the liquid gradually decreased, NPs were deposited on the top and side of the column. The droplets displayed a non-wetting state on the superhydrophobic microcolumn, and the NP droplets only adhered to the top of the substrate, showing a Cassie state. Droplets tend to evaporate and crystallize at the top of the column on a highly viscous substrate; therefore, superhydrophobic substrates with high adhesion were used as candidate substrates for pattern preparation. To meet a wide range of applications, the obtained nanostructures are generally transferred to the desired substrate. Wu et al. developed a sandwichshaped system that directly prints nanopatterns onto a desired substrate. 76 A D E C B ",

[78] [79] [80] This technology superimposes 2D patterns to form a 3D structure. 3D printing procedures typically involve modeling, slicing, printing, and post-processing ( Figure 5A ). 81 It has been reported in recent years that complex 3D architectures can be generated from a variety of materials, such as polymers and NPs. Among the materials that can be used for 3D printing, NPs (for example, nanowires, graphene, and QDs) are the most suitable for further research because the assembly arrangement of NPs has great potential to improve structural properties. The electric, light, and magnetic fields are the main driving fields for adjusting the state of the NPs. Additionally, NPs with different morphologies have been designed to improve the 3D printing resolution and manufacturing speed. For example, zero-dimensional (0D) QDs in printed structures affect the visibility or color of the pattern. 1D nanowires in a specific printing direction can improve the electrical conductivity. 2D nanosheets can transform the surface tension of topological structures, thus changing the wettability. 11 This section analyzes the principles and development prospects of 3D printing assembly technology, and further describes how to drive the alignment of NPs in 3D printing assembly by means of light, electric, mechanical, and magnetic fields. The 3D printing assembly methods for the arrangement of NPs are mainly divided into three categories: stereolithography (SLA) based on reduction polymerization, deposition molding based on extrusion printing, and powder bed fusion (PBF).",

For example, Yang et al. manipulated the shear rate to align and assemble graphene nanosheets during the 3D printing process, which enhanced the mechanical and electrical conductivity of the assembled structures. 96 Under a magnetic field, magnetic NPs not only can affect the assembly process during 3D printing but can also provide directional transportation and remote control to the assembled devices.

[119] [120] [121] [122] Mazali et al. constructed a paper-based SERS platform using NP ink printing, and a very low analyte concentration of 2 mL could be detected. 123 There was a good linear relationship between the SERS intensity and analyte concentration. Additionally, the sensor has good repeatability and high stability. Screen-printing assembly, compared with inkjet printing assembly, is more compatible with the physicochemical properties of inks and the sizes and types of NPs in them. MOFs have the ability to capture guest molecules because of their porosity, and are commonly used for volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing. Our group reported the incorporation of hollow cobalt-nickel layered MOF nanocages on silver nanowires into an array by screen-printing technology. 124 This array exhibited an excellent gas absorption performance and could detect human VOCs, as shown in Figure 7A . The team used Raman B, G, and R values to produce a unique barcode that could detect aldehyde concentrations. Smart devices (such as smartphones, smartwatches, and scanners) can quickly read information in these barcodes, enabling visual sensing for early disease diagnosis ( Figure 7B ).",

Keller et al. printed polystyrene NPs on silicon, glass, and paper substrates. 130 The three-color palette for surface printing exhibited angular dependence and high visibility, making it legible even in daylight. Using an elaborate design, a simple pattern with red flowers and green leaves was constructed using two NPs with different particle sizes. Patterns responsive to environmental changes were constructed using stimulation-responsive polymer NPs and showed different colors in different gas concentrations. 131 This gas sensor responded up to 100 times faster than conventional PC sensors owing to the small volume of the printed ink droplets.

This strategy can provide power for diverse electronic products and will benefit the preparation and application of high-performance retractable batteries. Xue et al. loaded AuNPs onto a 3D conductive skeleton using inkjet printing. Silver NPs, as heterometal seeds, formed zincophilic alloys with Zn, which not only improved the thermal conductivity of the carbon matrix but also guided the uniform nucleation of Zn and avoided dendrite growth, thus obtaining a high-temperature-resistant and foldable Zn battery. 137 A high degree of integration is essential for portable wearable smart products.

Wireless inductive coupling enables the wireless analysis of the hemodynamics of bionic brain aneurysms with a maximum reading distance of 6 cm across the flesh (Figure 8E ). This study demonstrated the potential of printed biological systems for the battery-free, real-time wireless monitoring of cerebral aneurysm blood flow.

A solar cell powered the sensor and drove the LED indicator to alarm. The supercapacitors acted as photovoltaic energy-storage units to provide power to functional devices during intermittent lighting. The supercapacitors printed with mixed ink provided a high surface capacitance of 12.9 mF cm \u00c02 , a high specific energy density of 4.5 mWh cm \u00c03 , and a power density of 7.2 W cm \u00c03 .

Recently, Wu et al. demonstrated that printable MXene inks can be used to create MXene-based supercapacitors and lithium-ion batteries. 140 The supercapacitors connected in series provided a record voltage of 60 V. The quasi-solid batteries exhibited a surface energy density of 154 mWh cm \u00c02 . Additionally, the fully flexible self-powered system was prepared by integrating the solar cell, lithium-ion batteries, and MXene hydrogel pressure sensors. The integrated system responded to body deformation (i.e., bending of the finger and elbow and pressing vertically) in only 35 ms. Zhang et al. prepared a micro-supercapacitor using a monolayer MXene nanosheet through screen printing. 141 An area capacitance of 158 mF cm \u00c02 and an energy density of 1.64 mWh cm \u00c02 was achieved, which is significantly better than other MXenebased capacitors. 8 Wu et al. constructed a flexible supercapacitor by screen printing. Reduced graphene oxide and manganese hexacyanoferrate active materials were used as inks. The device exhibited the characteristics of on-demand design, bending resistance, high energy density, and strong stability, providing a simple, highly efficient, low-cost, and feasible method for the preparation of high-performance wearable flexible electronic equipment.",

            "text": "Photodetectors. Photodetectors convert optical signals into electrical signals, usually in the form of current or voltage. 142, 143 It is important for photodetectors to be sensitive to light intensity and spectral response speed. In addition to changing material properties, constructing micro-nano arrays is also a very effective method to improve light intensity sensitivity. Tawfique et al. demonstrated the use of black phosphorus as an ink to print photodetectors. 37 The coffee-ring effect was inhibited by inducing a circulating Marangoni flow and maintaining excellent uniformity. Because of the rapid drying of the ink, the oxidation produced by printing was minimal. The printed device could be used for the passive switching of ultrafast lasers, which remained stable under intense irradiation and was also applied to photodetectors with high response to NIR visibility. Wu et al. obtained a stable 1D a-FAPBI 3 perovskite structure with high crystallinity and ordered crystal orientation using evaporative lithography assembly. 144 This 1D structure inhibited trap density and high crystallinity. This photodetector showed an average response rate of 5,282 A W \u00c01 , an average specific detection rate of more than 1.45 3 10 14 Jones, and a 3-dB bandwidth of 15 kHz. This patterned technique is only applied to a single system, and restricts the fabrication of multi-materials, heterogeneous structures, and integrated devices. Wu et al. developed an effective strategy for guiding the crystallization of PbI 2 into microplates in capillary bridges using evaporative lithography assembly. 145 By controlling the position, size, and orientation of PbI 2 by capillary bridge, complex patterns such as Latin characters and Arabic numerals can be obtained. The patterns also have an excellent photoelectric performance with a responsivity of 625 mA W \u00c01 . The technology also allowed the integration of PbI 2 and poly(3-hexylthiophen-2,5-diyl) (P3HT) for organic/inorganic heterojunction arrays to further improve device performance. The construction of the patterned structure not only improved the photoelectric performance but also further controlled the structural crystallinity, preferred orientation, and polycrystalline processes. Homogeneous QD NPs tend to self-assemble to form superstructures, which greatly expands the diversity of patterned structure fabrication. Bao et al. uniformly printed perovskite films using the inkjet printing method, enabling the large-scale manufacturing of multi-channel detector arrays. The X-ray photodetector could detect very low X-ray dose rates, indicating that perovskite QDs are ideal candidates for X-ray detection. 146 Sargent et al. developed an efficient and sensitive PbS QD photodetector using the inkjet printing method. 147 The designed colloidal ink was stable within an ejectable window without affecting surface passivation. Moreover, photodetectors obtained using this strategy exhibited the highest specific detection rates reported to date (above 10 12 Jones in NIR). Shorubalko et al. constructed an infrared photodetector using the EHD method to print colloidal PbS QDs onto graphene field-effect transistors. 148 The technology has accurate positioning and high resolution, and is suitable for manufacturing micro-photodetectors. Notably, the responsivity of the photodetector reached at least 10 9 Jones at 1,200 nm. The responsivity of the device can be increased by thickness up to 130 nm without affecting the noise current. Most inorganic non-metallic printable materials have the advantages of controllable deposition and chemical stability. However, fluidity issues exist, including fluidity, non-clogging, and storable dispersity.",
