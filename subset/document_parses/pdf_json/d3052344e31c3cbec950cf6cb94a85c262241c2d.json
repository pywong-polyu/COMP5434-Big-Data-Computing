GPs have radically changed their work patterns during this period. 4 On 19 March 2020, a letter from NHS England asked all GP practices to adopt a full triage model supporting remote patient management. 5 Additionally, NHS England asked GP practices to manage home visits in designated premises and set up video consultations. 5 Concurrently, as the COVID-19 death toll climbed, some hospitals reported 44% of their staff testing positive for COVID-19. 6 The prevalence of COVID-19 among GPs was not well documented. Characteristics of patients who were high-risk were identified, 7 showing a disproportionate death rate among patients from BAME groups. 8 Importantly, the Office for National Statistics reported that the BAME population is up to four times more likely to die from COVID-19. 9 Consequently, Public Health England (PHE) issued guidance on risk assessing healthcare professionals (but alarmingly did not include recommendations to mitigate risks for the highrisk BAME NHS workers). 10 Nevertheless, local workplaces adopted pragmatic modifications to work patterns. 11 Additionally, this pandemic and the added isolation of a national lockdown has caused undue mental stress, 12 with increased suicide rates in the general population. 13 Perceived stress is the culmination of individual feelings or thoughts about how much stress one is under at a given point or time period. 14 Thus, GPs who are already known to have a stressful vocation 15 may be prone to worsening mental health issues as a result of this pandemic.",

GP mental wellbeing was explored using the Perceived Stress Scale. 16 Method This was a cross-sectional, retrospective questionnaire-based study. GPs across Leicestershire were invited to take part voluntarily. A 29-item survey using SmartSurvey software was designed with multiple choice and Likert response scale questions. The validated Perceived Stress Scale 16 was used to evaluate stress prior to COVID-19 (March 2020) and currently at the time of survey circulation (July-August 2020). Responses regarding stress levels prior to COVID-19 and during the COVID-19 pandemic were completed during the time of the study period.",

Importantly, 79.3% of GPs felt supported by their practice and 62.2% stated 'good' or 'excellent' preparation for the second wave. However, only 43.3% rated the access and availability to PPE as 'good' or 'excellent', suggesting room for improvement in providing this for the second wave. Strikingly, only 59.5% felt supported with mental health, with the validated stress tool indicating that GPs were stressed more often during the COVID-19 pandemic compared with the pre-COVID-19 time. Several qualitative comments were included in the results. This indicates that further support is required for GPs for this second wave of the pandemic.",

However, a future survey incorporating a larger radius would greatly strengthen the study. Limitations include the qualitative nature of this survey. A high proportion of BAME GPs responded, which may include bias in the results for mental wellbeing because of the current evidence on the adverse impact of COVID-19 on BAME doctors. 8 Additionally, specific diagnostic criteria for COVID-19 were not included in the survey. Self-reporting may result in inaccurate prevalence estimations. Another limitation was that this study was conducted in a city that was in an extended lockdown which -although it provides evidence for the impact of lockdown -may not be representative of the total GP population. Lastly, the design of this survey and potential ambiguity of some questions may have caused confusion in responses. This study will aid the development of better-designed surveys in the future.",

This may also reflect the increased testing from the local Leicestershire lockdown. Other contributory factors may be the large BAME proportion of responders in Leicestershire, 20 as ethnic group has been linked to COVID- 19, 8 and that 40.1% of the medical force in the NHS are BAME. 21 The results from this survey suggest that video and telephone consultations are the new way of working. The technology-based consultations have superseded the previous norm of face-to-face consultations and home visits ( Table 2 ). These findings were in line with the NHS England guidance released in March 2020. 5 Since then, the British Medical Association (BMA) 22 and NHS England 23 have produced clear guidance reiterating that remote consultations should be used when appropriate and home visits should be limited. Interestingly, the King's Fund had produced a model on using digital technology and video consultations in 2018. 24 Ironically, GPs who were resistant to accept this at the time, 25 have now embraced this technology as a result of this pandemic.",
