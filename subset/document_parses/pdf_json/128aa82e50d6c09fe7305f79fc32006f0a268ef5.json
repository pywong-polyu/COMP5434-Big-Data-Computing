With all three vaccines, there were generally stable antibody-dependent cellular phagocytosis and antibody-dependent complement deposition responses (Fig. S3) .",

As shown in previous studies, 1,2 the BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273 vaccines were characterized by high peak antibody responses that declined sharply by 6 months; these responses declined further by 8 months. Antibody titers in recipients of the mRNA-1273 vaccine were generally higher than those in recipients of the BNT162b2 vaccine. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine induced lower initial antibody responses, but these responses were relatively stable over the 8-month follow-up period, with minimal-to-no evidence of decline. 3 These findings have important implications for waning vaccine immunity, although correlates of protection from SARS-CoV-2 are not yet defined. Ai-ris Y. Collier, M.D. Shown are immune responses after vaccination with BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and Ad26.COV2.S at peak immunity (2 to 4 weeks after the second dose in recipients of the messenger RNA vaccines or 4 weeks after one dose in recipients of the Ad26.COV2.S vaccine) and at 6 months, 8 months, or both after the first dose. Panel A shows the serum 50% inhibitory dilution (ID 50 ) titers in the live-virus neutralizing antibody assay. Red bars indicate medians, dashed lines the limit of detection for each assay, and each dot a single participant. Panel B shows the serum dilution for 50% reduction (NT 50 ) expressed in relative light units in the pseudovirus neutralizing antibody assay. Panel C shows the binding IgG antibody titers against the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the serum enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Intracellular cytokine-staining assays were performed to measure the percentage of interferon-\u03b3 production in T cells; Panel D shows this percentage in CD4+ T cells, and Panel E shows this percentage in CD8+ T cells. Flow cytometric gating was performed to identify T cells (which are CD3+) rather than other CD4+-or CD8+-expressing immune cells. All assays were performed with the use of the SARS-CoV-2 WA1/2020 strain. The Ad26.COV2.S vaccine data in Panels B through E were published previously 3 and are included here for comparative purposes.",
