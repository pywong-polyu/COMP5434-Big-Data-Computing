In much of the Northern Hemisphere, the academic year begins in September, and for many countries, September 2020 marked the return to full schooling after some period of enforced closure due to COVID-19. In this paper, we focus on the airborne spread of disease and investigate the likelihood of transmission in school environments. It is crucial to understand the risk airborne infection from COVID-19 might pose to pupils, teachers, and their wider social groups. We use monitored CO 2 data from 45 classrooms in 11 different schools from within the UK to estimate the likelihood of infection occurring within classrooms regularly attended by the same staff and pupils. We determine estimates of the number of secondary infections arising via the airborne route over pre/ asymptomatic periods on a rolling basis. Results show that, assuming relatively quiet desk-based work, the number of secondary infections is likely to remain reassuringly below unity; however, it can vary widely between classrooms of the same school even when the same ventilation system is present. Crucially, the data highlight significant variation with the seasons with January being nearly twice as risky as July. We show that such seasonal variations in risk due to changes in ventilation rates are robust and our results hold for wide variations in disease parameterizations, suggesting our results may be applied to a number of different airborne diseases.",

In an effort to contain the spread of the virus, the UK, along with many other nations, implemented lockdown measures including a \"stay at home\" order from March 2020, causing most public spaces to close. This led to schools closing, for all but children of key workers and children within certain These, along with their respective mitigation strategies, are detailed and discussed in a number of papers including. 3 We focus herein on relatively far-field (>2 m) airborne transmission where small infected respiratory droplets and aerosols remain suspended in the air where they can be transported by indoor air currents and inhaled. It is thought that this route may be significant in the spread of COVID-19, with growing evidence showing that it played a role in well-documented outbreaks: for example in the case of the Skagit Valley Chorale event for which Miller et al. 4 show that aerosol transmission has to be considered in order to account for the extensive resulting number of cases. While measures such as social distancing and appropriate cleaning procedures will reduce the risk linked to the droplet and contact routes, infections due to airborne transmission may be harder to contain. They require, along with other measures, 5 the appropriate use of ventilation as recommended by the WHO 6 but, as described by Bhagat et al., 7 the physics of indoor flows are complex, and thus, the consistent provision of clean air at appropriate rates to all desired locations within indoor spaces remains a scientific and engineering challenge.",

We assume, as is currently required, that anyone showing any symptoms ceases attending school. We further assume that staff and students spend the vast majority of their school day in the classroom and thus infer that the risk of airborne infection is dominated by their time in the classroom which is currently likely to be the case in most schools, with break times being taken outdoors (minimal airborne infection risk) or within the classroom in inclement weather. We therefore calculate the likely consequences of airborne infection, the number of secondary infections, for pre/asymptomatic periods where the original infector continues to regularly attend the space, which, in this instance, is a classroom. The pre/asymptomatic period may be especially significant, as it corresponds to the period where infectivity is thought to reach a peak. 11 This approach is particularly applicable to primary schools (5-11 years old) where the same group of students can be assumed to attend the same classroom every day. It also remains suitable for secondary schools in which strategies have been implemented to reduce mixing between students, introducing, for example, fixed bubbles or groups of students in one classroom.",

However, for regularly attended spaces, for example, a school classroom, it is reasonable to assume that once an infected individual exhibits symptoms they cease attending. Thus, one can assess the likelihood of infection occurring during the pre/ asymptomatic infectious period, assuming the infector ceases to attended once symptoms develop.

Hence, in order to employ (2) it is not required to assume that all of the air within the classroom is well-mixed but it is required to assume that the infected breath is evenly mixed within the rebreathed air.",

With the new academic year 2020-2021 and the ongoing attempts to rekindle the economy, UK schools reopened in September 2020. The occupancy of the same spaces by staff and students over long durations throughout the working week makes it a crucial space in which to determine the risk that COVID-19 might present to the millions of pupils and, through transmission, their families and social groups, around the country. It is especially important to understand how this risk might vary under different conditions, notably changes in the seasons and the approach of winter, where time spent indoors can be expected to increase. Although children seem to be less likely to become seriously ill from COVID-19, it is known that they can still get infected 1 and so increase the chance of spreading the virus to more susceptible members of the population, including teachers and elderly relatives. Most COVID-19 transmissions are thought to happen indoors (as shown, e.g. by Quian et al., 2 with the analysis of hundreds of outbreaks in China) through three routes: the droplet (or spray) route, the contact (or touch) route, and the airborne (or aerosol) route.",

CO 2 variations within an indoor space such as a classroom and the related judicious placement of monitoring sensors remain a challenging problem worthy of further investigation. In most settings, CO 2 measurements must remain unobtrusive, and thus, placing sensors on walls is a sensible choice. This means that direct measurements of the exhaled breath are avoided along with their complications, detailed, for example, by Melikov & Kaczmarczyk 14 and Kierat et al. 15 Sensors should ideally placed far away from windows or other openings, and, crucially to study infection risk, they should also remain within the height where occupants breathe in. In this study, our data come from classrooms within each of which a single CO 2 sensor was placed at a height within the breathing zone, which was deemed suitable to ensure ventilation control. The impact of the exact location of the sensor is further increased by the choice of a constant and uniform concentration of CO 2 and the calculation of secondary infections.

Estimates of quanta generation rates havebeen made via a variety of methods for a host of airborne diseases. Understandably, for SARS-CoV-2, choices are limited but we apply the values reported in the work of Buonanno et al. 17 who consider the likely values of q based on viral load and respiratory activity. As a value which we deem to be typically appropriate for school classrooms, we take a value of q = 1 quanta/h-this is obtained by taking c x = c i c v \u2248 7 x 10 6 RNA/ml, where c i = {0.1,0.01} is the ratio between infectious quantum and the infectious dose expressed in viral RNA copies, and c v = {7 x 10 7 , 7 x 10 8 } RNA/ml is the viral load measured in sputum. These values assume that, for most of the time within school classrooms, the students are sitting breathing with perhaps a small number vocalizing: the data for whispered counting fall between these two activities and are closer to breathing. As such, for our base case, we take data for whispered counting from Buonanno et al. 17 and use their results to map our selected values of c x to values of quanta generation rates q. We note that all of the work underlying the results of Buonanno et al. 17 concerned adults and, for COVID-19, it is not known if appropriate values for the quanta generation rates differ significantly between adults and children. The quanta generation rate might also be expected to vary for a single individual during the course of the infection, but once again, information is limited in the case of SARS-CoV-2 and we take q to be constant in time.Throughout our results, we comment on the changes that would arise if the students within the classroom were (on average) all vocalizing/talking (eg, a noisy classroom), taking again c x \u2248 7 x 10 6 RNA/ ml gives q \u2248 5 quanta/h.

The orange horizontal lines in A and B show the daily averaged CO 2 during the occupied periods (defined for school classrooms as 09:00 and 16:00, see 12 ). The left-hand panes (A and C) show data for a pre/ asymptomatic period in January 2018; the right-hand panes, (B and D), show data for a period in July 2018 January and one in July. The data from January show that, in adherence with the Department for Education 12 guidance for a naturally ventilated classroom, the daily average CO 2 level is kept below around 1500 ppm, and the CO 2 levels only spike above 2000 ppm for very short periods. Moreover, this was the case for all classrooms that we examined throughout almost all the periods we had data (spanning November 2015 to March 2020), and hence enables us to make some comment on whether adherence to the existing guidance might provide adequate airborne infection risk for COVID-19.What is stark fromFigure 1is the decrease in CO 2 levels, both in terms of daily mean and in terms of peak values, in July compared with January. It can be inferred from the gradual drop toward ambient CO 2 levels during January nights that this classroom can be relatively well-sealed when thermal conditions require and there is no need for ventilation. Compare this with July when, presumably, warmer outdoor conditions did not require all openings to be shut at the end of the day and CO 2 levels attain ambient levels for most of the night. Daytime excess CO 2 levels in July typically attain values around half those in January despite occupancy and activity levels which are not expected to vary significantly. This is clear evidence of increased ventilation levels in July in response to warmer weather that are either provided automatically by the ventilation system and/ or by occupant intervention, for example, opening a window. In any event, the change in risk is significant with the likelihood of airborne infection of COVID-19 being more than twice as high in January compared with July. As expected, in both cases the risk increases only during occupied hours producing a \"staircase\" of increase likelihood over the pre/ asymptomatic period. Accounting for an accuracy of \u00b150 ppm in the CO 2 measurements leads to an uncertainty of \u00b10.0012 in the predicted likelihood of infection after 5 working days shown in",

These are detailed inTable 2 andwere chosen because they allowed a direct comparison of similar spaces within the same school for the months under study. What is apparent from the figure is that, as one would expect, the number of airborne secondary infections in winter (January) greatly exceed those of summer (July). For the classrooms shown the average S I in January is 0.63, falling to 0.30 in the July of that year; this is assuming a quanta generation rate of q = 1 quanta/h and we return to a discussion of these values in section 4.3. The change in risk between January and July is not easily classified; many of the relatively risky classrooms in January remain so in July (eg, Re-2, Y1-1, Y1-2, Y1-3, Y3-1, and Y3-2), and some of the relatively low-risk classrooms in January remain so in July (eg, Y2-1, Y2-2, Y3-3, and Y5-1), but others change from being relatively risky to relatively low risk (Y4-1, Y5-2, and Y6-3) or from being relatively low risk to being relatively risky (Y3-3). Interestingly, we found no obvious correlation between these differences and the location of the classroom in the school, for example, whether located on the ground or first floor, or the proximity of one classroom to another.What is also noticeable is the relatively small variation in S I within any given class within the same month. We choose to quantify this by the coefficient of variation (calculated as the ratio of the unbiased estimate of the standard deviation relative to theF I G U R E 2 Variation in average number of secondary infections (S I ) between classrooms of a primary school for the most and least risky months (January and July, respectively) in the school year 2017-2018 (A) ( B) mean) which are, on average, 8% in January 2018 and 14% in July 2018 for the classrooms shown (see the gray bars in",

As can be seen, at the start of each academic year (September) the risk of airborne infection rises as the UK enters winter weather, with the risk peaking in January and February, after which the risk gradually subsides as more temperate spring and summer weather is approached. Taking a value for the quanta generation rate of q = 1 quanta/h 17 yields the values for the absolute airborne number of secondary infections shown inFigure 3A.These lie reassuringly below unity (with a mean of S I = 0.41) and may be representative for the airborne spread of COVID-19 in relatively quiet classrooms. However, classrooms in which children are expected to be more vocal or active (corresponding to q = 5 quanta/h) then one could expect the airborne S I to increase by a factor of approximately five; that is, S I \u2248 2.0. There is uncertainty as to appropriate values for the quanta generation rate for COVID-19, with current evidence suggesting that a relatively low number of high spreading events make an unusually important contribution to the disease spread.18 Consequently, these absolute risk results should be treated with caution.Before examining the seasonal variation of the relative risk, it is worth considering the variations in risk within each month. The average coefficient of variation of S I in all 45 classrooms within each single month is approximately 40%. This is approximately twice as large as the coefficient of variation for S I within each single month from a single school with 17 classrooms suggesting that, in addition to the variations intra school (see section 4.2), significant variations also exist between the different schools. We note also that all the schools had broadly similar ventilation strategies (ie, hybrid ventilation systems) and demonstrated adherence to existing ventilation guidance. Should schools with very different ventilation provision be included then one might expect wider variations: mechanically ventilated school classrooms are set more demanding ventilation provision within the guidance, while schools with uncontrolled ventilation are likely to vary more widely due to the greater influence of occupants interventions.The relative number of airborne secondary infections is presented inFigure 3B, in which the data fromFigure 3Aare shown normalized by the risk in summer (here taken to be July). As the academic year begins, we see that average S I in classrooms might be expected to be about 30%-40% above the levels that would be seen in summer. Broadly speaking, levels then steadily increase toward the Christmas holidays and in January and February, average S I peak at 80%-90% above July levels. Levels remain high in March and then fall sharply back toward summer levels. This seasonal pattern in S I is consistent with intermediate ventilation provision in autumn and spring weather, highest ventilation in summer, and minimum ventilation in winter to avoid heat loss.",

Purely based on changes in environmental conditions, the expected levels of secondary infections in winter (eg January and February) are nearly double those in summer (eg July). We suggest that, while our results for schools with relatively recently installed ventilation provision indicate airborne infection risk for COVID-19 may be low, ventilation provision for wintertime should be assessed or reviewed. It is important tonote that the analysis in this paper is based on historical CO 2 data measured before significant restrictions were introduced in the UK to control COVID-19 transmission. The study therefore models the likely risk under normal operating conditions for the monitored schools. The UK Department for Education has issued guidance to schools recommending additional ventilation, and hence, it is likely that airborne risks over autumn 2020/winter 2021 may be lower than those predicted here. We have also shown that airborne infection risk can vary widely within a school, even in the case that the same ventilation system is installed by the same contractor. Where these differences might increase airborne infection risk, occupants",
