With observation and quarantine as the prevailing standard of care, this study evaluated the effects of virgin coconut oil (VCO) in the biochemical markers of suspect and probable cases of COVID-19. A 28-day randomized, double-blind, controlled intervention was conducted among 63 adults in two isolation facilities in Santa Rosa City, Laguna, Philippines. The participants were randomly assigned to receive either a standardized meal (control) or a standardized meal mixed with a predefined dosage of VCO. Changes in clinical markers were measured at three time points (day 0, 14, and 28), with daily monitoring of COVID-19 symptoms. Participants in the intervention group showed a significant decline in the C-reactive protein level, with the mean CRP level normalized to \u2264 5 mg/dL on the 14th day of the intervention. As an adjunct therapy, meals mixed with VCO is effective fostering faster recovery from COVID-19.",

Inflammation is normal in response to injury or pathogenic infection. COVID-19 infection can produce an excessive immune reaction in the host, known as a \"cytokine storm\" or an overproduction of immune cells and their activating compounds known as cytokines. This surge of activated immune cells causes lung inflammation and fluid build-up that can lead to respiratory distress. The inflammatory chemicals released during COVID-19 infection leads to hyperinflammation forcing the immune cells to destroy healthy cells. Inflammatory response has been associated with the disease severity in COVID-19 (Pamukcu, 2020) .",

The differences were compared between the two groups unpaired t-test while within groups difference between the periods of measurements were computed. The test of hypotheses used level of significance of 0.05. ANOVA was used to determine significant change between the three periods of measurements both within and between groups. Post hoc analysis was employed using Bonferroni test to determine the significant change in the different clinical biomarkers vs. period of measurements. Descriptive analysis was used to compute the mean and standard error of the anthropometric and biochemical variables. In all analyses, a 2-sided significance level of 5% (p-value < 0.05) was used to determine if the difference between the two treatment groups was statistically significant. The repeated measurements of anthropometric measures and biochemical variables were analysed using one-way repeated measures ANOVA, with Greenhouse-Geisser adjustment to the p-values to account for any violation of the \"sphericity\" assumption. Further, we performed one-factor ANOVA with Bonferroni to determine significant pairwise difference. Pearson's chisquare test was used to determine the difference between the two intervention groups for qualitative variables or categorical variables. In the event of small cell frequencies, Fisher's exact test was utilized. For the qualitative variables, the test of significance will only be exploratory and will not be conclusive. Independent t-test was used to compare the means between VCO and Control groups of anthropometric and biochemical variables. Paired t-test was used to compare two means that are from the same individual or related units. The two means typically represent two different times (e.g., pre-test and post-test with an intervention between the two time points).

            "text": "This study evaluated the effects of VCO given to suspect and probable cases of COVID-19 in isolation facilities. Overall, the VCO group showed more rapid relief from symptoms of COVID-19 and a significant higher reduction in mean CRP levels compared to the Control group after 28 days. These results are consistent with the anti-viral and antiinflammatory properties of VCO metabolites as reported in both in vitro and animal studies, bolstering the therapeutic benefit of supplements such as VCO. The results of this study contrast with the findings of a recently published study which found no benefit with high doses of zinc, ascorbic acid, and a combination of these two supplements against COVID-19 compared with usual care (Thomas, Patel, & Bittel, 2021) . It is noteworthy to mention that the design of the study is different from our present study. First, their study participants were home-based and were monitored via telephone, email, or virtual communication. Second, interventions were not blinded and there was no control group. Results therefore should be interpreted with caution in the context of overall null findings (Michos, & Cainzos-Achirica, 2021) . The earlier improvement of signs and symptoms in the VCO group (day 18) compared with the Control group (day 23) may be attributed to the anti-inflammatory or immunomodulation property of VCO. It has been observed in numerous in-vitro and in-vivo studies that coconut oil has an immune-nutritive agent (Widhiarta, 2016) . It was also inferred that the immunodulatory property of VCO was demonstrated in various in-vitro studies by suppressing inflammatory cytokines, including tumour necrosis factor-\u03b1, interferon\u03b3, interleukin-5, interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 (Varma et al., 2019) . VCO metabolites are known to produce highly ordered membranes, which are thought to disrupt pathogens' cellular function by affecting signal transduction due to blockage of promoters, uncoupling of energy systems, altered respiration state, and altered amino acid uptake. In a comparison among the saturated fatty acids from C10 to C18 against Junin virus (JUNV) infection, C12 showed the strongest effect for altering the cellular distribution of the viral proteins, leading to a blockade in the assembly and/or budding of the viral progeny (Thormar, Isaacs, Brown, Barshatzky, & Pessolano, 1987) . Moreover, VCO has been shown to be a potential alternative to antibiotics as a modulator of the cellular immune system (Widianingrum, Noviandi, & Salasia, 2019). Monolaurin has a broad-spectrum activity as an antibacterial, boosts the immune system, and acts as an anti-viral. Its ability to kill various types of viruses, especially enveloped viruses such as influenza viruses and coronavirus 229E, makes monolaurin potentially able to ward off SARS-CoV-2 which is the cause of the COVID-19 (Subroto, & Indiarto, 2020) .",

In a retrospective cohort analysis of 268 medical records with at least two CRP values within the first seven days, results showed that CRP levels increased in a linear fashion during the first week of hospitalization and peaked on day 5. Compared to patients who died, those who survived had lower peak CRP levels and earlier declines while CRP levels were significantly higher in patients who died (Sharifpour, Rangaraju, Liu, Alabyad, Nahab, Creel-Bulos, & Jabaley, 2020) . The faster normalization of CRP level in the VCO group than in the Control group indicates that VCO is effective in the regulation of inflammatory processes. CRP levels often rises before the manifestation of symptoms such as pain or fever, and eventually drops as the body recovers, making it a useful test for monitoring infections (Sproston and Ashworth, 2018) . VCO has anti-inflammatory property which was shown as effective in inhibiting chronic inflammation (Intahpuak, Khonsung, & Panthong, 2010) . This study showed a declining trend of CRP in the VCO group which might be attributed to the the phytochemicals present in VCO.",

VCO contains high saturated fatty acids which could significantly increase LDL-and HDL-cholesterol (Cox, Sutherland, Mann, De Jong Chisolm & Skeaff, 1998; Mendis, Samarajeewa & Thattil, 2001) . Both the LDL-cholesterol (96.6-120.7 mg/dL) and HDL-cholesterol (42.8-53.8 mg/dL) significantly increased. However, the significant increase in LDL-cholesterol was still within the normal range (49.03-172.59 mg/dL). Also, there was no significant difference in the LDL/HDL ratio between the two groups across time periods. Moreover, the mean triglycerides were within normal range (<149.57 mg/dL) at baseline until the end of intervention. Furthermore, there was a significant increase in the HDL-cholesterol in the VCO group compared with the Control group. This could be attributed to the high proportion of lauric and myristic acid content of VCO (Chinwong, Chinwong, & Mangklabruks, 2017) . Although VCO is high in saturated fat, it is high in MCFA which increases HDL-cholesterol compared to other plant-based oils which have polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fat (Mensink, Zock, Kester & Katan, 2003) . This means that the consumption of VCO did not increase the risk of coronary heart disease.",

This might be because of earlier reports explaining the elevated liver enzymes in patients with COVID-19 both with and without chronic liver diseases are common. Existing data suggests that liver injury may be due to drug hepatotoxicity (Cao, Cai, & Chen, 2020) , immune dysfunction (Ghoda, & Ghoda, 2020) and immune-mediated inflammation (Zhang, Shi, & Wang, 2020) . On the other hand, lymphonemia or immune system overreaction caused by immune dysfunction, accompanied by disease progression, can also independently lead to liver derangement. It has been noted that COVID-19 patients frequently manifest elevated levels of liver enzymes (Quali, Romero-Marrero, & Regueiro, 2020) . The VCO group ingested 34.2-120.48 additional calories from intake of VCO. The increase in weight at endpoint in VCO group may be due to the additional calories and the limited physical activity in the isolation facility. Further, it should be noted that the additional intake of VCO lowered FBG slightly although this was not statistically significant.",
