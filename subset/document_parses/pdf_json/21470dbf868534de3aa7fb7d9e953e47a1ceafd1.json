            "text": "Purpose: In February 2020, Italy became the first European country to face the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak. The concerns of infection, financial worries, loss of freedom, and isolation during the ongoing pandemic can lead to negative psychological effects, including anxiety, depression, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. The main aim of our study was to evaluate the relationship between pandemic-related stress and pregnancyspecific stress and assess their role in the development of psychiatric symptoms. We predicted that pregnancy-specific stress would mediate an association of pandemic-related stress with psychiatric symptoms. Patients and Methods: A total of 258 pregnant women were assessed for general emotional symptoms with the General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7), Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2), and an Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder screening (OCD). The Revised Prenatal Distress Questionnaire (NuPDQ) and the Pandemic-Related Pregnancy Stress Scale (PREPS) were administered as measures of pregnancy-specific stress (PSS and pandemic-related, respectively). Mediation effects by NuPDQ for PREPS stress scales on psychiatric outcomes were calculated, using regression series and correcting for general covariates. Results: Almost a third of the sample reported clinically relevant anxiety levels (32.6%), 11.2% were positive for OCD screening and less than 5% were positive for depression screening. The stress related to feeling unprepared for delivery and postpartum (PREPS-PS) predicted PHQ-2 score, both directly and indirectly via PSS, and it predicted GAD-7 score only indirectly. The stress related to fear of infection (PREPS-PIS) was directly associated to GAD-7 score and -through PSS -to PHQ-2 score and OCD. Conclusion: The pandemic onset contributed to poor mental health, especially anxiety, in a substantial portion of Italian pregnant women. Our results emphasize the importance of strategies to reduce pregnancy-specific stress, as well as to diminish stress due to the pandemic. Identifying risk factors for psychological suffering is important to prevent potential long-term consequences for mothers and their offspring.",

            "text": "Alongside the COVID-19 pandemic, a psychiatric epidemic was reported. The possible repercussion of this unusual situation on mental health was identified as a crucial problem since the pandemic onset; in fact, in March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed recommendations to support psychological well-being during the pandemic. 2 The psychological consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak have become a global challenge, particularly for highly vulnerable individuals. Hence, there is a need to identify these population groups and guarantee them appropriate health-care provision. 3 Pregnant women are considered at high-risk for severe impact of the pandemic because of their increased susceptibility to distress. 4 Knowledge about SARS-COV2 infection and its complications during pregnancy was initially limited and much of it was derived from studies regarding two other coronaviruses, MERS and SARS. There had been no cases of intrauterine maternal-foetal transmission with SARS and MERS, so the likelihood of vertical transmission for SARS-COV2 was considered low. 5 At the time of our study, there was a lack of definitive evidence about whether the SARS-COV2 virus may create life-threatening clinical conditions for pregnant women and increase risk of preterm delivery, other adverse birth outcomes, or neonatal morbidity and mortality. 6, 7 Uncertainty about the potential impacts of the virus and the lack of reliable information are sources of stress that may adversely affect the well-being of mothers and the health and development of their children. 8 Furthermore, pregnant women seem to be more vulnerable to anxiety and depression compared to the general population 9,10 and they are also at risk to develop obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). 11 Indeed, several studies have detected an uptick in levels of anxiety and depression in expectant women during the COVID-19 outbreak; [12] [13] [14] these results are in line with previous studies of mothers-to -be during natural disasters. 15 Also, obsessive-compulsive symptoms, which are more common during pregnancy as oppose to other time periods 11 are likely to be more prevalent during the COVID-19 pandemic because of infection fears and public health measures emphasizing protective behaviours such as handwashing. 16 Stress-related to the pandemic co-occurs with pregnancy-specific stress (PSS), which derives from worries about physical symptoms, bodily changes, and concerns about the baby. 17, 18 It is well known that PSS can negatively affect birth outcome and development of the child and some evidence demonstrating an association of PSS with clinically relevant anxiety and depressive symptoms. 19, 20 Problem Statement",

The participation in the research was proposed directly by the participant's physician. Inclusion criteria were current pregnancy, age over 18 years, and Italian fluency. Two hundred fifty-eight women agreed to participate and completed the study questionnaires. All recruited women were volunteers and received no incentives for their participation. The participants filled out the questionnaire in a paper-and-pencil format at the hospital during routine clinical check-ups. All participants provided informed consent. All procedures performed in this study were in accordance with the ethical standards of the 1964 Helsinki Declaration and its subsequent amendments. Approval was granted by the Medical Ethics Committee of Friuli Venezia Giulia region (CEUR-2018-Sper-027-ASUIUD). Written informed consent was obtained from all participants included in the study.

The internal consistency of PHQ-2 resulted good (\u03b1=0.83), 30 and it resulted to be an efficient screening tool for depression in pregnant women. 31 Lastly, to assess the presence or absence of obsessivecompulsive symptoms, we used the OCD Screening, derived from the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-5, 32 which consists of two questions. The screening assesses the presence of obsessive-compulsive symptoms when women responded \"Yes\" to both of the questions.",

Almost a third of the sample reported anxiety levels compatible with a clinical disorder (32.6% of the sample), and a relevant percentage was positive for screening obsessive-compulsive problems (11.2%). In contrast, less than 5% of the sample had clinically relevant depression scores. The observed frequencies suggest that the sample is mainly characterized by anxiety problems. However, depression and anxiety are typically comorbid during pregnancy, and high anxiety is a risk factor for antenatal depression. 35 Study findings suggest that a global pandemic may create unique circumstances that result in different patterns and prevalence of psychopathology among pregnant women, with particular impact manifested in their anxiety. [36] [37] [38] About half of the participants that were positive for obsessive-compulsive symptoms also indicated anxiety problems. The frequency of high anxiety was also higher than that reported for the Italian general population during the pandemic: Mazza and colleagues found high anxiety levels in 7.2% of their sample, and very high anxiety levels in 11.5%. 39 A recent meta-analysis assessed the psychological impact of COVID 19 pandemic in pregnant women. It included 19 papers from ten different countries and showed an increased prevalence of anxiety and depression among expectant mothers, with an overall reported rate of 42% and 25% respectively. 40 Moreover, a longitudinal evaluation of pregnant women during quarantine showed a more pronounced increase in anxiety, depression and negative affect compared to non-pregnant women, suggesting that being pregnant may be consider a risk factor for psychopathological consequences of the pandemic. 41 Samples recruited in the first and second pandemic onset phases were quite homogeneous. Nevertheless, a few differences emerged between April-May and July-August. For example, we found lower financial status among participants in the second phase. Low socioeconomic status is a well-known risk factor for psychological disorders, in particular, depression. 42, 43 Studies of the SARS outbreak in 2003 44 demonstrated that income loss resulting from quarantines and lockdowns, when people are unable to work, can be a risk factor for poor mental health, 45 especially depressive symptoms. 46 Consistent with these findings, in our sample, current unemployment was related to clinical levels of depression. We also detected increased levels of anxiety in unpartnered women. Living alone is a significant determinant of loneliness, a condition that can increase the risk of mental impairment leading to anxiety, depression, and even suicidal ideation. 47 Higher levels of anxiety and depression were also associated with previous emotional or psychiatric problems. A recent Italian study detected a greater level of COVID-19 concerns and anxiety among expectant mothers with a history of psychiatric disturbances. 48 Similarly, many studies have found that a history of psychiatric illness increases the risk of antenatal onset of depression. 49 Lastly, knowledge about COVID-19 was positively related to a higher level of anxiety and depression, a result in contrast with several studies that associated the absence of information about COVID-19 infection and pregnancy with a greater level of anxiety and distress among childbearing women. 36, 50, 51 Nevertheless, our data need to be understood in the context of the uncertainty and constantly evolving knowledge about the mechanism of transmission of the virus and its potential consequences that were typical during the onset of the pandemic when this study was conducted. 52 Apart from the factors that were associated with poorer mental health, we found that healthy activities seem to have a protective role against anxiety and depression symptoms, also as shown in previous research. 53, 54 In particular, many studies in the general population and in pregnant women report a positive impact of healthy behavior on depressive symptoms, corroborating the beneficial relationship between healthy lifestyles and lower levels of depression that we found. 53, 55, 56 As we predicted, stress related to the pandemic cooccurred with stress that is unrelated to the pandemic but focused on pregnancy itself. Both types of stress were potent predictors of poorer mental health, with distinct ",

For example, women experiencing greater stress involving fears about perinatal COVID-19 infection had higher anxiety, and this association occurred in part because these women also experienced greater distress unassociated with the pandemic, specific to being pregnant. Previous studies concerning the SARS outbreak in 2003 57,58 similarly showed that fear of becoming infected was related to greater anxiety in pregnant women. Additionally, in the present study, women who reported higher pandemicrelated stress involving concerns that they would be unprepared for childbirth or the postpartum also experienced greater anxiety; this association was entirely explained by the association of this type of pandemic-related stress with pandemic unrelated, pregnancy-specific stress (PSS). Similarly, PSS entirely explained the association of perinatal infection stress with depressive symptoms and partially explained the association of preparedness stress with this mental health outcome. Feeling unprepared for birth or postpartum due to the pandemic can lead to demoralization and hopelessness and hence to depressive symptoms. 59 Lastly, obsessive-compulsive symptoms were also predicted by higher stress involving fears of perinatal infection, and this association was explained by higher PSS among women who reported this type of pandemicrelated stress. This result parallels a previous study 16 that found in a sample of university students that the fear of COVID-19 infection was strongly correlated with scores on a measure of OCD, suggesting that such fear, together with anxiety and pandemic-induced quarantine, is a risk factor for obsessive-compulsive symptoms.",

In our analysis, pandemic-related stress predicts the development of anxiety, depressive, and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. These associations are partially mediated by experiencing more of the type of stress that pregnant women commonly experience, which includes stress related to their concerns about their health and changes to their body, about impending delivery, and about the challenges they are about to face as the parent of a new-born. Hence, our results emphasize the importance of strategies to reduce such pregnancy-specific stress, as well as to diminish the stress that has arisen for pregnant women due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, and OCD symptoms in pregnant women have been shown to elevate risk for a variety of adverse maternal, foetal, and infant outcomes. [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] Identifying risk factors for poor mental health and promptly intervening is fundamental to stem detrimental consequences in the short term, as well as to prevent their longer term harms to women and children.",
