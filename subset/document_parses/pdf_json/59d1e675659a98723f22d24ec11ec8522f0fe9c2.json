Automatic lung infection segmentation from computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the quantitative analysis of COVID-19. However, the major challenge lies in the inadequacy of annotated COVID-19 datasets. Currently, there are several public non-COVID lung lesion segmentation datasets, providing the potential for generalizing useful information to the related COVID-19 segmentation task. In this paper, we propose a novel relation-driven collaborative learning model to exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions for annotation-efficient COVID-19 CT lung infection segmentation. The model consists of a general encoder to capture general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, and a target encoder to focus on task-specific features based on COVID-19 infections. We develop a collaborative learning scheme to regularize feature-level relation consistency of given input and encourage the model to learn more general and discriminative representation of COVID-19 infections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that trained with limited COVID-19 data, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions can further improve state-of-the-art performance with up to 3.0% in dice similarity coefficient and 4.2% in normalized surface dice. In addition, experimental results on large scale 2D dataset with CT slices show that Manuscript our method significantly outperforms cutting-edge segmentation methods metrics. Our method promotes new insights into annotation-efficient deep learning and illustrates strong potential for real-world applications in the global fight against COVID-19 in the absence of sufficient high-quality annotations.",

This severe disease has been declared as a public health emergency of international concern by the World Health Organization (WHO), which has caused more than 2,600,000 deaths until the date of 9th March 2021, according to the statistics of Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center. 1 As one of the most commonly used imaging methods, computed tomography (CT) plays an important role in the fight against COVID-19 [1]- [3] . Researchers have proved that CT images have strong ability to capture typical features like ground glass and bilateral patchy shadows of affected patients [4] and are shown to be more sensitive compared with standard viral nucleic acid detection using real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the early diagnosis of COIVD-19 infection [5] . Besides, CT images can provide visual evaluation of the extent of lung abnormalities and assist the process of prognostic [6] .",

Since manual contour delineation is time-consuming and laborious, and suffers from inter and intra-observer variabilities [8] , it is of great significance to develop artificial intelligence-based approaches to assist in the automatic segmentation of COVID-19 infections. Recently, the unprecedented development in deep learning has showed significant improvements and achieved state-of-the-art performances in many medical image segmentation tasks [9] - [12] , and deep neural networks have been widely applied in the global fight against COVID-19 [13] - [16] . However, the success of deep learning methods mainly requires large amount of high-quality annotated datasets, while it is impractical to collect large amount of well annotated data in real clinical approach, especially when radiologists are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Additionally, as shown in Fig. 1 , the large variations in shape, size and position of lung infections and large inter-case variations pose great challenges for the segmentation tasks [17] . Therefore, exploring annotation-efficient COVID-19 lung infection segmentation methods with limited labeled data has become an urgent need especially in the current situation.",

To alleviate annotation scarcity, annotation-efficient methods have received great attention in medical image analysis community [19] , [20] . For example, semi-supervised learning aims at learning from a limited amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data, which is an effective way to explore knowledge from the unlabeled data [21] . Weakly supervised learning explores the use of weak annotations like noisy annotations and sparse annotations [22] .

[35] adopt transfer learning procedure and propose a simple CNN architecture with a small number of parameters to distinguish COVID-19 from normal X-rays. Misra et al. [36] propose a multi-channel pre-trained ResNet architecture to facilitate the diagnosis of COVID-19. For segmentation of COVID-19 infections, Wang et al. [18] evaluate different transfer learning methods and revealed the benefits of transferring knowledge from non-COVID lung lesions. However, transfer learning only takes the advantage of existing models, and non-COVID cases are not utilized in the training procedure of downstream COVID-19 segmentation tasks. Different from these existing methods, our method aims at learning from COVID-19 and non-COVID lung lesions collaboratively to exploit shared semantic information.",

Following the design of standard U-Net [37] , [38] , our network consists of two encoders with the same architecture and a shared decoder. Since the encoder serves as a contraction to extract image contextual features, the upper one named general encoder (G) is adopted to capture general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions, and the lower one named target encoder (T) is adopted to focus on task-specific features of the target COVID-19 infection segmentation task. After that, extracted features from these two parallel encoders are concatenated together for the input of the decoder. The shared decoder (D) serves as a symmetric expanding path to recover the spatial information of the extracted features. Since our motivation is to use non-COVID lesions to assist in the segmentation of COVID-19 infections, the general encoder can be seemed as an auxiliary branch to extract shared knowledge. Therefore, we only employ the skip connections between the target encoder and shared decoder for the fusion of multi-scale features as shown in the top right corner of Fig. 2 .",

As shown in Table III , it is observed that all our methods can achieve better performance on all metrics compared with fully supervised methods, showing the effectiveness of our method. Besides, the usage of L G rc and L T rc can both further improve the segmentation performance compared with baseline. When removing the target relation consistency, the average segmentation performance of five folds is degraded by 0.4% and 0.2% on DSC and NSD, respectively. The result proves that the usage of target relation consistency loss L T rc can enforce the target encoder to be more discriminative, so as to improve the segmentation performance. However, the improvement is susceptible to the domain difference. Besides, we also conduct experiments of our backbone by removing the general relation consistency loss L G rc . In this way, the general encoder is frozen and are not updated during the training procedure, which means that the knowledge transfer is not available. The experimental results demonstrate that the average segmentation performance is degraded by 0.6% and 0.3% on DSC and NSD, showing the importance of knowledge transfer in our collaborative learning scheme. Some segmentation results of our method and 3D nnUNet are illustrated in Fig. 3 for visual comparison. As shown in the figure, our method can generate segmentation results with more accurate boundaries in Fig. 3(a)(b) , and less segmentation mistakes in small infection areas in Fig. 3(c)(d)(e) .",

However, these transfer learning methods show instability under different data distribution in five-fold cross validation experiments.

However, their workflow is still based on transfer learning, that training a network first on non-COVID cases and then on COVID-19 cases with foregoing pre-trained parameters. The main limitation is that the learning procedures of two tasks are separate. Therefore, the shared knowledge of non-COVID and COVID-19 cases cannot be fully exploited. It is observed that our method takes advantage of collaborative learning between two encoders and interactively improves the overall learning procedure. As a consequence, our method achieves higher segmentation performance with an averaged DSC of 70.3% and averaged NSD of 74.2%. Comparing with training from scratch, exploiting shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions can achieve further improvements with up to 3.0% in DSC and 4.2% in NSD.

In addition to the lung tumor and pleural effusion datasets introduced before, we use LiTS dataset [9] with liver tumor annotations in abdominal CT volumes as non-COVID lesions in our method for comparison. Besides, to make comparison between intra-disease and interdisease relations, we use another multi-national CT dataset with labeled ground glass opacities [51] as an out-of-domain dataset for the learning of general branch, which is more relevant with similar appearance to the target dataset in our framework. In our experiments, we follow the settings of our 2D experiments with the same network backbone and implementation details. To make quantitative comparisons, we select out the same amount of 60 cases from these different datasets for the general branch, and 10 cases from the COVID-19 segmentation dataset for target branch. The experimental results are shown in Table VI . It can be observed from the table that using intradisease dataset that are more related to the target dataset can achieve better performance compared with other datasets under the same condition, which proves that more similar appearance can lead to more significant improvement by exploiting shared knowledge. Specifically, we observe that using non-lung lesions can also obtain comparable results compared with experiments using non-COVID lung lesions like lung tumor and pleural effusion.",

However, accurate segmentation of COVID-19 lung infections is a challenging task due to the large appearance variance of COVID-19 lesions of patients in different severity level, and existing data-driven segmentation methods mainly rely on large amount of well annotated data. In order to mitigate the insufficiency of labeled COVID-19 CT scans, it is essential and meaningful to develop annotation-efficient segmentation methods for the COVID-19 lung infection segmentation task.",

Some previous studies also highlight the usage of non-COVID lung lesions [18] , [42] . However, these existing approaches merely focus on investigating the transferability in COVID-19 infection segmentation. Although their results reveal benefits of pre-training on non-COVID datasets, the improvement is limited when shared knowledge between COVID-19 and non-COVID lung lesions cannot be fully utilized. Our experiment reveal that the proposed collaborative learning scheme can effectively exploit shared semantic information by regularizing the consistency between extracted features and promote the training procedure in the absence of sufficient high-quality COVID-19 data. In addition, our scheme can be extended to utilize unlabeled COVID-19 data for feature relation regularization. Experimental results show that even without annotations, our method can use unlabeled scans to explore feature relation and achieve more consistent and robust learning. Fig. 7 presents an example of challenging cases for COVID-19 lung infection segmentation. Although our method can achieve significant improvement by exploiting knowledge from non-COVID lesions, the limitation still exists. We observe that comparing with ground truth, there are still some mis-segmented areas when encountering challenging cases with multiple irregular infections. As a near future work, we intend to explore how to achieve more robust and reliable knowledge transfer. In addition, we also plan to extend our method to other medical image segmentation tasks to explore the usage of out-of-domain datasets for annotationefficient deep learning, thus enhancing the applicability of these methods in real-world applications.",

Specifically, the model consists of two encoders with the same architecture and a shared decoder. The general encoder is adopted to capture general lung lesion features based on multiple non-COVID lesions and the target encoder is adopted to focus on task-specific feature of COVID-19 infection. To exploit shared knowledge from non-COVID lesions, we develop a collaborative learning scheme to regularize the relation between extracted features of given input for the training. We present a set of experiments on 2D slices and 3D volumes based on three COVID-19 datasets and two non-COVID datasets. Experimental results reveal clear benefits of utilizing non-COVID lesions in the absence of sufficient COVID-19 annotations to train a robust segmentation model. Moreover, we provide a semi-supervised learning solution to utilize the unlabeled COVID-19 cases for feature relation regularization and achieved performance improvements. Among all comparison experiments, our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods and illustrates strong potential for real-world applications in the global fight against COVID-19.",
