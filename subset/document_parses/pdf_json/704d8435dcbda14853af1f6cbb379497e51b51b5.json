In this block, we have grouped research studies that focus on health indoors, in buildings and homes, responding to the needs of people in controlled environments [102, 104] . Himeur [92] reviews energy efficiency systems based on data fusion from the consumer's perspective as a cost-effective strategy for energy reduction in buildings. In terms of health, the main issue at hand, it is concluded that energy efficiency indirectly leads to improvements in terms of the environment and pollution, a benefit to public health. Jia [100] investigates cutting-edge projects and IoT adoptions for the development of smart buildings, both in academic and industrial contexts.

The impact of smart systems on public health is clear, but it is also important to analyze the impact of the SDGs. Therefore, in Table 5 , we provide an overview of the relationship between SDGs and their impact on people's health, taking into account that we are going to study IoT systems and sensor applications in health and healthcare. A high quality healthcare system must take into account the population and their needs, health sector governance, health delivery partnerships, human resources, pharmaceutical laboratories, along with data, IoT, sensor systems, AI, engineering systems, energy efficiency, and advanced technology. Healthcare systems must develop the ability to measure and use data to learn and must be based on four values: they must be for people and they must be equitable, resilient, and efficient [127] . Well-directed political institutions expanding essential public services such as healthcare, education, energy, water, and sanitation are effective in promoting the SDGs [128] .",

Healthcare systems must develop the ability to measure and use data to learn and must be based on four values: they must be for people and they must be equitable, resilient, and efficient [127] .

A high quality healthcare system must take into account the population and their needs, health sector governance, health delivery partnerships, human resources, pharmaceutical laboratories, along with data, IoT, sensor systems, AI, engineering systems, energy efficiency, and advanced technology. Healthcare systems must develop the ability to measure and use data to learn and must be based on four values: they must be for people and they must be equitable, resilient, and efficient [127] .

A high quality healthcare system must take into account the population and their needs, health sector governance, health delivery partnerships, human resources, pharmaceutical laboratories, along with data, IoT, sensor systems, AI, engineering systems, energy efficiency, and advanced technology. Healthcare systems must develop the ability to measure and use data to learn and must be based on four values: they must be for people and they must be equitable, resilient, and efficient [127] .

A high quality healthcare system must take into account the population and their needs, health sector governance, health delivery partnerships, human resources, pharmaceutical laboratories, along with data, IoT, sensor systems, AI, engineering systems, energy efficiency, and advanced technology. Healthcare systems must develop the ability to measure and use data to learn and must be based on four values: they must be for people and they must be equitable, resilient, and efficient [127] . Well-directed political institutions expanding essential public services such as healthcare, education, energy, water, and sanitation are effective in promoting the SDGs [128] .",
