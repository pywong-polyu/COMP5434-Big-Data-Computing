New York City administration enacted a strict isolation decision at the end of March 2020 to tackle the COVID-19, creating a unique opportunity to assess air quality. Therefore, we investigated the impact of the lockdown on air quality in New York City. We evaluated the air pollutants concentration, i.e., PM 2.5 , CO, NO 2 , SO 2 , and O 3, during the lockdown and compared them with pre-COVID-19. We explored the first phase of lockdown through a spatial approach, then formulated the air quality index (AQI) of each pollutant before and during the lockdown. Our findings revealed that (1) there was a significant decline in the concentration level of PM 2.5 from 10.3 to 4.0 \u03bcg/m 3 during phase one of lockdown. (2) NO 2 concentrations have been decreased by up to 52% in 1st phase of lockdown. (3) O 3 concentration has been increased by 44.4%. (4) Brooklyn, Manhattan, Queens, and Staten Island County encountered 18.75%, 55.62%, 47.14%, and 47% diminution in AQI due to lockdown as compared to 2018, respectively. Our key findings can provide critical environmental implications for policymakers, researchers, academics, and the US government.",

As per the World Health Organization (WHO) estimation, seven million people die each year due to poor air quality (WHO 2014) . It is primarily as a result of the concentration of pollutants such as NO 2 , NH 3 , PM 2.5 , and SO 2 CO. from different human actions such as mining activities, the process of manufacturing, transportation, residential cooking, biomass, and waste burnings (Kinnon et al. 2019; Li et al. 2019; Blondet et al. 2019; Ko\u00e7ak and K\u0131z\u0131lkaya 2020; Dedeo\u011flu et al. 2021) . During the past two decades, numerous studies highlighted that polluted air incites short-term and long-term health issues such as asthma, cancer, premature deaths, and cardiovascular mortality, among humans (Bowatte et al. 2017; Deng et al. 2017; Zhang et al. 2017; Gilderbloom et al. 2020; Karuppasamy et al. 2020) .

However, after the restricted human activates amidst COVID-19 lockdown, globally, a significant improvement has been observed in air quality, such as the USA (Pata 2020) , India , Iran (Broomandi et al. 2020) , China (Bao and Zhang 2020; Balsalobre-Lorente et al. 2020) , Malaysia (Suhaimi et al. 2020) , Spain (Baldasano 2020) , Brazil (Dantas et al. 2020) , and Japan (Ma and Kang 2020) . The decline in air pollution is plausible due to the restrictions on human activities (He et al. 2020) . Recently, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) observed a 30% decline in the concentrations of atmospheric NO 2 in the urban Northeast of the USA during March 2020 compared to the mean value of March 2015-2019 (see Fig. 2 ). Hence, the lockdown presents short-term benefits to the environment and air quality and poses a dual-edge threat in the long-term perspective. Firstly, while recession or economic slowdown will adversely affect countries' ongoing efforts towards climate mitigations; additionally, financial fear and rising health issues could overshadow the problem of climate change. Secondly, the sudden resumption of economic activities after the lockdown creates enormous pressure on the environment (Chakraborty and Maity 2020) .",

The business restrictions in New York have created a unique opportunity to assess the effect of lockdown on environmental pollution. The City of New York is also known as the hub of the entire world's financial, cultural, and media capital. Due to the contagion of COVID-19, a complete lockdown is imposed in New York from March 22 up to March 31 and later extended up to May 15, 2020 (for more details, see https://www.governor. ny.gov/). By this lockdown, almost all mass transportation and industrial activities have been prohibited.

Overall, the impact and significance of lockdown are still not well understood and likely to have a significant role in the restoration of air quality (Balsalobre-Lorente et al. 2020) . The extent of literature on the impact of COVID-19 pandemic lockdown on air pollutants is available; however, it is limited and covers only a few specific scenarios (Pata 2020; Suhaimi et al. 2020; . Previous studies have used one or a few pollutants to assess air quality during the lockdown.

            "text": "Similarly, Perera et al. (2021) focused on the single particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) during the COVID-19 shutdown. Likewise, Fu et al. (2020) analyze the effect of lockdown on air quality in 20 major cities, including New York City. Based on the argument mentioned above, we can argue that using a single or few pollutants may not present a holistic view of air quality changes during the lockdown. There is a wide variety of air pollutants. These pollutants, which have adverse effects on human health and the ecosystem, can be solid particles, liquid droplets, or gases. Pollutants can be of natural or human origin. However, pollutants are divided into two as primary and secondary pollutants. Primary pollutants are produced mainly by a process similar to a volcanic eruption, carbon monoxide released from motor vehicle exhaust, or sulfur dioxide released from industrial enterprises. Major primary pollutants are hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), SO 2 , CO, NO x , O 3 , hydrocarbons, CO 2 , CH 4 , lead (Pb), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Secondary pollutants are not released directly; instead, they are formed by the reaction or interaction of primary pollutants in the air. Ground-level ozone is an important example of secondary pollutants. Ground-level ozone has recently been one of the important parameters followed in terms of urban air pollution, especially in developed countries. In addition, PAN (peroxyacetyl nitrate), chlorofluorocarbons (CFC), formaldehyde, ammonium sulfate, and nitric acid (HNO 3 ) are other important secondary pollutants (Nazaroff and Weschler 2004; Sitaras and Siskos 2008; Masiol et al. 2017 ). This study is different from the earlier studies on the ground that we analyze the impact of lockdown in New York City on air quality using five air pollutants, i.e., CO, NO 2 , ozone, PM 2.5 , and SO 2, from March 23, 2020, to May 30, 2020. Unlike the previous studies, this study also examines the county-wise variations in the air quality of New York. In doing so, this study seeks to answer the following questions. Does the concentration of air pollutants decrease during the lockdown? Does the air quality index improve during the lockdown?",

Geographically, the city of New York can be divided into five boroughs, viz., Bronx, State Island, Queens, Brooklyn, and Manhattan. The climate of New York can be categorized into four distinct seasons, spring (Mar-May), summer (Jun-Aug), autumn (Sept-Nov), and winter (Dec-Feb). The average temperature varies between 34\u00b0F to 53\u00b0F in spring, 63\u00b0F to 67\u00b0F in summer, 41\u00b0F to 60\u00b0F in autumn, and 26\u00b0F to 30\u00b0F in winter. New York City has a subtropical oceanic kind of weather. Despite the coastline area, temperature varies significantly between the summer and winter due to prevailing inland masses. Another critical factor is the dense urban population, which stimulates the average temperature (Depietri and McPhearson 2018; Johnson et al. 2020) . The city has 10,194 per square kilometer of population density, and Manhattan has a population density of 25,846 per square kilometer that makes it the densest of the county in the United States (Plane and Mu 2020) . Air pollution problems caused by motor vehicles, industries, and other fuel-burning sources are mainly responsible for critical health hazards in New York City. The American Lung Association ranked 16th New York City metropolitan area for ozone pollution when compared to 25 other American cities (Miranda et al. 2011) .",

Moreover, this investigation compared the fallouts of these concentrations for both before the lockdown and during the lockdown period. The EPA has established the air quality index (AQI), which is utilized to describe the excellence of air. The AQI is generally established through the pollutant standards, where the impact of a specific pollutant is captured in a single index by utilizing the correct accretion method (Ott 1978) . This index contains the six categories that define health standards. Table 1 exhibited that an AQI holding the value of more than 300 signifies the hazardous quality of air, while the value of AQI less than 50 defines good quality of the air in the USA. According to Clean Air Act 1990, the AQI is comprised of five pollutants, i.e., carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM), 1 nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), and ground-level ozone (O 3 ). First, this investigation analyzed the variations in each pollutant before and during the lockdown period. Second, this study converted each pollutant into AQI to measure the health impact of each pollutant. Finally, the study combined all these air quality indices to reckon the environmental quality of New York called NYAQI. The investigators also compared the fallouts of these indices before and during the lockdown period so that effective policies can be established.

Besides, the level of AQI PM 2.5 showed a significant decline in its value during the lockdown period. The study noted an average reduction of 47.72% in the air quality index of PM 2.5 , inferring that COVID-19 has imperatively upsurged air quality in New York. Also, the inspection publicized that lockdown has evocatively intensified the level of ozone (O 3 ) in New York City. The study exposed that there was a 44.4% increase in groundlevel ozone. This proliferation in ozone concentration results from deterioration in the level of nitrogen oxide (NO), which leads to diminishing the consumption of ozone (NO + O 3 = NO 2 + O 2 ) and results in an upsurge in the level of groundlevel ozone concentration.",

The exposure and impact assessment of lockdown is performed on New York City's air quality, one of the most populated cities in the USA, with an estimated 2019 population of 8,336,817, distributed over 302.6 mi 2 . Due to the contagion of COVID-19, a complete lockdown is imposed in New York from March 22 up to March 31 and later extended to May 15, which has encouraged the author to evaluate the impact of lockdown on the air quality of New York City. This investigation utilized the daily average data of CO (8 h), NO 2 (1 h), PM 2.5 (24 h), O 3 (8 h), and SO 2 (1 h) to determine the air quality before and during the COVID-19 period. The study utilized the data from January 01, 2020, to May 31, 2020. The investigation revealed that the concentration level of CO had been decreased from 0.7 to 0.22 ppm during the lockdown period. NO 2 concentration faced a decline in its value from 25 to 12 ppb due to the lockdown that happened due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the level of O 3 has been augmented during the COVID-19 period from the concentration level of 0.02 ppb to 0.03. The examination discovered that a decrease in NO 2 concentration has imperatively upsurge the ground-level ozone.",

On the other hand, the investigation converted each pollutant into an air quality index to ascertain the impact of lockdown on air pollution in New York. The study found that the mean value of AQI CO dwindled from 5.04 to 2.53, while the mean value of AQI NO 2 shrunk from 30.45 to 20.20. Nonetheless, the average air quality index of O 3 has been concentrated from 25.07 to 36.20 during the lockdown period in New York. Furthermore, the mean value of AQI SO 2 and AQI PM 2.5 lessened from 1.29 to 0.52 and 31.85 to 16.65, respectively. The on hand investigation assessed the overall environmental quality in New York and found that the mean value of the New York air quality index (NYAQI) has been contracted from 18.65 to 14.97 during the lockdown period. The study evaluated the year-wise air quality in New York and discovered that AQI had been Based on the results, this study recommends that the New York City government should design a regional joint-emission control plan rather than sporadic and abrupt interventions to improve the environmental quality. The government should create awareness about a clean e nv i r o nm en t a m on g t he i r c i t i z e ns a n d i n cl ud e environmental-related coursework in primary education in general; it will be the preferred option to reduce air pollution.
