Governments can contain the disease and thereby mitigate the detrimental public health impact; allow the virus to spread to reach herd immunity; test, track, isolate, and treat; and suppress the disease regionally. An observation of Sweden and Finland showed a difference in feasible ways to communicate the chosen policy to the citizenry. Sweden assumed the herd immunity strategy and backed it up with health utilitarian arguments. This was easy to communicate to the Swedish people, who appreciated the voluntary restrictions approach and trusted their decision makers. Finland chose the contain and mitigate strategy and was towards the end of the observation period apparently hesitating between suppression and the test, track, isolate, and treat approach. Both are difficult to communicate to the general public accurately, truthfully, and acceptably. Apart from health utilitarian argumentation, something like the republican political philosophy or selective truth telling are needed. The application of republicanism to the issue, however, is problematic, and hiding the truth seems to go against the basic tenets of liberal democracy.",

What kind of a political system do we want to endorse? What can governments do to secure us what we want in times of crisis? As I have observed, in the commercial and social media, people's reactions to the pandemic and governmental attempts to control it, 1 the societal values that keep cropping up are openness, equality, autonomy, and solidarity. People in liberal democracies believe that these values are best fostered by their own system and its main elements: rule of law, respect for basic rights, transparent political decision making, and participatory governance. Social democracies abide by the same rules but put more emphasis on the common good and may assume a more lenient stand on restrictions of individual freedom.",

And they are responsible for treating all people equally, yet some instruments of pandemic control hit already vulnerable groups harder than the rest of the population. The elderly may be isolated in their own homes or care homes, ostensibly for their own good, but with potentially harmful consequences.

We do not know if or when we can expect these to be achieved. 2 In the meantime, four main approaches to dealing with the pandemic have offered themselves: (1) Containing and mitigating the disease, (2) Letting the disease spread until herd immunity is reached, (3) Testing, tracking, isolating, and treating, and (4) Suppressing the disease. Methods (1), (3), and (4) are closely related and can be used consecutively or in combination.

The methods include restricting movement between regions; closing down national borders; setting curfews; implementing lockdown, isolation, and quarantine rules; moving to distant working; closing daycare centers, schools, and universities; cancelling mass events; and shutting down bars, restaurants, and nonessential services. In most countries that reacted to the pandemic in an orderly fashion, one combination or another of these was initially endorsed. The primary aim of containment is to mitigate the effect of the pandemic by \"flattening the curve,\" that is, by not letting too many people have the disease at the same time. This gives healthcare systems time to prepare and a better chance to provide effective care.",

Standard liberal views at least have shunned them, although they, too, can have their justifications. 5 In between, citizens have in some cases interpreted public instructions as legal orders. After a few weeks into the containment stage, many people over 70 in Finland began to ask, \"When are we allowed to see our grandchildren again?\" The moral coercion of the public opinion had, apparently, worked, as the Matti H\u00e4yry 2 home isolation of the elderly had never been more than a governmental recommendation. 6 ",

When a sufficient percentage (a vast majority) of the population has been infected, the virus cannot find new hosts, and it will peter out, at least until a new mutation starts to circulate. The leaders of the United Kingdom and the United States have flirted with this idea, but their overall strategies have remained unclear. Sweden, however, seems to have embraced the approach, with considerably fewer restrictions and controls than its neighboring countries. This response may have been partly dictated by a late awakening to the situation, but the government and other public officials have stood by it since. 7 Sweden's state epidemiologist Anders Tegnell has argued that the death rate, appalling in Sweden during the first few months, 8 will be matched by other countries later, when the second wave of the pandemic hits the populations that are first protected and then gradually left unprotected again. 9 The herd immunity approach raises both scientific and moral questions. 10 Since SARS-CoV-2 is a new virus, we cannot be sure that those infected develop a proper and lasting immunity, especially if the virus begins to mutate significantly. Since tests have been unreliable, we cannot know for certain that our figures are correct and that herd immunity can be reached within a few months, as the Swedish state epidemiologist believes. Also, as the number of COVID-19 deaths in Sweden is really remarkably high, effective vaccinations and better treatments may yet save countries that have chosen containment from such figures. An additional moral concern is solidarity, which seems to have taken a blow with the disproportionate number of deaths among the elderly.",

When the basic reproduction number R 0 has been forced down to less than 1 by handwashing, facemasks, physical distancing, and restrictions, one infected person infects less than one other, and the pandemic begins to fade. If all precautions and restrictions are abandoned at once, however, R 0 again rises above one, and the pandemic starts to respread. One strategy in the face of this, adopted by Germany and Finland among others, is to test, track, isolate, and treat. The number of tests is increased considerably, and governments and technology companies are developing smart phone applications that make it possible to follow infection routes, identify people who have been in contact with carriers, test them, and, depending on the test result, isolate or treat them. The spread of the pandemic is allowed in this model for public health or other reasons, but under strict scrutiny.",

If the R 0 number is kept close to 1, which would be safer than letting it rocket, it could take years before the pandemic is over. A safe and effective vaccine could provide the solution, but we do not know if or when to expect its completion. Meanwhile, economies can suffer a great deal.

A couple of days later, the Finnish Ministry of Social Affairs and Health publicized an announcement, listed government's decisions, and described the new approach as a test, track, isolate, and treat model to manage and control the pandemic. Prime Minister Sanna Marin was not satisfied by the wording and corrected that the government still aims to suppress the pandemic. The Prime Minister's correction was supported by the law, as it is the government's legal duty to suppress pandemics, not to manage or control them. 17 We do not know, however, what exactly motivated her proclamation. The Ministry bowed to the edict and revised their wording. 18 The fact remains that the Ministry's original formulation was probably closer to the truth. The government may want to talk about suppression for rhetoric reasons, but since this is only \"suppression\" in the Imperial College sense, the actual strategy seems to be confinement to mitigate damage to public health and possibly to national economy.

People would then argue that the sacrifice is immoral and point out that the lives lost would be in vulnerable groups. If the Healthcare Crisis Leadership as Ethics Communication government goes, instead, for genuine suppression, telling the truth would require them to estimate the remaining time for the restrictions, their effects on the economy, and their impact on people's wellbeing. Businesspeople would object, others would complain about lost livelihoods, and the rest would begin to protest against the curtailment of their liberty.",

Even amidst a pandemic, authorities should be constantly reviewing the situation and removing bans and restrictions where they are no longer absolutely needed. Most governments, democratic and authoritarian alike, at least give the impression of doing this with their actions during the COVID-19 crisis. The transparency of the information conveyed to the media and the general public is an issue in which a dividing line may exist. China and Russia, not to mention North Korea, can be trusted to give out scant information in a way that does not embarrass their leaders. At the other end of the continuum, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Iceland, Italy, Germany, Norway, and Sweden have communicated in a more transparent manner, although the clarity of the message is not always certain. The unclarity is mostly due to inadequacies in the information that the authorities have.

Some countries and regions have also assumed the strategy of mitigating the problem, stating confidently that COVID-19 is just another flu, and noting that people die every year of influenza without the lockdown of societies.

As an old no-nonsense eugenic social democracy, 27 it can assume a health utilitarian line; and as a consensus-decision-making society, it appreciates that the authorities have not curtailed civil liberties without asking the people. Opposition exists, but the government and the epidemiologists have the upper hand for the time being. Swedes are, as a commentator put it, \"trusting and unflappable.\" 28 Since other governments cannot perfectly replicate Sweden's approach, they are left with the choice of doing what they see best and being selective with the truth in their communications with the citizenry. 29 Lying for benevolent reasons, shunned as it is, may be the only realistic way forward, when countries like Germany begin to remove the restrictions purposefully and methodically. 30 Apart from the potentially dubious moral philosophy, though, this is not necessarily a route that can be travelled more than once. 31 The Finnish example of presenting recommendations to the elderly in a form that could be interpreted as legal orders and prohibitions is a case in point. Now that the over 70s know, after media exposure, that the government may have overstated their case, people are prone to be more cautious. This brings us back to the premise of my narrative. If we want to live in liberal democracies, and if liberal democracies gain our trust by nurturing principles like openness and transparency, is mispresenting the truth, or hiding the fact that we do not know the truth, ever the right answer? If it is not, then I am left with this disconcerting question: Do citizens need better liberal democracy or do liberal democracies need better citizens?",
