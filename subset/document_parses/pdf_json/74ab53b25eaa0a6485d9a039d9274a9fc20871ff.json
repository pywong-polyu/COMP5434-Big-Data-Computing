Factors associated with receiving tocilizumab were patients' age, gender, renal function, and treatment location. 630 patients were included in the propensity score-matched population, of whom 210 received tocilizumab and 420 did not receive tocilizumab. 358 (57%) of 630 patients died, 102 (49%) who received tocilizumab and 256 (61%) who did not receive tocilizumab. Overall median survival from time of admission was not reached (95% CI 23 days-not reached) among patients receiving tocilizumab and was 19 days (16-26) for those who did not receive tocilizumab (hazard ratio [HR] 0\u00b771, 95% CI 0\u00b756-0\u00b789; p=0\u00b70027). In the primary multivariable Cox regression analysis with propensity matching, an association was noted between receiving tocilizumab and decreased hospital-related mortality (HR 0\u00b764, 95% CI 0\u00b747-0\u00b787; p=0\u00b70040).

            "text": "Worldwide more than 20 million individuals have been infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus 2 (SARSCoV2), the coronavirus causing COVID19. As of Aug 13, 2020, almost 750 000 deaths have been reported globally. 1 Infection causes destruction of alveolar epithelial cells, activation of the innate immune sys tem, and dysregu lation of adaptive immune responses, includ ing release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemo kines. This socalled cytokine storm might have an important role in the progression to respiratory and multi organ failure. 2, 3 Tocilizumab, a recombinant monoclonal antibody against the interleukin (IL) 6 receptor, has been used to miti gate the cytokine release syndrome associated with chi meric antigen receptor (CAR) Tcell therapy and has been proposed as a potential therapy for the cytokine storm syndrome associated with severe COVID19 pneumonia based on small phase 2 studies. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Preliminary unpublished results of the phase 2 French CORIMUNOTOCI trial, involving 129 patients, noted a reduction in mortality and requirement for mechanical ventilation in patients who received tocilizumab. 11 A large multinational randomised placebocontrolled phase 3 trial evaluating tocilizumab in the treatment of severe COVID19 pneu monia is under way (NCT04320615). Additional trials of tocilizumab are also ongoing.",

Exposure to tocilizumab was defined as receipt of the drug as found in the electronic health record. If no evidence of tocilizumab administration was found, we recorded that the patient had not received tocilizumab. Offlabel use of tocilizumab within the Hackensack Meridian Health network was guided by the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee, with recommendations to consider treatment in patients with evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome on mechanical ven tila tion, or worsening oxygenation with high oxygen requirements (80-100%) on highflow nasal cannula or 15 L non rebreather mask. Symptoms had to be present for 7 days and documentation of informed consent was needed. However, the final decision to use tocilizumab was at the discretion of the treating clinician. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee suggested one intravenous dose of 400 mg tocilizumab. A randomised placebocontrolled trial of tocilizumab was available at one academic centre within the Hackensack Meridian Health network (Hackensack University Medical Center, Hackensack, NJ, USA). The rationale for selection of the 400 mg intravenous dose of tocilizumab was based on published work from China, 6 albeit preclinical and not peer reviewed at that time, which showed improved oxygenation using a dose of tociliz umab around 4 mg/kg. A second dose of tocilizumab was permitted at the point of worsen ing oxygenation (eg, increased oxygen [O 2 ] require ment, high flow O 2 ) and before mechan ical ven tilation, with adminis tration at the treating clinician's discretion.",

A propensity scorematched population was constructed of 630 patients, 210 who received at least one infusion of tocilizumab and 420 who did not receive tocilizumab. The propensity scorematched population was well balanced except with respect to nursing home residents ( Of 210 patients in the propensity scorematched population who received tocilizumab, 206 (98%) received 400 mg flat dosing, two (1%) received 8 mg/kg, and two (1%) received other doses; 185 (88%) received one infu sion and 25 (12%) received a second infusion. Tocilizumab was administered a median of 9 days (IQR 6-12) after the start of patientreported symptoms, a median of 3 days (1-7) from the date of hospitalisation, and a median of 0 days (0-2) from the date of ICU support.",

However, we administered a lower dose of tocilizumab (a 400 mg flat dose as a onetime infusion in most patients) by contrast with 8 mg/kg dosing used in the ongoing, international, randomised placebocontrolled trial. An increase in use of hydroxychloroquine was noted in patients who received tocilizumab compared with those who did not receive tocilizumab, which we do not believe had a relevant effect on our findings because most observational studies have not reported a benefit for hydroxychloroquine among hospitalised patients, despite potentially some activity in early SARSCoV2 infection. 29 Our observational study has limitations. First, obser vational studies cannot draw causal inferences because of inherent known and unknown confounders. We attempted to adjust for known confounders using our propensity scorematched approach. We also did several sensitivity analyses, including models with the propensity score as a covariate, models with stepwise selection of covariates based on the Akaike information criterion, and models selected by Lasso.

Our cohort had a high prevalence of comorbidities and were older, in the setting of an over burdened healthcare system, and represented the peak incidence of SARSCoV2 infec tion, which probably skewed our mortality rates higher than those reported in other cohorts.
