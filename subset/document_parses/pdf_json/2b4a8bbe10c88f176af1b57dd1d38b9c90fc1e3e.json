A golden evidence triangle fusing the views of three respondent groups was established to assess trustworthy digital-free tourism-character strength linkages. Nine strengths were commonly acknowledged. They were distributed across a three-layer tiered model according to their relative importance. The strengths developed in digital-free tourism include: self-regulation, appreciation of beauty and excellence, social intelligence and open-mindedness for the core layer; vitality, love and perspective for the secondary layer; spirituality and creativity for the peripheral layer. The roles of each verified strength and the mechanisms for developing character strengths in digital-free tourism were captured in a three-stage travel narrative.",

For example, humour has been found to be helpful for tourists to better connect with others and cope with difficult or stressful travel situations (Pearce & Pabel, 2015) .

Choosing a DFT holiday in itself may be a character building exercise involving managing expectations and conquering doubts. At the second stage: during travel, the digital-free holiday environments require and encourage tourists to make use of their existing strengths to cope with the disconnected situations. For example, consider the characteristic of persistence. Even for tourists who view DFT merely as an opportunity to relax, they need to depend on themselves and utilise their own strengths to adapt to such extraordinary situations. In DFT situations, such as finding the way, persistence may be sharpened because the duration of the DFT may not permit the use of a familiar resource such as Google Maps, and persisting with hand held maps and asking others for orientation may be needed. Similarly, other quite novel situations involving communicating with strangers may require fresh responses and behaviours to deal with the situation, thus resulting in acquiring new strengths. Potentially, some of the strengths identified may endure after the holiday and be employed to deal with tasks in daily routines. Fig. 1 portrays these possibilities. This conceptual framework will guide the researchers to categorise strengths into the three stages: pre-, during and post-travel. J. Li, et al. Annals of Tourism Research 85 (2020) 103037",

As individuals, the researchers remain equivocal about the nature and extent of the benefits of digital-free tourism and this positionality prompts our attention to recording and respecting respondents' diverse views about any kinds of positive outcomes of the activity (Caton, 2012) . A constructivist paradigm therefore fits the needs of the study as it is built on a subjectivist epistemology and a relativist ontology (Dann, 1997; Jennings, 2010) . These underlying principles defining a constructivist paradigm foster the use of naturalistic methods such as interviews, reading of what people write, and analysing open-ended comments, as well as requiring explicit expression of the researchers' position.",

It has been widely used for designing, improving and evaluating the impacts of products and services in various fields, such as medical science, education and management (Briner et al., 2009) . The golden evidence triangle is especially useful in designing and implementing emerging and innovative practices, such as DFT. The approach is also sometimes known as respondent triangulation (Gomm, 2004) . Briner et al. (2009) asserts that by using the triangular approach, reliability of the findings about a topic are enhanced through conscientious, explicit and astute application of the sources of information. The approach incorporates a critical evaluation of research evidence, practitioner expertise and judgement, and the perspectives and values of those people who are directly or indirectly affected. In this study, IT and tourism academics provided research evidence; DFT providers contributed professional expertise and J. Li, et al. Annals of Tourism Research 85 (2020) 103037 judgement; tourists who have experienced DFT are exactly those direct beneficiaries. Fig. 2 displays the three sources of information for the potential links between DFT situations and development of character strengths. We located tourists having personally experienced DFT through visiting their blogs about digital detoxing. DFT provider informants were found by reading online advertisements for DFT and contacting representatives of the business. Authors of highly cited publications studying ICT-tourism relationships were contacted as academic informants. Some of the contacted tourists recommended others who had experienced in DFT; providers also helped contact their customers as tourist informants. Criteria for informant selection were: tourists must have experienced of at least 4 h of digital-free time when having a holiday away home; providers must be running DFT programs; and academics must have published research on the relationship between tourism and ICT. Four hours were selected as the threshold for the definition of DFT because it covers a whole period of a morning, afternoon or evening, arguably each of which is long enough to produce the impulse to check on digital devices. Next, we emailed the expected informants an invitation message followed by an information sheet, a consent form, and the URL of a Qualtrics web-based questionnaire from 30 January to 5 May in 2018.",

The participants scoring over 1 for both scores are designated hereafter as the informants for the study. The filter enabled 80.25% of all participants to be included as informants. As a minor variant, one tourist was incorporated although he/she chose 1 on the second scale; because this tourist wrote extensively about the benefits tourists could obtain from DFT in answers to open-ended questions. Generally, key informants reported that they perceived very high levels of ICT overuse among tourists and acknowledged the significance of DFT. See informants' evaluation in Table 1 .",

Moreover, the behavioural trends in descriptions that reflected the strength of interest were also coded to capture the ways informants described various strengths in DFT situations. Examples drawn from these data are as follow: \"Abilities to communicate and form real personal relationships with others\" (Tourist 3), \"Kids learn better how to socialise, and I will need to develop communication skills to interact with local people\" (Tourist 23) and \"Socialisation, communication skills, and teamworking\" (Academic 4) (all coded as Social Intelligence); \"Being without technology on holiday would really show you how little you actually need to be dependent on technology\" (Provider 2), \"It may teach us what really is important in our life, and I learnt was that I do not have to compare myself to others on Instagram\" (Tourist 31) (all coded as Perspective). Analysis of the links between DFT and development of tourists' character strengths was conducted based on the frequency and repetitiveness of each strength code. Specifically, the frequency of each character strength can be represented by the number of key informants who referred to this strength in their answers. Repetitiveness is defined by the median number of times that a strength appeared in each key informant's response.

The changes of DFT tourists' emotion are depicted in existing research, from withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, frustration, and loneliness, to enjoyment Chen et al., 2018) . In our study, such processes of adaption and acceptance were also reported by informants. For example, the owner of a digital-detox Airbnb observed that: \"While they (customers) were anxious at first about separating from their phones, it took less than 24 hours for the positive changes to occur\". Moreover, how the strength of regulating emotions worked to help tourists adapt to DFT and enjoy the peace was identified in tourists' responses. For example, a Chinese tourist who spent a week-long holiday at a Zen retreat centre wrote: \"At the beginning, I was worried about missing out on messages and emails but thought of my phone less and less after reminding myself to relax, calm down\". In addition, the strength developed in DFT continues to function after travel; one parent wrote: \"We found our kids were not as restless as when they were previously deprived of phones and IPads; they learned to regulate their emotion through the digitaldetoxing.\"",

The enhancement of sustainability was confirmed by tourists' comments, such as \"I could foster my mental well-being and energize my body\". In particular, in line with the findings from previous research (Dickinson et al., 2016) , encouraging children to engage in outdoor activities and teamwork is an important reason why parents, educators and academics endorse DFT. An academic wrote: \"The results of participating in such a process not only builds cognitive skills, but also activity routines (relating to muscular movement) and affective components (relating to moods, feelings, and attitudes). Hence, it will provide deeper and more personal impressions about what they have learned, and stimulate consciousness of social values for selfgrowth and post trip wellbeing.\"",

Firstly, we contribute to knowledge about DFT by outlining the mechanisms for building positive personal traits. Understanding such self-development outcomes extends investigations about the DFT experience, from motivations and emotional responses to long-term and fundamental impacts with links to the broader leisure, psychology and sociology literature. Arguably, DFT has the potential to provide restorative and transformative tourist experience; therefore, our findings can shed light on studies of transformational experiences and restorative destinations (Kirillova et al., 2017; Lehto, 2013) . Secondly, the identified potential of DFT in developing character strengths contributes to the literature in positive psychology by offering an alternative method for promoting positive emotions and psychological resilience. There are also interesting possibilities to link the work on coping with DFT to the tradition of exploring the value of perseverance in studies documenting success built on the concept of grit (Cred\u00e9, Tynan, & Harms, 2017) . Additionally, it has been established in previous positive psychology literature that development of character strengths contributes to tourists' well-being and improves individuals' quality-of-life (Park et al., 2004; Peterson et al., 2007) . Therefore, research on DFT benefits also contributes to the literature on well-being and quality-of-life by providing potential pathways for living a good life.",
