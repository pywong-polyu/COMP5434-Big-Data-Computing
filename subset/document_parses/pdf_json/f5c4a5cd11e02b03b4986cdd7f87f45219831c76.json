            "text": "Background: YouTube\u2122 (\"YouTube\") is often used as an educational tool to instruct anesthesia providers on regional anesthesia nerve blocks. However, there is no current objective standard to assess the educational quality of these user-uploaded videos. A new approach was used to objectively validate these videos by comparing them to high quality educational sources for the seven most commonly used nerve blocks. Objective: We sought to evaluate the educational quality of user-uploaded videos when compared to the highest quality anesthesia society websites (NYSORA, ACEP, USRA). Methods: After reviewing the instructional material available for the seven most frequently conducted nerve blocks on high-quality reference websites, we documented the educational characteristics present including such things as indications, volume, anatomy, etc. Next we reviewed the five most popular videos on YouTube for each block (by views) and documented the presence or absence of these educational characteristics. Results: Eighteen educational characteristics were documented in the \"high-quality\" anesthesia society reference material. Correlation was sought between this material and YouTube videos. Although there were varying degrees of correlation between the high quality sources and the videos, rarely did YouTube videos contain as high a percentage of these educational characteristics as the well-established sources. Some videos contained very few of these important educational characteristics. Conclusion: Although YouTube has been used an educational tool, we recommend that only high quality sources be used to teach or illustrate regional anesthesia nerve blocks.",

Numerous medical procedures and clinical skills instructional videos can be found quickly, changing the landscape of medical education [2, 4] . Students and providers alike are turning to social media platforms to augment classroom learning and refresh clinical skills [3, 4] . While access to these videos is nearly instantaneous, every piece of content must be used with the awareness that it is often neither peer reviewed nor certified for accuracy [2] [3] [4] . However, non-peer reviewed periodicals, websites, conferences and social media have been noted to be sources some healthcare professionals turn to prior to seeking out peer-reviewed material [2] . Nonetheless, many YouTube videos providing misinformation have been reported, leading to potential dangers to patients, and compromising providers' credibility if used as the sole source of information [1, 5, 6] .",

The least included category in the YouTube videos was \"references\". Only 6 of the 35 (17.1%) videos evaluated by the research team referenced primary sources. \"Guide for catheter placement\" (40%) and \"Atlas picture of anatomy\" (48.6%) were the second and third least referenced categories included in all YouTube videos reviewed. Table 2 compares and contrasts the differences in percentage of educational characteristics found in educational material between the 3 anesthesia societies (NYSORA, USRA and ACEP) compared to the YouTube videos. This is broken down by each of the individual 7 nerve blocks reviewed for this study. As is evident in the table, none of the reference material for the 7 blocks contains less than 94.4% of the educational categories in the anesthesia society reference material. Compare that to the YouTube videos, which range as low as 68.9% for the popliteal nerve block videos and no higher than 90.0% for the interscalene nerve block instructional videos. (Note: ACEP TAP block was omitted for statistical calculations, as they did not provide any instructional content for this particular block).",

For students and young physicians, consulting the content published by the established authorities on regional anesthesia to learn foundational knowledge for each nerve block would be most advisable. YouTube likely cannot replace trusted sources for primary information, such as NYSORA, ACEP and USRA. However, there may be a role in consulting further video content after the provider has knowledge and experience with the procedure to evaluate different techniques or refresh their skills.",
