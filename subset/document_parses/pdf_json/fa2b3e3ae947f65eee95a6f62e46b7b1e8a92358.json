ESD provided to acute stroke patients has been widely researched. Langhorne and Baylan [5] carried out a Cochrane review of 17 randomised control trials (RCT's) providing ESD interventions in acute stroke care. An average reduction of six days (MD = -5.5; 95% CI -3 to -8 days; P < 0.0001) in hospital LoS was found in the intervention group and reduced admissions to long term care facilities (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.96, P = 0.02). No clear differences were seen in terms of activities of daily living (ADL's) or patients' subjective health status or mood. ESD has also been explored in a respiratory population in a feasibility study by Collins, Eneje [6] . In this review, the ESD intervention was provided to patients deemed to be of moderate disability. Typically, ESD teams had approximately 3.1 Whole Time Equivalent (WTE) staff. The composition of staff varied across studies but broadly comprised-medical 0.1 WTE, nursing (range from 0 to 1.2 WTE), physiotherapy 1 WTE, occupational therapy 1 WTE, speech and language therapy 0.3 WTE, therapy assistant 0.4 WTE. Variable levels of social work (range 0 to 0.5 WTE) and secretarial support were also available. Team input began on day one post discharge, with four to five therapy sessions provided weekly for a maximum of three months.",

The intervention led by a consultant geriatrician, involved services provided by nursing staff, health care assistants and allied healthcare professionals.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 RCT's by Rodakowski, Rocco [8] demonstrated that involving caregivers in the discharge process can reduce hospital readmission risk by up to 24% 180 days postdischarge. In a qualitative study by Georgiadis and Corrigan [9] exploring patient and caregiver experiences of discharge from an acute hospital, both patients and their caregivers were more likely to report negative experiences if they had limited involvement in the discharge process. Patients also report that they felt their concerns of premature discharge were not listened to. Given the positive outcomes of involving caregivers in the discharge process for older adults, ESD would facilitate caregiver involvement to allow for a shared decision-making process between the patient, their caregiver(s), and the healthcare team.",

Zhu, Liu [24] carried out a systematic review and metaanalysis investigating nurse-led discharge planning interventions for inpatients with complex chronic disease or rehabilitation needs. This review of 10 RCT's (n = 3438) found there to be statistically significant reductions in hospital readmissions, readmission LoS and all-cause mortality in those in the intervention groups versus control groups. While the interventions included in this review were not exclusively MDT led as is the case with ESD interventions, they illustrate the positive impacts discharge interventions can have on both process and clinical outcomes as well as the feasibility of ESD interventions being run in practice.",

They received an MDT based intervention in their homes, which began within 48 h of their hospital discharge. Despite the small number of participants in the home-based group and the data collection for the trial stopping early due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the median physical activity levels were significantly higher (p < 0.001) and median sedentary behaviour levels significantly lower (p < 0.001) in the home-based group even after matching. None of the studies in our review chose to include physical activity levels as an outcome for their ESD interventions.

While these guidelines were targeted to all adults and not just those aged \u2265 65 years, they do recommend a dedicated discharge co-ordinator be assigned to each patient with care needs along with supported discharge including home care and community-based rehabilitation. Of the studies included in this review, Harris, Ashton [19] was the only one to assign a case manager to facilitate discharge for the participants. Specifically focusing on discharging older adults from the New Zealand acute hospital setting to home, Harris, Ashton [19] noted that further research was required to assess the cost-effectiveness of community-based interventions. Similarly, NICE recommended extending research to assess the effectiveness of home interventions post discharge. A systematic review carried out by Zhu, Liu [24] investigating nurse-led discharge programmes for older adults with chronic conditions reported similar findings -an absence of discharge interventions guidelines but the potential for ESD style interventions to reduce LoS and overall costs to the health system. As per this review, discharge interventions such as ESD, have potential to meet the unmet needs of older adults as outlined by NICE.",

A Cochrane review of 29 studies (n = 13,766) carried out in 2017 found that older adults who received CGA in hospital were more likely to be in their own home at a 12 month follow up when compared to usual care (RR 1.06, 95% CI 1.01 to 1.10) [31] . The evidence for cost-effectiveness was inconsistent and imprecise across studies. Furthermore, the review noted that little detail was provided on what interventions are provided after the assessment phase of a CGA. Given that ESD interventions were typically provided by MDT members with specialist geriatric interest and training, it aligns with CGA as a continuation of care. While CGA is not explicitly designed to reduce an older adult's acute hospital LoS, it can help in keeping older adults at home for longer through identifying a variety of treatable health problems and ultimately lead to better health outcomes. Older adults have reported that continuing to live in their home is influenced by historical, cultural and environmental contexts which shapes their everyday thoughts, activities and what was meaningful for them [32] . ESD can promote independence at home for older adults post hospital admission by allowing them to rehabilitate at home, creating meaningful goals [33] . Given the synergy between the models of care, future research could look to the integration of the two services and their effect on patient, process, and cost outcomes.",

In a similar population Georgiadis and Corrigan [9] highlighted the need for families and caregivers to be involved in an older adults discharge plan, with negative experiences of discharge planning linked to a lack of communication and engagement with their healthcare teams.

No statistically significant effects were seen favouring ESD interventions (n = 324) versus control groups (n = 327), (REM, SMD = 1.71, 95% CI -1.57 to 4.98, I 2 = 100%, P = 0.31), see Additional File 5, supplementary Fig. 2. Cognition was measured by Caplan, Coconis [20] and Harris, Ashton [19] using the MMSE. No statistically significant effects were seen in the ESD group when compared to the control groups (FEM, MD = -0.47, 95% CI -1.21 to 0.25, I 2 = 0%, P = 0.21), see Additional File 5, Supplementary Fig. 3. There were no significant differences across the groups in the incidence of admission to long term care (LTC) (FEM, RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.65 to 1.22, I 2 = 0%, P = 0.93) and hospital readmissions (FEM, RR 1.09, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.4, I 2 = 0%, P = 0.39) in the ESD group when compared to the control group, see Additional File 5, supplementary Figs. 4 and 5.
