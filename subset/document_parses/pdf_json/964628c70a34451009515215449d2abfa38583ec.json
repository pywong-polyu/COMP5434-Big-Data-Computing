To address this concern, universal (non-symptom-based) screening of HCWs was piloted to determine the proportion of SARS-CoV-2 infection and the associated epidemiological and clinical risk factors at a large public health care facility in Egypt. Methods: Baseline voluntary screening of 4040 HCWs took place between 22 April and 14 May 2020 at 12 hospitals and medical centres in Cairo. Epidemiological and clinical data were collected using an online survey. All participants were tested for SARS-CoV-2 using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid IgM and IgG serological tests. Results: Of the 4040 HCWs screened, 170 [4.2%; 95% confidence interval (CI): 3.6-4.9] tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 by either of the three tests (i.e. infected); 125/170 (73.5%) tested PCR-positive. Most infected HCWs were nurses (97/170, 57.5%). Median age of infected HCWs was 31.5 [interquartile range (IQR): 27.0-41.3] years. Of infected HCWs, 78 (45.9%) reported contact with a suspected case and 47 (27. 6%) reported face-to-face contact within 2 m with a confirmed case. The proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs (n \u00bc 54/616) was 8.8% (95% CI: 6.7-11.3); 6/54 (11.1%) had fever !38 C and 7/54 (13.0%) reported severe symptoms. Most infected HCWs were asymptomatic (116/170, 68.2%). The proportion of infection among asymptomatic HCWs (n \u00bc 116/3424) was 3.4% (95% CI: 2.8-4.0). Conclusions: The high rate of asymptomatic infections among HCWs reinforces the need for expanding universal regular testing. The infection rate among symptomatic HCWs in this study is comparable with the national rate detected through symptom-based testing. This suggests that infections among HCWs may reflect community rather than nosocomial transmission during the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic in Egypt.",

The baseline screening took place in the early phase of the COVID-19 epidemic; there were 3659 total cases in Egypt at screening launch (22 April). By the end of baseline screening (14 May), the cumulative infections through the nationally adopted symptom-based screening were 10 829 cases/135 000 PCR tests 24 (8.0%; 95% CI 7.9-8.2), comparable to the proportion of infection among symptomatic HCWs in the current study (8.8%). The onset of symptoms in infected ASU-HCWs during baseline screening follows the epidemic curve in the community, suggesting that infections may have been acquired through community rather than nosocomial transmission. This finding is consistent with observations in high-and upper-middle-income settings, such as the UK, 25 The Netherlands 5 and China. 2 In the early epidemic phase, 6% (86/1353) in two Dutch hospitals 5 and 5% (2/38) in the UK 25 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 among symptomatic HCWs, compared with 8.8% in this study. In the UK study, the infection rate increased to 20% at a later epidemic stage. 25 Evidence of asymptomatic carriage in HCWs was documented; two studies reported infection rates close to the 3.4% in this study: 3.9% of 2872 and 2.9% of 1032 asymptomatic HCWs tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the USA 26 and the UK, 27 respectively. Another UK study reported an initial rate of 7.1% (28/396) falling after 5 weeks to 1.1 (3/269). 11 More than two-thirds of the infected HCWs (116/170, 68.2%) in this study were asymptomatic at the time of screening. Others also documented asymptomatic carriage in HCWs (57%) 27 and non-HCWs (51.7%-87.9%). 9, 10, 28 This finding underscores the importance of relaxing the strategy of testing individuals, particularly HCWs, based on a strict clinical case definition, to accommodate asymptomatic or paucisymptomatic individuals.",

Implementing universal screening, however, is cost-saving and keeps the much-needed workforce active. The negotiated volume purchase price of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR and rapid serological tests used in this study was 50 USD per 22 it can yield high false-negative results. 29 Therefore, a risk stratification protocol for HCWs who tested negative with scheduled re-testing is recommended. 30 Serological tests were performed in this study to evaluate baseline seroprevalence and identify seroconversion at follow-up-not as a confirmatory test of HCWs' infection at baseline. Only 11/4040 (0.3%) HCWs in this study tested IgG-positive, indicating that infection was not yet widespread in ASU-HCWs in this early epidemic phase. The first identified COVID-19 HCW case was in the Obstetrics and Gynaecology hospital (4 April) only complaining of general malaise, and may have resulted in a cluster of infection among other HCWs, being paucisymptomatic. This might explain why the proportion of infection was higher in this hospital (7.1%) compared with Odds ratio (95% CI) were calculated using binary logistic regression. HCWs who were adherent to gown use in this study were more likely to be infected than those who were nonadherent. Occasional breaching of infection prevention and control (IPC) procedures and relaxed HCWs' attitudes towards the prohibited social gathering cannot be dismissed. Consistent use of PPEs can reduce the risk of infection among HCWs. 31 However, adequate PPE availability did not completely eliminate that risk in HCWs who were adherent to PPE use in the UK and the USA 32 ; adherence to proper use should be investigated. More mistakes were detected among nurses during donning or doffing PPEs in a Chinese hospital. 33 In this study, working as a nurse compared with a physician was independently associated with infection, which is consistent with previous findings. 34 Nurses are in contact with many colleagues and patients' relatives at the nurses' stations. Also, in ASU hospitals, many tasks still involve paperwork, mainly handled by nurses and exposing them to a higher possibility of infection. The time between infected HCWs' last contact with a confirmed case to the onset of symptoms ranged between 1 and 31 days, conforming with recent work estimating 5% of cases may take 2 weeks or more to develop symptoms. 13 HCWs' direct face-to-face interaction within 2 m with a confirmed COVID-19 case, but not the duration, was associated with a greater proportion of infection only in the bivariate analysis. Interestingly, more than half the infected HCWs did not report any contact with a COVID-19 case either in the workplace or at home, a proportion double that reported in previous studies. 5 Moreover, some infected HCWs reported contact with cases after several days from the onset of their symptoms, suggesting exposure to an asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic case, as infectivity peaks in the pre-symptomatic stage. 14 Several factors support that in-hospital transmission at this early epidemic stage was unlikely. Infection that could not be traced to a specific exposure may signal the stage of community transmission. 35 We found that SARS-CoV-2 infection among HCWs was independently associated with fever, dry cough and change/loss of smell. Another study reported these symptoms as predictors of a positive COVID-19 test with high specificity. 32 In this study, loss of smell was reported by only five HCWs, four of whom were infected. Also, six reported fever !38 C (11.1%) and most symptomatic cases showed only mild to moderate symptoms, a finding consistent with previous reports. 5, 28 Klutymans et al. suggested modifying the case definition for suspected HCWs by including fever as a possible-not as a requiredsymptom. 5 Pre-existing medical conditions among HCWs in this study were not associated with an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Approximately three-quarters of enrolled HCWs were younger than 40 years of age. Also, the data may have not have revealed independent associations, due to the small number of infected HCWs with comorbidities. A recent UK study reported that, apart from chronic kidney disease and obesity, none of the chronic conditions among 587 primary care patients were associated with positive SARS-CoV-2 tests. 36 Infected participants' relatively young age (median 31.5 years) may have also contributed to the high proportion of asymptomatic infections in the current study. Recent modelling work suggests an age-dependent effect in COVID-19 transmission 37 ; asymptomatic infections occur mostly in younger ages, which might partly explain why clinically apparent cases are lower in countries with predominantly young population structures, such as Egypt.",

The centrally located accredited laboratories in ASU expedited transfer of samples with a testing capacity of 500 samples per day. There were also dedicated trained teams responsible for screening. Notably, screening of HCWs should be periodic for early detection of infections-especially asymptomatic infections-and to assist decision makers in prompt management of the health care workforce. The preparations for baseline screening, including capacity building and training of hospital teams, may positively reflect on future hospital policies for communicable diseases and the preparedness for other epidemics. Costs, availability of tests, testing capacity and suitable laboratory facilities with skilled personnel are among many barriers to universal screening of HCWs in resource-limited settings. Therefore, developing accurate affordable rapid point-ofcare diagnostic tests is vital to the success and sustainability of this approach. Moreover, universal screening should be coupled with vigilant IPC measures to protect HCWs and hospitalized patients. Conversely, there is a unique opportunity in universal screening of HCWs; discovering asymptomatic infections will be critical in flattening the curve and preventing second waves which could result in staff shortages and the overwhelming of health care facilities, particularly in countries experiencing COVID-19 epidemic exponential growth.",

            "text": "As testing of HCWs was voluntary there was a possibility of self-selection bias. HCWs who thought they were at a higher risk of COVID-19 were more likely to participate for reassurance. The association between infected and symptomatic/asymptomatic status would most likely not be biased, though; if biased, the direction of bias would be underestimation of asymptomatic infections. Second, symptoms may have been over-reported, but the recall period was short and HCWs filled the online survey first and did not know the results of the tests, except later on. Third, comparison of HCWs' demographic and clinical characteristics with the nationwide confirmed cases was not possible because MoHP data were not publicly available. Since Egypt is currently experiencing exponential growth in the epidemic, changes in the proportion of infection among HCWs is expected to occur rapidly and this will be examined in the follow-up phase of this study. Fourth, the cross-sectional nature of the baseline screening does not allow drawing causal inferences. We were unable to validate whether asymptomatic HCWs were truly asymptomatic or were in the pre-symptomatic phase. This could be further investigated in longitudinal study designs. Also, evaluation of impact of the many interventions ASU adopted to mitigate nosocomial transmission of COVID-19 was not possible. Fifth, the online survey collected several data within the HCWs' limited time; the collection of behavioural risk factors and elaborate evaluation of IPCs was not feasible. Investigating temporal and spatial nosocomial transmission dynamics for SARS-CoV-2 infection, particularly in hospitals with a higher proportion of infections, was not possible. Sixth, the test sensitivity for lateral flow immunochromatographic antibody assay was poor (83%); therefore, the frequency of recovery from infection may have been under-reported. We faced some logistical challenges during implementation. Internet disruption caused delay in completing the online survey for 1 day, but this was overcome by using cellphone internet packages. There was HCW and consequently sample overflow into baseline screening on 2 days, exceeding the capacity of both the local screening and the laboratory teams, which was overcome by assigning additional shifts, teams and workstations.",

The rate of symptomatic infection in this study is comparable with the national rate in the early epidemic phase in Egypt, suggesting community-acquired rather than nosocomial infection. Universal screening-including symptomatic and asymptomatic HCWs-informed ASU policies for evidence-based management and updated local guidance for HCWs. Given the various success factors required for sustained implementation and regular testing, further evaluation of the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing such programmes is required in different resource-limited settings.",

Negative indicates contact before onset of symptoms others. The variability of infection rates among participating sites requires further investigation of the behavioural, personal and social characteristics associated with asymptomatic infection. HCWs occasionally work in multiple hospitals within ASU premises, and a few COVID-19 infected HCWs (6.5%) reported working in other hospitals. Tracking the trajectories of infected HCWs and tracing the viral genetic sequence may help determine the occurrence of cross-infection between health care facilities.Working in the operating theatre was independently associated with infection in this study. Close contact with colleagues and patients, emergency operations performed for life-saving conditions before excluding patient's infection, and procedures entailing aerosol generation and spilling of patients' body fluids, are among factors increasing the risk of infection, in addition to accidental damage of PPE during work and inappropriate sequence of donning and doffing.",
