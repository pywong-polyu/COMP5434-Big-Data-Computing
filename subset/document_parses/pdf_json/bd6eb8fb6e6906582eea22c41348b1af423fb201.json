Resistance calculated from decay rate and elastance ranged from 0.15 to 1.95 cmH 2 Os/L.

Occlusion resistance measurements were as expected for healthy subjects, and increased as expected as resistance was added.",

It is a simple and lowcost test which assesses lung health by analysing airflow and lung volume during specific breathing manoeuvres [1] [2] [3] . The results of spirometry are able to guide therapy, by indicating the type and severity of any lung condition present. However, underlying lung mechanics cannot be directly measured without further testing [4] . These mechanics are affected by lung disease, and monitoring how they change over time may provide a more accurate assessment of lung condition in response to therapy. Hence, there is a need to link easily obtained spirometry data with clinically and physiologically relevant lung mechanics models.",

The dynamic elastance measured during expiration represents a combination of the lung's elastic recoil and muscular expiratory effort.

When collating all shuttered breaths, outliers were defined as data greater than 1.5 standard deviations above the 75th or below the 25th percentile. In addition, the decay rate was not calculated if the decaying range identified contained less than 3 datapoints. No other methods were used to exclude data from analysis. Table 1 contains details of the decay rates measured for all subjects for all external resistance levels. Decay rates measured range from 0.1 to 48. Flow decay rate is inversely proportional to resistance. So as resistance is added to the system, measured decay rate is expected to decrease.

Generally, R rs was less than the value of added resistance alone. R rs does not increase proportional to added resistance, as had been expected. Expiratory elastance calculated by this test is presented as positive, due to the spirometer defining positive pressure as expiration. When pressure is typically measured for calculating lung mechanics, such as during mechanical ventilation, positive pressure is defined as inspiration. As such, the negative of elastance was used to separate resistance from decay rate. Table 4 shows ROCC calculated for each subject, and the effect of external resistance on ROCC is shown in Fig. 7 .

Elastance measured in this study generally fit into this expected range, indicating the majority of airflow could be attributed to lung elastic recoil. There was no consistent trend between measured elastance and added resistance. However, elastance tended to be slightly higher when external resistance was added. These results suggest external resistance and the use of shuttering may not significantly affect measured elastance, but some breath-to-breath elastance change should be expected. Elastance measured for Subjects 11, 13, 14, and 16 was higher than expected. For healthy, tidally breathing subjects, increased elastance indicates muscular breathing effort. The additional elastance due to muscular effort cannot be separated from static elastance without further measures. Hence, expiratory breathing effort during mechanics measurement could indicate restrictive disease where none is present. However, the measurement of combined elastance of tidal breathing may provide clinically relevant information. A larger than expected elastance during quiet tidal breathing indicates an elevated work-of-breathing, which could negatively impact quality of life.",

R rs was not significantly or consistently affected by added external resistance. Airflow begins in areas in the centre of airways with low skin friction effects. Because airflow induced by the shutter decays quickly, typically only 20-50 ml of air is involved. The small volume does not allow enough time for air to flow from higher friction areas, resulting in a poor airway resistance estimate.

BioMed Eng OnLine (2020) 19:32 additional measure of either R rs or E d is required to separate the combined mechanics of the decay rate [17] [18] [19] .Elastance is defined as the pressure in the lung per unit volume. Pressure measured while airflow is occluded will approximate the respiratory driving pressure. Hence, if muscular effort remains constant, the elastance after the shutter re-opens can be calculated from the pressure and volume measured momentarily before the shutter re-opens ( P 0 and V 0 , respectively):R rs was able to be separated from the decay rate after this elastance was calculated.Additionally, occlusion resistance (ROCC) was calculated following standard protocol [16, 20] . The gradient of pressure from 30 to 75 ms after the shutter was closed was extrapolated backwards to 15 ms before closure. The difference between this extrapolated pressure and the true pressure measurement at that time was divided by the airflow recorded at that time to produce an estimate for total airway resistance before occlusion.Due to minimum flow limits built into the shuttering software employed, lung mechanics were measured while panting. For each test, the shutter was activated 5 times with a minimum of 5 normal breaths recorded before shuttering. Extra resistance was added to the spirometer mouthpiece to simulate upper airway obstruction. The test was repeated twice at each resistance level. The resistances added were 0 (baseline), 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2 cmH 2 Os/L, respectively.",
