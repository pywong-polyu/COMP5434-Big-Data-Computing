Methods: The herbal formulae recommended by official guidelines for the treatment of COVID-19 are included in the present analysis. To describe the tendency of herbs to form a \"herb pair\", we computed the mutual information (MI) value and distance-based mutual information model (DMIM) score. We also performed modularity, degree, betweenness, and closeness centrality analysis. Network analyses were performed and visualized for each disease stage. Results: A total of 142 herbal formulae comprising 416 herbs were analyzed. All possible herbal pairs were examined, and the top frequently used herbal pairs were identified for each disease stage. The herb Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma is only identified in one herb pair, even though this herb is identified as one of the herbs with high frequency of use for every disease stage. This suggests that the DMIM score could be used to identify the optimal combination rule of herbal formulae by achieving a balance among the herbs' frequency and relative distance in herbal formulae. Conclusion: Our results presented the prescription patterns and herbal combinations of the herbal formulae recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. This study may provide new insights and ideas for clinical research in the future.",

It has been reported that herbal medicines could be considered an alternative approach for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19. 2, 3 Recent systematic review articles also concluded that herbal medicine showed significant effects in increasing the total effective rate and alleviating the symptoms. [4] [5] [6] Network science is a field where complex networks are studied and represented by nodes and edges. 7 Network analysis, derived from network science, uses the mathematical language of graph theory to depict relationships among analyzed variables, and such analyses are often presented using visualization techniques. 8 In recent years, network analysis has been used in the field of complementary and alternative medicine. Several acupuncture studies used complex network analysis to examine the distribution pattern of acupoints selection and the regularities of acupoint combinations. 9, 10 Herbal studies also integrate complex network analysis techniques to investigate herb-target interactions and herbal combination regularities among herbal formulae. [11] [12] [13] [14] In this study, we applied network analysis to determine the prescription pattern and combination of herbs used in the herbal formulae recommended for the treatment of COVID-19. To analyze the distribution pattern of herbs, we computed the data extracted from available treatment guidelines and visualized the network based on each disease stage.",

            "text": "For both mild and moderate stages, the herb Armeniacae semen amarum was the most frequently recommended. Based on our findings, we inferred that most herbal formulae recommended in the mild and moderate stages are modified using \"Ma Xing Shi Gan\" decoction as the basic formula. \"Ma Xing Shi Gan\" decoction has been reported to have a broad spectrum of inhibitory activity against the entry of the influenza virus and have a significant effect of reducing pulmonary inflammation. 21,22 \"Ma Xing Shi Gan\" decoction is composed of four herbs including Ephedrae herba, Armeniacae semen amarum, Gypsum fibrosum, and Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma. A study exploring the active compounds of Ephedrae herba found several key components such as \u03b2-sitosterol, estrone, and stigmasterol have potential therapeutic effects on viral-induced respiratory infections. 23 Wang et al also revealed that Armeniacae semen amarum has nine active compounds regulating eight targets, with amygdalin as the major effective component and a candidate compound for COVID-19 treatment. 24 The herb Gypsum fibrosum is also shown to have an antipyretic effect with calcium as its main active component. 25 A study by Niu et al also identified that compounds such as quercetin, glabridin, and gallic acid present in Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma may regulate angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for the treatment of COVID-19. 26 For the severe stage of COVID-19, the herbs with high frequency of prescription were partly warm-natured and partly cold-natured herbs, including herbs with an extreme-warm-nature and extreme-cold-nature. These herbs can be primarily classified into lung, spleen, and heart meridians. The main TM therapeutic principle can be characterized as clearing heat, dispelling phlegm, and opening the orifices, corresponding to the symptoms of severe COVID-19 such as pneumonia (ie due to heat), comatose due to respiratory failure and shock (ie due to excessive phlegm and closing of orifices). According to a retrospective cohort study, the most frequently observed complication in COVID-19 patients is sepsis, followed by multiple organ failure, and septic shock. 27 This elucidates our findings as the high frequency of recommendation and pairing of herbs in the severe stage are mainly compositions of herbal medicines like \"Angong Niuhuang\" pill, \"Zhi Bao Dan\", \"Zi Xue San\", and \"Su He Xiang\" pill, which are frequently prescribed during life-threatening conditions. Among the top herbs used in the severe stage, Bubali cornu has also shown to have antipyretic 28 and Aconiti lateralis radix praeparata has played a potential role in treating heart failure due to its high alkaloid contents. 29 For the recovery stage, the herbs with high frequency of prescription were mainly warm-natured and can be classified as lung and spleen meridians. The main TM therapeutic principle can be summarized as tonifying qi and resolving dampness. In this stage, the symptoms are often milder after treatment, where the fever has subsided and respiratory symptoms, such as a cough or shortness of breath, have improved. Hence, the recommended herbs and TM therapeutic principles during the recovery process are focused on nourishing the body and improving prolonged mild symptoms. A study by Ko et al reveals that tonifying herbs such as Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma, Ophiopogonis radix, Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma, Codonopsis radix, and Pseudostellariae radix could enhance ATP-generation capacity. 30 This also corresponds with our findings as these herbs are also among the top frequently used herbs in the recovery stage. In addition, we found that the herbs with the highest frequency of use for every stage in our analysis comprised of the composition of herbs in the \"Qingfei Paidu\" decoction. The \"Qingfei Paidu\" decoction is a basic herbal formula consisting of 21 herbs included in the Chinese treatment guidelines as the primarily recommended formula that applies to all stages of COVID-19. The \"Qingfei Paidu\" decoction is reported to have 129 active compounds that can act on many targets to inhibit the entry and replication of SARS-CoV-2, suggesting a potential effect in treating COVID-19. 22, 31, 32 Recent studies have shown that the \"Qingfei Paidu\" decoction has significant effects on alleviating the symptoms and reducing multi-organ failure in COVID-19. [33] [34] [35] Notably, \"Ma Xing Shi Gan\" decoction is part of the fundamental composition in the \"Qingfei Paidu\" decoction and may contribute to the overall efficacy of the \"Qingfei Paidu\" decoction. 22 Hence, we believe that the \"Qingfei Paidu\" decoction comprised of the herbs with high frequency of use across all disease stages and the modification of \"Ma Xing Shi Gan\" decoction, which is also the core herbal composition of \"Qingfei Paidu\" decoction, is the main herbal formula recommended for treatment of COVID-19.",

As there are numerous herb pairs with similar DMIM scores across the disease stage, we are unable to identify the herb pair with the highest potential in treating COVID-19. However, we found that the four herbs of \"Ma Xing Shi Gan\" decoction including Ephedrae herba, Armeniacae semen amarum, Gypsum fibrosum, and Glycyrrhizae radix et rhizoma seem to each play a potential role in every stage of COVID-19. Future studies may consider focusing on the mechanism and metabolic pathway for these herbs for the treatment of COVID-19. We hope that this study may provide insights and research ideas for related clinical research in the future.",
