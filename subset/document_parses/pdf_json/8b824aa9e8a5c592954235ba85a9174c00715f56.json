Although not the focus of this review, Cariou reported a larger effect size (OR 3.19, 95% CI 2.09-4.87) for diabetic nephropathy than severe DR (OR 2.05, 95% CI 1.03-4.07) in univariate analysis for death on day 7. McGurnaghan had a slightly greater effect size for albuminuria than for referable DR at multivariate analysis. Additionally, both had larger sample sizes for nephropathy than for DR which may be a due to nephropathy presenting earlier or that it is more commonly measured.

Moreover, with regards to CCU treated COVID-19, McGurnaghan reported the OR for referable retinopathy as higher than that for BMI, hypertension and total cholesterol. Regarding comparison to macrovascular diseases, Wargny reported a greater OR for microvascular disease. This was also the case regarding heart failure.

Variability of outcomes is emerging as a common feature of COVID-19 literature [33] . Due to the need for rapid accumulation of data to guide appropriate responses to the pandemic, studies were organised quickly and conducted using varying methodology. However, reliable changes to clinical practice require reproducible and widely accepted outcomes to allow for efficient data sharing and pooling between studies. Consequently, the WHO have recommended a core set of outcome measures to define poor COVID-19 outcomes for future studies. These include death data collected up until 60 days or discharge, and the use of a WHO Clinical Progression Scale [33] .",

Although evidence is limited to determine whether this is linked to poorer prognosis, it is still important to distinguish the two to prevent confounding the analysis. Unfortunately, this could only be confidently concluded in the McGurnaghan and Corcillo studies, due to their use of the prevalent annual UK DR screening program. Furthermore, data collection methods must be up to date to ensure patients with underlying DR are appropriately captured.

Future studies would add considerably to the evidence base by reporting standardised outcomes. Work is urgently needed by health organisations to explicitly define standard outcome measures for epidemiological work in the context of rapidly evolving public health emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Other microvascular diseases, particularly nephropathy, may have better predictive value than DR, however further research is warranted. Nonetheless, DR remains the most easily accessible diabetic microvascular disease to measure and may continue to play a key role as an efficient, objective, quantitative biomarker. Although demographic factors have played an important role in characterising severe COVID-19 risk and aid in the management of the pandemic, microvascular disease may be more significant. There is now an opportunity to refine risk estimates with patient data that may relate more closely to the mechanisms of disease. We believe that an index of microvascular health may be an important complementary tool for patient stratification and monitoring pathways.",
