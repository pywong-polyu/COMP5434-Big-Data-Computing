In this opinion piece, we have used seven iterative methodological steps (including literature review, ranking, and sorting exercises) to create the proposed research agenda. We identified six main themes that we believe need attention in future research: (1) responsible evaluation of research and researchers, (2) the influence of open science and transparency on RRP, (3) research on responsible mentoring, supervision, and role modeling, (4) the effect of education and training on RRP, (5) checking for reproducibility, and (6) responsible and fair peer review. These themes have in common that they address aspects of research that are mostly on the level of the scientific system, more than on the level of the individual researcher. Some current initiatives are already gathering substantial empirical evidence to start filling these gaps. We believe that with sufficient support from all relevant stakeholders, more progress can be made.",

            "text": "While academic research is generally recognized as an institute of crucial importance to the well-being of our contemporary society, concerns over its functioning are growing. The current coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic especially highlights the need for more open and collaborative research practices. Stakeholders from within and outside the academic community are increasingly worried about issues regarding research funding, the scientific publication system, research evaluation practices, and academic career trajectories. Fueled by several highly visible cases of scientific misconduct-both before the COVID-19 outbreak and during the current pandemic (Callaway, 2011; Mehra et al., 2020) -there is a growing awareness that the results of scientific research should be reliable, that research practices should be responsible, and that the workflows and results of research need to be transparent. While media coverage has mainly centered on large fraud cases, the research community has acknowledged that fundamental causes of current issues are embedded in more systemic aspects of evaluating, rewarding, and disseminating research (Biagioli et al., 2019; Bramstedt, 2020; Fleming et al., 2020) . Experts of research integrity are convinced that, on an aggregate level, factors such as detrimental research practices, lack of supervision and mentoring, the system of research with hypercompetition, unidimensional assessment criteria, an individualistic research culture, and publication pressure are more threatening to the reliability and validity of research than (arguably rare) cases of misconduct (Begley & Ioannidis, 2015; Fanelli et al., 2015; Martinson et al., 2010) . This has led to a shift in focus towards research on responsible research practices (RRP). The increased attention for this subject is reflected by the large number of international initiatives from various stakeholders to foster RRP (e.g., The Research on Research Institute, the Meta-Research Innovation Center at Stanford [METRICS] ). These initiatives have mainly emerged from the biomedical sciences and psychology, and there is now an increasing need for initiatives tailored to other research disciplines and cultures (Haven et al., 2019b; Horbach & Halffman, 2019) .",

Initial interest in this field was mainly in defining research integrity and gaining more insight in the different forms of research misbehaviors, leading to classifications of major and minor forms of misbehaviors (falsification, fabrication, and plagiarism and questionable research practices [QRPs], respectively; [Bouter et al., 2016; Steneck, 2006] ). In addition, ample attention has been paid to estimating the frequency of transgressions and analyzing individual cases (Fanelli, 2009; John et al., 2012; van der Heyden et al., 2009) . Repeatedly, boundaries between research integrity and research ethics have been questioned in this debate with other concepts such as responsible research and innovation prominently coshaping discussion on research integrity. This has led us to adhere to a broad interpretation of \"research integrity\" including aspects that some may classify as research ethics. The scope of our concepts and paper will be further clarified in the methods section, which is added as Supplemental file Appendix I.",

Its ultimate aim is to serve as a starting point for future research agendas and more broadly for the international research field on research integrity and RRP. However, the current document is slightly focused on the Dutch context. This is partly due to the fact that the current debate on responsible research in the Netherlands was sparked by the high-profile fraud case of Diederik Stapel. Stapel was a professor of social psychology who fabricated data in over 50 published articles. The case itself triggered a plethora of Dutch initiatives to foster RRP (Abma, 2013) . This also included initiatives from funding agencies such as the European Union in their H2020 program, the Office of Research Integrity in the United States, the funder ZonMw in the Netherlands, and the Welcome Trust in the United Kingdom, establishing multiple funding programs (e.g., [Replication Studies, 2019; Research on Research, 2020] ). In these programs, several researchers are currently working on and assessing initiatives that foster RRP. Although we have tried to incorporate an international perspective, we found several initiatives from the Netherlands. Since the Dutch health funding organization was one of the first funding organizations that started funding on research integrity and numerous initiatives have been initiated in the Netherlands, the Netherlands can be considered one of the frontrunners in the area of initiatives and research fostering RRP, we believe this focus constitutes an appropriate lens to inventories state-of-the-art developments in the field. The progressive atmosphere in the Netherlands regarding research and initiatives on RRP is among others exemplified in several grant schemes by national funders related to this topic, as well as the early establishment of a national committee on research integrity. In our endeavors to establish a research agenda, we first summarize the current state of research on RRP and provide a conceptual overview of initiatives to foster RRP. Second, we identify major gaps of knowledge in the field of research on RRP that need to be addressed. This builds to a research agenda in which we classify the most pressing themes that need further study. With this knowledge, we aim to inform policymakers and funders on current issues for RRP. The paper thereby complements recent initiatives that have inventarised research on specific aspects related to RRP, such as peer review and research integrity (Aubert Bonn & Pinxten, 2019; Tennant & Ross-Hellauer, 2020) .",

These initiatives cover all aspects of the scientific \"empirical process\" and are in differing stages of development and acceptance by researchers. In this section, we categorize the main types of initiatives and sketch the current state-of-the-art of RRP. A list of concrete examples of initiatives can be found in Supplemental file Appendix II, whereby we acknowledge that the list is not exhaustive and may overlook other initiatives. RRP effectively encompasses the entire scientific ecosystem from overarching frameworks to the implementation system to the research process (Mejlgaard et al., 2020) . In Figure 1 , we have framed RRP as an overarching theme consisting of these three different levels: scientific frameworks; the scientific system; the empirical cycle. We are aware that we focus on research adhering to a research paradigm following the empirical cycle and thus put less emphasis on other methodologies. Other ways to structure our data could have been chosen, for instance a framework based on Latour and Woolgar's credibility cycle. Our choice for structuring the data along the empirical cycle is not so much because we believe it is the best way to describe research in general, but because we believe it is most appropriate for our current task as most initiatives are tailored to a research paradigm fitting this cycle (Latour & Woolgar, 1979) . We acknowledge that some disciplines may not be fully covered by this paradigm. In fact, we will address this as one of the major shortcomings of previous research on RRP. Nevertheless, we believe that the empirical cycle is a useful framework to create and present an inventory of current initiatives that aim to foster RRP.",

This position paper aims to identify any gaps for developing new policies. Research performing organizations (incl. universities) strongly determine which policies and governance structures are shaping the research environment individual researchers work in. This responsibility is oftentimes overlooked. This research environment is influencing the behavior of researchers (Haven et al., 2021) and is even perceived as an important issue that may trigger research misconduct (Davies, 2019) . We would like to emphasize the crucial role and responsibility research performing organizations have to foster research integrity. The European SOPs4RI project has already started collecting tools to help institutions foster RRP (Mejlgaard et al., 2020) . Aside from formal policies, actual research practices form the most effective initiatives to foster responsible research. While stakeholders agree that mere changes in policies, guidelines, and codes of conduct will not suffice to establish more responsible research, much attention has been given to these formal academic structures. Nonetheless, actual research practices, as well as informal rules, academic cultures, and interpersonal relations have been the target of recent initiatives and studies on RRP.",

These \"perverse incentives\" (Bouter, 2015) are exacerbated by the high publication pressure and strong competition over research funding and job opportunities that researchers experience (Martinson et al., 2009; Tijdink et al., 2014; van Dalen & Henkens, 2012) .

Figure 2 shows the many types of initiatives at this level, including how they link to the different steps in the empirical cycle and how they relate to each other. In many fields and types of research, the empirical cycle often roughly follows the same steps. From a theory (step 1), a hypothesis is formulated (step 2). To test this hypothesis, a study is designed (step 3) and data are collected (step 4). Based on the analysis of the data, a conclusion is drawn (step 5) and the research is disseminated (step 6). Finally, during and after dissemination, the published literature can be corrected (step 7). These steps are loosely based on the empirical cycle as discussed by De Groot (1961) . We realize that not every single scientific study will fit this representation (e.g., exploratory research where the data generates the hypothesis or conceptual research fields that do not employ data). However, most of the initiatives to promote RRP at the empirical level seem to fit within this framework. The fact that most initiatives fit this framework is also indicative of a potential lack of diversity in those initiatives, arguably not covering research methods and traditions working from different frameworks. In the paragraphs below, we briefly outline the initiatives to promote RRP at each of these steps in the empirical cycle.

At this step, one of the most notable types of initiatives to increase RRP is preregistration (Kupferschmidt, 2018) . There are different ways to preregister a study, but generally, researchers publish their hypotheses and research plan online, before conducting the study. Preregistration can have several goals. First, it allows for a clear distinction between confirmatory and exploratory analyses (Wagenmakers et al., 2012) . Second, it could prevent exploiting flexibility in methods and data analyses to obtain the desired result, because the plans were registered beforehand (initiatives such as Compare [www.comparetrials.org] and EU Trials Tracker [eu.trialstracker.net] compare registrations with the accompanying published papers). Third, preregistration could decrease the effects of publication bias. The practice of preregistration has been standard in biomedicine for years, but has only recently gained popularity in the social sciences. One relatively new form of preregistration is a \"Registered Report\" (Chambers et al., 2015) . Here, the preregistration is submitted to a journal and peer reviewed. Once the preregistration is approved, the authors can get an \"in principle acceptance,\" meaning that if they follow their preregistration, their paper will be published regardless of the outcome. Over 260 journals now accept this format.",

This strategy increases statistical power and allows investigating the generalizability of the findings. It also requires detailed study protocols, which increase reliability. A second initiative to improve RRP at the design step is a stronger focus on replication studies. Replications affect the design phase, but they also link to many other steps in the empirical cycle; from theory to analysis. An example of a Dutch initiative to promote replication studies is the replication grant of NWO (Replication Studies, 2019). A special case of a replication study is a \"registered replication report\": a multilab collaboration that performs a preregistered replication study. Another example of fostering responsible collaboration is the Montreal statement on research integrity in cross-boundary research collaborations (Lancet, 2013) .

Most of these innovations focus on increasing the reliability and robustness of statistical conclusions. Other initiatives focus on increasing the reproducibility of workflows. A study is reproducible 2 if a reanalysis of the data, following the reported procedures, leads to the same results. Reproducibility requires that data should be available and that procedures should be clear. Reproducibility can be greatly improved if researchers manage their data according to the FAIR data principles.

The current evaluation criteria are thought to create a perverse incentive structure, are unidimensionally focused on the \"bean counting\" of publications in high-impact and branded journals, and may nudge researchers unconsciously into QRP with a focus on publishing as many articles as possible, instead of getting it right. How these incentive structures actually influence research practices is still unknown and how the research evaluation criteria should be reformed needs further research. The urgency for this research was also voiced during the 6th World Conference on Research Integrity (WCRI2019) in Hong Kong in June 2019. Research on this theme may also shed light on the obstacles to address. Finding out the reason for the lack of uptake could help form better policies and incentives. Furthermore, we recommend formal consideration by funders of ways to offset risks to early-career researchers in engaging in open research practices and ensuring proper reward and incentive structures are in place (e.g., grants and fellowship schemes that take into account commitment to open practices).",

The open science movement is quickly adopting various initiatives that help to create a more open and transparent science (sharing data, preregistering studies, and openness in peer review and in publishing). While researchers may agree that open science can benefit RRP, there is much misunderstanding on what \"open science\" actually means. More research is thus needed to address the possible benefits and disadvantages of this trend in the research community. We are also still unable to determine if preregistration and the sharing of data are reliable determinants that reduce publication and outcome reporting bias. A shift to open science will furthermore require a coherent operationalization of the many open practices across the empirical cycle so that researchers can work effectively and efficiently in an open manner. The relationship between open science and innovation, especially in collaborations between academic institutions and industry where openness can hamper innovation, is lastly understudied and needs further scrutiny. A shift to open science and increased transparency should also involve reducing the bias of solely publishing positive research: negative and null results are just as important for advancing science.",

Mentors and supervisors play a key role in establishing a responsible research climate for early-career researchers. As such, they have an enormous influence on the next generation of researchers and thus on the (future) practice of responsible research. Furthermore, most of the education in crucial phases of an academic career happens through socialization processes, largely influenced by mentors, supervisors, and role models. However, this pivotal role is not always fully acknowledged and it is seldom thoroughly reviewed in academic research settings. The role of bad supervision or even harassment can furthermore have detrimental effects on research and researchers.

What role can transparency play? Do we know enough about peer review to propose novel strategies and interventions that can make peer review more reliable? Can responsible peer review reduce publication bias? What can automated software do to alleviate the enormous pressure on the peer review system?

Relating to researchers with diverse foci in their solution approach to breaches of research integrity, for example, those focusing on methodological fixes to enhance reproducibility and replicability, and others focusing on open science initiatives (Murphy et al., 2020) , our research agenda emphasizes that those approaches should be harmonized and should move away from the one-size-fits-all solutions. To move away from one-size-fits all approaches to solving these issues, we need to better understand which QRP are prevalent in the different academic disciplines and which RRP are most effective in these disciplines.

In fact, by making research more open and transparent, open science is expected to be an enabler for research integrity and societal impact(Moher et al., 2020).Thepractice of an open science has existed for centuries in Europe in the form of open letters and select publications in scholarly outlets. A modern interpretation of open science has been proposed by the European Commission (2016) as the opening up of research workflows and outcomes via digital technology. This approach applies to the entire research process: designs and methodologies (open methodologies); data that is findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (www.go-fair.org) and open (open data); software code (open source); initial versions of publications and peer review (open peer review); and access to final versions of publications (open access). This approach also includes opening up study materials (open education) and involving citizens in research (citizen science). The European Union has taken a leading role in open science with Plan S (www.coalition-s.org).",
