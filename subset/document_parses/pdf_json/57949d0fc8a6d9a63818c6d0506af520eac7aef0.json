Thus, serological testing, especially to detect NAbs, is essential in determining the onset of the serological immune response, evaluating the potential capacity of the host body for viral clearance, and identifying donors for passive antibody therapy trials. In COVID-19 patients, NAbs can be detected within 2 weeks of symptom onset. 10, 11 The serological antibody response continues for at least 3 weeks and, in some cases, substantially longer. 12, 13 However, the dynamics and roles of SARS-CoV-2-specific NAbs and their correlation with antibody responses have not been explored in COVID-19 patients more than two months after symptom onset.",

Our data suggest that NAb titers in patients were variable, and the protective humoral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may abate over time, which is in accordance with findings in patients infected with other human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E. 21 Recently, in a rhesus macaques model, SARS-CoV-2 infection evoked a robust protective immune response when the animals were re-exposed to SARS-CoV-2 one month after the initial viral infection. 25 However, natural infection and volunteer challenge studies hint that coronavirus infections, including those with HCoV-229E and HCoV-OE43, cannot induce stable protective immunity; thus, reinfection occurs frequently. Moreover, a SARS-CoV A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 14 antigen-specific memory B cell response was not detectable in recovered SARS patients at 6-years after disease onset, whereas SARS-CoV-specific memory T cells persisted in recovered SARS patients. 26, 27 Although the role of memory T cells in the protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2 needs further evaluation, a robust T cell response is required for viral clearance.",

Monitoring NAb levels and their duration will provide valuable data for evaluating the effectiveness of CP therapy. In our study, the levels of NAbs declined gradually over the 3-month follow-up period, with a median decrease of 34.8%. Thus, CP samples with high titers of NAbs from patients in the early stage of convalescence will be more suitable for clinical use. There are some limitations to this study, which should be addressed. Due to the small sample size, we could not find any correlation between the dynamics of NAb titers and clinical characteristics contributing to different clinical outcomes. Serological blood samples were collected up to 3 months after symptom onset; data collected over longer follow-up times should be obtained to demonstrate the duration of humoral immunity after SARS-CoV-2 infection. The lack of data to determine an anamnestic immune response, such as tests for SARS-CoV-2-specific memory B cells, memory T cells, and specific cytokine-dependent memory cells, hampered the evaluation of the immune response, especially protective immunity against viral reinfection.
