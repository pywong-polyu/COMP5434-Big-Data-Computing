Viral and bacterial pathogens subvert retrograde trafficking machinery to facilitate infectivity. Here, we develop a proteomic screen to identify novel retrograde cargo proteins of the Endosomal SNX-BAR Sorting Complex Promoting Exit-1 (ESCPE-1). Using this methodology, we identify Neuropilin-1 (NRP1), a recently characterised host factor for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, as a cargo directly bound and trafficked by ESCPE-1. ESCPE-1 mediates retrograde trafficking of engineered nanoparticles functionalised with the NRP1-interacting peptide of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein. ESCPE-1 sorting of NRP1 may therefore play a role in the intracellular membrane trafficking of",

Despite technical advances into the study of this process 9-13 , the broad array of cargoes that traverse this pathway and the mechanistic basis of their sorting largely remains elusive due to the lack of tools for the unbiased interrogation of the dynamic TGN proteome. To overcome this, we engineered a peroxidase-based proximity biotinylation methodology by fusing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) to the luminal terminus of TGN46, a representative single-pass type I transmembrane protein that predominantly localises to the TGN 14 .",

It is presently unknown whether the SARS-CoV-2 virions that are internalised through endocytosis can hijack NRP1-and ESCPE-1-dependent endocytic trafficking to subvert innate cellular defenses, or whether the Spike protein alone undergoes this trafficking step. We demonstrate that ESCPE-1 coimmunoprecipitates the SARS-CoV-2 Spike through a sequence-dependent mechanism likely dependent on NRP1. Furthermore, engineered nanoparticles displaying the CendR motif of SARS-CoV-2 Spike hijacked ESCPE-1-dependent retrograde trafficking. ESCPE-1 couples to the dynein-dynactin complex to provide a mechanical pulling force that aids the biogenesis of tubular endosomal carriers that traffic towards the perinuclear region 25-27 .
