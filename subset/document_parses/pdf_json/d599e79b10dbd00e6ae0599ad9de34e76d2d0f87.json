            "text": "Mathematical models are powerful tools to investigate, simulate, and evaluate potential interventions for infectious diseases dynamics. Much effort has focused on the Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR)-type compartment models. These models consider host populations and measure change of each compartment. In this study, we propose an alternative patch dynamic modeling framework from pathogens' perspective. Each patch, the basic module of this modeling framework, has four standard mechanisms of pathogen population size change: birth (replication), death, inflow, and outflow. This framework naturally distinguishes between-host transmission process (inflow and outflow) and within-host infection process (replication) during the entire transmission-infection cycle. We demonstrate that the SIR-type model is actually a special cross-sectional and discretized case of our patch dynamics model in pathogens' viewpoint. In addition, this patch dynamics modeling framework is also an agent-based model from hosts' perspective by incorporating individual host's specific traits. We provide an operational standard to formulate this modular-designed patch dynamics model. Model parameterization is feasible with a wide range of sources, including genomics data, surveillance data, electronic health record, and from other emerging technologies such as multiomics. We then provide two proof-of-concept case studies to tackle some of the existing challenges of SIR-type models: sexually transmitted disease and healthcare acquired infections. This patch dynamics modeling framework not only provides theoretical explanations to known phenomena, but also generates novel insights of disease dynamics from a more holistic viewpoint. It is also able to simulate and handle more complicated scenarios across biological scales such as the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Host-oriented population level compartment models for investigating infectious diseases dynamics, such as the commonly used Kermack-McKendrick model (also known as Ross model), were developed around 1920s [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , almost a century ago when diagnosis was largely relying on superficial symptoms of patients (hosts). With the rapid advancement of modern medicine, clinicians now not only know whether the potential patient has certain pathogenic microorganisms (presence-absence) through microbiology tests, but in many scenarios, they can quantify the actual pathogen load (e.g., viral load, number of copies of viral DNA/RNA in viral infections) via modern molecular techniques. While the widely used compartment models have made a tremendous amount of contributions to characterize and understand infectious diseases dynamics [8] [9] [10] , there are quite a few major challenges [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . Pathogen, host, and environment (sometimes linked through one or more vector species) together form an inseparable epidemiology triad, but the compartment models focus only on host populations. Therefore, pathogens, the actual cause of infectious diseases, are only modeled implicitly [16] . Individuals of the host population are usually categorized in discrete epidemiological states, such as susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R), thus the name SIR-type models. For consistency of terminology, we call such host-oriented population level models as SIR-type models throughout this paper. This discretization of epidemiological states was reasonable a century ago when only clinical symptoms and signs rather than confirmatory laboratory data were available. However, such discretization is too coarse compared to the clinical information we can acquire now, e.g., viral load, colony forming units, and genomic sequence of specific pathogen strain. For example, a patient carrying 100 viral load and the other carrying 1000 viral load of a specific virus are both categorized as \"I\" state, nevertheless, the two patients differ substantially on potential disease transmissibility. To address this issue, current SIR-type models may have many more sub-divided compartments.",

Environment is one of three major components of the epidemiological triad [26] , a fundamental concept in infectious disease epidemiology (the other two being pathogen and host).

In an SIR-type model, a single transmission coefficient (usually denoted as \u03b2) quantifies the combined effect of contact rate between susceptible (S) and infected (I) hosts (between-host), and per-contact probability of infection (within-host) [16] . Nevertheless, between-host transmission and within-host infection comprise a series of complicated and interdependent pathological, physiological, and immunological processes [12, 13] . In addition, simple SIR-type mode rely on the implicit assumption of homogeneous mixing. Therefore, we suggest that one single transmission coefficient is over-simplified and does not reflect the reality of the underlying transmission-infection processes.",

These models are also able to track evolution of pathogens and resistance as well [30, 31] , which is not feasible by the commonly used host-level SIR-type model. While these cross-scale models are pioneers in providing a more comprehensive characterizations of infectious disease dynamics, there are still some obstacles. First, most of these models focus on the host aspect and usually do not consider the environmental reservoir as a critical component. Second, there is still a lack of standardization and consistency of cross-scale model formulation, leading to inconsistency and lack of interoperability among these frameworks. Therefore, it is difficult to compare and evaluate different types of models.

Environment, host, and vector are all pathogens' temporary or persistent patch. Therefore, pathogens' population dynamics can be modeled in a standardized way among different patches (human host, vector host, reservoir host, environment). On the other hand, because each host and/or environment is specifically modeled as their respective patch, this modeling framework is also an agent-based model (ABM) from host's perspective. Our modeling framework can be formulated for interoperability using the existing \"Overview, Design concepts, and Details\" (ODD) protocol [36, 37] . In addition, since our modeling framework is standardized across pathogen patches, it avoids the potential pitfall of temporal resolution inconsistency in other commonly used cross-scale models [38] .",

Depending on patch type and specific disease to model, each patch does not necessarily need to have all four mechanisms. For instance, many pathogens can enter the dormant state in harsh environment [39] , therefore there will be no birth or death in that patch during the dormancy period. Patches are interconnected via pathogen inflow and/or outflow. Some patches may only have inflow (known as \"sink\") or outflow (known as \"source\") in source-sink dynamics [40] .

Nevertheless, this coefficient can be time and/or patch dependent to include realistic interaction between the patch and pathogen subpopulations. This modeling framework is actually an agent-based model (ABM) from the host's perspective [36, 37] . Therefore, we are able to model the effective birth rate of pathogen subpopulation at specific host H i at given time t as a function f of the host's risk factors, e.g., clinical, epidemiological, demographic risk factors such as treatment status, vaccination status, immune system level, age, gender, ethnicity, etc., such that \u03b2 it = f(H it ). Consequently, the immune response between pathogen and host, the key factor that determines the success of pathogen invasion, can be modeled by this framework as well. In addition, this model can also handle host demographics as well. For example, death of the host due to infection can be modeled as removal of the specific host patch, thus eliminating the residing pathogen subpopulation within the host patch.",

For demonstration purposes, consider a patch having two interacting pathogens P i1 and P i2 . From an ecological perspective, microbial interaction, like any ecological interaction, could be competitive (with the extreme case of competitive exclusion, seen in Fleming's discovery of Penicillin), commensal, predatory, and mutually beneficial. The last one, mutualism among pathogens, can be dangerous to hosts (patients). Two or more pathogens which may or may not necessarily invade the same host at the same time can synergistically take down host's immune system for co-infection (e.g., co-infection of HIV and syphilis, HIV and tuberculosis, hookworm and malaria, multiple arboviruses, and different serotypes of the same pathogen [45] [46] [47] ). The system equation for each patch P in this scenario will be modeled as follows (assuming two pathogen species/serotypes 1 and 2 coexist and interact in each patch) in Eqs 5.1 and 5.2:",

As stated earlier, the original Kermack-McKendrick model was developed almost a century ago [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] when diagnosis was largely based upon superficial symptoms. Since then, clinical sciences have been vastly improved. Diagnosis is now based on much more concrete and accurate molecular, biochemical, and biological evidences in addition to symptoms. Living in era of Big Data, we have abundant data available to describe the longitudinal and continuous pathogen dynamics within a single host [34] . Now we know that some pathogens, for example Ebola virus, have a very rapid disease progression after initial exposure to the pathogen. Therefore, in a host-level SIR-type model, the incubation period would be neglected by assuming that susceptible hosts become infected almost immediately after exposure. Consequently, one would model Ebola as an SIR model.",

These results show that in addition to understanding the underlying contact network, we need to have more precise clinical and epidemiological information about these individuals in order to make accurate predictions of disease dynamics. This case study also demonstrates the important and novel concept of U = U (undetectable equals un-transmissible) especially in HIV intervention [59] . Although currently there is no cure for HIV-positive individuals, they can take antiviral treatment (ART) regularly to suppress the viral load below detectable amount (e.g., <200 copies of viral RNA/mL in blood, commonly known as \"suppressed\" status). These hosts are still carriers of HIV virus, but transmission does not typically occur because of extremely small number of pathogens present. This is another example of how current clinical insights are difficult to represent in SIR-type model. Demonstration of U = U is depicted in Fig 4 panel 2 (top right) and large death rates of HIV can be the effect of antiviral treatment.

A human host, a zoonotic host, a piece of homogenous environment, and a vector are all examples of patches, the dwellings for pathogen populations that live in. A patch is the standard module in this modeling framework and patch dynamics of pathogen can be described in a universal way with four pathogen population size change mechanisms: birth, death, inflow, and outflow. The relatively Table. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0238186.g005 simple mathematical expression and universal adaptability enables this modeling framework to be adopted to investigate much more complicated scenarios of transmission dynamics. For example, transmission with non-homogeneous mixing (contact structure), co-infection with multiple interacting pathogens (or serotypes/strains), transmission with multiple transmission pathways, all of which are challenging to SIR-type models [12] [13] [14] [15] , can be formulated by connecting the interacting patches. Therefore, it is our firm belief that in the Big Data era when data-driven machine learning models are making tremendous progress in predicting infectious disease outbreaks [60, 61] , relatively simple and interpretable mechanistic models (e.g., our patch dynamics model or SIR-type models) are still relevant and useful. In fact, with larger amounts of easily accessible data, machine learning methods can be applied to parameterize for the mechanistic model (as shown in Fig 3) and complement each other to characterize infectious disease dynamics more accurately [34] . In addition, current COVID-19 pandemic proposes substantial challenge to the common SIR-type modeling paradigm, especially how unknown proportion and contribution of asymptomatic patients can be adequately and accurately incorporated in the models. We will further develop a pathogen-oriented COVID-19 transmission model based on the modeling framework in this study. Symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are two types of patches differing in host susceptibility and infectivity. More clinical and epidemiological inputs can also be included in our novel modeling approach (Fig  3) . We believe our modeling framework can handle more complicated epidemic systems such as current COVID-19 pandemic [62] .",

The cost and accuracy of next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled highly granular characterization of different strains of pathogens [28, 29] . Therefore, strainspecific interactions within the same patch, for instance, co-infection and inter-specific competition of more than one strain in the same host (e.g., superinfection of different strains of dengue virus [63] ). Because this modeling framework builds on solid ecological foundations, even more complicated scenarios, such as cross-scale modeling of more than one host or vector, can be investigated. One example will be the hierarchical food web interactions that occur to pathogenic Escherichia coli in the environment. Nematodes in the soil prey on or carry E. coli, various fly species mechanically carry nematodes and further spread the nematodes containing E.coli to hosts such as farm animals or humans. All these complicated interactions and their associated process parameters could be identified and quantified with the help of NGS. Therefore, our modeling framework will provide a more comprehensive and accurate depiction of pathogen transmission in the ecosystem.",

Scaling up, our modeling framework can handle pathogen flow among villages/ communities in various suburban or urban setting, as seen in metapopulation models [64] [65] [66] [67] .

Genomics data from hosts, vectors, and pathogens, behavior information of hosts, information in electronic health records that provides a continuous viewpoint of individual's health, all contributes to more accurate parameterization of this model. We suggest that right now, this modeling framework would work the best with a small, semi-closed, and closely monitored human host population. Nevertheless, with newer, more available and more accurate data sources, this modeling framework should also be able to handle disease transmission in relatively large host population. As discussed earlier, this scalable framework enables it to operate at larger scale (which generally encompasses larger host population) to indirectly handle larger host population [43, 44, 62] .",
