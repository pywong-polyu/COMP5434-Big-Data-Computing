Here, we suggest that the cell-free supernatant from Lactobacillus plantarum NIBR97, including novel bacteriocins, has potential as a natural alternative to chemical disinfectants. It exhibits significant antibacterial activities against a broad range of pathogens, and was observed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to cause cellular lysis through pore formation in bacterial membranes, implying that its antibacterial activity may be mediated by peptides or proteins and supported by proteinase K treatment. It also showed significant antiviral activities against HIV-based lentivirus and influenza A/H3N2, causing lentiviral lysis through envelope collapse. Furthermore, whole-genome sequencing revealed that NIBR97 has diverse antimicrobial peptides, and among them are five novel bacteriocins, designated as plantaricin 1 to 5. Plantaricin 3 and 5 in particular showed both antibacterial and antiviral activities. SEM revealed that plantaricin 3 causes direct damage to both bacterial membranes and viral envelopes, while plantaricin 5 damaged only bacterial membranes, implying different antiviral mechanisms. Our data suggest that the cell-free supernatant from L. plantarum NIBR97, including novel bacteriocins, is potentially useful as a natural alternative to chemical disinfectants.",

The cell-free supernatant also showed MIC50s and MIC90s against Salmonella Gallinarum, Edwardsiella tarda, Pasteurella multocida, and Streptococcus iniae ( Figures 1B and S1B ), implying antibacterial activity against broad pathogenic bacteria. In addition, when Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were treated with the cell-free supernatant for 5 min, they showed a reduction of at least 99.9% (\u22653 log 10 ) of the total count in the original inoculum ( Figure 1C ), indicating bactericidal activity and potential as a disinfectant.",

Antibacterial activities of the cell-free supernatant from the L. plantarum strains NIBR97, KCTC33131, KCTC21004, and KCTC13093 were examined against Salmonella Enteritidis, whose MIC50s and MIC90s were determined (A). The MIC50s and MIC90s of the cell-free supernatant were determined against Salmonella Gallinarum (SG), Edwardsiella tarda (ET), Pasteurella multocida (PM), and Streptococcus iniae (SI), as well as S. Enteritidis (SE) (B). For bactericidal activity, Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus were treated with the cell-free supernatant (126.6 \u03bcg total proteins/mL) for 5 min, and then were counted to determine the titer (Log10 (colony-forming unit (CFU)/mL) and reduction rate (%) (C). For scanning electron microscopy, S. Enteritidis was treated without (control) or with the cell-free supernatant (70.8 \u03bcg total proteins/mL, MIC against S. Enteritidis) for 1 h and 8 h (D). The red arrows indicate the pores forming in the Salmonella membrane. (E) To investigate the effect of protease on the antibacterial activity of the cell-free supernatant, we added the proteinase K (100 \u00b5 g/mL) to the cell-free supernatant at 70.8 \u03bcg total proteins/mL and the treated sample was used to examine its antibacterial activity against S.

As shown in Figure 1D , the SEM images revealed that the cell-free supernatant effectively caused the Salmonella death via pore formation by cellular penetrating peptides, Pharmaceuticals 2020, 13, 0266 4 of 13 as is the case for typical AMPs [13] . Furthermore, when the cell-free supernatant was treated with proteinase K, its antibacterial activity against S. Enteritidis decreased by about 50% compared with the control without the proteinase K treatment ( Figure 1E ). Therefore, we suggest that proteins or peptides play major roles for the antibacterial activities of cell-free supernatant from L. plantarum NIBR97.",

The NIBR97 genome identified from de novo assembly was composed of a single circular bacterial chromosome and four plasmids, containing 2927 predicted open reading frames (ORFs), 68 tRNAs, and 16 rRNAs ( Table 2 and Figure S2 ). Among the ORFs, 10 were identified to encode homologous proteins with known AMPs via an NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information) homology BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) (Table S1 ). Furthermore, their expression in L. plantarum NIBR97 was confirmed by the transcriptomic data (Table S2 ). In detail, the five ORFs-orf02155, orf02163, orf02164, orf02421, and orf00645-were found to have 100% identities with plantaricin N, F, and E, as well as bacteriophage holing and lysozyme, known previously as AMPs from the Lactobacillus genus (Table S1 ). Five ORFs-orf00467, orf01336, orf01363, orf01599, and orf01790-which were previously uncharacterized until now, were discovered in this study to consist of amino acid sequences with high positives (>60%) with AMPs undiscovered in L. plantarum strains: grammistin Pp3, indolicidin, bactofencin A, hymenochirin-5B, and latarcin-2a, (Table S1 ). Thus, we herein designated the AMPs as novel bacteriocins called plantaricin (Pln) 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 (Table S1 ). Interestingly, their structural models revealed that the three plantaricins-Pln 1, 4 and 5-form helix structures, and the two plantaricins-Pln 2 and 3-form random coil structures (Figure 3 ), similar to typical AMPs [14, 15] , implying that they may have antibacterial activities.",

This suggests that Pln 3 and 5 can considerably suppress viral infection in host cells. Interestingly, SEM revealed that Pln 3 effectively caused lentiviral lysis through the collapse of the envelopes (Figure 6 ), as the cell-free supernatant did ( Figure 2B ), whereas Pln 5 did not ( Figure 6 ). This implies that Pln 3 and 5 may exert their antiviral role through different mechanisms. ",

Our scanning electron micrographs of S. Enteritidis showed clearly that the cell-free supernatant from the NIBR97 formed a pore on the Salmonella surface ( Figure 1D ), as do typical AMPs [13] . Proteinase K treatment of the cell-free supernatant led to a considerable decrease in its antibacterial activity against both S. Enteritidis and S. Gallinarum ( Figure 1E ). Thus, these results confirm that the antibacterial activities of the cell-free supernatant from the NIBR97 are mediated mainly by its proteins or peptides, functioning as AMPs. The scanning electron micrographs of GFP-labeled lentivirus showed that the cell-free supernatant causes lentiviral lysis through envelope collapse (Figure 2A ), but it was unclear whether the AMPs were involved in the envelope collapse of the virus.",

            "text": "Finally, to identify AMPs from the NIBR97 strains, we performed whole-genome sequencing, which revealed that the 10 ORFs encoded AMPs, including known forms (plantaricin E, F, N; bacteriophage holin; lysozyme) and novel forms (Pln 1 to 5 (Table S1) ). In the case of the known AMPs, plantaricin E, F, and N are bacteriocins produced in Lactobacillus plantarum C11 [20] ; holin, produced by bacteriophages, triggers and controls the degradation of the cell wall of the host bacteria [21] ; and lysozyme functions as 1,4-beta-N-acetylmuramidase, an antimicrobial enzyme, and has been found mainly in Lactobacillus rhamnosus strains [22] . Interestingly, five ORFs were discovered as novel bacteriocins in this study ( Figure 3 ) and were designated as Pln 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. They were further confirmed as being expressed in the NIBR97 strain through transcriptomic sequencing (Table S2) , and even their synthetic peptides exhibited antibacterial activity against Salmonella Typhimurium ( Figure S3 ). The synthetic Pln 3 and 5 also inhibited the growth of S. Enteritidis and effectively caused cellular lysis through damage to the Salmonella membrane via pore formation (Figure 4) , suggesting that they function as AMPs. However, the synthetic Plns showed overall lower antibacterial activities than antibiotics such as octenidine when their MICs were compared with each other ( Figure S3 ) [23] . This is presumably because the Plns were not synthesized on the basis of complete amino acid sequences for the optimal antibacterial activity but were done on the basis of minimal sequences for the activity; thus, it is further necessary to identify the mature peptide sequence responsible for the optimal antibacterial activity, following the signal peptide cleavage. Moreover, Pln 3 and 5 were identified to suppress lentiviral infection in human host cells ( Figure 5 ). Collectively, these results suggest that the cell-free supernatant from L. plantarum NIBR97 may include AMPs, such as Pln 3 and 5, exhibiting antibacterial and antiviral activities. However, Pln 3 and 5 were observed by SEM to act differentially in the suppression of viral infection; Pln 3 had a significant effect on the viral shape through the collapse of the viral envelope, which suggests that it may cause direct damage to the envelope. In contrast, Pln 5 had little effect on it (Figure 6 ), which implies that it may interfere with the interaction between viruses and host cells [24, 25] .",

            "text": "Noticeably, Pln 3 and 5 suppressed viral infection when used against lentivirus for 24 h, but not for 5 min (Figure 5 ), which indicates that long exposure is required for their antiviral role. Although the Plns exhibited low antibacterial activities as mentioned above, during long expose (i.e., 24 h), they may also contribute significantly to the antibacterial activities of cell-free supernatant, together with other AMPs discovered by genomic analysis of NIBR97, which is strongly supported by the proteinase K treatment leading to a considerable decrease (>50%) in antibacterial activity of the cell-free supernatant ( Figure 1E ). Furthermore, this is confirmed by Figure S4 -the cell-free supernatant from the E. coli Top10 strain (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), harboring each Pln gene cloned, showed significant antibacterial activities against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria, whereas very little antibacterial activity was detected in the negative control, that is, treatment with the cell-free supernatant from the strain without the Pln genes ( Figure S4) . Meanwhile, the disinfection activity of the cell-free supernatant during short exposures (i.e., within 30 min), as shown in Figure 1C and Table 1 , was presumably because the lactic acid may have functioned as a disinfectant during the short exposure. This is supported by the data, showing that the cell-free supernatant contained considerable lactic acids (\u22482%) when the NIBR97 strain was cultured in the de Man, Rogosa and Sharpe (MRS) medium, consisting of 5% solutes and 95% water, for 24 h (Figure S5 ), and by a previous report stating that they induce sudden severe acid stress, leading to a shock of oxidative stress and resulting in the destabilization of Pharmaceuticals 2020, 13, 0266 9 of 13 the bacterial membrane [26] . Therefore, the cell-free supernatant may exert its role as a disinfectant, mainly through lactic acid during short exposure (i.e., within 30 min), while it does so through an integrated effect between the lactic acid and the various AMPs during long exposure (i.e., 24 h).",

In detail, genomic DNA from the NIBR97 was extracted and sequenced by previously described procedures [28] . De novo assembly and putative gene coding sequences (CDSs) from the assembled contigs was performed by the hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP, Version 3) workflow [30] and the bacterial genome was checked by MUMmer 3.5 [31] , identifying that the genome comprises a single circular DNA chromosome of 3,022,780 bp with four plasmids by trimming one of the self-similar ends for manual genome closure (Table 2) . Putative gene coding sequences (CDSs) from the assembled contigs were identified by Glimmer v3.02 [32] , and the obtained ORFs were examined by Blastall alignment (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1762). Gene ontology annotations of the ORFs were assigned by Blast2GO software [33] . In addition, ribosomal RNAs and transfer RNAs were separated by RNAmmer 1.2 and tRNAscan-SE 1.4 [34, 35] . Finally, the whole-genome sequence data were deposited as Sequence Read Archive (SRA) data in GenBank (SRA no., SRR12344691; BioProject no., PRJNA647132).",
