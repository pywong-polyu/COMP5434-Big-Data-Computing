While recent treatment advancements have extended overall survival (OS), refractory MM has a poor prognosis, with a median OS of between 4 and 6 months. Nuclear export inhibition, specifically inhibition of CRM1/ XPO1, is an emerging novel treatment modality that has shown promise in treatment-refractory MM. Initially discovered in yeast in 1983, early clinical applications were met with significant toxicities that limited their utility. The creation of small molecule inhibitors of nuclear export (SINE) has improved on toxicity limitations and has led to investigation in a number of malignancies at the preclinical and clinical stages. Preclinical studies of SINEs in MM have shown that these molecules are cytotoxic to myeloma cells, play a role in therapy resensitization, and suggest a role in limiting bone disease progression. In July 2019, selinexor became the first nuclear export inhibitor approved for use in relapsed/refractory MM based on the STORM trial. As of May 2020, there were eight ongoing trials combining selinexor with standard treatment regimens in relapsed/refractory MM. Eltanexor, a second-generation SINE, is also under investigation and has shown preliminary signs of efficacy in an early clinical trial while potentially having an improved toxicity profile compared with selinexor. Results in ongoing trials will help further define the role of SINEs in MM.",

            "text": "Targeting nuclear export for anticancer therapy is an emerging field that has shown promise in MM. Regulation of the cell cycle is in part mediated by proteins facilitating the transport of molecules across the nuclear envelope. Chromosomal maintenance 1 (CRM1), also known as exportin 1 (XPO1), is a protein that interacts with a nuclear export signal and mediates the export of proteins and RNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm [4] . Aberrant regulation of this nuclear-cytoplasmic transport has been implicated in the development of cancer. Overexpression of XPO1 results in the mislocation of tumor suppressor proteins such as p53, APC/\u03b2-catenin, FOXO3, BRCA 1/2, IkBa, survivin, and others. In some cancers, DNA topoisomerases I and IIa are shuttled into the cytoplasm via XPO1. This ultimately prevents anthracycline-and etoposide-induced cell death, which requires the topoisomerases to remain intranuclear. Oncogenes such as BCR-ABL, and oncoproteins such as cmyc, are also shuttled via XPO1, which acts to increase their oncogenic potential [5, 6] . In addition, high XPO1 expression has been observed to be a poor prognostic indicator in some cancers such as acute myeloid lymphoma (AML) and gastric cancer [7, 8] . A number of nuclear export inhibitors are now under investigation in a range of malignancies (Table 1) .",

Gene expression analyses have shown increased XPO1 expression in MM cells compared with plasma cells from healthy subjects and those with monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) and smoldering MM (SMM) [10] . Similarly, expression is higher in human myeloma cell lines than primary samples from MM patients. Increased XPO1 expression is associated with increased lytic lesions, as well as shorter progression-free survival (PFS) and OS [11] . XPO1 expression also plays a role in drug resistance, with XPO1 having a fourfold increased expression in bortezomib-resistant MM cell lines [12] . Of note, corticosteroids have well known anti-myeloma activity, and transport of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) is also mediated by XPO1. Research into XPO1 inhibition has led to the development of selinexor, the first US FDA-approved inhibitor of nuclear export that is now approved in penta-refractory MM (i.e. patients refractory to at least two immunomodulatory agents, two proteasome inhibitors, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody) (Fig. 1) [13] .",

            "text": "The first discovered inhibitor of nuclear export via XPO1 inhibition was leptomycin B (LMB). Originally isolated from Streptomyces sp. ATS1287, LMB was discovered during a program searching for new antifungal antibiotics in 1983 [14] . The relation of LMB to XPO1 was first established in 1993 by Nishi et al. during their study of LMB resistant Schizosaccharomyces pombe [15] . They showed that mutations in XPO1 caused LMB resistance, and amplification of wild-type XPO1 conferred LMB resistance in wildtype S. pombe. In 1999, Kudo et al. discovered that LMB covalently binds and alkylates a cysteine residue on XPO1, leading to XPO1 inactivation via blocking of the nuclear export sequence of cargo proteins [16] . LMB was found to have significant activity against a variety of experimental leukemia, melanoma, sarcoma, and other tumor models [17] . In 1996, a phase I clinical trial of LMB (termed Elastocin) was initiated at the Charing Cross Hospital in London [18] . A total of 33 patients with diagnoses including colon, ovary, melanoma, glioma, sarcoma, pancreas, and other cancers were enrolled. Significant toxicities were observed, including nausea, vomiting, severe anorexia, and malaise, with ultimately no partial response seen in these patients. Ratjadone C, isolated from myxobacterium Sorangium cellulosum, is another XPO1 inhibitor of similar structure and molecular mechanism to LMB that has been tested in vitro only [4] . In 2003, Burzlaff et al. found ratjadone inhibited growth against the tumor lines Jurkat, HepG2, and U87-MG [19] . Using MM cell lines, Turner et al. demonstrated that Ratjadone C was able to sensitize these cells ",

While numerous mechanisms of action have been proposed, Mingshan et al. demonstrated that curcumin targets XPO1 and inhibits nuclear export [22] . Unlike other nuclear export inhibitors, curcumin also inhibits the nuclear export of p53 by blocking the phosphorylation of p53 by Jun activation-domain binding protein (Jab1) [23] . Curcumin has been tested against numerous human myeloma cell lines with success [24] . Cells lines with poor prognostic indicators t(4;14) and t(14;16) were found to be sensitive to curcumin, with sensitivity being independent of TP53 status. Primary myeloma cells, including those with del(17p), were also found to be sensitive to curcumin. In patients with MGUS and SMM, investigators have found curcumin therapy resulted in decreased bone turnover and paraprotein load, suggesting curcumin may slow disease progression [25] . In 2020, Ramakrishna et al. used curcumin in place of dexamethasone in 15 MM patients age > 55 years who were no longer tolerating dexamethasone [26] . Curcumin C3 complex, at 3-4 g daily, was administered alongside either an IMiD or PI, resulting in a reduction in paraprotein load by 38% and plasmacytosis by 59%. The major adverse effect was diarrhea, which improved with cessation or by decreasing the dose of curcumin. In an effort to improve on the poor oral bioavailability of curcumin, intravenous formulations of curcumin have been developed. In 2019, SignPath Pharma demonstrated that their formulation of liposomal curcumin (LipoCurc) had intense uptake in MM cell lines compared with red blood cells and mononuclear cells, with minimal metabolism to tetrahydrocurcumin (THC), the main inactive metabolite [27] . The maximum tolerated dose has been established and phase I/II trials in MM are currently under development [28] . Ultimately, more studies are needed to further characterize the mechanism of action of curcumin, specifically as it relates to MM, its clinical efficacy, and how it may fit in the myeloma treatment paradigm.",

            "text": "The use of selinexor in preclinical studies of MM has demonstrated its ability to work synergistically with chemotherapeutic agents and dexamethasone. In 2013, Turner et al. demonstrated that SINEs, including selinexor, induced apoptosis both as a single agent or in a synergistic manner when combined with doxorubicin, bortezomib, or carfilzomib in myeloma cell populations [34] . This effect was observed to be dose-dependent and spared normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Co-incubation with doxorubicin was observed to induce activated caspase 3 in myeloma, but not non-myeloma, cell populations. These findings suggested that SINEs may be selective specifically for myeloma cells, unlike LMB in prior studies. The sensitization of myeloma cells to doxorubicin, bortezomib, and carfilzomib in the presence of selinexor was further supported in later studies [35] [36] [37] [38] . In 2014, Tai et al demonstrated that not only do SINEs induce apoptosis but they also block receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-\u0392 ligand (RANKL)-induced nuclear factor (NF)-kB and NFATc1, key osteoclast differentiation regulators [39] . The blockage of NFATc1 and downstream differentiation genes prevented adhesion and formation of functional osteoclasts, indicating that SINEs also have the added benefit of reducing the progression of bone disease. In 2018, Argueta et al. demonstrated that selinexor has synergistic effects with dexamethasone in a GR-dependent manner [40] . Selinexor enhances the transcription and translation of the GR while dexamethasone activates GR, which ultimately leads to antitumor activity and cell death. It was suggested that selinexor can be used to resensitize patients to dexamethasone or be beneficial in patients who lack GR activity. Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a molecule that contributes to the progression of myeloma, was inhibited with this combination, in part through enhancing the expression of the negative regular REDD1. In a xenograft model of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice, the authors found that selinexor-dexamethasonetreated mice had significantly reduced tumor growth compared with mice treated with selinexor or dexamethasone alone. A number of clinical trials are currently underway for the use of selinexor in multiple malignancies.",

All patients received ondansetron 8 mg before the first dose, with other supportive measures administered as needed. The median time to response was 4.1 weeks, including two patients who had progressed after prior chimeric antigen receptor T-cell therapy (CAR-T). Overall response, defined as partial response or better, was 26% (n = 32); 13% achieved minimal response, 39% had stable disease, and 21% had progressive disease. Median PFS was 3.7 months and OS was 8.6 months. Of the patients enrolled, 96% discontinued treatment, usually due to adverse events (19.5%) or disease progression (55.1%). The most common adverse events were thrombocytopenia (73%), fatigue (73%), and nausea (72%). Common grade 3/4 adverse events included thrombocytopenia (59%), anemia (44%), and hyponatremia (22%) ( Table 2 ). In the center with the highest enrollment (n = 28), despite comparable baseline characteristics and overall rates of AEs, the ORR, PFS, and OS were 53.6%, 5.3 months, and 15.6 months, respectively, likely due to only two patients coming off for toxicity (manuscript in preparation). At this center, an aggressive, multiagent, antinausea prophylaxis (ondansetron, NK1 receptor antagonist, and olanzapine), close symptom and laboratory monitoring during cycle 1 with supportive care, and dose holds/modification were used. Therefore, in a population with rapidly progressive disease, higher doses of selinexor are needed initially to attain disease control (lower doses were not as efficacious in the phase I dose-escalation study) with aggressive supportive care, and, thereafter, the selinexor dose typically ends up being lowered to a maintenance dose. Of note, putting aside the selinexor-associated increase in GR activity, it is especially important to be aware that the antiemetic aprepitant, an NK1 receptor antagonist (NK1RA), is a moderate inhibitor of cytochrome P450 isoenzyme 3A4. As a result, there is a 2.2-fold increase in the area under the concentration-time curve of dexamethasone, therefore either the dose of dexamethasone must be reduced by 50% or, alternatively, the NK1RA rolapitant, which does not have this interaction, can be used [42] .",

In 402 patients with relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM) who previously received between one and three prior treatment regimens (NCT03110562), in spite of 40% lower bortezomib and 25% lower dexamethasone doses at 24 weeks (eight cycles), the study met its primary endpoint, with a median PFS of 13.93 months and 9.46 months (hazard ratio 0.70; p = 0.0066) for SVd and Vd, respectively. Interestingly, approximately 50% of patients in both arms were high risk [central fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) testing and del (17p) or t(14;16) or t(4;14) or amp 1q21] and the PFS hazard ratio for high risk (0.67 [0.45-0.98]) was comparable with the standard risk 0.62 (0.42-0.95). For the 37 patients with del 17p, the hazard ratio was even lower at 0.38 (0.16-0.86). No imbalance in deaths between the two groups was reported and the median OS was not reached in both arms, although OS will be difficult to interpret as crossover was permitted in this study for those patients progressing on Vd to receive SVd; however, more patients came off for either adverse events or patient withdrawal (36% and 20% in SVd and Vd, respectively) [45] . There were higher rates of cytopenia, gastrointestinal issues, weight decrease, fatigue, and cataract in the SVd arm, whereas neuropathy rates were higher in the Vd arm. The increased frequency of cataracts in the SVd arm also raises the possibility of increased corticosteroid activity (despite a lower dose of dexamethasone in the SVd arm). While cross-study comparisons are fraught with issues, especially here where the STORM trial included a much more heavily treated population treated with selinexor 80 mg twice weekly, whereas the BOSTON trial included a less heavily treated population treated with 100 mg weekly, the AEs are generally lower in the BOSTON trial, especially considering the contribution of bortezomib in the BOSTON trial.",

            "text": "Eltanexor, also known as KPT8602, is a next-generation XPO1 inhibitor that has shown some promise in reducing toxicity compared with selinexor. Eltanexor binds to XPO1 and inhibits XPO1-cargo interactions in a similar manner to previous generation SINEs. Hing and colleagues demonstrated that eltanexor and selinexor have similar cytotoxicity in CLL, AML, and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) representative cell lines [51] . Eltanexor was better tolerated and was shown to have reduced CNS penetration in mouse, rat, and monkey models. In CLL and patient-derived xenograft AML mouse models, eltanexor was demonstrated to prolong survival. Using numerous MM cell lines, Turney et al. demonstrated that eltanexor led to apoptosis and functioned synergistically in all cell lines when combined with common anti-MM agents such as bortezomib, carfilzomib, doxorubicin, melphalan, and etoposide [52] . Using mouse models, the authors did not observe weight loss toxicity that is typically observed with selinexor. Treated MM cells from newly diagnosed/relapsed patient bone marrow aspirates with eltanexor + typical anti-MM agents revealed that combination treatment was more effective than a single agent in inducing apoptosis. Currently, a phase I/II clinical trial sponsored by Karyopharm Therapeutics, Inc. is underway to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of eltanexor in relapsed/refractory MM (RRMM), metastatic colorectal cancer, metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer, and higher risk myelodysplastic syndrome (NCT02649790). In 2017, preliminary data of the MM arm were released. Inclusion criteria in this group included patients with confirmed symptomatic RRMM that was previously treated and refractory to three or more therapies, including an IMiD, PI, alkylator, and corticosteroid [53] . This arm was designed as a 3 + 3 dose escalation study. Oral eltanexor was administered as 5-60 mg (\u00b1 dexamethasone) either every other day for 3 days per week or daily during a 28-day cycle. A total of 34 evaluable patients were reported, with a median time on treatment of 96 days. The best responses were observed in patients receiving 20 and 30 mg plus dexamethasone, with an ORR of 35%, clinical benefit rate (CBR) of 64%, and progressive disease rate (PR) of 7.1%. This was compared with an ORR of 21%, CBR of 47%, and PR of 18% among all patients. Nausea (54%), fatigue (46%), anemia (38%), diarrhea (38%), weight loss (33%), and neutropenia (31%) were the most common grade 1/2 adverse effects. Grade 3/4 adverse effects included thrombocytopenia (56%), neutropenia (26%), anemia and leukopenia (15%), and hyponatremia (10%). More patients had decreased appetite and weight loss at and above 30 mg. Dose escalation was halted as efficacy was reached, therefore maximum tolerated dose was not determined. Based on the greater efficacy and improved adverse effect profile, the RP2D of eltanexor was established to be 20 mg administered five times per week with 20 mg of dexamethasone administered twice weekly. Overall, these preliminary data have shown eltanexor can be efficacious in MM while potentially having a superior adverse effect profile to selinexor.",

General standards of care have been established in initial therapy, with various combinations of lenalidomide, bortezomib, daratumumab, and dexamethasone used in most initial regimens regardless of transplant eligibility [54] . Ultimately, nearly all patients relapse, with ever-decreasing remission durations with each relapse. The choice of treatment at relapse is determined by all considerations at the initial diagnosis and also the time of relapse and tolerance of and response/refractoriness to prior therapy. Today, combinations of IMiDs, PIs, anti-CD38 antibodies, pan-deacetylase inhibitors (panobinostat) and anti-SLAMF7 antibodies (elotuzumab) are available at relapse. Despite numerous options, patients typically become refractory to all drug classes [55] . The treatment of this multidrug refractory population is an unmet need. Data from approximately 7400 patients treated with 129 drugs in 228 early-phase studies demonstrated that the threshold response rate needed for regulatory approval and widespread clinical use is 20%, however this gets increasingly challenging for a single agent (\u00b1 dexamethasone) to achieve in increasingly drug-refractory patients.",

            "text": "Nuclear export inhibition is a novel therapeutic mechanism in MM, with strong preclinical rationale based on XPO1 overexpression in MM cells and correlation with worse clinical outcomes. Preclinical trials in nuclear export inhibition have shown direct cytotoxicity in myeloma cell lines and suggest possible therapy resensitization. Clinical trials have shown this new drug class to be efficacious when used alone or in combination with dexamethasone or other conventional agents used in MM. In MM patients who experience multiple relapses, selinexor provides a new treatment option in those refractory to at least two immunomodulatory agents, two PIs, and an anti-CD38 monoclonal antibody. In this population, with rapidly progressive disease and rather permissive eligibility criteria (e.g. creatinine clearance of 20 mL/min and an ANC of 1000/uL), the STORM trial demonstrated an ORR of 26%, a median PFS of 3.7 months, and a median OS of 8.6 months. These results distinguish selinexor from panobinostat, elotuzumab, and ixazomib, which required combination regimens in studies for approval, and put it more in the category of carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and daratumumab, which all also received accelerated approval due to activity demonstrated in a single-arm study in a population with no other available treatment options. The STORM study also demonstrated significant grade 3/4 toxicity, primarily in four categories-fatigue, gastrointestinal (particularly nausea/vomiting, decreased appetite, weight loss), hyponatremia, and hematologic toxicities. However, toxicities are also in part due to the patient population. For example, the incidence of thrombocytopenia is highest in patients with triple-class refractory myeloma (58% with grade 3/4 thrombocytopenia), while patients with advanced solid malignancies and previously treated sarcoma had much lower rates (15.9% and 9.3%, respectively) [56, 57] . Fortunately, given the short half-life of selinexor, drug interruption and dose reductions upon disease control are important strategies to reverse toxicities, in addition to proactive supportive care, including combinations of antiemetics. Moreover, similar to carfilzomib, pomalidomide, and daratumuab, the optimal use of novel agents, including selinexor, is not as a doublet derived from the accelerated approval studies, but rather triplet combinations to overcome the genomic and immunologic complexity of heavily pretreated MM. The choice of the third agent is based on efficacy, toxicity, and approval/availability. Such triplet combinations also allow weekly dosing of selinexor at a dose lower than that needed in the STORM study, with attendant reduction in toxicity. Attention must also be given to monitoring for corticosteroid toxicities (e.g. cataracts) and making appropriate dose adjustments.",
