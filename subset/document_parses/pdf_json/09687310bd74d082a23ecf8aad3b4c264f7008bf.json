Among the studies on the spread of the COVID-19, few studies have investigated the repeated outbreaks in stages, and the quantitative condition of a controllable spread has not been revealed. In this paper, a brief compartmental model is developed. The effective reproduction number (ERN) of the model is interpreted by the ratio of net newly infectious individuals to net isolation infections to assess the controllability of the spread of COVID-19. It is found that the value of the ERN at the inflection point of the pandemic is equal to one. The effectiveness of the quarantine, even the treatment, is parametrized in various stages with Gompertz functions to increase modeling accuracy. The impacts of the vaccinations are discussed by adding a vaccinated compartment. The results show that the sufficient vaccinations can make the inflection point appear early and significantly reduce subsequent increases in newly confirmed cases. The analysis of the ERNs of COVID-19 in the United States, Spain, France, and Peru confirms that the condition of a repeated outbreak is to relax or lift the interventions related to isolation and quarantine interventions to a level where the ERN is greater than one.",

From the viewpoint of the spread of the pandemic in population, many compartmental models were effectively developed from the SIR (Susceptible-Infectious-Removed) model [2] and the SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Removed) model [3] to describe the spread dynamics of the pandemic considering different preventive measures or negative actions [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . A developed SEIR model considering asymptomatic individuals has been proposed to estimate the spread risk of the COVID-19 and assess the impact on public health [4] . Liu et al. [5] have modeled a variant SIR model that evaluates the effects of the isolation with an exponential decline in transmission rate in China. Rong et al. [6] have established a model taking the effect of delay in diagnosis into account and studied the dependence of model parameters on the basic reproduction number. Moreover, the impacts of zoonotic spread and emigration have also been considered in a conceptual model [7] . Nonetheless, dynamic models have been rarely established from the perspective of infection controllability to assess the controllability of the pandemic.",

Therefore, the research on the prevention and predictions for the second outbreak, even the repeated outbreaks, are still hotpots [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . Wang et al. [15] investigated the impact of asymptomatic individuals on the second outbreak. The study of the pandemic in China outside Hubei [16] indicated that carefully monitoring the confirmed case-fatality risk, extremely restrict quarantine measures and instantaneous reproduction number can provide a reference for preventing the potential repeated outbreaks. The second outbreak in Spain and India was also predicted by relaxing the control measures to various extents [17, 18] . Ho et al. [19] developed a mobile app named Social distancing 2.0, to avoid the repeated outbreaks, and assessed the impact of the adoption rate of this app on the basic reproduction number. Nevertheless, the assessments or predictions of the pandemic have been rarely linked to staged public health interventions or the staged change of the newly confirmed cases, and few studies have explored the relationship between the ERN and the dominant interventions to control the outbreak. We found that for repeated outbreaks, it is difficult to simulate the complete evolution of the pandemic without staged investigation and functional parameterization.",

The date interval between the start date of lockdown and the start date of the first relaxation of the lockdown is the second stage (S 2 ), also named the lockdown period.

The frequent infections occurred, and the daily increase exceeded 20,000, while the ERN has not increased much due to better quarantine measures and an already more mature medical system. During S 9 , a weak rebound in newly confirmed cases appeared with a increased the ERN compared to that of S 8 , while a\u00f0t\u00de decreased which illustrates that although the pandemic spread at a lower a\u00f0t\u00de, the spread controllability of the pandemic was weaken caused by the drop of the quarantine intensity. From Table 4 and Fig. 5b , it is evident that S 10 corresponds to the third outbreak with decreased a\u00f0t\u00de \u00bc 0:29 (Table 4) , and the ERN generally fluctuates around one, reflecting that the spread of the pandemic has not been significantly alleviated, but the overall quarantine intensity has increased so that the spread was not too violent. It can be seen from Fig. 5b that the ERN of inflection points of the pandemic is almost equal to one. Among them, the inflection point of the first outbreak occurred roughly on March 22, 2020, and the second November 14, 2020, the third March 18, 2021.

During repeated outbreaks, the infectious proportion and the healed proportion have significantly decreased and increased, respectively, demonstrating that the controllability of the spread of the pandemic and the treatment level has been dramatically enhanced compared to the initial period of the first outbreak. This is why the ERN in the subsequent outbreaks is smaller than that in the initial period of the first outbreak. However, there are still a large number of infectious individuals in the subsequent outbreaks, indicating that there is no direct correspondence between the controllability of the pandemic and the number of the infectious individuals.",

As shown in Fig. 8 , the ERNs of all four countries become less than one from the inflection point, fluctuate near one in the transition period, and are greater than one again in subsequent outbreaks. Overall, the ERN of repeated outbreaks is essentially smaller than that of the early period of the first outbreak because the COVID-19 response mechanism has already matured. Therefore, although the situation of repeated outbreaks varies from country to country, it is clear that the ERN exactly characterizes of the controllability of the spread of the pandemic.

A re-lockdown is unlikely for the countries with a slight rebound in newly confirmed cases, contrary to the original intention of deregulation to restore the economy. However, interventions like contact tracing, quarantine of cross-regional traffic ports and imported products, etc., are necessary to be implemented. Contact tracing quickly identifies sources of newly infections and isolates the suspected infections, contributing to the decrease in a\u00f0t\u00de and meanwhile, the increase in b\u00f0t\u00de. Quarantine of cross-regional traffic ports and imported products prevents the transregional spread of undiagnosed cases and imported infections from overseas, which prevents a large-scale outbreak; a localized outbreak is still possible. For heavily affected areas, an extension of the coverage of nucleic acid testing is even necessary and more thorough action of screening potential infections, especially for diagnosing asymptomatic infections.",

Vaccination can quickly reduce the susceptible population, form an effective immune group, dilute the transmission process, and save treatment costs, etc. an epidemic model. In data fitting, Gompertz functions were introduced to estimate the effectiveness of quarantine interventions and treatment; the results completely simulate the development of the pandemics. The development of the pandemic was quantified as the evolution of the ERN, and the simulated results illustrated that the ERN being greater than one caused by the relaxation or lift of isolation or quarantine interventions would lead a repeated pandemic. Furthermore, we modified the model considering the impacts of the vaccinations, the results showed that the increase in the daily vaccinated cases of COVID-19 can apparently suppress the uptrend in newly confirmed cases and quickly prevent the pandemic to a controllable level. We also advised maintaining or strengthening the interventions like contact tracing, quarantine of cross-regional traffic ports and imported products, etc., to prevent a largescale repeated outbreak before most people are vaccinated. In this study, some factors such as economics and case import have not been taken into consideration, and the coherence between parameters and real data needs to be improved.",
