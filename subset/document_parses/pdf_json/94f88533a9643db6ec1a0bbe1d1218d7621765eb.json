In the early stages of the disease outbreak, people generally lacked awareness of the new coronavirus, and the implementation of prevention and control measures, such as lockdowns, definitely had a huge impact on the quality of life and physical and mental health of the human population (Wu and McGoogan, 2020) .",

Each of these had different effects on different regions and different groups of people. Among them, medical personnel are the frontliners in the fight against these deadly viruses. During the SARS period, significant psychological changes were found in patients with SARS and high-risk medical staff, suggesting that they may have varying degrees of negative psychological states (Kisely et al., 2020) . Young resident physicians who were directly involved in the diagnosis and treatment of patients with new coronavirus infections had mental health and psychological risks that deserve more attention. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to assess the mental health status of Chinese resident physicians using the Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) self-rating scale and to understand the impact of the epidemic on the mental health of these residents.",

            "text": "Up to February 11, 2020, a total of 72,314 COVID-19 cases have been reported in mainland China. Most of these patients were aged between 30 and 79 years old, accounting for 86.6% of the total reported cases (Chinese Center For Disease Control And Prevention, 2020). Relatively few reports of children and adolescents were documented. In recent years, with the continuous increase of public emergencies, the demand for highquality emergency care is increasing. In fact, in our traditional society, people, as members of society, will have varying degrees of psychological impact due to the acceleration of their lives, changes in family conflicts, and pressure at work. In 2018, Yu et al. (2019) used a cluster sampling method in 12 cities in China and applied a large-scale SCL-90 test to survey Chinese people whose age ranged from 18 to 60 years. This study found that young people may have higher risk of having psychological problems. Furthermore, a British survey also suggested that 31.6% of doctors felt excessive anxiety, 61.7% felt depression, and 46.7% had sleep disorders (Vincent et al., 2015) . It shows that the psychological changes in medical staff fluctuate with negative stimulus factors, i.e., pain, anxiety, illness, and death, they face each day of their lives. As a special group in clinical work, resident physicians have relatively little clinical experience and lack of emergency response. Thus, their psychological aspects need to withstand greater challenges. Current studies have shown that residents are prone to psychological problems. In addition, the incidence of depression or depressive symptoms among them is annually increasing from 20.9 to 43.2% (Al-Maddah et al., 2015; Mata et al., 2015) . At the same time, they appear to be a high-risk group for suicide. This demonstrated that the new coronavirus pandemic has a greater psychological impact on young doctors. As clinical medical staff at the frontline, they initially had little understanding of the new coronavirus and, therefore, had insufficient psychological preparation and knowledge. Furthermore, they are exposed to medical sharps, blood, and body fluids of patients, increasing the risk of infection. Moreover, their work environment has changed due to the increase in workload and the need for prevention and control measures, which, along with the fear of infections for themselves and their family members, has greatly increased their risk for psychological problems. If these psychological problems are not immediately solved, they will not only endanger the physical and mental health of fellow doctors, but also cause medical errors and mistakes during clinical treatment (Zhang et al., 2019) . Therefore, as an important stage in the transformation of qualified doctors, the mental health of young doctors should be carefully monitored. Long-term mental illness will lead to severe diseases in the neurological or endocrine systems (Deng et al., 2018) . Therefore, resident physicians have become a high-risk group for mental illnesses. Hence, their psychological problems should receive extensive attention.",

In our study, we had a higher percentage of psychological problems among resident physicians during the COVID-19 pandemic. Judging from the positive detection rate of psychological symptoms, psychological problems such as hostility, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, and compulsion were major causes. In particular, the severe unhealthy mental state was mainly caused by two symptoms, namely, hostility and somatization. Hostility is manifested as boredom in daily life and an inability to control one's temper, whereas somatization is mainly manifested in physical discomfort from time to time, including discomforts in the cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems, such as headaches, backaches, and muscle aches. Recent studies have shown that after an emergency breakout, approximately 70% of psychological trauma can be healed automatically, whereas the remaining 30% of these cases will later have a series of psychological and physical symptoms, including anxiety, depression, physical disorders, eating and sleep disorders, and alcohol or drug dependence (Yao, 2008) . Therefore, it is beneficial for public health to pay special attention to the mental health of resident physicians. Building a good psychological support and intervention system and assisting these frontline medical staff to actively cope with pressure are conducive approaches, stimulating the enthusiasm of these young doctors (Xu et al., 2018) .",

In addition, particular attention needs to be paid to doctors in emergency and ICU departments who work during the epidemic. However, the shortcomings of this survey include our method of distribution of the questionnaires. We distributed electronic questionnaires using the internet, hence it is not yet possible to accurately verify the identity of the research subjects and the authenticity and representativeness of the content filled in them. Furthermore, the research sample size is not yet sufficient, and there is a lack of data tracking mechanisms, so it is temporarily impossible to assess whether the above psychological problems will exist for a long time.
