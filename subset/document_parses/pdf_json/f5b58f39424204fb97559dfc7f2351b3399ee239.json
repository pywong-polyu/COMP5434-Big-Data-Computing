We used flow cytometry and single cell RNA-sequencing to understand how the heterogeneity of this diverse cell population contributes to elements of viral tropism and pathogenesis, antiviral immunity, and treatment response to remdesivir. We found that, while a variety of epithelial cell types are susceptible to infection, ciliated cells are the predominant cell target of SARS-CoV-2. The host protease TMPRSS2 was required for infection of these cells. Importantly, remdesivir treatment effectively inhibited viral replication across cell types, and blunted hyperinflammatory responses. Induction of interferon responses within infected cells was rare and there was significant heterogeneity in the antiviral gene signatures, varying with the burden of infection in each cell. We also found that heavily infected secretory cells expressed abundant IL-6, a potential mediator of COVID-19 pathogenesis.",

The cellular tropism of SARS-CoV-2 may impact several aspects of the disease, including viral spread within and between hosts, mechanisms of immune control of infection or tissue pathology, and the therapeutic response to promising antivirals. Normal human tracheal bronchial epithelial (nHTBE) cells represent a diverse mix of ciliated epithelial cells, secretory cells, and basal cells that form a pseudostratified epithelium when cultured at the air-liquid interface, phenocopying the upper airway in humans [1, 2] . Importantly, cells in this culture system also express endogenous levels of critical host factors including ACE2 and host proteases such as TMPRSS2 that are needed for SARS-CoV-2 viral entry [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . This model also demonstrates key aspects of host antiviral epithelial immunity [8, 9] . Recently, several studies using primary human lung cell cultures and respiratory cells isolated from SARS-CoV-2 infected patients have identified SARS-CoV-2 tropism for ciliated and secretory cells in the upper airway [10] [11] [12] [13] . However, the heterogeneity of virus replication and induction of antiviral genes and proinflammatory cytokines within these cells is still unknown.",

We subsequently identified different cell types using the expression of several surface markers and SiR-tubulin (Fig. 1C) and found that the ratio of different cell types in each culture remained similar during infection, regardless of anti-viral treatments (Fig. 1D ). Among mNG + SARS-CoV-2 infected cells, we discovered a preponderance of ciliated (SiR-tubulin + CD271 -) and few infected secretory cells (CD66c + SiR-tubulin -CD271 -) (Fig. 1E) . We also identified a subset of infected cells lacking cell type-specific markers (termed \"triple negative\") and a population of cells expressing intermediate levels of CD271 and CD66c, but negative for SiR-tubulin, termed \"other\". We did not identify mNG+ basal cells (CD271 + SiR-tubulin -CD66c -). We also observed that ciliated cells expressed the highest mNG MFI, suggesting that this cell type is the most permissive for SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig.   1F ). These data are consistent with recent reports demonstrating ciliated cells as a dominant target cell of SARS-CoV-2 [10] [11] [12] [13] 30] , and they suggest that basal cells are relatively resistant to infection. We next evaluated if the antiviral activity of remdesivir varies in different cell types depending on cellular uptake and metabolism [10] , which could differ dramatically within the diverse population of cells in the upper respiratory tract. To determine how remdesivir impacts viral replication across all susceptible cells in the upper airway, we pretreated nHTBE cells with remdesivir at 0.1\u00b5M, a dose expected to inhibit 80% of SARS-CoV-2 replication [10] and infected with icSARS-CoV-2-mNG. As a positive control for antiviral activity, we also pretreated cells with IFN\u03b2, which completely abrogated infection in nHTBE cells ( Fig. 1A and B), consistent with recent results demonstrating sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 to interferon [31] [32] [33] . Remdesivir reduced both the number of SARS-CoV-2 infected cells by ~5-fold and the expression level of mNG within infected cells ( Fig. 1B and F) .",

Using this threshold for infection enables us to discriminate between cells that are productively infected from those with low-level viral RNA. Additionally, we confirmed viral replication kinetics with and without remdesivir by qRT-PCR, using a SARS-CoV-2 standard to calculate total viral genome copies (Fig. S1A ). Together these results show a distinct impact of remdesivir treatment on SARS-CoV-2 viral reads per cell, consistent with our flow cytometry results.",

Ciliated cells were a major infected group at 24 and 48 hpi ( Fig. 3B and D) , consistent with our flow cytometry data. We also observed heavily infected cells that did not cluster by cell type at 48 hpi (Fig. 3D) , possibly due to loss of cell markers during SARS-CoV-2 infection, as has also been observed with influenza infection [36] . Similar to what others have observed [11, 12, 37] , we found low level expression of ACE2 in our primary human epithelial cells (Fig. 3A-E) , likely reflecting the limited sensitivity of scRNA sequencing. We therefore validated these findings using qRT-PCR and detected low ACE2 (30.4 ct) which increased after IFN\u03b2 treatment (26.07 ct, ~25 fold) (Fig. S1B) , consistent with other studies [7, 33] . Interestingly, we also observed augmented of the host protease TMPRSS2, implicated in SARS-CoV-2 entry [32142651], within ciliated cells, secretory cells, and ionocytes, but reduced or no expression in basal cells ( Fig. 3A-E) . To determine if TMPRSS2 is the primary protease utilized for SARS-CoV-2 entry in differentiated nHTBE cells we treated cells with the TMPRSS2 inhibitor camostat. Camostat has been shown to block pseudovirus infection in undifferentiated primary human lung [5] and SARS-CoV-2 infection in immortalized Calu3 cells [5, 38] . Consistent with these results, blocking TMPRSS2 resulted in a near complete abrogation of infection in both ciliated and secretory cells (Fig. 3F ).",

Interestingly, we found cells with high levels of virus and low levels of IFN expression, potentially representing the successful evasion by SARS-CoV-2 of virus sensing pathways triggered by MDA5 or RIGI. At 48 hpi we observed two clusters of undefined cells, both with high SARS-CoV2 replication but divergent IFN responses: cluster 3 with high IFN induction and cluster 5 with reduced IFN. This disparate induction of IFN could indicate opposite outcomes of SARS-CoV-2 infection that drive differential transcriptomic clustering. We identified very few (~0.5% at 24hpi) cells actively transcribing IFN, consistent with observations in other viral infections where a small number of IFN-producing cells is sufficient to establish the antiviral state [24, 25] . Despite this, we detected robust induction of ISGs (Fig.   4C ). We evaluated ISGs with the greatest differences across sample condition and found several discrete patterns of expression. This analysis revealed ISGs that were only present in clusters of cells characterized with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 4C , MICB and GEM). We also observed an ISG (MT1F) that was preferentially induced within ciliated cells (Fig. 4C) . At 48 hpi cells with the highest levels of viral RNA (clusters 3 and 5) had significantly lower levels of expression of several ISGs (DDIT, IFITM3, LY6E, TNFSF10), suggesting an impaired cellular antiviral immune response that enables unchecked SARS-CoV-2 replication (Fig. 4C) .",

            "text": "A recent study has demonstrated increased accumulation of remdesivir triphosphate in human airway epithelial cultures compared to Calu-3 and Vero cell cultures [17] . This study only addressed the accumulation and efficacy in readouts from total airway epithelial cell cultures. Here we are able to observe remdesivir efficacy in all of our individually defined cell populations using actual viral replication as the readout. In addition to blocking virus replication, remdesivir may also provide benefits from blocking induction of proinflammatory cytokines while maintaining antiviral signaling. We uncovered differential expression of the entry factor Coronaviruses employ diverse mechanisms to evade detection and induction of IFN. The exact mechanisms SARS-CoV-2 uses are unclear. However, SARS-CoV-2 clearly deploys successful strategies as induction of IFN within infected cells is rare ( Fig. 4A and B) . While SARS-CoV-2 is proficient at evading IFN induction in most cells, it seems to be poor at countering effects of ISGs. Consistent with several recent reports, we demonstrate that SARS-CoV-2 is highly sensitive to IFN treatment (Fig. 1) [31] [32] [33] . We have previously identified ISGs in epithelial cells associated with high levels of virus replication [27] . Congruently, cells with high levels of SARS-CoV-2 reads had significantly increased expression of some of these same ISGs including GEM (Fig. 4D) , RIPK2, PIM3, and ODC1 (Supplemental table 3 ). We have previously demonstrated a number of cell type specific ISGs during influenza A virus infection in mice [27] . Interestingly, we also identified a cell type-specific ISG (MT1F) induced during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which was primarily expressed in ciliated epithelial cells. A better understanding of both the heterogeneity of ISG responses and cell-type specific .

We observed several clusters that were characterized by a preponderance of infected cells (Fig. 2C); each of these clusters contained cells from different experimental conditions (Fig. 2D). For example heavily infected cells in clusters 2 and 7 are derived from cells infected at 24hpi, 24hpi with remdesivir and 48hpi. Consistent with our flow cytometry results, cells of a variety of phenotypes localized to each of these dominant infected cell clusters. Interestingly, the majority of cells treated with remdesivir (Fig. 2A and Fig. S1A) clustered most closely with mock-infected cells. This clearly demonstrates the antiviral efficacy of remdesivir and suggests that the presence of active SARS-CoV-2 replication is the strongest driver of transcriptomic phenotype in this cell population. These data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infected airway epithelial cells adopt diverse transcriptional profiles dominated by both viral RNA level and cell type.
