We established an ongoing prospective cohort of 3,840 SARS-CoV-2positive individuals according to RT-PCR in the Delhi-National Capital Region of India to document clinical and immunological characteristics during illness and convalescence. The immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to the receptor binding domain (RBD) and nucleocapsid were assessed at 0 to 7 days, 10 to 28 days, and 6 to 10 weeks after infection. The clinical predictors of seroconversion were identified by multivariable regression analysis. The seroconversion rates during the postinfection windows of 0 to 7 days, 10 to 28 days, and 6 to 10 weeks were 46%, 84.7%, and 85.3%, respectively (N = 743). The proportion with a serological response increased with the severity of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). All participants with severe disease, 89.6% with mild to moderate infection, and 77.3% of asymptomatic participants had IgG antibodies to the RBD antigen. The threshold values for the nasopharyngeal viral RNA RT-PCR of a subset of asymptomatic and symptomatic seroconverters were comparable (P = 0.48) to those of nonseroconverters (P = 0.16) (N = 169). This is the first report of longitudinal humoral immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 over a period of 10 weeks in South Asia. The low seropositivity of asymptomatic participants and differences between assays highlight the importance of contextualizing the understanding of population serosurveys.",

The clinical phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 infection varies across a spectrum ranging from asymptomatic to mild (moderate) illness to severe COVID-19. The proportions of the specific phenotypes differ with geographical location. 1 Prospectively followed cohorts of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals have provided the opportunity to accurately describe the clinical characteristics of the disease in diverse geographical settings during different time periods of evolution of the pandemic. When combined with a systematic collection of biospecimens, such cohorts can serve as useful platforms to answer the emerging questions of importance to public health.",

Results of seroprevalence studies performed in India and other South Asian countries may need to be adjusted after considering our findings. 18, 19 The S/Co ratio for both assays reached the maxima between 15 and 28 days and plateaued, suggesting a stable IgG response during up to 10 weeks of illness. The longevity of the IgG response has been reported to vary between 5 weeks to 4 months. 13, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] As shown by another global study, asymptomatic participants in our study did not show any decline in the IgG response to either antigen during a period of 10 weeks. 25 This is in contrast to the initial evidence that showed early decline in the IgG response in asymptomatic infected individuals. 3, 13 We will follow-up the participants in this cohort for at least 1 year to evaluate the longevity of the IgG response.",

Because of the lack of robust IgM and IgA assays, we were unable to evaluate the immune response to these isotypes. Furthermore, because of the heterogeneity of the RT-PCR assays used by the participating hospitals for molecular diagnosis, we do not have comparable viral load data for all participants in our study. However, an analysis of a subset of the individuals who had similar RT-PCR assay results showed no differences in nasopharyngeal viral loads between seroconverters and nonseroconverters. The 95% CI for the association between the presence of anti-RBD IgG antibodies at enrollment and the severity of COVID-19 is wide, with the lower bound of the interval close to 1, suggesting the need for a larger sample size to confirm the association.",
