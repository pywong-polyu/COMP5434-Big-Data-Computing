The rate of spread of the disease was slow in the initial three months of the first outbreak in Kerala in January 2020, possibly because of the early nationwide lockdown (2) (3) (4) ; widespread coverage about the pandemic in print, electronic and social media (5) , and targeted efforts by the union and state governments on quarantine facilities and travel protocols (6, 7) . With the demarcation of local containment zones, these definitive measures significantly reduced the doubling time (S1Fig.), although there is no sign of stalling in the infection rates. There is a rapid increase in the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in many districts. India has been recording over 50,000 new cases every day since Despite such a fast spread of COVID-19, India has a fairly high recovery rate and the lowest fatality rate globally (8) . Despite India's advantage of having a young age structure less susceptible to COVID-19 related deaths (9) . India may have to undergo a higher burden of disease shortly due to other demographic factors (10) such as the enormous population size, high population density, higher percentage of people living in poverty, lower levels of per capita public health infrastructure, and a high prevalence of co-morbid situations.",

            "text": "Like any other health and demographic indicator, COVID-19 infection varies widely among the different states of the country (11, 12) . However, the geographical pattern of the COVID-19 infection rate' does not coincide with the patterns of demographic and health indicators such as the under-five mortality rate or nutritional status. COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly in the urban areas, especially in states with megacities with densely populated urban slums like Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. The sudden surge of return labour migration to the states of origin (due to COVID-19 related national lockdown), state-level health care system, adherence to physical distancing measures, and local government management are other potential community-level factors affecting geographical variations in the spread of COVID-19 in India. Some recent studies have computed composite indices to rank the districts in terms of their COVID-19 vulnerabilities using demographic information and infrastructure characteristics (13) (14) (15) . While such analyses are useful for district-level planning and prioritization they are based on the assumption that vulnerability will decrease as -the districts' socio-economic indicators improve. However, such an inverse relationship may not be applicable in the rare COVID-19 context; for instance, a higher percentage of urban population may indicate a higher socio-economic status of the district population in a non-COVID situation but maybe positively correlated with the spread of COVID-19. COVID-19 is more prevalent in cities and towns than in rural areas or hilly regions (16) .Therefore, it is imperative to unfold the empirical relationship patterns between the district's socio-economic and infrastructural characteristics and the COVID-19 infection ratio. To the best of our knowledge, no such previous study has been conducted on COVID-19 in India. This study examined the district level socio-economic and demographic correlations of COVID-19 infection ratio in India.",

Finally, there is need to improve infrastructure (hospitals, ventilators, PPE kits), and human resources (doctors, nurses, and frontline workers) in healthcare facilities. Our analysis does have a few limitations. First, there is a possibility of under-reporting positive and fatal cases due to a lack of testing or social stigma. Hence our data gives the most conservative estimates of infection ratio. Second, for most cases, the patients' level of information (such as age, sex, and co-morbidity) is unavailable.

In the S2 Table, we showed the state-wise Infection Rate (IR) per one hundred thousand population till July 31, 2020. India showed that the IR is 42.38 per 100 hundred thousand people. The highest IR was observed in Andhra Pradesh (145.0), followed by Maharashtra (123.59) and lowest in Chhattisgarh (10.12). However, the states like Delhi (54.03), and Southern states Tamil Nadu (76.58), Telangana (45.13), Karnataka (109.43), and Jammu Kashmir (58.81) showed IR above the national average.

Four districts (South East Delhi, Kamrup Metropolitan, North Delhi, and Pune) have IR ranging between 1000 to 2000 per one hundred thousand population.

The 'Moran's I value of 0.333 represents a positive spatial clustering level in the COVID-19 infection rate over neighbouring districts. Hotspots of COVID-19 were observed in the parts of Konkan coast of Maharashtra (Palghar, Mumbai, Thane, Nashik, and Satara); the southern part from Tamil Nadu (Chennai, Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur, Virudhunagar, and Ramanathapuram); parts of Delhi; the northern part of Jammu & Kashmir (Ganderbal and Pulwama) whereas cold-spots were observed in central, north-western and north-eastern regions of India. Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the outcome variable (Infection Ratio) and the 26 selected exposure variables for the 640 districts. The average infection ratio is 108.40, and the values vary between 0 and 5918.43 per one hundred thousand population. The IR is zero in the two districts from Arunachal Pradesh (Dibang valley, KrumungKumey) and another two districts from the Union Territories (Lakshadweep and Nicobar). All district-level socio-economic variables differ substantially among districts. For example, the mean percent of the old age population (60 and above) is 8.33, and it varies between 2.46 per cent to 17.82 per cent among the districts of India. The percent of women whose husbands are away for the last 6 months, a proxy indicator of district-level outmigration, ranged substantially between 1.36 per cent to observed massive variation in the districts' socio-economic variables, viz, percent Hindu, urban, and ST population vary between 0 percent to 100 percent in India's districts. On average, 2.92 persons sleep in one room in the Indian districts. On average, 48.14 per cent of the households have water facilities, and 61.41 per cent have toilet facilities within the household premise.

The percentage of women whose husbands were away for six months is associated negatively with IR (\u03b2: -0.65, CI: -5.02-7.99). Compared to those with low literacy rates, districts with higher literacy rates showed 7.1 times higher likelihood of COVID-19 infection.

Districts with high diabetic patients have 21.05-fold higher chance of COVID-19 infection in comparison to those with low prevalence of diabetes. However, percentage of women consuming tobacco and percentage of children with stunting condition was associated positively with COVID-19 prevalence.
