            "text": "With the growing evidence on the variable human susceptibility against COVID-19, it is evident that some genetic loci modulate the severity of the infection. Recent studies have identified several loci associated with greater severity. More recently, a study has identified a 50 kb genomic segment introgressed from Neanderthal adding a risk for COVID-19, and this genomic segment is present among 16% and 50% people of European and South Asian descent, respectively. Our studies on ACE2 identified a haplotype present among 20% and 60% of European and South Asian populations, respectively, which appears to be responsible for the low case fatality rate among South Asian populations. This result was also consistent with the real-time infection rate and case fatality rate among various states of India. We readdressed this issue using both of the contrasting datasets and compared them with the real-time infection rates and case fatality rate in India. We found that the polymorphism present in the 50 kb introgressed genomic segment (rs10490770) did not show any significant correlation with the infection and case fatality rate in India.",

            "text": "In contrast to the conclusions drawn by Zeberg and P\u00e4\u00e4bo 9 , our study on ACE2 identified a haplotype that is frequent among South Asians and East Eurasians [11] [12] [13] . This haplotype is derived by a polymorphism rs2285666 responsible for elevated expression of ACE2. We have found high inverse correlation of this haplotype with the state-wise cases as well as the case-fatality rate (CFR) among Indian populations 13 . This correlation was significant at various timelines of the pandemic in India (Table 1) . We verified the statistical tests with the updated data up to December 2020 and found these data to be consistent with previous observations ( Fig. 1 and Supplementary  Fig. S1 ). Thus, it is likely that the ACE2 SNP rs2285666 has played a significant role in modulating the susceptibility to the disease among Indian populations. In our search of the SNPs reported to be associated with high risk by Zeberg and P\u00e4\u00e4bo 9 , we found rs10490770 from genome-wide datasets 17, 18, [21] [22] [23] . We applied the same tests done for the ACE2 SNPs (Fig. 1) . The state-wise frequency variation of this SNP did not show any association either with the number of cases or the CFR (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1 ). We repeated these regression tests for the number of cases as well as the CFR data, obtained during all the three months. However, none of them showed any association with the rs10490770 (p > 0.3) ( Table 1) . It is interesting to note that this SNP (rs10490770) has been found to be associated with disease severity in the global data 8 . However, the lack of association for rs10490770 with COVID-19 cases or CFR in India is striking and suggests instead a complex susceptibility response among Indian populations. Along with the complex genetic structure 11, 24 , socio-economic status 25 and hygiene 26 may have contributed to such a complex scenario. Furthermore, a detailed clinical and genome-wide association study on Indian COVID-19 patients would be useful to resolve this complexity.",

By considering the effect of sex, age, socio-economic deprivation and region, this report found that people of Bangladeshi origin had double the risk of mortality as compared to people of British origin. However, the higher mortality rate for Bangladeshi population in the UK needs more detailed investigation on comorbidity, genetic admixture as well as local environment and socio-economic circumstances in their particular British context. More importantly, a similar trend had also been observed among admixed Americans, where some of the same qualifications may apply mutatis mutandis [27] [28] [29] . Furthermore, it is notable that among the Bangladeshi samples analysed by us, the tribal populations of Bangladesh showed almost three times less frequency of rs10490770 (Supplementary Table S1 ). This is likely due to the different population histories of the caste and tribal populations of Bangladesh 30,31 . The Tibeto-Burman speakers of Bangladesh show a closer genetic affinity with the East and Southeast Asian populations, whereas the Indo-European speaking caste Table 1 .

Therefore, it is advised explicitly to differentiate between the caste and tribal populations while making any statement about Bangladeshi populations. Significantly, our data also show that the incidence of the allele rs2285666 has been found to occur in the highest frequency of 100% in Indian populations such as the Nishi and Kokborok (Tripuri), who represent Trans-Himalayan language communities ( Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1 ). As a linguistic phylum, the Trans-Himalayan language family is widespread in parts of eastern Eurasia and includes languages such as Tibetan, Burmese, Mandarin, Cantonese and Hokkien. Thus, our extensive analyses on real-time data did not show any association of rs10490770 with the state-wise infection rates as well as CFRs, suggesting that the risk allele for COVID-19 in Europe does not play a significant role in COVID-19 severity in South Asia.",
