            "text": "Background: Pain relief in the prehospital setting is often insufficient, as the administration of potent intravenous analgesic drugs is mostly reserved to physicians. In Australia, inhaled methoxyflurane has been in routine use by paramedics for decades, but experience in Central European countries is lacking. Thus, we aimed to assess whether user friendliness and effectiveness of inhaled methoxyflurane as sole analgesic match the specific capabilities of local ground and air-based EMS systems in Austria. Methods: Observational study in adult trauma patients (e.g. dislocations, fracture or low back pain following minor trauma) with moderate to severe pain (numeric rating scale [NRS] \u22654). Included patients received a Penthrop\u00ae inhaler containing 3 mL of methoxyflurane (maximum use 30 min). When pain relief was considered insufficient (NRS reduction < 3 after 10 min), intravenous analgesics were administered by an emergency physician. The primary endpoint was effectiveness of methoxyflurane as sole analgesic for transport of patients. Secondary endpoints were user friendliness (EMS personell), time to pain relief, vital parameters, side effects, and satisfaction of patients. Results: Median numeric pain rating was 8.0 (7.0-8.0) in 109 patients. Sufficient analgesia (reduction of NRS \u22653) was achieved by inhaled methoxyflurane alone in 67 patients (61%). The analgesic effect was progressively better with increasing age. Side effects were frequent (n = 58, 53%) but mild. User satisfaction was scored as very good when pain relief was sufficient, but fair in patients without benefit. Technical problems were observed in 16 cases (14.7%), mainly related to filling of the inhaler. In every fifth use, the fruity smell of methoxyflurane was experienced as unpleasant. No negative effects on vital signs were observed. Conclusion: In prehospital use, inhaled methoxyflurane as sole analgesic is effective for transport of trauma patients (62%) with moderate to severe pain. Older patients benefit especially from inhaled methoxyflurane. Side effects are mild and vital parameters unaffected. Thus, inhaled methoxyflurane could be a valuable device for nonphysician EMS personnel rescue services also in the central Europe region.",

            "text": "The treatment of acute pain is a central task in emergency medicine [1, 2] . However, the quality and quantity of pain management in practice are often criticised [3, 4] . Although in principle a range of various analgesic drugs are available, it seems that they are not deployed to their full potential: Insufficient training, insufficient experience in assessing pain intensity and applying analgesics [3, 4] , and a lack of therapeutic standards are often mentioned as factors inhibiting their use [5] . Use of opioids may be limited due to concerns about relevant side effects and potential drug abuse, and in some jurisdictions (including Austria) by laws that reserve their use to emergency physicians. Non-opioid analgesics, on the other hand, are often associated with slower action and lower potency, though some studies suggest this may be mistaken [6] [7] [8] . Issues of insufficient training and experience may of course reflect that some drugs require specific skills in order to be handled successfully.",

Inhaled analgesics have considerable advantages in prehospital emergency medicine. They do not require an intravenous line, and the patients themselves can titrate the dosage: depending on the pain level, they can interrupt or increase the supply of the drug. The available substances nitrous oxide and methoxyfluraneare fast acting, have hardly any critical side effects in experienced hands [10, 11] and may be as effective as opioids [12] . In English-speaking countries, nitrous oxide (Entonox\u00ae) is well-proven in decades of use both in the prehospital and hospital settings, in the latter in combination with opioids [10, [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

To date, there are no published reports of serious side effects, in particular malignant hyperthermia [25] . Nitrous oxide has barely been taken up in Central Europe (despite intensive efforts of the industry and multiple positive studies [26, 27] ), while methoxyflurane was not even approved here until recently. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) authorization for methoxyflurane was only issued in 2018; in Austria it is approved as 'Penthrop\u00ae' (for therapy of moderate to severe pain. By now, besides the original trial for the authorization [28] , methoxyflurane has been studied in further prospective, randomized trials from France, Italy and Spain, all carried out in in-hospital emergency departments [29] [30] [31] . However, it is not yet possible to make an assessment on prehospital use of methoxyflurane by paramedics in Europe [32] .",

            "text": "However, the number of cases collected corresponds to the planned number for an interim analysis, and the amount of data collected is sufficient to draw some conclusions on the main questions. Almost two-thirds of patients who initially had very severe pain (median NRS 8) experienced a significant reduction in pain of 4 NRS points within 15 min of methoxyflurane. This corresponds to or is even better than reports to date from European emergency departments [28] [29] [30] . The onset of the analgesic effect was rapid, the emergency physicians rated the ease of use of the product as good and patients rated the analgesia as good. The effectiveness of the drug was noticeably, and in clinical terms significantly, better in older patients (no supplemental analgesia required for > 87% of the patients over 65 years old). This resulted in higher satisfaction of older patients despite a higher incidence of side effects. On the other hand, younger patients experienced insufficient analgesia more often, independent of sex and indication: half of the patients under 45 needed additional analgesia. This can be explained by the fact that the minimal alveolar concentration (MAC) of all inhaled anaesthetics declines with increasing age. It might be worthwhile for manufacturers to consider a way to provide variable doses for different age groups. This might improve the acceptance and applicability of the drug in younger patients. Methoxyflurane is certainly easier to handle than nitrous oxide [11, 20, 33] . However, the patients, especially if they are older, have to be carefully instructed how to use the inhaler; this is not necessarily easy to do in the acute situation with a patient in pain. The effectiveness depends on whether the patient has understood the instructions correctly and is able to implement them. The possibility of increasing the concentration by closing the 'dilutor hole' should only be mentioned after the patient has had a little time to get used to the drug, because if they inhale it at full concentration right away, they are likely to experience the taste as unpleasant (8.6%) and may reject the treatment. After five or six breaths this phenomenon usually disappears and the analgesia already becomes noticeable. Preparation of the inhaler in the current version was slightly vulnerable to errors: in one use in every seven, the filling step led to liquid leaking out of the mouthpiece onto the floor. This could impair the effectiveness of the drug or shorten the period one dose will last for. A new design of the device intended to prevent this problem is in development ( Fig. 2a and b , \"Penthrox\u00ae Inhaler Selfie\") and should be available in 2022 at the latest (verbal communication).",

In agreement with previous reports, the most common side effects reported by patients, on being asked, were feelings of mild dizziness, confusion and/or Fig. 2 a New Penthrox\u00ae inhaler \"selfie\". The new device will already include the active ingredient. 2b Penthrox\u00ae inhaler \"selfie\"how to use. Pressing the button releases the active ingredient onto the gauze and the device is ready for administration after 5 s inebriation (Table 3) . Interestingly, the patients tended to experience these side effects as not unwelcome. Only in one case (0.9%) was it necessary to stop the treatment because of a side effect (nausea) and the unpleasant taste. No relevant effects on vital functions were observed. And although methoxyflurane is less effective than intravenous or intranasal opioids [24] , the ease of administration, logistics and documentation, combined with the legal restrictions on administration of opioids by non-physician personnel, speak for the licensing of this drug for pre-hospital use by paramedical personnel in Europe. Often the need for rapid analgesia is needed most for patient repositioning manoeuvres: once the positioning is complete, further analgesia is often not crucial. Effective and safe analgesia by paramedics could reduce the number of callouts of emergency physicians and improve their availability for other, vitally endangered patients. In fact, in our study, almost half the patients served by ground ambulances were handed over to the paramedical emergency team without the need to place an intravenous line or give further analgesic medication. This explains the relatively short median attendance time of 34 min . Multiplied by the total number of callouts for the indication 'moderate to severe pain' this would indicate considerable potential for cases that could be managed by the non-physician emergency teams [2] . Penthrop\u00ae is also an interesting option for alpine mountain rescue. Whenever the time to arrival of an emergency physician is going to be longer, and in adverse conditions, such as winter weather, an effective form of analgesia without the need for an intravenous line would be a valuable addition to the paramedical emergency repertoire. The simple and quick availability can also be an advantage to emergency physicians: the self-titration by the patient was especially useful for rescues in difficult terrain, in alpine settings, and during transport in a rescue bag.",

            "text": "In prehospital use, inhaled methoxyflurane as sole analgesic is effective for transport of trauma patients (62%) with moderate to severe pain. During the SARS-CoV-19 pandemic or similar situations, the use of an inhaler can be seen as precarious. Especially older patients benefit from inhaled methoxyflurane. Side effects are mild and vital parameters are unaffected. Thus, inhaled methoxyflurane could be a valuable option for non-physician rescue services in Central Europe. Authors' contributions HT and MP conceived the study, examined data quality, analysed data and drafted the manuscript. WGV analysed data and revised the manuscript substantially. AE, RD and MP collected data and controlled data quality and carefully revised the manuscript. All authors contributed substantially to its revision. The authors read and approved the final manuscript.",
