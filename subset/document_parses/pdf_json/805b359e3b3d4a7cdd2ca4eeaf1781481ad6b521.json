A comprehensive analysis of environmental pollutants, economic growth, and public health is done using data from 28 OECD economies from 2002 to 2018. Panel fully modified least squares and the panel vector error correction model are used. The results show that there is long-run causality from renewable energy and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emissions to healthcare spending. Renewable energy and healthcare spending are positively and significantly related. It is concluded that investment in renewable energy leads to a reduction in air pollution, improvements in healthcare, and the promotion of economic growth.",

            "text": "In the last few years, tremendous growth in the healthcare industry has been seen for various economic, noneconomic, and environmental reasons, which is a serious concern for health economists, policymakers, and researchers. There are two views regarding healthcare expense. One group of researchers (Azam et al. 2019 ) believe that healthcare expenditure is a luxury, like a commodity, so it is necessary to rely on market forces. Another group (Chaabouni and Saidi 2017; Ye and Zhang 2018; Wang et al. 2019) believe that healthcare expenditure is necessary, and the government should intervene. Although significant spending on healthcare is necessary for economic development, excessive spending leads to an extra burden on government finances. Healthcare spending in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries has shown a tremendously increasing trend. OECD countries spend almost 85% of world spending on health, while the population of those countries is less than 20% of the world total (Bl\u00e1zquez-Fern\u00e1ndez et al. 2019) . OECD countries have the highest healthcare expenditure in the world. Figure 1 shows that, over time, healthcare expenditure increased gradually in OECD countries. In 2003 it was about 7.8% of gross domestic product (GDP), which increased to 8.8% in 2018, and is expected to reach 10.2% by 2030 (OECD 2019). One of the major challenges faced by the OECD is this continuous increase in healthcare expenses as a percentage of GDP. Figure 2 shows is a comparison between healthcare expenditure of the United States (US) and the other OECD countries. The graph shows that before 2007, the US had higher health expenditure compared to the OECD as a whole, and after 2007, there was a decrease in health expenditure due to its high cost, few people were able to cover the private health care which has ultimately reduced the health expenditure growth.",

            "text": "There are some positive effects of increasing healthcare expenses such as reduced illness and increased numbers of jobs, but unnecessary spending on healthcare means cuts have to be made elsewhere. Air pollution badly affects health and leads to an increase in healthcare expenditure. Pollutants include sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen dioxide, which cause respiratory diseases, pulmonary problems, asthma, food allergies, bronchitis, reduced lung growth, lung cancer, and reduced life expectancy (Sekar et al. 2016; Xie et al. 2018; Ma et al. 2018) . It is necessary to identify the major drivers of healthcare spending, which include environmental deterioration (air pollution), along with other economic (e.g., GDP, foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow) and noneconomic (e.g., education) factors. In the long run, there is a direct positive connection between health and education. Improved health is a significant feature in enhancing the productivity of the labor force. Investment in health and education leads to improved health and a higher level of education (Ross and Wu 1995) . Healthcare expenses are rising gradually in OECD countries. GDP is an important variable for the estimation of healthcare spending. In OECD countries, it is forecast that, due to more stringent healthcare policies, there is to be a drastic decrease in healthcare expenditure (Akca et al. 2017) . Increased healthcare expenditure is not solely by design, to improve health conditions, many factors contribute to healthcare expenses, such as the socioeconomic conditions, population, and the proportion of budget allocated to healthcare. The most important determinants of healthcare include GDP and the level of education in a country (Mirmirani et al. 2008) .",

Public financing includes health insurance and government expenditure, while private financing includes individuals' out of pocket payments and finances from corporations and NGOs. In OECD countries, there is more public spending than private. Nearly all populations in all OECD countries are provided with healthcare coverage. Mexico has the lowest health coverage as a proportion of population, Healthcare expenditure % of GDP % of GDP (Chaabouni et al. 2016) . Air pollution has three types of effect. Firstly, various studies show that mortality rates have a direct connection to air pollution. In other words, when air pollution increases in an environment, it has an adverse impact on human health, in both developed and developing countries (Li et al. 2019; Kayani et al. 2020) . Approximately 3.3 million people die annually in the world due to air pollution in the atmosphere (Dar\u00e7\u0131n 2017) . Secondly, ill health caused by air pollution leads to increased healthcare expenditure and adversely affects labor productivity. When productivity decreases, domestic output also decreases and the whole economic cycle slows down (Mehrara et al. 2011) . Thirdly, the social cost of air pollution is an area of concern for policymakers and economists. Effective air quality regulation requires an exact estimate of air pollution, but if pollution is overestimated, it leads to overregulation (Lu et al. 2017) , which ultimately affects the economic growth of a nation negatively.",

Investment in health can boost the economy of a country, and the researchers taking this viewpoint are in favor of huge government spending on the healthcare sector (Yao et al. 2019) . Another proposition, not as well developed, is that environmental degradation harms the economic growth of a country (Atilgan et al. 2017) . Apergis et al. (2017) state that the US market gives considerable importance to oil and natural gas. However, the increasing trend for renewable energy in OECD countries is decreasing the CO 2 emissions in a way that promotes a healthy environment. Additional renewable energy usage is recommended as an effective approach to fighting global warming (Apergis and Payne 2010; Jebli et al. 2016; Fernando et al. 2018) . Renewable energies improve public health by reducing air pollutants, promoting economic development, and creating jobs (Liu et al. 2020) . In most developed countries, renewable energies are already being used as a solution to environmental pollution by reducing the use of conventional energy sources (fossil fuels). Advancement of the green economy leads to new tools related to renewable Although several studies explore the importance of air pollution and healthcare expenditure, there are very few which investigate the relationships among air pollution, healthcare expenditure, and economic and noneconomic factors in OECD countries. Therefore, the present research covers this gap by conducting research in selected OECD countries into the role of renewable energy variables and various air pollutants and the role of the healthcare industry and economic growth. The study makes a threefold contribution. Firstly, the study checks the relationships between two air pollutants, COx and NOx, economic growth and healthcare spending. Secondly, the study incorporates renewable energy with healthcare and its link to growth. Thirdly, the study proposes policy implications of the use of renewable energy instead of conventional energy sources, considering the importance of public healthcare expenditure. Wang et al. (2019) study the connections among healthcare expenditure, economic growth, and CO 2 using an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) approach. The ARDL model provides robust findings irrespective of sample size, and provides unrestricted error correction. Khan et al. (2019) studies the relationship between investment, health, and the environment using the canonical cointegrating regression (CCR) model, which is ideal for removing second-order bias in the ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator. This paper employs the panel vector error correction model (VECM) and panel fully modified least squares (FMOLS) test, appropriate to the study, to identify the association and trend of the relationships among the variables in the model. The VECM is used to examine the path of causation. It limits the long-run behavior of the endogenous variables unless they converge and provide shortrun correction dynamics. FMOLS, introduced by Hansen and Phillips in 1990, is used to check the robustness of results, as it is ideal for a small amount of data. This method is ideal for achieving asymptotic efficiency by modifying the least squares and is used to estimate the association among the variables (Kalim and Shahbaz 2009) . The study reveals that there is a relationship between air pollution and healthcare expenditure and that the use of renewable energy has a substantial effect on healthcare spending that triggers economic growth. Noneconomic factors play an important role in healthcare spending.",

Air pollution is one of the core elements of the environment, and if air pollution is increased, it affects human health by affecting the metabolism. A wide strand of literature (Murthy and Okunade 2016; Chaabouni and Saidi 2017; Li et al. 2019 ) examines the connection between healthcare and air pollution. Yazdi and Khanalizadeh (2017) conduct a study exploring the major determinants of healthcare expenditure. The study uses economic and environmental quality variables, and takes data from the MENA region from 1995 to 2014. The ARDL model is used to reveal that emissions of carbon and particulates between 2.5 and 10 \u03bcm (PM10) have a significant and direct connection with healthcare expenditure. This means that when these gas emissions increase, healthcare expenditure also increases. Income is shown to have no relationship to healthcare expenditure. Other studies show similar results that high air pollution increases the mortality rate and there is a positive relationship between mortality and air pollution (Tran et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2020) . Chaabouni and Saidi (2017) inspect the nature of the connections among CO 2 emissions, GDP and healthcare. The data comes from 51 countries over the period 1995-2013. The countries are split into 3 groups according to income. The study uses a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and dynamic simultaneous-equations models for analysis. The results show that bidirectional connectedness is present between carbon discharge and GDP, and GDP and healthcare spending. Moreover, a unidirectional connection exists from CO 2 emissions to healthcare spending in most countries, except low-income countries. Saidi and Hammami (2016) find that environmental problems are mainly the result of high CO 2 discharge, which has an adverse effect on human health. The study is conducted in the African region from 1990 to 2015, and uses the ARDL model for analysis. The results show a positive association between economic growth and healthcare expenditure but a significant negative relationship between carbon emissions and healthcare expenditure. Some studies (Usman et al. 2019; Chaabouni and Saidi 2017) show similar results, proving that high air pollution increases the mortality rate, and it has a negative relationship with carbon emission or air pollution.",

There are two schools of thought regarding the link between healthcare spending and economic growth. According to the first (Omri et al. 2014; Ye and Zhang 2018; Usman et al. 2019 ), if a country is able to maintain a healthy lifestyle by spending more on healthcare, then the social welfare and life expectancy ratio of the average person is increased. In other words, if the health condition of workers is increased, then these healthy workers can work more efficiently and produce more effective outputs. The result of efficiency is that labor productivity is increased. These conditions cause a rise in the income of the country and (2019) explore a dynamic type of association in Pakistan using annual data over the period 1995 to 2017, using Granger causality and ARDL models to extract results from the data. The paper reveals that both short-run and long-run associations are present between most of the variables (CO 2 , healthcare spending, and economic growth). The Granger causality proves that bidirectional causality exists between carbon emissions and healthcare expenditure. The result proves a bidirectional causal relationship between carbon emissions and growth, and economic growth and grossfixed capital formation. Omri et al. (2014) conduct a study investigating stationarity and cointegration across variables including economic growth (GDP) and healthcare spending across 13 MENA region countries over the period 1995 to 2005. Unit root test findings reveal that nonstationarity exists between healthcare spending and economic growth (GDP). The study reveals that healthcare expenditure and economic growth are integrated, showing that there is an inverse relationship between healthcare expenditure and gross domestic product, and that healthcare spending is a necessity in the countries sampled.",

Healthcare expenditure has two elements, government expenditure and private expenditure. The study takes data from 13 emerging nations for the period 1994 to 2017. The research uses panel cointegration linear model bootstrapping to analyze the data. Most of the factors (carbon emissions, GDP, environment index, FDI, and education) are significantly related to healthcare spending (public and private). The study results reveal that air pollution (CO 2 emissions) and the environment index are significantly positively associated with public healthcare spending, but both measures have a significant negative relationship with private healthcare expenditure.

According to the author, healthcare expenditure decreases and labor productivity improves by using green energy. The use of renewable energy in logistic operations leads to a decrease in air pollutants, especially greenhouse gases, and improved health. This leads to an increase in economic growth by promoting efficiency among laborers. The more emphasis there is on environmental performance more it promotes investment. Apergis et al. (2018a, b) study the relationships between renewable energy, healthcare, and GDP in 42 African countries from 1995 to 2011.

The descriptive statistics, given in Table 2 , show that the GDP has the highest mean, while health expenditure has the lowest mean value and volatility. CO 2 emission has a mean value of 1.972, which shows high deviation from the mean value. GDP and renewable energy are negatively skewed, whereas GDP has the highest maximum value. Most of the variables are negatively skewed and leptokurtic. The output of the panel unit root test for individual variables is presented in Table 3 The null hypothesis is that there is unit root for all variables in the study. For the panel unit test, each variable under study has a unit root under the null hypothesis. At a 5% level of significance, we do not reject the null hypothesis for most variables. The results show that most of the variables are stationary at first difference, so the null hypothesis is rejected at a 5% level of significance. Table 4 shows the results of panel cointegration, tested by three methods: the Kao, Pedroni, and Johansen Fisher cointegration tests. In the Pedroni cointegration test, there is no association between the variables under study, confirming the null hypothesis. At the 5% and 1% level of significance, there is cointegration among the variables, so the null hypothesis is rejected. The Johansen Fisher panel test is used to check whether the variables under study have any association in the long run. The null hypothesis is that there is no cointegration among the variables.

The VAR lag shows how many lags should be taken in the model, and in order to select the lag-length, AIC, SIC, and HQ are used as criteria; in all three cases, lower values are better. All show significance at lag 1 having the lowest value. These criteria show that, for the panel vector error correction model, the lag length should be 1. The equation shows that long-term association is evident among the variables. Public healthcare expenditure has a long-run association with renewable energy sources, a result which is consistent with Buonocore et al. (2016) , which implies that when governments make investments in renewable energy products it helps overcome environmental effects which reduces the stress on public health expenditure. In contrast, air pollution puts a significant burden on the economic cost for people, by increasing their healthcare expenditure and decreasing labor productivity. Renewable energy improves health conditions and promotes savings. In addition, the results show that the lag value of CO 2 has a positive association with public health expenditure. This means that an increase in air pollutants causes a rise in diseases, which requires more healthcare attention, and therefore, a polluted environment requires an increase in healthcare expenditure. Our results are consistent with Khoshnevis Yazdi and Khanalizadeh (2017) that an increase in gas emissions causes a rise in healthcare expenditure. The air pollutant NOx is significantly positively related to CO 2 . This means that they are complementary to each other (anything that produces CO 2 also produces a considerable amount of NOx). Moreover, education is positively and significantly related to renewable energy consumption. As the education of people increases, they gain awareness of the environment and prefer to use renewable energy resources to reduce pollution (\u00d6z\u00e7i\u00e7ek and A\u011fpak 2017) . Table 6 shows the outcome of the panel FMOLS. The values of adjusted R and R squared are 89.31 and 90.01, respectively. This shows that nearly 89% of the deviation in public healthcare expenditure of OECD economies is described by the explanatory variables. GDP as proxy of economic growth is significantly positively connected to public healthcare spending of OECD economies, which is supported by G\u00f6vdeli (2019) . This shows that economic activity in advanced economies leads to a rise in public healthcare spending, as a response to increasing health issues associated with toxic air pollutants caused by industry. However, we see that increasing education can help reduce public health expenditure, which is interpreted as the more educated the people in a society are, the more they will be conscious about their health (Li et al. 2019; Kais and Sami 2016) . Furthermore, it is evident that air pollutants such as NOx and carbon emissions (CO 2 ) have a significant influence on the public healthcare spending of OECD economies. Finally, renewable energy and healthcare spending are significantly related, because the use of renewable energy improves the environment and reduces toxic pollution in the air, which causes less damage to the health of people. These results are supported by Apergis et al. (2018a, b) , who prove that healthcare and renewable energy have a unidirectional relationship.",

There is limited literature available related to air pollution, healthcare spending and economic growth in these countries. We also consider renewable energy, and its effect on healthcare expenditure and economic growth. This study uses annual data from 2002 to 2018, and employs panel FMOLS and VECM. Firstly, the panel unit root test for individual variables is employed to check for stationarity. Secondly, the panel cointegration test is employed to find the associations among the variables under study, followed by the panel VECM, which is applied to check for long-run associations between the variables, and the results show that there are such associations. Renewable energy has a significant long-run relationship with healthcare expenditure, which signifies that air pollution deteriorates health. To reduce the damage to health, the only solution is to replace conventional energy sources with renewable sources. Lastly, using panel FMOLS, we check how the dependent and independent variables are related. It is shown that healthcare spending and air pollutants (CO 2 ) are significantly and positively related, which indicates that air pollution adversely affects the health sector. The study concludes that renewable energy is a solution to problems associated with health expenses, which can be achieved by improving the environmental conditions for health and promoting labor productivity. The results show that investment in renewable energy resources leads to environmental sustainability, reduces the use of conventional energy sources, and promotes health and other noneconomic factors like education.",

Governments should play a role in this regard by compelling stakeholders to use less polluting energy resources. This can be done by imposing taxes on air polluting firms, which would eventually reduce air pollution in the environment and reduce healthcare expenditure. The findings of this study provide direction for policy makers, showing how pollution reducing policies improve economic growth by improving the health of people by reducing air pollution-related diseases.",
