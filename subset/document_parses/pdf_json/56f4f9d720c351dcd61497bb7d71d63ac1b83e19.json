            "text": "Background: Pneumonia with severe respiratory failure represents the principal cause of death in COVID-19, where hyper-inflammation plays an important role in lung damage. An effective treatment aiming at reducing the inflammation without preventing virus clearance is thus urgently needed. Tocilizumab, an anti-soluble IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody, has been proposed for treatment of patients with COVID-19. Methods: A retrospective cohort study at the Montichiari Hospital, Brescia, Italy, was conducted. We included consecutive patients with COVID-19 related pneumonia at the early stage of respiratory failure, all treated with a standard protocol (hydroxychloroquine 400 mg daily, lopinavir 800 mg plus ritonavir 200 mg per day). We compared survival rate and clinical status in a cohort of patients who received additional treatment with tocilizumab once (either 400 mg intravenous or 324 mg subcutaneous) with a retrospective cohort of patients who did not receive tocilizumab (referred to as the standard treatment group). All outcomes were assessed at the end of the follow-up, that correspond to death or complete recovery and discharge from the hospital. Findings: 158 patients were included, 90 of which received tocilizumab. 34 out of 68 (50%) patients in the standard treatment group and 7 out of 90 (7.7%) in the tocilizumab group died. Tocilizumab significantly improved survival compared to standard care (multivariate HR: 0.057; 95% C.I = 0.017-0.187, p < 0.001). No differences between the two administration routes of tocilizumab were observed. No tocilizumab-related infections and/or side effects were observed. Interpretation: Early treatment with tocilizumab could be helpful to prevent excessive hyper-inflammation and death in COVID-19 related pneumonia. Low dose administration of tocilizumab is not associated with adverse events. Funding: none",

During this state of immunological hyper-activation, peripheral CD4 and CD8 T cells counts were substantially reduced while their status was hyper-activated. Furthermore, an increased concentration of highly pro-inflammatory CCR6+ T helper 17 (Th17) in CD4 T cells and a high concentration of cytotoxic granules in CD8 lymphocytes in peripheral blood was found in dead patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 [3] . Importantly, as shown by previous literature, increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin \u00c0IL-1B, IL-6, IL-12) and chemokines (CXCL10 and CCL2) are associated with pulmonary inflammation and extensive lung involvement in SARS patients [4, 5] .

            "text": "Within the pro-inflammatory cytokines, Interleukin 6 (IL-6) plays a key role in the pathogenesis of the COVID-19 related cytokine storm [2] . IL-6 seems to be also responsible for the activation of T helper 17 (Th17) cells in the dendritic cell-T cell interaction [6] . In COVID-19 affected patients, a high Th17 cells activation could result from a virus-driven increased production of IL-6 by the immune system [2] . Several studies showed that the serum levels of IL-6 are increased in COVID-19 patients and that its circulating levels are positively related to disease severity [7\u00c09] . Indeed, levels of IL-6 have been found to be directly associated with severe lung damage [10, 11] , and a recent meta-analysis of six studies investigating IL-6 concentration in COVID-19 demonstrated 2.9 fold higher levels in patients with complicated COVID-19 compared with patients with non-complicated disease [12] . An excessive and dysregulated production of IL-6 is thus considered a potential negative prognostic factor for survival during COVID-19, being higher levels of IL-6 related to a higher mortality rate [10] . For this reason, high serum IL-6 levels were suggested to be a reliable biomarker of COVID-19 progression [13\u00c015] . The role of hyper-inflammation in COVID-19 is so important that guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infected pneumonia recommended cytokine monitoring to reduce mortality [14, 15] .",

While some studies describing the clinical and radiological improvement of patients with severe clinical conditions due to COVID-19 related pneumonia treated with high dose of tocilizumab reported an increased survival [19] , other studies failed to observe beneficial effect of tocilizumab in severe patients [20, 21] .

Number denotes mean (standard deviation) (a); raw number (percentages) (b); median [interquartile range] (c). Statistical significance was evaluated using two independent sample t-test (a); chi square (b); Mann-Whitney U test (c). P value reports the associated p value (statistical significance p<0.05). CRP = C-Reactive Protein; bpm = beats per minute. [5] . Although the viral invasion and the direct cytopathic effect are critical for a worsening of the clinical course, there is evidence that a deranged immune response can be implicated in ARDS [3] . A significant increase of white blood cells, in particular of neutrophils, has been observed in patients with a severe disease, while a significant reduction of both CD8+ and CD4+ T lymphocytes cells was detected [38] . Among of immunologic biomarkers, the highest levels of IL-6 and serum ferritin were observed in severe subacute form of respiratory disease and in non-survivors COVID-19 patients [9] ; in the same way, inflammatory cytokines as IL-2 and IFN-g show an high serum levels in patient with severe course of SARS and MERS [5, 39] . As cytokine storm has been proposed to have a pivotal role in organ injury in COVID-19, tocilizumab has been suggested as a possible treatment in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Indeed, anti-IL6 therapeutic strategy has been shown to be effective in cytokine response syndrome (CRS) [40] . A recommended protocol for tocilizumab used in COVID-19 [41] , requires a first dose of 4-8 mg/kg and an additional infusion after 12 hours for patients with worsening or poor clinical response. This protocol, however, lead to inconsistent results. Previous literature indeed report small or absent [20, 21] effect of tocilizumab in a very small cohort of patients, making the results statistically unreliable. Additional studies provide data of single arm of patients only (i.e. the control group was not available) [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] , making the real efficacy of tocilizumab obscure. In the absence of specific treatment for COVID-19, the main objective of clinicians should be to promote virus clearance allowing immune system to over-ride viral infection, whereas preventing organ damage due to excessive inflammation. In this regard, early tocilizumab administration was expected to be useful to modulate the cytokine storm and prevent the consolidation of lung damage, while the low dose was expected to be useful to reduce hyper inflammation without abolishing the immune response to the virus [24] . In the current study, a single low dose of tocilizumab (400 mg e.v. or 324 mg s.c., regardless of the patients' weight) has been administered at the early stage of the respiratory failure. Our study shows a higher survival rate in the treated group compared to the patients who were treated with standard therapy only with a 94% treatment impact on the risk of death, fully supporting the efficacy of administration of low dose of tocilizumab early in the disease course. In accordance with previous data [47] , the current study also supports that older age is a risk factor for death and that the probability to die increases by 6% for each year of age. Several reports also suggested that concomitant chronic illness may have an impact on mortality rate [1, 48] . The current results confirmed diabetes and cardiopathy as risk factors for worse outcome Indeed, patients with diabetes have a 3.2 fold higher risk of death compared to patients without diabetes, and patients with cardiopathy have a 3 fold higher risk of death compared to patients without cardiopathy [49, 50] . In our cohort hypertension is not associated with an increased risk of death but this could depend on the sample size. The favorable outcome in the tocilizumab cohort is independent from administration routes, as the survival rates and the respiratory recovery are similar between patients receiving 400 mg i.v. and patients receiving 324 mg s.c. The higher number of deaths observed in the latter (6 deaths vs 1) is easily justified by the older average age in the subcutaneously treated group compared to the intravenous one. The equivalence between the two administration routes is further supported by the the similar hospitalization time and by the equally rapid pharmacological effect, as evidenced by the quick decrease in CRP and body temperature analysis in both groups, in accordance with previous studies [51] . These data confirm the pharmacodynamic equivalence studies that analyzed the impact of tocilizumab administration route and confirm what has already been found in the rheumatological field [28, 52] . Despite the similar effect of the two administration routes on tocilizumab efficacy, the current data also provide preliminary support that the potential hepatotoxicity might be dose dependent, being the observed increment in ALT higher in patients receiving 400 mg compared to patients receiving 324 mg. This elevation in ALT is known and expected during tocilizumab therapy, is not associated with clinically relevant increases in direct bilirubin and is not associated with clinical evidence of hepatic insufficiency. Importantly, the PIL clearly indicate that this elevation did not result in permanent or clinically evident hepatic injury in clinical trials [37] .",

            "text": "This study presented some limitations. The most important one refers to the lack of randomization resulting in not matched groups. Indeed, patients treated with standard care were older and with higher prevalence of comorbidities compared to patients treated with tocilizumab. Contrarily, patients treated with tocilizumab were admitted to the hospital later during the disease course, as supported by the longer time elapsed from symptoms onset to hospitalization. Despite we are confident that the multivariate approach applied in the current paper (Cox proportional hazard model) removed the potential biasing effect of these unmatched variables on the primary results, the current data need to be further supported. A second important limitation is that an additional control group, including patients treated with tocilizumab during the late stage of respiratory failure is missing. This unfortunately prevents us for claiming that early administration of tocilizumab is more effective than late administration. However, it is worth noting that previous literature provides discordant and thus inconclusive findings on tocilizumab effectiveness in severe COVID-19 [20, 21] , thus suggesting that its late administration, when lung damage already happened, might be less effective in reducing mortality. Finally, the patient's inclusion strategy applied does not allow to definitely rule out the potential impact of unmeasured and unconscious confounding factors on the results, as for instance the acquired clinical experience of managing the disease. It is here important to underline that the patients included timely received the needed respiratory support and the standard therapy as for protocol at our site. Furthermore, none of the included patients received anticoagulant therapy modulating the thromboembolic risk [55] . We are thus confident that no relevant confounding factors explaining such an important decrement in mortality rate were present. Despite the number of patients included is quite limited, to our knowledge this represents the biggest study comparing patients receiving tocilizumab with a control group receiving standard therapy only. However, in line with our rationale, only patients in the early stage of respiratory failure were enrolled. The current results cannot thus be generalizable to the wider population of COVID-19 patients, as for instance patients in critical conditions, where tocilizumab beneficial effect seems to be more limited.",
