In the United States, one of the first recommendations regarding masking came from the Surgeon General in February of 2020, who urged Americans to avoid purchasing masks, out of fear of shortages for healthcare providers [2] . This was followed in April 2020 by recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to wear cloth face covers in public areas [3] . Since then, there has been a plethora of evidence describing the benefit of mask use in curbing the spread of COVID-19 [4] .",

For example, individuals experiencing homelessness were found to have 1.3x higher case fatality rate than the general population [8] . The emergency department (ED) is considered society's \"safety net\" [9] , and is often the only point of health care access for many marginalized populations [10] . Other surveys have shown that negative attitudes toward masks, and mask mandates, persist [11] . As demonstrated in previous work on vaccine hesitancy [12] , online and phone recruitment survey methods may fail to sample a number of vulnerable populations who are at high risk of complications from COVID-19, such as the unhoused, those experiencing financial hardship and minoritized populations [5] .",

Our study adds to these data due to the unique population studied, patients in safety-net EDs. As such we were able to note that individuals experiencing homelessness were significantly less likely to wear masks most of the time than those who are housed. This potentially points to an unmet need amongst this population to provide education and supplies. With businesses such as coffeehouses closed, it is possible that access to electrical outlets was limited, making it difficult to charge mobile phones and other devices, and thus essential information regarding social distancing and protective measures may not have been easily transmitted to this group [17] . Mask wearing may have also been limited by inabilities to keep masks clean and dry or limited access to masks at food banks and shelters, especially early in the pandemic [18] .",

Because this data is self-reported, social desirability bias may have influenced respondents to answer in ways they thought may please survey administrators, even if not representative of their true behavior. Spectrum bias limits the generalizability of our findings: all sites were in urban areas affiliated with academic medical institutions, and we could only survey people who presented to EDs, thus excluding patients in rural areas, where mask use is known to be less prevalent [21, 22] , and those who may have greater mistrust of health care systems. We did not separately assess race and ethnicity (S1 File and S1 Table) and thus it is possible that we did not accurately capture these demographics, especially for Latinx individuals. Nuances of mask use, such as correct positioning, were not assessed, and thus our results may overestimate effective mask wearing.

Educating patients about the benefits of masks and providing masks to those who do not have enough should become part of provider care in the ED-perhaps as a standard component of triage or discharge.
