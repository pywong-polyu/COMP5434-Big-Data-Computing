Regarding HPV-related cancers, Puerto Rico has the highest incidence rate of cervical cancer among all the states and territories of the United States (2). Despite the lower prevalence of anal cancer in Puerto Rico, men who have sex with men (MSM), people living with HIV, and women with HPVrelated gynecological cancers are at higher risk of developing this malignancy (1,2). Moreover, the incidence of penile cancer is twice as high, and the mortality rate is 3 times as high among Puerto Rican men compared with men from other racial and ethnic groups in the US (3).",

These efforts from multiple sectors (eg, coalitions, government agencies, health providers, scientists) led Puerto Rico to have among the highest HPV initiation rates since 2014. These sectors have been pioneers in developing policies that support HPV vaccination access in Puerto Rico. Among the more meaningful is Law No. 9 (passed December 20, 2010), which provided HPV vaccine access to girls aged 11 to 18 years. The law was amended in 2012 to also include boys aged 11 to 18 years (4). Implementation of this public policy was essential because the Vaccine for Children Program, which is available for Puerto Rican families with no health insurance, provides limited access to the vaccine for children from families with private insurance. In 2015, after the implementation of this law, the Vaccination Coalition of Puerto Rico (VOCES, by its acronym in Spanish) led the first discussion about having an HPV vaccine requirement for school entrance, as part of the HPV Advisory Panel report (5) .",

The epidemiologic impact of the disease was considered before the policy's adoption, as were the high HPV vaccine initiation rates. In 2016, according to the National Immunization Survey-Teen, rates before the implementation of the requirement were 80.8% in girls and 71.1% in boys with 1 or more HPV vaccine doses (6) .

The principal barriers identified were misinformation about the HPV vaccine and lack of knowledge about the implementation process of the mandate. In contrast, people's principal concern against the policy was the government's excessive interference in deciding what was best for their children. During this activity, the key informants' recommendations were to 1) inform parents about the pros and cons of the vaccine; 2) actively use social media as a channel for dissemination of reliable information, acknowledging how this media is also used to spread misinformation; 3) train school staff; and 4) identify a central-figure school staff member who can follow up on the completion of doses and guide the parents. Additional findings indicated parental hesitancy, lack of awareness about the HPV vaccine and the new school-entry vaccination requirement, and unfounded concerns about the potential side effects of the HPV vaccine (7).",

Nevertheless, several challenges are worth discussing. First, HPV vaccine implementation was 11 months after Hurricane Maria, one of the worst natural disasters in Puerto Rican history. The impact of this hurricane on the school and public health systems led to an estimated 2.43% population migration to the continental US in 2017 (approximately 77,000 people) (8) . This migration dynamic should be PREVENTING CHRONIC DISEASE carefully explored when calculating immunization rates using data from PRIR. Also, the impact of social media on hesitancy to use the HPV vaccine is worth documenting. Negative sentiments toward the vaccine may affect people's intention to vaccinate, thus limiting improvements in vaccination rates (9) . Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the public health agenda, prioritizing efforts on mitigating this infection and implementing a sound COVID-19 vaccine distribution plan island wide. As expected, an impending and long-term challenge will be the impact COVID-19 has on adolescents' vaccination use, as declines in doctor's visits have been documented (10).",

This implementation also encourages the strengthening of partnerships between local communities and policy makers to create additional strategies to support this requirement and address challenges. Educational programs about HPV vaccination must be disseminated to reduce public skepticism and clarify misinformation among hesitant parents. Furthermore, epidemiologic studies should be developed to assess the impact of changes in HPV vaccination rates on future incidence of HPV-related precancers and cancers in Puerto Rico, with the potential to document the progress toward eliminating cervical cancer on the island.",
