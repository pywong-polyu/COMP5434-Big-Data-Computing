            "text": "As the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic proceeds, neurocognitive long-term consequences are frequently observed (1): follow-up investigations of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients 2-4 mo after symptom onset report, among others, impaired memory (20%-34%) (2, 3) , disturbed concentration (20%-40%) (2, 3) , and cognitive problems (36%) (4) . These cognitive deficits in the chronic stage are now frequently referred to as long COVID-19 or as post-COVID-19 syndrome. Recently, we described impairment of frontoparietal cognitive functions accompanied by frontoparietally dominant cortical hypometabolism on 18 F-FDG PET (as an established marker of neuronal function) in a relevant subset of subacute COVID-19 patients initially requiring inpatient treatment for nonneurologic complications (5) . By comparing the 18 F-FDG PET scans of those subacute COVID-19 inpatients with a control sample using voxelwise principal-components analysis, we established a COVID-19-related spatial covariance pattern, the expression of which tightly correlated with performance in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) (6) . Frontal and, to a lesser extent, temporoparietal cortical hypometabolism, which improved during follow-up at 1 and 6 mo, was also confirmed as a major finding in the acute phase of COVID-19-related encephalopathy by a recent study of Kas et al. (7) . Deviating from the aforementioned results, Guedj et al. (8) reported a profile of hypometabolism in limbic or paralimbic regions extending to the brain stem and cerebellum in patients with long COVID-19 examined at about 3 mo after symptom onset. Against this background, we investigated whether the frontoparietal hypometabolism might be a biologic fingerprint of post-COVID-19 syndrome neurocognitive impairments. We reassessed 18 F-FDG PET and MoCA performance in 8 patients presenting for follow-up during the chronic stage approximately 6 mo after symptom onset.",

The topographic profile rating algorithm (10) of the ScAnVP software (The Fenstein Institute for Medical Research) was used to derive each individual's pattern expression score (PES) for the previously established COVID-19-related spatial covariance pattern Qualitative data are number and percentage; continuous data are mean, SD, and range. (5) . For additional conventional analysis, a paired t test between the 18 F-FDG PET scans at the subacute and chronic stages was performed after proportional scaling of individual voxelwise 18 F-FDG uptake to white matter (given the obvious involvement of gray matter shown in the previous study (5)). Voxelwise 2-sample t testing was also applied to the 18 F-FDG PET scans of COVID-19 patients at the chronic stage compared with the control cohort (n 5 45 agematched control patients in whom a somatic central nervous system disease was carefully excluded (5)) in order to explore whether hypometabolism still remains at the chronic stage of disease. All processing steps were implemented with an in-house pipeline in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc.) and Statistical Parametric Mapping, version 12 (SPM12), software (www.fil.ion.ac.uk/spm).",

MoCA performance significantly improved over time from a mean (6SD) global score of 19.1 6 4.5 (maximum, 30 points) at the subacute stage to 23.4 6 3.6 at the chronic stage (d 5 0.97, P 5 0.03; Table 1 )-a score that is, however, still below the frequently used cutoff for detection of cognitive impairment (,26/30). Five of 8 patients still were below this threshold (6) . MoCA domain scores showed that orientation and attention were almost unimpaired at the chronic stage but revealed persistent deficits in visuoconstructive and executive functions and, especially, memory ( Table 1) . As previously shown (5), the PES for the COVID-19-related pattern (Fig. 1A) in the patients with subacute COVID-19 was significantly higher than that in the control cohort (44.3 vs. 211.3; d 5 1.84, P 5 6 3 10 26 ). COVID-19 patients had a significantly lower mean PES at the chronic than at the subacute stage (6.8 6 32.6 vs. 44.3 6 33.1; d 5 1.06, P 5 0.002) although still, at trend level, higher than in the control cohort (6.8 vs. 211.3; d 5 0.60, P 5 0.06) (Fig. 1B) . Exploratory correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between cognitive assessment (MoCA global score adjusted for years of education) and PET (R 2 5 0.39, P 5 0.01; i.e., a lower PES was associated with better cognitive performance) over the subacute and chronic stages (Fig. 1C) . Moreover, changes in cognition (MoCA) seem to be associated with changes in PES but failed to attain statistical significance in the present small sample (r 5 20.54, P 5 0.16, n 5 8).

The expression of the previously established COVID-19-related spatial covariance pattern at the chronic stage was significantly reduced compared with what it was at the subacute stage. However, in comparison to a control cohort, chronic COVID-19 patients still exhibited a slightly higher pattern expression (at trend level) and residual hypometabolism indicating a shift toward normal levels, but no definite return. Although we observed a significant improvement in the cognitive screening test (MoCA), the average performance was still within the range of mild cognitive impairment (6).

            "text": "Recent neuropathologic examinations of patients whose death from COVID-19 was due to nonneurologic causes shed light on potential pathophysiologic mechanisms underlying the sustained cortical hypometabolism and impairment (12): SARS-CoV-2 RNA or proteins could be detected in 53% of patients, with a predominance for the caudal brain stem and cranial nerve, highlighting the known neuroinvasive propensity of human b-coronavirus clades (13, 14) . However, major histopathologic findings were astrogliosis, microglial activation, and mild infiltration by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, with an emphasis on brain stem and cerebellum (12) , that were unrelated to the presence of SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, these changes are more likely caused by a systemic inflammatory response or cytokine release (15) . Because the cortical gray matter is largely spared from damage and inflammatory changes (5, 12) , the reduced glucose metabolism is likely secondary; for example, it may be a consequence of a functional decoupling from aminergic brain stem nuclei (16, 17) . This inflammation-triggered process could have outlasted the acute infection and only partly recovered over the contemplated period of 6 mo. Of note, changes in cognition (MoCA) seem to be associated with changes in PES, although this observation failed to attain statistical significance (r 5 20.54, P 5 0.16). We did not observe an association between changes in PES and MoCA on the one hand and time to follow-up examinations on the other. This lack of association may also be due to the limited number of subjects and the relatively narrow and late time range of follow-up examinations. Still, the regions with residual hypometabolism are those with the most prominent decreases during the acute stage and may thus take longer to fully recover. Consequently, the slow reversibility of post-COVID-19 cerebral hypometabolism and cognitive impairment described in the present study would be in accordance with a lasting perturbation of cortical function caused by a subcortical periinflammatory process as a correlate of the post-COVID-19 syndrome.",

(8) reported a cohort of patients examined at highly variable time points (about 1-5 mo after COVID-19; on average, 96 6 31 d). Given the apparent time dependency of cognitive and metabolic changes, such pooling of patients at presumably different stages precludes a comparison to studies of selected time points such as ours. Moreover, given the obvious alterations in cortical metabolism observed in our cohort and the study by Kas et al. (7) , the use of cortical regions for count rate normalization of PET data appears problematic. In fact, this is why we selected an approach (i.e., principal-components analysis) that does not require an a priori definition of a reference region. Such factors (among others) (B) Graph showing that PES for COVID-19-related spatial covariance pattern is lower at chronic stage than at subacute stage but is still, at trend level, higher than in control cohort.

(7) and our study. In turn, our study and that of Kas are in good agreement with each other, showing a slow, though not (yet) complete recovery of cortical metabolism over 6 mo. Still, a detailed comparison of these 2 studies is complicated by the initial inclusion criteria: patients were prospectively enrolled in our cohort when presenting with at least 1 new neurologic symptom and underwent 18 F-FDG PET for further diagnostic work-up if at least 2 new symptoms were present (5). Kas et al. (7) reported the analysis of 18 F-FDG PET scans in 7 patients who had COVID-19-related encephalopathy with new-onset cognitive impairment. Moreover, initial disease severity was different in the 2 studies (i.e., 3/7, or 43%, of patients reported by Kas et al. (7) needed mechanical ventilation, as opposed to 2/8, or 25%, in the present study). Finally, Kas et al. (7) also conducted an assessment by a comprehensive cognitive test battery, but no direct association to PET data was reported.",

However, this selection bias is inherently linked to the present study's major finding of slow but evident recovery of cognitive impairment.
