            "text": "With a limited supply of organ donors and available organs for transplantation, the aim of tissue engineering with three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology is to construct fully functional and viable tissue and organ replacements for various clinical applications. 3D bioprinting allows for the customization of complex tissue architecture with numerous combinations of materials and printing methods to build different tissue types, and eventually fully functional replacement organs. The main challenge of maintaining 3D printed tissue viability is the inclusion of complex vascular networks for nutrient transport and waste disposal. Rapid development and discoveries in recent years have taken huge strides toward perfecting the incorporation of vascular networks in 3D printed tissue and organs. In this review, we will discuss the latest advancements in fabricating vascularized tissue and organs including novel strategies and materials, and their applications. Our discussion will begin with the exploration of printing vasculature, progress through the current statuses of bioprinting tissue/organoids from bone to muscles to organs, and conclude with relevant applications for in vitro models and drug testing. We will also explore and discuss the current limitations of vascularized tissue engineering and some of the promising future directions this technology may bring.",

            "text": "Not only are organ donors a limited resource, the functional efficacy of donated organs as well as risk of disease and/or infection (a prominent issue during the COVID-19 pandemic) from deceased individuals greatly limit the number of available tissues for transplantation (Neuberger and Callaghan, 2020; Shah et al., 2020) . Living donors, although providing another small pool of organs or partial organs, still do not keep up with the current demand (Lee et al., 2019c) . Thus, ongoing active research has pursued alternative methods of obtaining functional tissues for implantation (Cui et al., 2017) . In response to the demand outpacing the availability and with our expanding knowledge of cellular biology, the progress of employing tissue engineering research and its medical applications has come a long way in the past decades . Specifically, the incorporation of three-dimensional (3D) bioprinting technology in the field of regenerative medicine has created new possibilities for patient-specific Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org 2 May 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 664188 tissue regeneration therapy ( Figure 1A ; Mandrycky et al., 2016; Ka\u010darevi\u0107 et al., 2018) . 3D bioprinting or additive manufacture allows for the precise layer-by-layer construction of different complex cell models and tissue types with high precision, repeatability, and reproducibility (Li et al., 2016; Bishop et al., 2017; Ka\u010darevi\u0107 et al., 2018) . 3D bioprinting technology has the ability to control the external shape and the internal geometry, spatial distributions, and cellular orientation of generated tissues to recapitulate the structure and function of their native counterparts (Lee and Yeong, 2016; Zhu et al., 2016; Bishop et al., 2017; Murphy et al., 2020) . Numerous printing methods have been explored and implemented for the fabrication of various tissue architectures including: extrusion bioprinting, inkjet bioprinting, laser assisted bioprinting, dual head printing, and light-mediated stereolithography (Figures 1B-E ; Mandrycky et al., 2016; Derakhshanfar et al., 2018) . The choice of \"bioinks\" and/or scaffolds for 3D bioprinting also determines tissue integrity, interconnectivity of different components within the organ, and temporal release of growth factors and bioactive substances for proper tissue development or repair (Zhu et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017; Gungor-Ozkerim et al., 2018) . By incorporating developmental biology, cell biology, regenerative medicine, and bioengineering and specifically tissue engineering, 3D bioprinting provides a platform for artificially constructing accurate tissue mimics for patient implantation and drug testing (Bishop et al., 2017) . Figure 1A shows a summary illustration on how to harvest cells for bioprinting and also what type of printers is commonly employed at this time.",

This section will be followed by an examination of some of the exciting current advances in the most researched areas of bioprinting: bone, muscle, cardiac, liver, and skin and discuss attempts to implant these engineered tissues in vivo. We have chosen this order so that we begin with the vasculature and then move our discussion of recent attempts to make bone replacements and the need for vascular conduits to provide nutrients and to remove waste from the printed bones. Since bioprinted bone has now reached the level of in vivo implantation, the ability for this material to incorporate with the native bone and surrounding tissue will be addressed. In the subsequent sections, we will address attempts to design bioprinted replacement organs and the issues of designing and printing a complex multicellular tissue that also requires connection (E) Stereolithography bioprinting uses digital light sources to selectively crosslink bio-inks layer by layer (arrows indicate direction of projected light).

Capillary distance within tissues is 60-300 \u03bcm, and survival rates of cells populating areas above this diffusional distance limit dramatically declines (Krogh, 1919; Kety, 1951; 16; Bainbridge, 2013) . With this caveat, incorporation of vasculature into bioprinted products is critical for the sustained growth and survival of the tissue, and to allow for maintenance of normal physiological viability (Tomasina et al., 2019) . There are currently two main strategies for blood vessel incorporation in bioprinted material. The first of these relies on the controlled release of angiogenic factors that help induce blood vessel growth in 3D printed tissues (Inglis et al., 2016; Park et al., 2019) . This technique has been employed in ongoing active research where the primary goal is patient implantation of the printed material (Inglis et al., 2016; Datta et al., 2017) . The second strategy involves the direct printing of vascular scaffolds (Datta et al., 2017) .",

            "text": "Several methods have been explored and evaluated for bioprinting of blood vessels. These methods generally attempt to mimic a native blood vessel in that they include endothelial cells of the intima, and smooth muscle cells of the media and a structural layer mimicking the adventitia (Mazurek et al., 2017) . The first biosynthetic blood vessel was created by Weinberg and Bell in 1986 (Weinberg and Bell, 1986 ). Weinberg's vessel consisted of smooth muscle cells grown in a collagen gel in an annular mold. This was then covered with a Dacron mesh followed by an outer layer of fibroblasts. The tubular construct was removed from the mandrel and an endothelial layer of cells was added to the inner layer. A limiting factor was the necessity of culturing sufficient autologous endothelial cells for the adventitia (Weinberg and Bell, 1986) . The burst pressure was also found to be insufficient for use in high pressure vessels. This initial advancement, however, gave rise to numerous other studies using other synthetic materials and cultured cells (Chlup\u00e1c et al., 2009) . The stability of the endothelial layer and synthetic biocompatibility has been of some concern for the continued long-term survival of the printed vessel. The first entirely biological vessel construct was completed in 1998 by L'Heureux who grew a sheet of smooth muscle cells which was then wrapped around a tubular support (L'Heureux et al., 1998) . A sheet of fibroblasts was grown and then wrapped over the smooth muscle cells. Finally, the smooth muscle/ fibroblast tube was removed from the mandrel and endothelial cells were grown on the inner wall of the tube (L'Heureux et al., 1998) . The cell culture involved in this multilayer approach took around 8-12 weeks to complete the process. This long timeframe remains a limiting factor for mass production of replacement tissues and also for situations necessitating a rapid deployment in critical applications for patients. This time frame would become even longer if the cells used were harvested directly from the patient that requires a replacement vessel. These initial studies also needed to examine inflammation associated with a multilayer print and the innate immune system that could recognize this as a foreign body. The next step in the history of tissue engineered vascular grafts (TEVG), and other physiological bioprinting applications was the use of absorbable or degradable support scaffolds (Matsuzaki et al., 2019) . Biopolymers, such as polyglycolic acid (PGA), have been used since the early 1970s when they were developed for use as absorbable sutures (Frazza and Schmitt, 1971; Miln et al., 1972; Reed and Gilding, 1981) . Foam polymers such as poly(L-lactic) acid (PLA) and poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic) acid (PLGA) were examined for use as scaffolds for cell transplantation Wald et al., 1993) . Niklason and Langer (1997) grew smooth muscle cell on tubular PGA mesh. A periodic stretch of the SMC-scaffold construct during cell culture helped maintain the smooth muscle physiological characteristics. However, these vessels were unable to withstand normal arterial pressures (Niklason and Langer, 1997) . Mechanical stretching during culture was shown to improve the strength of SMC grown on a collagen-gel scaffold (Seliktar et al., 2000) . Improved culturing conditions resulted in a successful implantation of an engineered vessel in vivo and were accomplished in 1999. A prolonged culture period (8 weeks) is still something to be improved upon to allow for urgent use in trauma situations. Luo et al. (2020) has recently successfully demonstrated the use of Induced pluripotent stem cells (ihPSC) for TEVG using a PGA scaffold.",

Also, in the early attempts in the deployment of 3D bioprinting for this application, it was shown that even after the generation of the print, there is a relatively long time of conditioning the print (in some cases 2-3 months) prior to attempting to deploy the engineered replacement. During the development of these prints, issues associated with longevity and also burst pressures were researched in vitro. With the present technologies, it makes having a patient specific application prepared for emergency use a nonstarter. Some potential suggestions are to create a series of conduits that are generated from stem cells that are devoid of antigen activity that could become universal implants for emergency situations. To create this technology, there is still going to be a time lag for creating the print and also for its storage. This also does not address if it will be possible to have only large conduits or if small and branched conduits can also be created that will have sufficient viability while being stored. Another possible future development could be the use of different printer modalities that may extrude printed material at higher rates, at low or high density, and print using less support material or potentially lower cell densities.",

In extrusion based bioprinting, the cells (generally endothelial and or smooth muscle cells) are suspended in a hydrogel consisting of alginate, fibrin, PEG, and gelatin which serve as a scaffold (Axpe and Oyen, 2016) . After extrusion, the cell-hydrogel mix (bioink) undergoes physical or chemical crosslinking which occurs allowing the gel to maintain the desired printed shape (Skardal et al., 2010; Gungor-Ozkerim et al., 2018; Maina et al., 2020) . Tubular constructs can be printed by extrusion of the hydro-gel in a vertical network of hollow tubules (Li et al., 2009) , printing around a solid mandrel (Maina et al., 2020) or coaxial printing (Zhang et al., 2013a; Datta et al., 2017) . The method described here is referred to as \"direct extrusion. \" The printed construct is directly extruded into the final form in this case a tubule. Alternatively, indirect extrusion can be accomplished by printing Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org the tubular shape using a sacrificial hydrogel which contains no cells and is printed into or on a structural hydrogel (Hinton et al., 2015; Datta et al., 2017) . The sacrificial hydrogel is removed and the remaining network is perfused with media containing vascular cells (Zhang et al., 2013b; Datta et al., 2017; Maina et al., 2020) .",

Traditionally, biomaterials such as calcium phosphate have been used to substitute missing bone . Chen et al. (2018) reported the use of calcium silicate (CS) instead of calcium phosphate for the 3D printing of scaffolds for bone as CS has shown to produce calcified bone-like apatite layers that supersede that of calcium phosphate. They constructed a polydopamine-modified calcium silicate (PDACS)/polycaprolactone (PCL) scaffold in which Wharton's jelly mesenchymal cells (WJMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) used in a combinatory hydrogel that was then incorporated into a single product (Figure 3 ; Chen et al., 2018) . Results from these studies showed that the addition of the PDACS/PCL scaffold into the WJMSCs/HUVECs hydrogel led to higher levels of bone formation proteins and angiogenic biomarkers, suggesting that this approach may be effective for building deep bone structures with complex vascular networks .",

(2019) developed a two-step digital light processing technique that included the use of HUVEC spheroids and octacalcium phosphate (OCP) for printing the complex bone structures (Figure 4 ). This pattern of HUVEC spheroids embedded in gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) in a dual ring structure was designed to mimic the bone marrow space. Results suggest that GelMA concentration modulates the extent of capillary-like structures that originate from HUVEC spheroids, and that 3D bioprinted bone constructs with biomimetic dual ring structures can be potentially used to engineer vascularized bone tissue (Anada et al., 2019) . Meanwhile, Cidonio et al. (2019a) utilized a synthetic nanoclay, laponite (LPN) along with GelMA as their bioink for bone tissue construction. In this study, they incorporated vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the bioink to induce increased angiogenesis after implantation. Results confirm that VEGF-loaded LPN-GelMA constructs in vascular chick embryos demonstrated higher blood vessel penetration than previously used GelMA-VEGF scaffolds (Cidonio et al., 2019b) . Recently, Chiesa et al. (2020) reports the in vitro construction of bone tissue by first seeding a gelatinnanohydroxyapatite (gel-nHA) scaffold with hMSCs for 2 weeks, and then included HUVECs in the macropores of the scaffold to induce angiogenesis ( Figure 5 ). A bone model with a robust vascular network was realized in 4 weeks' time with fully developed vascularization in just 2 weeks. Although VEGF doped bioink can improve vascularization, the question that remains is what occurs when you have an increased systemic exposure to VEGF that has been shown to be carcinogenic (Verheul and Pinedo, 2000; French and Frazier, 2011) .",

First, a framework was fabricated with polydopamine-modified calcium silicate (PDACS)/polycaprolactone (PCL) composite to support the entire mechanical stability. Second, the alginate/gelatin hydrogels encapsulated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) were dispensed into the pores. The Wharton's jelly mesenchymal cells (WJMSC) were printed on the PDASC/PCL scaffold with the piezoelectric needle. The sequential dispensing of PDACS/PCL composite, hydrogel, and cells was repeated and stacked to build the three-dimensional (3D) scaffold (10 layers). Reprinted with permission from Mater. Sci.

LAB allowed the precise bioprinting with cell-level resolution of various patterns of endothelial cells, mesenchymal stem cells, collagen, and VEGF into the bone defect (K\u00e9rour\u00e9dan et al., 2019a) . Their results demonstrated that the LAB technique and the incorporation of VEGF were safe and highly controlled under these conditions (K\u00e9rour\u00e9dan et al., 2019b) . The endothelial cells gave rise to organized microvascular networks of significance at 2 months suggesting that in vivo bioprinting with LAB is an invaluable tool for bone tissue pre-vascularization not only in vitro, but in situ (Figure 7 ; K\u00e9rour\u00e9dan et al., 2019b) .

The construct was then implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient mice (Rukavina et al., 2020) . Not only did new micro-vessels start to develop, the newly formed vessels were stabilized by mouse pericytes, indicating that the pre-vascularized artificial bone tissue can lead to normal bone and vascular development after implantation (Rukavina et al., 2020) .

Efforts have focused on applying growth factors, specifically VEGF, to try and stimulate blood vessel formation on the surface of the print. In some of the cases discussed above, this has been moderately successful, but it still leaves questions as to what will happen systemically if the VEGF escapes into the endogenous blood supply. Applications of any vascular growth agent, and particularly VEGF, there is a distinct possibility that unwanted cell proliferentiaon can occur outside the area of interest. This could be particularly complicating if the bone replacement was due to cancer. The likelihood of additional tumorogenisi occurring locally or remotely is increased.",

Here, we describe one method of constructing vascularized smooth muscle tissue, specifically found in the urinary tract. Jin et al. (2020) used human adipose-derived stem cells in smooth muscle differentiation medium to grow induced microtissues (ID-MTs) which would be used as ink for the fabrication of urinary tract patches. VEGF and a tumor necrosis gene (TSG-6) were expressed in the ID-MTs for blood vessel growth (Jin et al., 2020) . The multilayered bioprinted structure was transplanted into the subcutaneous tissue of nude mice. After just 1 week, vasculature was visualized in the functioning 3D printed smooth muscle construct (Jin et al., 2020) . Their results suggest that ID-MTs can be used along with vasculature-inducing factors for the development of blood vessels in fabricated smooth muscle tissue of the urinary tract (Jin et al., 2020) .

Along with printing the various types of muscle, some tissues such as the heart are a complex collection of various types of muscle. When it becomes possible to get muscle fibers printed then the next steps in the process will be to provide vascular connections so that a multilayer print can receive nutrients and eliminate waste, this is very important to also prevent ischemic injury to the tissues or the buildup of waste products such as lactic acid. After the completion of the very basic physiological needs of the muscle that has been printed the question arises if on this multilayer print there is also a need to go back in and make neuronal connections that will provide the muscle with the appropriate conductive signals to induce activation and also relaxation following neuronal activation. These different issues should be addressed over time and as there has been progress in printing muscle tissue and attempting to use VEGF to induce blood vessel formation 2 of the 3 key aspects for creating bioprinted replacements have been achieved. It remains to be seen once these printed muscles are implanted if the innervation naturally occurs.",

Tissue engineering has offered promising alternatives when healthy cardiac tissue supplies from donors are lacking (Domenech et al., 2016) . 3D printed constructs are viable options for patient implantation to ameliorate the life quality and enhance the prognosis of patients long term survival (Arai et al., 2018) . One of the first scaffold-free pumping cardiac tissues was constructed using spheroids of induced pluripotent stem cells, endothelial cells, and fibroblasts as bioink printed on a needle array (Arai et al., 2018) . Contractile movements and histological analysis of the construct mimicked that of biological cardiac tissue (Arai et al., 2018) . However, this approach cannot produce full organs or large size tissues as no vasculature was included during printing (Arai et al., 2018) . Larger viable cardiac tissue constructs require nutrient transport and waste disposal offered by imbedded blood vessel networks (Jafarkhani et al., 2019) . In 2018, Maiullari et al. (2018) fabricated cardiac tissue in vitro with heterogeneous constructs made up of induced pluripotent cell-derived cardiomyocytes (iPSC-CMs) and HUVECs. They used an innovative approach of encapsulating the cells in hydrogel containing alginate and PEG-Fibrinogen (PF) and performing custom high-resolution spatial printing with a microfluidic printing head (MPH). The successfully bioprinted cardiac tissue product contained vessel-like networks that, through in vivo grafting, showed increased efficacy at supporting the integration of the fabricated product with the host's vasculature (Maiullari et al., 2018) . Skylar-Scott et al. (2019) focused on what they call organ building blocks (OBBs) consisting of patient-specificinduced pluripotent stem cell derived organoids to construct viable cardiac tissue (Figure 9 ). This rapid tissue assembly technique promotes self-healing behavior within damaged host tissue while maintaining high viscoplastic behavior (Skylar-Scott et al., 2019). They embedded perfusable vascular channels via 3D printing which resulted in a perfusable tissue capable of beating synchronously for 7 days while obtaining perfused nutrients through the 3D printed vascular channels (Skylar-Scott et al., 2019) . These results show that this method of bioprinting cardiac tissue can highly mimic heart tissue behavior while maintaining compatibility with pre-printed vasculature (Skylar-Scott et al., 2019) .",

Presently, there has been some good progress to design valves that appear to have the same physiological properties as the original. If these were to be used, then they need to be affixed into the print which will require a vertical print where the complex muscles and vasculature are functional and then the valves need to be positioned in the lower portion of the print and then it would require that the second half of the chamber be developed above the seated valve. Due to the complexity of a multi-day multi-time print, it may be easier to print the two series of chambers and grow them in culture so that they remain viable while the valves are being printed. Once the various sections are assembled, it would be important to try some form of glue, either a surgical cyanoacrylic or a fibronectin-based glue. One issue with cyanoacrylic is that it typically gets hard and less flexible when exposed to higher levels of CO 2 and or HCO 3 which are abundant in tissues. Fibronectin based glues maybe a better alternative except the curing times are typically longer so that it may require multistage gluing; first, having valves attached to the distal part that would then be followed by having the proximal section of the print attached to the distal section containing the glued valves. An alternative idea is to use surgical sutures to attach the valves into position which can be done, as is commonly performed when porcine valves are placed in human tissues to replace a failing endogenous valve.",

Cleary, one way to address the vascularization issue is what researchers in the above section have deployed, namely the use of VEGF to cause vessel formation from an endogenous source; however, this becomes more complex in the liver since there is such a large amount of native blood supply passing through the tissue in a given time that would mean that the VEGF may escape the tissue of interest and lead to potential tumorigenesis occurring at remote locations. Also, it will be important to address the large volumes of blood passing through the printed liver that could lead to leakage in and around the tissue that could lead to death. The main components of the system consist of 260 \u03bcm diameter nozzles, driven by up to eight independently dispensing systems connected to a print-head with an XYZ movement system, in addition to the 3D wound scanner. All components are mounted on a frame small enough to be mobile in the operating room. (C) Skin bioprinting concept. Wounds are first scanned to obtain precise information on wound topography, which then guides the print-heads to deposit specified materials and cell types in appropriate locations (Images courtesy of LabTV -National Defense Education Program, Washington, DC, United States). (D) Example of skin bioprinting process, where markers that are placed around the wound area used as reference points (a) prior to scanning with a hand-held ZScanner\u2122 Z700 scanner (b). Geometric information obtained via scanning is then input in the form of an STL file to orient the scanned images to standard coordinate system (c). The scanned data with its coordinate system is used to generate the fill volume and the path points for nozzle head to travel to print the fill volume (d). Output code is then provided to the custom bioprinter control interface for generation of nozzle path needed to print fill volume (e,f). Reprinted with permission from Sci. Rep.

            "text": "Cost-efficient treatment of chronic, non-healing wounds is becoming increasingly important (Sen et al., 2009 ). In the United States, common types of chronic wounds include: venous ulcers, pressure ulcers, burn wounds, and diabetic wounds that affect over 7 million people each year with an annual cost of $25 billion (Sen et al., 2009) . Split thickness autografts represent the present gold-standard of treatment, but they are limited by the availability of healthy donor skin (Jones et al., 2002) . Allografts, on the other hand, are often associated with a strong inflammatory immune response against donor cells leading to a rejection of the graft (Morrow, 2004; Benichou et al., 2011) . Dermal substitutes with or without cells can be costly to produce and have been shown to result in sub-optimal cosmetic outcomes (Albanna et al., 2019) . Cellular therapy with epidermal keratinocytes and dermal fibroblasts derived from healthy skin utilize seeding or spraying methods that currently lack the high precision of delivery needed to generate complex skin structures (Albanna et al., 2019) . In contrast, 3D bioprinting technology can deliver cells layer-by-layer to target sites with great accuracy (Murphy and Atala, 2014) . The most commonly used type of printers for biological applications are inkjet printers in which droplets of solutions are dispensed onto a substrate from a cartridge that can contain a variety of materials, including cells (Cui et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013) . Recently, Albanna et al. (2019) conducted a proof-of-concept study of a mobile in situ skin bioprinting system with integrated imaging technology to provide rapid on-site management of full-thickness wounds (Figure 10 ; Albanna et al., 2019) . Primary endpoints were defined as improved wound closure, re-epithelialization, and contraction, while a secondary endpoint was defined as healthy, mature skin formation as determined by histology (Albanna et al., 2019) . In this study, they demonstrated the capabilities of their bioprinting system to deliver appropriate cell types and concentrations, by printing a bilayered skin construct consisting of human fibroblasts and keratinocytes directly onto a full-thickness skin defect on a nude mouse model (Albanna et al., 2019) . Mice were divided into three groups of 12 animals each that consisted of no treatment, a printed group that received matrix only (solution of fibrinogen and collagen), and a cell-printed group that received a layer of human fibroblasts overlaid by another layer of keratinocytes (Albanna et al., 2019) . All three groups of wounds were covered with triple antibiotic ointment followed by sterile gauze and surgical tape (Albanna et al., 2019) . Evaluation of the wound area in mice over a 6-week period showed rapid closure of the wound in the cell-printed group compared to the control groups of bioprinted matrix and no treatment (Albanna et al., 2019) . Overall, printed skin cells were able to close the entire wound by 3 weeks post-surgery compared to 5 weeks for both negative controls (Albanna et al., 2019 ). Subsequently, they tested the capabilities of the system by delivering allogeneic or autologous dermal fibroblasts and epidermal keratinocytes within a biological hydrogel to a large full-thickness wound in a porcine model and compared the results to bioprinted matrix only and untreated controls over 8 weeks (Albanna et al., 2019) . The in situ bioprinting of autologous cells resulted in more rapid epithelialization and wound closure as well as reduction in wound contraction at the end of the study period compared to other groups. Pathologic examination correlated with gross appearance of the wounds and confirmed the viability of a bioprinted repair (Albanna et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "One of the limitations in 3D bioprinting skin constructs is generating blood vessels in physiologically similar dimensions to the capillaries found in the skin microvasculature (Baltazar et al., 2020) . The lowest diameter reported of a 3D bioprinted perfused vessel in a skin construct was 80 \u03bcm, compared to the physiologic measurement of <26 \u03bcm at the superficial horizontal plexus and <50 \u03bcm at the dermal-subcutaneous plexus (Braverman and Keh-Yen, 1981; Braverman and Sibley, 1990; Abaci et al., 2016) . In a recent study, Baltazar et al. (2020) developed a work around for this limitation by promoting vascular self-assembly in their bilayered skin constructs that were morphologically and biologically similar to human skin. First, the vascularized dermal compartment was bioprinted with human foreskin dermal fibroblasts, human endothelial cells derived from cord blood human endothelial colony-forming cells, and human placental pericytes suspended in rat tail type I collagen (Baltazar et al., 2020) . This layer was then cultured in Lonza EGM-2 endothelial cell growth medium for 4 days to promote vascular self-assembly. Second, the epidermal compartment containing keratinocytes was bioprinted on day 4 and cultured in skin differentiation medium. This 2-step approach allowed self-assembly of endothelial networks in the dermis as well as epidermal keratinization (Baltazar et al., 2020) . In the clinical phase of their study, bioprinted skin grafts without human endothelial cells or placental pericytes, with only endothelial cells, and with both endothelial cells and placental pericytes were implanted on the dorsal region of immunodeficient mice after 8 days of in vitro culture (Baltazar et al., 2020) . Bioprinted grafts without endothelial cells and placental pericytes were significantly smaller with a larger area occupied by endogenous mouse skin. Grafts with human endothelial cells contained vascular structures 4 weeks post-engraftment (Baltazar et al., 2020) . The presence of placental pericytes in the printed dermis not only improved keratinocytes maturation and formation of epidermal rete, but also enhanced development of host microvessels into the graft, thereby allowing perfusion through both graft and host microvessels (Baltazar et al., 2020) . This exciting observation shows the potential of incorporating this technology for clinical applications.",

This has been used for chemolytics along with other blood pressure agents to date. The potential advantage of these organoids is that you can rapidly screen agents on human derived tissues so that you can eliminate the need for animal testing. The limitation is are these small clusters of cells behaving in the same way as the native tissue that they were derived from or have they been modified by the culture conditions to grow them. We have addressed the use of cells and the associated vasculature and also nervous tissue so that they may need to make larger organoids that incorporate not only the cells of interest but a blood supply and neuronal intervention to determine if the organoid is truly mimicking the native tissue. Furthermore, the tissues are going to have to be artificially perfused so that the mediate will need to be oxygenated and exchanged on a regular basis to prevent the buildup of waste materials. successfully 3D printed the intestinal models containing villi structures and capillary structures with a dual-cell-printing process (Figure 11) . Two collagen-based bioinks were developed using Caco-2 cells in one and HUVECs in the other. Not only did the 3D structure mimic the function of actual intestinal villi, as confirmed by increased permeability to glucose . Cellular activity of the intestine models with capillary structures had increased cell growth and expression of digestive enzymes and MUC17, a membrane-bound mucin that protects gut epithelial cells . This fabricated vascularized intestinal model is a promising start to the construction of fully functional human intestines .",

In some recent work from our group, we have been able to demonstrate in vivo that a patch created from a combination of smooth muscle and fibroblasts can incorporate into the native tissue and the animal can survive and grow at the same rate as sham controls. What was exciting in this study was that we could show that the endothelium containing crypts and villi migrate across the patch and develop a normal lining in approximately 7 days. For the future the idea to implant an entire section of bioprinted tubular material is exciting. The limitation may be that if the implant is long, it may not be able to reestablish the endogenous lining from the proximal and distal sites of anastomosis. Along with this issue is to make sure that a longer section could be attached to the blood supply rather than wait for the supply to develop, the length will also need to be innervated so that peristalsis can continue across the implant and prevent the development of pools of waste in the print that may lead to a blockage. The next steps in addressing this process are to make longer and longer patches to determine if there is an upper limit as to length for normal endothelial development across the patch. Once these limits have been established, then full tubular replacements can be attempted.",

The release of VEGF from the retinal pigment epithelium layer resulted in the formation of vascular networks for the optimized functioning of the printed layers (Masaeli et al., 2020) . Controlling the placement VEGF release during the construction of the tissue or organoid offers a method of designing and modeling vascular architecture similar to that of the native tissue counterpart. However, due to the carcinogenic nature of VEGF, prints utilizing this method need to be thoroughly investigated in in vivo models before any human implantation (Verheul and Pinedo, 2000; French and Frazier, 2011) .

It appears that printing extremely small capillary beds will not be possible with the present print technologies so the deployment of these prints will require additional work. One thing that should also be remembered is that VEGF should be applied in the prints and then look at histology to determine if VEGF also modified the printed cells in an adverse way.

Lin et al. (2019) produced functional vascularized kidney and proximal tubule models by printing adjacent conduits lined with confluent endothelium and epithelium embedded in a permeable extracellular matrix. The tubule epithelium and vascular endothelium construct displayed similar reabsorption properties to that of native kidney tissue (Lin et al., 2019) . Diseased kidney states can be modeled by exposing the construct to hyperglycemic conditions. This model could be used to study specific aspects of kidney function (i.e., proximal tubule vs. thick ascending and descending limb or collecting duct) and disease modeling in vitro (Lin et al., 2019) . It is important to point out that the complex pathophysiologic aspects of fluid and electrolyte movement and hormonal interactions, as well as bioprinting the full architecture of the kidney and renal tubule, remain an elusive target due to the wide range of cell specialization and function within the kidney. This is compounded with the need to create a printed tissue with millions of nephrons similar to a normal kidney that are highly vascularized and contain many different cell types and a large variety of intraluminal diameters. In addition, the collecting duct has many branches to allow different nephrons to empty into this central conduit (Seldin and Giebisch, 2008) .",

It should be pointed out that the kidney has three different segments in the proximal tubule and that the length and diameter are slightly different in the cortex nephrons and in the medullar nephrons. All nephrons are encased with a vascular network that allows for the secretion and absorption of nutrients and elimination of waste products. To address the issue of providing a blood supply, the first efforts should again involve the use of VEGF to try and establish a vasculature for the proximal tubule. Should this work then becomes the next larger issue in that a kidney has approximately 2 million nephrons so that would require massive efforts to print just the 2 million proximal tubules per kidney, and these alone would not have use unless deployed in a culture model for drug toxicity. This would require a perfusion device to enter the lumen of the nephron and determine function. What we did not address is that the apical surface of the proximal tubule has a variety of villi on the apical surface and the height of the villi changes in the S1, S2, and S3 segments of the proximal tubule. This leads to additional issue that will make a viable proximal tubule to require a great deal of additional research for any use.",

Han et al. (2020) constructed vascularized glioblastoma models for in vitro drug testing with an emphasis on the tumor microenvironment. The tumor microenvironment was created by printing a blood vessel layer using fibroblasts and endothelial cells followed by seeding tumor spheroids of glioblastoma cells onto the blood vessel layer (Figure 12 ; Han et al., 2020) . The increasingly growing tumor spheroids induced angiogenesis from the blood vessel layer as expected for cells in a tumor microenvironment . The treatment with the anti-cancer drug temozolomide and angiogenic inhibitor sunitinib resulted in similar inhibition of tumor and vascular growth as that of real cancer tissues .

It also becomes an ideal target for genetic therapy as it can be examined directly prior to moving to healthy tissues. This is one of the limitations that comes up since it will become critically important to also develop a printed model of the associated healthy tissues to test the same therapies on to assure that the planned therapy will have minimal side effects in the patient that the therapy was designed for.",

There has been a large variety of printing methods, bioinks, and scaffolds used in constructing just one specific tissue type. However, comparative studies on the efficacies of the different constructs in terms of vascular nutrient transport and tissue viability are lacking (Chen and Liu, 2016) . There have been many studies performed on animal models and cell lines, but they often fail to emulate human tissue behavior and contribute to difficulties in translating to human clinical trials (Jovic et al., 2020) . Although current 3D printed vascular network scaffolds are premature for human implantation, simplified tubular blood vessel constructs are adequate for the use of drug screening and high throughput assays (Yu and Choudhury, 2019) . More research is necessary Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org for the development of constructs mimicking complex tissue types such as the human retina and the kidney. Furthermore, there is no suitable tissue culture device to simulate and evaluate the degree to which fabricated tissues mimic its biological counterparts (Yu and Choudhury, 2019) . With the current advances in the incorporation of vasculature into 3D bioprinted tissue and organs, bioprinting remains one of the most promising methods to construct vascularized tissue for implantation that mimics the native tissue that it will replace or support. However, research still needs to be done before 3D printed vascularized tissue constructs can be widely used in human patients (Dimitrievska and Niklason, 2018; Pennarossa et al., 2021) . Meanwhile, the use of fabricated vascularized tissue for in vitro applications such as drug screening and high throughput assays in clinical trials is feasible and would most likely be employed in the near future, thereby reducing the costs for drug development while providing important preclinical information that could be used for both toxicity and efficacy of targeted action of the agent.",
