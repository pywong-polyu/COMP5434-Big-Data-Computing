The admission of Boris Johnson, the UK Prime Minister, to hospital prompted some to portray the disease as a great equaliser, that can affect anyone even the most privileged. But are all communities equally affected? There is growing evidence that the adverse consequences of the pandemic are falling disproportionately on more disadvantaged groups particularly those from ethnic minorities.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Evidence emerging from the United States shows that COVID19 mortality is disproportionately high amongst African Americans and other ethnic minority communities. In Chicago, around 70% of deaths have involved individuals from Black backgrounds despite them making up only 30% of the population, and similar figures have been observed in several other states. 1 2 Estimates suggest that American counties where Black residents are in the majority have almost six times the rate of death due to COVID19 compared to predominantly White counties. 2 In the UK, COVID19 deaths by ethnic group have only recently been reported, showing that 19% of deaths occurring in hospital have involved individuals from ethnic minority backgrounds, even though these groups make up only 14% of the population. 3 Similarly these groups accounted for 35% of all COVID19 patients in critical care units in England. 4 Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) groups may be at greater risk of infection, severe disease and poor outcomes for multiple reasons. These include socioeconomic conditions that increase risk of transmission and vulnerability 5 6 (e.g. overcrowded housing, employment in essential occupations, poverty and reliance on public transport), unequal access to effective health care and higher rates of comorbidities, such as diabetes, hypertension, and cardiovascular diseases. 7 These comorbidities have all been associated with COVID19 mortality 8 9 and they are also more common amongst ethnic minorities. 10, 11 The extent to which the higher COVID19 mortality in BAME groups is primarily due to socioeconomic inequalities is not fully understood and there has been little or no research investigating whether poverty itself is an independent risk factor for COVID19 mortality. The same risks outlined above, e.g. household overcrowding, reliance on public transport, working in essential occupations and increased comorbidities, are also associated with living in poverty, as well as ethnicity. It is challenging to disentangle the potential impacts of socioeconomic factors and ethnicity on adverse health outcomes and there has been much debate, in the UK, about whether ethnic inequalities in health in general are primarily explained by socioeconomic inequalities. 12 13 Ethnic minority groups in the UK are more likely to live in socioeconomically deprived neighbourhoods compared to the White British population, and are more likely to experience poverty and unemployment. 14 15 It is important to understand the relationship between ethnicity, poverty and mortality due to COVID19 in order that resources and control measures can be better targeted at the communities most at risk. We do not know, however, the extent to which these factors explain differences in risk between communities in England.
