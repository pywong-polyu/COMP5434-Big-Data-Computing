The novel delivery platform (liposomal mRNA), along with the lack of data on efficacy and safety in immunosuppressed subjects due to exclusion from clinical trials, 1,2 has led to uncertainty whether to continue or hold immunosuppression to maximize SARS-CoV-2 vaccine efficacy, and discordant guidelines from national medical organizations. [14] [15] [16] Emerging data demonstrate reduced antibody responses in immunosuppressed individuals following mRNA vaccination. Organ transplant recipients receiving antimetabolite therapy and older recipients were less likely to develop an antibody response following the first dose of the BNT162b2 or the mRNA-1273 vaccines. 17 Furthermore, CID patients (n=26) vaccinated with mRNA vaccines had blunted anti-S IgG levels with modest reduction in neutralization in ~25% of subjects compared to immunocompetent controls. 18 Similarly, in 13 IBD patients treated with either TNFi or anti-integrin therapy who completed the two-dose vaccine schedules, reductions in anti-S IgG levels were observed compared to non-IBD controls. 19 While these early observations corroborate suspicions that immunosuppression can reduce antibody responses following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, these studies have inadequate sample sizes to determine which specific immunosuppressive classes drive a reduction in humoral responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.",

Thus, it may be beneficial to withhold BCDT for some duration or, after appropriate study, provide an additional vaccine booster to enable reasonable antibody responses following mRNA-based SARS-CoV-2 vaccination.",

Current guidelines in IBD and psoriasis do not suggest holding biologics, small molecules, or antimetabolites prior to vaccination against SARS-CoV-2. 14, 16 In contrast, the COVID-19 Vaccine Clinical Guidance Summary from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has a moderate-level consensus in holding certain immunosuppressants such as methotrexate and JAKi for 1 week after each vaccine dose for those with well-controlled disease. 15 The blunting of humoral responses in the setting of antimetabolites, TNFi, and JAKi support the initial recommendations from the ACR that certain medications may need to be held in order to optimize vaccine response. Importantly, our study was conducted prior to the release of these recommendations and only five subjects in our cohort held any medications (all methotrexate).",
