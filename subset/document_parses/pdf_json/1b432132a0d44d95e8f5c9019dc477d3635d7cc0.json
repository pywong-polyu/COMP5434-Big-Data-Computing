            "text": "The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic has renewed interest in human coronaviruses that cause the common cold, particularly as research with them at biosafety level (BSL)-2 avoids the added costs and biosafety concerns that accompany work with SARS-CoV-2, BSL-3 research. One of these, human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43), is a well-matched surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 because it is also a Betacoronavirus, targets the human respiratory system, is transmitted via respiratory aerosols and droplets and is relatively resistant to disinfectants. Unfortunately, growth of HCoV-OC43 in the recommended human colon cancer (HRT-18) cells does not produce obvious cytopathic effect (CPE) and its titration in these cells requires expensive antibody-based detection. Consequently, multiple quantification approaches for HCoV-OC43 using alternative cell lines exist, which complicates comparison of research results. Hence, we investigated the basic growth parameters of HCoV-OC43 infection in three of these cell lines (HRT-18, human lung fibroblasts (MRC-5) and African green monkey kidney (Vero E6) cells) including the differential development of cytopathic effect (CPE) and explored reducing the cost, time and complexity of antibody-based detection assay. Multi-step growth curves were conducted in each cell type in triplicate at a multiplicity of infection of 0.1 with daily sampling for seven days. Samples were quantified by tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID 50 )/mL or plaque assay (cell line dependent) and additionally analyzed on the Sartorius Virus Counter 3100 (VC), which uses flow virometry to count the total number of intact virus particles in a sample. We improved the reproducibility of a previously described antibody-based detection based TCID 50 assay by identifying commercial sources for antibodies, decreasing antibody concentrations and simplifying the detection process. The growth curves demonstrated that HCoV-O43 grown in MRC-5 cells reached a peak titer of 10 7 plaque forming units/mL at two days post infection (dpi). In contrast, HCoV-OC43 grown on HRT-18 cells required six days to reach a peak titer of \u030310 6.5 TCID 50 /mL. HCoV-OC43 produced CPE in Vero E6 cells but these growth curve samples failed to produce CPE in a plaque assay after four days. Analysis of the VC data in combination with plaque and TCID 50 assays together revealed that the defective:infectious virion ratio of MRC-5 propagated HCoV-OC43 was less than 3:1 for 1-6 dpi while HCoV-OC43 propagated in HRT-18 cells varied from 41:1 at 1 dpi, to 329:4 at 4 dpi to 94:1 at 7 dpi. These results should enable better comparison of extant HCoV-OC43 study results and prompt further standardization efforts.",

Early in the current pandemic, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) issued guidance on SARS-CoV-2 surrogate virus selection for projects focusing on study of the persistence of the virus in different environments and the development and testing of decontamination procedures (ASTM 2020). The ASTM identified human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) (order: Nidovirales, family: Coronaviridae, genus: Betacoronavirus, subgenus: Embecovirus, species: Betacoronavirus 1) as a preferred surrogate on account of its shared characteristics with SARS-CoV-2. As members of the same genus, Betacoronavirus, HCoV-OC43 and SARS-CoV-2 are closely related genetically (Lu et al., 2020) . Both replicate in human respiratory epithelium and are transmitted by aerosols and droplets (Kutter et al., 2018) . Although a rare occurrence, HCoV-OC43 has caused fatal encephalitis in immunocompromised humans. It can infect human neural cell lines and its neurotropic and neuroinvasive properties have been characterized in mice Talbot, 2003, 2006) . Finally, HCoV-OC43 is more resistant than other human coronaviruses to quaternary ammonium disinfectants, such as benzalkonium chloride (Wood and Payne, 1998) . Since the nature of our current research is focused accordingly, we selected HCoV-OC43 as our surrogate for methods development for our SARS-CoV-2 environmental virology research.",

            "text": "While using HCoV-OC43 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 may have advantages over other coronaviruses or non-coronavirus surrogates, working with HCoV-OC43 also has its difficulties. Prior to the SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreaks in 2003 and 2012 respectively, research with human coronaviruses was fairly limited, likely because infections cause relatively mild disease, i.e. \"the common cold,\" and are typically restricted to the upper respiratory tract. Also, a review of extant literature finds researchers using a variety of methods to quantify HCoV-OC43 employing different cell lines, HRT-18 (human colon cancer cells) (Lambert et al., 2008) , RD (human rhabdosarcoma cells) (Schmidt et al., 1979) , MRC-5 (human lung fibroblasts) (Collins, 1993 (Collins, , 1995 Kim et al., 2019) , BSC-1(African green monkey kidney cells) (Bruckova et al., 1970) , Vero E6 expressing TMPRSS2 (Hirose et al., 2021) and Mv1Lu (mink lung cells) (Bracci et al., 2020) , using different titration assay types (either TCID 50 or plaque assay), the latter with different types (agarose, Avicel, methylcellulose) and percentages of overlays, employing different incubation temperatures (33 \u2022 C or 37 \u2022 C), times (2-7 days) and detection methods (immunoperoxidase with chromagen, immunofluorescence, neutral red and crystal violet). This lack of standardization hampers evaluation and comparison of study results, as the different cell lines may have different growth kinetics and susceptibilities to virus grown in heterologous cells.",

Prior to sample titration, a screening assay was conducted, using the Combo Dye kit (Sartorius, Stedim) per manufacturer's instructions, to determine the appropriate dilution for the virus samples. Briefly, Combo Dye Concentrate was rehydrated and diluted with Combo Dye Buffer. The cell culture media (used as a control for background signal in the media) and the HCoV-OC43 stock virus were diluted to 1:10, 1:100, 1:1000 and 1:10000 in Sample Dilution Buffer, 100 \u03bcL of each dilution and 50 \u03bcL of the diluted Combo Dye were added to each sample vial, mixed and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. The samples were then run on the Virus Counter and the optimal dilution range was calculated using the Virus Counter software. Once the appropriate dilution was determined, all samples from each of the growth curves were diluted, stained with Combo Dye as described above and run on the Virus Counter in duplicate. The average titers of all sample duplicates were calculated using the Virus Counter software. For a titer to be considered reliable values for both runs needs to exceed two internal quality thresholds.",

While HCoV-OC43 infection of HRT-18 cells produced no obvious CPE during the 7day growth curve, as expected, infection of MRC-5 cells and surprisingly, Vero E6 cells displayed clear and obvious CPE beginning at day 2 and day 3, respectively. To further investigate this we quantified the growth curve samples from these cell lines using plaque assays on the same cell line. The MRC-5 plaque assays produced countable, although pleomorphic, plaques after a four-day incubation. Bracci et al. (2020) also tested HCoV-OC43 in a plaque assay using MRC-5 cells with a five-day incubation at 37 \u2022 C. They concluded that plaques were countable, but that MRC-5 cells were too slow-growing and variable to further optimize the assay (Bracci et al., 2020) . The incubation time for plaques to develop in MRC-5 cells may need to be shortened to less than four days to prevent the plaques from growing together or a higher percentage overlay used such that its viscosity better restricts the movement of the virus. Previous studies with MRC-5 cells in HCoV-OC43 plaque assays used agarose overlays, which may better limit the spreading of plaques (Collins, 1995; Funk et al., 2012; Warnes et al., 2015) . Alternatively, using MRC-5 cells in a TCID 50 format for HCoV-OC43 quantification would alleviate the need for distinguishable plaques and might be a useful assay when greater throughput is needed.",

The lack of CPE in the current experiment as well as in Hirose et al. (2021) may have been caused by terminating the incubation period prior to the virus reaching sufficient levels to cause CPE. The length of time needed for low titer HCoV-OC43 to develop CPE was not determined in our study, but based on our data it is greater than 7 days. This extended incubation time needed for HCoV-OC43 to produce CPE in Vero E6 cells precludes their usefulness in a standard method of quantification and emphasizes the need to know the susceptibility of the cell line being used for quantification.",

HCoV-OC43 propagated in HRT-18 cells was used in the growth curve experiments at the same MOI (0.1) and while the HRT-18 and Vero E6 growth curves were very similar, the virus grown in MRC-5 cells grew to a higher titer, faster than in the other cell types. Additionally, HCoV-OC43 propagated in MRC-5 cells had a lower titer (7.57 log 10 PFU/mL) when titered on MRC-5 cells than when quantified using HRT-18 cells (10.5 log 10 TCID 50 /mL). HCoV-OC43 grown in Vero E6 cells developed no plaques in Vero E6 cells despite showing CPE during the replication kinetics experiment. However, we were able to successfully quantify these samples using the TCID 50 assay with HRT-18 cells. This suggests that HCoV-OC43 may use a different mechanism to enter Vero E6 cells and fewer cells may become infected per unit time. Further support for this idea came from a TCID 50 assay of the stock HCoV-OC43 virus (grown in HRT-18 cells) using Vero E6 cells in which CPE was present only in the 10 \u2212 1 dilution at 7 dpi but an HRT-18 based log 10 TCID 50 /mL titer was 6.0. Understanding that virus titer can change based on which cell lines are used to propagate as well as quantify the virus is important when comparing results from multiple studies, especially in a field with few gold standards for assays. Based on our investigations, we would recommend propagating virus and quantifying samples on the same cell type.",

While this method produces results in less time than traditional cell-based assays it has the disadvantages of potentially counting fragments of RNA as full genomes, counting viral transcripts as genomes and being unable to determine if a genome is part of an infectious virion. Flow virometry is a new technology that uses the principles of flow cytometry to determine the number of intact virus particles in a sample. As implemented in the Virus Counter 3100, this method greatly reduces the time needed to quantify virus samples, however, it too is unable to determine if a virus particle is infectious. Consequently, use of the Virus Counter in combination with assays that determine infectious virus concentration, as done here, enables determination of the number of defective virus particles (defective virions) produced at different points during propagation. Defective virions are produced when a mutation or deletion occurs during replication or a mistake is made in virus packaging (Alnaji and Brooke, 2020; Vignuzzi and Lopez, 2019) . Often defective virions are able to enter cells, at times via alternative paths such as macropinocytosis, but they fail to complete the replication cycle without a co-infecting helper virus. When a helper virus is present the defective genome may have an advantage as the smaller defective genome can be replicated faster. In addition, competition for resources within the cell can negatively impact the production of infectious virus, driving down viral titers (Alnaji and Brooke, 2020; Makino et al., 1984) . Defective virions are known to impact viral persistence, pathogenesis and evolution (Vignuzzi and Lopez, 2019) . Therefore, it is important to monitor the production of defective virions in virus stocks to prevent unusual and ungeneralizable results.",

However, we did not continue to passage HCoV-OC43 in MRC-5 cells so it is possible that defective virions may increase with further passaging. The impact of the immune response of MRC-5 cells to HCoV-OC43 infection and the production of defective virions is also currently unknown.",

The concentration of virus particles/ mL continued to increase until 7 dpi when total virus particles were nearly 100 times the TCID 50 /mL. This pattern suggests that in the early part of the growth curve the less fit HCoV-OC43 genomes in Vero E6 cells are selected against because they fail to replicate. Defective virions may then increase after a threshold of infection wherein co-infections can occur. For our experiment, this threshold appears to occur between 3 dpi and 4 dpi when the log 10 TCID 50 /mL is between 5.67 and 6.55 and the D:I at 4 dpi is 1.5.",

We improved the indirect immunoperoxidase detection method of Lambert et al. (2008) by identifying commercial sources of antibodies and reducing the time, cost and complexity of the protocol by adjusting incubation times in multiple steps, optimizing antibody dilutions and volumes and changing the detection system. Our comparison of growth parameters of HCoV-OC43 propagation in three cell lines (HRT-18, MRC-5 and Vero E6) found that HCoV-OC43 propagated in MRC-5 cells achieved a higher titer (\u03037.0 log 10 PFU/mL) that peaked at 2 dpi compared to that in HRT-18 cells (6.5 log 10 TCID 50 /mL at 6 dpi). Our findings showed that Vero E6 cells are susceptible to HCoV-OC43 infection and infection at an MOI of 0.1 results in CPE. Finally, we calculated the D:I for HCoV-OC43 grown in each cell line. The virus propagated in MRC-5 cells had the lowest D:I, ranging from 0.5:1 to 2.9:1 over 6 days, then rising to 22.1:1 at 7 dpi. HCoV-OC43 propagated on HRT-18 cells had the highest D:I of 329.4:1 on 4 dpi, while the Vero E6 propagated HCoV-OC43 had a D:I of 1.5:1 at 4 dpi. The HRT-18 and Vero E6 propagated viruses, respectively, had ratios of 94:1 and 97:1 at 7 dpi. We hope that the basic parameters provided here will assist researchers using HCoV-OC43 as a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 in their choice of cells for propagation and quantification of HCoV-OC43, as well as, encourage the development and use of standardized methods to increase the comparability and reproducibility of future human coronavirus research.
