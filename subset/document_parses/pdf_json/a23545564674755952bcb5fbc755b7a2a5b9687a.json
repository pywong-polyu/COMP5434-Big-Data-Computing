The bronchoalveolar lavage effluent has a turbid and milky appearance due to the presence of foamy macrophages or monocyte-like alveolar macrophages with an increased number of lymphocytes. These changes are associated with a large periodic acid-Shift (PAS) positive acellular background of diffuse eosinophilic bodies [4, 6] , which is diagnostic of PAP. The presence of lamellar bodies under electron microscope examination can be used to confirm the diagnosis. These abnormalities translate into an enormous accumulation of surfactant lipoprotein in pulmonary alveoli leading to the clinical findings of increase alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient and hypoxemia.",

This procedure is performed to remove the excess surfactant proteins and lipids from the alveolar spaces in order to improve gas exchange. Most published case series, as well as a recent global survey, have shown that most centers perform WLL on two separate sessions [8] . In our institution, we have been performing bilateral, sequential WLL on one session (OSBSWLL) since 1994, although inconsistently initially, it became more consistent over the past 15 years. We believe that OSBSWLL is safe to perform, comfortable for the patient, and could reduce costs of a second procedural session. Per our knowledge, this is the largest case series of OSBSWLL reported.",

The team involved in the procedure include: an interventional pulmonologist, an anesthesiologist, respiratory therapists, and experienced operating room assistants. In the operating room, general anesthesia and muscle paralysis are induced by the anesthesiologist. The patient is placed in a supine position and intubated with a 39 Fr doublelumen endotracheal tube (dETT) (or smaller depending on the size of patient). After the position of the dETT in the airways is confirmed by flexible bronchoscopy (pediatric scope), the dETT is secured in place. A \"leak test\" is then performed: a single lumen endotracheal tube is attached to a connector allowing it to be secured to the dETT, with the tip placed in a bottle of saline, which will hence be referred to as the leak test kit (LTK). Initially one side of the dETT is connected to the LTK and the other to the ventilator. Airway pressures are increased by the ventilator and held sequentially at 20, 30 and 40 cm H2O. The airway pressures are then fluctuated between 40 and 50 cm H2O looking for bubbling in the saline from the end of the LTK. If no bubbling is observed, the process is repeated on the opposite side of the dETT. If both \"leak tests\" are negative, we proceed to stabilize the head of patient and tubing system by using towels, blankets and padding to avoid pressure ulcers on the patient's face and skin ( Fig. 1 ). The flexible bronchoscope is then used to confirm positioning one more time.",

Cardiopulmonary physical therapists provide manual percussion of the chest throughout the procedure in order to achieve better mobilization and subsequently improved removal of particulate matter and instilled fluid. After the first two liters are instilled into the lung, the inflow portion of the tubing circuit is closed and the effluent from the lung is drained by gravity into a suction canister which is calibrated by milliliters. Initially, one liter of effluent is drained and one liter of saline remains in the lung to maintain patency of the lung. The process of instillation and drainage is repeated using one-liter aliquots for both the in and out portions of the procedure. Visible clearing of the effluent is used as the marker to stop the lavage. Effluent clearing usually requires approximately 16 L of fluid per lung. When the effluent has cleared enough (Fig. 3) , the final drainage will include the one liter of initially instilled into the lung. The patient is then reassessed to decide if the procedure for the second lung can safely be completed. Assessment of vital signs, including pulsoximetry, as well as bronchoscopic confirmation of the dETT are done before moving on to the second lung. Then we proceed to perform the \"degassing maneuver\" on the second lung (as described above).",

In our series, only 2 cases (6.6%) required mechanical ventilation longer than 4 h after OSBSWLL due to hypoxia. One of them, who was treated for pneumonia post-operatively, also had a large residual volume (2,500 mL) that could have contributed to hypoxia. Pneumothorax has also been described in WLL due to excessive alveolar distention [11] . Even though, none of the patients who underwent OSBSWLL developed pneumothorax, one of the patients who was initially scheduled for OSBSWLL could not complete lavage of the second lung due to hypoxia that was later deemed to be secondary to pneumothorax on the lavaged lung, which required a chest tube placement and admission to ICU.
