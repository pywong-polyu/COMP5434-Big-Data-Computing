Health care delivery in circumpolar regions poses unique challenges that result in health care systems relying on short-term locum providers who come from outside the region [6] . Similar to Canada, Australia has a vast expanse of land making it difficult to recruit health professionals in remote areas [7] . Researchers in Australia have found that individuals living in remote areas, including Indigenous communities, are made vulnerable to COVID-19 due to geographical and historical factors; as a result, they face higher rates of chronic disease and other socio-economic factors such as overcrowding, making compliance with social distancing guidelines difficult [8] . Residents of Indigenous communities in northern Canada experience similar vulnerabilities [9] as Indigenous peoples in Australia. While researchers have examined FIFO services globally [7, 10, 11] , to our knowledge, there is little peer-reviewed research on FIFO mental health service provision in northern Canada. Furthermore, we were unable to find any academic literature on the impact of COVID-19 on FIFO mental health service providers in the northern Canadian context. To understand the implications of COVID-19 on the delivery of FIFO mental health provisions in Inuit communities in northern Canada, we conducted interviews with eight FIFO mental health providers. Our goal was to understand the experience of FIFO providers and to learn from the current situation to make recommendations as providers move forward with considerations of pandemic risks.",

            "text": "In a position paper titled Development and Implementation of the Arctic Policy Framework, Inuit Tapiriit Kanatami (ITK) [16] acknowledged the gap in infrastructure that affects Inuit Nunangat. In its report, ITK recognised this gap as a barrier to the economic, social, and cultural development of Inuit and non-Inuit alike. Recently, 15, the Nunavut Land Claims organisation, published a report titled Nunavut's Infrastructure Gap, which echoed ITK's statements regarding the effects of lack of infrastructure. Highlighted in this document were infrastructure gaps specific to the Nunavut context that contribute to poverty and lower quality of life for Inuit such as gaps in housing, education, health, telecommunications among many others [15] . This report addressed serious gaps in mental health-related infrastructure, citing a lack of facilities and low percentage of residents with a regular health care provider [15] . Limited access to mental services further perpetuates mental health problems in Inuit communities. Health care such as physician services delivered outside of main hubs are often delivered remotely but can be hindered by poor internet connections [15] . Due to the remoteness of communities in Inuit Nunangat, internet connectively plays an important role in enabling access to healthcare and education among other factors. When this document was published in 2018, it was reported that all but one community in Inuit Nunangat are served by satellite, with a lack of fibre optic connectivity across the region [16] , resulting in slow and unreliable internet. Difficulties in telecommunications have been emphasised during the COVID-19 pandemic, during which many services shifted to be online.",

            "text": "Telemental health is described as the delivery of mental health services through telecommunications or computerised services [18] . This term is used broadly to include a wide range of services and professionals that provide mental health care from a distance both in real time, such as in videoconferencing or over the telephone, and asynchronously through email [18] . Traditional mental health systems (i.e. in person) often do not meet the needs of communities in remote areas due to their geographical location [18] , and so telemental health offers an alternative to rural and remote populations by enhancing access to mental health services for underserved and hard to reach populations with restricted mobility such as geographical limitations [19] . Two notable studies have looked at the use of telemental health services for Indigenous peoples across Canada from the providers' perspective. 20 and 21,concluded that providers found telemental health to be a beneficial extension of conventional in-person mental health services to rural and remote communities. 20 noted the benefits of telemental health in rural First Nations communities by acknowledging that this model provides continuity of care and allows clients to remain in community while receiving therapeutic services. However, the authors noted that this type of service delivery is not without its challenges, such as concerns regarding infrastructure and cultural appropriateness [20] . 21, who looked at service provision in various Inuit and Cree communities in northern Quebec as part of their study, recognised the technological limitations by expressing concerns of reduction in efficiency of telemental services as a result of outdated computers. In another study, 22 researched community experiences of telemental health services and found that clients associated the use of these services with an increase in access and continuity of mental health services. Participants in their study recognised the benefits of not having to travel, and commented on how videoconferencing may facilitate disclosure through increased comfort of communicating online [22] . Alternatively, some clients in the study questioned the usefulness and appropriateness of these services, and expressed concerns about privacy and safety 22. COVID-19 has served as a catalyst for the implementation of telemental health as the demand for services and resources are rising and the ability to provide inperson care is limited due to travel restrictions [5] .",

In January 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a public health emergency, which was later characterised as a pandemic when infection rates increased globally [24] . Of significant concern is how COVID-19 not only compromises physical health, but also how it affects mental health and wellbeing [1] . Work and school closures, a lack of medical resources, and physical and emotional isolation have resulted in negative health outcomes such as emotional distress and unhealthy behaviours such as substance abuse [23] . Recent research suggests that COVID-19 is having a negative impact on Canadians' mental health, with stress levels doubling since the onset of the pandemic [25] . Particular populations are at an increased risk of experiencing psychosocial effects related to COVID-19 including racialised individuals, Indigenous peoples, individuals with disability, and low-wage workers who live in communal housing due to the pre-existing inequities in access to health care [25] . Health-care professionals are particularly vulnerable to increased stress as a result of increased work hours, safety concerns, and participation in resource-allocation decisions [23, 26] . Mental health providers play an essential role in mitigating emotional outcomes from the pandemic [23] , though they themselves are not immune from the adverse effects of COVID-19.",

Mental health service providers who deliver services to Inuit communities are affected by COVID-19 due to travel restrictions and quarantine recommendations by community leaders, governments, and organisations in Inuit Nunangat [27] . In response to these new guidelines, many mental health providers have shifted their practice to incorporate telehealth services. As expected, this pivot has come with its own challenges for implementation. Commonly reported barriers to offering services via telehealth or online include concerns regarding privacy and safety, impact on rapport building between provider and clients, reduced nonverbal communication (gestures), and insufficient technological support [5, 28] . In an Australian study in which researchers examined the impacts of COVID-19 on Aboriginal peoples and Torres Strait Islanders, these populations were found to experience a higher prevalence of chronic diseases and tobacco use but were also affected by socio-economic factors such as overcrowding, rendering Indigenous populations particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 [8] . In addition to the existing challenges that residents of remote communities face in accessing and receiving care in Australia, additional workforce challenges have also been noted during the pandemic such as changes in national demand for short-term work force and increased risk of losing permanent staff due to burnout [8] . Although it is a different country and cultural context, there are some overlapping concerns that relate to Inuit communities in Canada [9] .",

Furthermore, travelling health care providers can enhance quality of existing care in rural regions [7] . Although there are benefits to these services, FIFO models of care are not without challenges. 33,recognised the high cost associated with travel to remote communities, and the pressures to accommodate travelling staff at local sites as drawbacks to this model of care. 7,also noted that while this model can be convenient for community members, providers have to sometimes \"waste their time travelling\" to communities, which can be seen as unproductive. Much of the demand for FIFO providers is due to limited community capacity to offer services locally, and a lack of interest from medical staff to permanently reside in rural and remote communities [7, 31] . Other well-documented barriers to attracting permanent health care professionals in rural and remote communities include long hours, poor access to professional development and training, high cost of services such as food and travel, and feelings of isolation [7, 31] . Nevertheless, when implemented effectively, FIFO services can ensure that residents of rural and remote communities have access to health care practitioners.",

For the purposes of this paper, participant names have been replaced with pseudonyms to protect their identities. Inclusion criteria including speaking English and having experience with the delivery of mental health services to residents of communities in Inuit Nunangat. All participants were recruited through emails shared by our partner organisation and through snowball sampling. The study sample included mental health service providers who have completed training/education in social work or counselling. All eight participants identify as Caucasian, including six women and two men who reside outside of Inuit Nunangat. Participants reported working in a FIFO capacity for between one year to ten years. Prior to being hired with NCTS, all participants had a minimum of ten years' counselling experience, most of whom worked with Indigenous populations and communities. The participants described spending differing amounts of time in communities based on the types of contracts they had. Time spent in the community ranged from a few weeks for crisis response, shortterm staff fill in, and ongoing organisation support to months for school settings and longer-term staff fill in.",

Do you foresee remote counselling as a sustainable solution/option for fly in-/flyout service providers moving forward? Do you foresee any lasting impacts that COVID-19 may have on the fly-in/flyout community of mental health practitioners? Each interview lasted between 45 and 90 minutes. All interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim, accuracy checked by the first author, and sent back the participants for verification. Two participants made slight changes to their transcripts, while one participant included additional information. Considering the rapidly changing COVID-19 situation, at the time of the interviews, the communities serviced by the participants had minimal to no cases of the virus; this changed just prior to our analysis; thus, a follow-up email was sent to participants to determine if/how their situations had changed. Questions in the follow-up email included: How has the recent increase of COVID-19 cases changed the demand for your services? As a result of the uptake in COVID-19 cases, have you experienced any different/new challenges with remote counselling?",

To our knowledge, this is the first study focused on the impacts of COVID-19 for FIFO providers in Canada. The rapid and drastic changes that required changing inperson mental health service delivery in Inuit Nunangat to telemental health services presented numerous challenges for providers. Prior to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, providers reported delivering mental health services face-to-face with limited usage of telemental health services. Mental health providers recognised the difficulties of travelling given the restrictions and guidelines put in place by community leaders, governments, and organisations in Inuit Nunangat [27] , while acknowledging that community members may not feel comfortable with individuals entering the community from areas in the South with higher rates of COVID-19. Fulfiling the required isolation period for travelling to different provinces and territories (for instance, selfisolation for two weeks before and two weeks after) was deemed to be too expensive and would demand considerable time resources from the provider. Although these challenges among others were identified, providers acknowledged the opportunities to enhance mental health service delivery to Inuit communities through increased use of digital technology and online tools. Although advantages to telemental health service provision was noted, providers maintained the importance of providing in-person care.

            "text": "Participants in our study identified barriers to optimal mental health service delivery as including logistical challenges such as lack of technology, privacy and safety concerns, and difficulties with establishing relationships with clients and the community. Lack of technology (and/or lack of access) was most frequently reported as a challenge to providing virtual mental health care. Additionally, they presented concerns over privacy as a challenge for clients, which is unsurprising given the high rate of overcrowding in homes in Inuit communities [9] . These logistical challenges are consistent with researchers findings from the Netherlands, which explored the sudden change in service provision as a result of COVID-19 [28] . We interviewed mental health practitioners to understand the implications of swift and drastic transfer of practices from in-person to online. The practitioners reported similar technological and usability problems that impacted their ability to establish rapport with clients. Outside of the COVID-19 context, in a systemic review of healthcare providers' attitudes towards telemental health in eight countries including Canada [36] , the researchers similarly found that healthcare providers were concerned their services would be affected by insufficient technological infrastructure. In our study, the providers felt the therapeutic interaction was also affected by not having the opportunity to build rapport with clients and within the community. Providers highlighted the difficulties of service provision in communities with which they had no pre-established relationship prior to COVID-19 by emphasising the effectiveness of virtual counselling in communities where they have previously worked and built relationships. This, as suggested by David, could perhaps be improved by establishing a continuum of services that allows practitioners to continue to build relationships after leaving the community, thereby eliminating some of the challenges being described. Although this would demand initial contact to be in-person, it does provide continuity of care when providers fly-out of the community. This, however, brings its own challenges as providers have concerns with not being physically present in the community. Similar to perspectives presented in our research, in their systematic review, 36, found that healthcare providers had safety and legal concerns regarding the inability to be physically present within a community, especially in cases of crisis or in circumstances that would require further action, such as transferring patients to a hospital [36] . For providers to feel supported in successfully adapting to telemental health services, connections to on-the-ground services and the community were deemed essential, highlighting the need to be familiar with the community and its resources. Although establishing a continuum of care was strongly encouraged by service providers we interviewed, there are broader potential implications that must be considered. The lack of infrastructure reported by [16] , may not support virtual counselling while the provider is away from the community, and issues of privacy remain a concern. Furthermore, there is an additional cost to having providers and clients engage with a long-term continuum of services such as travel and accommodations. These barriers are ongoing concerns that must be met before effective implementation of a continuum of care. In an Australian study, [8] noted that the pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of communities who rely on FIFO staff, and suggest a \"well-funded, appropriately trained, stable and accessible health workforce in all remote communities\" (pg. 4). While efforts are made to work towards stable and accessible workforces in remote communities, FIFO service provision will remain a crucial aspect of care for the foreseeable future for Inuit communities in northern Canada.",

The drastic change to service delivery created space for adaptations including enhancements to the continuum of care by incorporating telemental health services, advancing platforms to facilitate the delivery of these services, and re-envisioning medical spaces to accommodate these additional services. These results are largely in line with Australian scholars' findings on perceived opportunities for telemental health as a result of COVID-19. They found that the virus has created increased potential for digital technology through improving accessibility and quality of mental health service provision [3, 37] . [36] noted that clinician satisfaction with telehealth via videoconferencing in mental healthcare is positive, citing advantages such increasing access to care for patients in remote communities and saving time and money while increasing efficiency of services. These findings are in accordance with the results from our study who agreed that telemental health could provide many opportunities regardless of the difficulties that may arise.",

Given that the focus of this paper was on FIFO service providers' perspectives, we identify that the most important perspective should be the clients seeking care. It is imperative that mental health providers and policymakers for Inuit should, first and foremost, consult the communities and local government before applying results. Research on the perspectives of Inuit towards changing models of care is of the utmost importance and is essential to understand the applicability of FIFO services combined with telemental health strategies. While not the focus of the paper, certainly another limitation is the lack of consideration of local health workforce in Inuit communities. 8,described challenges faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Australia that, much like Inuit in remote Canada, rely heavily on FIFO staff. The authors called for a well-funded workforce based in all remote communities which may alleviate some challenges noted in this paper. For suggestions such as long-term counselling interventions to be effective, understanding clients' perspectives and health outcomes is crucial, and needs to be a future area of research. Further understanding of Inuit perspectives and needs must be addressed.",

This research adds a nuanced perspective to the growing literature on telemental health strategies with Indigenous communities in Canada by considering the COVID-19 context and providers who serve Inuit Nunangat communities. The information presented in this study highlight the complexity of offering mental health services in a pandemic and suggests opportunities to build upon the FIFO model of care. COVID-19 has served as an impetus for change to the continuum of FIFO services to Inuit communities to include a combination of face-to-face care and telemental services. Our findings provide insight into the complexities of mental health providers delivering traditionally inperson services online. Central are the challenges that providers face in adapting rapidly developing their services to meet the needs of individuals and the community. Importantly, there are opportunities to enhance FIFO model of care for communities in Inuit Nunangat, and an opportunity for providers who share unique relationships with the communities they service to voice their perspectives on the rapid change of service delivery due to COVID-19. Pivotal to such changes is the need for research that evaluates the applicability of FIFO synergistic models of care in Inuit communities. Argued here is the need for a more comprehensive continuum of care that can withstand rapid changes to service delivery if need be.",
