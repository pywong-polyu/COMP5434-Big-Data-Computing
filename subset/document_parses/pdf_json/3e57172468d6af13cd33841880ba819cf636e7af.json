In-hospital overall mortality rate was 38% (30/79 patients). The probabilities of dying and being intubated during the follow-up using Kaplan-Meier method were significantly lower in total patients treated with TCZ compared to those of patients not treated with TCZ (log-rank p value = 0.006 and 0.036, respectively). However, using Cox multivariate analyses adjusted for age and Charlson comorbidity index only the association with the reduced risk of being intubated or dying maintained the significance (HR 0.44, 95%CI 0.22-0.89, p = 0.022). Two patients treated with TCZ developed cavitating lung lesions during the follow-up. Conclusions: This study shows that TCZ treatment may be effective in COVID-19 patients with severe respiratory impairment receiving NIV. More data on safety are required. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these results.",

Even in Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) infection, the presence of elevated levels of serum pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and IFN-\u03b1) and chemokines (IL-8, CXCL-10 and CCL5) is documented in the most severe forms compared to the milder ones [5] . With regard to SARS-CoV-2, the most commonly elevated cytokines were IL2, IL-6, IL7, IL10, GSCF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1a, and TNF \u03b1, the levels of which were higher in the more compromised patients [2, 6] . It is important to note that the levels of IL-6 in the blood of the patients with severe disease were higher than those observed in patients with milder disease and an association between elevated IL-6 serum levels and increased mortality rates was found [6, 7] .",

Therefore, all 38 patients who started NIV in this period were not treated with TCZ and they represented the control group. Patients were treated with TCZ at the beginning of NIV. The primary outcome was the in-hospital mortality rate. A secondary composite outcome of no response to TCZ was represented by the patients who were intubated or died during the hospitalization in the pulmonology unit. To obtain data on infections, one of the authors (MF) revised the medical records of all patients. Only infections occurring after administration of TCZ were included in the treatment group.",

However, this formulation did not completely mimic the pharmacodynamic activity and the dosage of the IV formulation, even if we used SC dosages higher compared to those used in rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory conditions. It is important to note that the SC route takes some days to reach the peak plasma concentration after a single dose. This is due to the slow absorption through the lymphatic system into the systemic circulation [15, 16] . To overcome these limitations, the patients were simultaneously treated with multiple separate injections of SC TCZ. This strategy was supported from the findings of a comparative pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of SC vs IV TCZ [15] . We did not observe significant differences in the mortality rate and in the proportion of patients who were intubated or died in the pulmonology unit between patients treated with SC TCZ and those untreated; however, possible differences in efficacy between the two formulations of TCZ in COVID-19 ARDS must be confirmed by larger studies. The small number of the patients treated with SC formulation may have influenced the negative results. In the literature, there are reports demonstrating the efficacy of SC TCZ in reducing the mortality of severe COVID-19 pneumonia [13] .

In these patients, glucocorticoids at high doses and/or IVs TCZ have become the treatment of choice in real life [20] . Although some retrospective and observational studies using TCZ in severe COVID-19 have shown promising results [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , other studies, including the preliminary results of randomized trials, and a systemic review and meta-analysis did not demonstrate a benefit for TCZ in improving clinical status or reducing the risk of ICU admission and mortality [21, 22] . However, TCZ may be effective in particular subgroups of patients, as we showed in this study in patients underlying NIV or Somers et al. in patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [23] . In a recent randomized trial, the use of dexamethasone in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 resulted in lower 28-day mortality among patients who were receiving either invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone at randomization, but not among those receiving no respiratory support [8] . Therefore, the combined use of TCZ and GCs may be useful in patients with severe COVID-19 pneumonia to prevent invasive mechanical ventilation and/or death. In this regard, a recent prospective study demonstrated that a therapeutic strategy constituted by a course of high dose methylprednisolone, followed by tocilizumab if needed, may accelerate respiratory recovery, lower hospital mortality, and reduce the likelihood of invasive mechanical ventilation in COVID-19-associated cytokine storm syndrome [24] . A treatment with high-dose glucocorticoids as first therapeutic choice may also be convenient since glucocorticoids are safe, widely available and inexpensive.",

Somers et al. demonstrated that superinfections were common in patients with severe COVID-19 treated with TCZ and requiring invasive mechanical ventilation [23] . In this study, patients who received TCZ were more than twice as likely to develop a superinfection than untreated controls, driven primarily by a large increase in ventilator-associated pneumonia. Staphylococcus aureus accounted for~50% of bacterial pneumonia. We observed cavitating lung lesions in 2/41 (4.8%) patients treated with TCZ, while none of such lesions were observed in the untreated patients. Staphylococcus aureus was isolated in the first patient, while no infectious agent was identified at cultural examination in the second; however, antibiotic treatment resolved the lesions in both patients. Probably, our study underestimates the incidence of severe infections; however, all secondary infections were accurately reviewed to ensure careful reporting. Furthermore, differently from Somers et al. study, we have enrolled noninvasively ventilated patients who are less exposed to superinfections compared to those receiving invasive mechanical ventilation.",

An important observation to report is that humidified high-flow nasal cannula (HHFNC) was not routinely used in our hospital because of shortage of devices during the first period of the pandemic. Furthermore, we preferentially use NIV for our better experience on this technique. For these reasons, NIV has been utilized in patients with a moderate to severe disease in our Unit as the first choice. On the other hand, during the outbreak, there was also a low ICU bed availability, having some difficulties in treating many patients with mechanical ventilation. Another limitation is that TCZ route of administration was heterogeneous and there are not definitive data regarding similarities in effectiveness between IV and SC formulations, considering the different pharmacokinetic characteristics. Also differences in ICU strain with restrictions on ICU access during the study period, differences in the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia at admission, in comorbidities and age could have influenced patient mortality and then the positive results of TCZ. However, multivariate analysis was corrected by age and comorbidity index and the only factor influencing the treatment choice was drug availability. Strength of the study was that all patients were homogeneously followed-up using a common standardized protocol. Furthermore, in Reggio Emilia-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, the mortality rate reached a plateau 1 month after hospitalization [25] ; therefore, our study had an adequate follow-up period (median was 60 days) to properly observe COVID-19 related deaths.",

This may represent a subgroup of patients in which TCZ is particularly effective. However, regarding safety, in particular the increased risk of developing superinfections, more data are needed. Multicenter randomized controlled studies enrolling large series of patients are needed to confirm the efficacy and safety of TCZ in COVID-19 patients with respiratory involvement of different severity levels and to evaluate if there are differences in efficacy between SC and IV formulation of this drug.
