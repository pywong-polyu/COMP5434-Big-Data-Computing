We found a 20% drop in the number of code strokes in 2020 compared to 2019, immediately after the first cases of COVID-19 were officially confirmed. There were no changes in the number of stroke admissions and there was a 22% decrease in the number of clinic referrals, only after the provincial lockdown. Our findings suggest that the decrease in code strokes was mainly driven by patient-related factors such as fear to be exposed to the SARS-CoV-2, while the reduction in clinic referrals was largely explained by hospital policies and the Government lockdown.",

Nous avons tent\u00e9 d'\u00e9valuer l'impact de la pand\u00e9mie de coronavirus (COVID-19) sur l'activation de codes d'alerte correspondant aux AVC dans un service des urgences mais aussi sur la prise en charge de patients dans une unit\u00e9 de soins de l'AVC et sur leur aiguillage vers une clinique de pr\u00e9vention des AVC situ\u00e9e dans le centre r\u00e9gional de traitement des AVC de London en Ontario. \u00c0 noter que cet \u00e9tablissement dessert une population d'environ 1,8 million d'habitants. Imm\u00e9diatement apr\u00e8s que les premiers cas de coronavirus (COVID-19) eurent \u00e9t\u00e9 officiellement confirm\u00e9s, nous avons constat\u00e9 en 2020 une baisse de 20 % du codage en lien avec des AVC par rapport \u00e0 l'ann\u00e9e 2019.

Nos r\u00e9sultats sugg\u00e8rent donc que la diminution du codage en lien avec des AVC peut s'expliquer principalement par des facteurs li\u00e9s aux patients eux-m\u00eames, par exemple la crainte d'\u00eatre expos\u00e9 au coronavirus, tandis que la diminution du nombre de cas adress\u00e9s \u00e0 des sp\u00e9cialistes peut s'expliquer en grande partie par les politiques de ce centre hospitalier et les mesures de confinement des autorit\u00e9s responsables.",

We, therefore, assessed the impact of the coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic on code stroke activations in the ED, stroke unit admissions, and referrals to the urgent stroke prevention clinic at London Health Sciences Center University Hospital's regional stroke center, serving a captive population of 1.8 million in Ontario, Canada.",

The exposure was the COVID-19 pandemic. We quantified the number of code strokes in 12 World Health Organization (WHO) epidemiological weeks between February 3, 2020, and April 26, 2020, by interrogating the hospital's wireless paging system database. We chose February 3, 2020, as the start date of the study period because it was the first Monday after the COVID-19 case was confirmed in London on Friday January 31, 2020. This was the third confirmed case in Ontario. The study period started on a Monday because this is the first day of WHO epidemiological weeks and it also allows for mitigating the bias of weekdays vs. weekend consults. We used the same WHO epidemiological weeks of 2019 as a comparator. We compared epidemiological weeks of 2020 vs. 2019. These are matched weeks in both years, which are used for mitigating the bias of seasonal variations in stroke consults. Code strokes included patients brought to the ED by the Emergency Medical Services and walk-in strokes. Additionally, we quantified hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke admissions to the stroke unit and referrals to the urgent stroke prevention clinic during the same period by reviewing the London Ontario Stroke Registry, the inpatient census, and London Health Sciences Centre's electronic booking system. The stroke registry is updated on a real-time basis. Clinic referrals consist of patients with minor strokes or transient ischemic attacks (TIAs). On March 16, 2020, the Government of Ontario implemented a provincial lockdown advising Ontarians to avoid gatherings of over 50 people, and the closure of recreational libraries, private schools (public schools were closed on March 12), daycares, churches and other faith settings, and all bars and restaurants. On the same day, after a provincial order requesting all hospitals to implement pandemic plans by ramping down nonemergent clinical activities, the hospital implemented a service reduction policy. This resulted in the immediate transition of most outpatient clinics to telemedicine systems. On March 23, 2020, the Provincial Government expanded the lockdown by ordering the mandatory closure of all nonessential workplaces and the enhancement of social distancing.",

In case of no differences between both types of models, we opted for the parsimonious Poisson model. The number of code strokes, stroke unit admissions, and urgent stroke prevention clinic referrals were the outcome of interest in their respective models. We designed the models to test if there were effects attributable to the year (2019 vs. 2020) as a surrogate of the COVID-19 pandemic or to the provincial lockdown on the weekly number of cases. ",

It is also possible that patients with TIAs or very mild strokes (so that they do not qualify for either code strokes or for admission) decided to stay at home and not seek medical attention.
