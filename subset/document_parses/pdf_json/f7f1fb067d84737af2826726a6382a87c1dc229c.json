To smooth this challenge, IoT emerges as an encouraging paradigm because it provides the scalability required for this purpose, supporting continuous and reliable health monitoring on a global scale. Based on this context, an IoT-based healthcare platform to provide remote monitoring for patients in a critical situation was proposed in the authors' previous works. Therefore, this paper aims to extend the platform by integrating wearable and unobtrusive sensors to monitor patients with coronavirus disease. Furthermore, we report a real deployment of our approach in an intensive care unit for COVID-19 patients in Brazil.",

These wearable solutions can be used in clothes, pulse (like watches), epidermal thermal sensors, or breathing belts. Smartwatches are also presented as wearable sensors to provide blood pressure monitoring. Simultaneously, small patches can be used specifically to monitor temperature and cough with the aid of smartphone applications (using its microphone).

Several patients have already been monitored by PAR, and data from different sensors were collected without the need for any changes to the platform. The implanted solution is capable of automatically obtaining the data collected by the different sensors that monitor the patients, enabling better working conditions for the clinical team, lower costs for the hospital and better assistance for people who are hospitalized.",
