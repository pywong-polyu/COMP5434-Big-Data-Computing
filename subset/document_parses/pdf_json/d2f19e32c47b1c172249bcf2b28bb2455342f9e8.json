The emergency physician performed a bedside ultrasound that demonstrated normal contractility and a moderate pericardial effusion. His neck veins were not distended. His C-reactive protein was elevated at 97.6 mg / L and d-dimer was 2173 ng / mL; the ECG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm but decreased amplitude. (Fig. 1 right panel) Computed tomography confirmed a pericardial effusion but no other pathology. The admitting cardiologist reported a friction rub, and along with his characteristic pain, the new effusion, the elevated C-reactive protein, the timing of his symptoms, as well as the lack of any other inciting traumatic, procedural, infectious, or inflammatory cause, he was diagnosed with pericarditis related to mRNA-1273 SARS CoV-2 vaccination. He was admitted overnight, and the cardiology team halted anticoagulation, initiated non-steroidal anti-inflammatories, and discharged him uneventfully the next morning. At two weeks, he had mild dyspnea and a follow-up echocardiogram demonstrated a much smaller effusion. At 6-and 12-week follow-ups, he was symptom-free.",

In complex cases, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or endocardial biopsy may be warranted [3] . The majority of diagnoses are considered probable and founded on history, physical examination, biomarkers, and non-invasive imaging. However, confirmation requires biopsy and histologic assessment [3] . The illness is reportable to Public Health [3] . Importantly, most patients can be safely discharged home without incident; even patients who are admitted typically only remain for a single day [1] . Treatment is largely supportive, and no specific management is currently recommended [3] . It is presently unclear whether such patients should avoid an mRNA vaccination or opt for a non-mRNA vaccination instead [3] . However, given that SARS-CoV2 infection (COVID-19) can cause myocarditis and pericarditis at far higher rates than mRNA vaccines, as well as heart failure, arrhythmias, myocardial infarction, and thromboembolic events, the risks of infection must be weighed against the risks of vaccination [3] .",

Only one patient has been reported with post-vaccination atrial fibrillation-a 30-year-old male with Marfan's syndrome several days post coronary artery bypass grafting who received mRNA vaccination and developed atrial fibrillation a week later- [2] a situation very different than our patient. Since post-vaccination atrial fibrillation appears to be exceedingly rare, we cannot endorse that all patients with new or deteriorating atrial fibrillation require extensive investigations for potential underlying causes. However, in new atrial fibrillation patients who have had a recent mRNA vaccination, and especially in those who present with chest discomfort or dyspnea, cardiac inflammation including myocarditis and pericarditis [1] are both potential diagnoses with a small but noteworthy possibility of serious complications. Physicians should consider physical examination maneuvers, such as auscultation for a friction rub, careful assessment of neck veins, or ascertainment of pulsus paradoxus. Importantly, physicians can attempt low-barrier diagnostics such as a bedside ultrasound [5] . These tests are rapid, inexpensive, and can be performed nearly any environment with minimal patient inconvenience.",
