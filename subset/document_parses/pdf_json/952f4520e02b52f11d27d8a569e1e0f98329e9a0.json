On 1 February Healthcare 2021, 9, 1220 2 of 15 2020, the Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) reported the first COVID-19 mortality outside of China [5] . Southeast Asia (SE Asia or SEA) is composed of 11 sovereign states, which are divided into three groups geographically: mainland SEA (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam), maritime SEA (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Timor-Leste), and Singapore as a junction point. As a regional unit, it not only borders China but also lies at \"crossroads of the world\" due to important maritime trade routes [6] . To control the pandemic, ASEAN (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) countries generally took similar intervention measures but there were differences in the spread, burden, and medical capacities [7] . In the context of globalization, regional disease surveillance is essential because it contributes to the formulation of responses to such emerging infectious diseases [8] . Capturing the baseline transmission characteristics of novel coronavirus in specific social contexts is strategic for programming public health interventions [9] .",

Primary data sources were the official websites of the WHO and the public health authorities (such as the Ministries of Health or Centers for Disease Control) in relevant countries. We included individuals with a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for SARS-CoV-2 (n = 1346). An Excel spreadsheet database was created through data compilation and used for analyses. First, we illustrated the temporal and spatial distributions of the COVID-19 outbreak in Southeast Asia and further detected the potential spatiotemporal cluster(s). Then, a simple mathematical model for the growth of confirmed cases was established based on the temporal distributions and subsequently applied to the short-term trend analyses. Finally, we described the demographic characteristics of infected individuals and further identified the probable risk factors for morbidity and mortality. Additionally, the perspective of subregional comparison was adopted throughout the study to reveal internal differences.",

Additionally, data of actual case counts in the subsequent 35 days (17 March 2020-20 April 2020) were collected. We only compiled individual-level data for 925 cases that tested positive for COVID-19 since health authorities in Malaysia and Indonesia did not disclose relevant details after 13 March 2020, which resulted in a reduction in the sample size for demographic analysis. General population data at the national level (including population size, median age, and sex ratio) were extracted from World Population Prospects 2019 (United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs) and the World Bank Open Data. Human Development Index (HDI) data at the national level were extracted from Human Development Report 2020 published by the United Nations Development Programme.

Epidemic curves and semilogarithmic graphs were constructed by the report date using Microsoft Excel 2019 (Microsoft, Redwoods, WA, USA). The burden of disease was measured at the regional, subregional, and national levels by cumulative incidence (per 1,000,000 population). The spatial distribution of confirmed cases was illustrated with marked maps, using R software version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). We also assessed the age, sex, and nationality of individuals with COVID-19 and those who died of it. Demographic data were expressed as median (interquartile range, IQR) or n (%), as appropriate. Crude recovery or fatality rates were calculated based on the reported cumulative counts. An exponential regression model was constructed to estimate short-term incidence trends using SPSS statistical software version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA), and then we tested the statistical significance by the analysis of variance (ANOVA) and evaluated the goodness-of-fit with the adjusted R-square. To further evaluate the modeling effect as well as the trend change, a comparative analysis was performed between the predicted counts and the actual counts for the subsequent 35 days.",

In the study, based on the time series of COVID-19 new case counts, R 0 was estimated by the maximum likelihood (ML) method using the R 0 package in R software version 3.6.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) [15] .

Given the fact that the region is generally tropical, the uneven patterns of epidemic diffusion were likely to be determined by the diverse sociodemographic situations. The Human Development Index or HDI is a statistic composite that measures three key dimensions of human development: life expectancy, education, and per capita income [20] . On a global scale, the HDI was found to have a positive association with reported case counts in the early stages of COVID-19 pandemic [21, 22] . According to the Human Development Report 2020, Singapore, Brunei, and Malaysia all have very high HDI, while the CLMV countries (Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam) belonging to mainland Southeast Asia have the lowest within the region [23] . Therefore, our observations based on Southeast Asia supported HDI as an early predictor of reported COVID-19 diffusion. Learning from the experience of SARS in 2003, Singapore developed a hierarchical disease outbreak response system and accordingly took a timely and coordinated response to this COVID-19 outbreak [24] . Despite the disadvantages such as the extremely high population density and globalization level [21, 25] , a series of public health interventions adopted by Singapore in the early stage effectively slowed down the spread of the pandemic, which can be reflected in its relatively flat epidemic curve and the significantly lower R 0 . The sharply rising epidemic curves and the abnormally high transmission dynamic estimates exposed some potential problems in the early responses of maritime Southeast Asian countries. As of mid-March 2020, Indonesia and the Philippines (with populations of over 100 million) both had extremely limited testing capacity which was less than 450 tests per day [26, 27] . Undertesting can not only cover up the true severity of the pandemic, but also cause hidden dangers for the outbreaks in community settings.",

Five studies reported R 0 estimates for the COVID-19 outbreak in China, with a range of 2.47-2.68 [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] . The overall R 0 of 2.51 in Southeast Asia fell in the same range, indicating a comparable transmissibility to that in China. Our study observed a similar exponential growth trend, which was applied to the prediction of a short-term incidence trend for COVID-19 within the region. The goodness-of-fit (adjusted R 2 ) of the prediction model within the second phase of transmission was 0.96. Although the exponential growth model also fit the early epidemic patterns of COVID-19 in some other regions like Europe and Africa, the estimates of the relevant parameters in the model varied from each other [33, 34] . This phenomenon could be related to different climatic conditions, genetic backgrounds, and sufficiency of health resources (especially detection capabilities). Our model predicted that the cumulative COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia would exceed 10,000 by early April 2020. The cumulative number of COVID-19 patients in Southeast Asia was 10,153 as of 1 April 2020. This actual figure validates our prediction. Despite the effectiveness of short-term forecasts, we observed that actual case counts reported since Day 85 (6 April 2020) have gradually exceeded the lower limit of prediction. It is worth noting that Malaysia, which was the hardest hit in Southeast Asia at that time, implemented the Movement Control Order (MCO) nationwide on 18 March 2020 [35] . Thus, we speculate that the implementation of more stringent precautions may be a vital reason for the slowdown in cumulative case growth.",

            "text": "Geo-temporal maps illustrated the spatial distribution of early COVID-19 cases in Southeast Asia. Most of the confirmed cases were concentrated within several international metropolitan areas before spreading to smaller settlements. Many studies have demonstrated the link between transportation (especially air travel) and the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection [36, 37] . This seems to explain why metropolises, which are major international transportation hubs, experience higher exposure to outbreaks in the context of a pandemic. Diffusion theory in geography provides a conceptual framework for us to understand and summarize the spatial spread patterns of emerging infectious diseases. There are three basic types of diffusion: (1) spread outward from a source is called expansion diffusion, usually affecting adjacent spaces; (2) spread over a large distance is called relocation diffusion, often coming with migration, and (3) spread following a certain spatial hierarchy is called hierarchical diffusion [38] . Linka et al. identified the early spatial pattern of COVID-19 outbreak in Europe, which was characterized by relocation diffusion based on mobility networks [39] . Fortaleza et al. observed two patterns of early COVID-19 dispersion in Brazil: the expansion diffusion from the capital metropolitan area, and the hierarchical diffusion between S\u00e3o Paulo city and cities of regional relevance [40] . In this study, we found that the outbreak of COVID-19 in Southeast Asia, macroscopically, had experienced a spatial pattern shift, which was from relocation diffusion to hierarchical diffusion. This finding underscores the public health implications of travel restriction in reducing the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the spatiotemporal scanning, Malaysia as the center, along with Singapore, had formed the most likely spatiotemporal cluster of COVID-19 incidence in Southeast Asia since early March 2020, and the corresponding aggregation risk was 72.07 times that of the rest. This could be supported by the results of our previous phylogeographical study using genomic data [41] . Notably, the spread of the virus between neighboring countries is more in line with the spatial pattern of expansion diffusion.",

On the African \"Tropical Continent\", the COVID-19 outbreak was detected approximately one month later than that in Southeast Asia, and the first confirmed cases were primarily imported from Europe rather than mainland China [42] . This initial difference may be attributed to differentiated geo-relations and migration flows. Similar geographical variations in the early epidemic pattern could also be observed in the African region, highlighting that the burden of COVID-19 in North Africa was higher than that in sub-Saharan Africa [43] , and the latter has a lower HDI level. Temporally, an abrupt exponential growth of African case counts emerged in the last week of March 2020 as the virus spread locally [43] . On the western edge of the Eurasian \"World Island\", all 27 member states of the European Union (EU) were affected by COVID-19 within only 45 days [44] . Meanwhile, the outbreak dynamics of COVID-19 in Europe revealed multiple regional epicenters (involving France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) with exponential growth rates > 0.22/day [39, 45] . Compared to Southeast Asia, Europe's more rapid and extensive dispersal of COVID-19 was likely to be driven by deeper regional integration and looser travel restrictions.",

This reinforces the previous finding that COVID-19 seems to be uncommon in children [46, 47] . In terms of sex, the reported proportion of males in confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, Italy, and South Korea was 51.4%, 59.8%, and 37.7%, respectively [48] [49] [50] . Although more than half of the confirmed cases in Southeast Asia were male, the link between sex and COVID-19 susceptibility was not supported by the result of our corresponding hypothesis test. Moreover, participation in social activities may be considered an intermediary factor [46, 50] . Interestingly, the age and sex composition of confirmed cases in Vietnam were unique in that many more young and female individuals were infected with COVID-19.",

For example, the number of deaths from COVID-19 in Indonesia jumped from five on 16 March 2020 to 19 on 18 March 2020, thus increasing the crude fatality rate to 8.4% [53] . Although most COVID-19 patients may exhibit mild clinical symptoms, older people and individuals with underlying medical conditions may be at increased risk of suffering severe illness and death. Our study results are consistent with this finding [48, 50] . The median age of the 18 deaths included in the study was significantly higher than that of surviving cases. Accordingly, the high fatality rate observed for early COVID-19 in the Philippines may be related to the relatively high median age of those infected. Of the COVID-19 patients who died, 72.2% had underlying conditions, such as diabetes and chronic cardiovascular diseases. Notably, one deceased case from Thailand also had dengue fever [54] , a tropical disease that is common and active in Southeast Asia.

By mid-2021, a new wave of COVID-19 outbreaks associated with the Delta variant (B.1.617.2), which had originated in India, began to sweep through Southeast Asia [58] . A recent study demonstrated an exponential growth of daily new cases and a significant subregional heterogeneity in the lineage composition in Southeast Asia from March 2021 to June 2021 [59] . Regarding the COVID-19 burden, as of 20 July 2021, countries with a cumulative incidence of more than 1000 cases per 100,000 population in the region were among the maritime Southeast Asian countries (the highest was 2903 in Malaysia) [60] . Longitudinal comparisons reflected a degree of continuity in the spatiotemporal patterns of the COVID-19 pandemic in Southeast Asia. In addition, expansion diffusion seems to have an unignorable impact on the current spread of COVID-19, especially given the noteworthy increase in cross-border imported cases from Myanmar which is under political unrest [59, 61] . Thus, travel restrictions (including border controls) remain to be necessary strategies to deal with the prevalence of emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants based on the les-sons from the early stages of the pandemic. Although several studies have confirmed the effectiveness of current vaccines against certain variants [62, 63] , the harsh reality is that vaccination coverage is far from the required herd immunity level in most parts of Southeast Asia [60] . Taking full account of the demographic risk factors that affect the susceptibility and severity of viral infections, prioritizing vulnerable populations such as the elderly could become a strategic choice in immunization programming.",

First, raw data were compiled from publicly available information, which was not equally available across the countries included in the study. Therefore, the data available for the overall analysis and sample size for demographic analysis were limited. Moreover, due to the delay in the diagnosis of COVID-19 infections and lack of transparency in the provided information, the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths may not have been comprehensively reported during the early phase of transmission. This may have resulted in an underestimation of the true severity of the outbreak in this region. Finally, evolving health policies and opportunistic factors make it difficult to predict pandemic trends. We used a simple and practical model to make short-term predictions of COVID-19 incidence trends in the study region.",

Analyses of spatiotemporal distribution characteristics indicated that the region's COVID-19 situation was challenging and unevenly geographically distributed. At the national level, early disease burden was positively correlated with Human Development Index. Advanced age may play a significant role in increasing susceptibility to COVID-19 infection and can lead to severe clinical outcomes. Early transmission dynamics generally obeyed the law of exponential growth, whereas phase shifts subsequently occurred under the influence of interventions. Consequently, there is an urgent need to strengthen epidemic surveillance and improve resource allocation for combatting the pandemic. ",
