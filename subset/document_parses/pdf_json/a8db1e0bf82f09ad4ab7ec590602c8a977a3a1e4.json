Therefore, we aimed to investigate the quality of life (QoL) of COVID-19 positive patients after recovery in Bangladesh. This was a study of adult (aged \ufffd18 years) COVID-19 individuals from eight divisions of Bangladesh diagnosed and confirmed by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) from June 2020 to November 2020. Given a response rate of 60% in a pilot study, a random list of 6400 COVID-19 patients was generated to recruit approximately 3200 patients from eight divisions of Bangladesh and finally a total of 3244 participants could be recruited for the current study. The validated Bangla version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) questionnaire was used to assess the QoL. Data were analyzed by STATA (Version 16.1) and R (Version 4.0.0). All the procedures were conducted following ethical approval and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The mean scores of QoL were highest for the physical domain (68.25 \u00b114.45) followed by social (65.10\u00b115.78), psychological (63.28\u00b115.48), and environmental domain (62.77\u00b113.07). Psychological and physical domain scores among females were significantly lower than the males (p<0.001). The overall quality of life was lower in persons having a chronic disease. Participants over 45 years of age were 52% less likely to enjoy good physical health than the participants aged below 26 years (AOR: 0.48, CI: 0.28-0.82). The quality of life of employed participants was found 1.8 times higher than the unemployed (AOR: 1.80, CI: 1.11-2.91). Those who were admitted to hospitals during infection had a low QoL score in physical, psychological, and socials domains. However, QoL improved in all aspect except the psychological domain for each day passed after the diagnosis. These",

Clinical recovery was defined as passing 14 days after initial positive test for asymptomatic patients, complete absence of fever, cough, shortness of breath for at least 3 days for mild to moderate pneumonia patients, and discharge with advice from the hospital for severe or critical patients. Persons who were currently being treated for COVID-19, children (<18 years), pregnant women and critically ill were excluded from the study. The list of available COVID-19 positive patients was obtained, after formal written approval, from Civil Surgeon's (CS) offices of the relevant districts of all eight divisions of Bangladesh. According to the Institute of Epidemiology and Disease Control and Research (IEDCR), a total of 302907 patients had been tested positive until 4November 2020 in Bangladesh. Among them 167499 in Dhaka division (level two administrative zone of Bangladesh), 48785 in Chattogram, 21126 in Rajshahi, 12947 in Rangpur, 22990 in Khulna, 6784 in Mymensingh, 13758 in Sylhet, and 9018 in Barisal divisions [14] . A research team consisting of 27 members prepared a structured questionnaire. We conducted a pilot survey on 100 post COVID-19 individuals selected randomly from the sampling frame to test the questionnaire. We found that the response rate was around 60% (due to call drop, call waiting, inactive number, network problem, and refusal to give an interview). From the opinion of statistical experts, we intended to interview at least 200 post COVID-19 patients from each of the urban and rural stratums (16 stratums for 8 divisions) and thus intended sample size appeared to be a total of 3200 patients which was roughly 1% of the total population of COVID-19 patients for 8 divisions. However, as there was no prior information about residence status, whether the patients were from urban or rural, of the COVID-19 patients, simply we targeted to collect information on 400 patients from each division. As the pilot survey, conducted with a view to testing the questionnaire, showed that there around 60% non-response, we increased our target sample to 6400 to reach our goal of 3200 patients. A list of randomly selected COVID-19 positive patients (where randomization was accomplished through statistical programming software R version 4.0.0) from each of the divisions was supplied to the data collection team. The data collection team could approach 4584 patients because 1332 individuals declined to participate, 466 individuals did not receive the calls, and 18 patients were dead at the time of interview, hence, were excluded ultimately. Thus, the data collection team successfully completed the interview of 3244 COVID-19 recovered patients. The survey was conducted from 16 November 2020 to 17 January 2021 including the pilot testing.",

The WHOQOL-BREF is the most widely used generic QoL assessment tool across the globe. This moderately sized (25 items) instrument covers the whole range of QoL deficits, has a simple response format, but allows fine-grained discrimination of QoL across individuals.

Categorical variables were described by frequencies (percent), and chi-square tests were used to identify associations between groups.

All tests were two-tailed and p-values less than or equal to 0.05 were considered statistically significant. The internal consistency of QoL scores, measured by the WHO-QOL-BREF instrument, was checked by Cronbach's alpha coefficient. QoL scores were transformed into binary scores by considering a score greater or equal to 50 as 1 (\"good\"), otherwise as 0 (\"poor\") to implement a binary logistic regression whereby identifying influencing factors for quality of life.

Those who contracted COVID-19 had to endure the highest suffering. Therefore, we aimed to assess QoL of people who recovered from this disease. Our study reports primary findings on quality of life (QoL) among the largest nationally representative sample of COVID-19 recovered people. Overall, participants' perception about their quality of life was just above neutral (Q1 3.5 \u00b10.81). This trend was also reflected in the four domains of QoL explored in our study. The mean values of physical, psychological, social, and environmental domain scores were between 60 to 70, indicating an average score at the upper half of the total. The physical domain had the highest average score, followed by social relationship, psychological, and environmental domains, in decreasing order. Nevertheless, these scores indicate an overall good QoL. The initial finding is comparable to the health-related quality of life (HRQoL) of COVID-19 patients after recovery in China, assessed at the beginning of the pandemic. The study conducted by Chen et al. [12] found that COVID-19 patients' average physical component score was just above median (55.96 \u00b17.24), and psychological domain score was just below median (48.92 \u00b110.81) one-month after recovery. However, they also noted, both domain scores were significantly lower compared to population norms. The authors used the Short-Form 36-item (SF-36) questionnaire [18] , which measures predominantly HRQoL while the WHOQOL-BREF score tends to measure global QoL [19] . Similarly, Jacobs et al. [20] reported a low QoL score of COVID-19 patients 35 days after hospitalization, measured by PROMIS1 instrument. A comparison of severely affected COVID-19 patients' QoL in Spain, before and after infection, revealed a statistically significant reduction in QoL at six months [21] . All these studies suggest a considerable change in the quality of life of COVID-19 patients.",

Additionally, those living in semi-urban areas were less likely to have a good psychological score. Rural-urban differences in QoL are multifactorial and vary from region to region. In the developed world, rural areas have much lower QoL than urban areas [26] . This could be true for developing countries, but a high population density and pollution levels in the urban areas might also negatively affect the subjective QoL in these regions [27] . Besides, a lack of green space can trigger a decline in health in urban areas [27] . This also makes sense when we consider that our subjects recovered from a highly infectious airborne respiratory disease.",

He noted that higher educational attainment is generally linked to better occupational prospects and higher income, hence having a positive effect on a person's quality of life. This finding is also supported by our observation that service holders were significantly more likely to have good psychological QoL than the unemployed participants. During the aftermath of COVID-19, higher-educated people might have maintained personal and social links better than others within the economic and social constraints of the new reality.",

Physical QoL significantly increases with income category [29] possibly because it increases affordability, imparts a sense of security, and is generally associated with higher education. However, subjective well-being is not linearly associated with income and is often dependent on a complex interaction of socio-cultural and environmental factors [30] . This might explain why we saw a decrease in the psychological domain of QoL among COVID-19 recovered participants who had a high monthly family income.",

In the setting of COVID-19, ex-smokers' increased self-esteem, developed from their prior experience of behavioral change, might have drove them to an improved sense of well-being compared to never-smokers.

On univariate analysis, the overall domain scores were found significantly lower among those having a chronic disease. But compared to other comorbidities, the Q1 score was above the median in persons having HTN and diabetes, and poor in persons having Asthma/COPD, CKD, and cancer. All of these findings are supported by previous studies conducted among non-COVID persons [33] [34] [35] [36] . Besides, we know that chronic diseases in COVID-19 patients can lead to increased disease severity, poor prognosis, and increased mortality [37] .
