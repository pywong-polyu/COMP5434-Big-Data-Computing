Clinical hallmarks include fever, rash, conjunctivitis, distal extremity edema, mucous membrane changes, shock, and high inflammatory markers [5, 6] . This has been called multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) [7] . The mean age of children diagnosed with MIS-C is 8-9 years [6, 7] . Less common is multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults (MIS-A) [8] -a syndrome that can include cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and dermatologic manifestations. Numerous dermatological findings have been described in association with COVID-19 ranging from chilblains, petechiae, purpura, maculopapular rash, and urticaria [9] .

Dermatology was consulted and felt his rash was consistent with a viral exanthem. Other etiologies were considered given the marked acral erythema, but additional infectious tests returned negative (see Table 1 ). We reviewed potential culprit medications that could cause drug rash and considered drug rash with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms, but felt this diagnosis to be unlikely given the rapid time course and atypical appearance. He was treated with supportive measures including antihistamines and topical steroids.

Here, we present an atypical case of COVID-19 in an adult, characterized by a paucity of respiratory symptoms, significant systemic inflammation, and a diffuse rash. Our patient had evidence of systemic inflammation (marked leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory biomarkers) and multi-organ injury: cardiac (elevated troponin), skin (extensive rash), hepatic (mild transaminitis), and pulmonary (mild hypoxemia). The elevation of CRP to several hundred is higher than what is typically described in adults with COVID-19 (10-30 mg/L in the average adult case [10] , with an average of 50-100 mg/L described in critically ill patients) [11] . Although he was empirically treated for CAP prior to arrival at our hospital, his mild respiratory symptoms and lack of significant parenchymal abnormalities on chest CT argue against a bacterial coinfection as a driver of his elevated inflammatory biomarkers.

Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as the abdominal pain and diarrhea experienced by our patient, are common [16] . Severe systemic inflammation, including various mucocutaneous findings, have been more recently described in adults [17, 18] . How infection with SARS-CoV-2 leads to multisystem inflammation in both children and adults remains unclear. Hypotheses include the stimulation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes, as well as a marked cytokine release causing a hyperimmune, dysregulated host response to infection [19] .",
