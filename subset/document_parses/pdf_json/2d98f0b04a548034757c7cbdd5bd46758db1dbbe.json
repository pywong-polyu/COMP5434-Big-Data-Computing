However, using healthcare data for secondary purposes raises legal and ethical concerns relating to confidentiality, privacy and data protection rights. Using a linkage and anonymisation approach that processes data lawfully and in line with ethical best practice to create an anonymous (non-personal) dataset can address these concerns, yet there is no set approach for defining all of the steps involved in such data flow end-to-end. We aimed to define such an approach with clear steps for dataset creation, and to describe its utilisation in a case study linking healthcare data.",

Data capture in discrete, 'siloed' systems renders the necessity of data linkage in research. However, linkage brings issues, such as how to handle varied data structures and maintain data security while enabling appropriate access [1] . Ethical and legal requirements may necessitate complex processes in data handling, which may be burdensome [2, 3] . In the European Union, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) sets conditions for the lawful processing of personal and \"special category\" data that relates to an identified / identifiable individual [4] . In the UK, the Data Protection Act 2018 and common law duty of confidentiality apply [5, 6] . To disclose confidential information, collected during healthcare delivery, for secondary use in research, requires a legal gateway such as consent, public interest, a legal obligation or approval by the UK Secretary of State for Health [7] . Unprecedented rates of data sharing in response to the current pandemic are yielding important insights into COVID-19, however it is uncertain how this might change the landscape for all research [8, 9] . Further, there remains public concern, and weaknesses in public engagement, to overcome [10] [11] [12] .",

A clear and practical process is needed to link datasets and create a research dataset that is no longer considered confidential or personal. Data linkage and anonymisation procedures can be used to create an irreversibly linked, nonpersonal, dataset from two or more identifiable sources. Data are linked and the relationship between individuals and data are removed so that it is beyond reasonable effort to identify individuals from the data [20] . Anonymisation approaches include the removal of direct identifiers and information that is rare (either by itself or in combination with other information) [21] . Data is reduced in granularity to reduce the risk of sharing identifiable or identifying information, which can be checked using disclosure control tools such as QAMyData [22] , though there may be a trade-off with utility.",

            "text": "Linkage and anonymisation procedures can be applied by data providers ('at-source') or \"trusted third parties\", although each has potential practical and security limitations. At-source linkage generally occurs where the source holds multiple datasets and the approval necessary to perform such linkage. It prevents identifying data from crossing organisational boundaries, however this also prevents authorised linkage between datasets held by multiple sourceswhich is often required in research. At-source research platforms have developed recently to facilitate rapid COVID-19 research, but the long-term funding and sustainability of such approaches is uncertain [23] . Alternatively, a third party may receive identifiable data to link and anonymise. In the UK, the National Data Guardian recommends that a \"safe-haven\" performs this role, acting as an \"honest broker\" [24, 25] . The NHS Digital linkage service [26] is suitable for health data that is identifiable or carries a risk of re-identification through reasonable means [25] . In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, key UK funders have worked to increase research scale and infrastructure, enabling access to National Core Data assets through Trusted Research Environments (TREs), to enable COVID-19 research [27] . However, the transfer of personal data to a third party for linkage and anonymisation carries the risk of disclosure. It may also be legally restricted by the purposes for which the data was collected, as a legal reason (such as public interest during the COVID-19 pandemic) is required for third party processing of personal data. Further, nationally funded third parties may focus efforts on datasets commonly required for core research, which would not address all research requirements. Pseudonymisation approaches that de-couple data from identifying information while maintaining a link between these that is accessible only by authorised parties [28, 29] offer a means to enable authorised data linkage. In pseudonymisation, directly identifying data that would otherwise be used in linkage can be replaced with a \"digest\" (linkable pseudonym) [30] . Recognised hashing algorithms such as SHA-2 and SHA-3 can be implemented in software such as Python or OpenPseudonymiser, to generate linkage digests from data strings, while affine cipher-based encryption may be suitable for image data [31] [32] [33] [34] . These digests are anonymous in the context of the recipient. However, the data provider can link reversible pseudonyms back to an individual, so they remain classed as personal data [4, 29] . An approach whereby the digest is re-pseudonymised by the recipient [31] , prevents backward-engineering or re-identification of the digests by any single party. However, the digests retain their status as personal data. Multiparty cryptographic protocols, such as garbled circuit approaches, can aim to prevent data linkage reversibility, but are computationally expensive [35, 36] .",

The data flow protocol received ethical approval from the HRA REC (IRAS project ID 188345 REC reference 16/NE/0155) and was approved by the data providers and the third party. Informed patient consent was not sought as the data were analysed anonymously.

The CAG determined that approval under the National Health Service Act Section 251 was not required given these factors, following assurance from the data providers on the at-source anonymisation procedures applied [42] . The third party sought review of the proposal by the Queen's Counsel.

The research team provided the data providers with standard operating procedures to ensure a standardised approach. The Caldicott Guardian of one provider produced an encrypted project-specific \"salt\" file via the OpenPseudonymiser website [31] and shared this with the analyst team in both organisations. The salt was code created using Open-Pseudonymiser from a project-specific alphanumeric string. Digests only matched where they are created using the same identifiers (in the same format) and salt, which prevents unauthorised linkage. The analysts combined the project salt with the agreed patient identifiable inputs and used OpenPseudonymiser to produce linkable pseudonymous digests using the secure hash algorithm (SHA-256) [31] . These were encrypted and provided to the DAT using a secure file transfer protocol (SFTP). A designated analyst produced a list of matches and returned these to the providers before locally destroying the received and matched files. The providers produced data for this linked cohort, using the project's data items list. The data providers additionally applied their standard anonymisation processes prior to data transfer, such as replacing postcodes with sectorlevel postcode or the corresponding Index of Multiple Deprivation score [45] .",

A DAT analyst then linked the extracts and performed other transformations to produce the anonymous research dataset. The transformations aimed to address the risk of re-identification inherent in data linkage by undertaking data minimisation steps, such as replacing the patient's month and year of birth with an age-band and converting dated diagnostic data into a binary indicator of prevalence within specific time-frames. This helped to avoid the risk of the linked dataset containing \"digital fingerprints\" [46] . The processing applied to some common data types are listed in Table 1 . Controlled research data access was provided to researchers over a University network under a user agreement detailing their data processing obligations. This included sanctioning against any attempts at re-identification. Access in a project-specific, firewalled environment in compliance with the NHS DSPT [47] was contingent upon providing evidence of completing annual training in advanced information security.

The protocol utilised OpenPseudonymiser, as an open source application for converting an input field into digests using the Secure Hash Algorithm 2 [31, 48] . The data providers agreed on the direct identifiers and a salt to be used to create linkable digests. The inputs were formatted using an agreed approach. Following the protocol, the data providers transferred these digests to a third party who advised on the matching digests, for which records the data providers each produced a dataset with pseudonymous digests. Upon receiving these datasets, the third party re-pseudonymised the digests using a unique salt that was then destroyed to render the digests anonymous, and linked the datasets using the new digests. The third party performed further transformations to ensure the anonymisation of the merged dataset. All data transfers were in encrypted format. These steps are detailed in Table 2 and a template version of the data flow protocol, which defines the data flow and technical procedure, and provides a supporting glossary and worked examples of the pseudonymisation approach (S1 File).",

A separation of duties procedure allocated the data handling functions in the data flow protocol to specific parties to ensure separation of the pseudonymisation and anonymisation steps and to define the digests handled by each party. Two organisations undertook the data provision: LTHT and TPP, as described in the Methods.

LTHT identified 102,763 patients with a cancer diagnosis, defined either via clinical review (\"gold standard\") or through the recorded cancer status, ICD-10 code, and definitive disease phase, and 287,564 matched non-cancer patients (Fig 2) . TPP provided digests for the ResearchOne database (approximately 8 million). The DAT in LIDA, independent of the research team, identified 140,462 matching digests.

The protocol is made available to inform other projects, so that it may facilitate access to datasets and data-based research.

Ethical data handling is particularly crucial for personal healthcare data and so we have exemplified the process with a case-study linking and anonymising such data.

The CPR dataset has been incorporated as an exemplar research dataset by DATA-CAN, the Health Data Research Hub for Cancer in the UK [49] . The data flow protocol has already been adopted locally by projects including the Yorkshire Specialist Register of Cancer in Children and Young People [50] .

This approach brings advantages without compromising either matching accuracy or computer processing time, as would be the case with cryptographic approaches such as garbled circuits to complete linkage at scale [35] . It reduces the risk of information disclosure by external attack, as the linked research dataset does not link back to digests held by the data providers. Two salts are used to produce the digests and no party holds both, as would be required for digest re-identification. Even in the case of malicious attack, it is not reasonable to anticipate digest re-identification in comparison with some honest broker approaches [53] . Anonymisation using a third party and a separation of duties procedure prevents data or digest identification through collusion between the data providers and research team, providing protection above pseudonymisation approaches. The digest anonymisation approach used strengthens the linkage process, although it must be coupled with processes that mitigate the risk of identification through the rest of the dataset (i.e. data that is shared but not used in the linkage process). Such processes should be selected to ensure that data are anonymous beyond reasonable effort, while maintaining wherever possible the dataset utility in relation to addressing the research question [19] . A party, e.g. the data provider or third party, must apply these processes under the appropriate consent and legal frameworks. The protocol acknowledges that data linkage may necessitate further assessment of risk and post-linkage anonymisation or aggregation steps, to produce a research dataset that is richer than unlinked data while being practically protected from internal disclosure of information. As part of a governance framework, including data access limitations (including prevention of concurrent access to auxiliary information), processing agreements and pre-dissemination disclosure review, the approach in the data flow protocol can assist in preventing unauthorised attempts at re-identification [30, 54, 55] .",

The case study employed a third party that acted independent of the research team but was within the same organisation (University of Leeds), which minimised the data disclosure risks inherent in otherwise involving further organisations in data handling. The third party contributed to secure data flow by verifying the involved parties and reviewing the approvals in place for data handling [17] . Alternative approaches to party verification could be considered, alongside or instead of this being performed by a third party [56] . In the case study, the cancer status of patients as defined using hospital data was not shared with the GP and community data provider owing to the inclusion of non-cancer patients. As almost all patients in the UK are registered with a GP, we believe that linkage did not provide the hospital data provider with additional information about the data subjects either. Studies of especially sensitive or contentious topics may similarly consider including a non-disease / event cohort to prevent data providers from learning a sensitive status about the data subjects. However, for studies that would not analyse data on such a cohort, this brings additional data flow, which should be minimised by immediate third party deletion of any data received in the data extracts for this surplus cohort.",

For example, multiple providers may not share matching fields for linkage, in which case one or more providers may act as a 'bridge' by providing multiple digests, each to be matched with those from a different provider. Other schemes could be considered for reaching agreement on the salt used by data providers in pseudonymisation [56] . Controls may need to be applied to the environment in which the dataset is held, for example where data access agreements do not mitigate against linkage with auxiliary information, through which 'jigsaw re-identification' may occur [57] . This may be at a loss of flexibility in the environment or researcher autonomy. The transferability of our data flow approach may be limited where there are additional legal requirements, industrial standards and organisational agreements applicable to different data types (e.g. human tissue), institutes and countries. Amendments may be necessary in transferring the described approach to other contexts or jurisdictions, which may require additional ethical and legal scrutiny and stakeholder involvement. However, the protocol template and steps described should aid in considering the relevant issues and developing a tailored protocol. The protocol can even be adapted if other contexts necessitate using other approaches to pseudonymisation or anonymisation [58, 59] . For example, if a project had approval to use pseusonymised data in order to relay study results to the participants, the protocol could be adapted by retaining the third party salt. Using the template, with adaptations, will efficiently aid in appropriately considering the wider information security and governance framework, including secure data transfer and access restrictions.",

However, the final list of variables was constrained and was reviewed including by the HRA, CAG, Queen's Counsel and University of Leeds legal team and IT Assurance. Projects using different datasets will require consideration of re-identification risk following data linkage. However, we list the data processing applied in the case study to common data types (Table 1) , which should aid in determining any appropriate steps. Tools such as sdcMicro could aid the third party in checking for any disclosure risk brought through the linking of variables [60]. Such work may bring resource cost and delay research access. Researchers should be informed of all data processing steps in order to be able to consider any impact on the statistical properties of the dataset that may bias analyses [51] .",

The third party could have alternatively replaced each digest with a random ID, but given the difficulties in true randomisation this random ID would still then require pseudonymising with a salt that is destroyed, so such an approach would have introduced extra steps into the process. While in this study the digests were deemed anonymous in context of the third party (e.g. by the Queen's Counsel) prior to re-pseudonymisation and salt destruction, it is hoped that in time there will be further clarification, in national and international contexts, of the legal stance on such data.

It incorporates best practice and provides adaptable steps for handling data in accordance with the current ethical and legal framework in the UK and European Union, but has potential global application. This flexible and adaptable protocol may facilitate the move toward widespread utilisation of the growing volumes of data available. We also proposed a cross-accreditation approach and recommended criteria that may support organisations in adopting appropriate data handling practices and offering public reassurance.",
