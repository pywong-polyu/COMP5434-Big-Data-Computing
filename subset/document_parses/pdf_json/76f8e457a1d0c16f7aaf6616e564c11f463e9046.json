During the first wave, 1746 patients were diagnosed with NSCLC compared to an average of 2641 patients in 2018 and 2019. The most severe decline in lung cancer diagnoses was 50%, with only 146 weekly diagnoses with NSCLC vs. 296 weekly diagnoses with NSCLC in the control period. Between the first and second wave, the number of patients diagnosed recovered to the expected numbers observed in 2018 and 2019. However, during the second wave (21-09-2020 until 27-12-2020), we observed another 25% decline of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients. With such a major decrease, we expect a significant increase in the proportion of newly diagnosed lung cancer patients with a high stage of disease in the first months of 2021 compared to the control period.",

No significant differences were found in gender and age. We observed comparable results for the 2nd wave regarding ECOG PS and increase of metastatic disease. The latter seems to result from a small shift of stage III to stage IV disease. A probable cause of this stage shift might be patient delay during both COVID waves if symptoms were neglected or hospital visits avoided for fear of contamination.",
