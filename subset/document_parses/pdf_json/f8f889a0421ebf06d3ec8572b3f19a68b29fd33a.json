We describe how the outbreak of COVID-19 disease, and associated stay-at-home orders in four political regions, have affected the quantity and quality of data collected by participants in one volunteer-based bird monitoring project, eBird. The four regions were selected both for their early and prolonged periods of mandated changes to human activity, and because of the high densities of observations collected. We compared the months of April 2020 with April in previous years. The most notable change was in the landscapes in which observations were made: in all but one region human-dominated landscapes were proportionally more common in the data in April 2020, and observations made near the rarer wetland habitat were less prevalent. We also found subtler changes in quantity of data collected, as well as in observer effort within observation periods. Finally, we found that these effects of COVID-19 disease varied across the political units, and thus we conclude that any analyses of eBird data will require region-specific examination of whether there have been any changes to the data collection process during the COVID-19 pandemic that would need to be taken into account.",

The sampling processes of citizen science projects with relatively unstructured data-collection protocolswith observers choosing when, where and for how long to make observationshave the potential to systematically change through time, both within and among years, with changes in observers' motivation and life circumstances. It is important to identify the sources of temporal variation in the sampling process that must be controlled during data analysis, particularly when describing changes through time in distribution and abundance. The emergence of COVID-19 disease starting in late 2019 has disrupted human activity around the world, including disruptions to highly structured monitoring of bird populations. For example, in 2020 data collection for the North American Breeding Bird Survey was cancelled (BBS National Offices, 2020) , and the British Breeding Bird Survey activity was highly curtained (The BTO Team, 2020) . Although less structured citizen science projects have not ceased activity, the volume and type of observations submitted may have been significantly altered due to restrictions imposed on human movement. If we want to use data from relatively unstructured projects in order to understand the effects of this pandemic on natural systems (Rutz et al., 2020) , or to use such data in lieu of those from more structured monitoring programs in 2020, it will be necessary to understand whether and how observer behaviour has changed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

However, anecdotally there are also suggestions that these same restrictions may have increased the desire of people to connect with the natural world (e.g., Flaccus, 2020) , and in some regions bird watchers have been actively encouraged to report birds that they see from their homes (anonymous, 2020; Bird Count India, 2020; Domingues, 2020) .

One aspect of quality of the entire dataset is the evenness with which observations are distributed across a region; evenly spaced observations contain greater independent information than the same number of observations that are clustered together. I.e. spatial autocorrelation are routinely higher, and thus each datum provides a lower amount of independent ecological information, for locations that are in closer proximity (e.g., Koenig, 1999) . Because of restrictions of human movement, we expect that observations will be more clustered, and that urbanized landscapes will be represented more frequently in the data collected during the pandemic, exacerbating an existing bias toward the collection of observations near to urban centers (e.g., Tulloch and Szabo, 2012; unpubl. data from eBird) , and the reporting of species that more commonly are found near people. We also expect that rare habitat types such as wetland areas, and their associated faunas, will be under-sampled because the curtailment of long-distance movement has made it less likely that observers will travel to these habitats.",

Detection rates will also vary with multiple aspects of observer behaviour such as the durations of observation periods and distances travelled during observation periods . Both of these may have changed during the pandemic. We do not have a clear expectation for whether pandemic-related restrictions to observers' movements will have decreased durations of observation periods (i.e. less motivation because of low avian diversity in urban areas), or increase the durations of observation periods because of additional time being available. We expect that a greater proportion of counts will be made by people who are stationary (e.g., counting birds from within their homes), and that those observers who are moving during observation periods will travel shorter distances. Impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on the factors that affect probabilities of detection need to be identified and taken into account so that differences in probabilities of detection are not erroneously interpreted as changes in abundances.",

We have looked for evidence of effects in four political regions that we will use as examples of the potential impacts of the pandemic on the data being collected by the eBird project. These regions are the U.S. states of California and New York, and the countries of Portugal and Spain. Spain underwent a longer and stricter curtailment of human activity in the spring of 2020 than in the other regions, and our expectation is that Spain may have some of the largest differences in data being collected during the pandemic. For each of these political units we assess whether the quantities of data were affected by comparing data submissions from April 2020 -when all four political units were under stay-at-home decreesto the data collected in April of previous years. We also assessed changes in various facets of data quality. We looked for greater representation of urban landscapes within the data from April 2020 across the four political units; additionally, we looked for evidence of a decline in representation of wetland habitat. Also, we carried out analyses to look for evidence of other potential changes in the behaviour of observers that might have led to deviation in the detection rates of birds in April 2020 compared to the same month in previous years.",

For this, we selected the states of California and New York, and the countries of Spain and Portugal (excluding their overseas territories: the Spanish autonomous communities of the Canary Islands, Cueta and Melilla; the Portuguese autonomous regions of the Azores and Madeira Islands). We chose California and New York both because of the large quantities of data available in these two states, and also because the restrictions imposed on citizens of these states were among the strongest and earliest in the United States. In both of these states, stay-at-home orders came into effect in late March 2020, and continued throughout and beyond the month of April. The governments of Spain and Portugal, countries with partner organizations coordinating nation-specific versions of eBird (eBird Espa\u00f1a, and PortugalAves) and high participation by resident bird watchers, also decreed stay-at-home restrictions that were in place throughout April 2020, and in Spain these restrictions placed very severe limits on peoples' ability to leave their places of residence. We are restricting our analyses to data from the month of April, and comparing the data from April 2020 to those collected in April of preceding, typically 3-4, years. Note that 2020 was the first year of data collection for the third New York Breeding Bird Atlas, for which eBird is serving as the data-collection and management platform, which independently may have affected the quantity and quality of data within eBird. It is not possible to separate atlas-specific observations from those made for other purposes; however, April is prior to nesting of most bird species in New York state, and thus prior to the greatest focus of data collection for the breeding bird atlas.",

Because data entry for eBird is entirely done through a web data-entry page or increasingly from smartphones, there was no need to wait multiple months for the data compliation to contain records of essentially all observations made in April 2020. We found that only a small proportion (<1%) of observation records from the month of April 2020 first appeared in the compilations of these data that were created in mid-June or mid-July 2020. We used the R package auk (Strimas-Mackey et al., 2018) to extract only the records from the month of April for the four regions described above. We filtered these records to only include data from those observation events that are routinely used in analyses at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology, which is the lead organization maintaining the eBird enterprise; these practices and the reason for their use are summarized in Johnston et al. (2020) . We retained data only from \"complete checklists\" (i.e. observation events for which the nondetections could be inferred for all species not reported). For most of our analyses, except when counting the number of observers, we used auk to reduce \"shared checklists\", which are multiple versions of the same observation event, to one record for each shared group. We only retained records for which observation effort was within these criteria: durations of observation periods were between 3 and 300 min, and travel distances were no more than 5 km (for rationale see Johnston et al., 2020) .",

We measured quantities as the number of separate observation events within each hexagonal grid cell, summed across all days in the month of April separately for each year. For the U.S. states we calculated these summaries between 2005 and 2020 inclusive (eBird began in 2002 in the U.S.). eBird was formally adapted substantially later in Portugal and Spain, and we created these summaries only for the years from 2015 and 2017 onward, for Portugal and Spain respectively. The quantity of data being collected by eBird is increasing through time (Sullivan et al., 2014) , and thus the potential impact of COVID-19 disease for which we looked was a deviation in the number of observation events in 2020 relative to the number expected based on the trend from prior years. We modelled the distributions of these responses using generalized inverse Gaussian (GIG) distributions, in which the response could take any value from zero to positive infinity with the shape of the distribution controlled by specifying mean, variance, and skewness. Preliminary analyses showed the GIG distribution to be the best available choice with which to model the data, based on inspection of Q-Q plots created by R's gamlss package. We found that GIG regression models only slightly under-predicted the very largest observed values. We created a set of 20 candidate models (the combinations of fixed effects are listed in Table A1 ) in which we allowed each of mean, variance, and skewness to vary as a function of some combination of calendar year (continuous variable, hereafter \"CalYr\"), and whether the data were from the COVID-19 year (i.e. 2020 versus all other calendar years; \"COVIDYr\"). In this model set, CalYr was always included as a predictor of variation in the mean number of checklists because of our expectation that numbers of observation events have increased through time. The predictor variable COVIDYr was present as a main effect in some models of variation in the mean, and presence or absence of COVIDYr in otherwise identical models allowed us to determine whether there was a statistically important deviation in 2020 from the numbers of observation events expected based on the trend in prior years that was described by CalYr. We modelled changes in variance and skewness similarly, except that we also included models in which variance and skewness remained constant through time (i.e. intercept-only models of variance or skewness). We identified wellsupported models based on their AIC scores, considering the wellsupported models to be those within \u0394AIC \u22648 of the best-supported model (Burnham and Anderson, 2002) .",

Based on prior work with eBird data (D. Fink, pers. comm.) , at least in North America we expected that in recent years the typical values of the responses of interesthabitats surveyed, and observer effortshould be approximately constant through time, unless the COVID-19 pandemic had an impact on observers' behaviour in 2020. Thus, our tests for effects of COVID-19 did not model a systematic trend across years, but instead we treated CalYr as a categorical variable and compared observer behaviour in April 2020 to behaviour in the month of April of the preceding 4 years: 2016-2019, inclusive (or the 3 years 2017-2019 for Spain). We again created sets of candidate models with which to examine effects of COVID-19 on interannual variation in each moment of distribution (e.g., mean, variance, skewness) of the reponse. The year 2020 was set to be the reference category; in other words, the regression coefficient for CalYr = 2020 describes a baseline value of the response (i.e. it is the intercept), and the regression coefficients for each of the other years describe the deviation from the 2020 value. By parameterizing the model in this way, we are conveniently able to evaluate whether there was a consistent difference between 2020 and all earlier years, because differences would be indicated by the regression coefficients for the other years being either all above zero, or all below zero. In this paper, we will describe 2020 as being statistically different if other years' coefficients were all positive (or all negative) and if the 95% confidence limits around all of these coefficients did not overlap zero.",

This is a beta distribution (response values of between 0 and 1) modified to allow excess or deficit in the presence of response values of 0 or 1. The use of this distribution enabled modelling of the effects of predictor variables on mean, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. We used only one fixed effect predictor variable, CalYr (categorical predictor). For each political unit, we fitted a set of models in which each moment of the distribution could be either constant or a function of CalYr.

As a consequence, we chose to treat the presence of wetland habitat as a binary response: either there was, or there was not any nearby wetland habitat. We fitted these binary-response data using a single model for the data from each political unit. This model contained CalYr as a categorical fixed effect (2020 was the reference/intercept year). The grid cell in which an observation was made was treated as a random intercept, which controlled for variation in the prevalence of wetlands across each political unit.

We have separated our analyses into these two components because our prior experience with these data has shown that a \"stationary count\" is not simply a travelling count of zero distance. Our analyses for component (1) were logistic regression models in which a single model was fitted to the data from each political unit. This model has a single fixed effect predictor, CalYr (categorical variable; 2020 is the reference/intercept year) and the grid cell of each observation as a random intercept. For our analyses of component (2) we fitted the same set of models that we used to examine variation in the duration of observation periods (Table A3 ). The distribution of the response variable was truncated, and we fitted data using a truncated generalized inverse Gaussian distribution, this time allowing values to range between 0.01 km and 5 km, the range produced by our filtering of the total set of data and removing all data from stationary counts.",

Based on inspection of the data, our experimentation with adjusting model fitting, and conversations with colleagues, we suggest that the lack of model convergence was the result of intrinsic difficulties in fitting GAMLSS models.

From our analyses of data from New York state, there were 14 models within \u0394AIC \u22648 of the best-supported model. For the model sets from each of the four of the political units, all regression parameters describing deviations of 2020 from prior years were estimated with 95% confidence limits that overlapped with zero. In other words, there is no statistical support for the existence of differences in the number of observations per grid cell between April 2020 and April of prior years.",

However, these effects varied among the four political units whose data we examined. We found a reduction in the proportion of travelling observation events, and in the two U.S. states we also found subtle changes in the distances travelled for those observation events that were \"travelling counts\" (Fig. 4) . We also found shifts toward making observations in more human-dominated landscapes and away from landscapes containing wetlands, with the exception of New York state for which urban-dominated landscapes were statistically less likely to be sampled in 2020 ( Fig. 3 ; Table 1 ). Of note, we found that not all of these changes were shifts in averages. We fitted models that simultaneously described changes in mean, variance, skewness, and (for the proportion of urban habitat) kurtosis, and each of these moments of distribution was significantly different in 2020 in one or more analyses. We have not attempted to provide separate interpretations for variance, skewness and kurtosis, but instead for the purpose of our paper we emphasize that changes in any and all of these moments of distribution are associated with changes in the shapes of distributions of observer activity. These changes in distribution of data are best interpreted by examination of graphs that visualize the changes in shapes of distributions, as this encompasses changes in all of the parameters. Our most important conclusion is that any use of eBird data to infer changes in the abundance or distribution of birds in 2020 must account for changes in the checklists that were contributed during periods of altered daily patterns of human activity. This applies to studies designed to infer impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic or those that include data from this year for other purposes. Important aspects of change to data contributions to consider are: the spatial distribution of observers' activity, the specific habitats visited by observers, and the amount and type of effort expended during the collection of these data. If assessments do not account for changes to observer behaviour and data submissions, misleading conclusions will often be made regarding changes to bird populations and communities in 2020.",

Instead, any use of the data from 2020 will require analysts to determine how the COVID-19 pandemic has affected their data and apply the necessary corrections (e.g., Johnston et al., 2020) . Further, those analysing data from broad geographic areas will need to consider that the impacts of the pandemic will have varied across their study region. This point is illustrated by the differences found between California and New York in the United States, and especially between the neighbouring countries of Spain and Portugal. The differences that we found in the data from Portugal and Spain are consistent with differences in the severity with which stay-at-home restrictions were imposed in these two countries: in Spain the prohibition on leaving one's place of residence was almost absolute, whereas in Portugal people were able to walk outside within a few kilometers of their homes. Additionally, the restrictions imposed in Portugal were relaxed in the last week of April. We suggest that the differences between New York state and the other three political units (e.g., Fig. 3 ) illustrate that responses to the COVID-19 pandemic may not have been the only cause of variation in observer behaviour in 2020. The shifting of observer activity away from urban landscapes in New York is consistent both with observers in New York state generally avoiding urban areas, as well as with observers shifting their efforts toward searching areas with a greater diversity of nesting species for the third New York Breeding Bird Atlas. Our findings have a more general implication for the analyses of broad-scale ecological data in that analytical approaches proposed for dealing with spatial variation assume gradual variation through space (e.g., Fink et al., 2010; Osborne et al., 2007; Royle and Young, 2008) , but the potential for sharp differences in observer behaviour across political boundaries cannot be ignored.",

For any specific region these changes in detection frequency will vary with the magnitude of change in observer effort, and will also differ among species. This underlines the importance of including effort variables in models, to describe the heterogeneity in detectability between observations (Kelling et al., 2019) . Including observer effort as a predictor variable can be complicated because, for example, 1 h of observation effort or 1 km of distance travelled likely will produce different counts of birds or different lists of species for observers who are in different habitats. Describing such interactions can be a complex task when parametric statistical models are being specified, although machine-learning models such as random forest or boosted regression trees models should automatically detect important interactions among factors that affect detection rates (e.g., Elith et al., 2008) .

In conclusion, we found that bird watchers participating in data collection for eBird did alter their behaviours in April 2020 in response to the restrictions on human movement that resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the magnitude of the change to daily life, it is perhaps notable that the changes observed in eBird data are not more substantial. Nevertheless, the behaviour of observers did change in ways that will require analyses of eBird's data to account for differences in the proportional representation of habitats in observations, and differences in observer effort. While we have only looked for changes in observer activity in four political units, we have found different effects on the activities of project participants among these political units. We expect such differences have occurred globally, given the substantial differences in political and policy responses to the pandemic around the globe and the different environments in which observers live. These regional differences in effects on participants' behaviour will need to be taken into account for most any use of these data. This applies to examining whether behaviour and local distribution of wild animals was altered by pandemic-related changes in human behaviour. This conclusion also applies more broadly to the use of data from eBird collected during the pandemic for other purposes including montoring of longer term changes in distribution and abundance. We have only looked at changes in the behaviour of participants in one project, eBird. However, we expect that similar changes in observer behaviour in 2020 have occurred for other projects for which volunteer participants choose how much effort to expend, where to expend their effort, and when to expend their effort. Thus, similar analytical challenges await anyone using data collected by these other projects during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In Portugal this project (PortugalAves) has been possible thanks to the remarkable work of a voluntary reviewers team: Alexandre Leit\u00e3o, Am\u00e9rico Guedes, Ana Mendon\u00e7a, Andr\u00e9 Vieira, Ant\u00f3nio Gon\u00e7alves, Carlos Pacheco, Carlos Pereira, C\u00e1tia Gouveia, Filipe Can\u00e1rio, Fl\u00e1vio Oliveira, Guillaume Rethor\u00e9, H\u00e9lder Vieira, Hugo Lousa, Jo\u00e3o Tiago Tavares, Jorge Ara\u00fajo, Jorge Safara, M\u00e1rio Estevens, Matthias Tissot, Paulo Alves, Paulo Belo, Pedro Cardia, Pedro Fernandes, Pedro Moreira, Pedro Nicolau, Pedro Ramalho, Ricardo Brand\u00e3o, Ricardo Melo, Rui Machado, R\u00faben Coelho, Thijs valkenburg, Vasco Flores Cruz and Xurxo Pi\u00f1eiro Alvarez. Our ability to document the effects of strict public health measures in Spain has been possible thanks to a very active and growing eBird reviewer community, and to the efforts of past and present coordinators of eBird in Spain: Juan Ignacio De\u00e1n, Gorka Gorospe, Yeray Seminario, Marc G\u00e1lvez, Javier Morala and Miguel \u00c1 ngel Madrid as well as the support of the pioneer naturalist societies of Gorosti and Itsas Enara. eBird data analysis \"quant group\" discussions improved the research described in this manuscript during its development. Funding for this work came from the Wolf Creek Foundation, The Leon Levy Foundation, The Packard Foundation, and the National Science Foundation [grants ITR-0427914, DBI-0542868, IIS-0612031, ABI-1356308, CCF-1522054, ICR-1927646].
