The aim of the present study was to explore the trends in the psychological status of individuals entering from high-risk areas of COVID-19 coronavirus while quarantining in dedicated hotels. Methods: A total of 591 individuals who isolated in dedicated hotels were recruited between March and June 2020. Participants self-reported mental symptoms [Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS)] every three days during the quarantine. A mixed-effects linear regression model was used to assess the trends. Results: Participants reporting anxiety and depression symptoms at least one time during quarantine accounted for 4.5% and 18.4%, respectively. Their psychological status was alleviated during some first 9 days, and then it slightly deteriorated, which was suggested by SAS and SDS scores that were negatively correlated with the days of quarantine (T) (adjusted coefficient [\u03b2] \u22120.81, 95% CI \u22121.00 to \u22120.62; and \u03b2 \u22120.75, 95% CI \u22120.97 to \u22120.53, respectively), and were positively correlated with the square of T (\u03b2 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06; and \u03b2 0.04, 95% CI 0.02 to 0.06, respectively). The unemployed and 18~30-year-old participants were prone to greater levels of psychological distress. No significant difference in the trend of mental health was found among different subgroups. Conclusion: The mental health of the people entering Guangzhou from high-risk areas of COVID-19 coronavirus resulted positive during the early period of quarantine in dedicated hotels, after which it deteriorated. The psychological status of individuals should be closely monitored at the beginning and after more than 9 days of quarantine, especially for individuals who are unemployed and 18~30-year-old ones.",

            "text": "In December 2019, there was an outbreak of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) in China that rapidly swept across the world. By April 2021, there were more than 136 million confirmed cases globally. 1 Due to the long incubation period of COVID-19 and the fact that covert cases could represent some 60% of all infections, 2 quarantining assists in separating and restricting the movement of people who were potentially exposed to the disease and is thought to effectively control the spread of the disease. 3 People entering from high-risk areas of COVID-19 coronavirus are usually required to be self-isolated at home or quarantined in dedicated facilities for 14 days. However, the infection can be easily transmitted to other family members due to inadequate prevention and control measures of home quarantine; 4,5 thus, quarantine in dedicated facilities was advocated in many countries or regions when the infectious disease broke out. 3 Following the overwhelming global spread of the COVID-19 epidemic in the second half of 2020, many countries or regions besides mainland China, such as Hong Kong, 6 Australia, 7 Singapore, 8 and even the England, 9 have started to use dedicated quarantine hotels for isolation of people entering from high-risk areas or countries. Following these policies, a large number of people were quarantined in dedicated facilities due to cross-border travel. Eg, in Hong Kong, 10 about 100 thousand person-times left for mainland China in December 2020 alone, and about 10 thousand people entered from high-risk areas other than mainland China.",

COVID-19 has been reported to cause a series of psychological health threats in the general public. [11] [12] [13] In particular, people who had quarantining experiences during the epidemic outbreak had more psychological distress than those who did not. 14, 15 In addition, most of the previous studies on the impact of quarantining on individual's mental health were cross-sectionally designed and were comparing the mental health status of people with and without isolation experience, [14] [15] [16] [17] while few studies have reported on dynamic psychological changes in quarantined individuals in dedicated hotels throughout the period of a couple of weeks. Such an approach may help us identify more effective mental health improvement strategies. Even though the governments have generally realized that psychological counseling is needed for quarantined individuals, it remains unclear when might be the best time point for psychological counseling and which subgroups are the most vulnerable to psychological stress. As the environment people face (people quarantining at home vs people quarantining in the hotel) is quite different, 3 it is necessary to separately explore the mental health of people quarantining in dedicated hotels. Therefore, exploring the dynamic psychological changes and their influencing factors is of great importance. It might help us formulate more effective and targeted psychological intervention measures, especially if we consider that the number of individuals who are quarantined in dedicated hotels will continue to grow due to the frequent cross-border travel.",

Longitudinal SAS and SDS scores were used as dependent variables in multilevel mixed-effects linear regression models with maximum likelihood estimation and were implemented in SPSS23.0. Compared with the traditional repeated measurement analysis of variance, the mixed effect model does not require the same time interval for each response of the sample and is less affected by the missing data at some time points. 29 In this study, data missing at some time points of the scales were not filled in. Mean scores were used for the outcome measure rather than fitting a model for a binary outcome indicator. This is because such a model approach could further reduce the sample available for analysis as it excludes those with concordant responses over follow-up when exploring the fixed effect of independent variables, affecting the statistical power and generalizability of the findings. This analysis nests correlates the data, thereby accounting for violations in the assumption of independence. For the present data, repeated assessments over time were nested in individuals (the random effect). Fixed effects (ie, predictors in the regression) included linear, quadratic effects of days of quarantine (T and T 2 ) and confounders. Interactions between the days of quarantine and predefined subgroups were fitted to investigate heterogeneity in the effect of days of quarantine on mental health. Effect estimates were also reported by subgroup, and the associated p values were used to test the null hypothesis, ie, that there is no evidence for a difference in the effect of days of A sensitivity analysis was done to assess the potential impact of some participants who did not fill the questionnaire at recommended time points. For this analysis, the mixed-effects analysis was re-run after the data were revised as follows: the questionnaire filled out on days 2 and 4 of quarantine (T=2 and 4) was adjusted to the day 3 (T=3), on days 5 and 7 (T=5 and 7) was adjusted to day 6 (T=6), on 8 and 10 days (T=8 and 10) was adjusted to day 9 (T=9), and on 11 and above days (T\u226511) was adjusted to day 12 (T=12).",

            "text": "The incidence of depression and anxiety symptoms observed in the present study was lower compared to previous surveys that were conducted in the participants with quarantine during the infection pandemic such as SARS (7.6-31.2%). 15, 17, [25] [26] [27] We speculated that this might be because mortality rates of COVID-19 were relatively low compared with that of SARS (11%). 28 In fact, a similar low incidence of psychological distress was also found in individuals quarantined due to the outbreak of H1N1 (mortality: 1%). 27 The results of multi-level mixed-effects models showed that the symptoms of anxiety and depression had a downward trend during the early period of quarantine, which might be due to the greatest psychological stress caused by the nervousness of people first coming to unfamiliar dedicated hotels. 3 With the progression of quarantine, anxiety and depression were lessened in these participants. The possible reasons include: (1) if they were infected, they usually had symptoms a few days after the beginning of the quarantine; 30 thus, with the progression of the quarantine, the risk of being infected decreases in these asymptomatic people; (2) they gradually adapt to the isolated living environment; (3) they have better access to medical services during quarantine because of the deployment of sufficient professional health personnel at the dedicated hotels, meaning that if they have any symptoms, they could be timely diagnosed and treated. Previous studies have also confirmed that sufficient material and medical services supply can effectively alleviate the psychological distress of quarantined people. 3 These factors may also be the reason why some studies found no difference in psychological status between quarantined people and non-quarantined people. 16, 17 Our results suggested that when people first came to the dedicated hotels, they were the most in need of psychological counseling. Also, telemedicine and remote counseling may be a feasible way to provide psychological counseling, as it can reduce the risk of exposure to COVID-19. 31 Moreover, we also found that the psychological symptoms of the participants deteriorated after 8 or 9 days of the quarantine. Previous cross-sectional studies reported similar findings, ie, the psychological symptoms of those in quarantine for >10 days were worse compared to those in quarantine for <10 days. 25, 26 Thus, the quarantine time should be controlled within 9 days if possible to reduce psychological distress caused by quarantine. As the incubation period of 2019-nCoV is less likely to exceed more than 9 days, converting the quarantine from dedicated facilities into home quarantine after 9 days of quarantine should be considered.",

Therefore, compared with others, they have a weaker ability to resist risks and more worries about the future, which might lead to greater psychological distress. 3, 13 Meanwhile, more depressive symptoms were observed in the later quarantine period, which might be because in March 2020, China stopped working, and people did not go to work regardless of being quarantined or not. 12 However, the Chinese had gradually resumed their work since May 2020, but people who were quarantined in the later period could still not go to work and faced greater economic pressure, which might, in turn, lead to depression.

Second, isolation measures during the outbreak limited the ability to follow up with these participants, and some participants filled out the questionnaire less frequently than they should. The underreporting of some people's mental health information may cause bias to the research results and reduce the reliability of the conclusion, although appropriate models were used to fully dig the information of existing data.
