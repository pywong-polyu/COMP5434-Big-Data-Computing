Elderly people are more likely to develop a severe and critical form of the disease. Diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, acute respiratory distress syndrome, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes can predict poorer outcomes [5] , putting elderly people at risk of faster clinical deterioration [6] . In Romania, The National Institute of Public Health provides a weekly report concerning the COVID-19 situation. Their statistics highlight that the median age of death due to COVID-19 is 71 years and that all people who have died from this disease have had at least one comorbidity. It has also been shown that 59.8% of deaths occurred in males [7] . In a case study, the European Commission's H2020 Expert Group pointed that sex and gender can impact the outcome of contracting COVID-19 and that more men than woman die from acute infection [8] . Regarding the COVID-19 mortality rate in other European countries, data published at the beginning of February 2021 by the WHO Coronavirus Disease Dashboard showed the following: 3.51% in Hungary, 3.46% in Italy, 2.73% in Germany, 2.54% in Romania, 2.41% in France, and 2.09% in Spain (number of deaths/total number of reported cases) [9] .",

They were later adapted and improved for European countries (due to several differences regarding approved medicines in the European market and treatment strategies), giving rise to the Screening Tool of Older Persons' Prescriptions (STOPP) and the Screening Tool to Alert to Right Treatment (START) criteria, which were published in 2008. The American Geriatrics Society updates the Beers criteria every three years (starting from 2012), while the STOPP/START version 1 criteria were updated seven years after first being published, in 2015 [15] . The STOPP/START criteria are now recognized by several institutes and geriatric societies and are used by many European countries in routine clinical practice [16, 17] .",

Moreover, in 2016, Wauters et al. concluded that mortality and hospitalization rates are related to inappropriate medication prescription practices, such as overuse (prescribing more medicines than are clinically needed and with potential harmful effects that exceed the potential benefits) and misuse (incorrectly prescribing a medicine) of medicines [13, [18] [19] [20] .",

The use of PPIs or misoprostol reduces, but does not eliminate, this risk. Moreover, the use of NSAIDs can increase blood pressure and induce kidney injury, which can aggravate heart failure, as they promote fluid retention and can increase mortality [26] . Therefore, it is recommended to use NSAIDs with caution in the lowest effective dose and for the shortest possible period of treatment (acute treatment), as they can induce several gastrointestinal, renal, and/or cardiovascular side effects, as described in Table 7 [40].

Thus, physicians must consider this risk, as well as the associations of medicines that can aggravate hyponatremia, as even mild forms of hyponatremia are associated with negative clinical outcomes, such as cognitive impairment, falls, hospitalizations, and mortality [46] . Moreover, a higher mortality rate has been observed in patients with moderate or severe hyponatremia [47, 48] . In addition, the STOPP/START v.2 criteria state that the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants (the most commonly prescribed medicines nowadays) must be avoided in patients with hyponatremia, as they can exacerbate this condition, while the 2019 Beers criteria also include tramadol in the list of medicines that can aggravate hyponatremia or cause inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) [26, 27, 48] . Thus, it is extremely important to decrease the number of chronic prescriptions of NSAIDs in the Romanian elderly population and to monitor sodium levels in patients undergoing chronic treatment with NSAIDs, as deleterious effects can arise, with extremely dangerous consequences.",

Moreover, smokers require higher doses of the medication, and smoking cessation increases its toxicity. It is susceptible to drug-drug interactions with the following medicines: phenytoin, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, levothyroxine, and benzodiazepines [58] . In addition, as cardiovascular diseases are the primary pathologies encountered in the elderly Romanian population (based on our study findings using the percentages of chronic conditions and other European reports) [59] , treatment with theophylline can increase the risk of cardiovascular complications with serious side effects, especially in patients with atrial fibrillation and congestive heart failure. Thus, due to the low risk/benefit ratio and despite its low price, it is recommended that theophylline is replaced with other bronchodilator medicines (\u03b2 2 -agonists or anticholinergics) with safer and more efficient profiles. Further, the 2019 Beers criteria mention an increased risk of theophylline toxicity when the drug is associated with other medicines, especially enzyme inhibitors (e.g., ciprofloxacin), administered for acute treatments [26] .

Moreover, sleep-disordered breathing should be diagnosed in a timely manner and treated effectively in elderly patients, as it can be a prime cause of sleep disorders [61, 62] . An alternative medicine for the treatment of sleep disorders could be melatonin (as its natural secretion decreases with age), which is better tolerated and has fewer side effects.

In the last five years, according to statistics provided by Eurostat and the OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development), Romania has allocated about 5% of its gross domestic product to health spending [70, 71] . When compared to Switzerland, which invests about 12.5% of its GDP in health, or the European average, which is close to 7% of the GDP, it is clear that there is a major difference between Romania and other civilized countries in this regard. Additionally, of interest for our research is that, according to Eurostat statistics, regarding the destination of invested health budgets, in Romania, approximately 54.4% is spent on treating and rehabilitating patients, 27% is spent on equipment and goods needed in the medical process, and only 18% is spent on other expenses, including prevention. We compared this with Switzerland, which ranks first in the allocation of financial resources for other activities, including prevention and found that only half the budget of other countries is allocated for preventive medicine in Romania [70, 71] .

Association of antiplatelet agents with direct thrombin inhibitor, vitamin K antagonist or factor Xa inhibitors in patients with cerebrovascular or peripheral arterial disease, stable coronary (the dual therapy did not bring any new benefits). 11. Association of NSAID with direct thrombin inhibitor, vitamin K antagonist or factor Xa inhibitors (risk of major gastrointestinal bleeding). 12. Association of NSAID with concurrent antiplatelet agent(s) without using the PPI as prophylaxis (increased risk of peptic ulcer disease). 13. The use of tricyclic antidepressants in patients with dementia, prostatism, cardiac conduction abnormalities, narrow angle glaucoma, or prior history of urinary retention (risk of worsening these conditions).",
