Previously, our group has shown the accuracy of focus prediction to depend on CT readers' confidence in the diagnosis of sepsis using structured analysis of CT reports ( * blinded for submission). Another group has reported an association between stroke and sepsis (8) . Although the significance of cerebrovascular events for managing patients with sepsis seems evident, a systemic and detailed analysis of their detection on cCT performed along with full-body CT was not available before. Another diagnostic caveat would also be the clinical distinction between SAE and stroke (4, 21) . As pointed out by Sonneville et al., the prevalence of prior stroke is more common in patients with SAE (7.4%) as opposed to septic patients with no SAE (3.9%) suggesting a possible association of both stroke and SAE. Still, a lack of data providing the occurrence of new cerebrovascular events in the course of sepsis can be appreciated (4) . Contrary to previous reports, our study failed to show a prognostic relevance of cerebrovascular events probably due to the small sample size. As coagulopathy has been described as both prognostically relevant and an important target for medical intervention in patients with sepsis, its association with cerebrovascular events in sepsis deserves further investigation (6, 22, 23) . Further data on imaging correlates of sepsis-induced neurologic dysfunction on CT and MRI and their diagnostic accuracy are required.",

The above-mentioned associations of imaging features and patient outcomes demand critical discussion and prospective analysis before being interpreted as causalities. Furthermore, cCT is known to be an insufficient imaging technique for detecting SAE -a common sequela of severe infection and intensive care. Importantly, patients in our study population did not necessarily have prior brain imaging, to define their individual baseline white matter status. As this study focused on the occurrence of cerebrovascular events in septic patients, a more accurate analysis of parenchymal alterations including MRI findings during sepsis is beyond the scope of this manuscript. In our opinion, the number of cerebrovascular events in this patient population may be too small to confirm the above mentioned prognostic role in sepsis. This study was planned and conducted to define the incidence of such events, and we additionally studied the occurrence of generalized parenchymal damage to account for another major cerebral finding typically seen in septic patients after resuscitation. One drawback of our retrospective analysis is the lack of documentation of narcotic agents to cross-reference with GCS. Still, the need for sedation reflects the neurological impairment in a broader sense. A further analysis of the infectious source identified on body CT was not subject of the present study, as this will be analyzed in a separate study. The role of acute intracranial hemorrhage in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection (COVID-19) has recently been described by our group (24) .
