In particular, we develop a two-stage procurement planning model in a random environment. We consider a pre-event policy, in which each healthcare institution seeks to minimize the purchasing cost of medical items and the transportation time from the first stage, and a recourse decision process to optimize the expected overall costs and the penalty for the prior plan, in response to each disaster scenario. Thus, each institution deals with a two-stage stochastic programming model that takes into account the unmet demand at the first stage, and the consequent penalty. Then, the institutions simultaneously solve their own stochastic optimization problems and reach a stable state governed by the stochastic Nash equilibrium concept. Moreover, we formulate the problem as a variational inequality; both the discrete and the general probability distribution cases are described. We also present an alternative formulation using infinite-dimensional duality tools. Finally, we discuss some numerical illustrations applying the progressive hedging algorithm.",

Depending on the type of emergency different hazards may occur in the emergency locations. Thus, emergency management has raised increasing interest. In particular, businesses require special measures to protect their activities from any potential dangerous effect of an emergency. Therefore, it is important to establish a plan before the occurrence of these events to be prepared in case an emergency happens. A business continuity plan defines how a company will continue operating, even in the case of a natural disaster, IT failure or a cyber attack.

            "text": "In this paper, we focus on a plan for the storage and distribution of medical supplies among healthcare institutions in emergencies caused by natural disasters. In particular, we model the competition among hospitals as a Nash equilibrium problem and introduce a stochastic programming model to design and evaluate the behavior of each demand location. Inspired by [26, 35] , we provide a two-stage stochastic programming model based on disaster scenarios that introduces the unmet demand at the first stage and the consequent penalty at the second stage, see also [13] . Thus, we consider a preevent policy, in which each healthcare institution minimize both the purchasing cost of medical items and the transportation time from the first stage. Then, we present a post-event policy through a recourse decision process to optimize the expected overall costs, and the penalty for the preassigned plan, in response to each possible disaster scenario of the second stage. Institutions simultaneously solve their own two-stage stochastic optimization problems and reach a stable state governed by the stochastic Nash equilibrium concept, that is formulated as a large-scale variational inequality. In addition, in the case of a general probability distribution, we define the stochastic Nash equilibrium as a random variational inequality in a Hilbert space setting. Then, we give the first order optimality conditions for the second-stage problem in terms of Lagrange multipliers, using a separation assumption, called Assumption S, as a constraint qualification [4] [5] [6] 9] . This condition results to be a necessary and sufficient condition for strong duality to hold. In infinite-dimensional spaces, the classical theorems, which prove strong duality and existence of multipliers, require that the interior of the ordering cone be nonempty [21] . However, in most infinite-dimensional cases, where the functional space is L 2 or a Sobolev space, the ordering cone has the empty interior. Therefore, we aim at proving that the second-stage problem verifies the Assumption S. As a result, we ensure the existence of Lagrange multipliers and give an alternative formulation of the two-stage problem. Moreover, we show that the dual variables regulate the medical item procurement. In fact, they represent the control variables on the first-stage demand, on the second-stage demand, and on the unfulfilled demand.",

As an example, in [26] , the authors presented a stochastic programming model, in which they selected the storage locations of medical supplies and use inventory levels for medical items. In the model, they captured the information updating during disaster scenarios. In [28] , Nagurney et al. developed a stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium model consisting of multiple purchase locations for the disaster relief items, multiple humanitarian organizations, multiple freight service provision options and multiple hubs for storage to multiple points of demand. In [29] , the authors presented a generalized Nash equilibrium model with stochastic demand to analyze competition among organizations at demand points for medical supplies. In [30] , Nagurney and Salarpour introduced a two-stage stochastic game theory model in order to examine the behavior of national governments during Covid-19 pandemic, and their competition for essential medical supplies in both the preparation and response phases. All the problems presented in [28] [29] [30] were solved as variational inequalities, using the concept of variational equilibrium. We remark that our model differs from the treatment in [26] as we develop a variational inequality approach. In addition, although the problems introduced in [28] [29] [30] have similarities, they are all restricted to the case of discrete probability distribution, whereas our model is valid also for general probability distribution. This poses challenges for both theory and computations.",

In Sect. 3, we present the stochastic Nash equilibrium concept underlying our model and the equivalent variational inequality formulation. The cases of discrete and general probability distribution are discussed. In Sect. 4, we recall some infinite-dimensional duality tools, and, in Sect. 5, we present an alternative formulation of the second-stage problem. The progressive hedging algorithm is then applied to some numerical examples in Sect. 6. We summarize our results and draw our conclusions in Sect. 7. of transportation. We note that the suitable transportation mode is often connected to the distance between supply and demand locations. Thus, for long distances airplanes are preferred to transportation by truck or train. The choice of the transportation mode may also depend on the type of medical item or on the severity of the emergency.",

We consider two stages, where one corresponds to the preparedness phase and the other represents the response phase. In the first phase, each demand location, namely the hospital, looks for minimizing the purchasing cost of medical items and the transportation time from the first stage; in the second one, a recourse decision process is developed to optimize the transportation costs from the second stage, in response to each disaster scenario. Let ( , F, P) be a probability space, where the random parameter \u03c9 \u2208 represents the typical disaster scenario. For each \u03c9 \u2208 , we denote by \u03be : \u2192 R W H K +H K a finite-dimensional random vector and by E \u03be the mathematical expectation with respect to \u03be . In order to formulate the twostage stochastic model, we introduce two types of decision variables. The first-stage decision variable x k wh is used to represent the quantity of medical supplies of type k from warehouse w to hospital h in stage one. The second-stage decision variables are y k wh (\u03c9) and z k h (\u03c9). The variable y k wh (\u03c9) represents the quantity of medical supplies of type k to be delivered from warehouse w to hospital h under scenario \u03c9. The variable z k h (\u03c9) is the unfulfilled demand at hospital h of medical supply item k under scenario \u03c9. The amount of unfulfilled demand z k h (\u03c9) is penalized by the penalty function \u03c0 k h = \u03c0 k h (\u03c9, z k h (\u03c9)). We note that x k wh is chosen before a realization of \u03be is revealed and later y k wh (\u03c9) and z k h (\u03c9) are selected with known realization. We set y wh (\u03c9) = k\u2208K y k wh (\u03c9). We further group the y wh (\u03c9) into the W H\u2212dimensional column vector y(\u03c9). Finally, we introduce the transportation cost c m wh from warehouse w to hospital h with mode m and assume that it depends on the total amount y(\u03c9), namely, c m wh = c m wh (\u03c9, y(\u03c9)).

For the calculation of transportation costs, we apply the Product & Distance-based calculation rule, which computes the transportation costs based on the coefficients for transportation costs (that include all the different terms, e.g., fuel price, tolls, etc.) for national shipments assumed to be 0.19e/km * m 3 . For transportation time from warehouses to hospitals, we consider hourly cost set, that includes the time spending for the loading process, the route to go and the unloading process. Penalty costs, concerning the unfulfilled demand, depends on the number of items that are not delivered in one day.",

Each hospital solves a two-stage stochastic optimization problem, where, in the first stage, seeks to minimize the purchasing cost of medical items and the transportation time. Then, we introduced a recourse decision process to optimize the expected overall costs and the penalty for the prior plan, in response to each possible disaster scenario of the second stage. The hospitals simultaneously solve their own stochastic optimization problems and reach a stable state given by the stochastic Nash equilibrium concept. Specific features of the model include: the uncertainty of the scenarios, the supply availability of medical items, the penalty for unmet demand and the fluctuating costs. The model is formulated as a variational inequality. In the case of general probability distribution, we characterized the Nash equilibrium of the problem as a solution to an infinite-dimensional variational inequality in the Hilbert space L 2 . The associated Lagrange function was studied, and a strong duality result was provided. Finally, we presented some numerical illustrations solved applying the progressive hedging algorithm. The results reveal that hospitals are able to re-arrange timely their requests in order to satisfy the need for medical items. In emergencies, uncertainty plays a fundamental role in the success of disaster management; hence, health institutions must be ready to adjust the request of medical items. Our contributions to the literature lie in advancing the state-of-the-art of stochastic programming for disaster management as well as applications of variational inequalities and strong duality. We also emphasize that to date there has been limited work on stochastic programming problems under general probability distribution.",

Following a discrete approximation scheme as in [23] , we choose |R| = 5 realizations of random variable \u03be with probability 1/R. We note that hospital medical items are generally purchased as multiple packs into boxes. In our examples, we consider two different cases. In the first example, we consider some indispensable items; hence, we use a high penalty of unfulfilled demand, and we consider all cost referred to a single pack. In the second example, we consider a box as a unit of measurement, which contains thousand packs and a low penalty of unfulfilled demand.",
