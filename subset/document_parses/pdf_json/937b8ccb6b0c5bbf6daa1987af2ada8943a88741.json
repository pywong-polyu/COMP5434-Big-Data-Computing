All confirmed cases in this study were tested with a positive SARS-CoV-2 reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and extracting data from the Beijing Municipal Health Commission (June 11 to July 6, 2020). We selected the 103 typical confirmed cases (excluding imported cases) between June 12 and June 15 for statistical analysis and explored differences among different clinical cases. A cluster of COVID-19 was reported in Beijing between June 12 and June 15, 2020, involving 103 confirmed cases. Patients aged 21 to 65 years old and the mean age was 42.38 \u00b1 11.507, the male-to-female sex ratio was 1.40:1. All confirmed cases had a direct or indirect exposure history in the Beijing Xinfadi Market (BXM), and the clinical manifestations of 97% confirmed cases was diagnosed as mild or moderate. Different clinical classification in age (P = .041), exposure history (P = .025), fever (P = .020), and cough (P = .000) were the statistically significant difference, but there was no statistically significant difference in gender (P = .501), the type of diagnosis (P = .478), expectoration (P = .979), fatigue (P = .906), dizziness or headache (P = .848), muscle pain (P = .825), sore throat or throat discomfort (P = .852), chills (P = .933), diarrhea (P = .431) and runny nose or nasal congestion (P = .898). This study shows that Beijing's epidemic scope was mainly concentrated in the Xinfadi Market. The initial cases were epidemiologically related to the BXM, the clinical classification of most cases was mild and moderate, and the differences in age, exposure history, fever, and cough among different clinical cases were statistically significant.",

[1] It has been one of the most dreaded, recent pandemics impacting multifarious global sectors, including education. [2] [3] [4] In early December 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China. [5] After the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, China met the challenge of COVID-19 by essentially mobilizing \"everything.\" Taking what has been described as a whole-of-government, wholeof-society approach, [6] such as locking down Wuhan city, establishing a Leading Group by the central government, raising the public health emergency response to the highest level in all localities, classifying management of \"four categories of personnel\", makeshift hospitals in operation, pairing assistance, and launching massive community screening. China has achieved remarkable results in the fight against COVID-19 through the concerted efforts of all its people. On April 8, 2020, Wuhan lifted the 76-day control measures on the passageways between China and Hubei. Since April 29, 2020, the epidemic situation in China has been sporadic on the whole, with sporadic cases causing clusters in some areas. Imported cases from abroad have been basically brought under control, the positive momentum of the epidemic situation has been consolidated, and epidemic prevention and control across China has become normal. [7] As of June 10 at 0:00, 2020, Beijing, the capital of China, has also reported no new confirmed cases for 56 consecutive days. [8] But on June 11, locally transmitted cases have suddenly appeared in Beijing, this new infection cluster lasted 26 days and had a direct or indirect connection with the BXM (Beijing Xinfadi Market, which sells a wide range of agricultural, meat and seafood products has extensive logistics and intensive personnel). After the new infection cluster outbreak, Beijing has adopted a series of measures to control the pandemic and achieved zero Editor: Gunjan Arora.",

He reported that he had visited the Xinfadi Market (XM) before the onset of the disease. Since that, a new infection cluster emerged in BXM and as of July 6, a total of 333 locally transmitted COVID-19 confirmed cases were reported. [9] We selected 103 locally transmitted COVID-19 confirmed cases between June 12 and June 15 in Beijing for analysis (see Table S1 , Supplemental Content, http://links.lww.com/MD/G327, which illustrates the specific information of 103 locally transmitted COVID-19 confirmed cases). Among 103 locally transmitted COVID-19 confirmed cases, there were 14 cases of household registration in Beijing and 89 cases in other provinces, and including 60 males and 43 females. All of them were directly or indirectly exposed to the BXM. [10] [11] [12] [13] Figure 1 showed the trend of new confirmed cases between June 11 and July 6, 2020, in Beijing. During the early new infection cluster outbreak, new confirmed cases increased rapidly and reached the peak on June 14. After June 14, new confirmed cases decreased fluctuate and had achieved zero reported on July 6 in Beijing. Table 1 showed that among Beijing's 103 new confirmed cases, 60 were males (58.3%) and 43 were females (41.7%). The mean age was 42.38 \u00b1 11.507 years old (range, from 21 to 65). The cases were mainly confirmed through seeking medical advice actively (41) and traceability screening (60). All the new confirmed cases had a direct or indirect exposure history in the BXM, and mainly working (69) and purchasing (28) in BXM. The clinical classification of cases was mild or moderate, accounting for 97%. Mild cases were 38 (36.9%) with the age range from 25 to 58, and moderate cases were 62 (60.2%) with the age range from 21 to 65. Different clinical classification in age (P = .041) and exposure history (P = .025) were statistically significant differences, while there were no statistically significant differences in gender (P = .501) and diagnosis way (P = .478). Table 2 showed that 103 patients had obvious COVID-19 clinical symptoms, mainly including fever, sore throat or throat discomfort, fatigue, cough, and other symptoms. The symptom of fever were 34 cases (33%), sore throat or throat discomfort were 20 cases (19.4%), fatigue was 15 cases (14.6%), and sputum cough(2 cases), chills (4 cases), and diarrhea (4 cases). A different classification in fever (P = .020) and cough (P = .000) had a statistically significant difference.",

Therefore, first, strict closed management should be applied to the place such as supervision, old-age care, welfare, and mental health in Beijing, especially for the elderly, focusing on the prevention and control of imported COVID-19 and internal disease transmission. Second, wearing masks when in close contact with people <1 m away, also in closed and crowded places. Especially it was important for those working in medical and health institutions and public service workers. Third, strengthening ventilation in crowded places. When it is not necessary, parties and gatherings should be avoided, and people should be strictly prevented from gathering. When carrying out activities, people should keep their social distance at least 1 meter.",

The main symptoms of 103 COVID-19 cases were fever, cough, fatigue, and so forth, but some patients had no obvious clinical symptoms in the past 14 days. So in order to control the epidemic, the following steps can be implemented. First, strengthening the body temperature detection of people in public places, adjusting the proportion of traffic restriction and controlling the full load rate. Doing well in disinfection, ventilation, temperature detection, wearing masks, setting up observation areas, handing over of passengers with fever and information registration. Second, under level 2 response, requiring people to check their temperatures and health codes before entering the closed communities. Outsiders and cars were forbidden to enter the communities, sub-districts, streets in high/medium-risk areas, and communities of high-risk sub-districts implemented closedoff management, allowing no one to leave. Third, all those personnel and close contacts who have been to Xinfadi, Yuquan East, Tiantao Honglian Market, and other key areas in the past 14 days were required to test, and the testing scope expanded to ensure that all tests are performed. Fourth, all students in primary, junior high, and senior high schools resumed online teaching. College students should stop returning to campus, and flexible working such as telecommute and off-peak work should be encouraged. [18] [19] [20] [21] There are some limitations in the present study that clinical symptom indicators may be further improved, some deterioration in clinical signs, and symptoms of patients and genetic characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 in the new epidemic should be further explored. Nevertheless, our study timely demonstrated the specific information of 103 confirmed cases between June 12 and June 15 in BXM and the materials of this study were a novelty. When the first confirmed case was reported in Beijing on June 11, 2020, the number of confirmed cases has been increasing at a double-digit rate for 8 consecutive days.",
