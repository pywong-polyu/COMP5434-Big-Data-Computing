Several works published recently and based on more than 100 studies attempt to propose such cut off for Ct value and duration of eviction with a consensus at approximately Ct > 30 and at least 10 days, respectively [2] [3] [4] [5] . However, in an article published in this journal, a group reported that patients could be not be contagious above 25 Ct as the virus was not detected in culture above this Ct [6]. This limit was then evoked in the French media during the interview with the member of the French Scientific Council Covid-19 as a possible value above which patients are no longer contagious [7]. At the beginning of the outbreak, we correlated the Ct values obtained by our PCR technique based on the amplification of the E gene and the results of the culture [8]. Since the beginning of the epidemic, we have performed in our institute 250,566 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR for 179,151 patients, of which 13,161 (7.3%) tested positive. Up to the end of May, 3 790 of these samples reported positives on naso-pharyngeal samples were inoculated and managed for culture as previously described [8]. Of these 3 790 inoculated samples, 1941 SARS-Cov-2",

The correlation between the scanner values and the positivity of the culture allows us to observe that the image obtained with ten times more isolates than our preliminary work (1941 versus 129) does not change significantly (Figure 1 ). It can be observed that at Ct=25, up to 70% of patients remain positive in culture and that at Ct=30 this value drops to 20%. At Ct=35, the value we used to report positive result for PCR, less than 3% of culture are negative. Our Ct value of 35 initially based on the results obtained by RT-PCR on control negative samples in A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 3 our laboratory and initial results of cultures [8] is validated by the present work and is in correlation with what was proposed i.e. in Korea [9] or Taiwan [10] . We could observe that subcultures, especially the first one, allow increasing percentage of viral isolation on high Ct samples, confirming that these high Ct are mostly correlated with low viral loads. From our cohort, we now need to try to understand and define the duration and frequency of live virus shedding in patients on a case-by-case basis, in the rare cases where the PCR is positive beyond 10 days, often at a Ct above 30. In any cases, these rare cases should not impact public health decisions.",

At the beginning of the outbreak, we correlated the Ct values obtained by our PCR technique based on the amplification of the E gene and the results of the culture [8]. Since the beginning of the epidemic, we have performed in our institute 250,566 SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR for 179,151 patients, of which 13,161 (7.3%) tested positive. Up to the end of May, 3 790 of these samples reported positives on naso-pharyngeal samples were inoculated and managedfor culture as previously described[8]. Of these 3 790 inoculated samples, 1941 SARS-Cov-2 isolates could be obtained after the first inoculation or up to 2 blind subcultures. The correlation between the scanner values and the positivity of the culture allows us to observe that the image obtained with ten times more isolates than our preliminary work (1941 versus 129) does not change significantly(Figure 1). It can be observed that at Ct=25, up to 70% of patients remain positive in culture and that at Ct=30 this value drops to 20%. At Ct=35, the value we used to report positive result for PCR, less than 3% of culture are negative.
