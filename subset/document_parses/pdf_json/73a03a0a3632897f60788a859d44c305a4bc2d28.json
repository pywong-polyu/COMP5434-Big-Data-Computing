Informing people about the collective benefit of vaccination has great potential in increasing vaccination intentions. This research investigates the potential for engaging experiences in immersive virtual reality (VR) to strengthen participants' understanding of community immunity, and therefore, their intention to get vaccinated. In a pre-registered lab-in-the-field intervention study, participants were recruited in a public park (tested: n = 232 , analyzed: n = 222 ). They were randomly assigned to experience the collective benefit of community immunity in a gamified immersive virtual reality environment ( 2 (1-7 scale) . The study employs a crossover design (participants later received a second treatment), but the primary outcome is the effect of the first treatment on vaccination intention. After the VR treatment, for participants with less-than-maximal vaccination intention, intention increases by 9.3 points (95% CI: 7.0 to OPEN 1",

Our participants reported greater fun with the VR treatment than with the text-and-image treatment. Previous research has shown that immersive VR increases participants' interest in the content domain 25 and enjoyment 26 , which can increase attention and effort 18 to understand a www.nature.com/scientificreports/ topic. Immersive simulations also induce a sense of presence 17 and agency, which are essential for experiencing embodiment (the feeling of being in and controlling a virtual body) 27 . This can cause participants to associate negative and positive emotions with low and high vaccination rates, respectively. All of these features make it possible to create intense experiences of scenarios from another person's perspective-increasing empathy with vulnerable others by allowing users to share their emotional processes 28 . Such effects are likely to further increase when elements of gamification are used 23 , as in the present study. Taken together, there are both cognitive and emotional features of the VR treatment that are likely influence behavioral intentions. The current research has some limitations. Firstly, because is difficult to differentiate between mechanisms, it is currently unclear which aspects of the intervention may be modified by practitioners, and which ones must be kept. In future work, we will further investigate the mechanisms behind the effect of this intervention type, by developing more versions of the simulation, and measuring more intermediate variables (e.g., empathy).",

Further, despite the fact that the study was advertised as a \"VR experiment on COVID-19\", with no mention of vaccines or advocacy, it is possible that participants anticipated our objectives. This means that individuals with strong (anti-)vaccine beliefs may have declined to take part. Indeed, the strength of our invention lies in motivating the vaccine-hesitant to engage with vaccine-related content, rather than in persuading strong vaccine deniers.",

For vaccine and community immunity information in particular, it is crucial to reach and engage healthy members of the population (including young adults).
