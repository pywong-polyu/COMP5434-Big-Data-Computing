The ambulance attendance for substance and/or alcohol use in a pandemic (ASAP) study explores incidents during the COVID-19 lockdown in the East Midlands region of the United Kingdom (23 March-4 July 2020). Method. Retrospective cross-sectional count per day of ambulance attendances from the East Midlands Ambulance Service Trust. Ambulance attendances relating to alcohol or other drug use in the year prior, during lockdown and weeks following, were examined using interrupted time series analysis by patient demographics and geographical location. Results. A total of 36 104 records were identified (53.7% male, 84.5% ethnicity classified as White, mean age 38.4 years). A significant drop in the number of attendances per day at the start of lockdown (\u00c025.24, confidence interval \u00c0 38.16, \u00c012.32) was observed, followed by a gradual increase during the ongoing lockdown period (0.36, confidence interval 0.23, 0.46). Similar patterns were found across genders, age groups 16-64 and urban/rural locations. Discussion and Conclusion. The pattern of ambulance attendances for alcohol or other drug use changed during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Lockdown significantly affected the use of ambulances for incidents involving alcohol or other drug use, impacting on health-care services. Further research into hazardous use of alcohol or other drugs during the lockdown periods is needed to inform policy, planning and public health initiatives.

This is in addition to a change in the market, for example, people substituting heroin for other substances and less demand for recreational 'club' drugs such as MDMA [6] . People who use illicit substances and/or alcohol may be at greater risk of experiencing severe symptoms of COVID-19 due to poorer health and lower immunity, and pose a greater risk of transmitting the virus due to needing to travel to obtain substances [7, 8] .",

Their findings illustrated the increase in opioid overdoses following this declaration resulting in a 17% increase in the number of attendances with subsequent transport to hospital, a 71% increase in attendances where transportation to hospital was refused, and a 50% increase where the attendance was associated with a death at the scene.

The abrupt drop in attendances may have been due to the closing of nightlife venues such as bars and clubs, availability of substances and/or the general public's fear of calling an ambulance during a national pandemic as suggested in previous studies [28, 30] . The increase however, may demonstrate the issue of hazardous AOD that may occur due to lockdown enforcement resulting in lack of social connection, isolation, financial and occupational stress, and overall psychological distress [4, 12] as well as the potential change in substance use or purity of these during the pandemic. However, this study did not examine how or why AOD use was occurring and further exploration is needed to examine any connection. The rate of increase during the lockdown at which the ambulance service was required to attend to incidents relating to AOD demonstrated the ongoing impact of AOD on this service during this time.",

The age group with the highest number of people in treatment for AOD in 2016/2017 was 35-39 years, with non-opiate use tending to be younger (25-29 years) and alcohol use tending to be older (45-49 years) [12] .

The initial decline suggests there may have been a change in behaviour or in ambulance service response. The increase in attendances during lockdown suggests it may have impacted on hazardous AOD. The reasons for this are still to be explored although may be linked to the psychological and economic distress caused by the pandemic, the availability of substances, and the fear of using health services. Those who live in urban and more deprived areas are likely to request ambulance attendances at a greater rate than those in rural and less deprived areas [15] . This may be useful for planning of ambulance care in relation to geographical need, and training for ambulance crew responding to AOD incidents.
