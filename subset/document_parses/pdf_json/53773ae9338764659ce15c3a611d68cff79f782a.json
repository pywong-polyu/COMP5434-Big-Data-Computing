Different assays demonstrate 41-45% of diagnostic sensitivities and 91-98% of specificities, with substantial agreement (89.3-91.2%), but a high percentage of weak positive results (13-22%) was observed with ICTs. ICTs performances were comparable to those of automated immunoassays. ICTs could have a role as screening approach due to their easy usability.

Although the WHO does not clearly endorse their use for patient management, interest is raising around these devices, mainly supported by their easy usability [2, 3] . The aim of this study was to compare diagnostic performances of three rapid immunochromatographic tests with those of an automated ELISA and CLIA immunoassays, in order to evaluate their potential usefulness as diagnostic and/or epidemiological tools.",

            "text": "Large variability among the positivity rates of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM has been observed: in the first 8/10 days after symptoms onset, assays sensitivities were lower than 50% even if IgG/IgM/IgA positive results were combined [6] . Sensitivities reached 90-95% after 14 days of disease, but patients number included in this group was too low to be statistically significant. When assays performance has been analyzed according to disease stage, VivaDiag was the best ICT for IgM detection, with a positivity rate increasing from 10 to 95% from early to late stage. PRIMA Professional failed to detect any IgM positive sample in early stage and identified only 24% of positive samples in the late phase. COVID-19 IgG/IgM Rapid Test Cassette displayed a diagnostic performance comparable to that of VivaDiag, except for lower IgM sensitivity in late stage. Compared to CLIA-MAGLUMI, ICT tests displayed an overall better sensitivity, with the exception of PRIMA Professional whose performance was rather limited. With respect to IgG, substantial agreement between ELISA Euroimmun and CLIA-MAGLUMI has been already reported [7] . Among ICTs, PRIMA Professional showed the best performance with a positivity rate increasing from 5% (early phase) to 66% (intermediate) and 95% (late stage). Compared with the automated immunoassays, the ability of ICTs to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG was equivalent to that of CLIA-MAGLUMI and better than ELISA-Euroimmun, whose IgG positive rates ranged between 0 and 86% at 14 days after symptoms onset.",

First, ICT assays are plagued by subjective interpretation which may be difficult with weak positive bands: between 13 and 22% of IgG results were classified as \"weak\" in our study. Second, none of the ICT evaluated clearly declared the characteristics of the antigens used and/or the target viral protein(s), and this represents a foremost caveats in assessing the neutralizing activity of the specific anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies detected. This study has some limitations. First, patients were retrospectively identified, and thereby further prospective studies would be needed to validate our preliminary findings. Then, about half of blood samples from COVID-19 confirmed cases had been collected in the early stage, when antibodies are usually absent, thus partially impacting the diagnostic sensitivity. Finally, assays' specificities were deduced from a limited number of healthy volunteers who may not represent specificities obtained using sera from patients with other diseases.",
