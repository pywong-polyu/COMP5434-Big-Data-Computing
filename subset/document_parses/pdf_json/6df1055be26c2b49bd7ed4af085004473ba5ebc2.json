Many pharmaceuticals work by enhancing or inhibiting components of the cell communication mechanisms (1, 2) . The formation of filamentous (F)-actin rich tubules termed tunneling nanotubes (TNTs) are one such mechanism of communication between the cells (3, 4) . TNTs have been broadly defined as thin membrane tubes which connect two cells and mediate the transfer of cellular cargo (5, 6) . A recent review has added more detail to this definition, stating that TNTs must satisfy three requirements: they must connect two or more cells, be composed of F-actin, and not come in contact with the substrates that pass through them (7) . In this review, we use the more specific definition to differentiate TNTs from similar but distinct structures.",

They form gap-like junctions between connected cells and mediate the exchange of cytoplasmic proteins, cellular organelles (such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi, endosome, lysosome, mitochondria), lipids, nucleic acids, microRNA, ions, calcium, and several other components (4, (8) (9) (10) . The diameter of the TNT restricts the type of cargo that can be transported. Thinner TNTs contain F-actin and are less than 7 \u00b5m in diameter which prevents them from transferring large organelles between cells (11) . Thicker TNTs contain microtubules and exceed a 7 \u00b5m diameter which allows them to transfer organelles such as mitochondria between cells (6, 12) . They facilitate both short and long-distance direct communication, spanning distances of up to 300 \u00b5m (13) . TNTs are able to polymerize and depolymerize rapidly in 30-60 seconds, making them fluid, transient structures (8, 14) . TNTs have been shown to be formed by different cell types including epithelial and fibroblasts (15) (16) (17) , neuronal (18, 19) , and multiple types of immune cells (20) .",

Filopodia, like TNTs, can form long range intercellular bridges (25) . However, TNT structures are direct cytoplasm-to-cytoplasm bridges and can be much larger than the~2.37-5.8 uM of filopodia (3, 26) . Viruses, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can induce the formation of filopodia in dendritic cells and use them to surf onto connected naive cells (6, 27, 28) . It was previously hypothesized that TNTs are a subsect of filopodia; but recent evidence suggests otherwise. For example, TNTs are free-floating while filopodia are connected to the cell plate. Unlike TNTs, filopodia are unable to mediate vesicular transport. Furthermore, the regulatory mechanisms to produce filopodia and TNTs work in direct opposition (29) . In fact, when a cell encounters a TNT, it retracts its existing filopodia (29) . Differential signaling pathways involved in TNT and filopodia formation are discussed below. Overall, the evidence suggests that while filopodia and TNTs are similar in structure, they are in fact separate entities.",

Delage et al., 2016 reported that CDC42, IRSp53, and VASP form a complex which inhibits TNT formation and vesicular transport (29) . Interestingly, these cellsignaling molecules have been shown to promote filopodia formation (30, 31) . Conversely, Eps8 overexpression was shown to increase the extent of TNT connections and vesicular transport. Hypothesized mechanisms for this phenomenon suggest that Eps8 works synergistically with IRSp53 to bundle actin (32) . Thus, IRSp53 plays a major regulatory role in inducing or inhibiting TNT formation. Furthermore, it shows how the formation of filopodia and TNTs can utilize opposing signaling routes.",

Cells induce TNT formation first by activating p53 which subsequently upregulates epidermal growth factor (EGF). EGF activates the Akt/PI3k/ mTOR pathway to induce the actin polymerization necessary for TNT production (33) . This process is likely mediated through M-sec, a protein known to affect the cytoskeleton that was discovered when examining microfold or M-cells of the intestine (16) . Upregulation of M-sec induced the formation of TNTs, and knock-out M-sec models decreased TNT formation by as much as one third (16) . M-sec has been shown to work with Ras associated small GTPase RalA which has been shown to be involved with actin cytoskeletal rearrangement (16, 34) . Since TNTs are composed of mainly F-actin, the RalA-M-sec interaction may mediate TNT formation.",

Overexpression of Rab35, a small GTPase involved in membrane recycling, induces TNT formation while inhibition of TNTs occurs with the addition of a dominant negative mutant of Rab35 (35) . ACAP2, a downstream effector of Rab35, was shown to positively regulate TNT formation using a similar approach (35) . ACAP2 does so through the inhibition of ARF6 which allows PI4P to recruit EHD1 (35) . Loss of EHD1 reduces TNT production, suggesting a linear pathway by which Rab35-ACAP2-ARF6-EHD1 regulate TNTs in neuronal cells (35) . In addition to the Rab35 pathway, Wnt signaling initiates TNT formation in neuronal cells. The addition of Wnt7a to CAD cells stimulates TNT production via the Wnt/ Ca 2+ pathway (36) . CAD cells have been demonstrated to transfer a-syn fibrils using Wnt-induced TNTs (36) .",

            "text": "In general, the TNTs formation are preferentially driven by the activation of Rho GTPase signaling with the polymerization of the filamentous actin at the cellular tip (14, 38) . The actin rich filopodia-like protrusions make the bridges of TNTs by contacting the target cells. In the proposed model the filopodia from the viral infected cells starts forming TNTs ( Figure 2A , panel a) (39) . In contrast, in case of murine leukemia virus it is the uninfected cell that initiates the TNT formation ( Figure 2A , panel b) (17) . In the literature TNT can also be formed when a cell that is adhered to another cell starts moving away leaving the retracted actin rich TNTs between the cells (Figure 2A , panel c) (40) . Using time-lapse microscopy both of the above mechanisms of TNT formation have also been reported in context with immune cells. For example, F-actin polymerization driven process is observed in dendritic cells, when the filopodia of two retracting cells turn into TNTs to maintain contact between the two cells. Interestingly, macrophages, are reported to use either of these mechanisms to form TNTs (40) . Depending on the cytoplasmic connectivity between the TNT either from the donor and or recipient cell, they are further classified as closedend and or open-end TNTs ( Figure 2B , panels a-c) (6) . Current model further suggests that actin containing TNT are shorter and thinner compared to TNTs containing tubulin alone or together with actin. The later type of TNTs rich in both actin and tubulin are widely documented (39) . The ability of a given cell to form only one type or from multiple other types of TNTs remains unknown. In addition, the mechanism and the triggers are uniquely associated with the given TNTs are the same or they vary depending on cell type (38) . However, the associated triggers such as heparanase upregulation, hypoxia, calcium signaling, ROS during inflammation may have profound effect on TNT biogenesis in the circulating immune cells, which in tuns may fastens the dissemination of the virus to affect multiple organs and contribute towards the associated pathologies ( Figure 3) . Interestingly, the properties of TNTs can vary from cell to cell. For instance, TNTs in T cells have very low permeability to calcium and contain distinct membrane linkages when compared to TNTs in macrophages (12, 41) . Additionally, TNT produced in SCC cells are 2 times thicker and 2.5 times larger in length then those of PC12 cells (37) . Furthermore, the SCC TNTs contain microtubules in contrast PC12 TNTs which only contain F-actin.",

It is believed that widely spaced cells in cornea communicate using TNTs (42) . Confocal imaging has also provided unique evidence that TNT mediates connection between the inflammatory macrophages (43) . It has also been suggested that TNT plays a rescue role in improving ocular pathologies such as and elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) (10, 44) . For instance, macrophage mediate the transfer of cystinosin lysosomes from healthy donor cells to diseased cells via TNTs (44) . The study lays the foundation that TNTs may serve as a tool to deliver the drug during transplantation with healthy donor cells in the cornea. Similarly, blockage of trabecular meshwork (TM) cells results in a higher IOP -a risk factor for glaucoma. In this regard, it has been shown that TM cells communicate via TNTs as a sensing mechanism during changes in IOP and cellular remodeling to allow additional aqueous fluid to normalize the eye pressure. In support, it has been shown that TM cells in glaucoma have prolonged TNT connections compared to normal TM cells (45) . In retinal cells, the use of TNTs has been implicated in the transfer of the mitochondria.",

With heart failure ranking as a top contributor of cardiac death in industrialized nations, research exploring the regenerative potential of cardiomyocytes has become critical in understanding post-infarction recovery of cardiac tissue (47) . Though cardiac tissue itself has limited regenerative capacity, studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) potentiate cardiomyocyte regeneration through cell-to-cell communication that includes paracrine signaling pathways and nanotubular connections (47) . Utilizing co-culture models of rat cardiomyocytes, Figeac et al., 2014 explored the interaction between TNT-mediated communication processes and paracrine signaling of MSCs in response to cardiomyocyte (CM) injury. The researchers identified cross-talk between the two routes of communication, with TNTs mediating interaction between damaged CMs and human multipotent adipose derived stem cells (hMADS) and also altering the MSC secretome to influence the release of angiogenic growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and additional recruitment of bone marrow-derived MSCs (47) . Other co-culture studies have shown the ability of nanotubular structures to directly facilitate differentiation of endothelial progenitor stem cells into cardiomyocytes (48) . Mitochondria and cytoplasmic GFP travel along nanotubular tracts bridging neonatal rat CMs and undifferentiated adult human endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) (48) . This unidirectional transfer of macromolecular complexes was followed by differentiation of EPCs in vitro (48) . In conditions of ischemic injury, Cselenya\u1e31 et al., 2010 also demonstrated TNTmediated mitochondrial transfer (49) . Creating an in vitro ischemic model using H9c2 cardiomyoblasts, these researchers showed that nanotubular connections (200-500 nm wide) between MSCs and injured cardiomyoblasts functioned to facilitate organelle transfer, resulting in rescue of damaged cells (49) . While TNTs have been implicated in connecting MSCs and CMs and facilitating unidirectional exchange of macromolecules and organelles, nanotubular tracts have also been discovered between major cardiac cell types as a means of long distance cell-to-cell communication (50) . It is thought that such structures enable bidirectional mitochondrial exchange and propagation of electrical potential via Ca2+ signaling (50) .",

In addition to protecting the viral components from the extracellular environment, utilizing TNTs to propagate infection is more energetically favorable than conventional methods. The production of viral components, such as a viral genome and the various proteins involved in budding, host cell binding, and fusion can be avoided by inserting viral genomes directly into the cytoplasm of a host cell ( Figure 4A ). Additionally, TNT transport is significantly faster than extracellular transport. Mitochondria that contain infectious materials have been recorded traveling 7 nm/sec (37) . The speed of transport combined with rapid rate of TNT polymerization (0.2 mm/ second), makes TNT travel vastly more efficient (20, 53) . TNTs are also incredibly large, having diameters upward of 200 nm, and can accommodate large macromolecules and cellular organelles (3) . In addition to transporting viral components ( Table 1) , they can also be used as a track for virions to surf on, reducing the time it takes to spread from cell to cell (17, 59) . For example, the formation of TNTs between epithelial cells and fibroblasts is likely to disseminate herpesviruses over long distances (54) .

Intracellular viral spread via TNTs provides critical protection from circulating immune cells and avoids virus-cell interactions that may alert host defenses. Furthermore, TNTs allow for infectious particles that initially attach to non-permissive cells to spread to vulnerable cells and promote infection ( Figure 5 ). Understanding the mechanisms of TNT utilization for effective viral infection is vital for better treatment of human pathogens. An understanding of TNTs may also elucidate mechanisms by which viruses are able to remain dormant inside a host, effectively avoiding immune and pharmaceutical targeting. Herpesviruses Herpesviruses cause many diseases in humans from blistering diseases to encephalopathy and blindness. Accordingly, herpesviruses have always been the focus of intense research to form antiviral drugs. Unfortunately, drugs like acyclovir are useful only after infections have begun (60) . These antivirals prevent further viral replication to decrease the number of outbreaks but cannot cure the disease and allow for the virus to remain dormant in the trigeminal ganglia. One mechanism that may make treating this affliction more difficult is the viral utilization of TNT networks. Using fluorescently labeled viral proteins and time-lapse confocal microscopy, a recent study demonstrated that herpesviruses receive protective benefits via travel by TNTs (54) . Despite the presence of neutralizing antibodies, alpha-herpesvirus BoHV-1 (bovine herpesvirus 1) is capable of transmitting viral particles and cellular organelles along TNTs produced by bovine primary fibroblasts and oropharynx cells (KOP) (54) . The viral kinase US3 of pseudorabies virus (PRV) was sufficient to form a very stable TNT which lasted up to 24 hours (58, 61) . Furthermore, the infected cells were shown to spread the virus via TNTs to uninfected cells. Although US3 protein is conserved among ",

            "text": "Human macrophages were first shown to increase TNT production upon HIV infection, and TNT production was correlated with viral replication (12) . HIV particles also have been found inside TNTs during infection (12) . Interestingly, both extracellular surfing and intracellular endocytic transfer of the virions were observed. These findings suggest that HIV has evolved a mechanism to upregulate TNT to facilitate the spread of infection. The virus hijacks TNTs to shuttle virions between cells. While HIV can induce formation of TNT in macrophages, HIV-infected T cells do not increase TNT production (41) . Nonetheless, the virus still uses TNTs to travel between and infect T cells (41) . The mechanism by which HIV induces TNT formation in blood monocyte-derived macrophages requires the HIV accessory protein Nef and the cellular protein M-Sec (22) . Nef interacts with the Rho GTPase RalA and the exocyst complex during this process. Nef-deficient HIV could not induce macrophages to produce TNTs (22) . This signaling pathway also contains M-sec as it was impeded in a cloned cell line lacking M-sec. By using a small molecule which inhibits M-Sec mediated TNT production, researchers were able to reduce HIV infection by half (22) . This reduction was not seen in Nef-deficient mutant HIV-1 or in a CD4 + T cell line which is deficient in M-Sec (22) . These results support the existence of a Nef-M-sec signaling pathway that is vital for TNT formation and subsequent viral release. In addition, it has also been demonstrated that Nef association with the Rac1/Cdc42 effector p21-activated kinase 2 (PAK2) along with the exocyst complex leads to upregulation of MyoX, which is required for TNT induction (68, 69) . Therefore, it has been suggested that Nef protein is able to hijack the cell's sensing and intercellular-communication machinery by increasing MyoX-dependent TNT formation (69) . Although, the overall cause of the trigger during Nef mediated TNT formation is not clear, mass spectrometry analysis of Nef immunocomplexes from Jurkat cells have recognized exocyst complex proteins as a critical effector of Nef-mediated enhancement of TNT formation (69) . Interestingly, a recent study also showed that HIV and Mycobacterium tuberculosis in a co-infection model trigger the TNT formation via IL-10/STAT-3 signaling (11). Tuberculosis-associated microenvironments during an HIV infection induce the upregulation of the Siglec-1 receptor protein which associates with thick TNTs (70) . TNTs containing Siglec-1 were more likely to carry HIV proteins and more stable than thinner TNTs (70) .",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 induced surface disruption at the level of the host cell's actin cytoskeleton legitimizes the potential that other surface perturbations, such as the eruption of F-actin containing TNT bridges at the cell surface, may assist SARS-CoV-2 widespread dissemination. In fact, previous studies have shown that the cytoskeleton network plays an important role during the entry, replication, and maturation process of coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 6 ) (79, 88, 89) . A recent study by Caldas et al., 2020 provided the first evidence of the SARS-CoV-2 mediated viral surfing on filopodium and the occurrence of a thin (< 0.7 mm) strand of F-actin containing tunneling nanotube (TNT) using high resolution electron microscopy (79) . Viral particles adhered to cell surface protrusions that were shown to connect two cells. This observation suggests viral \"cell surfing\" previously described by other enveloped viruses such as HIV and human metapneumovirus. This mechanism is presumed to allow the in vivo penetration of viruses in mucosal surfaces that display microvilli-rich cells. SARS-CoV-2 infected cells have also recently been found to have strong upregulation of casein kinase II (CK2), a protein kinase that induces phosphorylation of cytoskeleton protein targets like a-catenin and motor protein myosin IIa (83) . In this study, Bouhaddou et al., 2020 demonstrates that SARS-CoV-2 infected cells produced longer actin-rich, CK2-containing filopodia than those filopodia found on noninfected cells, and that these infected cell filopodia possessed viral particles within themselves (83) . Possible TNT activity has also been found in the topographic changes to the surface of cells infected with related betacoronavirus SARS-CoV, namely in the collection of progeny virus particles prepared by Golgi sacs for export to the external surface of the cell (88) . Viral progeny, while frequently disseminated from hijacked cells via exocytosis, may also collect in these localized regions for transport via actin-rich bridges, like TNTs, across cells. Similarly, other single-stranded RNA viruses have demonstrated TNT developmental behaviors, including the gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) which has been found to induce F-actin polymerization, or protrusive growths from the cell surface, and SARS-CoV and murine hepatitis virus, which induce cell membrane interruptions and filopodia formation like the CK2 protrusions off SARS-CoV-2 infected cells (89) . This evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2, like many of the viruses to which it is related, uses TNTs to propagate its pathogenesis, which may offer some insights into its ability to affect multiple organs and cause a diverse array of complications throughout the body. The benefit of understanding TNT formation by SARS-CoV-2 may also have further clinical significance. For instance, when analyzing the treatment of a systemic inflammatory disease known as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and sepsis with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), TNTs have been found to enhance MSC mitochondrial transfer, improving macrophage oxidative phosphorylation and phagocytosis and strengthening the body's immune response to invading pathogens within cells (90) . Because SARS-CoV-2 has been associated with similar inflammatory syndromes, better referred to as multisystem inflammatory syndrome in adults and children (MIS-A and MIS-C, respectively), identifying viral TNT development in infected cells offers a target for mitigating viral spread between cells and slowing disease advancement (91) . Furthermore, it could also offer a new and highly-cell specific means of distributing therapeutic treatments through the nanotubules themselves. Taken together, understanding hijacking of a host cell by SARS-CoV-2 is a critical step toward developing effective therapeutics and prophylactics.",

A recent study by Zhang et al., 2020 found that a collection of FDA-approved drugs was effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 cell entry at distinct steps (81) . These drugs included Mitoxantrone, Raloxifene, and Piceatannol, which are known to bind to heparan sulfate. Similarly, drugs such as Sunitinib, BNTX, and Tilorone target the actin cytoskeleton and lysosomes (81) . Since these drugs target heparan sulfate and actin cytoskeleton receptors during virus entry and trafficking, it is logical that they may inhibit virus transfer via TNTs. In fact, the co-culture of cells expressing spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2, along with the cells expressing human ACE-2 and heparan sulfate especially at the tips, resulted in induction of the widely distributed TNTs between cells (Figure 7) . The presence of TNTs during SARS-CoV-2 infection is supported by an upregulation of casein kinase II (CK2) (89) and heparan sulfate (87) ",

In a study by Wang and Gerdes, UV light-damaged pheochromocytoma cells co-cultured with undamaged cells avoided apoptosis (93) . The damaged cells received mitochondria through TNTs, and although they released cytochrome c from the damaged mitochondria, they did not activate the caspase-3 apoptosis pathway (93) . To further demonstrate TNTs role in this process, cells with defective nanotube formation could not inhibit apoptosis (94) . The transfer of mitochondria from healthy cells to damaged cells via TNTs is beneficial for viruses. Mitochondrial transfer promotes viral survival, factory production, infection rate, and redistribution of mitochondria; overall, leading to an increase in infectious viral particles. For example, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) can not only induce TNT formation in infected cells but also spread to uninfected cells via proteins that associate with mitochondria (94) . The same process that rescues damaged cells ultimately spreads more virus.",

For example, in the B-cell cancer acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), leukemia cells transport signaling molecules through TNTs to communicate with mesenchymal stromal cells and influence the molecules that they release, effectively modifying their environment (95, 96) . The mesenchymal stromal cells secrete the pro-survival signals monocyte chemotactic protein 1, CXCL10, and interleukin 8 to the cancer cells (96) . Interestingly, disrupting TNT formation by targeting actin polymerization disrupts pathogenesis and sensitizes the cells to prednisolone (96) . The ability of cancer cells to communicate with regulatory cells and cytokineproducing cells gives the cancer more power to control its microenvironment. The cells can upregulate the release of progrowth cytokines and induce a more malignant phenotype. It is paramount that future pharmaceuticals consider this component of cancer pathogenesis for new drug development. With cancer causing a significant global health burden, investigations regarding the role of these intimate cytoplasmic bridges have become a promising area for targeted anti-cancer therapies.",

TNTs facilitate homocellular communication between malignant and normal mesothelial cells (97) . TNTs can also mediate the bidirectional exchange of cytosolic membrane components, proteins, and mitochondria (97) . Additional co-culture studies have further explored the impact of TNT-mediated organelle transfer. Mitochondria have reported to be transferred through nanotubular connections (100-200 nm wide) between RT4 (less invasive) and T24 (highly invasive) bladder cancer cells (98) . The researchers linked mitochondrial trafficking resulting in activation of mTOR and downstream signaling pathways to increased invasive potential of RT4 cells (98) . Since the current model of cancer physiology concedes that tumor growth is influenced by complex interactions between cancer cells and various stromal cell types (i.e. mesenchymal stem cells, endothelial cells, fibroblasts, macrophages), cell-to-cell communication structures have become a target of investigation in response to acquired drug resistance (99) . Utilizing ovarian cancer cell lines (SKOV3 and OVCAR3) and breast cancer cell lines (MDA-MB231 and MCF7), Pasquier et al., 2013 identified crosstalk between tumor cells and stromal cells, with nanotubular bridges functioning as a conduit for cell-to-cell communication. Heterocellular mitochondrial transfer facilitated by TNTs was associated with increased chemoresistance in cancer cells (99) . The researchers postulated that mitochondrial trafficking may promote resistance via various mechanisms including prevention of apoptosis, reduced generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and increased rescue of cells with dysfunctional mitochondria (99) . Using in vitro pancreatic and ovarian cancer systems, Desir et al. discovered efflux of doxorubicin (a topoisomerase II inhibitor) mediated by TNTs, with drug-dependent increase in TNT formation (100) . Furthermore, the researchers indicated that nanotubular bridges enabled drug resistance through mechanisms of drug redistribution, in addition to previously studied means of mitochondrial and O-glycoprotein transfer (100) .",

            "text": "It has been shown that cancer cells may develop resistance to chemotherapeutics even without prior exposure to them. One explanation for this phenomenon is that TNTs mediate communications between cancer cells exposed and not exposed to chemotherapeutics which selects for progeny that are resistant. This mechanism of resistance has been demonstrated in pancreatic cancer cells that were harvested from patients and then treated with the popular chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (100) . Doxorubicin induces TNT formation in a dose-dependent fashion as measured by multiphoton fluorescence microscopy. Chemo-sensitive cancer cells could transport doxorubicin to resistant cells via TNTs and vice versa (100) . These results add chemotherapeutics to the long list of cellular stresses able to induce TNT formation but also highlight another method by which cancer cells utilize TNTs. The transfer of drug not only reduces the concentration that the target cells are receiving but also exposes neighboring cells to the effects of doxorubicin at lower dosages. For sensitive cancer cells, TNTs effectively increase the likelihood of survival by lowering the dosage present in the cellular microenvironment (100) . For resistant cells, the transfer of doxorubicin kills sensitive cells, reducing the number of cells competing for nutrients with the resistant subpopulation and increasing the chances of resistant cells reproducing in the next generation (100). While doxorubicin is just one example, this phenomenon likely applies to many pharmaceuticals and should be part of future considerations for cancer treatment.",

Glioblastomas are particularly nasty cancers with a median survival rate of 1 year post diagnosis and a 5-year survival reported at 5-10% in high grade cases (102) . When untreated cells are co-cultured with cells that are treated with temozolomide and radiation therapy, the unexposed cells demonstrated decreased rates of apoptosis upon treatment (103) . This effect is thought to be mediated through connexinlike connections such as those of TNT. Because of the similarities between the cell-cell connections made by connexins and TNTs, it is possible that protection conferred by connexin junctions could also be mediated, over greater distances, with TNTs. For example, the gap junction-mediated transport of Cx43 between dopaminergic neuroblastoma cells has been shown to decrease the efficacy of the parkinsonian toxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridine (MPP + ) (104) . Thus, the transport of numerous cell products or drugs through TNTs may reduce or enhance the effectiveness of certain therapies.",

Similarly, putative TNT formation between the dendritic cells and bone marrow-derived MHC class II (positive) cells in the corneal stroma has also been observed (10, 42, 43) .

Another interesting physiological process where TNT-dependent electrical signaling could attribute its significance is during the wound healing process. Membrane depolarization at the leading edge of wounds has been shown to connect adjacent cells via TNTs activation of PI3 kinase signaling suggesting a supportive role of TNTs in wound healing, which involves F-actin remodeling (118) .

            "text": "The understanding of TNT regulation and function in both physiological and pathological states is of utmost importance in treating many different diseases. The evolution of cells to create TNTs to maximize cellular communications either during homeostasis and or during stress response to improve the cell survival by cargo transport to transferring energy, Ca2+ ions, mRNA and cellular organelles while in parallel evolution of pathogens to adapt and exploit TNTs are equally fascinating outcomes highlighting the TNTs potential which needs to be fully harnessed as a therapeutic target. Further, multiple studies have provided in vivo evidence to support the role of TNTs in pathophysiology and several forms of the disease including their presence between immune cells either in the lymph nodes (20) , and or between the dendritic cells in the mouse cornea (43) . Data generated from various cancer model studies have also provide compelling evidence regarding the contribution of TNTs (5) or capable of crossing the dense tubular basement membrane in the kidney of the cystinosis mouse model (44) or in their cornea and thyroid (43, 122) . One major issue in performing these in vivo and ex vivo studies is the difficulties in identifying the precise nature of the structures and clearly determining their role in the transfer. Nonetheless, data generated from various laboratories reported evidence of TNT-like structures in brain tumors, and in ex vivo hematopoietic stem cells, lung, and ovarian cancers. Also, TNT-like structures were found in human macrophages present in lymph nodes obtained from HIV-infected individuals with HIV reactivation.",

            "text": "The similarities and the differences in the virus transfer via TNTs are also worth noting. As per the current hypothesis during an early phase of viral entry many medically important viruses from different families exploit the bridges of TNTs as a super spreader to move rapidly across long distances (54) . It is widely accepted that many viral infections trigger the activation of highly conserved signaling Rho GTPases dependent Cdc42/Rac-1 pathway (39) . The later event aid in the actin polymerization containing F-actin and the network of microtubules which in turn favors the virus transfer. The absence of microtubules on TNTs supporting viral spread is also documented (39) . Interestingly, TNTs also offer a unique viral surfing platform for viruses to move even on outer extracellular surfaces which could help their movement a lot quicker than the densely rich intracellular environment (12) . This mechanism has been shown in HIV and herpesviruses, but it is quite possible to have similar mechanism exist with other viruses as well. In this process it is quite possible that the ubiquitously expressed heparan sulfate (HS) receptor on TNTs together with the associated fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and integrin signaling may be involved to aid in the viral spread. Although the precise mechanism with the direct receptor involvement on TNTs to promote viral spread remains unknown. In fact, many viral structural proteins have ability to trigger the induction of TNTs (39) , but their formation depends on the interaction of the virus receptor or the viral ligand depending on the infected or the uninfected cell. This could be varied depending on the type of viruses including the target cell. In contrast, the role of non-structural protein to trigger TNTs is also documented which clearly suggest that the involvement multiple other co-factors and possibly ubiquitous HS related signaling event may favor this process. However, it is worth investigating if the virus-induced TNTs could display either a unique marker or an increased expression of pre-existing receptor (HS and other adhesion molecules). Given the fact that many viruses move intracellularly via TNTs it is clear that they all acquire one crucial benefit by being protected against extracellular circulating immune cells, and or pre-existing antibodies or even viral entry blockers. Interestingly TNTs also play a vital role during the viral genome replication or during viral egress. This is evident from the fact that TNTs enables the transfer of the entire virions (example HIV, herpesviruses etc.), individual viral proteins (HIV; p24; herpes envelope glycoprotein E (gE), capsid protein VP26, and tegument protein Us3), as well as the viral genomes (example, influenza virus) to the recipient cells (39, 52) . Therefore, the transfer of complete virus particle and or viral cargos suggest that viruses have evolved a unique mechanism and strategy to spread at multiple stages of the virus life cycle. Nevertheless, it is clear that virus ability to infect and replicate successfully inside host dependent on multiple other factors and TNTs are one of them. One additional interesting question that remains a mystery are the specialized elements of communication involved to benefit the virus via TNTs. In this regard shedding additional light on highly conserved virus-host cell receptor interactions across multiple viruses, identifying exclusive TNTs marker, and developing high resolution in vivo imaging tool will help to understand the role of TNTs in viral infection much better.",

While we currently have the capabilities to inhibit actin polymerization, we must next develop less toxic and more specific inhibitors of TNTs while maintaining normal cellular function. Such therapies would have implications not only in the realm of infectious disease, but also in cancer therapy and in the treatment of neurological disorders. Exploring the signaling, production, locations, and properties of TNTs may also prove to be valuable in understanding the timeline of disease pathogenesis. Examples include a cancer developing resistance to certain therapies or a virus switching methods to spread to na\u00efve cells. Additionally, the ability of certain cells to produce TNTs with specific traits and function may also influence tissue tropism for viruses and other disease-causing agents. Medicine must adapt as we make advances in understanding the complex mechanisms that underlie cellular physiology and pathophysiology. In this way, we can create more comprehensive therapies and produce better outcomes for patients.",

This surfing movement helps the viruses to dock and concentrate at the target cell's surface to facilitate viral attachment and entry.

The larger surface area provided by the TNTs allows for increased viral docking -an opportunity for quick viral transfer to the nearby cells. (c) The viruses may also use TNTs with or without vesicles to transfer their components (nucleic acid, structural proteins) to neighboring cells during the later stages of infection. TNTs allow the viral structural components to avoid contact with the extracellular matrix (ECM) which can expose them to immune cells, proteases, drugs, or nearby active phagocytic cells. (B) Significance of TNTs bridges during virus-host interactions. (a) Actin-rich filopodia aid in viral surfing to reach the target cell. (b) TNT bridges mediate a long-distance transfer or movement of the virions from the initial infected sites to broaden the virus tropism.

            "text": "Tiwari et al. \"TNT\": A New Age in Virus Hijacking Frontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org June 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 680891 alpha herpesviruses (subfamily of herpesviruses), other members of the herpesvirus family, such as gamma herpesviruses exemplified by murine gamma herpesvirus 68 (MHV-68) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), have also been shown to induce and exploit TNT for viral spread using gp48 and ORF58 (62-64). In the above examples, it is believed that herpesvirus proteins affect Rho GTPase signaling to promote the TNT formation (61, 65, 66). This evidence suggests that viral utilization of TNTs must be targeted to best combat these herpesviruses. Influenza is a major cause of mortality even in the developed world (67). Additionally, different strains of the virus emerge each year, some virulent enough to cause pandemics (67). The members of orthomyxoviruses (Influenza A virus and the parainfluenza virus) as well as members of paramyxovirus (measles) families have been shown to induce TNTs to aid in intracellular viral spread and syncytia formation. The virus spread was very meaningful since it happened even in presence of virus neutralizing antibodies or in the presence of a neuraminidase inhibitor (52). Infected cells transferred viral proteins and genomes to uninfected cells via TNTs. This method allowed the virus to evade the inhibitory effects of the antibody and Oseltamivir therapies. However, treatment with Cytochalasin D, an actin polymerization inhibitor, successfully reduced the spread of viral proteins and thus alleviated the infection (52). These results underline the role of TNTs in immune evasion and viral spread during influenza virus infections.",
