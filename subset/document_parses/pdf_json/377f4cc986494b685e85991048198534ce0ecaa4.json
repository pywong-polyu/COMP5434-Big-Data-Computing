            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic is having a major clinical as well as organisational impact on the national health-care system in Italy, particularly in high-volume hospitals which are usually active for many essential clinical needs, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Here, we report major clinical and organisational challenges at a high-volume Italian IBD centre one month after the start of the Italian government's restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. All routine follow-up IBD visits of patients in remission were cancelled or rescheduled for 8-12 weeks' time. However, access to the hospital for therapy or for unstable/relapsing patients was not considered postponable. Everyone attending the centre (e.g. physicians, nurses, administrative personnel and patients) were advised to respect the general recommended rules for hand hygiene and social distancing, to disclose if they had a fever or cough or flu-like symptoms and to wear a surgical mask and gloves. At the entrance of the therapy area, a control station was set up in order to double-check all patients with a clinical interview and conduct thermal scanning. A total of 1451 IBD patients under biotechnological or experimental therapy actively followed in the CEMAD IBD centre were included in the study. About 65% of patients maintained their appointment schedules without major problems, while in 20% of cases planned infusions were delayed because of the patient's decision or practical issues. About 10% of patients receiving subcutaneous therapy were allowed to collect their medicine without a follow-up visit. Finally, 10% of patients living outside the Lazio region requested access to their therapy at a local centre closer to their home. At present, five patients have been found to be positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection but with minimal symptoms, 22 are in 'quarantine' for contact considered to be 'at risk' for the infection. Up to now, none of them has experienced significant symptoms. This study represents the first observational detailed report about short-term impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on patient organisation and management in a high-volume IBD centre.",

            "text": "Since January 2020 (December 2019 in China), coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection has represented a dramatic publichealth emergency both in Italy and worldwide. 1, 2 The high rate of transmission, frequent need for hospitalisation among symptomatic cases ($10%), high requirement for intensive-care management and prominent mortality 1,2 have led to a rapid change in the organisation of the health system at local as well as national and international levels. By mid April, Italy was the most affected country in Europe (more than 115,000 cases), with 55% of confirmed cases requiring hospitalisation, up to 10% requiring admission to intensive care units and a mortality rate close to 10%. 3 Consequently, a governmental regulation on 4 March 2020 established that the entire country be considered a 'red zone', limiting non-essential activities and promoting confinement at home. Accordingly, the logistical organisation of several hospitals all over the country has changed significantly, with huge investment in medical and non-medical resources in order to deal with this emergency. Moreover, to reduce the risk of spreading SARS-CoV-2 infection, access to hospitals has been strictly limited to urgent cases. In this context, the management of chronic diseases, including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), has been critically impacted, with a significant reduction in visits, endoscopic and radiological procedures and multidisciplinary evaluations, modifying the current standard of care for IBD. 4, 5 There are currently only a few reports on IBD patients, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] but no specific recommendations can be given to IBD patients based on direct evidence.",

Furthermore, at the beginning of April, Lazio region promoted a legislative initiative to allow the home delivery of subcutaneous drugs for patients not requiring any medical advice or follow-up visits. The number of patients who did not show up for scheduled visits increased, but less than expected.

The report focuses prominently on hospital organisation, personnel management and work plans. The logistic rearrangements were driven by the risk-management team, which has been the main guide for the hospital during this historic period. At the same time, we have tried to organise our work plans in accordance with current clinical necessity. At one-month follow-up, we experienced a significant increase in email and phone contacts for both physicians and administrative personnel. No infections have been registered so far among the personnel attending IBD clinic, and quarantine has not been necessary. None of the clinical personnel have been checked for active or subclinical SARS-CoV-2 infection. This issue could generate some debate, considering a relatively high prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection among health-care professionals in other clinical settings. 12 However, we can assume that our specific setting is potentially characterised by a lower prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection: COVIDdedicated paths and strict prophylactic measures promptly established by the hospital (with personal protective equipment accessible for all personnel and patients) might have helped to prevent the spread of the infection among our clinical staff. Furthermore, our work focused on IBD patients attending the centre to receive biological therapy and/ or innovative clinical trial drugs. IBD patients' reacted to the emergency situation by apparently coping positively with coronavirus, without any evident increase in request for psychological support. Patients' main concerns were about COVID-19 disease and the possible impact of biological therapies on SARS-CoV-2 infection. Most of our patients directly asked, through emails or phone calls, if they needed to stop biological therapy in order to reduce their risk for COVID-19 disease. Press and social media really stressed the concept that so-called 'immunocompromised' patients were indeed at greater risk for COVID-19 disease and complications. Our general recommendations, in accordance with the statements coming from the International Organization for the Study of Inflammatory Bowel Diseases (IOIBD), 10 were that all IBD maintenance therapies needed to continue. To date, no evidence exists regarding a drugs-related increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for IBD patients. Conversely, disease reactivation, requiring hospitalisation and intensive treatment, due to drug withdrawal is a greater concern. Furthermore, dehydration and anaemia secondary to active disease could potentially worsen a patient's outcome in the case of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

So, their cessation would not provide any immediate benefit. 14 As far as steroids are concerned, we can broadly say that our prescriptions have not affected by the outbreak of COVID-19, when strictly necessary. On the other hand, considering the warning of an increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 disease for a dose >20 mg/day of prednisone, 13 closer attention has been paid to steroid tapering in order to reduce exposure to high doses. 10 Finally, JAK inhibitors are not currently reimbursed for IBD patients in Italy.",
