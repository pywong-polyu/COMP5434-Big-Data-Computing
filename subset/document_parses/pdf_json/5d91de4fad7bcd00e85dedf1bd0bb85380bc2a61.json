The surgical mask, also known as a medical face mask, is a medical device that covers the mouth, nose, and chin and provides protection against infections transmitted by droplets. Requirements for medical masks are defined in EN (14683:2019). This decision was taken based on the data from the COVID-19 Epidemiological Surveillance System in the institution. This allowed to detect the following: (1) HAI cases in patients admitted for other pathologies, (2) infection cases on HCP due to nonprotected contacts with patients on which there was no suspicion of infection, and (3) that the main source of infection in HCP with COVID-19 was the nonprotected contacts in social interactions with other HCP or outside the working environment. This was endorsed on March 31 by the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control when they suggested that the use of surgical mask among the HCP could diminish disease transmission in healthcare environments. 6 This strategy was supported by the confirmation that SARS-CoV-2 was transmitted through respiratory droplets 20 and the growing evidence showing that asymptomatic carriers could be infectious in this phase. 21 In the context of a high level of uncertainty regarding the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE), we proposed to evaluate the global effectivity of the PC&P of COVID-19 at the AUGH and, specifically, the impact of the continuous use of a surgical mask by all HCP in the institution.",

That same day, the hospital had in stores 12,000 masks for approximately 3900 staff. Then, there was an actual shortfall of PPE, but this situation required to tightly control the distribution of equipment. At the same time, the staff was educated in the fair usage of the PPE as well as the best practice shown for low-and high-risk maneuvers (aerosol-generating procedures). Several outcomes were taken into consideration when making this decision. On one side, the potential shortfall of equipment was due to overprotection of personnel. On the other hand, there was the risk of not being able to control the source of infection represented by asymptomatic personnel working as usual who could transmit the infection. The decision was based on data from the Epidemiological Surveillance System of COVID-19 cases in the center. Then, it was evident that there was sustained SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the community and hospital environment and that more aggressive PC&P measures were required. If the use of surgical mask by all HCP had not been implemented, the reduction in incidence from March 25 (Figs. 1A, B) would not have taken place. This is due to the close environment nature of the hospital, and nonprotected contact between patients (potentially asymptomatic carriers) and HCP and among HCP (potentially asymptomatic carriers) themselves would have continued until the whole HCP and patient cohort would have been infected. This study highlights that 2 specific measures, in the context of a holistic PC&P, effectively reduce the incidence of COVID-19 cases. On one hand, the declaration of SA that limited the free movement of people in the country was effective in reducing the number of cases, in line with what previous studies have suggested. 24 On the other hand, the continuous use of a surgical mask among HCP was also effective in reducing the number of COVID-19 cases. This shed some light into the debate of their universal use in a healthcare setting; in addition, it raises the question on the potential effectivity of these measures in controlling the COVID-19 infection among the general population. However, this answer is outside of the scope of this article. Nevertheless, this underlines the importance of the rational use of mask in a time of limited resources. 25 Results also advocate for the creation in times of stability of a strategic stock of masks ready to be used during the recurring respiratory-based infectious diseases. As in these potential pandemics, this measure in conjunction of a PC&P has been proven successful. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] The results show that the implementation of a surgical mask for all HCP resulted in a reduction of affected professionals but do not necessarily imply that this would be down exclusively to this measure. We believe that it is necessary to highlight that the use of surgical masks by all HCP on its own is not enough and could be detrimental if it does not go in hand with all the PC&P measures 26 aimed to break the chain of infection (Table 1 ). In a time of constant changes, it is critical to also cater for a collective of professionals 24 and authorities 25 that constantly question the suitability of the measures taken. This behavior can lead to personnel not following the PC&P and thus increases the risk of patients and HCP. As the WHO states, it is important to observe, analyze, and inform the interested parties with data on infections relating to patient care to prevent against them. 27 In this regard, we believe that it is of utmost importance to include these strategies as part of continued medical education so that professionals are familiarized with these concepts before the initiation of the crisis. In addition, we believe that their support with the adequate resources allows for the monitorization of the potential outbreaks and ensures the implementation of rapid responses for its control.",

Specifically, healthcare institutions should widely adopt the use of surgical masks by HCP to limit COVID-19 transmission mechanism and to eliminate HCP as a source of COVID-19 infection.",
