Residual blood samples were collected for serology testing over 5-day periods monthly from June 2020 to January 2021 from six clinical laboratories across the province of Alberta, Canada. A total of 93,993 individual patient samples were tested with a SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibody assay with positives confirmed using a spike antibody assay. Population-adjusted SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity was 0.92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.91 to 0.93%) shortly after the first COVID-19 wave in June 2020, increasing to 4.63% (95% CI: 4.61 to 4.65%) amid the second wave in January 2021. There was no significant difference in seropositivity between males and females (1.39% versus 1.27%; P = 0.11). Ages with highest seropositivity were 0 to 9 years (2.71%, 95% CI: 1.64 to 3.78%) followed by 20 to 29 years (1.58%, 95% CI: 1.12 to 2.04%), with the lowest rates seen in those aged 70 to 79 (0.79%, 95% CI: 0.65 to 0.93%) and .80 (0.78%, 95% CI: 0.60 to 0.97%). Compared to the seronegative group, seropositive patients inhabited geographic areas with lower household income ($87,500 versus $97,500; P , 0.001), larger household sizes, and higher proportions of people with education levels of secondary school or lower, as well as immigrants and visible minority groups (all P , 0.05). A total of 53.7% of seropositive individuals were potentially undetected cases with no prior positive COVID-19 nucleic acid test (NAAT). Antibodies were detectable in some patients up to 9 months post positive NAAT result. This seroprevalence study will continue to inform public health decisions by identifying at-risk demographics and geographical areas.",

The first documented case of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Canada was recorded on 25 January 2020, in a passenger arriving in Toronto, Ontario indirectly from Wuhan (1) . In the Western Canadian province of Alberta, the first official case was diagnosed by post hoc testing to have occurred on 24 February 2020 in an individual arriving following travel to the Western United States (2) . Since that time, Alberta has performed over 4.2 million molecular tests for SARS-CoV-2 (as of 3 May 2021) (3) . High testing rates with rapid turnaround allow for timely contact tracing of all positive cases. This improves the effectiveness of public health interventions to identify individuals who may have been exposed to the virus and to isolate them to prevent spread within the community.",

This is inconsistent with laboratory-confirmed NAAT positives for this age group, which had NAAT positivity rates similar to those of patients 10 to 59 years of age (12% positivity in ages 0 to 9 years, 13% positivity in ages 10 to 19 years, 15% in 20 to 29, 18% in 30 to 39, 14% in 40 to 49, and 12% in 50 to 59) (3). The elevated antibody level in those .9 years of age (without a corresponding increase in NAAT positives) could indicate that many of the infections in children are either asymptomatic or mild enough not to warrant a health care visit or laboratory testing. This is also supported by our finding that seropositive children in this age group were more likely to not have had any previous NAAT testing than have a positive NAAT test. However, the low number of patients tested monthly in this age group brings high uncertainty, and results may not be representative of the general population in this age group as children who had serology samples taken may have higher risk factors for COVID-19 infection than the general population.",

Two approaches have been considered for surveillance testing, single screening assays and a two-step approach where positive screening assays are confirmed with a second assay (generally targeting a different antibody epitope). While orthogonal serology testing was initially recommended to increase the confidence in positive antibody results, and is currently used in most public health laboratories in Canada, its role in surveillance studies is now being questioned (12, 13) . In cases where it is essential to ensure a sample is positive for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies, such as plasma enrichment, an orthogonal algorithm is still indicated; however, in cases where false positives are less of a concern and, as in the case for serosurveillance studies, false negatives should be minimized, orthogonal testing may not be the best approach. This is supported by our data where only 66.7% of samples that were positive by the architect nucleocapsid antibody (cutoff $1.4) were confirmed positive by the DiaSorin spike antibody assay. When we examined positivity rates for January, there was a significant difference between single assay and two-step (orthogonal) testing (4.63% positivity compared to 7.24% adjusted positivity, respectively) (Fig. S2) . Similar to what we have observed, other groups have found that population screening using a lower cutoff value describes more accurately the NAAT positivity rate seen in the province (7) . Likewise, we see a higher positivity rate of 4.2% if we use single assay detection at a cutoff of $0.7 for the month of December, which is more consistent with the approximately 5% NAAT positivity rate seen 2 to 3 weeks prior to serum collection (assuming antibodies are not detected until 2 to 3 weeks post NAAT-positive result) (14) . As the prevalence, and likewise the positive predictive value, of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection increases in our population, the need for orthogonal testing will likely continue to decrease.",

Using the orthogonal algorithm, we found that 0.7% of patients negative by NAAT were subsequently positive by IgG (Table S5) . Some cross-reactivity to other respiratory viruses has been observed with commercial SARS-CoV-2 serology assays (14) , which may explain, in part, the discordance between NAAT and antibody testing (particularly as many respiratory viruses have overlapping clinical symptom presentations). From our experience, we have observed the DiaSorin SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay display a false positive for someone who was SARS-CoV-2 negative and recovered from parainfluenza virus (14) . From that study, while we did not observe any cross-reactivity of the Abbott Architect with a panel of well-characterized prepandemic sera, other IgG assays evaluated demonstrated crossreactivity with human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus/enterovirus, and coronavirus 229E. This may contribute to the higher positivity potentially seen in children, but to what extent is not certain. However, a positive serology with a negative NAAT does not necessarily mean the serology was a false positive, as timing and quality of NAAT collection may contribute to a negative result (15) . Additionally, previous studies examining SARS-CoV-2 and Middle East respiratory virus (MERS-CoV) NAAT detection showed false-positive rates ranging from 2% to 30% (average 8%) (16, 17) . Overall, the discordance between the two methods is very low and within the range of the manufacturer's published performance criteria.",

In our study, we detected nucleocapsid and spike antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 up to 36 weeks (8 months) post NAAT positive. While the numbers were small, we did not detect antibodies to nucleocapsid in samples collected at 37 or 38 weeks post NAAT-positive result. Only a very small proportion of individuals did not mount an antibody response following a positive PCR result (0.59%), suggesting that most individuals will mount a humoral response following natural infection. One limitation to this study is that a nucleocapsid antibody assay was used as the first screening test, and therefore antibody to spike is assessed only in samples positive for nucleocapsid antibody.",

Additionally, there is a sampling bias for large urban centers, as access to care in these centers has more entry points than that in more rural regions. While we attempted to mitigate this disparity by increasing the collection time for samples from more rural sites, this bias cannot be totally ignored. Additionally, we have used census data as a proxy for individual data, which may have led to misclassification of these sociodemographic variables for individual patients, and it is also possible that the sociodemographic data shifted for regions between the time of the 2016 census to our analysis in 2020.

These variables included median household income, average household size, marital status by proportions of married/common-law or single Albertans, proportions of highest education level achieved (below high school, high school, diploma/certificate, Bachelor's degree, or graduate/professional degree), proportions by immigration status (immigrant, recent immigrant within the past 5 years, or nonpermanent resident), visible minority status (31), and group proportions (self-identify as Aboriginal or of African, Chinese, non-Chinese East Asian, South Asian, Latin American, or Middle Eastern descent).
