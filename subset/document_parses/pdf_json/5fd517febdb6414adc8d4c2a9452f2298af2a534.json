            "text": "In the Netherlands, the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus, was diagnosed on February 27, 2020. By the end of October 2020, more than 350,000 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections had been reported. 1 To prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 virus, the Dutch government introduced a series of restrictions starting between March 12 and 15, 2020, such as cancelling large events, closing public facilities, restricting international travel, urging everyone to work from home, and minimizing physical contact (defined as less than 1.5-m distance) with nonhousehold members. 2, 3 These restrictions also included closure of meeting venues alongside the specific recommendation of not to have sex with partners outside the household. 4 This could have hypothetically led to decreases in sexual activity with casual partners and increases in sexual activity with steady partners. Consequently, the need for condoms and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV and transmission of sexually transmitted infections (STI) including HIV could have decreased in parallel. By contrast, decreasing HIV/STI testing and less PrEP use could have also led to increased HIV/STI transmission. From May 11, 2020, onward, the Dutch government started to lift restrictions, albeit the recommendation of physical distancing was not lifted. 5 In the Netherlands, PrEP is indicated for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender people (TGP) who, in the previous 6 months, had condomless anal sex (CAS) with a male partner with unknown HIV status or detectable HIV viral load, were diagnosed with an anal STI or syphilis, and/or used postexposure prophylaxis. 6 PrEP is predominantly provided through STI clinics as part of a national program that started in August 2019, offering PrEP at a reduced price; it can also be obtained at a higher price through general practitioners. When COVID-19 restrictions were first put in place, the outpatient STI clinic in Amsterdam scaled down PrEP care and suspended routine HIV/STI testing from March 23. PrEP was provided only to those already using PrEP and who had a continued need for it. HIV/STI care was restricted to only those with STI-related symptoms, who were warned by a partner, or victims of a sex offence, and sexual health counseling during these consultations was minimized. From the beginning of May 2020, restrictions were gradually eased, and PrEP users in the National PrEP program were contacted again for follow-up appointments.",

If they indicated anal sex, follow-up questions were prompted about the type of sexual partners and whether a condom was used during sex on that day. We differentiated the partners as steady partners (SPs), known casual partners (KCPs), and unknown casual partners (UCPs). A SP was a sex partner with whom the participant was partnered in a steady relationship (independent of length of time). A KCP was a sex partner who was known to the participant but not a steady partner. A UCP was a sex partner who was unknown to the participant. Participants could indicate multiple sex acts and multiple partner types per day. An update of the app was released in November 2019. Since then, participants could also indicate the number of different sex partners per partner type on a given day and whether they had used a condom during each individual sex act.",

Once the most restrictive recommendations were relaxed from May 11, 2020, 5 sexual behavior seemed to return to prelockdown levels for each partner type, although the recommendation of physical distancing was not lifted. This rebound in sexual behavior after COVID-19 restrictions were lifted has received little attention in previous studies. Some authors suggest that reductions in casual sex may have reduced HIV and STI transmission, and preliminary evidence would suggest this to be the case. 17, 18 However, if changes in casual sex are only short-term, their impact on STI incidence will be limited. It is indeed possible that because restrictions were implemented and much was unknown regarding severity and transmission of COVID-19, the perceived threat and severity of SARS-CoV-2 infection increased and led to the sudden change in behavior. 19, 20 The effect of these changes in sexual behavior on HIV and STI incidence should be further evaluated. Because, at our clinic, the need for STI screening during restrictions was mostly prioritized on the presence of STIrelated symptoms, partner notification, or sex offence, asymptomatic STIs would no longer be detected, which would increase the probability of ongoing transmission. Understanding how to optimize STI screening during periods of social restrictions is, therefore, warranted.",

The overall decrease in PrEP use after the implementation of restrictions was likely because of the decrease in sex acts with casual partners. Similarly, in previous analyses of AMPrEP, switching to a lower-frequency PrEP regimen and discontinuation of PrEP were found to be partly driven by less frequent sexual contact or fewer partners. 21 PrEP use during sex with casual partners did not differ greatly before and after the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions, although a slight reduction was found for sex with UCPs. It is reassuring that PrEP was used during most of the sex acts with casual partners in a period when STI clinics were not as easily accessible for HIV testing and PrEP care.",

Although the downward trend in condom use could be an artifact of general declines in condom use among PrEP users, 22, 23 alternative explanations might also be relevant. Because participants limited the number of KCPs and UCPs during COVID-19 restrictions, perceived risk of HIV/STI may have been reduced in parallel, resulting in a reduction in condom use. Participants might have also expected less frequent sexual encounters with UCPs during COVID-19 restrictions and consequently stopped PrEP or did not have PrEP readily available. This could result in no HIV/STI prevention strategies being used when sex with a UCPs occurs spontaneously, particularly for men whose use of condoms was already low.",

Reasons for not taking PrEP during restrictions, particularly with casual sex partners, need to be established to provide input for ongoing PrEP and STI services during restrictions. A study from Brazil reported that lack of PrEP accessibility was the predominant reason for PrEP discontinuation during their SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. 9 If it is also the case in the Netherlands, sexual health clinics should look for alternative ways to provide PrEP, such as online services, or share PrEP care and services evenly with general practitioners who remained accessible for consultations during COVID-19 restrictions.",

In addition, we were able to rule out any time-based effect aside from COVID-19 restrictions by comparing changes during the same dates 1 year before. Daily collected data from an app is, furthermore, less likely to be influenced by recall and social desirability bias compared with retrospective surveys. 24 However, the use of daily app data also has some limitations. First, the distribution of some characteristics known to influence sexual behavior, such as age and living situation, did differ between app users and nonapp users. Second, not all participants answered the questions in the app every day; app use decreased over time, and some participants stopped using the app during COVID-19 altogether. We did not account for these missing data because they were likely not at random but rather associated with absence of sex and PrEP use. Accounting for missing data would have likely further enlarged the difference between periods before versus after restrictions. However, the effect may be limited because we found similar patterns in sensitivity analyses among participants who filled in the app $90% of days within each month, and demographic characteristics and sexual behavior were largely similar for participants who did and did not use the app after the implementation of COVID-19 restrictions. Third, we did not have data on sexual positioning during sex and whether condoms were used the entire sex act and can, therefore, not make inferences about HIV risk during individual CAS acts. Fourth, the AMPrEP study population is a selective group of older, highly educated, white, early PrEP adopters who had been taking PrEP for roughly 4 years before the COVID-19 epidemic, and results may not be generalizable to all MSM taking PrEP. Specifically, this cohort of experienced PrEP users has been extensively counseled in safely starting and stopping PrEP and might, therefore, be more equipped to estimate their HIV risk and change their PrEP use accordingly 21,25 compared with recentinitiation PrEP users. Therefore, the results of this study should be confirmed in other groups of PrEP users. Fifth, in this analysis, no data were available on TGP. Finally, because the outcomes assessed with the multilevel logistic regression models occurred frequently, the odds ratios obtained from these models cannot be interpreted as risk ratios.",

The decrease in sex with casual partners was paralleled with a decrease in PrEP use. However, condom use during sex with casual partners decreased. Continued sex with casual partners, although reduced, and the decrease in condom use with these partners indicate the importance of continued sexual health services, including STI screening and PrEP care, during COVID-19 restrictions. Putting infrastructure into place to make these services available, while safeguarding the potential risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection for patients and clinical staff (eg, online consultations or home-based testing), is of importance not only during the current pandemic but also for potential future pandemics.
