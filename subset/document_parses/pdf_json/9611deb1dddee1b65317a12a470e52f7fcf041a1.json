Similarly, in 2015, an Irish survey identified the number, and duration of shortages in a community setting. This study explored that 65/1232 (5.3%) of dispensed drugs were unavailable and had a shortage duration of 13 days on average [5] . The Pharmaceutical Group of the European Union survey (PGEU) examined medicine shortages at EU level as reducing patient confidence (92%), employee satisfaction (79%) and increasing financial losses (82%) [6] .",

When several community pharmacists gave the same answer to a particular question, this was seen as a significant finding. Two researchers (SO and SA) then aggregated the final inductive codes into the significant categories. Themes and sub-themes were developed by grouping together several categories to conceptualize the data. Qualitative data managing software (NVivo version 12 Plus, Australia) was used for analysis.

A recent study by Atif et al. (2019) also found that poor prescribing was one of the barriers to the successful management of shortages in Pakistan [11] . Another gap in prescribing habits was that physicians recommended short medications to patients due to lack of awareness of market status of short supplies.",

However, pharmacists should be cautious when offering alternative medicine, because it can harm patients by adverse events and medication errors. In 2012, an Associated Press research reported 15 fatalities over a 15-month period due to the complexity of managing medicine shortages [32] . Community pharmacists further elaborated that their efforts to manage shortages are not enough, unless potential barriers are eliminated. Irrational use of medication due to self-medication and drug abuse has exacerbated the shortage problem. Appropriate control over the use of drugs and strict penalties on the illegitimate sale of a prescription-only drug could possibly decrease the level of medicine shortages uplifted by excessive demand. In Pakistan the laws are often developed, but not applied properly. For instance, The Pakistan Drug Law 1976 outlines the manufacturing, distribution and sale of the medicine, but due to its weak enforcement, medicine shortages cannot be managed properly.",
