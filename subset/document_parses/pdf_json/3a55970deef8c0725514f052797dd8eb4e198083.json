The aim of this article is to present optic neuritis, as possible post-infectious manifestation of COVID-19. Four weeks after hospitalization for seropositive coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19), presented as bilateral bronchopneumonia, with radiology and laboratory findings also pointed to high clinical suspicion to COVID-19, a 63-year-old man developed a headache and subacute and profound visual loss on his right eye. The disease presentation was the right eye papillitis. Inflammatory parameters were normal at the time of hospitalization, and IgM and IgG for SARS-CoV-2 were still positive. After corticosteroid pulse therapy, his vision improved significantly and on follow-up visits returned to normal. All laboratory and radiology findings were unremarkable, except for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 and myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG). We discuss about capacity of SARS-CoV-2 to cause optic neuritis and possible significance of MOG antibodies in similar cases.",

This was particularly the case for the nervous system. 1 In contrast, there have been only a handful of clinically significant ophthalmological and neuro-ophthalmological cases. 2 The nervous system can be affected by SARS-CoV-2 via several mechanisms: directly, by neurotoxic action, when the virus reaches the nervous system by different routes and binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors, cytokine storm with blood-brain barrier disruption and immunological mediation, and by increased blood coagulation and blood clot formations. 3 Optic neuritis is inflammation of the optic nerve, and it has varied causes. 4 The usual manifestations are papillitis-anterior neuritis, with visible optic nerve head edema and retrobulbar neuritis, in which signs of inflammation are not visible on the ocular fundus.",

            "text": "The exact role of MOG is unclear. It is thought to act as a cellular adhesive molecule, involved in regulating oligodendrocyte microtubule stability and to mediation of the complement cascade. 10 MOG antibodies are associated with MOG-AD, a rare and specific group of demyelinating diseases. 11, 12 The clinical course can be monophasic or relapsing and usually has milder and more favorable clinical course than other demyelinating diseases. Optic neuritis may be the only manifestation. However, it most frequently manifests as AQP4-seronegative neuromyelitis optica, in adults in their 40s or in combination with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), in children, or brainstem encephalitis. 11, 12 Although MOG-AD can occurs without any apparent inciting or predisposing cause, it has been found associated with post-infectious demyelination following infections with herpes simplex virus, Borrelia and Epstein-Barr virus. [13] [14] [15] [16] The prevailing mechanism of injury is felt to involve molecular mimicry, where a variety of potential viral antigens trigger an immune response directed toward endogenous CNS myelin proteins, including MOG. 17 MOG antibodies can be found in serum. However, they do not cause nervous system disease until they cross the brain-blood barrier, usually due to inflammation or infection associated with elevated serum antibodies. 18 Antibody synthesis occurs mostly extrathecally and cerebrospinal fluid testing is not usually required. MOG antibody titers are higher in relapse than in remission. In monophasic disease, decreasing titers are usually found. 12, 19 In experimental animals MOG antibodies are proven neuro-pathogenic factors, and disease can be provoked by coronaviruses. [20] [21] [22] [23] Our patient is not the only one who demonstrated a connection between SARS-CoV-2 and MOG antibodies in the context of optic neuritis. [5] [6] [7] [8] Reports are scarce, which is understandable in the pandemic situation. Nevertheless, they are sufficient to be informative. Only one case was described following viral infection. 7 Given the affinity of the virus to nervous tissues and cytokine storms during disease progression, the number of postinfectious cases should be higher.",

Usually recommended method for MOG antibodies titer is the cell-based assay. 24 The patients in three previously mentioned cases had MOG antibodies. [6] [7] [8] Not all authors reported the testing methods or titer levels. Only Sawalha et al reported serum titers in a man with bilateral optic neuritis, 7 and Zhou et al in a man with optic neuritis and myelitis. 6 The second limitation is that the PCR of the patient's nasopharyngeal swab was negative for SARS-CoV-2 negative three times, but antibodies, while IgM and IgG were positive. The presence of antibodies rises rapidly by the day 15 of onset of the disease, while RNA detectability declines between 15 and 39 days. 25 Despite exceptions that prove the rule, the most frequent sequence of virus-specific antibody conversion begins with an early IgM response, followed by a later emergence of IgG. These antibodies can appear synchronously and IgM can even appears after IgG. 26 The levels of IgG antibodies in our patient are high enough, several months after his first hospitalization, but it is similar for igM antibodies. Regarding PCR testing, bronchoalveolar lavage sample testing can be positive in cases with nasopharyngeal swab negative results. 25, 27 The consensus opinion is that diagnostic serology is of limited value, and PCR is preferred. Nevertheless, serology tests can be used for specific purposes such as for hospitalized patients with a suggestive clinical pictures and when there is a divergence between PCR and computed tomography findings. 28 Our patient had bilateral bronchopneumonia, with laboratory results highly suspicious for COVID-19. It is, also, crucial to note that our patient was seropositive only for SARS-CoV-2, and not for other pathogens or diseases. Nevertheless, the viral antibodies titers were not monitored when his first hospitalization, and exact values of SARS-CoV -2 antibodies were only obtained at his final follow-up visit.",

Values for the left eye (OS) are normal. (B) Four months after optic neuritis-the right eye optic disc edema is withdrawn and some atrophic changes appeared, most prominently in superior quadrant and as average thinning of RNFL (marked in yellow) and focal loss volume (FLV%) (marked in red) on the right eye (OD), compared to the left eye (OS) normal values.
