However, many countries have made progress toward malaria elimination, including Malaysia. Malaysia has shown great success in moving closer to its goal of eliminating indigenous human malaria transmission, evidenced by the number of locally acquired human malaria cases plummeting to zero in 2018 [3] . However, the ongoing increase in zoonotic Plasmodium knowlesi cases poses a major challenge to malaria control and might cause Malaysia to miss its goal to be a malaria-free country. Currently, knowlesi malaria is the predominant malaria infection in Malaysia [3, 4] . Although a significant proportion of the knowlesi malaria cases in Malaysia were previously confined to Malaysian Borneo, the increase in the number of cases in Peninsular Malaysia for the past few years from 113 cases in 2015 to 598 cases in 2018 is alarming [5] .",

Thus, it is essential to identify reliable adult mosquito sampling techniques which can characterize mosquito biting density on humans. Even though there are various methods for adult mosquito sampling, human landing catch (HLC) remains the \"gold standard\" [12] . HLC is the most reliable method to represent the human biting rate, but it is labor intensive and very risky especially when the collectors were exposed to infective mosquito bites while performing the catches. HLC exposes the participants to an array of vector-borne diseases such as chikungunya, dengue, malaria, filariasis and viral encephalitis, for many of which there is no prophylaxis or only limited treatment options [13] . The emergence of drug-resistant Plasmodium falciparum further exacerbates the health and ethical issues related to HLC in malaria endemic countries like in Southeast Asia. Besides mosquitoes, the participants in HLC are also exposed to other blood-feeding arthropods such as ticks which could cause Lyme disease [14] . Besides being very laborious, the mosquitoes collected through HLC are also influenced by the skills of the collectors and body odors which might affect the type and quantity of mosquitoes caught [15] .",

This includes the possibilities of encountering dangerous wild animals when sampling in deep forested area for long hours. Thus, lack of data on the spatiotemporal distribution of mosquito species in certain areas can impede the process of understanding the zoonotic transmission dynamics of simian malaria. Although there are other trapping methods that use physical and chemical attractants for vector surveillance (without using humans as bait), each method has its own limitations. In general, all trapping methods and attractants have variable performances compared to HLC for Anopheles mosquitoes sampling [17] . Considering that the current conventional approaches are challenged by many factors, an alternative trapping method is urgently needed for the surveillance of simian malaria vectors.",

Mosquito Magnet was originally designed to catch and kill mosquitoes by dehydrating them in the net by trapping them for many days. However, when the mosquitoes are collected within the same day, live mosquitoes can be obtained, which can be dissected for further entomological investigation. Several studies have evaluated the efficiency of Mosquito Magnet in trapping mosquitoes [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . However, all those studies were conducted in countries outside Southeast Asia where different species of Anopheles mosquitoes were caught. Mosquito Magnet was found to be effective in catching Neo-tropical Anopheles species, i.e. An. nuneztovari and An. darlingi, which significantly correlates with the results of HLC, but is not efficient in collecting An. marajoara [23] . These findings call for further investigations to assess the effectiveness of Mosquito Magnet for surveillance of Anopheles populations in Malaysia. Furthermore, the efficacy of the Mosquito Magnet in trapping Keywords: Anopheles, Mosquito Magnet, Plasmodium knowlesi, Simian malaria, Trapping methods, Vector surveillance, Zoonosis Anopheles mosquitoes from the Leucosphyrus group, which are the known vectors for knowlesi and simian malaria, has not been determined while other methods such as CDC light traps [24] and human baited traps [25] have been previously evaluated.",

Besides, to evaluate the association between these two trapping methods, Bland-Altman analysis was used [36] . Bland-Altman analysis provides a graphical approach to illustrate the agreement between two quantitative measurements by constructing limits of agreement, which were calculated using the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the differences between two measurements [37] . In addition, a chi-square test of independence was employed to analyze the difference between the proportion of Anopheles mosquitoes caught using HLC and Mosquito Magnet for each sampling location. The level of statistical significance was set at P < 0.05 for all tests.",

This shows that there was a certain level of agreement between these two trapping methods. A Bland-Altman plot was constructed to showcase the consistency between the number of Anopheles from the Leucosphyrus group caught in HLC and Mosquito Magnet (Fig. 5) . The plot shows that all the data fall within the limits of agreement set at \u00b1 1.96 SD of the mean difference (Fig. 5, dashed lines) . At lower population density (< 5 mean catches of Anopheles per night), the difference between catches using HLC and Mosquito Magnet was smaller, but increased as the density increased. This density-dependent correlation indicates that at a higher mosquito density, HLC was able to capture a greater number of Anopheles mosquitoes compared to Mosquito Magnet. The mean difference also indicated that HLC was able to catch three to four Anopheles mosquitoes more compared to Mosquito Magnet each night. The line of equality at 0 showed the perfect agreement between the two methods where there was no difference in the catch by both methods. However, since the line of equality 0 falls slightly outside the observed mean, there were differences in the catch between the two methods, where the Anopheles catch was slightly biased toward HLC.",

These include the conventional trapping methods such as CDC light traps [24] , human-baited double net (HDN) traps [25] , BG-malaria traps [38, 39] and monkey-baited traps [40] as well as some of the latest methods, including M-Tego [41] , Suna traps [42] and electric nets [43] . All these studies agree that different sampling techniques influence the quantity and diversity of the mosquitoes collected. Thus, with the emergence of knowlesi malaria in many countries in Southeast Asia, there is a need for more robust and effective trapping methods which are able to capture the local Anopheles mosquitoes particularly from the Leucosphyrus group, which are the vectors for knowlesi malaria [16] and other zoonotic simian Plasmodium. This study to our knowledge represents the first description and comparison of Mosquito Magnet to some of the commonly used mosquito trapping methods to sample Anopheles mosquito for malaria studies in Malaysia. Generally, HLC performed best at catching mosquitoes from both the Anophelinae and Culicinae subfamilies. However, HLC has its limitations. Some of the limitations of using HLC include probable variation in the attractiveness of human hosts to mosquitoes due to different body odor [15] and ethical considerations regarding accidental infection with malaria. Detection of simian Plasmodium in the salivary glands of some mosquitoes collected in this study highlights the inherent risk of exposure to infectious bites during the collection period using HLC. In addition, there is the probability of interpersonal variation of skills among the collectors, which can indirectly lead to biasness in the collection. On the other hand, Mosquito Magnet, which does not use humans as the natural bait, can be an alternative strategy that allows standardized sampling conditions for the surveillance of exophagic simian malaria vectors.",

            "text": "Contrarily, CO 2 baited CDC light traps performed very poorly compared to the other three methods. In this study, the CDC light trap caught the fewest of all three Anopheles species (An. sinensis, An. introlatus and An. maculatus) obtained from the study sites. A similar study conducted many years ago in a malarious area with high numbers of An. maculatus also failed to collect Anopheles spp. using CDC light traps [44] . Our findings were also in agreement with the previous study by Rohani et al. (2016) where HLC had a better ability to catch these three species of Anopheles mosquitoes compared to CO 2 baited CDC light traps [24] . However, in their study, An. cracens was reported to be more attracted to CDC light traps. Unfortunately, we did not test the CDC light trap in Kem Sri Gading where An. cracens were obtained in our study. Both studies had utilized dry ice as the source of CO 2 . Indeed, dry ice has been proven to be more effective in releasing CO 2 , and the efficacy in attracting mosquitoes was significantly higher compared to CO 2 generated by yeast [45] . However, this is a problem when vector surveillance is conducted in remote areas with no access to dry ice. Nevertheless, this problem can be overcome by the combustion of propane to produce CO 2 in the Mosquito Magnet. The Mosquito Magnet converts the propane from the gas tank to warm carbon dioxide and moisture through a patented catalytic converter process for the endless release of CO 2 [22, 26, 27] . The CO 2 and heat released mimic a human or animal host, which acts as an attractant. Another alternative method commonly used is the HBT. Previous study in Lao PDR showed that HBT had a similar ability to catch Anopheles mosquitoes as HLC but was significantly more efficient than CDC light traps [25] . This was expected since both HLC and HBT use humans as the bait. However, in our studies, HLC caught significantly more Anopheles mosquitoes than both the CDC light trap and HBT. These variations are probably due to the differences in the species of Anopheles mosquitoes caught in the two studies. Although HBT is an ethically acceptable alternative to HLC as it prevents the collectors from being exposed to mosquitoes and other hematophagous insect bites, it still has an underlying danger of exposing the collectors to dangerous wild animals, a similar risk as with the HLC method. This occurs especially when mosquito collections are carried out in forested areas for long periods of time particularly targeting the vectors of simian malaria. There is also concern that HBT might underestimate the true mosquito abundance as mosquitoes would escape through the gap of the outer net when they cannot feed [46] . However, in our study this probability was reduced by collecting the mosquitoes hourly. Another challenge faced with HBT is the difficulty in finding a suitable place to set up the traps in hilly terrains and deep jungles where there is limited flat ground or cleared space. Areas with dense shrubs and bushes can obstruct the mosquitoes from entering the net through the limited gap in HBTs, which is only few centimeters from the ground. The need for a large clear space to set up the HBT posed another challenge to using this method in forested areas. On the other hand, the Mosquito Magnet requires a very small space to set up, and the usage of portable batteries makes it very easy to station the Mosquito Magnet in any area inside the forest and carry out collections after a certain amount of time.",

Focusing on the vectors of knowlesi and simian malaria, a further study was carried out to compare the efficiency of Mosquito Magnet in catching Anopheles from the Leucosphyrus group of mosquitoes against the \"gold standard\" HLC. Both the CDC light trap and human baited trap were not further evaluated in Kem Sri Gading because the Latin square designed experiments showed no significant difference in the mean nightly catch of Anopheles mosquitoes between the Mosquito Magnet and the other two trapping methods. Of the five Anopheles species collected in this study, An. cracens [40] and An. introlatus [47] are known vectors of knowlesi malaria while An. maculatus [28] and An. sinensis [48] are known vectors of human malaria. However, to date, An. sinensis has not been incriminated as a vector for human malaria in Malaysia. Although Mosquito Magnet did not catch more mosquitoes compared to HLC, the differences were not statistically significant especially for An. introlatus and An. cracens. Thus, this showed the Mosquito Magnet has a promising ability to catch An. introlatus and An. cracens compared to An. sinensis and An. maculatus. On the other hand, no statistical analysis was employed for An. barbirostris gp since the number was very low. Statistically, there was a certain level of agreement between HLC and Mosquito Magnet from this study. Thus, Mosquito Magnet has the potential to be used as an alternative tool for vector surveillance for outdoor host-seeking malaria vectors. This is especially for vectors of knowlesi malaria, which were predominantly exophagous and found in relatively high biting rates in farm edges bordering forests and forested areas [49, 50] .",

In this study, Lurex 3 attractant was utilized. Other available attractants are Octenol and CO 2 sachet [51] . A study comparing these different types of attractant revealed that Octenol was more effective in catching mosquitoes compared to the other two attractants [19] . However, that study was conducted in north-central Florida where different species of Anopheles were captured: An. crucians and An. quadrimaculatus. In a separate laboratory experimental study, Lurex 3 was found to be effective in attracting An. gambiae (s.s.) [21] . Indeed, different types of attractants or body odor play important roles in catching the different species of host-seeking mosquitoes [17] . This was also shown in our study where the Lurex 3 attractant used in the Mosquito Magnet might have been a better attractant for An. cracens and An. introlatus compared to An. maculatus and An. sinensis. This highlights the importance of testing the Mosquito Magnet with different attractants on the local Anopheles vectors before deploying them. Perhaps, it would be worthwhile to try the Octenol attractant in the future to compare the results with Lurex 3 for vectors of knowlesi malaria in the Southeast Asia setting.",

Unfortunately, no P. knowlesi was detected in any of the mosquitoes collected from the four study locations. This might be due to the study locations situated outside the hotspot spatial clusters of knowlesi malaria in Peninsular Malaysia [5] . Besides, both Kem Microwave Bukit Tinggi and Kem Sri Gading Jengka where positive mosquitoes were obtained had only reported sporadic knowlesi malaria cases from 2011 until 2019. The exact locations where the infections might have occurred were uncertain. From the history taking, most likely the infection had occurred while the person traveled deep into the jungle, which was not an ideal location to conduct the Latin square designed experiment because of the risk involved, logistic demands and also the need for clear flat ground to erect the HBT. The high number of P. inui detected in the mosquitoes from this study agrees with many other studies conducted in Southeast Asia where P. inui and P. cynomolgi were more prevalent compared to P. knowlesi in both macaques and mosquitoes [52] .",

            "text": "There are also some limitations to using Mosquito Magnet for vector surveillance. In this study, the Mosquito Magnet was operated continuously for 6 h. Thus, we were unable to study the biting time of the mosquitoes unlike HLC. However, this limitation can be easily overcome when the net is replaced hourly, depending on the objective of the study. Indeed, it will provide valuable data such as peak biting time that would be comparable to HLC. In addition, Mosquito Magnet might have a limitation in measuring the host preferences of the vectors. The ammonia and lactic acid in the Lurex 3 attractant used in the Mosquito Magnet act as kairomones to attract anthropophilic Anopheles mosquitoes [53, 54] . Thus, it might be a limitation for studies on the vectors which are more attracted to other hosts such as macaques. However, interestingly, the Mosquito Magnet was able to collect more vectors of simian malaria compared to vectors of human malaria. Since macaques are the natural host for P. knowlesi, few studies evaluated the efficiency of monkey-baited traps to catch Anopheles mosquitoes, especially the vectors of simian malaria. However, those studies showed monkey-baited traps [40] and macaque odor-baited electrocuting nets [43] performed less effectively compared to HLC in trapping the mosquitoes. Perhaps with human populations increasingly encroaching on the macaque habitat, there might be selective pressure for these simian malaria vectors to change their blood meal preference. The usage of macaques for catching mosquitoes for entomological surveillance also poses other challenges such as ethical issues and risk of transmission of Herpesvirus simiae and other types of pathogens which are usually present in non-human primates [55] . Besides, usage of monkeybaited traps requires trained personnel to handle the macaques. However, with some minor improvement, a host preference study can be carried out using the Mosquito Magnet. The attractant used in the Mosquito Magnet can be replaced with a small piece of cloth which has been rubbed on the macaques or any other host odor [56] . This will enable host preference studies to be carried out. In addition, caged animals which are potential hosts can also be used together with the Mosquito Magnet in an improvised host decoy trap (HDT) to study host preferences [57] .",

However, the comparable ability of Mosquito Magnet to catch some of the Anopheles species makes it an ethical and safer alternative. Mosquito Magnet, which is less labor intensive, can be effectively used to study the vectors of zoonotic simian malaria especially An. cracens and An. introlatus, which are the vectors of knowlesi malaria in Peninsular Malaysia. Further studies are nevertheless needed to confirm the catching efficiency of Mosquito Magnet on other Anopheles species from the Leucosphyrus group. Ideally, the choice of alternate method for the capture of the zoonotic simian malaria vectors must consider the host preference of the vectors and the ability of the method to represent the results of human attraction shown through HLC. However, the cost of the Mosquito Magnet could be a prohibiting factor, but studies should be conducted to show that regular use of Mosquito Magnet can help to reduce vector density. If this can be proven at least there is a tool available for the surveillance and control of P. knowlesi vectors.",
