Flow cytometry assay, immunofluorescence assay, and Western blot analysis were performed to detect macrophage polarization in vitro. The ALI model was induced by LPS via intratracheal instillation, and XPS (20, 40, and 80 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically 2 h later.

The LPSstimulated macrophage polarization was also modulated from M1 to M2. In vivo, XPS maintained pulmonary histology with significantly reducing protein concentration and numbers of mononuclear cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF). The level of IL-10 in BALF was upregulated by XPS treatment. The level of cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-6 was downregulated. XPS also decreased infiltration of macrophages and polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs) in lung. XPS suppressed the expression of key proteins in the TLR4/NF-\u03baB signal pathway.",

An increased M1 macrophage ratio, recruitment of neutrophils, and secretion of a large number of cytokines were observed in the acute inflammatory phase of ALI . M1 macrophages are found to exacerbate pathological inflammation, while M2 macrophages reduce autophagy and accelerate tissue repair (Su et al.) .
