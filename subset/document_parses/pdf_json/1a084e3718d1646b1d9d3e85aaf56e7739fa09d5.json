The consequences of misinformation dissemination include psychosocial, economic, health status, health system and ethical ones. The most recommended strategies for dealing with the issue could be divided into demand and supply-side strategies.",

The basic sciences and clinical faculty members with the ranks of assistant, associate and full professor have joined these groups with different specialties. Most of them have PhD or clinical specialty. These groups are unofficial and all the faculties are free to join. All the group members were able to share a piece of information in the audio, video, or textual format. Also, the space of discussion about the contents of the shared information was available. The researchers as the members of these groups, only read and record all the contents and the discussions about them in an electronic form. In the course of data collection, researchers didn't participate in discussions to be able to analyze the discourses and to avoid any bias. The present proposal was developed merely for this study.

The research question was defined as \"how and why the misinformation about COVID-19 disseminates via social online platforms and what are the negative consequences and best coping strategies\". Then, the content was selected for analysis. In this regard, 5 WhatsApp and Telegram groups containing medical faculty members all over the country were chosen and all the related content about COVID-19 was selected. II. Gathering information and theory on the context.A rapid search on the databases of PubMed, Medline and Google scholar was conducted because of their free access in Iran applying these keywords: \"misinformation\", \"disinformation\", \"false information\", \"wrong information\", \"fake news\" \"cause\", \"incentive\", \"stimulus\", \"reason\", \"typology\" and \"coping strategies\" with the combination by \"COVID-19\" or \"coronavirus\". Also, the governmental health guidelines and framework were retrieved to achieve the best related framework to the research question. Finally, a framework consisting of causes and incentives for disseminating misinformation, the process, outcomes, and strategies were chosen for deductive data analysis based on the concept of information management flow [18] . III. Content analysis for establishing the themes and patterns.A deductive framework analysis approach was applied to analyze the contents. This approach provides clear steps to follow and produces highly structured outputs of summarized data. Framework analysis was recommended for multidisciplinary health researches with managing large data sets where obtaining a holistic, descriptive overview of the entire data set is desirable including 4 stages as follows: transcription, familiarization, coding and developing a working analytical framework [19, 20] . In this regard the whole data was reviewed and the related codes which were best suited with the elements of the selected framework were extracted deductively. IV.

As reported by Lee et al. [11] and Murphy [24] our findings showed that the social media was the main tools of transferring misinformation. The major topics/ typology of the misinformation include: disease statistics, treatments, prevention and protection methods, dietary recommendations and methods of transferring the virus. Murphy has identified three common types of misinformation relating to COVID-19: false claims, conspiracy theories and pseudoscientific health therapies [24] . It seems that at the time of epidemic, the people want to know about the probability and severity of the illness very quickly and also they have a strong tendency to find the preventive and curative solutions [25] .",
