            "text": "We report the neuropathological findings of a patient who died from complications of COVID-19. The decedent was initially hospitalized for surgical management of underlying coronary artery disease. He developed post-operative complications and was evaluated with chest imaging studies. The chest computed tomography (CT) imaging results were indicative of COVID-19 and he was subsequently tested for SARS-CoV-2, which was positive. His condition worsened and he died after more than 2 weeks of hospitalization and aggressive treatment. The autopsy revealed a range of neuropathological lesions, with features resembling both vascular and demyelinating etiologies. Hemorrhagic white matter lesions were present throughout the cerebral hemispheres with surrounding axonal injury and macrophages. The subcortical white matter had scattered clusters of macrophages, a range of associated axonal injury, and a perivascular acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like appearance. Additional white matter lesions included focal microscopic areas of necrosis with central loss of white matter and marked axonal injury. Rare neocortical organizing microscopic infarcts were also identified. Imaging and clinical reports have demonstrated central nervous system complications in patients' with COVID-19, but there is a gap in our understanding of the neuropathology. The lesions described in this case provide insight into the potential parainfectious processes affecting COVID-19 patients, which may direct clinical management and ongoing research into the disease. The clinical course of the patient also illustrates that during prolonged hospitalizations neurological complications of COVID may develop, which are particularly difficult to evaluate and appreciate in the critically ill.",

            "text": "Both direct infection, as well as parainfectious mechanisms, may contribute to a spectrum of neuropathological manifestations associated with viral infections. It is well recognized that viral infections may cause demyelinating disease in humans, including such notable examples, as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis from the measles virus and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy from the JC virus [4] . Coronavirus has proven to be no exception, with previous non-human primate [9] and murine [2, 7] models demonstrating demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) following infection. Previous studies have investigated the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection in the central nervous system (CNS). Isolation of SARS-CoV from infected brain tissue suggests that SARS-CoV is capable of directly infecting the CNS [6, 15] . Additional studies have suggested that angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) protein may be a receptor for SARS-CoV [8] and may be a key to better understanding the pathophysiology of SARS-Cov-2 infections and its complications. ACE2 protein is present in brain endothelium and smooth muscle cells, which raises a potential vascular mechanism of injury. Herein we describe a COVID-19 autopsy case, which illustrates a spectrum of neuropathological findings that include neocortical infarcts, focal hemorrhagic white matter lesions, and discrete foci of acute axonal injury, with associated myelin loss.",

Coronary angiogram demonstrated mid-left anterior descending artery (LAD) obstruction (70%) along with first obtuse marginal artery (1OM) obstruction (70%). In March 2020, he underwent an elective double coronary artery bypass graft surgery. Six days after the procedure, he developed a left-sided pleural effusion and thoracentesis yielded 450 milliliters of serosanguinous fluid. His respiratory status steadily deteriorated, with worsening symptoms and increasing oxygen demand. Chest radiographs revealed patchy bilateral interstitial abnormalities, with the computed tomography (CT) highlighting parenchymal consolidation and surrounding ground-glass opacities following a peribronchovascular distribution.

One day prior to his confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, he developed acute kidney injury (AKI), likely secondary to shock state, respiratory failure, and IV contrast administration. Continuous renal replacement therapy was required for 5 days after AKI diagnosis. He remained critically ill over the following days with a highly inflammatory state, as evidenced by rising levels of CRP, IL-6, and ferritin. Extensive supportive therapies were pursued, including vasopressor support, and stress dose steroids. Despite the initial improvement in gas exchange and lung mechanics, prognosis remained poor, and the family decided on DNR status. The immediate cause of death was attributed to medical treatment-refractory junctional bradyarrhythmia.",

Parainfectious conditions are well known to develop after viral infections, including SARS. In this case, the pathological lesions are distinct and the interpretation is not confounded by underlying severe global hypoxic-ischemic brain injury with concomitant regional infarcts. The striking features of the pathology presented include the range of subcortical white matter pathology, the absence of deep grey nuclei or brainstem pathology, and the lack of typical features of viral and post-viral encephalitides.",

            "text": "We describe several types of pathological lesions that may contribute to neurological manifestations of COVID-19 patients. The widespread hemorrhagic white matter lesions identified have some of the characteristic features of AHLE. Similar hemorrhagic lesions have previously been described with SARS-CoV, but are reported within a background of extensive neuronal necrosis [15] , which we did not observe. AHLE often presents fulminantly and results in rapid death. The relative paucity of significant reactive changes in the case presented suggests that, indeed, these occurred in close chronological proximity to the patient's death. Clearly necrotic blood vessels and perivascular inflammation, however, were not identified in association with the larger hemorrhagic lesions. The prominent acute axonal injury and loss, coupled with preserved remnants of myelin within these hemorrhagic lesions, is also not typical of classic AHLE. Another distinct pathology identified was characterized by small (< 5 mm) white matter lesions with clusters of macrophages and a range of associated axonal injury. Some lesions appeared to be more perivenular in nature, tracking along vessels, resembling an acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM)-like histological appearance. However, the variable perivenular association, coupled with the absence of intracortical and cortical subpial demyelination, absence of cortical microglial activation, paucity of lymphocytic inflammation, and prominent acute axonal injury are not characteristic of classic ADEM [16] . Although not all lesions were clearly necrotic, it is also possible these white matter lesions are vascular in origin. Other lesions had marked central axonal injury, associated extravasated blood, and surrounding myelin loss, reminiscent of subtle \"balland-ring\" microhemorrhages. Whether these white matter lesions reflect distinct pathological processes or a continuum of a single disease is unclear. The neocortical microscopic infarcts identified raise the possibility of microthromboembolic events, possibly related to COVID-19 and associated complications, or in this patient, could be related to his other underlying medical conditions and treatments.",

Parainfectious conditions, such as post-viral autoimmune disorders, have been described in association with a variety of viruses, including coronaviruses (e.g., SARS-CoV), and variety of potential routes of CNS infection have been proposed [15] . The potential explanations of the neurological symptoms include direct infection (e.g. viral encephalitis), metabolic etiologies of encephalopathy, and secondary cerebrovascular insults [14] . Imaging case studies of COVID-19 patients have suggested pathological lesions characteristic of ADEM, and acute hemorrhagic AHLE [11] . Recent descriptions of large vessel cerebral infarcts in patients that would not be expected based upon their age and co-morbidities suggest an underlying vasculopathy or coagulopathy [10] . Research into the pathophysiology of SARS-CoV proposes a role for the viral ACE2 receptor as a potential mechanism of injury [5] . The lack of microglial nodules, the paucity of perivascular and leptomeningeal inflammation, absence of neuronophagia, and preservation of deep gray structures/brainstem/spinal cord distinguish it from other viral encephalitides and would suggest a vascular origin with secondary myelin loss.",

Further complicating the clinical management of these patients is the microscopic white matter lesions, and cortical infarcts would not be readily 1 3 apparent with routine imaging studies. Furthermore, these patients may not be stable, or appropriate, for transporting for more complex imaging studies.
