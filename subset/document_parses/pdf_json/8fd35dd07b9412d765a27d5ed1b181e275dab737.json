            "text": "The onset of corona virus pandemic brought about multiple crises with financial, social, and political dimensions, and problems involving absence or scarcity of medication, food, and other amenities. COVID led to reports of severe hunger, stress, sexual violence, and associated complications. This study was aimed at assessing the prevalence of sexual violence, hunger, stress, indoor fighting, and related complications caused by the corona virus, and determining factors associated with it. Methods: A cross-sectional design study involving a total of 1288 participants recruited from Amhara Metropolitan cities was implemented. Each participant completed a questionnaire regarding experience of sexual violence, hunger, stress, indoor fighting, and other complications faced due to COVID-19. A statistical analysis was done by fitting binary logistic regression model, independent t-test and Chi-squared test. Results: From the total participants, 1288 (26.2%) were displaced, while 39.9% were unemployed due COVID-19. About half of the participants (48.8%) experienced general distress, 33.8% faced sexual violence, 18.2% experienced hunger, 8.4% faced indoor fighting. The majority (81.7%) of non-corona virus patients in government health-care institutions faced lack of treatment. For every unit increase of monthly income during COVID-19, the estimated odds of participants experiencing sexual violence decreased by 31.3% (aOR=0.687). Educational level, work status, and monthly salary before and during corona virus were important factors of hunger. Conclusion: COVID-19 pandemic led to considerably high prevalence of sexual violence, hunger, stress, and indoor fighting. Work status of participants was an important associated factor of hunger, stress, and indoor fighting. Sex of participants and their monthly income were significantly associated with increase in sexual violence during COVID-19. In addition to a general economic recession, a decrease in treatment of non-COVID-19 patients was noticed, particularly in government hospitals.",

            "text": "Following the first infections in China toward the end of 2019, corona virus continued to propagate across the world. No continent or country remained unaffected by the virus. 1 About 1.52 million deaths, more than 65.54 million people infected, and 45.38 million recoveries were reported across the world. 1,2 On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the virus a global emergency and the pandemic impacted the entire world hugely. The pandemic continued to have economic, social, and political impact. 4 The impact of COVID-19 continues as an unsolved public health problem with potentially serious economic and social consequences. The outbreak of COVID-19 is particularly difficult for poor African countries due to their scarce economic resources, weak health system, and social crises. 2, 22 The survey participants reported that about half of the global income and wealth losses occurred due to corona virus, the average losses being 5293 and 33,482 dollars, respectively as well as drops in employment, equity markets, consumer spending, and personal income. 9 Many countries discontinued long-distance travel, closed or reduced civil service working hours, and government and non-government institutions, particularly, schools were partially/fully closed, or resorted to home based studies. 1 Measures taken by developed countries to curb the pandemic involved closing borders and closing offices, which led to increased recession in the world economy in general and in the economy of developing countries in particular. 2 In Africa, the pandemic progressed slowly and its harmful economic impact kept increasing. Key sectors of the African economy already experienced a slowdown because of the pandemic. 2 Movement restrictions and quarantine measures resulted in less trade off, decrease in access to food, and decreased economic activities making the prices of basic items higher. As a result, people are forced to adopt negative handling mechanisms such as reducing food consumption, borrowing money for food. 11 In this respect, female-headed households rather than male-headed ones suffered more adverse effects due to lack of shelter. 11 One of the main preventive measures of COVID-19 that most countries used was lockdown, ie, staying at home. However, lockdown-related stress caused psychiatric problems, worsened emotional tension, and increased food and drink intake causing a dangerous health problem. Low and middle income countries, in contrast faced dietary problems leading to even worse poverty and malnutrition as a result of the corona virus. 23 While school closures had acutely negative effects, mental health of children was exacerbated by lack of peer support and alternative means for mitigating risks. 11 The corona virus crisis stretched poor health systems on the continent. The corona virus patients overcrowded the health facilities and patients with high burden diseases like AIDS, TB, and malaria were unable to obtain sustained care, which in turn led to more morbidity and mortality. 2 Moreover, COVID-19 pandemic created shortage of medicines and health equipment. Weakness and slowness of the health care system led to irrelevant inability to ensure health care for all pandemic patients. 24, 25 Because of the drastic measures to reduced their medical supplies. Consequently, developing countries like Ethiopia faced difficulty in treating their patients after the pandemic gradually reached a critical stage. 2 Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, social stress and gender-based violence are growing exponentially. Many women who are being forced to \"lockdown\" at home face their abusers when services that support them became increasingly inaccessible. 3 In France, Singapore, and Argentina, cases of house fight increased by 30, 33, and 25%, respectively. 8 Since the corona virus outbreak began, such violence has also increased in Africa. 3 Stress, the interruption of social and protective networks, and decreased access to services aggravate the risk of violence. 4 As the world battles with the corona virus pandemic, emerging evidence indicates a sharp rise in genderbased violence in Ethiopia. For women and girls, this would have life-threatening consequences and profound impact on their opportunities and life trajectory. 10 Numerous factors such as misinformation, lack of treatment, shortage of equipment, and lockdownassociated depression, anxiety, etc, aggravate vulnerability to the pandemic. 6 Demographics such as occupation, age, gender, marital status, and occupation are factors that moderate covid-induced stress. COVID-19 led to job losses in Ethiopia. Such measures had especially bad impact on laborers and patients whose life standard relies on the hand to mouth. Owing to COVID-19 pandemic related crises, shortage of food and medical treatments became severe, leading to increased reports of hunger, stress, sexual violence and the like. This study, therefore, aimed at assessing the prevalence of corona related sexual violence, hunger, stress, indoor fighting as well as determining associated factors. Findings from such a study would enable policymakers and health institutions to update and adjust their covid-19 coping strategies.",

As compared to participants from Debre Tabor city, participants from Woldya city were more prone to experiencing sexual violence. This could be due to the fact that Woldya city is a border city interconnecting people from different places and is a site of varied commercial exchange. Participants with low monthly salary during COVID-19 had higher likelihood of experiencing sexual violence. This finding is in line with another finding from another study on women 4,18 which found that, compared to higher income women, poorer women experienced increased sexual violence.

Work status of participants was an important factor that was associated with hunger, stress, and indoor fighting. Monthly income during COVID-19 and sex of participants were significantly associated with sexual violence. Moreover, in government hospitals especially, there was lack of treatment for non-COVID-19 patients. Economically, covid-19 brought a recession. These all call for timely remedial action from the government and other stakeholders. In order to reduce the damage of COVID-19 pandemic would put into question the survival of many among the society whose life hangs on a hand to mouth subsistence. ",
