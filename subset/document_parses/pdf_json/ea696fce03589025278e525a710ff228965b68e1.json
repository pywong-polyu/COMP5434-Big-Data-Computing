These findings were obtained in surveys using self-report questionnaires with pre-specified response options that may not capture the broad range of experiences of individuals affected by cancer, including people with cancer and informal caregivers, in this unprecedented situation. Online forums produce a large amount of valuable first-hand user-generated content that can be used to better understand their day-to-day lives. This study, based on the analysis of narratives in cancer online forums, aims to describe and categorize the experiences of people affected by cancer during the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Method An inductive, descriptive, thematic approach was applied to publicly available cancer forums from Germany, the USA, the UK, and Ireland posted between mid-March and mid-April 2020. Results An analysis of the content of 230 main posts revealed three major themes: (1) concerns related to the impact of COVID-19 on cancer care, the risks and fears of getting infected, logistic issues, and economic impact; (2) adaptation challenges faced at the individual and societal level; and (3) the need for advice including information about COVID-19 and the (self-)management of cancer symptoms and treatment. Conclusion Our qualitative description of the experiences of people affected by cancer during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak can help to improve communication, education, and the development of supportive care strategies. Furthermore, the themes and subthemes identified could potentially inform item development for future self-report questionnaires.",

One German-(i.e., Germany) and three English-(i.e., USA, UK, Ireland) speaking online forums met the selection criteria. The forum site structure included two with a general category or board where users could post any topic related to cancer and two with divided categories for different cancer types (e.g., lung, larynx, leukemia, thyroid, prostate, ovarian/gynecological). Given the public nature of the forums, it is possible that users from other countries accessed the sites and participated in the discussions.",

However, because these sources are not always reliable, they may increase fear-and stress-related disorders [34, 35] . Cancer online forums represent a virtual place to share and seek information and emotional support from peers going through or who have had similar experiences [2, 36] . During the COVID-19 pandemic, people affected by cancer described their preoccupations and concerns about restricted access to healthcare services and how these changes would affect their care and outcomes. People with cancer faced the dilemma of going to the cancer center and potentially being exposed to the virus versus postponing or cancelling their treatment to avoid exposure and having their treatment outcome compromised. This finding is consistent with previous studies that noted that treatment delays or interruptions, as well as concerns related to COVID-19, were the dominant factors associated with fears of disease progression, as well as higher levels of anxiety and depression [13, 30, 34, 37] . In addition and related to the limited access to the healthcare system, an important number of threads corresponded to people suspecting symptoms related to cancer, who sought advice or similar experiences from their peers. We believe that the themes identified in this paper can be used by clinicians when they assess patients' fears and concerns and provide education and self-management support [38] .",

However, due to the social distancing limitations imposed by COVID-19, many individuals who do not use online forums regularly may have viewed this approach as an option to obtain information. Furthermore, specific characteristics of the forums' users (e.g., age, gender, diagnosis, nationality) were not collected in order to maintain privacy. As previously described [21] , these two factors constrain the generalizability of our findings. Another limitation is the potential for cultural differences in the use of the forums. While posts from four different countries were evaluated, three of them were English-speaking and represented mainly Western societies. We further acknowledge that the analyzed period of 4 weeks represents a snapshot, corresponding to the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic in the four different countries. However, taking into account the evolution of the pandemic, these experiences may change over time.",

The themes identified in this study, \"concerns,\" \"adaptation challenges,\" and \"need for advice\", provide insights into the impact that the pandemic has had on cancer care and emotional well-being. The results of this study provide new knowledge on the issues that people with cancer and ICs are dealing with during the pandemic. Clinicians can use these topics to improve communication and education of people affected by cancer and as a result, provide optimal supportive cancer care.
