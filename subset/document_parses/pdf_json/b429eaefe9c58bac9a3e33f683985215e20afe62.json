The search tool uses a novel technique to find similar sequences in the proteins by comparing the physicochemical properties (PCPs) of the amino acids in the query and the target sequence. The differences in the PCP values in the two sequences are then measured by a property distance (PD). Briefly, five quantitative descriptors of physicochemical properties (PCPs) are assigned to each of the 20 amino acids. The five descriptors E1 to E5 were derived by multidimensional scaling of 237 physical-chemical properties for the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, thus the main differences of all 237 properties for the 20 amino acids are reflected by the five descriptors E1-E5. These in turn represent groupings of PCPs such as hydrophobicity, size, or secondary structure propensities, charge, aromaticity and size. The PD of two sequences A and B is then calculated as the average distance between the descriptor vectors E for corresponding amino acids, i.e.:",

The windowed PD measures the sequence similarity of the most conserved portion of the two sequences of length wSize. Note that windowed PD is 0 between two sequences having an identical string of amino acids at a conserved region of length wSize. The occurrence of this is exponentially less likely as wSize increases; for the results in this paper we use a wSize of 22 amino acids. Windowed PD can be computed naively by considering each pair of wSize subsequences in turn and computing their PD. A more efficient approach exploiting the linearity of PD is to slide a window of length wSize along and compute PD incrementally, for each offset of the shorter sequence along the longer one, and keeping track of the smallest PD value found.",

Aligning very diverse sequences, especially those containing multiple repeats or insertions, can be quite difficult (28) . D-graph, as a flexible sequence analysis tool for protein sequences, provides a valuable first step to obtain an overview of related viral species without the need for an alignment. DGraph is unique in that it implements the PCP descriptors and PD calculations which were previously validated in our work in comparing allergenic proteins and their epitopes (6, 29, 30) . No hypothesis about an ancestral sequence is required to follow inter-strain differentiation. As Fig. 1 illustrates, simply starting with a list of unaligned sequences in FASTA format, one can rapidly determine the interrelatedness of sequence data from two different virus families, the FV and EV (12), whereby the PD approach can give more detailed clustering than simple Clustal scores. As Figure 2-4 shows, automatic calculation of the PD values between even large groups of viral sequences yields PD-graphs consistent with what is known of the their vector, host range, receptor type (particularly for the \u03b2-CoV, Fig. 4) and disease phenotypes.",

The D-graph program works from a list of unaligned sequences and can also use additional data, while allowing the user to adjust the program parameters to obtain results even for very distantly related sequences. PD-graphs suggest evolutionary paths between distantly related viruses. PD-graphs emphasize the nonlinearity of viral evolution that may be missed when using linear phylogenetic trees to model the evolution of viral groups whereby there is no implied directionality in the connecting lines, which only represent the mathematical relationship between pairs. However, the PD-graph analysis of the FV (Fig. 2) has features that correlate with suggested paths for the divergence of the mammalian pathogens. The clustering emphasizes the central position of YFV, relative to both mosquito and tick born viruses and the \"mosquito only\" viruses.",

This may account for the relative stability of the YFV genome compared to that of the DENV types, which must have evolved under pressure from mammalian immune responses (34) . Another interesting feature of the PD-graph is the grouping according to known host even when isolated from geographically very distant places. Entebbe (node 23) and Yokose (node 24) viruses, which were isolated from bats in Uganda (ENTV) (43) and Japan (YOKV) group together, but also have strong connectivity to other mosquito borne viruses. The YOKV sequence cross reacts with antibodies in sera from humans infected with DENV or after vaccination with YFV (35) and, depending on the protein area chosen, is similar to many different mosquito borne FV. Some of the early reports were not conclusive about the cross-reactivity of ENTV with other FV (44, 45) . PD-graphs could provide testable hypotheses on FV cross-recognition, by comparing graphs made using inter-strain ELISA values and PD values.",

The sequences were automatically downloaded from a Blast search, identical sequences removed and the resulting FASTA files subjected to Clustal W analysis or our PD based method with minimal involvement (except that the sequence headers were manually shortened and the sequences inspected to remove fragments). The resulting maps, which are similar to how PFAM B families are generated, show how PD-maps show a finer distinction among the viruses than simple Clustal scores using an unsupervised alignment. Table 1 with FlaviTrack ID, Genbank, species name and length of amino acids. Starting from the unaligned FASTA sequences of the polyproteins, the program calculated pairwise PD values of all corresponding 22-residue segments for the polyproteins. The average PD values of the windows was used as a metric for the similarity of each pair. Lines in the figure indicate the degree of relatedness of the sequences, with a color code from blue to green as indicated with the PD values on the left of the figure. Blue thick lines indicate highly related flaviviruses. Divider lines and boxes were drawn by hand to emphasize the phenotypic groupings of the viral species. ",
