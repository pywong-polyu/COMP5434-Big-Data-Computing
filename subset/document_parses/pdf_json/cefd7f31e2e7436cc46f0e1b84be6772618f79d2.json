Methods SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels were measured by ELISA over 1 year among 136 health care workers infected during the first COVID-19 wave and in a subgroup after booster vaccination approximately 1 year later. Furthermore, spikeprotein-reactive memory T cells were quantified approximately 7 months after the infection and after booster vaccination. Thirty healthy individuals without history of COVID-19 who were routinely vaccinated served as controls.",

Among individuals with history of COVID-19, booster vaccination induced very high IgGand to a lesser degree IgA-antibodies. Antibody levels were significantly higher after booster vaccination than after recovery from COVID-19. After vaccination with a two-dose schedule, healthy control subjects developed similar antibody levels as compared to individuals with history of COVID-19 and booster vaccination. SARS-CoV-2-specific memory T cell counts did not correlate with antibody levels. None of the study participants suffered from a reinfection. Conclusions Booster vaccination induces high antibody levels in individuals with a history of COVID-19 that exceeds by far levels observed after recovery. SARS-CoV-2-specific antibody levels of similar magnitude were achieved in healthy, COVID-19-na\u00efve individuals after routine two-dose vaccination.",

It has become clear that the strength of the immune response underlies considerable interindividual variability, and decreases with age and over time [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Reinfections have rarely been reported, and generally follow mild courses. However, surrogate parameters for and the duration of protection from reinfection have not been defined so far. Only few studies addressed time periods longer than 6-8 months and especially parameters of cellular immunity have been insufficiently studied to date [5] [6] [7] [9] [10] [11] .",

This indicates that natural SARS-CoV-2 infection obviously leaves a considerable number of memory B cells and plasma cells that allow for a rapid reuptake of antibody production in large amounts, even if levels have become low or even undetectable before, as has been shown recently [22] [23] [24] . In line with previous reports, we could demonstrate antibody levels of similar magnitude both in booster-vaccinated individuals with previous COVID-19 and in fully vaccinated controls [24, 25] .",

The memory T cell response was numerically, but not statistically lower among vaccinated COVID-19-na\u00efve controls than among individuals with past COVID-19, an observation that should be further studied. To date it is still unclear, whether cellular or antibody-mediated immunity is the dominant factor in long-term immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and whether the differences demonstrated between the various vaccines are of clinical relevance [18, 30, 31] .",

This provides a \"real-life\" picture of the antibody level dynamics over time, and after vaccination. No reinfections were observed among the study participants, but given the generally low reinfection rates, the number of individuals enrolled is clearly insufficient for drawing conclusions which of the studied immunological parameters might indicate protection from reinfection. Such parameters are an important topic of current multicenter studies with considerably higher numbers of participants.",
