Daycare centers are critical infrastructures that cannot be replaced, even during the COVID-19 period. However, the existing settings in daycare centers may pose risks of inevitable close contact between teachers and children, as well as fomite and airborne transmission during care hours. Therefore, reinforced mitigation strategies have been applied in daycare centers to reduce potential indoor virus transfer in many countries. However, numerous outbreaks of COVID-19 have been reported in daycare centers. Therefore, in this study, researchers focused on the risk and behavior of long-distance virus transmission based on the detected viruses on air purifier filter sampling in a daycare center outbreak in Korea. Various experiments of possible situations were conducted in nursing rooms based on field interviews. The experiments monitored the longdistance transmission behavior of aerosol-sized particles and visualized particle behavior at the daycare center. The results of this study revealed that long-distance virus transmission is possible under the current settings in the daycare center, and flush-out can be an important countermeasure with reinforced ventilation methods to prevent potential airborne spread in the daycare center. The results of air purifiers represented that air purifiers should be properly installed and operated in the daycare center to prevent airborne virus spread by airflow during occupied hours. The findings of this study will contribute to the understanding of airborne virus risk and the development of customized virus measures for daycare centers.",

            "text": "To date, three primary routes of SARS-CoV-2 infection have dominated virus transfer: contact and droplet transmission, fomite transmission, and airborne transmission (WHO, 2020a) . Contact and droplet transmission refers to SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission through direct or indirect contact with bodily secretions (e.g., saliva, respiratory droplets) discharged from an infected person within a short-range (Medicine, 2020; Leung, 2021; WHO and Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) , 2020). Respiratory droplet transmission can occur when people closely contact an infected person within 1 m (WHO, 2020a) . This is the most common route of virus transmission. Fomite transmission represents an indirect infection through touching or contacting surfaces contaminated by an infected person. Previous papers found viruses on object surfaces in field samples of places where infected patients had been (Chia et al., 2020; Razzini et al., 2020) . However, there is still an argument about the possibility of this transmission route. Marsalek (2021) pointed out that 'possible' does not represent the extent of its 'likelihood, ' and Goldman (2020) indicated that the chance of fomite transmission is not significant. Airborne virus infection is a transmission route through aerosol-sized droplet nuclei containing viruses from the carrier. Aerosols are typically equal to or less than 5 \u03bcm in diameter, and they are exhaled through normal breathing and conversation (WHO, 2014) . In SARS-CoV-2 transmission, viruses containing aerosols can float in the air and be delivered over long distances (WHO, 2014; Yu et al., 2021; Morawska et al., 2020) . Thereby, vulnerable people can become infected by inhaling aerosols if they are exposed to enough viruses to cause infection (WHO, 2020a) . Even though there have been many discussions on infectivity and long-range transmission of aerosols in the scientific community, the World Health Organization (WHO) has acknowledged the potential of airborne transmissions, such as in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor environments (WHO, 2021) . Similarly, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recognized that the SARS-CoV-2 virus could be transmitted across a six-feet distance from infected people (CDC and Scientific Brief, 2021) .",

This study confirmed a significant relationship between exposure to environmental air pollutants and the incidence and fatality of the SARS-CoV-2 based on the scientific evidence from previous articles. Kim et al. (2021) discussed the potential risk of Particulate Matter (PM) as a container of infectious diseases (e.g., . This study represented a suggestion that the national codes and standards should consider the monitoring of indoor air pollutants and control guidelines for better indoor air quality controls in multi-use facilities. Maleki et al. (2021) conducted a systematic review of 167 studies (19 articles selected) to identify the association between PM and SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The researchers concluded that the positive role of PM was verified to deliver viruses and promote airborne dispersion of COVID-19. Therefore, the risk of airborne transmission should be carefully controlled, especially in daycare centers, to protect young children.",

Airborne transmission is possible since nursing teachers and children spend several hours in closed spaces every day. For example, from January to March 2021 in Korea, there were 36 cluster outbreaks in daycare centers and kindergartens, with a total of 635 (n = 17.6 cases/place) confirmed cases. According to health authorities (KDCPA, 2021a), the risk factors in daycare centers and kindergartens were the attendance of symptomatic patients, many close contact activities (e.g., meals and play activities), and insufficient wearing of masks and indoor ventilation. Therefore, health authorities have recommended no school attendance or prompt virus tests of people suspected of being infected (e.g., fever, respiratory symptoms, etc.) to prevent cluster infection. However, despite many efforts, cluster outbreaks have been continuously reported in daycare centers. Notably, the cluster infection in Sejong, Korea, provided indirect evidence of potential airborne virus transmission in the daycare centers. In the R-daycare center, viruses were found on the air purifier prefilters in sampling tests, including samples from a patient-free nursing room (KDCPA, 2021b). Further, in the epidemiological investigation, there were no identified routes through direct contacts between infected persons for inter-room transmission.",

In Korea, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) has guided and updated responses to COVID-19 for daycare centers. The latest guidelines (MOHW, 2021b; MOHW, 2021c) require that daycare centers designate staff in charge of infectious disease control and perform prevention activities of virus infection. Mitigation activities are also recommended for daycare centers. For example, cleaning the main spaces, air filtering, and frequent natural ventilation are encouraged during childcare hours to eliminate airborne contaminants. The direct wind from heating and cooling systems and the recirculation of indoor air should be minimized. To prevent close contact transmission, the spaces in daycare centers should be disinfected every day, and educational items and stuff (e.g., toys, books) with which children and childcare staff frequently come into contact should be sterilized at least twice a day. During the childcare program, direct contact with children, staff, or visitors is not recommended. Indoor and outdoor programs are expected to maintain at least one person per 4 m 2 and the quarantine guidelines (MOHW, 2021b; MOHW, 2021c) . Ehrhardt et al., 2020) . In many countries, infectious disease controls to prevent SARS-CoV-2 have been stipulated for daycare centers and schools. The WHO has provided the prevention and control measures to support preparation for COVID-19 and to ensure the indoor safety of students and teachers at schools (WHO Coronavirus disease (COVID-19): Schools, 2020; WHO, 2020b) . The CDC has updated its \"Guidance for Operating Child Care Programs during COVID-19\" to supplement the legal systems (e.g., laws, rules, and regulations) of federal and regional public health and safety. This includes COVID-19 prevention measures and guidance for child care providers (CDC, 2021a; CDC, 2021b) . The federal state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Germany provided preventive measures to stay healthy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus when reopening schools and childcare facilities in 2020 (Ehrhardt et al., 2020) . Key points of the above-mentioned control measures are early screening of potential patients, contaminant removal and behavioral prevention methods, occupant density controls, and control measures for primary transmission routes (e.g., close, fomite, and airborne transmission).",

The CDC's Science Brief (CDC and Science Brief, 2021) reported that children and adolescents could transmit contagious viruses to other people. The cumulative infection rates in children aged 0-4 years are approximately half that of children aged 5-17, which is almost equivalent to those in seniors aged 65 years or older. In a study conducted by Lopez et al. (2020) , researchers verified that children in daycare centers are significant sources of virus transmission (Lopez et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020) , even though the conditions of the 12 infected children observed in three daycare facilities were mild or asymptomatic. In the contact tracing of 3 small to large child care facilities in Salt Lake County, Utah, 12 people were infected due to contact with the children outside the daycare centers, including parents and siblings, which represents the possibility of children transmitting SARS-CoV-2 viruses to their parents and teachers from daycare centers. On the contrary, in research in Finland, Haapanen et al. (2021) confirmed that social distancing (e.g., lockdown of schools and daycare) could be helpful to reduce respiratory diseases. The immediate impact of the closures in schools and daycare centers was found on the controls of virus transmission, and the effect was maintained for several weeks. After the lockdown, the re-opening of schools and daycare centers had no immediate impact on the outbreaks of any respiratory pathogens.",

In another study, Walger et al. (2020) pointed out that the lockdown of schools and daycare centers may have only a limited impact on the further transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus due to low symptoms and severity. This is because the rate of symptomatic infections between children and adolescents is lower than among adults (Walger et al., 2020; CDC COVID-19 Response Team, 2020; Chidini et al., 2020) , and serious cases of the SARS-CoV-2 virus are not common in the children group (CDC and Science Brief, 2021) . However, some researchers have indicated that the lower rates of virus infection in children might be due to lower exposure (e.g., school, daycare, and activity lockdown) and virus testing opportunities compared to adults (Reese et al., 2021) .",

Nevertheless, 36 cluster outbreaks have occurred since January 2021, with a total of 635 confirmed cases related to daycare centers and kindergartens (Table 2 ). Among all confirmed cases, indoor transmission in the daycare facilities was 45.5% (n = 289/635 cases), and the additional transmission out of the daycare facilities was 54.5% (n = 346/635 cases). The main transmission route was nursing teachers and students. They were infected in external facilities (e.g., homes, academies, churches, multi-use facilities). Then, infected teachers and students spread infectious particles to other teachers and students as virus containers in daycare centers and kindergartens. Newly infected teachers and students transmitted contagious viruses to their household members and acquaintances. In total in-house cases, the rate of daycare staff was 41.9% (n = 121/289 cases), and the rate of infected students was 58.1% (n = 168/289 cases) (KDCPA, 2021a). Therefore, in order to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 in daycare centers, daycare centers should minimize the transfer from outside through reinforced virus measures, including regular body temperature checks and preemptive virus tests. Further, mitigation methods (e.g., natural ventilation, air purification, and sterilization) should be appropriately operated to remove infectious contaminants in the air and on the surfaces of objects to ensure a safe indoor environment in daycare centers.

Before the COVID-19 outbreak, cooling systems were not operated at the daycare center. The center was not equipped with mechanical ventilation systems, and thus natural ventilation through windows was the only way to introduce fresh outdoor air into nursing rooms during the pandemic. To supplement this, air purifiers were installed in each nursing room to improve indoor air quality. The air purifier in the nursing rooms was a 75 m 2 -type product with dual fans and three-stage air filtering, including 1) microfiber prefilter, 2) double deodorization filter, and 3) all-in-one composite filter (deodorization + fine particulate matter) and stand-alone air purifiers were installed in the hallway, nursing room #1, and playroom. The air filters were replaced by the manufacturer's service every two months. Before the COVID-19 outbreak, the daycare center typically opened windows for natural ventilation and operated air purifiers during the daytime. The details of the facility and cluster outbreaks are provided in Table 3 and Fig. 1 .",

The air temperature differences between indoors and outdoors were smaller than those in winter due to the air temperature rise in the spring season. Thus, in the case study building, outdoor air would not be sufficiently introduced in the spring, and the indoor airflow would be stagnant during the virus spread period. Therefore, indoor airborne virus transmission between hallways and adjacent classrooms was traced using virus-like particles in this study. Virus-like particles were sprayed in the potential virus sources (e.g., index case, first symptomatic patient, teacher's meeting). In addition, the potential risk of no flush-out before and after space use was explored by monitoring unoccupied hours. This result shows the significance of flush-out for occupants the next day. For the experiment, an oil droplet generator, a smog generator, IAQ sensors, laser equipment, and various other sensors were utilized. A total of 10 air quality sensors were installed to detect virus-like particles in the nursing rooms and hallway.",

In Fig. 4(a) , the virus spread from the infected location was tested in the classroom using an oil droplet generator. The virus-like particles were generated into NR3 (age 2) for 20 min to simulate airborne virus transmission under normal class operating conditions. In Figure 4 (b), 40 min of observation after Fig. 4(a) shows how airborne virus-like particles can be spread in the R-daycare center during the afternoon cleaning time when the infected patient left the classroom. During the experiment, the indoor room temperature (T db ) of NR3 (age 2) was 22.7-24.5 \u2022 C, and the relative humidity (RH) was 58.3-64.4%. Outdoor weather was 24.0 \u2022 C and RH 62%, and wind speed and wind direction were 1.7 m/s and 140 \u2022 , respectively (KMA, 2021). Fig. 4 and Table 6 show the patterns of airborne transmission under the actual ventilation conditions in the R-daycare center. In Fig. 4(a) , when virus-like substances were sprayed with the regular classroom conditions for 20 min, the virus-like substances were transferred from NR3 (age 2) to NR2 (age 2) through a shared restroom (IAQ#2). In the corridor (IAQ#3) adjacent to NR3 (age 2), the concentration of viruslike particles increased from 36 to 715 \u03bcg/m 3 . This confirmed that virus-like particles could diffuse into the hallway due to air leakage through the door gaps. In terms of the possibility of long-distance transmission, the concentration of NR1 (age 1) (IAQ#7), 29.5 m away from the test site, increased by 33 \u03bcg/m 3 compared to before the experiment. In particular, after 19 min, the particle concentration increased from 14 to 29 \u03bcg/m 3 in NR1 (age 1) (IAQ#7), which indicates that virus-like particles can reach long distances through the air. However, the ratio of reaching virus-like substances is relatively low Fig. 4 . Airborne contaminant transmission from nursing Room3 (age 2). compared to air contaminant sources. By contrast, 40 min of monitoring was conducted for airborne diffusion during cleaning time. The virus-like particle concentrations of NRs 2-3 (age two) and adjacent spaces were reduced due to natural ventilation and airborne transmission to the neighboring spaces. The concentrations of virus-like particles in the long-distance nursing rooms increased due to dispersion by indoor airflow movement, as shown in Fig. 4(b) . This result indicates that virus-like particles could reach other adjacent spaces in a 40-min period under ventilation conditions during cleaning time. During the cleaning time, the reduction rate of virus-like particles was 76.5% in NR3 (age 2). Since the existing literature recommends at least 95% virus removal through outdoor air for safety (ASHRAE Epidemic Task Force, 2020), the current removal performance was not sufficient to lower airborne virus concentration and control airborne virus transfer between indoor spaces. Above all, all multi-rooms in the daycare center were connected by the central corridor, which limited natural ventilation performance during the daytime. Therefore, to sufficiently mitigate airborne contaminants, the daycare center should extend the ventilation hours in the cleaning time or install mechanical systems to increase the outdoor air ventilation rates in nursing rooms.",

Among these, NR3 (age 2) was tested in Section 4.1. Thus, in this section, NR2 (age 2), where the index case stayed, and NR (age 3), where daycare teachers had a meeting (May 17th), were tested as potential virus sources.

The highest concentrations were found in the shared restroom (IAQ#2), NR2 (age 2), and hallways (IAQ#3), neighboring with NR3 (age 2) (IAQ#1).

Similarly, the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW) (MOHW, 2021b) encourages natural ventilation before and after occupancy in daycare centers, but there is no specific guidance for flush-out operations (e.g., required ventilation volume, operating methods). Thus, the impact of natural ventilation before and after occupancy in daycare centers is not clear. In general, daycare centers in Korea have 12 h of unoccupied time, m 3 )   IAQ#1  IAQ#2  IAQ#3  IAQ#4  IAQ#5  IAQ#6  IAQ#7  IAQ#8  IAQ#9  IAQ#10 Class Time (20 min from 7:30 p.m. to 7:30 a.m. before open hours. If air contaminants are not fully removed after use, they may remain in the indoor air until the next morning. In the field study, the R-daycare center performed natural ventilation before class hours and during cleaning time. However, whether the virus transmission at an unoccupied time was prevented was not identified in the epidemiological investigation of the entire daycare center. Therefore, this experiment monitored how virus-like particles could be transmitted to neighboring rooms during the unoccupied time when an infected patient exhaled infectious viruses during the daytime, and no flush-out was conducted after space use. Table 9 shows the unoccupied time conditions when the daycare center closed. The test was carried out in NR (age 3) (IAQ#9), and the particles were ejected at 20 psi for 15 min. The concentration change of airborne particles in the daycare center was observed for 15 h from the evening to the next morning. At this time, the indoor environmental conditions in NR (age 3) were 23.3-25.0 \u2022 C of air temperature and 50.3-58.6% of relative humidity. Outside air conditions were 17.4-25.9 \u2022 C of indoor air and RH 43-79%. Wind speed and direction in the outdoor environment were 0.0-1.6 m/s and 70-320 \u2022 , respectively (KMA, 2021) .",

In particular, in NR2 (age 2) (IAQ#5) and NR3 (age 2) (IAQ#1), which are farthest from the virus source (NR (age 3), the extent of changes was not notable during the over 12 h. In NR2 (age 2) (IAQ#5) and NR3 (age 2) (IAQ#1), the concentration of virus-like particles peaked after 3 h from the ejection start, and then the density of particles decreased only up to 29.4-30.5% after 9 h. In overnight monitoring, NR (age 3) (IAQ#9) showed 65.8% of the reduction rate compared to the peak concentration during 12 h. However, the total concentration reduction of virus-like particles ( Fig. 6(b) ) from all measured indoor spaces was only 38% during 12 h and 44% during 14 h after the peak value through air leakage. The decrease in the total concentration of the daycare center implies that the virus-like particles sprayed from NR (age 3) (IAQ#9) were diffused to other adjacent spaces during unoccupied nighttime. This result also indicates that the airborne virus can be trapped in nursing rooms during the unoccupied time. Thus, if effective measures are not applied in the nursing rooms before and after occupancy, particles would be transferred to the other rooms over long distances during nighttime. This means that teachers and students in the daycare centers can be exposed to infectious diseases the next day through nighttime long-distance transmission without direct contact with the infected person. Therefore, sufficient ventilation before and after space use can be helpful in preventing residual airborne contaminants transfer before reopening the facility the following day.",

Further, the R-daycare center opened windows and operated the air purifiers in auto mode during class time. Despite such efforts, cluster infections occurred in the daycare center.

However, the performance of mitigation strategies can vary depending on the indoor and outdoor environment. Therefore, to verify this, this section monitored the concentrations of virus-like particles from NR (age 3) (IAQ#9) and NR2 (age 2) (IAQ#5) for 40 min after 20 min of virus-like particles sprayed in Section 4.2. During the experiment, windows, and doors were opened, and the air purifiers operated in strong mode. Fig. 7 and Table 11 show the virus removal trends in NR (age 3) (IAQ#9) and NR2 (age 2) (IAQ#5). Since environmental differences affect the airborne transmission of virus-like particles depending on the location of the virus ejection source (e.g., NR, age 3 (IAQ#9) and NR2, (age 2) (IAQ#5)), mitigation impacts of natural ventilation and air purifiers can be differentiated in nursing rooms. For example, in Fig. 7(a) , the concentrations of virus-like substances in NR (age 2) (IAQ#5) were reduced within 20 min in most spaces. However, since NR-age 3 (IAQ#9) represented a faster indoor diffusion rate than NR-age 2 (IAQ#5), several spaces could not be completely mitigated within 40 min. Therefore, in order to prevent cluster infection through airborne contaminant transmission in daycare centers, it is important to develop customized plans for the facilities, including ventilation hours or rates based on the actual spread and removal rates in indoor spaces. For this, additional mechanical ventilation devices or new ventilation windows should be considered for the daycare center.",

Long-distance transmission from potential virus sources was simulated using aerosol-sized particles and sensor monitoring in nursing rooms. Typically, spring in Korea is dry and warm, and thus, the efficiency of natural ventilation is lowered due to the reduced air temperature differences between indoors and outdoors. Therefore, natural ventilation may not be sufficient in facilities without mechanical ventilation systems or air filtering devices. Previous studies have verified the effectiveness of high-performance air filters in alleviating the potential transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (Agarwal et al., 2021; Mousavi et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020; Kapilan and Rao, 2021) . However, the impact of the air purifier on virus removal performance is affected by the operating modes. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to evaluate the filtering performance in NR3 (age 2) (IAQ#1), where the first symptomatic patient was found. The concentration fluctuations of the virus-like particles were measured according to the operating modes (e.g., strong, weak, off) using a wall-mounted air purifier. The windows and doors were closed during the experiment to exclude the influence of natural ventilation. The virus-like particles were sprayed at 20 psi for 20 min using the oil droplet generator, and then the particle removal performance was measured for 40 min. Indoor environmental conditions during the monitoring were 23.3-25.5 \u2022 C of room temperature and 48.8-56.7% of relative humidity. Table 12 shows the case scenarios for the air purifier used in this study. Fig. 8 and Table 13 show the time-series transfer and summary of the virus-like substances when the air purifier was operated in three different modes in NR3 (age 2): 1) off, 2) strong (S) mode, and 3) weak (W) mode. In the weak (W) mode, the concentration of virus-like particles was reduced by about 27% after 1 h compared to the condition with no air purifier. In the strong (S) mode, the wall-mounted air purifier confirmed an approximately 86% reduction in aerosol-sized particles. This evidence of operating modes verified that air purifiers were effective for infectious virus controls compared to the 5.8% reduction with the no air purifier. Although the impact of air purifiers can vary depending on installation methods and capacity, air purifiers can be regarded as an alternative to alleviate the spread of infectious substances and supplement insufficient outdoor air fractions during opening hours at the R-daycare center.",

The risk of direct wind from HVAC systems has been identified and discussed in several studies (Yu et al., 2021; Lu et al., 2020) and guidance (ECDC, 2020; KDCPA, 2020; Kwon et al., 2020) . Therefore, in this section, the impact of installation methods on transmission behavior was verified using the laser visualization experiment using a stand-alone air purifier. In the R-daycare center, two types of air purifiers were used, such as a wall-mounted type in most nursing rooms and stand-alone types installed in the hallway, nursing room #1, and playroom. Since the wall-mounted air purifiers were already installed above the height of the child and their wind direction avoid occupants, the stand-alone air purifier was selected and tested for improvements on installation and operations. Fig. 9 shows the visualized diffusion characteristics of virus-like particles between a stand-alone air purifier and air contaminant sources. Fig. 9 (a) shows the behavior of virus-like particles when the virus source was located in the lower front of the air purifier. In this case, most of the virus-like particles were out of the exhaust path for purified air from the outlet grill. Therefore, most airborne contaminants were sucked into inlet pores for filtering, and then the purified air was discharged into the indoor air. However, the result in Fig. 9 (b) shows the potential risk of virus transmission boosted by the air purifier. When virus-like particles were scattered in the exhaust path of the diffuser grill, direct airflow from the grill pushed the airborne contaminants into the indoor space without filtration. Therefore, to reduce the potential risk of installation and operation methods in air purifiers during the pandemic, the air purifier should be installed higher than the height at which people breathe, or its outlet direction could be set to avoid occupants. These implications can help ensure the effectiveness of the air purifier with virus safety in closed spaces.",

The concentration of the viruslike particles was traced in real-time to monitor airborne transmission and contaminant removal rates by natural ventilation and air purifiers in the experiments. In addition, the removal performance of the air purifiers was confirmed using particle concentration and laser visualization observation, depending on the ventilation and air purifier operation modes. Even though the R-daycare center fully complied with governmental quarantine actions of health authorities before the outbreak (e. g., fever checks, disinfection, personal protection equipment, and limited visits of external visitors), the COVID-19 outbreak could not be prevented in the daycare center. This fact implies that further research and effort are thoroughly required to improve virus safety in multi-use facilities, such as daycare centers. For example, the risk from Indoor and outdoor air contaminants should also not be overlooked to ensure the occupant's health, which can influence the airborne virus transmission and severity/mortality of infectees.

After 15 h, the researchers found that 34.2-71.7% of these airborne virus-like particles remained in the rooms compared to the peak time concentrations. The next morning, concentrations of virus-like substances were equalized in most spaces without complete removal. This indicates that when airborne contaminants are not sufficiently eliminated after use or before reopening at daycare centers, airborne viruses can be delivered over long distances to virus-free spaces during the night. Since the SARS-CoV-2 virus can survive in aerosols for hours and up to days on surfaces, depending on the environmental conditions (ECDC, 2020; KDCPA, 2020), the possibility of airborne transmission at unoccupied hours should be carefully considered for safety. This result, therefore, recommends sufficient flush-out before and after occupancy to take precautions against possible long-distance exposure of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in daycare centers.",

Even though there is a potential risk of delivering virus-like particles by direct airflow from the air purifier outlet, given the extended stay of teachers and children in the closed space, air purifiers with highperformance filters should be considered as an additional measure.",

            "text": "4) The climate of the external environment can affect the indoor diffusion characteristics of virus-like particles in daycare centers. In spring, natural ventilation through windows in daycare centers is lowered due to the reduced air temperature difference between indoors and outdoors, and the outside wind speed is also lower than in winter. In the results of the R-daycare center, complementary measures (e.g., longer ventilation hours, additional ventilation windows, or mechanical ventilation) are recommended to ensure better safety from airborne viruses, regardless of seasonal changes. 5) In the experiments, the transmission paths of airborne viruses were mainly affected by source location (e.g., nursing room), usage behavior (e.g., door and window open/closed), and architectural layouts (e.g., interior partitions and walls). The source locations (e.g., Nursing room-2 (Age 2), Nursing room-3 (Age 2), Nursing room (Age 3)) influenced the transmission direction, time, and concentrations. Hallways were primary paths to transport virus-like particles between nursing rooms. Lastly, restrooms between nursing rooms are vulnerable if an infected person emits virus-containing aerosols into the space while using the restroom. If restroom doors were not closed during the daytime, the restrooms located between nursing rooms could also be used as a path. Therefore, restroom doors between nursing rooms should always be closed during open hours, and personal hygiene after the use of the restroom is recommended. Therefore, the potential transmission paths determined by source location, usage behavior, and architectural layouts should be controlled to reduce the possible airborne transmission in buildings.",

The threats of invisible viruses and evolved infectivity require people to be prepared for every situation in buildings. In addition, although the virus transmission routes in buildings have been identified in many parts, the outbreak location and the scale of infection vary due to different building environments. This study analyzed the possibility of airborne virus transmission based on the evidence of viruses found in the air purifier filter samples in a cluster outbreak case of the R-daycare center and identified mitigation performance of the daycare center. Several experimental scenarios were conducted to understand the behavior of airborne virus-like particles and diagnose the effectiveness of the current mitigation measures. The experiments verified that the results of airborne virus transmission can be used to describe the long-distance transfer in the actual outbreak. Therefore, the findings of this study should be considered to improve the readiness of daycare centers during the pandemic, especially in Korea, because many daycare centers are exposed to similar building environments like R-daycare center.",

The behavior and actual infectivity of the SARS-CoV-2 virus would very vary depending on indoor and outdoor environments (e.g., virus source location, discharge rates, patient behavior, and indoor and outdoor climatic conditions). Therefore, further studies are necessary to confirm the possibility of airborne SARS-CoV-2 virus transmission through several case studies. ",
