These measures resulted in school closures, social isolation, and job loss, which all contributed to increased psychosocial stress, particularly among families with pre-existing vulnerability factors. Given the relationship between increased psychosocial stress and intimate partner violence (IPV), this rapid review investigated change in the prevalence and correlates of IPV victimization during the first six months of the pandemic. PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane COVID-19 registry were reviewed. This search resulted in 255 unique results, of which 24 studies were included. There were 19 studies that examined changes in the rate of IPV from before the COVID-19 pandemic to during the pandemic. Of the studies examining changes in the rate of IPV, 11 found a significant increase. Key vulnerability factors contributing to the increase include low socioeconomic status, unemployment, a personal or familial COVID-19 diagnosis, family mental illness, or overcrowding. Six studies examined whether the presence of children in the home was associated with IPV, but the direction of this relationship was inconsistent. This review finds preliminary evidence of a relationship between COVID-19 induced stressors, pre-existing vulnerabilities, and increased IPV, which present important implications for policy and practice.",

At this point, there were 118,000 COVID-19 cases across 114 countries. By September 28, 2020, cases globally had increased to 2,128,438, with 35.72% of cases in North America, 28.90% of cases in South-East Asia, 26.92% of cases in Europe, 6.02% of cases in the Eastern Mediterranean, 1.28% of cases in Africa, and 1.16% of cases in the Western Pacific (World Health Organization, n.d.) . Almost all countries enacted lockdown measures to control the spread of COVID-19 in March 2020 (Onyeaka et al., 2021) . Common shelter-in-place policies included physical distancing, working from home, and closing non-essential businesses and schools. These restrictions were consistent across many geographic regions (Haug et al., 2020) , and social and economic disruption emerged globally as a consequence of the strict public health measures. In addition to the societal-level effects, family-level disruption occurred, which prompted the question: did intimate partner violence (IPV), which is known to be associated with family-level stress (Lucero et al., 2016; Weitzman & Behrman, 2016) , also increase during the early stages of COVID-19? Based on this question, in this rapid review, we aimed to investigate change in the prevalence, correlates, and impacts of IPV victimization during the first six months of the pandemic.",

Specifically, the absence of social isolation has been found to protect against IPV (Fernbrant et al., 2014) . A systematic review examining intimate partner violence against Chinese women found that formal and informal social control is protective against IPV (Cao et al., 2021) . Cao et al. (2021) also concluded that good health is protective, which is understandable given that a final protective factor is regular contact with a family physician, because the primary care setting is a critical environment for detecting IPV (Peralta & Fleming, 2003) .",

            "text": "As a result of the strict public health measures implemented to control the spread of COVID-19, it is possible that the prevalence of IPV was impacted. Brink and colleagues (2021) examined changes in IPV in Europe during the initial weeks of the pandemic. They found that the prevalence of IPV increased in six countries, while decreasing in two and remaining the same in two. Empirical studies have shown that stay-at-home orders and social distancing measures have increased women's vulnerability to IPV and further obstruct access to their support networks (Bradbury-Jones & Isham, 2020; Usher et al., 2020) . Additionally, a rapid review by completed by Mojahed et al. (2021) examined social and geographic isolation in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, and they found a significant association between social and geographic isolation and increased risk of IPV. Furthermore, pre-existing vulnerabilities, in conjunction with new stressors emerging from the pandemic, increase the risk of IPV exposure (Boserup et al., 2020) . For instance, many households face increased financial strain because of the pandemic; 12.4% of Canadian paid workers were laid off in response to COVID-19 (Statistics Canada, 2020) . This speaks to experiences of marginalized groups (Bowleg, 2020) . These findings gain importance as economic vulnerabilities are a critical indicator of increased rates and severity of IPV (National Institute of Justice, 2009). Still, it should be noted that the association between IPV and economic hardship is likely reciprocal (Renzetti & Larkin, 2009) .",

            "text": "Couples with children (in contrast to those without) may have also experienced increases in IPV during the early stages of the pandemic. Prior to the pandemic, IPV occurred disproportionately within families with children, specifically when young children were present within the home (Bair-Merritt et al., 2008) . As previous studies have demonstrated that women with children are more vulnerable to IPV (Peek-Asa et al., 2017) , increased IPV becomes a likely consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic and further highlights the importance of a family system lens in conceptualizing this phenomenon. Both social disadvantage and exposure to IPV are related to poor developmental outcomes for children (Evans et al., 2008; Pingley, 2017) which exemplifies the importance of understanding how COVID-19 related stressors have contributed to cumulative psychosocial risk among families. Reviews assessing the precipitating factors contributing to changes in IPV during the pandemic are limited. Thus, it remains unclear how the increased stress resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic influenced rates of IPV and whether there was a disproportionate impact for specific groups (e.g., low SES, families).",

The second objective was to explore what driving factors contributed to IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, pre-existing vulnerabilities and COVID-19 induced stressors were both examined. We also explored whether there was a differential impact on rates of IPV for couples with and without children because school closures were a unique challenge to couples who are also parents.",

The \"strategy for data synthesis\" portion of the protocol was updated and resubmitted, and the protocol was accepted for registration on November 23 rd , 2020. Rapid reviews offer unique benefits not seen in other types of reviews. Rapid reviews are particularly beneficial in the context of public health emergencies, such as COVID-19, when policy makers require timely evidence for health system decision making (Tricco et al., 2017) . By expediting the review process, appropriate policies and resources can be established to support survivors of IPV throughout the remainder of the pandemic. Furthermore, by pre-registering and adhering to evidence-based scientific standards, the quality of the review can be maintained (Tricco et al., 2017) . One limitation of this method is that grey literature was not examined. The search was restricted to papers published in English, with data collection taking place during the first 6 months of the pandemic (i.e., before September 11 th , 2020, six months after the World Health Organization declared the pandemic), and the raw dataset of studies was created on October 30, 2020. This period was selected because a global lockdown occurred at this point of the pandemic, and nearly every country in the world implemented some degree of domestic lockdown (Onyeaka et al., 2021) . Additionally, the early months of the pandemic consisted of great economic uncertainty and increased financial stress at the individual level, as well as increased fear and decreased access to education (Onyeaka et al., 2021) . Given this is a global review, selecting an early timeframe when most countries in the world were locking down allows us to draw more concrete conclusions across geographic regions. Data needed to be included regarding the prevalence of IPV and/or the factors contributing to IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic. PsycINFO, MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed, Scopus, and the Cochrane COVID-19 Study registry were searched. The article title, abstract, and keyword fields were examined using the following search string: ((\"COVID-19\" OR Coronavirus OR \"SARS-CoV-2\") AND (\"family violence\" OR \"domestic violence\" OR \"domestic abuse\" OR \"domestic conflict\" OR \"marital conflict\" OR \"intimate partner violence\")). Quantitative, empirical study designs (i.e., randomized controlled trials, non-randomized control trials, interrupted time-series studies), qualitative interview studies, analytical observational studies (i.e., retrospective cohort studies, case-control studies, and cross-sectional analysis), and mixed methods studies were included. Reviews, as well as comments, editorials, and letters to the editor were excluded.",

The second stage of reliability focused on examining the full-text reports for abstracts where there was uncertainty about inclusion. Independent reviewers overlapped on 20% of the remaining studies, and interrater reliability at this stage was k = 1.0. Data extraction was then completed for all studies meeting the inclusion criteria. The type of study and time of data collection were recorded, as well as the country where the study was conducted. Sample characteristics were noted including age group(s), sample size, population, ethnicity, SES, household composition, and relationship status.

This tool is a revised version of the quality assessment tool for Studies with Diverse Designs (Sirriyeh et al., 2012) . This tool was selected because the reviewed studies employ a range of designs, and this tool shows strong inter-rater reliability and content and face validity across study designs (Sirriyeh et al., 2012) . The tool employs 13 questions to assess quality. For each article, questions were scored between 0 (not at all) and 3 (complete). Studies were not excluded based on their quality, but the results are reported, and the information was considered when drawing conclusions. In our PROSPERO registration, we stated that two reviewers would perform a risk of bias assessment based on a series of five questions. Because of the range of studies reviewed, the QuADS tool was selected to better capture the different methodologies. Resource limitations also meant that only one reviewer performed the quality appraisal. Popay and colleagues' guidelines (2006) were used to inform narrative data synthesis, which offers the best method to synthesize data from studies employing different methodological approaches. A preliminary synthesis took place whereby findings were organized to describe the vulnerability factors contributing to IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic. Any significant findings showing a difference in IPV prevalence or precipitating factors between couples with and without children were noted. Patterns across studies were also examined and the direction and size of effects were determined (Popay et al., 2006) . Next, relationships between the data were explored to understand any differences in results between studies. Table 2 presents key findings from all the individual studies that meet inclusion criteria (see Appendix 1). Key findings were extracted from each study and summarized individually in the results section. Trends and similarities across studies were noted, and the findings were used to frame the discussion, where specific policy recommendations were made.",

Five studies analyzed forensic data and six studies examined hospital admissions data Finally, two studies examined call logs to domestic abuse helplines and one study looked at referral data for a domestic abuse program. Ten studies performed primary data collection or analyzed multiple variables based on secondary data. Nine of these studies explored differences in IPV across different groups at one timepoint or asked participants to retrospectively consider how their experience of IPV changed since the start of the pandemic. One of the highest quality studies in this review used an interrupted time series design to examine changes in self-reported IPV (Hamadani et al., 2020) . Given the nature of the data presented in this review, no causal inferences about the relationship between COVID-19 and IPV can be made, and all conclusions are correlational.",

Murphy et al. (2020) found an initial reduction in orthopedic referrals, but the proportion of IPV related cases remained stable. Gosangi et al. (2021) found an overall decrease in IPV survivors seeking hospital care during the COVID-19 pandemic (146 in 2017; 106 in 2018; 104 in 2019; and 62 in 2020) (p < 0.001), but they revealed a higher incidence of lethal physical violence including strangulation and use of weapons. The percentage of survivors of physical violence was 12% in 2017 to 19 compared to 42% in 2020 (p = 0.01) (Gosangi et al., 2021) . Olding et al. (2021) reported a decline in the proportion of physical traumas resulting from IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic in comparison to past years (89% from March 23 rd to April 29 th , 2019, and 63% from March 23 rd to April 29 th , 2020). Similarly, Halford et al. (2020) found a decrease in IPV during the pandemic, based on police records. Halford et al. (2020) argue that while it is possible the decrease is genuine, it is likely attributable to decreased reporting.",

            "text": "Different types of IPV were examined across studies including physical, psychological, and/or sexual violence. The six studies examining emergency department trauma consults and admissions were limited to physical violence (Blackhall et al., 2020; Hassan et al., 2020; Jacob et al., 2020; Murphy et al., 2020; Olding et al., 2021; Rhodes et al., 2020) . Two studies found an increase in the incidence of lethal IPV involving weapons (Gosangi et al., 2021; Rhodes et al., 2020) . Specifically, Rhodes et al. (2020) demonstrated that penetrating assaults increased from 2.6% of all assaults before the COVID-19 pandemic to 18% during the pandemic. Hamadani et al. (2020) examined changes in the rate of victimization and revealed that all types of IPV increased during the pandemic. Based on self-report of participants' experiences of both physical and psychological IPV during the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological IPV was noted as more prevalent than physical IPV (Gebrewahd et al., 2020; Hamadani et al., 2020; Iob et al., 2020; Sediri et al., 2020) . Iob et al. (2020) found that psychological violence was significantly more common than physical violence (8.3% compared to 2.9%, respectively; p < 0.05). Finally, in an interview and questionnaire study, Gebrewahd et al. (2020) reported that psychological violence was the most common type of violence (13.3%) followed by physical violence (8.3%). The results indicate that verbal IPV is more Unemployment and low SES were frequently associated with an increase in IPV, with findings from seven studies indicating a relationship between job loss, unemployment, or low SES and an increase in IPV (Bracewell et al., 2020; Davis et al., 2020; Gebrewahd et al., 2020; Iob et al., 2020; Jetelina et al., 2021; Payne et al., 2020; Sabri et al., 2020 ) Ag\u00fcero (2021 and Leslie and Wilson (2020) reported no relationship between SES and the prevalence of IPV. A significantly higher percentage of IPV was reported among women who were unemployed (psychological abuse = 14.7%; physical abuse = 6.7%) compared to those who were working (psychological abuse = 7.8%; physical abuse = 2.4%) (Iob et al., 2020). Jetelina et al., (2021) found that IPV was significantly more prevalent for survivors who experienced job loss or loss of income during the pandemic (OR = 1.63; 95% CI 1.17 to 2.27), compared to survivors whose income was not affected. Davis et al. (2020) found that individuals who lost their job due to COVID-19 were 2.5 to 3 times more likely to be survivors of IPV. Finally, Sabri et al. (2020) performed qualitative interviews with 45 immigrant women in the United States who have experienced IPV. A common concern that emerged was increased stress resulting from the social and economic disruption, as well as financial hardship.",

When compared to survivors without a mental illness, those with a mental health diagnosis were significantly more likely to experience psychological violence (6.5% vs. 15.9%, respectively) and physical abuse (2.3% vs. 5.7%, respectively) during the pandemic (Iob et al., 2020). Iob et al. (2020) also compared the prevalence of abuse across participants with severe, moderate, and mild depression and anxiety symptoms, based on the PHQ-9 (Kroenke et al., 2001) and GAD-7 (Spitzer et al., 2006) , respectively. Participants with severe depressive symptoms were significantly more likely to experience psychological (26.5%) and physical (12.0%) abuse compared to those with mild (psychological abuse = 4.6%; physical abuse = 1.2%) symptoms. Participants with severe anxiety were also significantly more likely to experience psychological (21.5%) and physical (9.1%) abuse compared to those with mild (psychological abuse = 5.7%; physical abuse = 1.6%) symptoms. Sediri et al. (2020) found that violence during lockdown was associated with higher depression and anxiety for IPV survivors. Finally, qualitative interviews revealed that factors such as more caregiver demands, economic stress, and social isolation negatively impacted mental health for immigrant survivors (Sabri et al., 2020) .",

One theme that emerged was a concern for child welfare. A study conducted in Norwegian refuges, which are shelters for IPV survivors, found that 83% of staff reported concern for children (\u00d8verlien, 2020). Common concerns include decreased connection and support. Finally, qualitative interviews conducted by Sabri et al.

            "text": "Based on this rapid review, there is some preliminary evidence that physical, psychological, and sexual IPV increased during the early stages of the pandemic, particularly for those with pre-existing vulnerabilities. This is supported by our result that 11 of 19 studies examining changes in the prevalence of IPV during the pandemic found an increase. Although the quality appraisal scores did not differ between studies that found an increase in IPV (M = 65.27) and studies that did not find an increase (M = 65.06), there are qualitative differences between the studies included in each group. Of the studies that found an increase in IPV, 18.18% of studies used hospital-based data. In contrast, of the studies that found no change or a decrease in IPV, 50.00% of studies used hospital-based data. This is an important difference because emergency departments observed an overall decrease in patient volume during the pandemic (Nourazari et al., 2021) , and hospital findings indicating a decrease in IPV could be linked to this overall decrease in treatment seeking. In addition to examining the prevalence of IPV during the pandemic, this study sought to understand the influence that pre-existing vulnerability factors and COVID-19 induced stressor were having on rates of IPV. Four correlates of IPV during the pandemic emerged. Our results revealed that unemployment and low SES were associated with an increased prevalence of IPV. There was also a relationship between pre-existing mental illness, a personal diagnosis of COVID-19, and overcrowding, and an increased rate of IPV. It remains unclear whether the prevalence of IPV during the pandemic differs between couples with and without children. However, one theme that emerged in two qualitative studies was a concern for child wellbeing during the pandemic.",

In response to the pandemic, primary care (e.g., family health teams, primary physicians) rapidly shifted to telemedicine to limit the spread of COVID-19 (Webster, 2020) . In doing so, it is possible that IPV survivors lost an important point of contact for disclosing their experience of violence. This is because a limitation of telehealth during the pandemic is that abusive partners are more able to monitor help seeking attempts by listening during videocalls (Ragavan et al., 2020) . As a result, a greater number of survivors might feel unsafe disclosing. Health policymakers need to consider the implications of having family physicians working virtually for survivors of IPV.",

Providing government financial assistance and subsidized housing for individuals who are unemployed because of the pandemic could help mitigate some of the structural factors contributing to further marginalization among vulnerable groups.

Social isolation is one consequence of the public health restrictions implemented to prevent the spread of COVID-19 (Brown et al., 2020) . One example of community connection that was lost in response to the pandemic was community babysitting, where volunteers checkin with families where abuse is occurring, and this has been shown to be protective (Sabri et al., 2020) . To compensate for the lost social support during the pandemic, communities need to ensure that people experiencing IPV can stay connected virtually. Creating accessible and confidential virtual services (e.g., peer support groups, counselling) for survivors is critical. In addition to providing adequate online alternatives for those previously accessing in-person IPV services, ensuring that people experiencing IPV for the first time can adequately connect with resources is crucial. Past online interventions have demonstrated the effectiveness of social media and smartphones in safety planning (Rempel et al., 2019) , and implementing similar interventions throughout the pandemic could help support women who are unable to access in-person services. Given the reciprocal relationships between IPV, low SES, and job loss, ensuring that survivors are provided with the technology necessary to stay connected with formal and informal support networks will help to promote resilience.",

However, we know that children being at home and learning virtually has increased family stress (Hiraoka & Tomoda, 2020) , and increased stress can adversely impact rates of IPV for vulnerable families (Bradbury-Jones & Isham, 2020). There is also the risk that children are being exposed to a greater frequency and severity of IPV. We know that child abuse is increasing throughout the pandemic (Brown et al., 2020) ; however, no studies have examined the mental health implications resulting from children witnessing IPV throughout COVID-19. Although six studies examined the relationship between children in the home and IPV, the findings were inconclusive. A crucial future research direction will be understanding the influence that this potential increase in exposure to IPV is having on children.",

A systematic search strategy was used to ensure a comprehensive synthesis of the literature. It is unlikely that studies meeting inclusion criteria were missed; however, it should be acknowledged that only six databases were screened, and grey literature was not examined. Furthermore, new literature related to COVID-19 and IPV has emerged rapidly throughout 2021, and the conclusions drawn in this review are based only on literature available before October 30 th , 2020. As a result, caution is required if generalizing the results of this review to periods beyond the early stages of the pandemic.

This review provides preliminary evidence that IPV has increased in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This increase is linked with certain intersecting vulnerabilities, particularly job loss, low SES, pre-existing mental health challenges, a personal or familial diagnosis of COVID-19, and crowded living. Understanding the precipitating and vulnerability factors contributing to the increase in IPV is necessary to ensure that policy focuses on protecting the most vulnerable throughout the remainder of COVID-19. Ideally, future research should examine the longitudinal impact of COVID-19 on rates of IPV. Drawing on past self-report data of IPV before the pandemic and following up throughout the remainder of the pandemic would be an ideal design. Because the psychosocial and economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic have become disproportionately negative for people at marginalized social locations (i.e., ethnic/racial minorities, people with disabilities, or low SES) (Bowleg, 2020) , research focusing on marginalized communities is also needed.",

The impact of children being home more frequently on rates of IPV during the pandemic remains unclear and should be examined in future investigations.
