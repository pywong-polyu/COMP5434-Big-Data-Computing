            "text": "Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, NYC hospitals were inundated with COVID-19 infected patients, which in its most severe form progressed to acute respiratory distress syndrome, renal failure, and associated cardiovascular and neurologic sequelae. 5 Usually these complications were seen in the second phase of the illness (7-10 days after symptom onset), triggered by a hyper-immune response associated with a markedly elevated D-dimer. 6 Along with this was a newly described 'COVID associated coagulopathy' which led to increasingly observed thrombosis due to inflammation-induced coagulopathy and was associated with a poor prognosis. 1,2 Anticoagulation with heparin (mostly prophylactic dosing) appeared to confer a lower mortality in a subset of patients with very severe COVID-19 who had extreme elevations of D-dimer. 7 Others reported increased rates of VTE in patients with COVID-19 in the ICU, despite the use of prophylactic anticoagulation. [8] [9] [10] [11] A recent report describing profound haemodynamic collapse due to acute cor pulmonale in five patients in an ICU over a 48-h period suggested that obstructive shock from thromboembolism may have been responsible for the sudden decline, but could not be confirmed in all patients. All were on prophylactic or full-dose anticoagulation, and two of the five patients had evidence of intracardiac thrombus on echo at the time of collapse. 12 Additionally, in another report, right ventricular dilatation identified by echocardiography in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was independently associated with increased mortality. 13 A CIT, as seen in our case, in a patient already diagnosed with saddle PE and right ventricular dysfunction could rapidly lead to catastrophic shock and death, if undiagnosed and untreated. We also observed three additional cases at our institution of CIT in COVID-19 patients that presented in the later phases of the disease with profound haemodynamic and respiratory collapse. Despite the high mortality rate associated with CIT, though, there are no recommendations on how best to treat CIT in the most up to date ESC guidelines. This likely reflects the paucity of evidence and consensus on management of this phenomenon. Involvement of a multidisciplinary team to manage PE is encouraged in the new guidelines to meet these types of concerns. 14 Combining the conundrums of COVID-19 infection with those of suspected or confirmed PE, especially with CIT, merges two clinical entities that lack robust data to guide decision-making. Pulmonary Embolism Response Teams are uniquely positioned to address this scenario as they can respond rapidly and bring a group of multidisciplinary experts together to provide consensus based and individualized recommendations. A modified PERT algorithm to address some of the unique challenges posed by VTE in the setting of COVID-19 was recently described. 15 Hence, we utilized our multidisciplinary PERT to improve our clinical decisionmaking and come to a rapid consensus on the best management approach for this patient.",
