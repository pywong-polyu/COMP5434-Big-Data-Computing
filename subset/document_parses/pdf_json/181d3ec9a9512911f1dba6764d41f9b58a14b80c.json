We distributed 2.3 million masks at the peak of the shortage of personal protection equipment (PPE), kept on the cutting edge of financial opportunities like tax incentives and loans, fought to expand access to telehealth, and so much more. 6 All the while, we were acutely aware of the toll the pandemic was taking on employees at high risk of emotional fatigue and burnout.",

A recent report issued by the CDC found that 53% of public health workers have experienced symptoms of depression, anxiety, PTSD, and suicidal ideation during the pandemic. 9 The National Council's response matters. It's not enough to hand out masks and hand sanitizer. Providing meaningful resources also requires developing a culture of support through programs to boost mental health, especially for our at-risk mental health and substance use treatment providers. Our webinars, blogs, consultations, and training all make a difference. But it's up to us to explore new ways to support those who chose to work in this rewarding, but frustrating field.",

As Rachel Petts and her team discovered in their examination of patient and provider experiences at a Federally Qualified Health Center (FQHC), while integrated care is good for both patients and providers, it's not without its challenges. 10 Our CCBHC Success Center 11 celebrates our success, but we don't shy away from those challenges. More importantly, we help CCBHCs meet and overcome challenges with implementation and operational support, advocacy initiatives, current data, and general information. Want to find a CCBHC? Go to our CCBHC Locator Tool. 12 With a few clicks of the mouse, you can learn about one of the 340 CCBHCs across the country. By the time you read this Reflection, there will undoubtably be more.",
