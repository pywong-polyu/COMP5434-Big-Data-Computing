While much of this literature falls within the domains of anthropology, science studies, and sociology, this short introductory paper highlights how geographical scholarship can also enrich emerging transdisciplinary debates on uncertainty. Specifically, we discuss how geographers engage with uncertainties produced through and reconfigured by some of the most formidable issues of our contemporary moment, including neoliberal transformation, disease and illness, resource conflict, global climate change, and ongoing struggles around knowledge, power, and justice. In conversation with debates in cognate fields, this special issue brings together contributions that grapple with uncertainty through key geographic concepts such as scale, power, spatiality, place, and human-environment relations. This work extends scholarly understanding of how uncertainty arises, is stabilized, and also how people navigate, experience, challenge, and rationalize uncertainty in everyday life. In doing so, we signal the immense potential offered by emerging intersections between human geography and broader critical social science interventions on the question of uncertainty. (B. King).",

They are, for instance, endemic features of neoliberal transformation, health-environment interactions, food (in) security, natural disasters, resource conflict, and global climate change. While the question of uncertainty is not new, it increasingly captivates popular imagination in the context of these highly dynamic, contested and intractable problems, thereby catalyzing academic interest across the social sciences. Yet despite the pervasiveness of uncertainty in daily life and forms of academic inquiry, few of the contributions associated with this transdisciplinary literature are geographical. As a consequence, this special issue demonstrates new ways that geographers can enrich work in this field, while also highlighting the potential of the concept to reshape approaches to topics, themes, and foci that the discipline actively pioneers.",

            "text": "The articles in this special issue collectively respond to two trends that have historically sidelined the influence of critical human geographic scholarship in transdisciplinary debates about uncertainty. First, while the problem of uncertainty has received substantial attention in academic work across the fields of science and technology studies (STS), anthropology, sociology, and development studies, texts that explore uncertainty through a critical and explicit engagement with geographical concepts are relatively few and far between (we discuss some recent and promising exceptions below). Second, within the discipline of geography itself, the question of uncertainty has largely been interrogated by quantitative and spatial perspectives that have given rise to various taxonomies of incertitude (Kwan and Schwanen, 2018; Kwan, 2012; Griffith, 2018) . Fewer geographers, however, use qualitative and ethnographic methodologies to explore how the limits of knowledge become spatially generative, and/or operate as a direct force shaping social life. This is surprising given that the question of uncertainty is increasingly intertwined with contexts and problems that human geographers have long engaged, such as globalization, disease and illness, migration, and ongoing struggles around knowledge, power, and justice. Furthermore, the multiple challenges and/or opportunities created by uncertainties in such contexts arise from and often rework central preoccupations in the subdiscipline of critical human geography; namely, socio-spatial and human-environmental relationships. Approaches from human geographers could therefore help enrich existing work through their perspectives on scale, power, spatiality, place, and human-environment relations.",

We bring together papers that were presented at the 2018 annual meeting of the American Association of Geographers as part of two sessions organized around the question of uncertainty. Our contributors engage with a wide spectrum of qualitative methodologies and empirical case studies in order to examine how uncertainty shapes places and landscapes, social relations, human health, and/or human-environment interactions. While these articles grapple with diffuse subjects, including banana disease, wolf management, pest eradication programs, and human health (HIV, CKDu, and silicosis), taken together they clearly articulate several key themes for future geographic scholarship.",

A key point here is that while uncertainty can restructure social and ecological relationships, it does so in highly differentiated ways, often with unanticipated effects.

Drawing on a rich tradition of scholarship within the discipline of geography, our contributors grapple with what Robbins (2012, 234) describes as \"the stubbornness and intractability of certain properties of non-human things\" such as the fugitive chemistry of suspected toxin(s), unstable viral loads, materially ambiguous and uncooperative agricultural pests, and illegible wildlife. These complex human-non-human interactions pose important challenges to western scientific and regulatory traditions with \"huge implications for the practice of science, management and policy\" (Scoones, 2019a, 5) . Indeed, the frequent failure to classify, record, and regulate unruly human-non-human dynamics opens up possibilities to engage with more experiential forms of learning, diverse knowledges, and democratic responses to the question of uncertainty. In short, these papers speak to Ian Scoones' (2019b) call to revolutionize \"methodologies for science and policy that take uncertainties seriously\" by exploring engagements with \"experimentalism, citizen participation, transformative action and 'post-normal' science.\"",

On the one hand, several articles demonstrate how uncertainty is strategically deployed in ways that individuate responsibility for environmental risk. In particular these studies demonstrate how uncertainty is often weaponized to reproduce both the imperceptibility of links between health and environment and the unaccountability of the structural forces that produce them. On the other hand, the papers in this special issue explore the potential of embracing uncertainty as a pathway to open \"up a more rigorous, robust, transparentand democratically accountableenvironmental politics\" (Stirling 2018, 120) .

Zavestoski et al.'s (2004; 161) research into Guld War Syndrome for instance, has argued that these experiences of exclusion often give rise to new collective subjectivities and illness groups which contest 'what they see as\u2026 unresponsive medical [legal, and bureaucratic] system[s]' (also see Dumit, 2005; ; Brown, Morello-Frosch, and Zavestoski, 2011) .

This includes work that foregrounds the indeterminacy and partiality of knowledge claims that \"put[s] ambiguity to critical use\u2026 through demonstrating how social categories such as woman or man, black or white, straight or queer as well as concepts such as identity and selfhood need not be fixed in order to inform scholarly inquiry of structural and unstructured dynamics of power\" (Hayes-Conroy and Hayes-Conroy 2008, 469; also see: Sedgwick 2008) . For example, a recent review article by Loren March (2020) provides a route into the affective and biopolitical implications of liminality, foregrounding experiences of disorientation, performativity and embodiment among trans and queer folks who do not conform to the dominant grids available for categorizing bodies. By destabilizing binary identity categories, this work documents how illegibility and in-betweenness are experienced and produced through space. In dialogue with this work, other scholars investigate how uncertainty generates new forms of social difference and subjectivity that reinforce patterns of vulnerability (Auyero and Swistun, 2009; Chung, 2020) . Together this work encourages us to think more deeply about uncertainty as a lived and spatiotemporal condition and prompts us to engage with the disorienting and sometimes potentially deadly consequences of being in-between.",

Much of this scholarship grapples with how uncertainty articulates with narrow, modernist views of progress, development, and technocratic risk management (Scoones, 2019a; Scott, 1998; Ferguson, 1994) . This theme is taken up by Paprocki (2019), who investigates how donors and development agencies translate uncertainty about climate change into, narrowly defined, normative visions of development in coastal Bangladesh. These \"anticipatory development futures\" elevate commercial shrimp aquaculture and the expansion of an urban-based, industrial economy as preferred adaptation strategies in the face of uncertainty, despite significant evidence that these adaptation regimes result in environmental degradation, agrarian dispossession and 'development-induced migrations.' As Paprocki (2019. 307) argues, these forms of anticipatory governance \"entail the end of rural livelihoods in the delta, replacing them with a highly stylized (and age old) vision of development where the rural population transitions into an industrial labour force.\" This work thus brings debates about uncertainty, governance and accountability into sharp relief, demonstrating how uncertain ecological crises can be claimed and mobilized by donors and development agencies to justify interventions that continue to displace agrarian lives and livelihoods.",

The purpose of this special issue is not to deny the significance of these interventions, but instead to explore how key geographical concepts such as scale, spatiality, place, and human-environment relations can deepen and enrich transdisciplinary conversations on the question of uncertainty. We argue that the relative silence of geographers in these debates is a missed opportunity for the discipline, especially given our scholarship on related themes as well as a long history of critical approaches to many of the topics that are at the heart of this literature. Together, this signals the potential for geographical contributions to transdisciplinary debates.

This theme helps demonstrate how uncertainty can be spatially fixed at key moments, either due to necessity, strategy, or through institutional action. Reflecting this concern, Arielle Hesse's paper examines attempts to regulate respirable crystalline silica, which is carcinogenic dust that is generated through hydraulic fracturing. The expansion of natural gas extraction in the United States has introduced new forms of risk for workers and competing understandings of how to regulate silica exposure. The article is an excellent case study of how the industry attempts to construct illegible geographies in efforts to fend of regulation. By documenting the spatial and temporal flexibility of the worksite, Hesse demonstrates how geography is strategically enrolled to position the hydraulic fracking industry as unknowable and thus, ungovernable. In doing so, she demonstrates how the variable spatial and temporal configuration of the industry is used to stabilize uncertainty about particular health risks and outcomes for workers. While uncertainty can persist and accumulate through spatial relationships, several of the articles also wrestle with how uncertainty comes to be functional or rational at some scales yet is counterproductive at others. As one example, Nari Senanayake examines local attempts to neutralize biomedical uncertainty about Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology or CKDu, in Sri Lanka's dry zone. Given resource constraints and generic treatment regimes, Senanayake argues that the disease that is most frequently enacted through clinical encounters is actually an undifferentiated form of kidney disease that envelopes both regular and mysterious forms of illness (CKD/CKDu). While the absence of diagnostic closure in kidney disease clinics enables important improvisations in the practice of care, it also inadvertently stabilizes uncertainty about actual disease burden at higher scales of analysis. Specifically, she demonstrates how uncertainties about disease states compound across scales of knowledge production and how this then frustrates attempts to map the prevalence of CKDu at regional or national levels.",

On the one hand, a hesitancy to share information on wolf populations can protect mid-level bureaucrats from external political pressures to delist the species from the Endangered Species Act. On the other hand, Martin asserts that illegibility \"from above\" undermines agents' ability to effectively intervene around their charges and guarantee wolf conservation over the long dur\u00e9e.

Indeed, Cavallo shows how farmers negotiate differing claims to certainty regarding the disease through a range of tactics that do not fully align with theories of the environmental subject as an extension of state logic. Instead, compounding uncertainties allow farmers to make claims on the state and re-envision agricultural systems in ways that accommodate greater experimentalism, particularly in the face of uncertain plant health risks. Discussion of uncertainty as a strategic resource is also evident in Martin's analysis of controversial wildlife management in the American West.

Yet in grounding this form of knowledge translation with local livelihood practices, the article effectively demonstrates how safe use education elides contextual political economies and hybrid practices that result in lived experiences of uncertainty. This leads Shattuck to conclude that \"smallholder farmers are not operating from a complete deficit of knowledge. Rather their knowledge of toxicity and risk is partial, situated in a particular context, laced with uncertainty and inequality, and often gained from embodied experience.\" The article thereby offers us a conceptual route through which to consider the entanglements between situated knowledges of risk and socio-ecological possibilities.",

Indeed, to a large extent, all of the papers in this special issue are concerned with how uncertainty is differentially experienced and embedded in multiple, interlinked struggles that constitute daily life (such as poverty and political marginalization) as well as, individual experiences of resource scarcity, health, and/or disease. Along those lines, Brian King's article details the ongoing uncertainties with HIV in rural South Africa even within a setting that has drastically scaled-up the provision of care. The widespread provision of anti-retroviral therapy in the Global South has led public health institutions to identify HIV as a chronic condition; however, there remain a wider set of related uncertainties that include ongoing stigma, food insecurities, and unequal bodily responses to treatment. King concludes that given these dynamics, HIV uncertainty and certainty simultaneously co-exist and are co-produced, while remaining materially uneven for those managing their health. Likewise, Cavallo (2020) and Shattuck (2020b) , illustrate how different forms of government intervention in response to uncertainties about plant disease management and pesticide use can reproduce patterns of socio-spatial inequality, normalizing risk and harm for some bodies and not others. As a consequence, our contributors demonstrate how uncertainty is frequently enrolled in the production of social, spatial, and ecological difference.",

In dialogue with McGoey, 228 (2007) ; (2012;)), Martin demonstrates how this apparent dysfunction is not a breakdown of bureaucratic rationality but rather is \"indicative of a rational strategy [for managing antithetical demands] in itself.\" Instead of precipitating more experimental and adaptive management approaches, Martin demonstrates how the frequent failure to record and manage unruly nonhuman dynamics can end up reproducing forms of bureaucratic rationalityeven when uncertainties are central to managing socioecologically complex systems.

Together the special issue invites geographers to grapple with how uncertainty often generates politically opposing ways of problematizing and intervening in human-environment and socio-spatial relationships. For instance, in this collection, several articles demonstrate how materializing health-environment interactions as uncertain have become powerful strategies for affirming ambiguity about toxic and pathogenic exposures, and ultimately, of fending off stricter government regulation (also see: Murphy, 2006) . Shattuck (2020a) examines farmers' knowledge of pesticide risk in Northern Laos in the wake of individually focused safe use messaging and enduring uncertainties about chemical harms. By documenting how situated experiences of toxicity articulate with safe use models, she demonstrates that local typologies of safety and harm continue to blame poor, 'risky' people for pesticide-related health impacts \"instead of the socio-economic situations that require them to take risks\" in the first place. Partial knowledge about the impacts ofand responsibility forchemical exposures in this case, is marshalled to reinforce and legitimate individually based risk management. In the context of rural poverty, uneven access to health care and local inequalities, this approach renders invisible the myriad ways that farmers' decision making is refracted by other risks, principally the risks of being poor and rural.",

Specifically, this article reveals how the processes of rulemaking as well as the variable spatial and temporal configuration of the fracking industry helps decentralize and individualize responsibility for exposure. Similarly, King (2020) asserts that the \"production of uncertainty is relational and dynamic, changing not only with new 'certainties' about the virus and treatment protocols, but also the ways in which its management intersects with social and environmental dynamics.\" This reveals how the experiences of living with HIV are not uniform and continue to be shaped by a range of factors, such as socio-economic resources, food insecurity, employment, gender, age, and sense of responsibility for others.

As part of this analysis, she demonstrates how alternative methodologies for visualizing pest presence/absence as well as bottom up diversified farming practices reconceptualize pests as neither exceptional nor temporary, but instead, as part of a new normal. Doing so, opens up possibilities for alternative agro-ecological and political arrangements by locating the region's pest problem not with the insects themselves but in production systems that lack resilience to biological invasions. As a consequence, Sedell reveals how uncertainty about pest presence/absence can precipitate a fundamental re-evaluation of California's agro-environmental system, and simultaneously transform our relationships to pest populations and how the region produces food. How networks of cross-species relations are productive of 'new ecological accommodations' or 'ways [of] learning to live endemically with our viral [microbial, and insect] companions' (Greenhough 2012, 295) thus constitute important avenues for future geographic research on the politics of uncertainty.",

In other words, this work opens up space for engagement with uncertainty as more than a temporary phenomenon but as a \"permanent condition\" where stability and certainty about socio-spatial and human-environment relationships are often elusive (Brown and Damery 2009, 82) . Rather than attempting to ensure a strict boundary between knowledge and its opposite, our contributors encourage us to think more deeply about uncertainty as a lived and spatiotemporal condition. It is these very entanglements between uncertainty, environments, and everyday life that provide the narrative thread uniting this diverse collection of articles. While engaging with a broad range of topics and qualitative methodologies, this work coalesces around four central themes: (1) how uncertainty works through geographic relationships; (2) how uncertainty generates geographical outcomes; (3) how uncertainty is reconfigured by human-non-human dialectics; and, (4) how uncertainty raises questions about politics. In doing so, this special issue develops a critical human geography of uncertainty, which not only articulates how the concept is useful for geographers, but also, argues that geography can enrich existing transdisciplinary work on the subject with its perspectives on scale, spatiality, power, place, and human-environment relations.",
