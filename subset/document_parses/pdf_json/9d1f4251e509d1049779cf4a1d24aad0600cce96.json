Elective medical treatment was substantially reduced but urgent diagnostics and treatment including cancer care should not have been affected. Materials and Methods: We analyzed the number of oncology admissions to 75 German Helios hospitals during 2 time periods in 2020 and compared the data with the respective periods in 2019. The study included nearly 69,000 admissions in total. Results: A highly significant reduction in overall cancer admissions was seen for the early lockdown period from 13 March to 28 April 2020 compared to the same period in 2019. After an official communication advising the health system to return to normal practice on 29 April 2020, we again found a highly significant difference in admissions compared to the respective time in the previous year. Subgroup analysis shows a significant impact of age > 75 years, high hospital volume, and intermediate or high COV-ID-19 case volume in the federal states. Gender had no impact on admission numbers. The effects and significance levels were comparable in nearly all different diagnostic subgroups according to the ICD codes. Conclusions: For cancer diagnosis and treatment, we found a statistically significant decrease in hospital admissions in the range of 10-20% for both study periods in comparison to the previous year.",

We employed Poisson GLMMs with log link function for count data. Effects were estimated with the lme4 package v1.1-21 [3] in the R Environment for Statistical Computing v3.6.1 (64-bit build) [4] . In all models, we specified varying intercepts for the random factor. The IRR values for the different factor levels were based on different models comparing the periods. Additionally, we employed another model for each factor with the variables period, treatment contrasts for the factor levels (for comparisons with the level at baseline), and the corresponding interactions. We report incidence-rate ratios (calculated by exponentiation of the negative of the regression coefficients) together with 95% confidence intervals (CIs, for the comparisons of the 2 periods) and p values (for the interactions). For all tests, we applied a 2-tailed 5% error criterion for significance. Table 1 shows the results for the total number of cancer patients. We compared the numbers in the study cohort with those in the control cohort for the early and the late period, respectively, and found a highly significant decrease in hospital admissions in both periods. We analyzed several subgroups (age, gender, hospital volume, and COVID-19 case volume) separately for the early and late periods, and confirmed a significant difference between study cohort and control cohort in all of these subgroups. This shows that the impact of the lockdown was independent of age, gender, the size of the respective hos- pital (large full-service hospitals and small hospitals), and the number of COVID-19 cases in the federal states in which the hospitals are located.",

A significant interaction was seen for hospital volume and COVID-19 case volume, showing a more pronounced reduction in hospital admissions in both study cohorts in larger hospitals than in smaller hospitals, and also a higher impact in federal states with high COVID-19 case numbers than in those with lower numbers. Gender had no impact on admission numbers. Table 2 shows the results for the different cancer diagnosis groups separately. Again, study cohorts were compared to the control cohorts in both time periods, respectively. In the early period, a significant difference was seen in all diagnostic groups, with the exception of malignant neoplasms of the male genital organs for which only a borderline significance was reached. In the later period, all incidence comparisons between study group and con-trol group were significant, with the exception of bone and soft tissue sarcomas, where no more difference is seen. This is likely due to the fact that the vast majority of these patients are seen in one large sarcoma referral center in Berlin. In total, with the exception of sarcomas, the expected recovery in the late period did not in fact take place.",

Elderly patients were obviously more affected by the reduced number of hospital admissions than younger patients, probably because their personal health risk was considered especially high. In the federal states with higher numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospital admissions were reduced to a much greater extent than in states with lower numbers. The effect of hospital volume could well be a result of smaller numbers, rather than the assumption that small hospitals were not affected. A limitation of our analysis is, that university medicine is not sufficiently represented since there is only one university hospital in the Helios network. However, recent data from 310 hospitals within the IQM network have shown a pronounced reduction in numbers at all types of hospitals, i.e., university hospitals, community hospitals, and privately owned hospitals as well as at all sizes of hospital (maximum-care and basic-care hospitals). The effect was seen not only in elective treatments, where a delay is acceptable, but also in cancer care and emergency treatments like heart attack and stroke [5] . We therefore conclude that our analysis can be regarded as representative for Germany. Reasons for the decline in hospital admissions are complex and require further investigation. Patients may have been reluctant to seek medical attention due to the fear of contagion at the hospital. In addition, the emphasis on social distancing might have inappropriately persuaded patients to avoid in-person medical care. Another reason may have been difficulty in getting appointments in outpatient care since many practices were either closed or had at least reduced their daily patient consultations.",

Obviously, the expected recovery did in fact not take place so early. The relative impact of reduced outpatient diagnoses, limited hospital resources, or patients' reservations and fears cannot yet be analyzed to explain this difference, but all of these factors together might have contributed to this significant effect. Also, the possible impact on prognosis and late outcome due to later diagnosis and treatment will only become evident in the future and should be analyzed accordingly.",
