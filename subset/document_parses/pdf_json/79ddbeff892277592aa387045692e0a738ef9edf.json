Several mathematical models can be used to analyse potential mechanisms that underline epidemiological data; generally, we can distinguish among phenomenological models that emphasize the reproducibility of empirical data without insights in the mechanisms of growth, and more insightful mechanistic models that try to incorporate such mechanisms [30] . To fit our cumulative curves, we first use the adjusted exponential model of [32] since it naturally provides an estimate of the basic reproduction number R 0 .
