            "text": "Background: The coronavirus disease pandemic has promoted changes in lifestyle behaviors, such as food consumption, sleep, and physical activity (PA). Few longitudinal studies have investigated these changes in young adults. Aim: This study aimed to assess lifestyle behaviors before and during the COVID-19 pandemic in young adult males. Methods: 50 young adult males (18-35 years) recruited by posters and social media in Florianopolis, Brazil, provided data on food consumption, PA, and sleep in 2018-2019 (baseline) and during the pandemic in 2020 (follow-up). PA and sleep variables were assessed through self-reported questionnaires. Food records were used to evaluate food consumption. Weight was measured using Bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline and using self-reported at follow-up. Multilevel linear regression models and generalized linear multilevel were used to test differences between baseline and follow-up. Results: The findings indicated significant changes at follow-up, compared to baseline. Decreased consumption of total fat (\u03b2 = \u221213.32, 95% CI (\u221222.45; \u22124.18), p < 0.01), sodium (\u03b2 = \u22121330.72, 95% CI (\u22121790.63; \u2212870.82), p < 0.01), cholesterol (\u03b2 = \u2212212.99, 95% CI (\u2212269.8; \u2212156.18), p < 0.01), total sugars (\u03b2 = \u221265.12, 95% CI (\u221280.94; \u221249.29), p < 0.01), alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverage were observed. Despite that, a slight increase in weight was also observed (80.70 \u00b1 16.37 kg vs. 82.99 \u00b1 15.42 kg, p = 0.000748). Sleep duration increased (\u03b2 = 0.7596, 95% CI (0.41; 1.11), p < 0.01), and occupational PA decreased (\u03b2 = \u22121168.1, 95% CI (\u22121422.33; \u2212913.83), p < 0.01), while domestic (\u03b2 = 394.04, 95%CI (114.68; 673.39, p < 0.01)) and leisure PA (\u03b2 = 499.91, 95% CI (245.28; 754.53), p < 0.01) increased. Conclusion: Our results suggest that social distancing policies positively impacted eating habits, sleep, and PA patterns. These changes are possibly linked to increased awareness of the need for a healthy lifestyle.",

An adequate engagement in these behaviors and a balanced diet is recommended by the World Health Organization (Bull et al., 2020) , to prevent the burden of non-communicable diseases and other adverse health outcomes. (WHO, 2010) . Since lat|e December 2019, the new disease, called coronavirus disease caused by the SARS Coronavirus-2 (Rabi et al., 2020) , spread into several countries being described as pandemic on March 2020 (WHO, 2020b). In an attempt to limit the spread of the virus, governments adopted restrictive measures for population circulation. This has limited peoples' access to several services and disrupted work routines, ultimately leading to the shift of behavioral patterns, including PA, sedentary behavior, sleep, and diet (Ammar et al., 2020; Morin et al., 2020; Reyes-Olavarr\u00eda et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) .",

Still, empirical evidence regarding diet, PA, and sleep changes as a result of the pandemic in Brazil remains mostly unexplored. On February 26 th 2020, the Brazilian Ministry of Health confirmed the first case in Brazil (CEO, 2020). In early March 2021, Brazil ranked second globally, accounting for more than 11 million cases, and had accumulated more than 287 thousand deaths (CRC, 2021) . In Brazil, actions were decentralized between its states, with social distancing and home isolation being the most prevalent preventive measure. Even though there was no lockdown, social distancing and home isolation can adversely affect several daily routines, including sleep, PA, and food patterns. Therefore, we aimed to compare lifestyle behaviors (sleep, physical activity, and food intake) between a previous moment and during the COVID-19 pandemic confinement in the young adult males. We hypothesized that the lifestyle quality worsened during social distancing compared to the pre-pandemic period.",

As a result, the PSQI provides an analysis of each of the 7 domains and an overall sleep quality score, which ranges from 0 to 21 points. In general, scores greater than 5 indicate poor sleep.

            "text": "Increased awareness of the need for a healthier food pattern, especially during the pandemic, could be one of the factors that justified the shift towards healthier food consumption. During the pandemic, the WHO, among several other organizations, has encouraged individuals to prioritize fresh products, adopt a varied and healthy diet, prepare home-cooked meals, enjoy family meals, and limit the consumption of ultra-processed foods (WHO, 2020a). Also in this context, homemade recipes and the frequency of cooking have increased during the pandemic (Deschasaux-Tanguy et al., 2020; Di Renzo et al., 2020b; Matsuo et al., 2021; Reyes-Olavarr\u00eda et al., 2020) . This behavior is associated with healthier food choices and fewer fast-food meals (Larson et al., 2006) . Our study observed an increased consumption of some food groups, such as fruits, vegetables, and legumes (40%), fat, sugar, and salt (40%), and animal protein sources (52%). These results are consistent with available literature. For example, Wang and colleagues observed that more than 30% of individuals reported an increase in the consumption of vegetables, fruits, and dairy products during the pandemic, while there was an increase of 30% in the consumption of snacks (Wang et al., 2020) . Maintaining a healthy diet during the COVID-19 pandemic time is of paramount importance to ensure the proper functioning of the body and the immune system reducing the risk of infections (Gombart et al., 2020) and influencing the inflammatory status (Minihane et al., 2015) .",

A similar result was observed in previous studies analyzing lockdown conditions (Di Renzo et al., 2020b; Wang et al., 2020) . This increase in sleep duration may be partially attributable to a decrease in time spent in other work and leisure activities that were not permitted at the time of the follow-up, such as going to bars, clubs, gyms, and other social spaces. This increase in sleep duration could be a positive change for health as maintaining adequate quality, and quantity of sleep is a protective factor for several health-related outcomes (Reutrakul and Van Cauter, 2018; Wright et al., 2015; Zimberg et al., 2012) . Future studies should address the behaviors that were displaced for sleep and monitor if the changes in sleep duration will be maintained or reversed as the pandemic progresses. Physical activity has also been observed to change from baseline to the COVID-19 follow-up. Unlike some studies, the participants in our study reported reduced occupational PA and increased leisure and domestic PA. Except for the study of Di Renzo and colleagues (Di Renzo et al., 2020b) , which found a higher frequency of training during the pandemic, most studies showed that a reduction in the PA frequency during the pandemic occurred (Ammar et al., 2020; Deschasaux-Tanguy et al., 2020; G\u00f3rnicka et al., 2020; Reyes-Olavarr\u00eda et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020) . It is not entirely clear why some studies showed an increase while others showed a decrease in time spent in PA, one possible explanation is that for some activities, the required space (e.g. clubs and gyms) might not be available for the duration of the lockdowns, as for other people, the availability of time, which was one of the main barriers for the engagement in PA (Daskapan et al., 2006) , might have increased with the decreased load of other activities. Overall, this change might be beneficial, as leisure-time PA can positively impact health, including immune function, and that can be beneficial in this pandemic (Warburton and Bredin, 2017) . In addition, the decrease in occupational PA might also benefit participants, as it has been shown to increase the risk for health outcomes, as opposed to leisure-time PA (Gupta et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Our study has some limitations. First, the sample size was small and not representative of young adults of Florian\u00f3polis, and thus, the results of this study cannot be generalized. Second, the use of non-validated or standardized questionnaires and the self-report of body mass might induce some bias. Nonetheless, this method was chosen to assure participants' safety and improve adherence. Using a web-based application to analyze food consumption during social isolation might also induce some measurement error compared to our baseline questionnaire; however, we have used a previously validated tool (Chen et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2018) . Lastly, because the baseline measurements took place before the beginning of the pandemic, we cannot assume all observed changes were caused by the quarantine period only. The strengths of our study were: (1) the inclusion of several indicators of lifestyle behaviors; (2) all data (food intake, PA, sleep, and body mass) were collected prospectively instead of retrospectively, being less susceptible to bias, and; (3) we assessed food consumption using 3 food records to minimize day-to-day variation and obtain the current consumption. Further, in both moments, we adjusted the inter-and intra-individual food consumption. It is important to highlight that adaptations were necessary for the execution of this and other studies in times of the COVID-19 pandemic (Jung et al., 2021) . In our study, we applied methodological and analytical adaptability to face the challenge of carrying out research during the pandemic and ensuring the safety of the participants. Overall, our findings suggest that lifestyle behaviors changed during the COVID-19 pandemic, and some of these changes seem beneficial to the participants. We observed a food quality improvement combined with increased leisuretime PA and sleep duration. Despite this, a slight increase in body mass and BMI were self-reported. The increment in body mass can be a result of body fat gain, lean body mass gain, or both; but this remains to be investigated. Future studies should prospectively monitor changes in these behaviors and body mass as the pandemic policies change, as well as include information on the degree of processing of food. Our conclusions are drawn to contribute to the expanding literature pool concerning lifestyle behaviors in a middle-income country under unusual circumstances. Our findings may provide valuable and timely information in developing action plans involving the quality of life of young adults during the pandemic, such as improving food quality and cooking habits and the incentive to increase PA and sleep quality.",
