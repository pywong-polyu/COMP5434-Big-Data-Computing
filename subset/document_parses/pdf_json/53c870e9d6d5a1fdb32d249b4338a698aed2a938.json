But now as the outbreak of COVID-19 has hit mankind globally, many countries are forced to implement self-quarantine, resulting in anthropogenic activities across the globe coming to a halt, especially in production/manufacturing. It has been clearly established that ever growing industrialization for the last two decades has immensely polluted the atmosphere, biosphere, and hydrosphere; also other overlooked concerns like noise pollution, soil pollution, etc., never gets adequate attention. As recently, all the activities have been seized considerably, the pollution level in the environment is expected to go down within a curtailed period. This chapter undertakes a brief and specific scenario of industrial pollution during lockdown; hence, the aim is to be focused on the dissemination of information in general, related to the current parameters regarding the status of the decreased level of industrial pollution in air, water, and soil. In the context of water pollution we have discussed the improvement of water quality in terms of change in pH, total dissolved solids (TDS), suspended particulate matter (SPM), biological oxygen demand (BOD), chemical oxygen demand (COD), heavy metal contamination in sewage as well as ground water, and biological parameters like reduction in coliforms, fecal coliforms, organic wastes, planktonic population, etc., whereas in case of air pollution it was found that there has been a sharp drop in the major air 141 142 R. S. Sharma et al. pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, O 3 , SO 2 , CO, hydrocarbons, and NO 2 as compared to the pre-lockdown phase, same consequences were also obtained in case issues related to the soil pollution. Also recent observations suggest that the ozone hole at Earth's polar regions has begun to heal. These changing statistics of pollution rate can help us in the exploration of various public and private views, which could further encourage us to adopt better pollution controlling strategies; highlighting and also examining different social, economical, and technical challenges related to industrial pollution.",

History of pandemic goes ages before industrial revolution; from every pandemic disease world majorly faced various other problems like poverty, economic crisis, health-related issues. etc. And now in this twenty-first century, with the advancement of the modern world, COVID-19 pandemic has hit very hard globally in the end of 2019 (December, 2019) [61] . Novel corona disease (COVID-19) is highly contagious that resulted due to recently evolved virus emerging from the city of Wuhan, Hubei mainland province of China [39] . The disease is caused by a novel lineage B beta coronavirus better known as SARS-CoV2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) [53] . Emerging from Wuhan, the virus took no time to spread across the globe. According to the WHO's report updated on July 23, 2020, there are 14,731,563 confirmed cases of COVID-19 while 611,284 has lost their life from 216 countries and most of the fatalities were reported in America (WHO report 2020 dated 07- . Due to the high spreading rate of this virus by the means of personal contact, respiratory droplets of infected people, privation of proper treatment and unavailability of a vaccine, several countries imposed complete lockdown to break the infectious chain, and maintain social distancing hence reducing the rate of casualties.",

Normal life of people halts around the globe since February 2020 [70] . However, other than negative aspects there are also some positive facets of this global pandemic as it has been proved by various studies that the principle factor responsible for pollution in this sphere is due to uncontrolled anthropogenic activities [56] . From the very start of industrial revolution, environmental pollution increased vigorously affecting our hydrosphere, lithosphere as well as our atmosphere and causing major health risks to humans, animals as well as to our mother Earth. Before the COVID-19 outbreak [32] the pollution levels were continuously reaching the threshold, due to ever existing issues like traffic, modern industries, new inventions, excessive chemical and pesticide uses; caused air, water, soil, as well as noise pollution. On top of that various other problems like thinning of the ozone layer to an alarming range were causing a serious disturbance in our environment. Since due to lockdown most of the anthropogenic activities have been restricted for months, it has been predicted that the pollution levels in the environment are experiencing a sharp decline [70] . Other than that, the industries are also temporarily non-functional, so for now the production is off or minimal because of which the resulting byproducts, generally in the form of effluents and emission has cut down a lot, leading to a humongous decrease in water and air pollution. Minimal traffic, lesser activities in industries or factories and also in the construction sectors have improved the air quality by a giant stride ( Fig. 6.1 ). According to the Environmental and Energy Study Institute (EESI) the aviation emissions, which globally holds for 2.4% of CO 2 emissions in 2018, have now declined considerably [50] .",

            "text": "Humans have always thrived to obtain more and more, the consequence of this never ending greed of humans continued with the setting up of various types of industries including both small as well as large-scale industries [64] . From the mid-eighteenth century to the early nineteenth century the industrial revolution has brought an extreme change in the social and economical lives of humans. The benefits of this revolution are experienced even today but with that come to the consequences as well. One thing that has followed the industrial revolution is industrial pollution. These industries prepare a variety of products from raw materials as per the increasing demand but with never ceasing greed and desire to be perfect, a large amount of load has turned on toward the environment which is now surrounded from technoecosystem. At the start only small-scale industries existed and the pollution was limited to minimum, smog being the primary pollutant. However, advancement in science and technology changed the situation and these industries got converted into large plants, spreading all across the globe, resulting in increased level of pollutants which are today a major concern globally. Industrial installation largely takes place in the areas which are closer to the urban areas and near water bodies. This makes waste management and supplies easier for the companies plus more labor at cheap cost allows the industries to work day and night. The government set up large industries to boost their economies, they have also made sure of some ground rules which do not allow malfunctioning industries to release all their waste into the surrounding environment hence, they need to take some proper measures. However, the execution of these laws is quite poor and the government is also overlooking this issue. To maintain the resilience in the society and to make sure it doesn't get vulnerable to extreme events demographic, industrial, or economic it is important to make sure that the natural balance does not get disturbed [23] . These recurring environmental problems are not just intensifying the disasters but also can make sure to lead a potential secondary disaster. Japan's Ministry of Environment has a study conducted on air pollution which suggests that acid rain during hurricanes and typhoons is the result of pollution from urban cities and industries. Environmental degradation contributes to be a key factor in turning utmost weather events into natural disasters; therefore this issue needs our foremost attention [49] . The challenge includes desertification, deforestation, pollution, and climate change. Industrial pollution being the ground cause of the major environmental issues; our sole purpose is to emphasize problems sourced from industries to obviate environmental degradation which eventually helps us counter society's vulnerability toward nature. Figure 6 .2 is describing how industrial pollution is generated.",

In around 6 days 4,000 people died and a recent study suggests that the estimate rose to the figure of around 12,000 deaths. Former USSR in 1979 had a biological warfare laboratory near Sverdlovsk which had an accidental leakage of anthrax which is believed to be a reason for nearly 64 deaths.

Industries are the source for a diverse range of pollutants which significantly is a burden to society. Usually this burden fails to get compensated because of the economic benefits and local jobs for income. The common type of pollution caused by industrial pollution is air pollution, water pollution, soil pollution, and to some extent noise pollution as well. Some other type of pollution created by industries includes radioactive pollution and thermal pollution, although their amount is quite less in comparison to the above-mentioned types of pollution. Air pollution can be given as introduction of any unwanted substance in the air with concentration more than the desirable amount is called as air pollution. There are commonly two sources of air pollution on the earth namely Anthropogenic (man-made sources) and Natural sources. The major cause of air pollution is related to the combustion of fossil fuels for example coal, diesel, etc. The primary pollutants of air pollution are CO 2 , CO, SO 2 , NO x , CFC, NH 3 , Volatile organic compounds (VOC), and Particulate matter [35] .

Industrial wastewater contains pollutants such as heavy metals, organic burden, oil, and salts which impacts widely, starting with damage to wastewater transportation system and wastewater treatment systems, ending up with even more adverse quality of released effluents which are later recovered for irrigation purpose. Concluding, industrial wastewater is significantly more negatively potent toward the environment than its corresponding share in urban wastewater.

Natural processes and human activities both could results in soil contamination hence, soil pollution. Although, soil contamination is majorly the result of human activities. The presence of chemicals like ammonia, petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, herbicides, nitrate, mercury, lead, naphthalene in excessive amount contributes in soil contamination. The improper ways of chemical waste disposal from industries also cause contamination of soil, which in the long run lead to soil acidification. It causes detrimental effects on the soil ecosystem and the environment at large. Living, working, or playing in the contaminated soil leads to skin diseases, respiratory disorders, and toxification. After rain the surface run off adds to water bodies carrying pollutants in it eventually polluting underground water as well. This water becomes unfit for human consumption as well as for animals, as attributed with toxic chemicals. As soil is an important habitat for different microbes and other animals like reptiles, mammals, birds, and insects therefore its contamination can cause a massive imbalance in soil ecosystem. The soil pollution negatively impacts the life of microflora as well as creating huge threat to grazing animals [55] .",

This caused a lot of problems in the human lives, affecting their social life, global mobility, and economy. But for the environment this lockdown for the humans came out as a boon; as the major parameters of pollution began to show improvements. This enhanced the overall air quality around the globe as the air pollution levels experienced a steep decline in an unparalleled way and provided new opportunities to study air pollution and various ways to control it when the lockdown gets lifted [65] . A healthy human life needs clean air with an adult individual breathing almost 20 m 3 of air each day. But according to the reports of WHO [69] , right now air pollution has become a substantial environmental health risk on the earth causing premature death of seven million people annually, worldwide. Number of deaths caused by air pollution stands quite less than the other causes of deaths such as diseases like tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, and also road accidents combined together. The severity of air pollution in our environment can be determined easily by the data that shows 9 out of 10 people breathe air with high levels of pollutants [69] . It is estimated that each individual dies 28 years earlier of their actual lifespan than they would do if they inhale fresh and clean air. Along with the health issues air pollution also affects our economy and is one of the potent causes in the degradation of the environment [33] . Developing countries (India and China) experience the worst effects of air pollution and also the underdeveloped countries (Bangladesh, Pakistan, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Iraq, Nepal, etc.). Around 94% of the deaths caused due to air pollution occur in countries with low and middle incomes. Besides this the South East Asia and Western Pacific regions carries maximum burden with 2.4 and 2.2 million annual deaths, respectively. In Africa the number of deaths is around 980,000 followed by the Eastern Mediterranean region and the least 38 number comes from Europe and America with 348,000 and 233,000 deaths, respectively. The remaining deaths are seen in countries with high income like Europe, America, Eastern Mediterranean, and Western Pacific ( Fig. 6. 3) [68] .",

During this period, China's major industries operation level was much lower than the normal. From last 3-5 years the production and consumption level of the energy has decreased, while this year it came up to its lowest point. The average consumption of coal reached its minimum in the last four years and the demand for oil reached the minimum since autumn 2015. In addition, demand for various other products such as petroleum products, steel, and other metals saw a sharp decline. Overall the use of crude oil and coal reduced up to its maximum levels during the lockdown phase in China. Also in correspondence to the time stretch, followed by the spring festival holidays in 2019 (within the same 2 weeks), the CO 2 emission got lowered by 25% or more. The above data explains that China has dwindled to about 1 million tons of carbon emissions, analogous to the 6% of global emissions over the same period.

The indirect source consists of contaminants that enter in water supply through groundwater systems or from the atmosphere directly through rain. Sources for groundwater contaminants are the improperly disposed industrial wastes, residues of human/agricultural practices (pesticide, fertilizers, etc.); atmospheric pollutants are also the consequence of human practices such as emission of gasses from factories, automobiles, burning of plastic products, etc. [62] . Due to worldwide lockdown, most of the industries were closed and if open they were manufactured with lower demand, which directly affects the amount of contaminated water discharged by these industries as their byproducts and this directly saves our surface water resources. About 70% of industrial effluent directly adds up to the drinking water resources in developing countries because of the lack of funds and contribution toward water pollution but due to COVID-19 outbreak, water sources have once again started to clean out effectively.",

            "text": "India is known as the land of rivers as it is blessed with the extensive network of Himalayan and peninsular rivers. Most rivers from the northern region are perennial in nature and originate from Himalayan Glaciers, while peninsular rivers are largely fed by rainwater and mainly arise from Westerns Ghats. Many ancient civilizations took birth on the laps of river banks as they provide a rich source of life and these rivers are still considered sacred in Hindu mythology as well as some other mythologies. River system in India plays an important role as it provides potable water, cheap transportation, livelihoods, electricity, irrigation water, etc. Table 6 .1 describe some major rivers in India. Due to fast growing industrialization in India, especially in the last two decades; has helped to improve the living standard of people but for that we had paid a nasty amount to nature in the form of increasing pollution. Hence, both the river water we take and the air we respire is heavily poisoned [38] . The anthropogenic activities in and around the river are continuously destroying the marine life and are responsible for the imbalance of aquatic ecosystem, also for the increase in the process of eutrophication hence, unplanned industrial setup is rapidly adding on to marine discharge and to the total amount of pollutants being disposed in the river or sea [27] . These discharges consist of heavy metal and other toxic elements which may get accumulated or biomagnified as they first get transferred into our food chain and then to the food web [1] . In this section of the chapter we will see how the water quality of major rivers in India got differently affected during social lockdown caused by the deadly virus, COVID-19.",

River pollution has become an emerging issue for various developing countries due to the fast growing industries, uncontrolled population, and management issues.

This group of bacteria makes most of the microflora of fecal matter of warm-blooded animals including humans as they add up to the major microflora of our gut.

            "text": "Lockdown has significantly changed the water quality standards of river Ganga. Mukherjee et al. [44] reported that there was a sharp decrease observed in the number of total coliforms values in the Ganges during COVID-19 lockdown period (April 2020) and this sudden drop is due to the non-functioning of industries, less traffic, and closed tourism in conjunction with the reduced waste disposal activities. According to Dutta et al. [19] river, Ganga has shown significant signs of revival and also other improvements on different parameters. This change of impact can be noticed in terms of increased dissolved oxygen (DO), reduction in numbers of total coliform especially fecal coliform, nitrate (NO 3 ) concentration, etc., this data was observed in many districts falling under the Ganga basin, during lockdown. Decline in the concentration of nitrate was observed due to limited industrial activities and limited agriculture runoff (Fig. 6.12) . A sharp reduction was observed in the nutrient load of phosphate and nitrate, confirming the constructive role of lockdown for the aquatic system of river Ganga which leads to a balanced ecosystem of the river. Lockdown also allowed aquatic life to revive and also reduced the strain from aquatic flora and fauna [58] . The pH levels of the aquatic ecosystem of river Ganga has reduced due to climate change, which results in increased dissolution of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) and caused acidification (carbonic acid formation) of water, however during lockdown there has been a uniform increase of pH confirming reversal process of acidification [18, 19] . The Yamuna is another major river of India and unfortunately is among distinctively dirtiest rivers in India. It is the second largest and longest tributary of Ganga hence the polluted water of Yamuna ultimately affects the water parameters of Ganga River. The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) had identified more than 351 polluted river sites across India in 2018 and many of these sites were situated alongside large urban cities and industrial areas [48] . Yamuna is considered as the most polluted river in the world [43] . Yamuna's water quality mainly degrades when it enters into Delhi National Capital Territory (NCT) about 23 km upstream of Wazirabad Barrage (Palla) and travels around 6.9 km downstream of Okhla Barrage, this area of about 48 km in Delhi NCT consist of only 2% of total Yamuna's path but receives almost 79% of its total pollutant load [48] . According to Kumar et al. [29] the water quality of Yamuna from the Himalayan segment up to Palla (before entering in Delhi) is moderate, whereas the Delhi segment is the worst affected area of entire river length.",

Patel et al. [48] analyzed the aftermath of lockdown on Yamuna's water at different sites in Delhi and reported that, there is an improvement in water quality of 37%, which is a huge increment. The biological oxygen demand and chemical oxygen demand were reduced by 42.83% and 39.25%, respectively, with respect to the pre-lockdown phase and fecal coliforms decreased more than 40%. During lockdown the Yamuna possesses a declined effluent load, low levels of turbidity, suspended particulate matter, and algal signatures. Arif et al. [2] said that a general improvement in the water quality of river Yamuna has been observed during lockdown, the concentrations of pH, BOD, DO, electrical conductivity (EC), and COD has showed a cut down of 1-10%, 45-90%, 51%, 33-66%, and 33-82%, respectively, in comparison to pre-lockdown state. The water quality of Yamuna has improved much better during lockdown even when several efforts and actions were taken before for cleaning the river, where also an enormous amount of money was invested but no satisfactory results were obtained until now [2] . It seems that COVID-19 lockdown has provided us with a perfect opportunity to revive all those water bodies which are on the verge of dying; not only in India but also in the entire world. Of course there are several disturbing issues related to this pandemic situation which cannot be appreciated at all but as a society we need to accept that the lockdown has taught us an important lesson that we have to care for our nature for a better and glorious tomorrow.",

Environmental noise is known as the unwanted sound that is generated by anthropogenic activities, i.e. industries, traffic, music at high volumes, commercial activities, etc. [72] . Man-made noise reduces the capability to receive natural sounds which play a crucial role in the reproduction and survival of wildlife [8] . In the past, noise pollution was considered to be a city problem but due to rapid growth and development of humans in rural areas, its reach has been extended [8] . Environmental noise is the main causal agent of health-related problems, discomfort in environment and population, and finally alters the natural conditions of this ecosystem [71] . According to Zambrano-Monserrate et al. [72] the imposition of lockdown measures by most of the governments of different countries in the world ordered people to stay at home resulting in the significantly decreased use of public and private transportation, many commercial activities, and air traffic have halted. All these changes help in dropping the level of noise considerably in various cities of the world. Mandal and Pal [41] reported that a decrease in the levels of noise was observed in the stone crushing and quarrying site situated in Dwarka, the river basin of Eastern India the noise level dropped to <65 dBA which was above 85 dBA in stone crusher dominated area during pre-lockdown period. Throughout the complete lockdown and quarantine period several drastic changes occur in the earth's atmosphere including reduction in the noise pollution, decreased emission of greenhouse gasses, reduced solid waste production, etc. [30] .",

The quarantine policies in various countries shift the consumers toward the online shopping and home delivery, hence the organic, inorganic solid wastes generated by households have increased. According to Zambrano-Monserrate et al. [72] hospitals in Wuhan are production houses of approx. 240 metric tons of medical wastes per day during COVID-19 outbreak with respect to previous average, i.e. 50 tons. Increased garbage from personal protective essentials (mask and gloves) was also reported in the USA [10] .

The over-exploitation by humans on nature and its natural resources had led the mother earth unable to breathe. At the dawn of the twenty-first-century humans started acknowledging the environmental changes and the threats caused by human's anthropogenic activities to mother Earth. After which various policies, set of rules and steps were taken by us at various levels including global level, national level, local level, and by various types of NGOs. But due to some of the other reason or may be due to our continuous exploitation of the natural resources to all these efforts were not significant to control the damage done by us. After the strike of COVID-19 pandemic emerged from China, many countries enforced lockdown as a measure to control the unrolling of infection. Many climatic data collected across the world signify the decreased level of exploitation of natural resources [47] which is the outcome of lockdown; on one hand as less adverse effect on natural habitats and on the other hand allows self-regeneration of the mother earth. Due to industrial shutdowns and cancellation of flights and other transportation, as an effect inflicted by coronavirus, the pollution level in air and water sources especially in urban areas showed self-recovering mode due to less exploitation of fossil fuels and release of industrial effluents [40] . in Wuhan and average decrease by 18.9 \u00b5g/m 3 in other 367 cities. The famous, canal city of Venice, Italy also experienced a decrease of industrial discharge into the canals which resulted in glittery water, found in March 2020. It has been reported that the major rivers in India like Ganga and Cauvery have drastically improved the purity of water. In Venice, the sea life is indulging again as the water canals have cleared up. Environmental noise is another major source of discomfort to the people and the nature causing health-related issues and affects the natural conditions of the ecosystem [71] . But due to lockdown imposed by the government, which caused less commercial activities and transportation hence resulted in considerable decrease in the level of noise pollution in most cities in the world. Also some study explored that lockdown has a heavy impact on the existing life form, specially giving wildlife a never seen freedom. It is revealed that in human dominating areas or \"rewinding\" urban areas, free movements of wildlife like peacocks, flamingo, White House, wild boar, sand dolphin have more frequent appearance. The air quality index is the major measure which indicates the changes in the health of Mother Nature. Probably, Mother Nature is trying to recover itself, when humans are not doing anything for it, which might be the greatest contribution of human toward the nature. One of the leading problem contributing to environmental toxicity is the recycling of waste, which is now the major concern of interest in most countries [37] . Recycling is an effective and useful way to drop pollution, conserve natural resources, and save energy [63] . Due to the COVI-19 pandemic, many developed and developing countries like the USA did not continue the waste recycling processes in most of their cities, to stop the spreading of infection via recycling centers. Similarly, European countries affected by this virus have also stopped their recycling of waste.",

Because of this we understood that the degradation caused by man to nature is not completely irreversible and this has been witnessed by almost everyone for the last 3-4 months. This chapter is mainly focused toward the changes that arise in nature during enforcement of lockdown. The environment has started to heal itself as industries, transport, other small factories have stopped their production, carbon emission rate has been reduced, air quality and water quality has made unpredictable improvements. The air quality index of major polluted cities, not only in India but also all across the world is now in two digits, which reflects a modestly good quality of air. Satellite images of the atmosphere also show a similar fashion of decrease in air pollution. The major rivers of India like Ganga, Yamuna, etc., are now cleaner and are supporting numerous numbers of aquatic lives. Aquatic ecosystem once again starts rejuvenating, beaches become clean and there has been a significant reduction in the level of noise pollution during the whole period of lockdown. On the other hand reduction in the sum total of solid wastes produced by different types of industries was observed but the increment in the amount of domestic and medical wastes was also observed which is considered as one indirect negative effect of lockdown. It is now clear that COVID-19 has brought fear for human beings and become a curse to mankind but for nature it has emerged as a blessing in disguise.",

These concerns should focus on both short-term and long-term goals. Less fascist policies and more eco-fascism are expected from the official domain for the society. The industries should not only focus on their products and profitability but also on the harm that they are doing to the nature. Some other suggestions which can be taken by industries, government, and by the society as a whole in order to control the degradation of the nature includes self-censoring by industries, monitoring of firms by various NGO and government agencies, applying pressure on the firms to improve and upgrade over the period of time, policies should be made by the government in order to control and assess the industries. However, the policies should be structured in such a way that when placed to implementation it is easier for the firms and public to comprehend. The carbon footprint of mankind can be reduced effectively as people have started doing work from home which came out as a better alternative. There is a further need to study that the implementation of lockdown could be an alternative for reduction of pollution and its impact on the economy.",

Himalayan ranges are now visible due to sharp drop of air pollution and settling down of air particulate matter. Brasseur and his colleague[7] revealed that the mean surface O 3 concentration got elevated by the factor of 1.5-2 after enforcement of lockdown. Various case studies revealed the reduced level of two important environmental pollutants NO 2 and CO 2 across the world, as Nitrogen dioxide emission is the chief air pollutants released from industries and automobile operation. Reports from the European Space Agency (ESA) during February 2020 the level of NO 2 emission in cities and industrial areas especially Asia and Europe is relatively decreasing than previous years, by as much as 40% and after lockdown NO 2 pollution level fell by a massive percentage of 60%. The major contribution of NO 2 emission on the environment is by China among the whole of Asia which is about over 50% of total. But due to pandemic 40% of N0 2 emission is dropped in China. In Wuhan and China, NO 2 emission is decreasing up to 22.8 \u00b5g/m 3 and 12.9 \u00b5g/m 3 , respectively. Due to decrease in combustion of petroleum and fossil fuel, which is the chief cause of carbon dioxide emissions in cities and industrial areas contributing to the dramatic change in environmental pollution level; the Mother Nature experienced for first time a reduction in global emission from past twelve years[28]. It happened due to the less transportation and industrial use of fossil fuel. Last year at the same time, it was reported there is an occurrence of 100 m tons of CO 2 emission which contributes 6% of global emissions. China, which gives major contributions to Ecotoxicity by maximum carbon emissions, observed a dramatic drop of 18% carbon dioxide emissions during the period of February and March, 2020. There was around 250 tons of reduction in carbon sources of China which is equal to annual half output value of the entire UK. In America, the major reason for CO 2 emission is because of vehicular traffic. However, the pandemic is helping to reduce the carbon sources in Europe, which is a reduction of around 390 m. It is magnificently reduced to 40%. China has been experiencing clean air due to the reduction in use of crude oil and coal burning which in turn reduced the carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission. Additionally, Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) is handled by European Union reported a decrease of PM2.5 from last February compared to the previous 3 years. According to this report a significant drop of 20-30% in PM2.5 was observed in the various parts of China, with respect to the monthly average of February 2020 (Lockdown period) and the average of February 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019. PM2.5 level dropped up to 1.4 \u00b5g/m 3",
