However, this has been insufficient as health systems need to be structurally redesigned to respond to local contexts. 5 Given the emphasis on birth planning in developing countries, it is important to understand why women deliver in locations that differ from what they intended, and what contributes to that change in plan, in order to adequately design interventions and messaging to address specific barriers that prevent women from delivering where they intended. [6] [7] [8] Health facility delivery at primary health facilities with support from referral-level facilities for complicated births has been shown to improve maternal and neonatal outcomes. 5 7 9-11 In order to better understand some of the underlying factors and determinants of access to health facilities equipped with emergency obstetrical and newborn care (EmONC) and skilled birth attendants in rural Zambia, we used data from the Zambia Chlorhexidine Application Trial (ZamCAT), a cluster randomised controlled trial that assessed whether daily 4% chlorhexidine cord cleansing was more effective than dry cord care for prevention of neonatal deaths and omphalitis (umbilical cord infection) in Southern Province. 12 The aim of this prespecified, secondary analysis was to determine the proportion of women who did not deliver where they had intended, to understand the underlying reasons for the discordance between planned and actual delivery locations; and to determine sociodemographic characteristics associated with where pregnant women intended to deliver (ie, concordance with intention and practice).",

At enrolment, a detailed questionnaire was administered which included questions on household information, birth plan and antenatal care characteristics. After the enrolment survey was completed, participants were encouraged to deliver at the nearest health facility and were given standard newborn care messages which included information about delivery location, breast feeding, cord care and danger signs of ill health in their newborn baby as per national and Ministry of Health guidelines. At a home visit 2 weeks after enrolment, all participants, irrespective of study allocation, were provided a standard clean delivery kit. A birth notification system was developed in collaboration with the community specific to each cluster to alert study team of births. 15 For both study arms, field monitors conducted routine home visits at least once during the antenatal period and four times after delivery (days 1, 4, 10 and 28 post partum). Detailed information on where the woman delivered and why was collected during the day 4 postpartum visit. Data were collected using paper forms designed in the Teleforms system (HP Cambridge, UK). Supervisors reviewed forms for illegible and missing entries and worked with the field monitors to make sure they were complete.

We also assessed the reasons women indicated for why they intended to deliver at a certain location and reasons given after actual delivery on where their actual birth location; women could choose among eight different reasons for why they chose their intended or actual delivery location. Women were allowed to choose more than one reason for why they chose their intended or actual delivery location. All statistical analyses were completed using SAS University Edition. 16 We assessed the association of sociodemographic characteristics with women delivering where they intended to deliver or elsewhere using logistic regression modelling.

            "text": "Several reasons may underlie the discrepancy between intended location and actual practice around childbirth. One potential reason could be due to women's increased concerns about safety at facilities that are poorer quality. Interestingly, 46% of women in our sample indicated safety for mother/baby as a reason for why they delivered at home even though they intended to deliver at a health facility. Unfortunately, we do not know if this was driven by fear of poor treatment at the facility or fear of transporting/moving the labouring women. In some instances, poorly functioning health systems are unable to engage women in antenatal and postnatal care to create sufficient continuity of care. 17 Some of these barriers may relate to a sense of fatalism around maternal and newborn care, and are important contributors to preventable mortality. 18 Such disparities present a major challenge to policies and programmes aiming to mitigate the burden of maternal and neonatal mortality. The large proportion of facility births in unclean, unhygienic environments, and poor postnatal care may be important contributors to why women indicate safety for mother/baby as a reason why they changed their birth plan from intending to deliver at a health facility to delivering at home.",

[19] [20] [21] Among those who intended to deliver at a health facility but instead delivered at home, 45% indicated need for skilled delivery as a reason. While this seems counterintuitive, one reason for this may be the presence of traditional birth attendants (TBAs) in the community who women regard as skilled attendants. 22 23 Although a policy change in Zambia resulted in TBAs no longer being trained and recommended that they stop conducting deliveries at home, a study on reasons for home delivery and use of TBAs in rural Zambia by Sialubanje et al found that most women had positive attitudes Open access towards TBAs and regarded them as respectful, skilled and trustworthy. 19 Moreover, most women indicated that negative attitudes toward the quality of services at the clinic as a reason for why they delivered at home. 19 Smith et al focused on behavioural drivers in labour and delivery wards in Chipata District in Eastern Province, Zambia and found that women in the wards are often subjected to disrespect and abuse. 24 Another study in rural Kenya found that although the community was aware of the risks of delivering with a TBA, many still preferred to deliver with a TBA due to their availability, accessibility and their friendly attitude. 22 In Zambia, a study by Biemba et al, which used data from the ZamCAT Study, found that TBAs often end up tending to deliveries even in health facilities due to a lack of qualified personnel. 25 As for the safety of mother and child, some women perceive delivering at the health facility as unsafe based on cultural values of elder women in the community. 26 Finally, in another study, women in Ethiopia who had low perceived susceptibility and severity were more likely to intend to deliver at home instead of at a health facility. 26 27 Among women who intended to deliver at home, distance was most often cited as a reason (37.9%), although this less often reported when women were asked why they delivered home post-delivery. Our data are similar to the 2013-2014 ZDHS which reported that 32.2% of women in Southern Province indicated distance and lack of transportation as a reason for not delivering in a health facility. Additionally, a study in Ebonyi State, Nigeria on the choice of birth place among antenatal clinic attendees in rural mission hospitals also found that distance served as a major determinant of birth place location. 28 Distance as a barrier to accessing care is not uncommon in many resource-constrained countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. 29 30 Scott et al found that women who lived in remote areas of Zambia faced persistent challenges regarding delivery location. 31 The study which included four districts in Southern Province also found women who lived far from a health facility, attended fewer antenatal visits, were multigravida and who did not use maternity waiting homes had higher odds of home delivery. 31 Maternal waiting homes have shown to increase likelihood of delivering at a health facility. [31] [32] [33] Given that most maternal waiting homes were renovated or built after 2013, our study did not collect data on how maternal waiting home influenced delivery locations for those further away from the health facility.",

Despite the multiple messages provided to the participants during the antenatal period encouraging them to deliver in health facilities, a substantial number of women were unable or opted not to deliver at a facility. The decision on where to deliver may have been made in consultation with family members or influenced by other forces which were missed in our data capture. Another limitation is that the data are 7 years old. Although our findings reflected facility-based childbirth trends around 2014, 14 facility-based childbirth in Zambia by 2018 had increased. 34 However, given the recent COVID-19 pandemic, facility-based childbirth has again decreased and our findings may be applicable. 34 35 Finally, we do not have qualitative data that could have helped explore the underlying motivations around intention and actual delivery locations.",
