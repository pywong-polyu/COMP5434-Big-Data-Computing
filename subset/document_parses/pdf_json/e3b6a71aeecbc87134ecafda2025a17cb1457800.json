Based on a social network analysis of the current and past coronaviruses research over the past two decades, Tao et al.

It was also observed that some of the countries especially hit by the current coronavirus (i.e., Italy and Iran) produced disproportionately fewer articles, suggesting a research shortage based on an overstrain of healthcare facilities and physicians, which took precedence over publishing observational studies and case reports (Chahrour, Assi, Bejjani, et al., 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 179, "end": 200, "text": "(Hook & Porter, 2020;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 201, "end": 215, "text": "Hossain, 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 216, "end": 254, "text": "Chahrour, Assi, Bejjani, et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 366, "end": 383, "text": "Tao et al.

The same study found that out of 32 countries with SARS cases, less than half did not produce a single SCI publication. A broader bibliometric study based on publications of WHO's eight emerging pathogens, which included SARS, found that international collaboration ranged from 12.1 to 86.9% (Sweileh, 2017) . The same study also found that among these topics, SARS ranked first in quantity, followed by Ebola and Crimean-Congo, suggesting a higher number of studies associated with higher case incidents.

Lee (2008) also identified covert competition for publication and patents between scientists and worries that genomic information would be withheld until intellectual property rights were secured. Besides reasons having to do with rivalry, new knowledge might be suppressed due to political or cultural factors. From the perspective of a Chinese research team, reasons having to do with \"a lack of coordination and collaboration, stifling political influence, hesitation to challenge authorities, and isolation from the rest of the world\" contributed towards a missed opportunity in sharing their major SARS findings (Enserink, 2003, para 7) .

As US leaders have referred to COVID-19 as the \"Chinese Virus\" or \"Wuhan Virus,\" Chinese leaders have suggested that the SARS-CoV2 virus was brought to Wuhan by the US Army (Crowley, Wong, & Jakes, 2020) . Australia's call, with support from the USA, UK, and France, for a probe on COVID-19's origins, has also added to diplomatic tensions with China (Mercer, 2020) . As scientists throughout the world are racing to halt the current pandemic's spread, US and UK authorities issued a joint statement warning against malicious cyber activity, including intelligence on national healthcare policy and sensitive data on COVID-19-related research (National Cyber Security Centre, 2020). More explicitly, the US Director of the National Counterintelligence and Security Center indicated that information on a possible vaccine would be a \"huge prize,\" but \"we have full expectation that China will do everything in their power to obtain any viable research that we are conducting here in the U.S.\" (Myre, 2020, para. 7) . US policymakers have also suggested that any coordination with China is \"a self-harming exercise in a zero-sum competition for global leadership\" (Hass & Doug, 2020, para 3) . The US president also threatened to permanently cut funding to the World Health Organization (WHO) because of its alleged pro-China bias (Restuccia, Lubold, & Hinshaw, 2020) . The effect of such a cut would be substantial given the USA is the world's largest sponsor to the WHO, contributing 15% of the organization's $4.8 billion budget (Togoh, 2020) . Meanwhile, the Chinese government announced that funded studies on coronaviruses are to be published in local, over international, Chinese journals (Larivi\u00e8re, Shu & Sugimoto, 2020) . This move aligned with a broader research-evaluation reform initiative that prioritizes domestic needs and ultimately publishes in domestic over SCI journals (Huang, 2020; Tao, 2020) . While most media attention related to such geopolitical tensions has involved China, strains are also occurring elsewhere. On April 2020, two prominent French doctors suggested that Africa should serve as the laboratory for vaccine testing, sparking a widespread public outcry and reminders of the continent's colonial past with Europe (Kossoff, 2020) . The following month, the USA shunned a global virtual meeting organized by Europe in raising $8 billion for vaccine research, noting that the USA is already investing billions of dollars in its own domestic efforts (Stevis-Gridneff & Jakes, 2020).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 378, "end": 408, "text": "(Crowley, Wong, & Jakes, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 556, "end": 570, "text": "(Mercer, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1197, "end": 1218, "text": "(Myre, 2020, para. 7)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1367, "end": 1394, "text": "(Hass & Doug, 2020, para 3)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1534, "end": 1570, "text": "(Restuccia, Lubold, & Hinshaw, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1735, "end": 1748, "text": "(Togoh, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1899, "end": 1932, "text": "(Larivi\u00e8re, Shu & Sugimoto, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2093, "end": 2106, "text": "(Huang, 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2107, "end": 2117, "text": "Tao, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}, {"start": 2456, "end": 2471, "text": "(Kossoff, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "COVID-19 and geopolitical tensions"}, {"text": "The conceptual framework for this study is scientific globalism, sometimes referred to as technoglobalism (Cantwell & Grimm, 2018) . According to S\u00e1 and Sabzalieva (2018) , scientific globalism's basic mission is for the advancement of knowledge and open science, which can be contrasted to scientific nationalism's focus on economic competitiveness and nation-building. Scientific nationalism, on the other hand, views scientific and technological advancement as a way to ensure national security, strengthen economic advantage, and signal national prestige (S\u00e1 & Sabzalieva, 2018) . They found that both logics coexist, despite various tensions and contradictions in policy. Cantwell and Grimm (2018) similarly propose that academic science is both a global and cooperative enterprise as well as a nationalist endeavor in competition with state rivals. In the case of China, Cantwell and Grimm suggest that the country's rise is a consequence of savvy technonationalism, whereas the USA and UK's nationalism policies, in favor of right-wing populism, have limited their scientific enterprise. Marginson (2018) further explains that China's successful \"national/global synergy\" over the past 40 years can be explained as follows, \"China's rise in science and higher education lies on one hand in the global conditions (the evolving global science system), on the other hand in the national conditions, and especially the conjunction between global and national drivers that national policy achieved\" (p. 492). In a study of co-publications between the AUS and China over the past 5 years, Lee and Haupt (2019) also found that scientific research can be both national and global pursuits as a positive sum endeavor. From a scientific nationalism view, the authors found that despite USA attempts to curb international research engagement with China, the USA benefits from China's contribution to US research productivity. From a scientific globalism lens, global science is advanced as demonstrated by the two country's increasing co-authored scientific papers, at least prior to COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 106, "end": 130, "text": "(Cantwell & Grimm, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 146, "end": 170, "text": "S\u00e1 and Sabzalieva (2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 559, "end": 582, "text": "(S\u00e1 & Sabzalieva, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 677, "end": 702, "text": "Cantwell and Grimm (2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1111, "text": "Marginson (2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1610, "text": "Lee and Haupt (2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Scientific globalism"}, {"text": "In essence, scientific globalism (as well as scientific nationalism) will endure as long as there is international collaboration in research, but the concepts are not interchangeable. Global research participation is uneven and will always be at least somewhat shaped by national, multinational, and commercial interests. Based on their social network analysis of global science, Wagner and Leydesdorff (2005) found that the global research network is self-organizing, without any central authority directing science and that national interests alone do not explain the extent of international linkages being created. That is, international collaboration networks are \"growing independently of and orthogonally to national systems of science. The national systems continue to operate, but they are affected by the emerging global system\" (p. 205). This emerging global system is largely shaped by highly resourced nations. As Peters (2006) observes, global science has long been subject to Western control and bias, making international collaborations an imperfect proxy to global science. Center-periphery country relationships are thus not always equal or mutually beneficial. International collaborations may reflect competitive national agendas or private interests and thus are not always intended towards the global public good. Likewise, domestically produced research has also benefitted global society. The scientific global system, thus, has to be understood in relation to the importance that international ties play in enabling resources to be pooled and maximally exploited in ways that national research might be limited. Smaller national scientific systems tend not to allow for high levels of specialization, making international collaboration especially vital (Iglic, Doreian, Kronegger, & Ferligoj, 2017; Engels & Ruschenburg, 2008; Luukkonen et al. 1992 ). Collaboration benefits not only low-income but also high-income countries as well but for different reasons, often having more to do with accessing specimens and data, extending global networks and audiences and research labor (Leather, Butterfield, Peachey, Silverman, & Sheriff, 2010; Cantwell & Lee, 2010) . Thus, beyond the focus on public global goods, scientific globalism reflects cross-border networks towards the goal of extending science, regardless of the social impact. International collaboration becomes a key means of achieving this goal.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 380, "end": 409, "text": "Wagner and Leydesdorff (2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 926, "end": 939, "text": "Peters (2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1777, "end": 1822, "text": "(Iglic, Doreian, Kronegger, & Ferligoj, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1850, "text": "Engels & Ruschenburg, 2008;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1851, "end": 1872, "text": "Luukkonen et al. 1992", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 2103, "end": 2162, "text": "(Leather, Butterfield, Peachey, Silverman, & Sheriff, 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2163, "end": 2184, "text": "Cantwell & Lee, 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Scientific globalism"}, {"text": "As an extension of scientific globalism, this study also considered open access. While knowledge production, in the form of research publications, is synonymous to scientific progress, accessibility to knowledge tends to be either assumed or disregarded. Lower-income countries in particular are on the scientific \"periphery\" as they have long been disadvantaged by the unaffordability of journal subscriptions, which Chan, Kirsop, and Arunachalam (2005) refer to as \"information famine\" (para. 12). Their ability to fully participate and contribute to global science becomes hindered (Salager-Meyer, 2008; Chan, Kirsop, and Arunachalam, 2005) as past research has well established that a country's economic status is highly linked to its research productivity (King; 2004; Jaffe, ter Horst, Gunn, Zambrano, & Molina, 2020) . From a global view, open-access allows for unrestricted access to scientific knowledge in the form of free online publications. Open-access is not, however, without its limitations, including authorpay models, sometimes with no quality control, giving rise to predatory publishers (Haug, 2013) . Despite such challenges, open access allows researchers in less represented parts of the world to participate in the international research community while also allowing researchers in higher-income countries to also access local research and knowledge towards the resolution of the world's major problems (Chan et al., 2005) . In fact, Kie\u0144\u0107 (2017) found that researchers from peripheral countries preferred open-access journals for promotional as well as citation advantages. The average researcher from these countries published 46% of their works in gold open-access journals, referring to an academic publication made freely available on a publisher's website without embargo, compared with 20% for the average researcher from the socalled core countries. During the current pandemic, numerous efforts to make COVID-19 research accessible went into effect. In the beginning of 2020, publishers, funders, and scientific societies signed a statement committing to data sharing and making findings immediately available to address the health crisis (Wellcome, 2020a) . Over 30 major academic publishers, including Elsevier, Wiley, Springer, Taylor and Francis, and others unlocked tens of thousands articles (Change, 2020; Wellcome, 2020a). Artificial-intelligence tools to extract specific findings and bridge fields to navigate the fast-rising number of research papers were being developed as well (Hutson, 2020) .

Past international collaborations and the number of COVID-19 cases increase the likelihood of international collaboration on a COVID-19 publication [Exp(B) = 1.04; 1.06, respectively], whereas GDP has a negative impact [Exp(B) = .95]. In essence, countries with a strong record of international collaboration have continued to collaborate on COVID-19, but this likelihood is also influenced by the extent of their cases and GDP. Whereas the number of cases increases the probability, their relative wealth would lead them to collaborate less, likely given their already large domestic output. In examination of the countries with the highest international research collaboration on COVID-19 (Austria, Belgium, Netherlands, Hong Kong, and Saudi Arabia), their GDP is a much smaller fraction compared with the larger economies of the USA, China, Japan, Germany, and the UK. When examining the effects of producing COVID-19 articles as open access, the number of COVID-19 cases again had a positive effect [Exp(B) = 1.09] and GDP had a slightly negative effect [Exp(B) = .97] (see Table 4 ). Pre-COVID-19 open-access articles did not have a significant influence.

The study also examined the degree to which the number of COVID-19 cases and economic wealth influences these patterns. Although geopolitical tensions are ongoing, the extent of scientific globalism is generally higher in times of a global crisis and on the global crisis issue. The findings support past research that research productivity increases during public health emergencies (Zhang, Zhao, Sun, et al., 2020) and that most COVID-19 research is produced within countries, with China leading in COVID-19 publications (Hook & Porter, 2020; Hossain, 2020; Chahrour, Assi, Bejjani, et al., 2020) . Further analyses showed variations by countries and that while a country's prior patterns mattered in collaborating on internationally authored publications, the extent to which the country was affected by COVID-19 increases the likelihood they would participate in international collaboration. However, in observing open-access patterns, the country's past pattern of publishing in open access prior to the pandemic had no significant bearing on publishing in open access during this particular global crisis. Similar to international collaborations, what did make a clear difference in open access was the extent to which a county was affected by COVID-19. The same analyses also showed that the higher the GDP, the lower the odds of international collaboration and open-access publishing during a global crisis. In other words countries with a higher GDP, already producing a high domestic output, which also tend to be in restricted journals, may not engage in as much scientific globalism (via international collaboration and open-access publishing) compared with their lower GDP counterparts. Countries with a high GDP have resource concentrations (i.e., funds, equipment, staffing), which are necessary to solve problems and which makes them less dependent on outside collaborators. As demonstrated by China and the USA, there is an especially high volume and global proportion of domestic output. The two countries also have high COVID-19 caseloads, indicating a lesser need to obtain data or conduct field research abroad, which also help to explain their relatively little change in international collaboration patterns. For countries with a lower GDP and predictably smaller-sized science systems, there is a greater dependency on international collaboration, particularly to mobilize resources (Iglic, Doreian, Kronegger, & Ferligoj, 2017) and on open-access outlets (Kie\u0144\u0107; . Previous research identified a positive relationship between resource concentration and researchers' collaboration propensity; scarce resources push researchers to work together (Birnholtz, 2007) . Another study found that a coauthor having special data or equipment motivated 20% of article collaborations (Melin, 2000) . In the case of COVID-19, limited available specimens during the early part of 2020 and the costs to generate and analyze the data, combined with urgency of addressing the global health crisis helps to explain the significantly increased rate of international COVID-19 research output worldwide and why the countries with higher cases were generally more inclined or sought after to collaborate. As a past study found that researchers in small countries and working in very specialized fields are more likely to collaborate internationally (Iglic, Doreian, Kronegger, & Ferligoj, 2017) , the unprecedented nature and novelty of COVID-19 may further explain the overall international collaboration increase among lower GDP countries and those with higher COVID-19 cases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 668, "end": 700, "text": "(Zhang, Zhao, Sun, et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 807, "end": 828, "text": "(Hook & Porter, 2020;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 829, "end": 843, "text": "Hossain, 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 844, "end": 882, "text": "Chahrour, Assi, Bejjani, et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2691, "end": 2736, "text": "(Iglic, Doreian, Kronegger, & Ferligoj, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2764, "end": 2771, "text": "(Kie\u0144\u0107;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2952, "end": 2969, "text": "(Birnholtz, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 3081, "end": 3094, "text": "(Melin, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 3636, "end": 3681, "text": "(Iglic, Doreian, Kronegger, & Ferligoj, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In addition to these findings, the study more broadly extends how scientific globalism is understood and opens up several future lines of research. As this study argued upfront, scientific globalism reflects cross-border networks towards the goal of extending science, regardless of the impact.

Additionally, scientific globalism should also require knowledge dissemination as a requisite to further scientific advancement given that scholarly publications are not universally accessible. Beyond the COVID-19 cases and country GDP results, the globally coordinated effort to make COVID-19 research freely and widely available likely best explains the dramatic increase in open-access publications. While there are certainly other variables that might further operationalize scientific globalism, the data for this study was limited by the small dataset given the four-month COVID-19 time period. As the new coronavirus continues to spread and research on it continues, further research based on a larger dataset could consider a broader array of country-level factors, including country-level networks, the availability of open-source data, as well as the influence of multinational organizations to promote global agendas.

The extent of global participation, however, is limited when research is conducted within a single country. Thus as our framework suggests, scientific pursuits are not either/or as both scientific globalism and scientific nationalism can coexist. What remains unknown is whether or how much more international collaboration, in particular, would have taken place if there was less geopolitical rivalry.
