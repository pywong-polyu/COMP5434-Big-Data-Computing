Public-use mortality data severely limits the ability of researchers to examine contextual factors that might explain these disparities. Using restricted-use mortality microdata, we examine the relationship between geographic location, specific causes of death, and age at death. We show that Native American women, on average, die 13 years earlier than White women; Native American men, on average, die 12 years earlier than White men. These disparities are largest in the northern Great Plains and Rocky Mountain states. The disparity in age at death is in part due to Native Americans dying from diseases at younger ages than White Americans. Native American women and men die younger and more often from homicide in counties with persistently higher White male to female ratios. Native American men also die younger and more often from homicide when White male to female ratios increase within their county over time.",

This makes it difficult to conduct detailed analysis of Marina Mileo Gorzig mmgorsuch952@stkate.edu Extended author information available on the last page of the article. the factors associated with mortality outcomes for Native Americans and assess regional variation using standard data sets. In this paper, we use restricted-use National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) data to document Native American mortality trends over time and by geography which are not often provided in public use data or reports. This data allows us to document and control for geographic variation in Native American causes of death and average age at death by genders in the USA. We include White Americans in this analysis as a illustrative comparison group. 1 These data also allow us to speak to how regional variation in local conditions impact the average age of death of Native peoples. In recent years, advocacy groups have highlighted that homicide is a disproportionately high cause of death among Native American women and girls (Lucchesi and Echo-Hawk 2018) . Native American men are also more likely to die from homicide than their non-Native counterparts. There is specific evidence that extraction industries are associated with increased violence against men; the oil boom in the Bakken region of North Dakota and Montana was associated with 30% increase in violent crimes where both the perpetrator and victims were male (Martin et al. 2019) . The local gender imbalances that result from occupational segregation in the extraction industries near tribal lands have been a proposed cause of the disproportionate violent deaths of Indigenous people (Honor the Earth 2018). Our data allow us to explore how the local, White American male to female ratio 2 is associated with the average age of death, and the proportion of deaths due to homicide, of Native peoples. Although the White male to female ratio is an imperfect proxy for the measurement of extraction industries, the male to female ratio has been shown to be directly correlated with violence. For example, see Hesketh and Xing (2006) for a summary of early literature. More recent papers that empirically establish the correlation between the male to female ratio and violence include D'Alessio and Stolzenberg (2010), Diamond-Smith and Rudolph (2018) , and La (2017) .",

            "text": "We then examine the concern that deaths for Native Americans are related to the expansion of extraction industries (for example, fossil fuels) and the corresponding influx of men to an area. We specifically analyze the relationships between the White male to female (M/F) ratios on average age at death and the proportion of deaths attributed to homicide. We use county fixed effects to compare how age at death is related to both within-county and between-county variation in the White American M/F ratio. We find that Native American men and women die at younger ages and more often from homicide in counties with higher White American M/F ratios. For women, this relationship only appears for long-term changes, whereas men die younger and more often from homicide even with short-term changes in the White M/F ratio. 2 Throughout this paper, we use the term \"male to female ratio.\" The term reflects the underlying data we use to estimate this ratio, where individuals are identified as either \"male\" or \"female.\" Because the underlying data does not collect gender and sex separately and relies on a binary outcome, the data likely reflects a combination of gender (social identity) and sex (biological traits). We therefore do not use the term \"sex ratio\" or \"gender ratio.\" This analysis contributes to the literature on disproportionately high death rates for certain racial and ethnic groups in the USA. Our work is perhaps closest to that of Espey et al. (2014) because of its temporal nature and its focus on mortality among Native peoples although we focus specifically on just American Indians and Alaska Natives. Espey et al. (2014) use US National Death Index records linked with Indian Health Service (IHS) data and focus on IHS Contract Health Service Delivery Area counties (in which less race misclassification occurs) to examine American Indian mortality relative to Whites from 1990 to 2009. The authors found that the death rate for American Indians was 46 percent higher than that of Whites. While Whites saw decreases in all-cause mortality over this time period, American Indians did not. We extend the work of Espey et al. (2014) in several ways. First, we examine whether the disparities in expected years of life are driven by differences in causes of death or the age at death for the given cause. Second, we cover a more recent time period (up to 2017), include all Native peoples, and have a more expansive geographic coverage. Finally, we examine whether age at death is correlated with local M/F imbalances.",

This data suppression practice has a unique impact on documenting and explaining deaths of Indigenous people. Local geographic information may be an important characteristic in helping us understand Native American deaths due to violence. Analysis that fails to take account of the geographical dispersion of the Native American population and the concentration of rural deaths of the Indigenous populations will fail to uncover important trends or explanatory patterns. The history of systematic genocide, furthermore, means that the population of Indigenous people is relatively small in many counties.

During the fossil fuel boom in the Bakken region, crime increased -particularly violent assaults against men. Similarly, a key concern for the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women epidemic is the role of non-Native men who attack Native American women, particularly temporary workers in extraction industries living in \"man camps\" (Honor the Earth 2018) near and around Native American homelands. These crimes are difficult to investigate or prosecute because of jurisdictional barriers; in particular, the Oliphant Supreme Court decision (1978) established that local or tribal officials did not have the jurisdiction to charge non-Indians with many offenses on reservation lands. 4 However, even outside of tribal lands, such as in border towns or other rural areas, a disproportionately high number of men may increase Native mortality. Specifically the male to female ratio (M/F) has been linked with violence more broadly (Diamond-Smith and Rudolph 2018; D'Alessio and Stolzenberg 2010; Hesketh and Xing 2006; La 2017). As a proxy for measuring exposure to transient workers in extraction industries and as an object of interest in and of itself, we construct the male to female (M/F) ratio from the intercensal county population estimates published by the U.S. Census Bureau. We use the male to female ratios for specific races (White and American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian) for 2005 to 2017 by county and year. Because the M/F ratio is based on intercensal county population estimates, this measure is more prone to error for smaller populations than larger ones.",

Given longstanding disparate access to healthcare, high rates of poverty and systemic racism, it is instructive to investigate the extent to which average ages at death differ for Native Americans relative to Whites by the cause of death. Differences in causes of death can reflect different environments -for example Native Americans dying from lung cancer could reflect higher exposure to cigarette smoke or other toxins. However, to the extent Native Americans who die from lung cancer do so, on average, three years earlier than White Americans, may reflect less access to preventative care, diagnosis and treatment.",

Columns 2 and 4 show that within counties a higher White American male to female ratio is associated with a lower age at death for Native American men (column 4) but not women (column 2). That is, the dramatic negative relationship between the White American M/F ratio and age at death for Native American women is largely between counties, rather than in response to an increase in the White American M/F ratio within the same county over time. However, for Native American men, the relationship is large and statistically significant at \u22126.7. This implies that a ten percentage point increase (less than one standard deviation) in the M/F ratio will decrease the average age at death by about 0.67 years or by about 8 months on average. In contrast, columns 4 through 6 show that a higher AIANNH M/F ratio is associated with White American women and men dying at slightly older ages. 9 These results suggest that White male to female ratios are associated with differences in average age at death for both Native American men and women, but that short run changes locally in that ratio will be associated with larger effects for men only. On the other hand, more permanent changes in the relative prevalence of White men are more likely to affect both Native women and men dramatically. This finding may speak to the discussion of missing and murdered Indigenous women and girls as well as the fact that many tribal communities are unable to prosecute \"non-Indians\" on reservations. Specifically, if Native American women are more likely to partner with White men if there is a surplus of them around for longer (i.e., fixed differences in county male to female ratios), issues of domestic violence and institutional power may be more important than if there is a short-term change in the male to female ratio.",

This age group is the relatively young, marriageable population and may be more salient when considering intimate partner violence. The first difference is that effect of the White male to female ratio for this young age group has a negative impact on the age of death for Native American women. While not statistically significant, the point estimate on the relationship between Native American women's age at death and the White male to female ratio is \u22121.855, implying that a ten percentage point increase in the White male to female ratio among young people will decrease age at death by 0.1855 years or 2.2 months. On the other hand, we find that the male to female ratio for Native Americans in this young age group does not have a large (nor statistically significant) effect on the age at death of White women. we also examine the relationship between a death being attributed to homicide and own race M/F ratios. The first four columns of Table 7 indicate that there is no relationship between either the White or Native American M/F ratio and whether the manner of death is homicide for Native American women or girls. In the next four columns, we present similar analysis for Native American men and boys. We find that higher White male to female ratio within a county over time is associated with a sizable increase in the proportion of Native American men who die by homicide. A ten percentage point increase in the White male to female ratio is associated with a 0.67 percentage point increase in the proportion of Native American men and boys whose deaths are attributed to homicide.

In Appendix Table A6 we provide regression results where the outcome of the manner of death is not specified on the death certificate for Native Americans. We do this to investigate the potential explanation that our lack of correlation being Native women and girl homicide and the male to female ratio being due to Native women and girls being more intensely affected by their causes of death not being recorded when homicide occurs as the male to female ratio increases. The \"not-specified\" designation occurs when the manner of death is simply not indicated on the death certificate. We find that increases in the White M/F ratio is strongly associated with an increases in the proportion of \"not specified\" deaths for Native American women and the correlation is stronger for Native women and girls than for Native men. This suggests that our results may underestimate the effect of the M/F ratio on homicide for Native women and girls.",

Increases in the White M/F ratios over time are associated with Native American men dying younger and more often from homicide. That is, temporary increases in the population of men appears to be associated with these two negative outcomes for Native American men's mortality. Native women and girls also seem to be affected by a higher White M/F ratio, but more clearly so when a high M/F ratio is more permanent in nature. However, short-term changes in deaths by homicide for Native women and girls may be more intensely affected by their causes of death simply never being recorded.",

On average Native Americans die 12 to 13 years earlier than Whites Americans and a significant part of this difference is attributable to Native people dying sooner from the same causes of deaths as White Americans; even if the distribution of the causes of death were the same, Native people would still die about six years earlier on average. This result is consistent with Native peoples experiencing systemically poorer care when negative health events occur and/or being more vulnerable due to historical conditions. This implies improving the availability of quality care for Native peoples when negative health events occur and reducing other economically generated vulnerabilities is a critical part of reducing differences in life expectancy.",

In addition, while elders are the essential purveyors of cultural knowledge, the loss of young lives prevents the intergenerational transmission of this knowledge that often cannot be replaced once lost.",

Out of 3,143 counties and county equivalents in the 50 states and the District of Columbia, Native American mortality rates are masked for more than 90% of all counties. This implies that research into the systemic, geographically determined factors that influence Native health are virtually impossible with public data. In order to facilitate actionable research on the factors that influence Native mortality, policy makers should consider how existing policies and procedures limit access to data. These limitations affect the ability of community members and academic allies to advocate and/or conduct meaningful evaluation on these topics. Identifying data-sharing solutions that allow for advocacy and/or research while maintaining privacy guidelines should be a priority.",

            "text": "Our final main result is that the local White malefemale ratio has implications for Native mortality. For both Native men and women, the average age of death and the proportion of deaths due to homicide are higher in areas with higher male-female ratios. This aligns with the literature documenting gender or sex imbalances associated with higher levels of violence (Hesketh and Xing 2006; D'Alessio and Stolzenberg 2010; La 2017; Diamond-Smith and Rudolph 2018) . This suggests that when policy makers are considering supporting local industries that create imbalances in the population of men and women, they should account for the potential costs associated including increased violence against Native people. For example, fracking is generally associated with gender imbalances and much of the extant literature focuses on the benefits of fracking industries; positive impacts of fracking and related industries include those on earnings, fertility rates, and wages of migrants (Kearney and Wilson 2018; Wilson 2020) and reductions in crime (Street 2018) . However, these benefits appear to be concentrated among migrants to the locations examined (Gittings and Roach 2020) who are disproportionately White and male. Even studies that uncover adverse impacts of fracking and related industries on such health outcomes as sexually transmitted diseases do not isolate these impacts by Indigenous status (Komarek and Cseh 2017) . Our results generally suggest that industries associated with gender imbalances have important costs that are not evenly distributed across communities and that also need to be considered in policy decisions.",

While this research has focused on age at death and systematic and persistent differences between Natives and Whites, it is important to highlight that this research does not affirm the myth of differences in mortality being due solely to biological causes, dysfunctional behaviors, or cultural deficits. Rather it points to the systemic factors that may influence the life expectancy of Native Americans. We should also point out that the nature of the statistical analysis generalizes a very diverse set of experiences of tribal communities. Future work should continue to carefully consider the structural and systemic forces that reduce the life expectancy of Native Americans and take lessons from that Tribal Nations who have successfully evaded the average statistics.",
