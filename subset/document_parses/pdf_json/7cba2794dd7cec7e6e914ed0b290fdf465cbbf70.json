Yet ICV remains under recognized, with most previous studies using only culture to identify cases. Objectives: To develop a sensitive and specific real-time RT-PCR assay for ICV that allows for rapid and accurate detection in a clinical or research setting. Study design: Multiple ICV sequences obtained from GenBank were analyzed, including 141 hemagglutininesterase (HE), 106 matrix (M), and 97 nucleoprotein (NP) sequences. Primers and probes were designed based on conserved regions. Multiple primer-probe sets were tested against multiple ICV strains. Results: The ICV M and NP genes offered the most conserved sequence regions. Primers and probes based on newer sequence data offered enhanced detection of ICV, especially for low titer specimens. An NP-targeted assay yielded the best performance and was capable of detecting 10-100 RNA copies per reaction. The NP assay detected multiple clinical isolates of ICV collected in a field epidemiology study conducted in Peru.

However, we included one assay that has been used in studies of ICV epidemiology as a comparator. All assays performed well, though with sequence-based modifications the performance on the NP4 assay was enhanced. Validation with specific instruments and kits is necessary for all molecular assays, and additional assessments of the assays in other settings would be helpful. Finally, ICV was frequently associated with detection of other respiratory viruses during ARI episodes. Clarifying the role of ICV as a causative agent of those illnesses is difficult and additional research is needed on this topic.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In summary, we developed a new and accurate ICV real-time RT-PCR assay based on comparison of multiple ICV gene sequences. The assay exhibited linear performance, detected viruses from diverse lineages over time, and enhanced detection of ICV in clinical specimens. We demonstrated ICV infections among young Peruvian children with ARI. These ICV infections were infrequently associated with lower respiratory tract illness in this household-based surveillance study. This new assay should be useful for future epidemiologic studies in diverse populations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "JVW serves on the Scientific Advisory Board of Quidel and an Independent Data Monitoring Committee for GlaxoSmithKline.
