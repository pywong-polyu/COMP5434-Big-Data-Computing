This study analyzes mobility pattern changes in Seoul, South Korea that adopted adaptive approach toward mobility. Intervention analyses reveal that major mobility reduction did occur two weeks before the city's case peak. Such voluntary adjustments exhibit strong preference shift toward private mode from public transit. Large reductions occurred in non-essential and high-contact activities of shopping and dining, while work and Starbucks trips were less affected. The collective evaluation reveal that major changes in epidemiology, mobility and policy occurred simultaneously, with no lagging nor leading contributors. Our study demonstrates that collective understanding the mutual aspects among mobility, epidemiology and policy is essential. Incremental and flexible mobility restriction is not only possible but necessary, especially for a pandemic of extensive spatial and temporal scales.",

In fact, the vast spatial and temporal scales of COVID-19 have revealed that the effectiveness of mobility restriction is highly dependent on timings and approaches [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Globally, two success cases of Taiwan and New Zealand had opted the early border closure 6, 7 , over which the government have a complete control. Once having missed the opportunity to lock down the national borders in the earliest stage, the actual experiences of mobility restriction have been far from seamless and vary greatly across the countries and regions [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] .",

Data ( ) is decomposed into m+1 segments of constant intercept values ( 0 ) given the linear model = 0 + . Intervention timings are the m points which is the last data point before the intercept transitions from one to another. Summary of data (Table S1 ) and the intervention estimation results (Table S2 ) are provided in the supplementary materials. Table S2 . In trip mode, the intervention days of largest reductions were detected at 21:00 on day 33 in traffic volume and 08:00 on day 34 in subway. Considering the late hour of transition in traffic volume, it is reasonable to conclude that both modes share the common major intervention day of 34, which is Saturday. However, they differ significantly in magnitude. The public mode of subway shows over 40% reduction, whereas the private mode of traffic volume shows less than 15%. The difference is even greater during the afternoon hours, showing nearly 50% reduction in subway compared to less than 10% in traffic volume. Also, reductions in subway ridership experienced its first shift as early as day 16 . Such findings manifest the strong shift in mobility preference to the private mode of choice.",

In other words, South Korea had had about two weeks to observe, learn and prepare for the virus before it reached the most vulnerable areas of highest populations. The escalation (~ day 29) and de-escalation (day 80~) phases are identified, and the geospatial peak phase is between day 30 and day 79.

Assuming psychology plays a major role, a dramatic increase in the COVID-19-related search term frequencies on day 33 may provide some clues. It is most likely that such increase is strongly related to the fact that the national toll had reached 100 new cases for the first time on day 33. Incorporating the geospatial peak period starting as early as day 30 in Seoul, it might have been not just the simple count of 100, but also the city's heightened perception of the virus finally reaching their neighborhoods in scale.

Our findings also shed some lights on the possibility and necessity of adaptive mobility restriction in future epidemics. Mobility should be viewed and adapted as the integral part of the crisis, rather than a simple and immediate option to call and wait to see what happens. If we need to live with the virus in the present and possibly in the future, it is necessary to adopt a holistic approach toward the multi-faceted nature of pandemic.",

Soohwan Oh and Jungwoo Cho collected, processed and cross-checked the subway, POI and NAVER search data, and organized refences. Seyun Kim collected and processed the traffic volume data. Yuyol Shin collected contact tracing data and calculated the grouped and Hausdorff distance. Namwoo Kim visualized the POI locations for the figure in the supplementary information. Haechan Cho collected and crosschecked the COVID-19 data. All authors discussed the results and participated in reviewing and editing the manuscript.",
