In the USA, an estimated 1.7 million HAIs occur each year contributing to the death of almost 100,000 patients, and HAIs have emerged to become the fourth leading cause of death in the USA and kill more people each year than AIDS, breast cancer and auto accidents combined [6, 7] . Approximately 5-10% of hospitalized patients in the developed world acquire such infections [8] . The rates of HAIs is much higher in underdeveloped countries [8] . A great majority of these infections are preventable. Proper use of hand hygiene is critical to the prevention of many of these infections [8] . However, compliance among HCWs is poor; usually below 40% [8, 9] . Regardless of the country where dental care is rendered, the dentist has the moral, legal, and ethical responsibility to practice dentistry in as safe a manner as possible.",

Surfaces have been shown to play a significant role in the acquisition, persistence, and spread of infections. Clinically important microorganisms that can cause HAIs have been shown to persist in the environment for considerable periods of time [11] . This facilitates the spread of the organism throughout a health-care (dental) facility, especially when compliance with hand hygiene is poor. Contaminated hands have been shown to be the vector for the contamination of viruses to multiple surfaces or patients and can also be the source of recontaminating the surface that has been previously disinfected [11] . Across the globe, evidence documents low compliance with hand hygiene making the risk from contaminated surfaces a significant factor in disease transmission in medical and dental facilities. Figure 15. 1 clearly illustrates how a contaminated surface with low hand hygiene compliance can put a patient a risk for the transmission of pathogenic viruses, bacteria, fungi, and other microorganisms [11] . Proper cleaning and disinfection of surfaces is essential to prevent the contamination and spread of infectious organisms in all dental settings.",

Blood-borne viruses (HBV or HIV) can persist for more than 1 week [11] . Herpes viruses such as CMV or HSV type 1 and 2, commonly encountered in the dental office, persist on surfaces for a few hours up to 7 days [11] . However, viruses from the gastrointestinal tract (astrovirus, HAV, poliovirus, and rotavirus) can persist for approximately 2 months [11] . Bacteria can persist for much longer periods of time. Most Gram-positive bacteria can survive for months on dry surfaces and many Gram-negative species can also survive for weeks to months [11] . ",

In order to prevent the transmission of infectious disease in the dental office, infection control recommendations have been formulated. While there is no universal global guideline, most countries as explained in the eleven chapters in this publication have clear-cut guidelines that dentists can follow to prevent the spread of infectious diseases during the delivery of dental care. It is the hope of all of the authors of this publication that their contributions can help the dental practitioners around the globe to understand the importance of infection control in the dental office and incorporate the principles of infection control/disease prevention presented in Chaps. 1-14 into their dental practices.",
