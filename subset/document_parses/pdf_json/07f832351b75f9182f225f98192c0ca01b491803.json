            "text": "Based on Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) and Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA), a novel hybrid optimization algorithm, named Hybrid Slime Mould Salp Swarm Algorithm (HSMSSA), is proposed to solve constrained engineering problems. SSA can obtain good results in solving some optimization problems. However, it is easy to suffer from local minima and lower density of population. SMA specializes in global exploration and good robustness, but its convergence rate is too slow to find satisfactory solutions efficiently. us, in this paper, considering the characteristics and advantages of both the above optimization algorithms, SMA is integrated into the leader position updating equations of SSA, which can share helpful information so that the proposed algorithm can utilize these two algorithms' advantages to enhance global optimization performance. Furthermore, Levy flight is utilized to enhance the exploration ability. It is worth noting that a novel strategy called mutation opposition-based learning is proposed to enhance the performance of the hybrid optimization algorithm on premature convergence avoidance, balance between exploration and exploitation phases, and finding satisfactory global optimum. To evaluate the efficiency of the proposed algorithm, HSMSSA is applied to 23 different benchmark functions of the unimodal and multimodal types. Additionally, five classical constrained engineering problems are utilized to evaluate the proposed technique's practicable abilities. e simulation results show that the HSMSSA method is more competitive and presents more engineering effectiveness for real-world constrained problems than SMA, SSA, and other comparative algorithms. In the end, we also provide some potential areas for future studies such as feature selection and multilevel threshold image segmentation.",

            "text": "Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA) [27] is a swarm-based algorithm proposed in 2017. SSA is inspired by swarm behavior, navigation, and foraging of salps in the ocean. Since SSA has fewer parameters and is easier to be realized in a program than other algorithms, SSA has been applied to many optimization problems, such as feature selection, image segmentation, and constrained engineering problems. However, like other metaheuristic algorithms, SSA may be easy to trap into local minima and lower population density. erefore, many improved researches have been proposed to enhance the performance of SSA in many fields. Tubishat et al. [28] presented a Dynamic SSA (DSSA), which shows better accuracy than SSA in feature selection. Salgotra et al. [29] proposed a self-adaptive SSA to enhance exploitation ability and convergence speed. Neggaz et al. [30] proposed an improved leader in SSA using Sine Cosine Algorithm and disrupt operator for feature selection. Jia and Lang [31] presented an enhanced SSA with a crossover scheme and Levy flight to improve the movement patterns of salp leaders and followers. ere are also other attempts on the hybrid algorithm of SSA. Saafan and El-gendy [32] proposed a hybrid improved Whale Optimization Salp Swarm Algorithm (IWOSSA). e IWOSSA achieves a better balance between exploration and exploitation phases and avoids premature convergence effectively. Singh et al. [33] developed a hybrid SSA with PSO, which integrated the advantages of SSA and PSO to eliminate trapping in local optima and unbalanced exploitation. Abadi et al. [34] proposed a hybrid approach by combining SSA with GA, which could obtain good results in solving some optimization problems.",

            "text": "is algorithm simulates the oscillation mode and the foraging of Slime Mould in nature. SMA has a unique search mode, which keeps the algorithm from falling into local optima, and has superior global exploration capability. e approach has been applied in real-world optimization problems like feature selection [36] , parameters optimization of the fuzzy system [37] , multilevel threshold image segmentation [38] , control scheme [39] , and parallel connected multistacks fuel cells [40] . erefore, based on the capabilities of both above algorithms, we try to do a hybrid operation to improve the performance of SMA or SSA and then propose a new hybrid optimization algorithm (HSMSSA) to speed up the convergence rate and enhance the overall optimization performance. e specific method is that we integrate SMA as the leader role into SSA and retain the exploitation phase of SSA. At the same time, inspired by the significant performance of opposition-based learning and quasioppositionbased learning, we propose a new strategy named mutation opposition-based learning (MOBL), which switches the algorithm between opposition-based learning and quasiopposition-based learning through a mutation rate to increase the diversity of the population and speed up the convergence rate. In addition, Levy flight is utilized to improve SMA's exploration capability and balance the exploration and exploitation phases of the algorithm. e proposed HSMSSA algorithm can improve both the exploration and exploitation abilities. e proposed HSMSSA is tested on 23 different benchmark functions and compared with other optimization algorithms. Furthermore, five constrained engineering problems are also utilized to evaluate HSMSSA's capability on real-world optimization problems. e experimental results illustrate that the HSMSSA possesses the superior capability to search the global minimum and achieve less cost engineering design results than other state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms. e remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief overview of SSA, SMA, Levy flight, and mutation opposition-based learning strategy. Section 3 describes the proposed hybrid algorithm in detail. In Section 4, the details of benchmark functions, parameter settings of the selected algorithms, simulation experiments, and results analysis are introduced. Conclusions and prospects are given in Section 5.",

Similarly, it can be noticed that the average fitness oscillates in the early iterations and then decreases abruptly and begins to level off. e average fitness maps also show the significant improvement of the first random population and the final global optimal, accurate approximation acquisition. At last, the convergence curves reveal the best fitness value found by search agents after each iteration. By observing this, the HSMSSA shows breakneck convergence speed.",

At the same time, two strategies, including Levy flight and mutation opposition-based learning, are incorporated to enhance the capabilities of exploration and exploitation of HSMSSA. e 23 standard benchmark functions are utilized to evaluate this algorithm for analyzing its exploration, exploitation, and local optima avoidance capabilities. e experimental results show competitive advantages compared to other state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms, proving that HSMSSA has better performance than others. Five engineering design problems are solved as well to verify the superiority of the algorithm further, and the results are also very competitive with other metaheuristic algorithms. e proposed HSMSSA can produce very effective results for complex benchmark functions and constrained engineering problems. In the future, HSMSSA can be applied to real-world optimization problems such as multiobjective problems, feature selection, multithresholding image segmentation, convolution neural network, or any problem that belongs to NP-complete or NP-hard problems.",

Finally, we utilize mutation opposition-based learning to keep the algorithm from falling into local optima; thus, the computational complexities of position updating of HSMSSA are O(2 \u00d7 N \u00d7 D). erefore, the total computational complexity of the proposed HSMSSA algorithm is O(N \u00d7 D + N + 2 \u00d7 N \u00d7 D).",
