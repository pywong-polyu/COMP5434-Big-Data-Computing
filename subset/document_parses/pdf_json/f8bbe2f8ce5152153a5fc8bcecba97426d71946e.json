However, the molecular mechanism of Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) in preventing ALI has not been identified, so we investigated whether L. casei pretreatment could inhibit the activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-jB signaling pathway following ALI. ALI model was established by intraperitoneal injection of 2 mg/kg lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to female BALB/c mice. In L. casei LC2W group, mice were intragastrically administrated L. casei LC2W for a week, before the ALI modeling. The serum of normal BALB/c mice after intragastric administration of L. casei LC2W was used for in vitro cell assays. The serum was pre-incubated with mouse macrophage cell line (RAW264.7) and human lung cell line (HLF-A), then LPS was added to co-incubate. Compared with ALI model group, L. casei LC2W pretreatment significantly reduced lung pathological damage, the number of neutrophils and total cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. Besides, L. casei LC2W pretreatment could significantly reverse the abnormal expression of ICAM-1, IL-6, TNF-a and IL-10 in lung tissue and serum, plus, L. casei LC2W significantly reduced the phosphorylation levels of IRAK-1 and NF-jB p65. In vitro, the serum decreased the up-regulation of IL-6 and TNF-a in cell lines induced by LPS. In conclusion, L. casei LC2W intragastric administration pretreatment could significantly improve LPS-induced ALI in mice, probably through circulation to reach the lungs so as to inhibit the inflammatory response induced by activation of TLR4/MyD88/NF-jB signaling pathway.",

            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is the alveolar and pulmonary capillary injury caused by hemorrhagic shock, trauma, bacterial virus infection and other factors, resulting in diffuse pulmonary edema. The clinical manifestations are progressive hypoxemia and respiratory insufficiency along with uncontrolled inflammatory response. If ALI is not actively controlled, it is easy to develop into acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and the mortality rate can reach more than 40% [1] . The initiation and activation of a large number of inflammatory factors are involved in the occurrence and development of ALI, which leads to a series of inflammatory cascade reactions [2] . It can be seen that it is necessary to curb the uncontrolled inflammatory response in the lung induced by ALI in its prevention and treatment measures, and the immune system plays an extremely important role in the inflammatory response. However, there is still a lack of effective methods to inhibit inflammatory response, mainly via controlling the primary disease and respiratory support treatment to help recover.",

For example, Lactobacillus reuteri down-regulated the expression of pro-inflammatory factors such as TNF-a and IL-6 in blood and lung tissues of ALI mice, and inhibited apoptosis, posing immune-regulatory effects on ALI [6] . Lactobacillus rhamnosus reduced the number of inflammatory cells in the respiratory tract of asthmatic mice, and the level of IL-1b in lung tissue, along with restored the homeostasis of intestinal flora [7] . Lactobacillus plantarum inhibited the number of inflammatory cells in lung and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of Klebsiella pneumoniae model mice, and down-regulated the expression of proinflammatory factors [8] . A double-blind placebo-controlled clinical study showed that Lactobacillus casei (L. casei) could reduce the incidence of pneumonia in patients with single rib fracture and improve lung function [9] .",

Mice were fed with standard mouse food and pure water, without restriction of diet. After adapting to the environment for one week, the mice were randomly divided into four groups with 10 mice in each group, namely, the normal group, ALI model group (lipopolysaccharide, LPS), dexamethasone positive control group (DEX ? LPS) and Lactobacillus experimental group (L. casei ? LPS), in accordance with random number table. The same group was housed in the same cage, and each mouse was randomly selected when intragastrically administered. The L. casei ? LPS group was given 0.1 mL of L. casei LC2W (10 9 CFU/mL to ensure the final live bacteria dose at intestine reaching C 10 6 CFU/mL) to each mouse daily for one week. The other groups were treated with equal volume of normal saline as control. The positive DEX ? LPS control group was given dexamethasone 2 mg/kg by intraperitoneal injection 24 h before modeling. In reference to a previous report [10] , for the LPS model group, the positive DEX ? LPS control group and the L. casei ? LPS experimental group, LPS (2 mg/kg of each mouce, Escherichia coli 055:B5, purchased from Sigma Corporation) was dissolved in 100 lL of normal saline, thereafter injected intraperitoneally to construct ALI model, and the normal group was injected with the same volume (100 lL) of normal saline. After 24 h, mice were euthanized with anhydrous ether, then blood was collected via retro-orbital route and lungs were removed together. The following assays were performed in a blinded manner.

The values were expressed as mean \u00b1 SD, and experiments were repeated 3 times. ?P \\ 0.05, ??P \\ 0.01, ???P \\ 0.001 are activated, then rapidly accumulate, adhere and migrate, stimulating the final release of inflammatory mediators and oxygen free radicals, ultimately aggravating the process of lung injury [18] . The L. casei LC2W screened in this study could significantly reduce the wet/dry weight ratio of lung tissue in mice with ALI, and decrease the number of white cells in BALF, presenting a good protective effect on ALI.",

            "text": "LPS used for modeling is a component of the outer part of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria, which can induce the body to produce a large number of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumor necrosis factor TNF-a, leading to severe pneumonia. It is widely used to make ALI models [19, 20] . Toll-like receptors (TLRs) are one of the cell transmembrane receptors and pathogen pattern recognition receptors in the innate immune system. Studies have shown that TLRs play a bridge role in initiating the early inflammatory response and connecting the acquired immunity in ALI, thus participating the occurrence and development of ALI [21] . TLR4 is the most important receptor that mediates LPS response [22] . Researchers generally believe that TLR4 is an indispensable transmembrane transduction receptor that transduces LPS signals from extracellular to intracellular [23] . Other than activating innate immunity, TLR4 also induces ALI through inflammatory signaling pathways such as nuclear factor jB (NF-jB). After TLR4 activation, NF-jB can be phosphorylated through myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88)-dependent signaling pathway, inducing and aggravating inflammatory response [24] . MyD88 is an important junction protein for TLR4 to transmit signals, and is one of the downstream signal proteins of TLR4 signaling pathway. The death domain of MyD88 binds to the death domain of interleukin receptorrelated kinase (IRAK), resulting in the phosphorylation of IRAK itself, resulting in the activation of NF-jB [25] . The activation of NF-jB is involved in many processes such as inflammatory response, oxidative stress and apoptosis [26] . After activation of NF-jB, NF-jB-p65 was transferred from cytoplasm to nucleus, resulting in increased transcription of NF-jB-p65, then expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-6 and TNF-a were upregulated, initiating releases of inflammatory factors, which directly led to lung injury [27] . We can see that TLR4/MyD88/NF-jB signaling pathway plays an important role in the progression of ALI. Patients with severe ALI will have progressive hypoxemia, and hypercapnia may occur after mechanical ventilation. Moreover, the coexistence of hypoxemia and hypercapnia will lead to the destruction of blood-brain barrier, which may be related to IRAK-1 and p-IRAK-1-mediated signaling pathways [28] . Therefore, how to effectively alleviate the inflammatory cascade induced by TLR4/MyD88/NF-jB signaling pathway is the focus of treatment [29] .",

Previous animal experiments and clinical studies have shown that Lactobacillus has certain effects in preventing and controlling pneumonia [6] [7] [8] [9] 30] . However, it has not been reported to explore the molecular mechanism of Lactobacillus by inhibiting TLR4-induced MyD88-dependent pathway and reducing IRAK phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting NF-jB signaling pathway and ultimately reducing inflammation. In this study, we intragastrically administered L. casei LC2W, and found that TLR4 and MyD88 in ALI mice had no significant difference (data were not listed), but the phosphorylation of IRAK began to change. The expressions of p-IRAK-1, NF-jB-p65 and p-NF-jB-p65 were significantly inhibited, and the expressions of IL-6, TNF-a and ICAM-1 in lung tissue and serum were significantly decreased. IL-10 is a cytokine necessary to eliminate bacteria and prevent lung tissue damage [31] . After intragastric administration of L. casei LC2W, the expression of IL-10 protein in lung tissue and serum of ALI mice was significantly increased, and the enhancement effect was stronger than that of dexamethasone positive control group, indicating that L. casei LC2W pretreatment effectively alleviated systemic and local immune responses induced by ALI.",

IL-6 is a cytokine with a variety of immune regulatory functions, which can stimulate the proliferation of B cells, T cells and stem cells, promote the production of immunoglobulin through B cells, and is conducive to the differentiation of cytotoxic lymphocytes and stem cells [32] . TNF-a plays an important role in cell injury and dysfunction, and the level of TNF-a is positively related with the degree of cell injury [33] . Probiotics can effectively strengthen innate and acquired immune system, playing a role in protecting the body. The immune system is essential in the process of anti-inflammatory action. We used the serum of L. casei LC2W mice to pre-incubate RAW264.7 macrophages, and then stimulated them with LPS. It was found that the levels of IL-6 and TNF-a that were highly expressed in RAW264.7 macrophages induced by LPS were significantly down-regulated. We speculated that after L. casei LC2W was intragastrically administered, it might interact with intestinal epithelial cells to produce related substances, and act on the lungs through circulation, which might involve the intestinal-pulmonary axis, and ultimately improve the immune function of mice. The related substances in the serum of mice could inhibit LPSinduced inflammatory response. Studies have shown that L. reuteri FLRE5K1 can stimulate the internal system to produce anti-cancer cytokines after intragastric administration to mice, on top of that, mouse serum inhibited melanoma cells B16-F10 [34] , which is similar to our results. In addition, the mouse serum after intragastric administration of Lactobacillus also had an effect on human lung cell lines, suggesting that Lactobacillus might prevent human ALI, possessing a good clinical transformation vision.",
