Thanks to the advances in sequencing technology, tens of thousands of RNA modification sites can be identified in a typical high-throughput experiment; however, it remains a major challenge to decipher the functional relevance of these sites, such as, affecting alternative splicing, regulation circuit in essential biological processes or association to diseases. As the focus of RNA epigenetics gradually shifts from site discovery to functional studies, we review here recent progress in functional annotation and prediction of RNA modification sites from a bioinformatics perspective. The review covers na\u00efve annotation with associated biological events, e.g., single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), RNA binding protein (RBP) and alternative splicing, prediction of key sites and their regulatory functions, inference of disease association, and mining the diagnosis and prognosis value of RNA modification regulators. We further discussed the limitations of existing approaches and some future perspectives.",

            "text": "including its degradation [1, 2] , protein translation [3, 4] and alternative splicing [5, 6] . More than 170 kinds of RNA modifications [7] have been identified on mRNA, tRNAs, rRNAs, lncRNAs and other noncoding RNAs [8, 9] , and most of them are methylation modifications. The functional significance of RNA modifications was not fully aware of until the discovery of human fat mass gene FTO as an m 6 A demethylase [10] and the invention of transcriptome-wide m 6 A profiling technology, MeRIP-seq (or m 6 A-seq) [11, 12] , which identified m 6 A in more than 25% human mRNA and indicates the influence of m 6 A in gene expression. Since then, the study of whole transcriptome RNA modifications became blooming and known as the 'epitranscriptome' [13] . Thanks to the advances of high-throughput techniques, whole-transcriptomewide maps of at least 12 modifications were profiled, including N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A), Pseudouridine (w), N 4 -acetylcytidine (ac 4 C), N 1 -methyladenosine (m 1 A), N 7 -methylguanosine (m 7 G), 2 0 O-methylations (Cm, Am, Gm, Um), 5-methylcytidine (m 5 C), 5hydroxymethylcytidine Cytidine (hm 5 C) and Inosine (I) [8, 9] . N 6 -methyladenosine (m 6 A) is the most abundant and the most well studied chemical modification on eukaryotic mRNA [14] , which has been known to play important roles in gene expression regulation [15] and translation mediation [3, 16] . The dynamic RNA m 6 A methylation can be added by m 6 A methyltransferases (writers), removed by demethylases (erasers) and recognized by corresponding RNA binding proteins (readers) [17] . The methyltransferase compound mainly consists of METTL3, METTL14 and WTAP, as well as later discovered regulatory components KIAA1429, RBM15 and RBM15B; the demethylases mainly include FTO [18] and ALKBH5 [19] . The reader protein complexes, which can specifically recognize m 6 A, mainly include YTH family proteins (YTHDF1-3, YTHDC1) , transcription initiation complex eIF3 [3] , ribonucleoprotein HNRNPA2B1 [20] and HNRNPC [21] . The dynamic m 6 A modification mediated by these regulators has been shown to play significant roles in many vital biological processes, e.g., embryonic development [22] , stem cell differentiation [23] [24] [25] , cell death and cell proliferation [26] , circadian clock cycle [27] and viral life cycle [28, 29] . The m 6 A perturbations also contribute to pathogenesis of cancers [26, [30] [31] [32] , viral infection [33] and other human diseases [34] [35] [36] . Besides m 6 A, 5-methylcytosine (m 5 C) is another wide spread RNA modification, which is primarily mediated by RNA methyltransferase DNMT2 and NSUN2 along with its homologs [37] [38] [39] and its reader proteins YBX1 [40] and ALYREF [39] . m 5 C can influence mRNA stability [40, 41] and regulate viral gene expression [6] . Adenosine-inosine (A-to-I) RNA editing, as the main form of RNA editing in mammals [42] , is mediated by the members of the adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR) enzyme family. A-to-I RNA editing plays key role in innate immunity [43, 44] and contributes to the pathogenesis of some diseases, including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) [45] and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [46] . N 7 -methylguanosine (m 7 G) is the most ubiquitous RNA cap modification [47] , which also plays significant roles in RNA metabolism including transcription, mRNA splicing and translation [48] [49] [50] . We briefly summarized here some well-studied modifications. Please refer to recent reviews [8, 9] for more comprehensive background of RNA modifications.",

Then, there exist two paths to annotate the functions of RNA modification sites: 1) The na\u00efve idea is to annotate the associated functional event according to their proximity to the RNA modification sites on the genome, e.g., miRNA target sites located within 100 bp of the RNA modification sites, which may be potentially mediated by the modification (see Fig. 1A ). 2) The more sophisticated annotation approach is to identify key sites and genes based on the functional annotations and the interactions of the genes modified at RNA level, and then further predict RNA modification-mediated functional circuits and associated diseases using complex network theories (see Fig. 1B ). Moreover, for the most prevalent RNA methylation, some studies have predicted the diagnosis-and prognosis-related methylation regulators, which start from genetic mutations and expression dysregulation of m 6 A regulators in cancers via integrated analysis and predict the potential diagnostic and prognostic methylation markers via survival and clinical analysis (see Fig. 1C ).",

            "text": "MeRIP-Seq (or m 6 A-seq) [11, 85] is the first and the most widely adopted approach for profiling transcriptome-wide distribution of m 6 A methylation. With MeRIP-seq, the m 6 A sites can be identified in a process called ''peak calling\", in which the regions enriched with m 6 A signals (shown as peaks in tag density) are identified by comparing to the input control samples. A number of peak calling tools have been developed for this analysis. MACS [86] has been a popular peak calling tool for ChIP-Seq data and is also applied to analyze MeRIP-Seq data [87] . However, MACS was developed for DNA-Seq, which failed to address some intrinsic properties of MeRIP-Seq, such as, the impact of differential RNA expression, alternative splicing [88] . exomePeak is another popular peak calling tools designed specifically for epitranscriptome peak calling of MeRIP-Seq data [89] . exomePeak supports both site detection and differential methylation analysis, but it doesn't model the variance among biological replicates. MeTPeak [90] captures the variances by introducing a hierarchical layer of Beta variables and characterizes the reads dependency across a site using a Hidden Markov model. MACS2, exomePeak and MeTPeak have been widely used to detect m 6 A peaks from MeRIP-seq data. Developing for DNA-Seq data, MACS2 can detect peaks located in intron and none gene region, while it failed to address some intrinsic properties of MeRIP-Seq data. exomePeak and MeTPeak are specifically designed for epitranscriptome peak calling of MeRIP-Seq data. MeTPeak outperforms exomePeak in robustness against data variance and can detect less enriched peaks [90] and exomePeak achieves better motif enrichment than MeTPeak in some cases [91] . Recently, an updated version of exomePeak has been released officially on Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/ html/exomePeak2.html), which corrects the GC content bias generated by PCR amplification during the library preparation, a common bias among MeRIP-Seq samples. exomePeak2 should be another promising peak calling tool for MeRIP-Seq data.",

            "text": "By directly learning the RNA modification sites reported from high-throughput sequencing approaches, a large number of prediction models have been established for the computational identification of RNA modification sites from the primary sequences of the RNA molecule as well as by taking advantage of other information [71, 92, 93] . Thanks to the development of sequencing technology such as miCLIP and PA-m 6 A-seq for m 6 A, it becomes possible to train m 6 A site prediction models using machine learning approaches, which extract features from the primary sequences centered around the m 6 A sites to predict the probability of another nucleotide being a methylation site or not. The sequence features mainly contain nucleotide chemical and physiochemical property, K-mer frequency, nucleotide encoding (including one-hot, spectrum encoding, word embedding, Gene2vec, et.al), and various genomic features (including nucleotide position, i.e., the relative position on 3 0 UTR, 5 0 UTR and whole transcript, the length of the transcript region containing the modification site, the evolutionary conservation score, et.al). The adopted machine learning algorithms may range from support vector machine, random forest, XGBoost to more advanced deep learning models such as CNN, LSTM and GRU. For example, iRNA-Methyl [94] extracted ''pseudo dinucleotide composition\" feature where three RNA physiochemical properties were incorporated and trained a SVM model; SRAMP [68] encoded the RNA and DNA sequence using one-hot binary encoding, spectrum encoding and K-nearest neighbor encoding (KNN encoding), and trained 10 RF models using balanced training dataset; Deep-M6ASeq [95] encoded the nucleotide using one-hot and trained a CNN + BLSTM model; WHISTLE extracted the most comprehensive features including nucleotide chemical property and 35 additional genomic features, and achieved state-of-the-art performance with SVM classifier. These approaches consider only the sequence features while ignore the methylation levels under specific context. Considering this, Deep-m6A [96] was proposed to predict context-specific m 6 A sites using a CNN model which encode the RNA sequence together with context-specific MeRIP-Seq reads count. Song et al. has developed pseudouridine site identification and functional annotation webserver (named PIANO), which trained a high-accuracy predictor that takes input of both conventional sequence features and 42 additional genomic features [97] .",

Since these methylation sites are differentially between two biological conditions, they are more likely to be functionally related to the perturbation factor of the samples, which can be disease association or responses to a particular treatment of samples. A number of computational approaches have been developed to identify differential methylation sites from MeRIP-Seq data by comparing samples under two different biological conditions based on different assumption of reads count distribution and statistical models. exo-mePeak [89] takes the hypothesis that read counts arising from a particular genomic region follows Poisson distributions and adopts a rescaled version of Fisher's exact test to detect differential methylation peaks. exomePeak2 uses a generalized linear model to handle the over-dispersion of reads count and GC content bias. MeTDiff [98] models biological variation with beta-binomial model and applies a likelihood ratio test to test differential methylation peaks. DRME [99] and QNB [100] both adopt negative binomial distributions to model the reads count fall into the methylation region. DRME considers the variance is smooth function of the reads abundance, while QNB assumes it also depends on the percentage of methylation. RADAR [101] models the reads count distribution using a Poisson random effect model and adopts generalized linear model framework to detect differential methylation peaks. Limited to the resolution of MeRIP-Seq, these approaches can only identify differential methylation regions of 50-100 bps. To infer the real altered methylation sites, DMDeep-m6A [102] was proposed to predict differential methylation sites at single-base resolution from MeRIP-Seq data. Moreover, to identify RNA editing sites, RNA-editing tests (REDITs) was developed based on a suite of tests that employ beta-binomial models [103] .",

This is adopted by DEQ [104] , which believes the consensus result of DESeq2 GLM, edgeR GLM and QNB should be real differential methylation peaks. In this way, the detected differential peaks are supposed to have lower false positive rate meanwhile lose much sensitivity. exomePeak has been widely used for differential m 6 A peak calling with high sensitivity. MeTDiff, DRME and QNB aim to detect more accurate differential peaks when sample size is small and have achieved lower false positive rate than exome-Peak, while losing some sensitivities for more rigorous statistical test. RADAR can achieve lower false positive rate and higher sensitivity when the replication sample size is greater than 6 (not available for most published MeRIP-Seq data) and when the available samples are no more than 2, RADA gets similar false positive rate but lower sensitivity comparing with exomePeak [101] . Generally, researchers can choose different approaches based on their requirement and MeRIP-Seq sample size. They may use exomePeak when a high sensitivity is required and there are some subsequential strategies to control the false positive rate; MeTDiff, DRME or QNB is suitable when less differential peaks with relatively higher degree of differential methylation are required; RADAR performs better when there are more replication samples; and DMDeep-m6A works well when the inference of single-base differential methylation sites from MeRIP-seq data is required.",

Generalized linear mixed model is a popular model to analyze variance in gene expression for time-course RNA-seq data. However, limited to the small sample size of MeRIP-seq data, the methods for RNAseq data can't be directly applied for MeRIP-seq data.

The annotation includes genomic features (strand, associated gene, coding sequence, untranslated region, intron, associated repetitive element, et.al) and annotation of overlapping gene annotations, genomic nucleotide conservation, overlapping SNP database entries and overlapping repetitive elements that can be visualized in UCSC genome browser. REDIportal contains the largest and comprehensive collection of RNA editing in humans and mice including more than 4.5 million of A-to-I events detected in 55 body sites from thousands of RNAseq experiments. REDIportal embeds RADAR database and designed its own browser (JBrowse) that show A-to-I changes and the neighboring annotations in user defined genomic context. For each RNA editing site, REDIportal provide different info such as: 1) genomic features, including the genomic position, the reference and edited nucleotide, the strand, the editing location, the gene symbol according to Gencode v19 and the genic region; 2) editing level, including the number of edi-ted samples, the potential amino acid change, the PhastCons conservation score across 46 organisms and a flag indicating in which database (ATLAS [117] , RADAR [110] or DARNED [118] ) is reported; and 3) neighboring annotations, including the dbSNP accession and the repeated element.",

The m6ASNP collected two kinds of datasets: 1) SNP from dbSNP for human and mouse [124] ; and 2) m 6 A modification sites from two miCLIP-seq studies [125, 126] , two PA-m6A-seq experiments [127] and 244 MeRIP-seq samples. m6ASNP firstly trained a random forest (RF) model to predict m 6 A site in single-base resolution using the primary RNA sequence and secondary structure features. Based on the RF model, m6ASNP mapped the genetic variants to known methylated transcript and checked whether the methylation status was changed by their neighboring sequence variants comparing to the wild-type transcript. If an m 6 A site occurred in the wild-type transcript and disrupted in the mutant transcript, m6ASNP defined it as an m 6 A-associated loss variant and vice versa. m6ASNP constructed three confidence levels of m 6 Aassociated variants annotation. The high-confidence-level annotation contains m 6 A sites derived from miCLIP-seq and PA-m 6 A-seq dataset; the medium-confidence-level annotation contains m 6 A sites obtained from MeRIP-seq detected methylation peak where the DRACH motifs were significantly altered by SNP; the lowconfidence-level annotation contains m 6 A sites that predicted by m6ASNP whole transcriptome widely. To further mine the function of m 6 A-associated variants, m6ASNP annotated the m 6 Aassociated variants by their neighboring RBP sites [128] , miRNA target sites [128] and canonical splicing sites, and conducted GWAS analysis to infer disease-association for m 6 A-associated SNPs [129] . Using the same analysis pipeline defined in m6ASNP, m6AVar [107] was developed as the first comprehensive database of m 6 A-associated variants. m6AVar is a powerful resource for investigating the relationship between m 6 A-associated variants and diseases.",

Moreover, some researchers tried to build the relationship between SNPs and methylation level of m 6 A sites, and further tested cis-associations between methylation peaks and SNPs within specific region. Zhang et al have applied a linear model implemented in FastQTL [132] to detect the associations between SNPs and m 6 A sites within 100 kb from m6A-seq data in lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from 60 Yoruba (YRI) individuals [133] . This pipeline is similar to eQTLs or sQTLs and they defined the significant associations as m 6 A QTL. To account for multiple genetic variants tested for each peak, a permutation strategy adopted by FastQTL software [132] was performed. m 6 A QTLs are found to be largely independent of eQTLs and enriched with binding sites of RBPs [134] , RNA structure-changing variants [135] and transcriptional features. And m 6 A QTLs are more likely to be other kind of QTLs than random SNP-gene pairs, suggesting functional associations between m 6 A and other molecular phenotypes based on five downstream traits analysis: mRNA expression; ribosome binding; protein level; mRNA decay rate; and alternative polyadenylation (APA). Similar with the previous m 6 A-associated SNP studies, m 6 A QTLs are found to contribute to the heritability of various immune and blood-related traits by GWAS analysis. The TWAS/FUSION [136, 137] was also applied treating m 6 A as a molecular-level trait to determine the correlations of m 6 A levels and specific phenotype.",

Therefore, the behaviors of functional m 6 A sites and their carrying genes are supposed orchestrated in complex networks. Based on this hypothesis, some computational methods in particular network-based approaches have been developed to predict the key RNA methylation sites and their mediated functions and disease-association ( Table 2 ). The approaches were summarized based on the modification type it is developed for (Modification Type), whether it is developed for RNA methylation function prediction (Function Prediction) or disease association prediction (Disease Association) and whether the predicted results are for methylation sites (Site-based) or their carrying genes (Gene-based).",

The m 6 A-driven genes refer to genes whose mRNAs harbor differential RNA methylation sites, thus may be under dynamic epitranscriptomic regulation, and be functionally significant to the biological contexts of interest. m 6 A-driven genes were identified in four steps by the m6A-Driver algorithm: 1) replicate-specific prediction of differential methylation carrying genes using exomePeak; 2) replicate-specific prediction of candidate differential methylation site carrying genes with RWR algorithm; 3) topological and functional significance-based evaluation of the candidate differential methylation carrying genes; 4) construction of a consensus m 6 Adriven gene network from edges across all replicates. Starting from MeRIP-Seq data, m6A-Driver can predict functional methylation sites carrying genes and their mediated functional circuit. A major limitation of m6A-Driver method is that, it only models the functional interactions between differential methylation carrying genes but ignores the functional interaction of differential methylation carrying genes with known signaling pathways and their up-and down-stream genes in the pathways. The FunDMDeep-m6A method was proposed to help reveal the dynamics of m 6 A level under a specific context and identify the genes, functions and pathways mediated by the dynamic m 6 A methylation using data from MeRIP-seq [102] . FunDMDeep-m6A develops, at the first step, DMDeep-m6A to identify differential m 6 A methylation sites from MeRIP-Seq data at a single-base resolution, and then identifies and prioritizes functional differential methylation carrying genes by combing differential methylation with differential expression analysis using a network-based method. A novel m 6 A-signaling bridge (MSB) score was devised to quantify the functional significance of differential methylated genes by assessing functional interaction of these genes with their signaling pathways via a heat diffusion process in PPI networks. FunDMDeep-m6A can identify more context-specific and functionally significant functional methylation genes than m6A-Driver. Taking FunDMDeep-m6A as prediction engine, Funm6AViewer webserver and R package were developed to prioritize contextspecific functional m 6 A-carrying genes, characterize and visualize the differential m 6 A sites, and construct and functionally interpretate the gene interaction networks mediated by RNA methylation, including its functionality, relation to gene expression, and network topology [142] .",

Consistent with current researches, Hot-m6A reveals that m 6 A targets key genes of many important biological processes (e.g., transcription, cell organization and transport, and cell proliferation) and cancer related pathways (e.g., Wnt pathway, Ras signaling, and PI3K-Akt signaling pathway). The disease-association analysis prioritized five diseases including leukemia and renal cell carcinoma along with the corresponding m 6 A regulated marker genes. This pipeline provided new leads for understanding m 6 A regulatory functions and its roles in disease pathogenesis. However, the analysis was conducted in gene level, and only the m 6 A site with the highest methylation level of a gene was considered, which may lead to the loss of some information.",

RNAMethyPro was built based on a multivariate Cox regression model, which was trained using the corresponding training dataset for each cancer type. Then, the derived formula, i.e., RNAMethyPro, was subsequently used to calculate the risk scores predictive of overall survival or relapse-free survival. Patients in each cohort were stratified into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups based on the risk scores predicted by RNAMethyPro and the performance of RNAMethyPro is validated by survival analysis, gene set enrichment analysis, ESTIMATE [160] analysis of stromal and immune content and network analysis for different risk groups.",

In the last decade, the epitranscriptome profiling approaches have been well established for a dozen of RNA modifications, and the epitranscriptome of many species under various biological contexts have bene collected and publically available from existing bioinformatics databases. Nevertheless, the functional epitranscriptome, which consists of the functional modification sites along with their mediated functions and disease association, remains unclear. We have summarized here the current bioinformatics approaches for functional annotation and prediction of RNA modifications, including the prediction of functional RNA modification sites and their hosting genes, along with RNA modification-mediated functions, disease association and diagnosis/prognosis. Started from the successfully identified RNA modification sites, there are mainly two ways of functional analysis of RNA modifications: 1) the distance-based path that associate various biological events with RNA modification sites based on their proximity on the genome. 2) the omics-based path that predicts functional methylation sites/genes with their mediated functions and associated diseases using complex network-based methods from largescale omic data.",

There exists certainly a large number of false positive association and the potential regulatory mechanism is not clear. Though some works such as m6Var and m6A-Atlas have defined m 6 A-associated SNPs as SNPs that can alter m 6 A methylation sites according to machine learning analysis, it is difficult to validate those predictions directly with experimental data due to the lack of paired epitranscriptome profiles from the wild type and mutated samples.",

The straight-forward mapping of methylation sites to genes presumes the dynamic sites can disturb gene functions but ignores the site-specific regulation mechanism when there exist multiple RNA methylation sites on the same transcript. For m 6 A methylation, the m 6 A sites located on 3 0 UTR and CDS near the stop codon of mRNA are more likely to mediate mRNA stability and degradation, which is correlated with gene expression level, while the m 6 A sites located on 5 0 UTR and caps of mRNA are more likely to mediate mRNA translation efficiency, which is correlated with the protein expression level. Different locations and characteristics of methylation sites may lead to different mechanisms and levels of regulation, then it is important to quantify the regulation of methylation sites rather than the whole genes. Some approaches such as FunDMDeep-m6A have simply quantified the regulation level of methylation sites by combing the differential gene expression with differential methylation under specific biological context (e.g., stem cell differentiation), while only the gene expression level is considered with the location information ignored. Conceivably, it may be more convictive if the network-based approach considers the detailed regulatory mechanism of every individual sites in the future.",

The primary mode of m 6 A post-transcriptional regulation is mRNA stability regulation, where YTHDF1-3 selectively bind to m 6 A sites to promote mRNA decay [172] . The methylation level of specific m 6 A sites and gene expression may have tightly correlation under specific condition. A common challenge in studying condition-specific m 6 A regulatory functions is the limited MeRIP-seq replicates. Some efficient approaches such as DESeq2 [173] have been developed to process small samples of RNA-seq data, which can inspire the solution for limited MeRIPseq replicates. Xiao et al. provided the first transcriptome-wide analysis of splicing changes induced by YTHDC1 knockdown [5] and some researchers also revealed the m 6 A erasers, such as FTO, could influence RNA alternative splicing [174] . Due to the limited sequencing depth, it is difficult to identify alternative splicing sites from input samples of MeRIP-Seq data, while it is still interesting if the distribution of m 6 A sites and splicing sites can be compared to find some patterns for further correlation analysis. m 6 A can affect the efficiency of mRNA translation via m 6 A-binding protein YTHDF1 or directly recruiting some translation initial factors depending on m 6 A in specific biological context [3, 175] . The regulation pattern may be different depends on the distribution of m 6 A sites, the binding of translation factor recruited by m 6 A readers or writers and different contexts (e.g., cell lines, treated conditions). Some regression or correlation analysis methods can be adopted to uncover the RNA sequence-based or gene-specific m 6 A regulated translation patterns under specific condition.",

Recent studies have unveiled the critical role of RNA modifications during virus infection [179] . Although m6A-Atlas provided the viral epitranscriptome of ten different viruses, it should be interesting to further label host m 6 A sites that may regulate the fate of endogenous retroviruses [180] or functions during virus infection. (2) Relevance to RNA structure. A number of studies have shown that RNA modifications may affect RNA structure [181] [182] [183] [184] [185] . Permeably, RNA modification sites that can change its overall structure are likely to be functionally critical. However, a systematic labeling of all the RNA modification sites that can modify the structure is yet available. (3) Isoform specificity. Most existing epitranscriptome profiling approaches suffers from an isoform ambiguity problem, i.e., it is unclear whether an RNA modification site is located on a specific isoform transcript when there exist multiple isoform RNAs transcribed from the same DNA coordinate. As a result, isoform specificity of RNA modification is not provided in any of the bioinformatics databases. Labeling isoform belonging clearly provides more detailed information of the RNA modification. Recently, a computational model MetaTX shed some light on this issue from a statistical perspective by taking advantage of the overall distribution pattern of RNA modification [186] and a computational package Episo was also developed to quantify epitranscriptomal RNA m 5 C at the transcript isoform level [187] . The Nanopore technology provide a parallel experimental solution [188] [189] [190] [191] [192] [193] [194] . (4) Evolutionary conservation of individual RNA modification sites. Conservation has been a very powerful perspective to study the function of protein and DNA sequences. Conceivably, conserved RNA modification sites, i.e., RNA modification occurs on the homologous regions of different species, survived from nature selection, and are thus likely to be functionally important for the organisms. Currently, the conservation information is only available for m 6 A RNA methylation through the m 6 A-Atlas [51] database. It should be interesting to further label the conservation status all other RNA modification sites. ",
