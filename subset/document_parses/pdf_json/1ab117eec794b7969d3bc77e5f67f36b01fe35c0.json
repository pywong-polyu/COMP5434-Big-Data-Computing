For example, adding assets that decrease a portfolio's skewness (and thus making them more left-skewed) should result in higher expected returns. Skewness is consequently a key element in models of risk and return, particularly for short-and mediumterm investors (Adcock, 2014) . During periods of excess volatility, investors realize that their expected returns will not materialize and switch to less risky assets, thereby introducing increased negative skewness to the price of risk.",

Chan and Marsh (2020) show that the market's trajectory in the coronavirus crisis resembles that of the Great Depression and the Lehman Brothers collapse, but newer data for the coronavirus era show a quicker market rebound since the U.S. market low on March 23, 2020. This phenomenon might be the result of the different and exogenous nature of the coronavirus crisis, with markets perceiving that the economy will rebound more easily and, perhaps more importantly, because of the quickly enhanced liquidity by policy makers. We note, however, that the coronavirus market crash was much deeper than the 2008 crash, reflecting a very strong investor reaction as well as associated changes in risk and investment horizons.",

            "text": "Specifically, we examine the joint effects of price shocks reflected in the October 87, subprime and coronavirus crises on the distribution of returns using a skewed extension of the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity in the mean (GARCH-M) model from Glosten et al. (1993) . Two important underlying assumptions in the empirical risk-return trade-off literature are the constant market price of risk and the symmetric conditional distribution for returns (Theodossiou and Savva, 2016) . First, our model specification relaxes the above assumptions and allows for time-varying skewness and kurtosis under a very flexible distribution (skewed generalized error distribution, or SGED), with upside and downside volatility effects incorporated into the 3rd and 4th moments. The SGED distribution has the appealing property of allowing us to develop exponential asset pricing equations, thereby significantly improving flexibility. Second, these effects are incorporated into the risk-return trade-off, which is also time varying and is decomposed into two components: the pure price of risk and the skewness/kurtosis price of risk. The skewness/kurtosis equation depends on the conditional asymmetry parameter, and these factors together determine how the pure and skewness prices of risk affect expected returns. Importantly, we derive the risk-neutral equation of returns, which shows the effects of crises, skewness and other parameters on equilibrium returns. Our model's key prediction is that a negative crisis parameter value implies a negative unconditional asymmetry parameter and yields a negatively skewed distribution for returns. We estimate our model using data from the S&P 500 Index for the period January 2, 1980 to October 14, 2020 (10,286 daily continuously compounded returns). We use maximum likelihood estimation with robust standard errors and obtain confidence intervals with the procedure of Rapach and Wohar (2009) . Our main results show the importance of modeling crisis periods and associated skewness in asset pricing models. Aside from finding large volatility increases in the crisis periods, and consistently with our theoretical priors, we show that the conditional skewness price of risk is indeed negative in our full sample. Importantly, the con-ditional skewness price of risk drops (becomes more negative) by approximately 3.8 and 2.5 times during the October 87 and subprime crises compared with the \"regular\" period, whereas the equivalent decrease during the coronavirus crisis is approximately 4.4 times larger than that in the regular period. These decreases show the immense reaction of investors during crisis periods, as well as the rapid changes in sentiment regarding portfolio risk and the investment horizon. Evidently, the negative reactions were deeper during the coronavirus crisis than in the subprime crisis. Finally, we show that accounting for skewness in our model allows for the theoretically positive risk-return relation to be maintained.",

For financial assets, the skewness premia have been found to be negative (e.g., Savva and Theodossiou, 2018) . This finding is a result of stronger investor reactions in downside than upside markets resulting in larger downside volatility and consequently in a negatively skewed distribution for equilibrium returns. In turn, negative skewness implies a negative asymmetry parameter ( t+1|t < 0) and negative skewness premia (\u0131 t+1|t t+1|t < 0). One possible explanation for this phenomenon is that large increases in volatility induce investors to move out of stocks and into bonds, thereby driving current prices down and resulting in larger future returns for stocks; e.g., Campbell and Hentschel (1992) and Harrison and Zhang (1999) . The risk premium decomposition implied by Eq. (26) resembles that of Bollerslev et al. (2018) , wherein the market risk premium is decomposed into its \"normal\" sized price fluctuations risk and jump tail risk. The left jump tail risk, as well as the negative skewness premium, may be seen as proxies for market fear; see also Bollerslev and Todorov (2011) .",

That is, negative values of h t+1|t yield negative t+1|t values and vice versa. The intercept 0 , a measure of unconditional asymmetry, can be negative, zero, or positive. For a negatively skewed distribution, the intercept is expected to be negative (and vice versa for a positive value). The crisis parameter D,j measures the impact of crises on the intercept; thus, a negative value indicates a higher degree of skewness during the crisis period. The coefficient N measures the marginal impact of downside price shocks on the asymmetry index h t+1|t and the asymmetry parameter t+1|t . A positive value indicates that past downside price shocks have a positive impact on both h t+1|t and t+1|t (and vice versa). A large downside shock triggered by a disastrous decline in portfolio values will result in lower conditional asymmetry parameter t+1|t in the next period and thus a larger probability for downside markets. Consequently, the skewness risk premium in Eq. (23) will decline, thereby resulting in higher future expected returns; see Savva and Theodossiou (2018) for further discussion of this effect. Higher future expected returns are associated with larger equity premia, as in Wachter (2013) . This association is also consistent with Farago and Tedongap (2018) , who show that downside risk is priced in cross section asset returns. In contrast, the coefficient P measures the marginal impact of past price shocks on h t+1|t and t+1|t . Positive values indicate that past upside price shocks have a positive impact on the parameters (and vice versa). The coefficient h measures the persistence of past upside and downside shocks on the conditional values of h t+1|t and t+1|t .",

Since its inception, the SGED has been used in the literature for the measurement of risk, pricing of options, and modeling of the time-series behavior of returns of stock indices, currencies, oil, precious metals and so forth. In contrast to the skewed generalized t that is often used in empirical work, the SGED enables the development of asset exponential asset pricing equations.

Panel C of Table 2 reports the estimated parameters for the asymmetry index h t+1|t and the asymmetry parameter t+1|t of the conditional distribution of daily returns. The intercept of the asymmetry index is negative and statistically significant, thus indicating a negatively skewed distribution of returns. The bootstrap intervals for its deviations in the October 87, subprime and coronavirus periods are statistically significant and negative, thereby implying larger negative values during the three crisis periods and thus more-negatively skewed distribution for returns. The coefficient for past downside market shocks is also negative, thus indicating a negative impact of such shocks on current values of the asymmetry index and parameter. However, the coefficient for past upside market shocks is positive, thereby indicating a positive impact on current values of the asymmetry index and parameter. Finally, the coefficient for past values of the asymmetry index is negative, thus indicating strong mean reversion of the asymmetry index over time. Table 3 reports the monthly means of the conditional asymmetry values, t+1|t , during the October 87, subprime, coronavirus and regular periods. During the regular period, their mean value is -0.0555, showing that on average, 5.55 % more returns positioned to the left of the conditional mode of the distribution of returns (negative skewness). The respective percentages during the October 87, subprime and coronavirus crisis periods are 28.54 %, 13.36 % and 25.95 %. Fig. 3 confirms the significant decrease in the asymmetry parameter t+1|t during the three crisis periods. The decrease in the monthly averages is indeed considerably deeper for the October 87 and coronavirus periods, showing more negative skewness than that in the subprime and regular periods.",

The most important of these tests is that our model somehow places unequal weight on the COVID-19 crisis than on the other crises included in our baseline model or crises not included in our baseline model (e.g., the Dot-com bubble and the 09/11 crash). To this end, we rerun our model with different sets of crises. For expositional brevity, in Table 4 , for each model, we report only the skewness price of risk parameters \u0131 for the regular and crises periods, as well as the tests for the differences in the means (equivalent of Panel E, Table 3 ). Specifically, we report results from models including the The notable results are as follows. First, the mean and standard deviation for the COVID-19 period remain very similar to our baseline results, thus implying that including different crises in our model does not significantly affect the skewness price of risk of the COVID-19 crisis. Second, the additional crises included (Recession 90, 09/11, Dot-com and SARS/H1N1) have more negative skewness price of risk than that in the regular period. The 09/11 crisis has the highest mean-standard deviation ratio (significant at the 1% level), followed by the Dot-com crisis (significant at the 5% level), the Recession 90 crisis (significant at the 5% level) and SARS/H1/N1 crisis (significant at the 10 % level). Thus, our model captures the relative importance of any crisis included in the empirical analysis. Third, extending the period of the subprime crisis (to cover all of 2010) does not significantly affect our baseline results.",

We define the conditional moment equations as functions of the subprime and COVID-19 crises, and we show theoretically that skewness becomes more negative in crisis periods. We further define the risk-neutral equilibrium equation for returns as a function of crisis periods. Notably, in equilibrium, skewness is an additive parameter affecting the variance on returns (the pure price of risk). This result is impor-tant theoretically, because the model allows the effect of the pure price of risk on returns to be positive (consistent with a positive risk and return relation). We estimate our model using S&P 500 data for January 2, 1980 to October 14, 2020. We use the skewed generalized error distribution, for which we derive the distribution of returns, the likelihood function, robust standard errors and bootstrapped confidence intervals. Our results show extreme skewness during the October 87, subprime and COVID-19 crises, whereas the skewness during other turmoil periods is significantly milder. In fact, the skewness during the COVID-19 crisis overshadows that during the subprime crisis.

The periods for the October 87 market crash is October 15, 1987 to January 11, 1988, the subprime crisis April 1, 2008 to April 30, 2010 and the coronavirus crisis February 21, 2010 to October 14, 2020. The coefficient c measures the impact of conditional standard deviation of returns on their conditional mode and is interpreted as the \"pure price of risk\". The conditional mean of returns t +1| t is given by Eq. (23), where \u0131t +1| t is the skewness price of risk. The lower part of the table reports the arithmetic averages of the conditional Pearson's conditional coefficients of skewness and kurtosis, computed using the Eqs.(15)and(16).",
