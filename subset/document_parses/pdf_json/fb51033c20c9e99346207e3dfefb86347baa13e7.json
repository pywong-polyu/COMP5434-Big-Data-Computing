Healthcare workers play a critical role in building trust between the public and the immunization program and are generally cited as the most trusted source of information on vaccination. Healthcare workers themselves, therefore, must be confident in vaccination as a public health good and able to transmit this confidence to those who trust them. However, just as with the general public, healthcare workers develop confidence at different rates and may be susceptible to misinformation about vaccines.",

            "text": "Vaccines present an important measure for gaining control of the COVID-19 pandemic and research has been occurring at an accelerated rate to provide safe, effective vaccines. 1, 2 In September 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) released a Values Framework for the Allocation and Prioritization of COVID-19 Vaccination suggesting that countries should prioritize HCWs, older adults, and adults with chronic diseases to receive the first doses of an approved COVID-19 vaccine. 3 Healthcare workers are among the public's most trusted sources of information on vaccines and vaccination. 4 But not all HCWs eagerly accept or promote COVID-19 vaccines. Studies from around the world have found nurses to be more hesitant towards COVID-19 vaccination than other HCWs. 5\u22127 Women have been identified by several studies to be more vaccine hesitant than men. 6,8\u221214 Studies from Latin America and the Caribbean have found ruraldwelling, lower education, and financial insecurity to be associated with vaccine hesitancy among both HCWs and the public. 12, 15 These findings agree with others found elsewhere. 11, 13, 16 The Caribbean has a long history of being a global leader in immunization. 17 A recent study conducted among British HCWs, finds those of Caribbean descent to be most COVID-19 vaccine hesitant (38.1% -51-0%), 14 but the rate of hesitance among Caribbean HCWs in the Caribbean has not been evaluated. This paper reports on a 2021 Internet-based survey conducted among 1197 healthcare workers from 14 Caribbean countries. The objectives were to gather and use quality data on behavioral and social drivers of vaccination and COVID-19 vaccines among HCWs in the Caribbean, and to inform implementation strategies and communication approaches on COVID-19 vaccines (and vaccines in general) in the Caribbean, with the final aim to contribute to increasing vaccination acceptance and improving vaccine confidence among healthcare workers.",

Technology and social media are being used on an unprecedented scale to keep people safe, informed, productive, and connected. But the newly developed COVID-19 vaccines have also been significant targets of mis-and disinformation, leading to public mistrust and concern. Social media has been demonstrated to be a powerful channel for propagating anti-vaccine information and diminish uptake of vaccines. 18\u221220 But when social media is used for good \u2212 to spread reliable vaccine information from trusted healthcare workers and public health authorities \u2212 it can foster public trust in vaccination. 18 Targeting HCWs with helpful communication is important to increase vaccine uptake. 21 Studies of HCWs in Europe and Canada found concerns about vaccine safety to be a key influencer of vaccine hesitancy. 22, 23 In France, vaccine information specifically targeting HCW have shown to increase vaccine uptake among hospital staff 24 and HCWs' trust in the institutions delivering information on vaccines and vaccination is essential for vaccine acceptance. 22 A study among HCWs in Mexico found information and being well-informed to be keys to vaccine uptake. 25 ",

The resulting sample size (n = 761) was allocated proportionally across countries as shown in Table 1 . Sample size was calculated using OpenEpi v3.01. 29 Although it was hoped that the call for participation would yield healthcare workers in the sample that followed roughly the same proportions as the population, no attempt was made to stratify the sample within countries and no limits were placed on the number of respondents from any eligible HCW category.",

The electronic supplement includes a post-hoc factor analysis to explore dimensionality of the questionnaire. Missing responses prevented calculating factor scores, but hesitancy came through as a clear theme in the first factor identified. Table 2 summarizes the portion of respondents in various categories who said they agree or strongly agree with the survey's opinion questions. Concerning attitudes to vaccines, respondents displayed widespread agreement with 90% or more agreeing that vaccines are safe and efficient, and a good way to protect oneself from disease. They agreed that vaccine information provided by public health authorities and healthcare providers is reliable and trustworthy. All the sub-groups but one reported at least 90% agreement that they do what their health care provider recommends about vaccines. Nurses and allied health professionals showed lower agreement with that latter statement (91% and 87%, respectively) than physicians (94%); those differences were statistically significant after adjusting for age and gender (p = 0 \u00a3 044 and 0\u00a2033, respectively). While most of both genders (90\u221299%) agreed with the seven pro-vaccine attitude questions (Q6-Q12), females agreed even more than males.

The primary construct identified as part of the qualitative analysis was related to doubts regarding vaccine safety (31%). Many respondents pointed to their concerns regarding potential long-term side effects caused by the vaccines as a reason for influencing their opinion and for refusing or delaying the COVID-19 vaccine. Similarly, an important number of answers within the thinking and feeling domain fell under the construct related to confidence in vaccine benefits (28%). These answers pointed to sentiments of uncertainty on the length of the immunity provided by the vaccine, as well as the protection (or lack thereof) against variants of concern. Another important and significant construct that the respondents reported was related to trust (or lack thereof) in the COVID-19 vaccines (20%) (Figure 6 ). Some respondents argued that a low prevalence of the disease in their country at the time the survey was available rendered the COVID-19 vaccines unnecessary. Others suggested that if a different brand of the COVID-19 vaccines were made available, their intent of getting vaccinated would change toward vaccine acceptance. Among the responses classified under the social processes' domain, the most influential number of answers involved HCWs confidence (or lack thereof) in their health authorities. Respondents voiced concerns on issues such as authoritieshandling of the pandemic and the messaging communicated to the public. This issue is exacerbated when combined with vaccine safety concerns. Issues related to global equity appeared in some responses, with participants indicating skepticism that their countries would already be receiving quality vaccines. Some HCWs reported negative information as influencing their opinion but on the other hand, other HCWs pointed to a lack of information as influencing their opinion on the COVID-19 vaccines.",

            "text": "Vaccination is one of public healths most effective tools for protecting populations from many dangerous diseases, including now against COVID-19; however, some HCWs are not fully convinced of the effectiveness and safety of these new vaccines, which can result in a delay or refusal to get vaccinated when offered. Healthcare workers are the first priority population for vaccination against COVID-19, as established by SAGE in the roadmap for prioritizing uses of COVID-19 vaccines in the context of limited supply, and they are the most trusted source of vaccine and vaccination-related information to the general population. 3, 34 Eighty-eight percent of respondents said they would recommend a COVID-19 vaccine to friends and family. The concerns, attitudes and intended practices of physicians, nurses, and other healthcare workers influence the social and behavioral drivers of vaccination among the general public. Formerly hesitant workers who research the issues and decide to be vaccinated may be especially relatable and persuasive to patients or family members who have lingering doubts. 35 In this study assessing the intention of healthcare workers to get the COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, 77% of the participants would receive the vaccine and 23% could be qualified as vaccine hesitant. However, despite 23% of respondents indicating they would not get vaccinated against COVID-19 as soon as they had the opportunity, only 4% of respondents reported that they never intend to get vaccinated. Compared to other healthcare workers in the Americas, Caribbean healthcare workers are less hesitant than their colleagues in French Guiana, where 66.4% of healthcare workers were willing to be, or had already been, vaccinated against COVID-19. 36 Nurses were classified as hesitant at a rate twice more than physicians, and younger age quartiles reported more hesitancy to COVID-19 vaccination than older age groups. Our findings are consistent with similar studies carried out elsewhere. 6, 13, 23, 27 We also found important differences among specialties within professional categories, especially physicians and nurses. Clinicians and emergency physicians were more prone to want to get the vaccine as soon as possible, compared to general practitioners and family doctors. As Verger et al. noted, HCWs are not a homogeneous group, and most are not immunization experts, which is why building trust in this population requires providing credible information from trustworthy sources. 22 Regarding gender, other than some small but statistically significant difference concerning attitudes, the study did not find consistent differences in responses between male and women, an association that has been found in various papers. 6, 27, 37 We identified higher willingness for uptake of a COVID-19 vaccine in the oldest age group, which, at the time of the survey, was the most vulnerable group in terms of suffering severe outcomes from COVID-19. 27 The BeSD model can provide insight about vaccine uptake categorized into four related domains: how people think and feel about vaccines; social processes that can encourage or discourage vaccine uptake; individual s motivations to get vaccination \u2212 and in the case of HCWs, to recommend vaccination -and practical issues that can facilitate or hinder vaccination. Qualitative analysis of open-ended questions using the BeSD model confirmed and complemented the quantitative findings, with respondents expressing concerns related to perceived risks \u2212including in the long-term\u2212 with taking COVID-19 vaccines, doubts regarding the vaccinesability to effectively protect against COVID, and a lack of information from trusted sources or lack of trust in authorities as the study of Verger et al. reported. 22 Concerns for vaccination safety were common findings in other studies. 22, 37 There were some contrasting responses regarding vaccine safety. Gaps in perceived risk of COVID-19 vaccination versus risk of COVID-19 disease were widened by some respondents who answered that they did not see COVID-19 as a problem in their countries. The most repeated constructs mentioned by respondents (33%) were related to confidence in vaccine safety, benefits, and trust in new vaccines. In addition to the constructs already established in the WHO BeSD document, 26 eleven new constructs were identified among Caribbean HCW responses, including one expressing that respondents would be more inclined to accept vaccination if their preferred vaccine brand was available. Figure 5 highlights all eleven new constructs. The most influential construct under the social processes' domain was the lack of HCW confidence in their health authorities (10%), with participants including statements in the open-ended questions on mandating vaccines, dishonesty, and denial or hiding of adverse events.",
