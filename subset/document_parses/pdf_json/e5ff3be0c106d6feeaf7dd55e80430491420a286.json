By identifying Kerala's initial conditions when it was hit by the pandemic, and different components of the state's Covid policy, we conclude: While being subject to resource constraints faced by an Indian state located in a federal structure, Kerala contained its first Covid wave by preemptively formulating a comprehensive set of public actions-government actions that were supported and complemented by the state's citizens. This was achieved by leveraging and reinforcing the citizen's public trust in the state. Specifically, the state's pandemic response contained supportive measures to ensure that poor lives were not pitted against rich lives; rather, the aim was to protect all lives and livelihoods.",

While making this argument, we also explain how the state had to respect some significant resource constraints -particularly regarding the availability of test-kits.

            "text": "As noted by many social scientists, over the last 50 years Kerala has experienced sustained building of state capacity, and has led the country with respect to a host of social development indicators. Table 1 contrasts the state's social indicators with those of the country as a whole. 4 Table 1 not only demonstrates Kerala's commendable social achievements vis-\u00e0vis the rest of the country, it also shows that in some dimensions the state compares favourably with many developed nations. In explaining the state's impressive trajectory in social development, Patrick Heller (2020) writes: \"In Kerala, the social compact emerged from recurrent episodes of popular mobilisation-from the temple entry movement of the 1930s, to the peasant and workers' movements in the 1950s and 1960s, a mass literacy movement in the 1980s, the movement for people's decentralised planning in the 1990s, and, most recently, various gender and environmental movements. These movements not only nurtured a strong sense of social citizenship but also drove reforms that have incrementally strengthened the legal and institutional capacity for public action.\" Specifically, Heller posits the following three features to be the principal attributes of the 'Kerala model of development': (a) the creation of a robust social democracy, that is built on a pact between the state and its citizens; (b) the strengthening of a system of rights-based welfare and social safely that is rooted in the state's accountability to its citizens; and (c) the formalization of a structure of decentralized governance leading to empowered local governments and community-based development groups (like Kudumbashree-a network of women's self-help groups). 5 Further, regarding the existence of public trust in Kerala, Heller (2020) writes: \"Trust is hard to measure, but survey work that colleagues and I \u2026 recently conducted in 10 Indian cities that included Kochi, shows that across a wide range of measures, and across all classes, castes and religions, Malayalees have extremely high levels of trust in both their institutions and locally elected local representatives.\" Tharoor (2020) confirms: \"Kerala has spent generations creating the infrastructure to support social development, \u2026., it has a vibrant civil society, free and independent media, and a competitive political system, \u2026 the state's social compact reflects extremely high levels of trust in institutions and elected representatives.\" In our analysis, we make no attempt to 'measure' the amount of public trust that exists in Kerala; rather, accepting the pre-existence of substantial public trust in the state at the beginning of the pandemic, we clarify how the government has leveraged and reinforced this trust in designing its pandemic policy. 6 The trajectory of Kerala's social development, pursued from the 1950\u2032s through alternating coalitions of Communist and Congress-led governments, has led to the establishment of a very robust public health infrastructure in Kerala. The state currently has an effective three-tier public health system consisting of state-level tertiary hospitals, district-level hospitals, and community-level sub-centres and Primary Health Centres (PHCs), and has devolved significant power to local selfgovernment bodies like the local panchayats to run and fund the community-level healthcare units. 7 Further, Kerala spends about 60% of its health budget on human resources, and lays great emphasis on recruitment and training of dedicated healthworkers. Apart from doctors and nurses, the state engages a large number of healthworkers-in the form of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHA workers) and expanded staff rosters in the PHCs-to ensure citizen's easy access to comprehensive healthcare support. 8 These beneficial features of a well-run public health system have contributed in important ways in containing Covid-19 in Kerala. At the same time, certain disadvantageous features of Kerala, that have had the potential to make it more difficult for the state to fight the pandemic, should also be noted. These features are to be found in the economic and demographic characteristics of the state's population. Kerala is not very industrialized, and its state GDP is about a third of that of the richest Indian state of Maharashtra; per capita income in Kerala is about 55% of that of the state of Delhi. Kerala is also one of the most densely-populated states in 6 Heller (1995) argues that citizens of Kerala have a high level of trust in their government because they have fought for their rights and, in the process, have made the state accountable to its citizens. 7 In 2017, Kerala launched Mission Aardram (tenderness) with the aim of lowering out-of-pocket health expenditure. Under the Mission, PHCs were upgraded to Family Health Centres, with better staffing, longer working hours, and new sub-centres with specialists treating hypertension, diabetes, and depression. In district hospitals, the Aardram Mission introduced specialties like cardiology, nephrology, and neurology. 8 Kerala has a network of over 27,000 ASHA workers, who work alongside Kudumbashree health volunteers, Anganwadi (child-care) workers, and palliative-care workers.",

More than 3 million labourers from Kerala work outside India, with about 2.5 million in the Gulf countries-mainly in Dubai, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia. Another million labourers from Kerala work in the other industrialized states of India. 9 The out-migration, in turn, raises Kerala's demand for low-skilled workers for agriculture and other menial jobs. That demand is met by in-migration of 2.5 million workers from various states of India, especially Bihar, Orissa, and West Bengal. With the onset of the pandemic, a number of Keralites working outside the state have been returning home, while the in-migrants in the state have been leaving for their home states.

Thus, without any further calculations, we are assured that between 30 January and 17 May, the all-important 'disease reproduction number' R 0 did not exceed unity by any significant amount in the state. Surely, that confirms Kerala's laudatory performance in the first wave of the pandemic.",

Before initiating that discussion, we conclude the current section with a brief description of the 'second phase of the pandemic' in Kerala, which began in mid-May with the restarting of flights and train-travel in an out of Kerala. Specifically, while the first two lockdown cycles in India (25 March-14 April and 15 April-3 May) imposed blanket restrictions on intra-and inter-country travel, these restrictions were gradually lifted over the next two lockdown cycles (4 May-17 May and 18 May-31 May). Consequently, a significant number of primary patients again emerged in Kerala by mid-May. Such patients were substantially greater in number than in the first wave, simply because two sets of out-migrants were returning back home-Keralites flying back from the Gulf (and other) countries, and many more Keralites returning home by train from other Indian states. These primary patients, and consequent in-state secondary transmissions, gave rise to the second pandemic wave in Kerala, and this has turned out to be a more severe wave with respect to total disease-load as well as mortality. It is important to note that the second wave in Kerala was again caused by a surge in primary patients, and not by any significant shortcomings in the state's extant pandemic-fighting strategies. Thus, it can be hoped that the actions that succeeded in the first wave will also succeed in eventually containing the second phase of the pandemic in Kerala.",

In particular, it is heartening to note that even after containing the first wave, the heath personnel in Kerala were cognizant of the fact that the battle was not yet over. This view is admirably expressed by Dr. Sreejith Kumar: \"We have won the quarter-final. The semi-final would be a staggered easing up without a second wave of infection.

In our analysis of the pandemic in Kerala, we recognize that the state's action plan had two components-directives regarding individual and social behaviour (e.g., regarding physical distancing), and explicit acts by the state (e.g., expanding public quarantine spaces). Given that, and following the basic thrust of the Dreze and Sen (1989) logic, we consider 'state actions to be transformed into public actions' when the citizens accept and strengthen the state strategies by (a) following the state's directives, and (b) by complementing the state's explicit acts via private acts (e.g., by letting private spaces to be used as public quarantine zones).

Recognize that if Kerala was indeed underestimating the true number of infections due to limited testing, then the daily infection counts should have increased significantly after 27 April given the substantial increase in daily tests.

A suspected/infected individual will agree to be quarantined (either in a public or in a private space) only if she is assured that she will be adequately supported and looked-after during isolation. Similarly, with regard to contact-tracing, a citizen will be more willing to reveal herself to be a contact of an infected person only if she is assured that the subsequent testing and (if necessary) quarantining phase will be humane and supportive. In fact, in many Indian states, contact-tracing and quarantining strategies have failed to a great extent precisely because people have not trusted the state and/or their neighbours to provide the required assistance during testing and isolation.",

Rather, affluent citizens have opened up parts of their homes for use as public quarantine spaces, and health workers have been respected and supported. Citizen conflicts based on caste and religion have also been conspicuous by their absence in Kerala. Ray et. al. (2020) have emphasized that for the less-developed world, the tradeoff between lives and livelihood in a country in the midst of a pandemic essentially boils down to a trade-off between lives of two sets of people-the haves and the have-nots. In particular, severe restrictions on mobility and economic activities constitute a strategy of saving rich lives at the expense of poor lives. It is thus important to realize that in Kerala's first wave of the Covid pandemic, the state's social compact and its government's Covid strategy successfully managed to circumvent this tradeoff, in spite of the state being subjected to a sever national lockdown.

Similarly, citizens will be more willing to comply with lockdown restrictions if they trust that the state is indeed using the lockdown window to revamp its heath infrastructure, and that the lockdown will be withdrawn as soon as the health system is strengthened. In the absence of such trust, the state will have to spend real resources both to improve health facilities during lockdowns and to enforce lockdown restrictions on its citizens. Thus, lack of public trust can only be overcome by expending additional physical and financial resources. To the extent that the incremental cost of the latter resources is much greater for less-developed economies, the incremental value of social capital is that much greater for such countries.",
