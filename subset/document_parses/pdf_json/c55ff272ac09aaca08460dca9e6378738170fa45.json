            "text": "While the printed circuit board (PCB) has been widely considered as the building block of integrated electronics, the world is switching to pursue new ways of merging integrated electronic circuits with textiles to create flexible and wearable devices. Herein, as an alternative for PCB, we described a non-printed integrated-circuit textile (NIT) for biomedical and theranostic application via a weaving method. All the devices are built as fibers or interlaced nodes and woven into a deformable textile integrated circuit. Built on an electrochemical gating principle, the fiber-woven-type transistors exhibit superior bending or stretching robustness, and were woven as a textile logical computing module to distinguish different emergencies. A fiber-type sweat sensor was woven with strain and light sensors fibers for simultaneously monitoring body health and the environment. With a photo-rechargeable energy textile based on a detailed power consumption analysis, the woven circuit textile is completely self-powered and capable of both wireless biomedical monitoring and early warning. The NIT could be used as a 24/7 private AI \"nurse\" for routine healthcare, diabetes monitoring, or emergencies such as hypoglycemia, metabolic alkalosis, and even COVID-19 patient care, a potential future on-body AI hardware and possibly a forerunner to fabric-like computers.",

For instance, unusual symptoms of many life-threatening diseases can be obtained from daily sweating profiles, serving as an effective quantitative index for early diagnosis [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, as the hardware foundation of flexible electronics, most integrated electronic (IC) systems are based on printed circuit boards (PCB), which have to be attached to the human body in an adorned and patch-like manner, as rigid boxes or bendable bandages [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . The healthcare electronics with the two-dimensional structure of traditional PCB devices, even though bendable or stretchable, still lack features that afford comfortability to the wearer such as air permeability and water absorption akin to clothing that humans naturally wear which are soft and deformable, breathable, durable, and washable [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, these types of equipment were psychologically burdensome and hindered long-term use especially for use in healthy lifestyle management.",

Recently, energy and sensor devices in the shape of fibers or fabric have gained wide attention [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, most integrated electronic circuits of these flexible devices were still built on rigid PCB modules. A game-changing solution for the issue is to develop a woven-textile alternative to PCB, which is not only constructed based on all fiber-shaped electric elements but also possesses a complete circuit within its woven pattern borne from the weaving process.",

For the second step, the solder mask and drilling were carried out to prepare for the subsequent welding of components. For the third step, the chips composed of transistor units were integrated on the board via welding methods. Each unit of a typical transistor device was assembled by stacking conductive and semi-conductive materials layer-by-layer, to form a sandwiched structure. At last, other components, like the battery units, were assembled on the board. A typical battery device was also assembled by stacking conductive and functional materials layer-by-layer, to form a flat structure or cylindrical structure. Such a PCB process has been massively reproduced in the electronic industry, to form complete integrated circuit systems inside computers and cell phones (Fig. 1b) .",

And, one end of each warp was fixed on a specially designed harness, so that all the warps were tilted up-and-down alternately to form a clamping opening. For the first step, we fabricated a wire-type integrated device containing both the optical sensor and the gate electrode of the transistor by coating two separate sections of MWCNT next to one conductive end of the light sensor fiber (Supplementary Note 1: Weaving process for the non-printed integrated-circuit textile; Supplementary Fig. 11 ). We then deposited a PEDOT: PSS layer between the two MWCNT sections, to serve as the gate electrode of the transistor. This wire-type integrated device could be fed into the clamping opening of the warps as a weft. Subsequently, after feeding the wire-type integrated device into the clamping opening, the tilting direction of each warp would be alternately changed to form a new clamping opening. Another PEDOT: PSS layer on the warp would then contact with the gate electrode of the transistor to form an intercross node, which could serve as a complete transistor unit with three terminal ends. For the third step, another wire-type integrated device containing both resistor unit and battery unit was fabricated. After assembling a Zn-MnO 2 type battery fiber along a cotton wire, we coated two separated sections of MWCNT next to the MWCNT end of the MnO 2 electrode of the batter (Supplementary Note 1: Weaving process for the non-printed integratedcircuit textile; Supplementary Fig. 12 ). Then, a layer of activated carbon was coated with the two MWCNTs to form a resistor fiber unit connected to the battery. The wire-type integrated device containing both resistor fiber and batter fiber could be also fed into a clamping opening of the warps as a weft. For the fourth step, after the wire-type integrated device was fed into the clamping opening, the tilting direction of each warp would alternately change and form a new clamping opening. Two MWCNT sections coated on different warps would then contact simultaneously with different conducting terminals of the battery and resistor, which would electrically collect the integrated device into the circuit. By repeating the weaving cycle, other weft containing other components, such as stress sensor and capacitors, etc., could be woven into the NIT-type IC, to enlarge the integrated circuit (Supplementary Figs. 13, 14) . Each fiber device could be encapsulated in a PMMA layer or further winded with fabric wires for better comfortability ( Supplementary  Fig. 15 ).",

These additional redox peaks may be attributed to the conversion of PEDOT nanocrystals from a face-to-face structure to a layered structure (Supplementary Fig. 19 ) with lower charge-transfer barriers, which allowed more in-depth doping/de-doping of Na-ions 35, 36 .",

For the sensor modules, we assembled a fiber-type sweat sensor and weaved this sensor with strain and light-sensing fibers for simultaneous body-health and environment monitoring ( Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs. [22] [23] [24] . Among them, the sweat sensor was crucial for probing biofluid from deeper in the body which may carry diverse molecules ranging from small metabolites to larger proteins. Integrating this with the profile analysis of body movements and environmental conditions would provide useful information for effective medical diagnosis. Figure 3a shows the structure and working principle of the fiber-type sweat sensor. Polyaniline (PANI) is a conductive polymer 37 that, together with CNT 38,39 , can be used for making robust and sensitive sensors. The fiber-type sweat sensor was assembled by the in-situ growth of PANI films on the PBT wire between two coaxially coated sections of MWCNTs. The pH sensor worked based on the reversible protonation/deprotonation process inside the PANI layer, which could lead to a reversible conversion of the PANI molecule between emeraldine salt and emeraldine base. Figure 3b and Supplementary Fig. 25 illustrate the resistance responses of an optimized wire-shaped pH sensor, measured within the pH of 3 to 8, in accordance with the pH value range for the sweat of both sub-healthy and healthy humans. A reversible linear relationship between resistance and pH value with a sensitivity of 40 k\u03a9 was achieved. Figure 3c shows the structure and working principle of the fiber-type motion sensor. We assembled this sensor by coating an activated carbon/polyvinylidene fluoride (AC/PVDF) layer onto the elastic wire, which was electrically led out by conductive MWCNTs. When the sensor was stretched under an external force, the average distance between any two AC particles inside AC/PVDF layer increased resulting in a change in resistance. Figure 3d and Supplementary Fig. 26 show the representative resistance responses of an optimized wire-shaped piezoresistive sensor, measured in 0-40% of tensile strain, in accordance with the range of tensile strain for the stretching of sportswear during running. A reversible linear relationship between the resistance and the tensile strain was observed, which showed a \u0394R/R of 2 at a 40% tensile strain. Figure 3e shows the structure and working principle of the fiber-type light sensor. We fabricated this sensor by winding an Au wire around a fiber-shaped electrode composed of PBT/Cu/ Mn/ZnO/Dye/CuI. When excited by photon, a pair of hole and electron would form on the ZnO/Dye/CuI interface, and then directionally separated to form a current or bias as a sensor output. Its current and voltage output would change along with the light intensity. Figure 3f and Supplementary Fig. 27 show both the open-circuit voltages (Voc) and the short-circuit currents (Isc) of light sensors within a range from dark to 2000 W/m 2 , which would cover possible illumination environments for normal human lives. A reversible linear relationship between short-circuit current and light intensity with a sensitivity of 0.03 A/W was observed, while the voltage tended to a stable value for light intensity above 800 W/m 2 .",

The flexible photo-rechargeable fabric woven in the NIT presents a self-powered energy solution for frequent charging, instead of traditional batteries with a rigid structure. To drive logic operation and sensor modules continuously, both a textile-type photovoltaic energy-harvesting component and rechargeable Zn/MnO 2 battery fiber were woven into the intelligent textile to form a sustainable and photo-rechargeable power supply (Supplementary Fig. 29 and Supplementary Fig. 30 ). In Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 31 , we tested the output of photovoltaic units connected in series and in parallel. In series connections, the Voc increased linearly with fiber photoanode numbers and the Isc remained constant. For the parallel connection, its Isc increased linearly with the number of fiber photoanodes, while the Voc remained constant. As shown in Fig. 4b and Supplementary Fig. 32 , each optimized Zn/MnO 2 battery fiber could reach up to a capacity of 190 mAh/g. Larger voltage and capacity could be achieved by connections in series and parallels, respectively. In addition, to prevent the self-discharge between the photovoltaic module and the battery module, the unidirectional blocking diodes were applied (Supplementary Fig. 33 ). For reducing the noise from the power supply to signal conversion, we introduced wire-shaped polymer dielectric capacitors with a capacitance of 100 pF (Supplementary Fig. 34 ) to form a typical capacitance filter circuit. As shown in Fig. 4c , a complete photo-rechargeable module can achieve 1.8 V beneath the sunlight, which could realize an 18 min continuous 0.1 mA electric power output.",

The power consumptions of each sensor module under stimulation or not are summarized in Fig. 4d . To give notable sensor responses on the body movements and sweating, both the motion and sweat monitoring modules required no more than 45 \u03bcW of power consumption. Moreover, the active light sensor could directly drive the transistor by harvesting solar energy with no power consumption. Furthermore, as indicated in Fig. 4e , the infrared emission signal of the wire-type LED reached up to 6-8 mW for seconds at stimulation and then dropped or stayed at the standby mode. Besides, wireless optical communication only reached its peak power consumption in emergency conditions. A textile containing a photovoltaic component of 3 cm \u00d7 5 cm and a battery fabric component of 2.5 cm \u00d7 5.2 cm, would continuously complete a set of tasks without needing to connect to an additional charger.",

It may be attributed to the low angle dependency of the wire-type infrared LED (Supplementary Fig. 35 ). As shown in Supplementary  Fig. 36 , after up 5000 cycles of bending, the wireless communication modules still functioned properly, which is very promising for on-body applications.

As indicated in Fig. 5a , we demonstrated a typical setup in the lab. A wrister-like intelligent textile without any wire connection was put on the arm.
