As positivity rose September-November 2020, rates were independently higher in younger ages, and those living in Northern England, major urban conurbations, more deprived areas, and larger households. Rates were also higher in those returning from abroad, and working in healthcare or outside of home. When positivity peaked December 2020-January 2021 (Alpha), high positivity shifted to southern geographical regions. With national vaccine roll-out from December 2020, positivity reduced in vaccinated individuals. Associations attenuated as rates decreased between February-May 2021. Rising positivity rates in June-July 2021 (Delta) were independently higher in younger, male, and unvaccinated groups. Few factors were consistently associated with positivity. 25/45 (56%) confirmed associations would have been detected later using 28-day rather than 14-day periods.",

We searched PubMed and preprint archives MedRxiv and BioRxiv up to 31 st August 2021 for epidemiological journal articles using the terms (\"coronavirus\" OR \"COVID*\" OR \"SARS-CoV-2\") AND (\"positive\" OR \"positivity\") AND (\"characteristic\" OR \"demographic\") AND (\"screening\" or \"monitoring\") without data or language restrictions. Most studies we found assessed associations of specific demographics and/or behavioural characteristics with SARS-CoV-2 to answer targeted questions, rather than assessing a broad range of characteristics. Further, data used was often not representative of the community, such as hospital admissions data, or those self-reporting infection. A process to monitor a large and broad range of demographic and behavioural characteristics, such as in the current study, are required to understand current populations at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

We describe key demographic and behavioural trends in a representative UK sample over a rapidly evolving pandemic, with emerging variants (including Alpha and Delta) and fluctuating control polices, including national lockdowns and the vaccine rollout programme. Importantly, the process presented in this paper allowed us to assess these trends weekly, meaning we could obtain regular estimates for key positivity associations. Using this process we found important independent associations between positivity and factors such as age, household size, geographical region, and working in health or outside the home during the rise of the Alpha variant (December 2020-February 2021), and sex and vaccination status during the Delta period (May 2021 onwards). Our methods allowed us to continuously monitor and summarise these associations over the study-period.",

Rapidly identifying groups where positivity is rising can help monitor spread of infection, aiding policy development and targeted advice to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission. For example, this could be used to target public health messages to detected groups to determine if that increased uptake of symptomatic and asymptomatic testing. Further, the methods presented in this paper are not limited to the demographics and characteristics used here, and could be broadened to incorporate both different exposures and outcomes, and could be applicable to different diseases. Using methods described in this paper, we were able to identify populations at increased risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in realtime, and monitor important trends across the UK.",

For example, identifying groups in whom newly identified variants of concern are spreading in the community may be vital in preventing widespread transmission. In England, since 26 th March 2020, there have been three national lockdowns, a tiered system 7 with varying restrictions in smaller geographical areas, and various other restrictions between these, 8 all affecting behaviour and risk of acquiring and spreading SARS-CoV-2. Finding societal factors or specific behaviours where these restrictions are less effective may aid policy development. With restrictions being relaxed in many countries, rapidly identifying groups where positivity is rising in real-time can help monitor spread and target advice.",

With large datasets containing many potential risk factors, multiple testing is inevitably problematic, 10 but standard approaches to building regression models restricting to smaller numbers of hypothesised associated factors risks missing true signals with a rapidly evolving pathogen and societal responses. The cumulative effect of missing data across many risk factors can mean substantial proportions of the original sample are excluded from penalised regression or backwards elimination, losing power, 11 and risking bias if missingness depends on outcome. 12 A method allowing numerous variable parametrisations of many individual variables would therefore be useful, provided collinearity and confounding can be avoided. 13 Using the Office for National Statistics (ONS) COVID-19 Infection Survey, a large community-based surveillance study, we therefore developed a process analogous to a repeated point-prevalence survey design with the potential to monitor groups with highest SARS-CoV-2 positivity week by week.",

In the first fortnight from 19 th July-1 st August 2020, we had no evidence that any characteristic impacted positivity. As positivity rose through September-November 2020, positivity was independently higher in those of younger ages, living in Northern areas of England, in major urban conurbations, in more deprived areas, and in larger households. Additionally, rates were higher in those who had recently travelled abroad, worked in healthcare roles, or worked outside of home. As positivity peaked December 2020-January 2021, while we still observed strong effects of living in urban areas and large households, there was a major shift in high positivity to more southern geographical regions (reflecting the emergence of Alpha), with risk no longer concentrated in younger ages. Those working outside of home and in healthcare roles still had higher risk. As the national vaccine programme rolled out from December 2020, we saw large reductions in positivity in vaccinated individuals. From February-May 2021 as rates decreased, the impact of work on positivity decreased, while the effect of vaccination remained. As the Delta variant became prominent and positivity rates rose mid-May through July 2021, we observed higher odds of positivity in younger ages, in men, and in those not yet vaccinated.",

Variation in positivity by region was well documented, 24, 25 as was increased positivity in nonwhite ethnic groups during September-November 2020, 24 and those working in hospitals and care homes during November 2020-January 2021, 26 but not as the Delta variant rose. 27 As well as demonstrating the increased risk of infection in those not vaccinated as Delta came to dominate, 28, 29 the screening process will facilitate continuous monitoring of waning vaccineassociated protection going forward. We were also able to monitor characteristics including behaviours and work, many of which affected positivity inconsistently over time. For example, between October 2020-March 2021, working from home was associated with lower positivity, whereas during June/July 2021 working from home was associated with higher positivity. As working from home was recommended during the former period, working from home likely preceded infection. In contrast, as returning to the workplace became encouraged from May 2021, working from home may have sometimes been a consequence of exposure and hence self-isolation, leading to a degree of reverse causality, and a higher risk of positivity in those working from home. Supporting this, imputing work characteristics with working outside home if reported in the 35 days before current visit removed the higher positivity risk in those working from home (Supplementary Figure 15 ). Interpreting associations contextually with current restrictions is therefore critical (see Supplementary Discussion for other significant effects).",

First, low event numbers and smaller sample sizes reduce statistical power, reducing the chance of detecting true associations (false-negatives) and increasing the likelihood that the magnitude of \"true\" effects are inflated (false-positives). 30 Increased statistical power using 28-day periods rather than fortnights more consistently detected associations with ethnicity in the core model and found more evidence of interactions. The screening process, however, detected the same characteristics using both time-periods, with earlier detection in most cases using fortnights. As there were no major differences and we aimed to identify associations most relevant to current positivity, the benefit of more regular estimates may outweigh the power gained from evaluating longer time-frames, although this will depend on event numbers. When events numbers are low, logistic regression can be biased and/or imprecise. 31, 32 Sensitivity analyses using penalised regression techniques showed most coefficients were within the logistic regression confidence intervals, suggesting that, while there was some attenuation of estimates, for example for geographical regions in a few fortnights, the logistic regression models were not substantially overfitting.",

            "text": "Multiple testing is an unavoidable limitation of our screening process. Doing many multiple independent tests increases the risk of false-positives; 33 however, a priori the questionnaire was based on potential risk factors so the \"correct\" degree of adjustment is unclear. We therefore used Q-Q plots with Bonferroni and Benjamini-Hochberg adjustments to monitor the potential for false-positives, rather than as strict thresholds. 34, 35 Even using stricter Bonferroni criteria, many screening variables were associated with positivity. Considering sex as a \"negative control\" (no effect expected), we only found an association in one of 24 fortnights before 20 th June 2021. The consistent association between sex and positivity from 20 th June-17 th July 2021 coincided with the European Football Championship, thus plausibly reflecting changes in social behaviour by sex, as observed elsewhere. 36 Our results suggest more emphasis should be placed on effects that appear at least twice, interpreting effects that are inconsistent or appear sporadically with caution. Conversely, to avoid missing effects of specific work sectors due to the large number of levels (16), we included each work sector as an individual binary effect vs all other work sectors. The underpinning design, namely a large community-based survey including randomly selected private households, is a major study strength. Participants being regularly asked about behaviours, work, and health status provided a rich opportunity to identify associations between positivity and many important demographic and behavioural characteristics. As participants were tested regardless of symptoms, characteristics could be assessed in an unbiased population, thus avoiding selection bias through only observing those choosing to take a COVID-19 test, for example, in the England national testing programme 37 or through presenting to hospital with severe disease. Data quality and availability of key socio-demographic characteristics are important considerations if extending the screening process to different datasets. The study design also had limitations, particularly with individuals tested initially at weekly and then monthly visits. Some cases of SARS-CoV-2 occurring between visits were undoubtedly missed; however, we chose to only use study PCR-tests as our outcome to avoid introducing bias from those seeking additional tests outside the study. As fragments of virus can be detectable in the respiratory tract long after onset of infection, positives included in our outcome include both new infections and lingering PCRpositivity. Associations from the screening process may therefore not necessarily be related to new infections. Whilst we could have grouped positive tests into \"episodes\", for example, considering only the first positive in 90-day periods, 38 we chose to mirror other pointprevalence studies, such as REACT, 14 also expecting that many characteristics would be reasonably stable over time and therefore even associations with ongoing PCR-positivity could still be relevant to the original infection. This may however dilute effects if participants with long carriage have different characteristics to those testing positive with new infections. Ongoing PCR-positivity may also reduce sensitivity to detect specific \"atrisk\" populations as new variants emerge.",
