On 5-point Likert scale, students \"moderately agreed\" (median = 4) that AI/M should be part of clinical psychology/psychotherapy education. Qualitative analysis of students' comments resulted in four major themes on the impact of AI/ML on mental healthcare: (1) Changes in the quality and understanding of psychotherapy care; (2) Impact on patient-therapist interactions; (3) Impact on the psychotherapy profession; (4) Data management and ethical issues.",

Psychotherapy apps have been designed to include various techniques including cognitive behavioral therapy, acceptance commitment therapy, and eclectic therapy. The recent coronavirus crisis has further accelerated the shift toward a model in which therapeutic relationships are increasingly mediated by on-line platforms and digital services.",

So far, a growing number of investigations have explored the views of clinicians including primary care physicians on the impact of AI/ML tools on their job (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . These studies, albeit limited, suggest that mental health clinicians expect AI/ML to influence or change their professional roles in the future. For example, in 2020, an international survey of 791 psychiatrists reported that 75% (n = 593) believed that AI/ML enabled tools would, at some point, be able to fully replace psychiatrists in documenting and updating clinical records (7) . In the same survey, 54% (n = 427) of psychiatrists believed that AI/ML tools will be able to fully replace humans in synthesizing information to make diagnoses. In qualitative research, psychiatrists express divergent opinions on the benefits and harms of AI/ML in treating mental health patients with comments demonstrating scarce reflection of ethical and regulatory considerations for patient care (6) . Similarly, in a recent survey of psychiatrists in France (n = 515) (8), respondents expressed \"moderate acceptability\" of disruptive technologies, such as wrist bands for monitoring symptoms, but concluded that this likely reflected lack of extensive knowledge about these technologies.",

This revealed very limited research examining attitudes toward artificial intelligence among students. So far, only one study has explored the awareness, and formal education of medical students about AI (9) . Our objective was to initiate research into psychotherapy and clinical psychology education by launching a pilot survey of students. Specifically, we aimed to explore whether clinical psychology students believed their career choice would be impacted by AI/ML, the benefits, and harms of any such impact, and their level of formal training on these topics.",

Courses should therefore encompass discussion about the evidence-based effectiveness and safety of mental health apps, as well as about other delicate ethical and regulatory issues related to privacy, equality, and discrimination.
