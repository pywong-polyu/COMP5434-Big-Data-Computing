            "text": "Bronchiolitis is one of the most common respiratory illnesses, affecting about 20% of the annual birth cohort and leading to 2-3% of the hospitalization rate in children younger than 12 months every year. Presentation occurs in epidemics, mainly following the prevalence of the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with higher rates from November to March, with slight variability through the years [1] . In March 2020, the Emilia-Romagna (E-R) region, Northern Italy, had one of the largest clusters of SARS-CoV-2 in the world [2] . Official up-to-date statistics show the number of total cases and deaths related to the virus, respectively, to be 4,153,374 and 124,063 in Italy (total population: 59,257,600), and 379,130 and 13,081 in the E-R region (total population: 4,450,500) [2, 3] . During the pandemic, a relevant decrease in the number of attendances to pediatric emergency departments 2 of 6 (PEDs) was observed in Italy during March 2020 compared with the same period in 2018 and 2019 [4] . Concomitantly, we witnessed a drop in hospitalizations for bronchiolitis to our PEDs, which occurred in advance of the expected end of the epidemic season. To date, several papers have described the reduction in the burden of common diseases, including bronchiolitis, during the SARS-CoV-2 era, focusing mainly on the overlapping end of the 2019-2020 bronchiolitis season with the so-called \"first wave\" of SARS-CoV-2 in March 2020 [5, 6] . Interestingly a strong reduction in the burden of common seasonal infections, including bronchiolitis, following the deployment of social distancing measures has been reported worldwide, despite wide variability in the population characteristics and in the severity of the restrictions considered. Data from Finland, often regarded as one of the European countries favorable to a less restrictive approach, describe an early ending of the influenza epidemic season, together with a strong reduction in the bronchiolitis burden as of March 2020 with the social distancing measures in place [7] . Similar findings have been outlined by Hatoun et al. in North America with a bronchiolitis diagnosis rate of 100,000 patients/day, decreasing from 20.1 to 0.6 after the general lockdown imposed during the first SARS-CoV-2 wave in early 2020 [8] . Conversely, to our knowledge, still no data on bronchiolitis epidemiology comprising the entire 2020-2021 epidemic season have been published. The aim of the present study was to assess the number of infants hospitalized in our pediatric emergency department (PED) with diagnosis of bronchiolitis during the ongoing pandemic, outlining any differences with previous years.",

Orsola Hospital is the largest Tertiary Pediatric referral Center in the E-R region, with approximately 24,000 admissions per year and serving a metropolitan area of more than 1 million people. Patient eligibility was defined through a hospital database search for diagnosis coded by the physicians at discharge according to the ICD (9th revision) (diagnosis codes 466. 11 and 466.19 ). Those with bronchiolitis, with or without RSV infection, were included. Only infants aged <12 months at hospitalization were enrolled in order to limit potential overlaps with other respiratory conditions. Hospitalization criteria were defined according to the most recently updated Italian Inter-Society Consensus for bronchiolitis [9] .",

The literature data support the effectiveness of similar restrictions that had already been deployed on a smaller scale during other pandemics such as the H1N1 outbreak (2009), when school lockdowns in Japan led to an estimated decrease in the number of students infected at peak by over 24% [10] . As our population comprised infants and thus, by definition, they not attending such facilities, the measures imposed are more likely to have affected the bronchiolitis prevalence in an indirect rather than a direct way. Indeed, there is strong evidence supporting the key role of having older siblings attending school as one of the most important risk factors for the development of infectious diseases, including bronchiolitis [1, 11] . Moreover, bronchiolitis is known to be caused mainly by RSV, the epidemiology of which is known to vary through different epidemic seasons. In order to address this possible bias, we included data from three epidemic seasons in our paper confirming a variability in RSV prevalence in our cohort (65.8-73.4%), coherent with the literature [1, 12] . Even if, in our center, RSV remained the most represented pathogen in those with bronchiolitis during the first phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic (March-April 2020), these data have to be read with regard to the severe overall reduction in bronchiolitis, which suggested a severe drop in RSV circulation.",

It has been well documented how the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has enhanced the perceived risk of gathering for hospital care, leading to an important decrease in the number of people seeking medical help. This reduction, similar to that described during previous outbreaks, such as SARS in 2003 [13] , is supported by data for the ongoing pandemic, depicting an even more severe drop in PED visits (73% to 88%) during March 2020 (compared with the same period in 2019 and 2018), with an increased risk of more severe presentations [4, 14] . In our population, this psychological factor seems to be less influential, since hospitalized patients with a defined diagnosis of bronchiolitis are, by definition, in need of in-hospital care now as before. Nevertheless, the proportion of patients on oxygen therapy was substantially similar during March-April 2020 and the same period in 2019 and 2018, ruling out any hypothetical selection for severe cases seeking hospital assistance possibly driven by fear of the hospital environment.",

Schools remained closed from 24 February 2020 until the end of the school year, and again between 1 March 2021 and 6 April 2021. However there has been wide variability, depending on the kind of school considered, with kindergartens and primary schools open for the most of the pandemic, while high schools implemented full distance learning or mixed distanced/in presence teaching [16] . As a consequence, we could speculate that since general lockdowns and school proscription for all age groups were maintained in Italy only for limited periods, our findings suggest a pivotal role for the milder NPIs such as the compulsory use of face masks and hand hygiene deployed for the whole duration of the pandemic. Evidently, any litmus test for these assumptions will become possible only once adherence to those measures fades.",

Further evidence is needed to confirm and better quantify this trend, as careful and systematic adherence to these basic and cost-effective NPIs could play an even greater than thought role in controlling bronchiolitis epidemics in the years to come.
