A myriad of public and state actors prescribe near constant physical activity as a marker of appropriate aging (Allain and Marshall, 2017) . The axiom \"move it or lose it\" has become the defining imperative of aging well, as common-sense ideology suggests that exercise keeps those in later life both physically and cognitively fit, and notably staves off the so-called care burdens associated with demographic aging or \"apocalyptic demography\" (Calasanti, 2020) . It is not hard to find popular investigate how older men navigate these contradictions in their social positions as hockey players. I will also explore how the place and materiality associated with physical activity mediate the men's understanding of themselves and their later-life physical activity, asking how their participation in the physical space of the hockey rink allows them to negotiate their own social positions in light of the aforementioned social pressures, pushing them to mitigate risk and invest in the present (Shimoni, 2018) . I will show that these later-life hockey-playing men focus on the pleasures associated with hockey, physical activity and relationships, eschewing discourses that position them and their activities as risky.",

The public, press, state, medical professionals, and various health organizations extoll the virtues of keeping fit and active, especially as one enters later life, describing it as the common-sense way to age well. For example, a discussion brief prepared for the Canadian government lists \"self-care\" as the third most important factor in \"healthy aging.\" For the Canadian government, self-care includes exercise and physical activity. The report's authors further link exercise to social connectedness and fall prevention (Healthy aging in Canada, 2020). The Government of Canada (2014) lists physical activity, along with healthy eating, injury prevention, oral health, and smoking cessation, as \"an important way for you to keep your independence.\" Similarly, the popular American magazine Real Simple finds \"exercising regularly\" fourth on a list of \"7 Habits of People who Age Well\" (Wise, 2020) . UK Active (2017) nicely sums up this common-sense perception regarding the benefits of staying active:",

While calling for sociologists to take age inequality seriously, she demonstrates that apocalyptic demography, although operating as common-sense, is based on distorted understandings steeped in ageism. Specifically, Calasanti shows that dependency ratios in the United States, which \"are meant to show the proportion of those in the population who are dependent per 100 working-age population members\" (p. 7), have stayed roughly the same or fallen over the last century (due to lower birth rates). She also highlights how dependency ratios ignore the important labor of those in later life, which includes providing childcare service for grandchildren, volunteering, and working in paid employment.",

She argues that from the mid-1980s until the early 90s, the press described aging populations, particularly the young-old (or third agers), as a risky population, presenting them as a potential social burden on the state. Beginning in the mid-1990s, this discourse changed, re-centering the third age as a more liberatory time and seemingly disrupting ageist assumptions about growing old. Instead, reporters placed \"an emphasis on the here and now\" (p. 47). However, these new attitudes about aging aligned with the neoliberal rationalization of the individual, as this discourse prescribed an investment in the self \"in order to reduce later risks\" and \"dramatically invest in the present\" (p. 44).",

The disavowal of pleasure not only happens within public discourse, but also, remarkably, within scholarly discourse (for example, see Fincham, 2017) . However, as Phoenix and Orr, 2014 have pointed out, pleasure is an important tool for rethinking and resisting neoliberal aging strategies. They argue that pleasure can take several unique forms, and can be sensual (pertaining to one's senses), documented (arising from keeping track of one's activities), habitual (generated through the act of regular participation), and immersive (produced through focus that provides escape from one's everyday lives). For Phoenix and Orr (2014) , being attentive to the varied forms of pleasure helps researchers understand the important ways that those in later life both engage with and resist neoliberal health strategies associated with active aging. Drawing from the work of Whitehead, they contended that \"pleasure seeking can form part of the reasoned, rationalized act of resistance against authority, including health promoters\" (p. 94). Thus, pleasure is an important tool of neoliberal disruption and one that critical aging scholars should be particularly attentive to when examining the lives of old(er) people.",

The limited scholarship on pleasure has frequently centered on health promotion, and how risky behaviours (e.g., smoking, recreational drug use, unsafe sex, poor diet) and those linked to pain (e.g., body-building) are often connected to feelings of pleasure (Conveney and Bunton, 2003; Monaghan, 2001) . Health promotion scholars have linked pleasure with opposition to the very activities that are thought to be healthy, ignoring the importance of studying pleasure in its own right. One notable exception to this is work by Jallinoja et al., 2010 , who examined how middle-aged Finnish participants connected notions of pleasure to their eating habits and physical activity. They found that research participants privileged pleasure, especially the pleasure associated with eating, as an essential part of their lived experiences. They concluded that health promoters need to consider pleasure as an essential component of any attempts at lifestyle change.",

Karen Throsby's (2013) autoethnographic work on marathon swimming in middle age illuminates how pleasure informs the process of later-life physical activity. Her recuperation of pleasure -particularly kinaesthetic pleasure (or pleasure connected to the senses and to being in the world) -allows for \"feelings of power and entitlement to space\" (p. 17). She explains that these feelings are important because \"they [are] at odds with conventional female embodiment -in particular, [her] own large, middle-aged body that is more likely to be overlooked or problematised (as overweight, and hormonally deficient) than celebrated\" (p. 17). Throsby's (2013) work also highlights how pleasure intersects (or plays within) physical space. For her, it is the unique sensory experience of being an embodied self in water that produces pleasure. In this regard, Phoenix and Orr (2014) find that research participants' sensual pleasure was deeply connected not only to their embodied positions but to their sensorial environments. Gilleard and Higgs (2013) describe embodiment as the ways the physical body is made meaningful in social life, a process that is deeply attached to social identity. Moreover, Phoenix and Orr (2014) argue that the pleasure of physical activity might be better conceptualized as a process that is not only embodied but also emplaced, as Throsby is emplaced in water. In this regard, they ask if it might be important to \"take seriously the sensuous interrelationships between body-mind-environment\" (p. 97).",

The interviews were conducted at a time and place selected by each research participant and were in line with the protocols of the St. Thomas University Research Ethics Board. I initially anticipated that all players would be over the age of 60 years. However, one player, Mark, requested to be included in this work, despite being 54. The players ranged in age from 54 to 74, with a mean age of approximately 65 years. All participants were white and most were middle-class, with all but two having completed post-secondary education. Fifteen of the eighteen participants were anglophone, while three were francophone -two Acadians (Jean-Charles and Raymond) and one Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (Fran\u00e7ois). All interview participants lived in Eastern Canada and played hockey in a small city in the region, noted for its aging population. 1 Although most of the men lived within the city limits, several lived in small rural communities outside the city. Because some of the hockey leagues that these men played in included rural teams, many players regularly commuted up to 45 min to play.",

However, the sport is played on ice, at high speeds, with sharp blades strapped to a player's feet. Given the physical intensity of the game, the potential for incidental contact at high speed with other players, and the likelihood of players falling down, many view the sport as risky, citing its capacity to lead to injury, disability, and even death, with various actors citing the risk of heart attacks as the most troubling aspect of later-life hockey.",

He stated, \"I think that a lot of people, (pause) they have a misconception that you're going to (pause) die on the ice.\" Some participants explained that their doctors and wives shared similar preconceptions about hockey and risk. 4 For example, Reg (62), a retired information technology (IT) worker, asserted that he wasn't worried about a heart attack, but \"my wife always says, 'don't get hurt' every time I go out the door [to play hockey].\" Reg's doctor also expressed concern about his later-life hockey playing. Reg recalled, \"I know when I hit 50, the first thing the doctor told me was, 'You better stop playing hockey.'\" Aligned with hegemonic or normative expressions of masculinity, which work to defy risk, pain and injury (see Connell and Messerschmidt, 2005; Kidd, 2013) , 5 the participants themselves downplayed the risk of hockey, despite popular discourse that might have suggested otherwise. They asserted that many other mundane activities were risky. Stacy (64), a humanities professor, poetically opined, \"By the time you get to into your sixties, the warranty on everything is almost off.\" Jim (65) reasoned, \"I think it's risky, but people can hurt themselves in curling too.\" For some participants, public fear about later-life hockey players was the result of too much publicity.

Jim described the balance between pleasure and the risk of pain, saying, \"Even though it [hurts], I don't mean pain. ..

That's sort of a fantasy death for me, is to just score a goal and then die. Monaghan's (2001) work has found that within bodybuilding communities, medical discourse used the language of risk to make transgressive bodies visible and impose normalizing judgements on them. In spite of this, the bodybuilders in his study, much like the older hockey players here, reframed these judgements, viewing their own bodies and actions in some ways as \"healthy,\" although the bodybuilders discussed health as an external body marker, while the hockey players privileged notions of health as internal. Specifically, some of the hockey-playing participants downplayed notions of risk, arguing instead that they themselves were not risky subjects, or they had taken the necessary precautions and self-care to mitigate some potential risks associated with playing hockey in later life. For most others, however, hockey was not conceptualized as a risky activity at all, but instead reimagined as an activity associated with pleasure, youthful vitality, and later-life health.",

Nor did they understand hockey as an activity that might contribute to later-life dependency (Katz and Laliberte-Rudman, 2005) .

Mark, who explained that his team regularly produced an online report about both the game and the locker room, stated, \"The dressing room environment is just as important as what you do on the ice.\" Later, he explained, \"I can't tell you how many times I've heard guys say, 'If it wasn't for the half hour before and the hour afterward, I wouldn't be playing hockey.'\" Although most players were careful to point out that there was little depth to their locker room relationships, the friendships forged there, through the participants' proximity and their shared experiences as aging hockey players, worked to facilitate this pleasure.

In spite of the fact that popular culture positions the sport of hockey as risky, potentially leading to disability and even death, this work explored the various ways that these men resisted this understanding. Hockey-playing men repositioned hockey as a healthy and fun 6 The baby boomers are the generation of children born directly following World War II (1946 II ( to 1965 (Statistics Canada, 2015) . 7 Sandy described a flow state as \"being fearless and being 'loosey goosey,' as Don Cherry would say.\" The American Psychological Association (2020) calls flow \"a state of optimal experience arising from intense involvement in an activity that is enjoyable, such as playing a sport, performing a musical passage, or writing a creative piece.\" activity, suitably appropriate for those in later life. Within the sport of hockey, older men found fun, pleasure and enjoyment. Importantly, this pleasure was not just located in any form of physical activity, but was emplaced both in the material objects of hockey (its skates, pucks, etc.) and its material space (the ice rink, the dressing room). This work importantly explicates four ideas. First, following from Phoenix and Orr (2014) , it demonstrates the importance of pleasure in producing acts of resistance to neoliberal health strategies. Interestingly, it was not the increasing pressures placed on the old to stay fit and active (Katz, 2005) that kept them involved. Instead, it was their love of the activity, the feelings of vitality, the pleasure they found in pushing their bodies, and the relationships they formed through playing hockey that kept them coming back. Second, playing hockey allowed these men to further resist aging stories that focused on physical decline, and instead reposition their later-life physical activity as better and more enjoyable than the sports they played when they were younger. These participants consistently emphasized the benefits of later-life hockey practice, positioning it as superior to the games they played in their youth. Their age allowed them release from hegemonically masculine sports ideals focused on individuality, competition and winning at all costs. This release not only increased the pleasure that these men found in the game, but also produced a more communal and convivial relationship to the sport. Many men, for example, commented on the joy they found in aiding other men to succeed on the ice and reach hockey goals that they might have not been able to reach without the aid of their teammates. In this regard, later-life pleasure allows researchers to imagine new and more principled ways of doing sport, ones that break with the normative gender and sport practices associated with younger life stages. Third, this work highlights how the materiality of hockey -its objects and spaces -produces these pleasures. It is the objects and spaces of hockey that facilitate this pleasure. Whether gliding on the ice, chasing a black disk, or joking with friends, the pleasure of physical activity was deeply emplaced in the material culture and associated spaces. This emplacement allowed these men to capture the nuanced ways that hockey, both in its social and physical actions, was connected to bodily pleasure. In this regard, Tulle's (2008) assertion that \"exercise should be reframed as a means of giving social actors the potential to renegotiate the meaning of physical competence, and particularly to bring out its more creative dimension\" (p. 346) holds true.",

This is especially important during the COVID-19 global health pandemic, which sees some Western nations call to \"cull\" the old and \"restart the economy\" (e.g., Newman, 2020; Roberts, 2020) . We need to examine the lives of the old -both the young-old and the old-old -as complex and dynamic, filled with needs, wants and desires. An examination that draws attention to the pleasure of being old disrupts neoliberal approaches to aging, especially those that see the old as a burden on the young (Calasanti, 2020) . In this regard, the emplaced pleasures of the old force us to reconsider common-sense ideas that suggest the lives of the old have no future (Sandberg and Marshall, 2017) , and instead generate aging futurities.",
