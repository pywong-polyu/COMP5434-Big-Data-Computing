            "text": "The 2010 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH) guidelines for acute paediatric services set standards for time to senior review for paediatric medical admissions in the UK as tier two doctor (registrar) review within 4 hours and consultant review within 14 hours. Our aim was to implement these standards in our unit through increasing proportions of reviews within these timeframes and measuring the impact on patient flow. Four quality improvement cycles were completed between March 2018 and March 2020 capturing data from 288 patient data sets. Recommendations included the extension of consultant on-site availability out of routine working hours (after cycle 1), highlighting patients awaiting consultant review during team handover (after cycle 2), and improving tier two doctor rostering (after cycle 3). After highlighting patients for consultant priority review, the proportion of patients seen within 14 hours improved from 53.3% (cycle 2) to 95% (cycle 3, p=0.005). Improved tier two doctor cover increased the proportion meeting registrar review within 4 hours from 82.9% (cycle 3) to 96.2% (cycle 4, p=0.028). A large proportion of paediatric patients were managed and discharged at tier two doctor level (65.6% over cycles [1] [2] [3] [4] . An inverse correlation was seen (R=\u22120.587) between time to discharge and the number of tier two doctors on shift (cycle 4). The interventions conducted demonstrated significant improvement in proportions of paediatric patients seen within the RCPCH timeframes. Adequate tier two doctor staffing is a priority for prompt review and discharge of acute paediatric patients. Future work aims to consider factors such as nursing rostering, bed management and the impact of COVID-19 on paediatric flow.",

Tier one doctors refer to doctors within foundation years (F1/F2 doctors) and in earlier paediatric training (Specialty Trainee years 1-3, also known as Senior House Officers) whereas tier two doctors have been defined as those equivalent to higher paediatric trainees (Specialty Trainee years 4-8, also known as Specialist Registrars, ST4-8).

This meta-analysis also found an increase in patient complications over the weekend in certain conditions. 5 These findings relate to the problem being tackled by this project through highlighting inequalities in paediatric outcomes for acute admissions which may be related to staffing levels, a factor which is explored through the interventions implemented through the PDSA cycles of this project.",

These findings support our understanding that with regards to roster planning, it is tier two doctor availability that has the greatest effect on patient flow, and with regards to consultant reviews this is more significantly determined by logistics of patient prioritisation. Although the proportion of patients being seen by a consultant within the recommended 14 hours has improved drastically since introduction of the consultant on-call extension, the majority of all paediatric patients are seen, treated and discharged without consultant input (65.6% over cycles [1] [2] [3] [4] .
