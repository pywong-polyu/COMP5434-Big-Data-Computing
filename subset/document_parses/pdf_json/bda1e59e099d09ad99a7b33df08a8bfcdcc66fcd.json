Based on an autoethnography of myself as a pregnant woman under Covid, I explore the extent of my being caught by the illusio-\"being taken in and by the game\" (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992) , that prompted me to remain absorbed by the publishing game and to overwork until the very last day before giving birth to my son. I also explore how the forced deceleration induced by the maternity leave as well as the Covid confinement contributed to increased awareness and reflection thus helping me to transcend the illusio that prompted me to overwork. I also reflect to the extent of this conversion being reversible given the continued pressures of the academic context.",

Increasing commercial and competitive pressures of business school rankings as well as a myopic focus on research outputs and other measures of performance accountability have led to an intensification of work in academia (Clarke et al., 2012; Fleming, 2020; Gendron, 2015; Knights & Clarke, 2014) . These studies point to how academics internalize these pressures and by complying with the rules of the game further increase their alienation and identity insecurity (Clarke et al., 2012; Knights & Clarke, 2014) .",

Nevertheless, as more recent research acknowledges, in spite of strong pressures toward conformity, employees have the means to resist and negotiate power relations instituted through discourses (Courpasson et al., 2012; Halford & Leonard, 2006; Meril\u00e4inen et al., 2004; Symon, 2005; Thomas & Davies, 2005) , even though resisting is not easy and there are often associated penalties (Lupu et al., 2020; Reid, 2015; Ruiz Castro, 2012) . With few exceptions (Michel, 2011) , previous research has not inquired into the circumstances that enable professionals to transcend socialization and thus resist to the urge to overwork by mobilizing an embodied experience, such as I intend to do in the present study.",

In these organizations, professional identity is constructed with reference to an ideal worker (academic), defined as \"someone who gives total priority to work and has no outside interests and responsibilities\" (Bailyn, 2003, p. 139) . Moreover, academics can never feel secure about their competence in as much as the ideal academic identity remains unattainable \"because the real or imagined demands LUPU of others invariably exceed the capacity of ordinary human beings to meet them\" (Knights & Willmott, 1999, p. 72 ).",

            "text": "Although many studies focus on workers' compliance with organizational norms, some studies indicate that dis-identification practices can take different forms: active-criticizing, negotiating, challenging, game playing (Hawkins, 2008) , passive-distancing, cynicism (Fleming & Spicer, 2003; Kosmala & Herrbach, 2006) . Some of these forms of resistance were criticized for functioning rather as coping strategies with institutional demands, not as material resistance (Karreman & Alvesson, 2009 ). The fact is that employees perform as expected, even if they do not agree with organizational values and norms, leaving the status quo intact. For as much as employees might question the status quo by dis-identifying with cultural prescriptions or making fun of organizational situations, they still act \"as if they believe in the culture of the organization\" (Fleming and Spicer, 2003, p. 169) . Prior studies point to how academics themselves internalize these pressures and by complying with the rules of the game fail to resistant to the oppressive demands for audit, accountability and performance (Boncori & Smith, 2019; Clarke et al., 2012) . A more recent and growing stream of research exploring typically feminine, embodied experiences such as pregnancy or motherhood (Boncori & Smith, 2019; Cohen et al., 2009; Gatrell, 2013; Herr & Wolfram, 2012; Huopalainen & Satama, 2019; Strau\u03b2 & Boncori, 2020) show how professional navigate and sometimes resist the masculine culture of their workplaces. For instance, miscarriage and the subsequent sharing of this intimate experience as an example of alternative writing can be used to challenge and resist dominant masculine discourse in academia (Boncori & Smith, 2019) . Another paper shows how women early career academics resisted dominant discourses by taking their babies with them to informal meetings at the university (Huopalainen & Satama, 2019) .",

First, illusio is a way of \"being in the world\" (Bourdieu, 2000, p. 135 ) characterized by one's investment (the opposite of indifference) that arises from being a product of that particular world. It means to be \"taken in and by the game\" (Bourdieu & Wacquant, 1992, p. 116) and it represents a psychological as well as a corporeal investment. As such, it differentiates those whose habitus embody the field from the outsiders who do not. Second, illusio can be understood as interest in the game, which Bourdieu explains as: \"games which matter to you are important and interesting because they have been imposed and introduced in your mind, in your body, in a form called the feel for the game\" (Bourdieu, 1998, p. 77) . Third, illusio is a principle of perception: it is that which is perceived as obvious and normal for an actor within a field, but appears as illusion to those outside the field. This experience is linked to one's belief in the stakes of the game which translates into a refusal to question its underlying principles. So illusio is at the same time investment, interest and principle of perception. It is a condition for the operation of fields.",

Autoethnography thus allows researchers to connect their everyday organizational experiences with a wider cultural, social, political and organizational context (Ruiz Castro, forthcoming). A reflexive use of ethnographic material encourages researchers to use memories and recollections to construct stories as close as possible to the remembered experience (Ellis & Bochner, 2000) . Reflexivity urges researchers to question or interrogate, not only the underlying assumptions of others or specific situations, but also the truth claims we make about ourselves (Cunliffe, 2003) .

My mum could not understand that although I was on maternity leave, I was still working so intensely. She kept telling me that I needed to move more that it was not healthy to spend so much time seated. I sat at my desk in the morning and I barely moved until dusk, focused as I was on my writing. I found myself completely absorbed in the struggle to finalize the paper and submit it before the baby was born. Baby's due date became my own, self-imposed submission due date.

As Bourdieu notes, participation in the game is \"visceral\" and \"unjustifiable\" (especially to outsiders), even if it can be rationalized post-festum (Bourdieu, 1997: 122-123) . The more you sacrifice to the game, the more the game becomes important to you, so while I was conscious at some level of the absurdity of the academic game, I found it difficult to not comply with it. I had sacrificed too much to this game in the last few years, first to obtain tenure, and then to comply to my school's exhortation to publish in top-tier journals even though I was lacking the resources in terms of training and network. However, I could not think from outside the game. I had become an embodiment of the academic game which played itself out through me, but often against me as overwork was damaging my relationships with my family who kept telling me that I was never there.",

Many of the people I interviewed had left those firms and some of the work-life balance policies had changed. I could not help asking myself how relevant were my findings after all this time?

On the contrary, as the Covid crisis was about to show, working from home was to become the new normal.

This alternated with moments of discouragement when I thought I was a mere imposter (Bothello & Roulet, 2019) , but these moments had the paradoxical effect of making me pursue even more ferociously the illusory stakes of the game. Third, the belief and adherence to the stakes of the game made me sacrifice things I cared a lot about such as time spent with my family. The concept of illusio has been a useful lens in this reflexivity process as it allowed exploring academic publishing as a form of game playing which colonizes the mind and bodies of those caught in it (Lupu & Empson, 2015) . My world was ordered by the research activities and interactions. Most of my time and energy were dedicated to them. The thought of a research idea or crafting a complex argument was often at the back of my mind\u2026and worse, I was judging my co-authors through the prism of their research involvement\u2026blaming them for not giving priority to their research. How did I end up so caught in the game and its requirements? Reflecting back on this question, it was a gradual process of socialization which happened with every paper I published, every little academic success I had conditioned me for wanting to achieve even more. A stay during the early years of my career in a top Business School taught me many things about how to publish in top journals. I had the opportunity to meet some of the best researchers in my field and to learn from them about doing research which gets published. However, in this process, I inadvertently got enmeshed in the illusio of the field and forgot what was important for me.",

Prior literature has shown that people can resist to socialization and culture which prompts them to overwork with negative consequences for their personal lives and health. While these papers show that workers' re-sistance has mixed effects and sometime ends up reinforcing compliance, I want to focus on contributing to an emerging stream of research which explores resistance to oppressive organizational practices through the body (Boncori & Smith, 2019; Huopalainen & Satama, 2019; Michel, 2011) . As socialization targets peoples' minds and the body cannot be completely socialized, in some conditions, it can become a means of resistance (Michel, 2011) . By exploring my embodied experiences of pregnancy and giving birth, I show how the forced deceleration induced by the maternity leave as well as the Covid confinement contributed to an increased awareness and reflxivity thus helping me to transcend the illusio that prompted me to overwork. A shock, such as the one of giving birth, was needed to break the veil of the illusio and to make me realize the extent of my being caught by the game. More importantly, it could happen because of the time off I had for my maternity leave. This allowed me to step back and to reassess my work commitment.",

In the context of the proliferation of managerialist controls of audit, accountability, monitoring and performativity, in order to be a successful academic, one has to become an \"ideal academic\". Ideal academics are expected to sacrifice personal time to their research activities which become their most important and noble occupation. But is that really so noble? In my experience, most research-driven academics (including myself) are individualistic and self-centered. They often sacrifice teaching and citizenship time for spending more time on doing research.",
