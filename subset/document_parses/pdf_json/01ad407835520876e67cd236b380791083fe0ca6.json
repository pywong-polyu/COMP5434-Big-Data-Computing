The virus detected in the last of 12 clinical samples (day 237) had accumulated 22 changes in amino acids and 29 in nucleotides. Some of these changes, such as the E484Q, were mutations of concern as defined by WHO. This finding represents an enormous epidemiological threat and poses a major clinical challenge. Combined antiviral strategies, as well as specific strategies related to the diagnostic approach of prolonged infections for this specific population, may be needed.",

In February 2020, the patient relapsed and began palliative care with cyclophosphamide and prednisone (PDN) cycles. On March 2020, she was admitted to the hospital for bilateral pneumonia with a total lymphocyte count of 200 cells/\u03bcL. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR was performed on a nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), testing positive with a Ct value of 14. The patient received lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) and hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) for 7 days and azithromycin (AZM) for 5 days, since it was the standard therapy at that time at our center, although is no longer recommended. On day +20, she was discharged without control RT-PCR testing. However, she presented a persistent, low-grade fever attributed to tumor progression and underwent treatment with PDN. On day +52, she was re-admitted to our hospital due to a persistent cough and worsening of fever. A chest X-ray showed persistence of bilateral pneumonia. RT-PCR of NPS tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, with a Ct value of 21 and positive sgRNA. SARS-CoV-2 serology was negative. An extensive work-up ruled out other possible causes of fever, and the patient received remdesivir for 10 days. The patient's health improved progressively, and she was discharged. Despite this treatment, RT-PCR of NPS remained positive and there were no significant changes in Ct values and sgRNA was positive. Receiving care on an outpatient basis, the patient presented a persistent dry cough and persistently positive RT-PCR of NPS. On day +139, she was re-admitted to our hospital for further study. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed persistence of pulmonary infiltrates. Serology remained negative. A new RT-PCR of NPS tested positive, with a Ct value of 24 and positive sgRNA once again. She received convalescent plasma and was then discharged. The patient presented mild symptoms, but RT-PCR of NPS remained positive while she received care on an outpatient basis. Eight months after the initial hospitalization, the patient was re-admitted again for COVID-19 evaluation. A chest CT showed mild ground-glass opacities (without significant changes). The serological analysis showed negative results, and again RT-PCR of NPS tested positive with a Ct value of 23 and positive sgRNA. At this point, isolation of SARS-CoV-2 was made from a NPS of in cell culture at +146 days. The patient then received a new dose of convalescent plasma. A month later, a febrile neutropenic episode elicited re-admission of the patient. RT-PCR of NPS tested positive again, with a Ct value of 24 and positive sgRNA. After these findings, the patient underwent a second course of remdesivir for 8 days concomitantly with a new dose of convalescent plasma. At the end of treatment, RT-PCR of NPS tested positive (Ct value of 19), as did sgRNA and the viral culture. The patient died in December due to lymphoma progression.

Before the analysis of mutations over time, to discard the possibility of SARS-CoV-2 re-infection was a need. The assignation of B.1 lineage using Pango lineage assignment tool in every sample from the patient, was the first clue to exclude a re-infection. The patient presented 6 nucleotide mutations and 2 amino acid changes from the reference sequence Wuhan-1 (GenBank accession number: NC_045512): C96T, C241T, G12769T, C14408T, A20268G, A23403G, being present in the 12 consensus sequences analyzed from the patient. According to the A20268G mutation, the nucleotide change produces a stop codon lost for a tryptophan amino acid. An analysis of all B.1 sequences published in Spain from March to December 2020 revealed the presence of this change only in the 27% of the samples (Supplementary Figure  S1 ). Supplementary Figure S2 shows the phylogenetic tree based on the analysis of B.1 complete sequences published in GISAID from Spain from March to December 2020.

The virus developed different ORF-1ab mutations, albeit all were located in the nsp3 gene. This protein has a major role in viral replication although it was not the target of any of the treatments administered to the patient. Of note, nsp3 includes the essential domain of SARS-CoV-2 protein PL2pro that plays a significant role in how the virus interacts with the innate immune system (Angeletti et al., 2020) . We also identified the T820I and K977Q mutations representing a change in the enzyme substrate preference diminishing the host's ability to recognize the virus. Both mutations were related with ubiquitin-like ISG15 host protein interaction. A glutamine in the 977 position was observed in the 2003 SARS-CoV Urbani virus strain (GenBank accession number: AY278741.1) suggesting that this change might be represented in commonly circulating Sarbecovirus with particularly affinity to evade immune system. Treatment with convalescent plasma was administered in July and November 2020. After that, progressive amino acid mutations in the spike protein were documented. Those cumulative mutations could affect the effectiveness of neutralizing antibodies. The spike structure showed different changes: (i) a signal peptide mutation, S12F; (ii) two changes in the N-terminal domain, T95I and L141F; and (iii) two changes in the receptor-binding domain, E484Q and S494. Due to the location of these changes, viral affinity for ACE-2 receptor and interaction with neutralizing antibodies could be compromised. Mutation T95I is also present in many Delta variants of concern (VOC) sub-lineages and in the Omicron VOC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2021). Mutation E484Q was first identified in variant Kappa (B.1.617.1) and in B.1.617.3 lineage (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2021). This mutation was defined as a mutation of concern by the WHO based on changes in the antibodies binding site Ib in the receptor-binding domain. Also, the mutation E484Q present in our patient is very similar to the 484A present in the Omicron VOC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2021) . Deletions detected, \u0394143/145 and \u0394143/144, located in the N-terminal domain, are considered recurrent deletions that present a disruption to antibody binding (McCarthy et al., 2021) , being the \u0394143/145 a deletion of interest of the Alpha VOC (European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control, 2021) . Since the patient did not present seroconversion, convalescent plasma could have played a role in the emergence of such mutations in the spike protein.",

Physicians treating severely immunocompromised patients should be aware of this potentially prolonged viral replication. Both the patient and overall public health face the risk of serious consequences. For instance, the patient may be ill for an extended time, thereby causing delays in medical care needed for baseline diseases. Additionally, the selection of virus able to escape from the immune system and neutralizing activity of antibodies generated by vaccines, or those with specific mutations that could confer resistance to antivirals may limit the capacity to control the pandemic. Implementing an aggressive approach that aims to diminish viral load at disease onset and employing appropriate public health actions appears to be of the utmost importance. Guidelines on SARS-CoV-2 treatment and transmission should outline specific recommendations for immunocompromised patients. Since RT-PCR targeting SARS-CoV-2 genes are not well related to virus viability (Zou et al., 2020) , it may be recommendable to consider the use of RT-PCR in identifying viral sub-genomic mRNAs, which is better correlated with active viral replication (Santos Bravo et al., 2021) , or viral culture as a follow-up criterion.",
