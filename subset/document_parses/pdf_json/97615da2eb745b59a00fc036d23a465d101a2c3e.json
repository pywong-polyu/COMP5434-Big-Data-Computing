Diagnostic accuracy of such predictors (e.g. maximum inspiratory pressure, minute ventilation, respiratory rate) varies considerably, perhaps due to limited agreement between these parameters and the underlying pathophysiology of weaning failure, in prolonged ventilated patients namely an imbalance between work of breathing and capacity of respiratory muscles [5, 6] . The mechanical power (MP) of artificial ventilation, the energy transferred to the respiratory system per time unit, is a chief determinant for the establishment of adequate gas exchange. Calculated MP, the product of the applied airway pressure and minute ventilation, may therefore serve as an estimate for the workload imposed on respiratory muscles when switching to spontaneous breathing, which is a crucial factor when evaluating patients' ability to wean from mechanical ventilation. In a recent study, MP normalized to dynamic lung thorax compliance, assessed immediately before the first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) upon admission to the weaning center, was independently associated with failure of prolonged weaning [7] .",

Moreover, discriminatory performance of the MP indices increased over the course of weaning, with maximum accuracy observed immediately before weaning completion. The concept of MP is relatively new and has been studied mainly in the context of acute respiratory distress syndrome, since calculated MP includes all ventilator-related variables (e.g. respiratory rate, tidal volume, inspiratory pressure) that, if inexpertly applied, may result in ventilator-induced lung injury [19] . In a previous observational study in prolonged mechanically ventilated, tracheotomized patients, LTC dyn -MP was independently associated with weaning outcome [7] , most probably because it agrees well with the pathophysiological basis of prolonged weaning, which is mainly perceived as an imbalance between load (equal to the MP generated by respiratory muscles necessary to provide adequate gas exchange) and capacity of the respiratory pump [5] [6] .",

However, this only approximates respiratory physiology, since an increase in pressure (despite increasing tidal volume) will probably not decrease P a CO 2 when applying an extremely high inspiratory pressure above the upper inflection point of the respiratory system pressure-volume curve, resulting in increased dead space ventilation due to regional lung over-distension [21] . Moreover, PI rs does not account for another phenomenon called pendelluft, which may occur during assisted ventilation with low pressure support, leading to increased inspiratory effort with pendular movement of gas between different lung regions, thereby decreasing CO 2 removal [22] . Nevertheless, our results suggest that PI rs is sufficiently accurate in estimating the MP generated either by the ventilator or by respiratory muscles necessary to provide adequate gas exchange, with the observed increase in diagnostic accuracy of MP indices over the course of weaning most probably explained by our therapeutic interventions, which aimed at improving respiratory mechanics and pulmonary gas exchange, leading to a fall of respiratory muscle workload below the individual fatigue threshold in successfully weaned patients. The observed correlation between specific MP and daily duration of prescribed domiciliary ventilation, which was necessary to sufficiently unload the respiratory pump, further indicates the utility of these indices in estimating respiratory muscle workload during self-ventilation.",

In general, these parameters are determined after a short period of spontaneous breathing (a few minutes after the beginning or at the end of a weaning trial) with or without minimal ventilator assistance. Several of these parameters showed only poor to moderate diagnostic performance in predicting weaning outcome (e.g. maximum inspiratory pressure [23] , respiratory rate, tidal volume, or oxygenation [24] ). Several attempts have been made to increase accuracy by combining individual parameters into integrative indices. Examples are the CROP [23, 24] , CORE [26] , Weaning [27] , and Integrative weaning [28] indices. CROP and CORE unify respiratory system compliance, (maximum) inspiratory pressure, tidal volume, oxygenation, and respiratory rate, thereby significantly increasing discriminatory performance in predicting the outcome of a weaning trial [25, 26] . However, assessment of some of these variables is complex (depending on patient's respiratory drive), and none of these indices account for the exponential relationship between pressure and power, and none have been validated in prolonged mechanically ventilated patients. In contrast, mechanical power indices (LTC dyn -MP and PI rs ) derive from a physical equation, have a sound pathophysiological rationale, and can be easily assessed during mechanical ventilation without disconnecting the patient from the ventilator.",

However, since development of hypercapnic respiratory failure is determined by an imbalance between work of breathing and respiratory pump capacity [5, 6] , one also has to consider the latter when judging a patient's ability to wean from prolonged ventilation. Several studies have assessed trajectories of respiratory muscle function in patients in intensive care, and the impact of this trajectory on mortality and ventilator weaning. While development of, and risk factors for, ventilator-induced diaphragmatic weakness are well described [29] [30] [31] , little is known about potential reversibility. In a physiological study, Grassi and co-workers demonstrated a correlation between mode of ventilation and changes in diaphragmatic thickness [32] . After early thinning during a short period of controlled ventilation, thickness and thickening fraction recuperated in about 50% of patients within one week after switching to assisted ventilation. Moreover, Jubran and colleagues showed that respiratory strength (assessed by maximum inspiratory pressure) was well maintained in prolonged mechanically ventilated, tracheotomized patients, and did not significantly change between hospital admission and discharge. They concluded that an increase in muscle strength was not the major determinant of ventilator detachment, but that reduced strength may be a factor in weaning failure [1] . Both studies indicate that in most patients respiratory muscle strength recovers early in the course of weaning (e.g. from the moment of switching to assisted ventilation), with weaning outcome mainly determined by the load imposed during spontaneous breathing, consistent with the present results. Nevertheless, prevalence and magnitude of respiratory muscle weakness related to ventilator-associated diaphragmatic dysfunction, bilateral phrenic nerve injury, or pre-existing neuromuscular disease significantly impact the individual fatigue threshold above which ventilatory failure occurs, consequently determining the diagnostic accuracy of MP indices in predicting weaning outcome.",

            "text": "Our study has several strengths. The broad range of medical and surgical patients included increases the applicability of the results. Threshold values and their (internal) validation were assessed prospectively, with the cross-validation technique providing a more thorough estimation of diagnostic performance and generalizability by reducing selection bias (compared to allocating patients to groups based on the time they entered the study). Both the index tests and the reference standard (P a CO 2 during spontaneous breathing) are objective criteria, further reducing the likelihood of bias when determining diagnostic accuracy in predicting weaning outcome. However, this study also has some limitations. Since this was a single-center analysis, external validity is uncertain, despite the broad range of patients we recruited. In addition, MP was calculated using a surrogate formula, proposed for pressure-controlled ventilation [12] . However, in a recent study this simplified, surrogate formula, working under the assumption of a perfectly squared delivered pressure wave, performed better than a more comprehensive formula, without the need for complex calculations [13] . Furthermore, 50.5% of all variables analyzed were recorded during assistedventilation. Since in a single patient the same inspiratory pressure and PEEP was applied during both a controlled and an assisted breath (in the assisted-controlled mode), leading to identical transrespiratory pressures, absolute MP simply depended on the resulting minute ventilation. In contrast, at a given inspiratory and expiratory pressure, LTC dyn -MP does not account for changes in minute ventilation when increasing tidal volume due to activation of the diaphragm on assisted-ventilation, potentially leading to a distortion of P a CO 2 and consequently PI rs .",

Future changes in clinical practice of tracheostomy weaning could involve weaning protocols including this new predictor in order to help clinicians in guiding the weaning process (e.g. to control the degree of daily extension of spontaneous breathing), with the aim of reducing weaning duration. Further studies are needed to confirm our results. ",
