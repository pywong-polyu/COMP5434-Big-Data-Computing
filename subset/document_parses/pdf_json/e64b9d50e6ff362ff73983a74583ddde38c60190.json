They also have the cunning ability to replicate rapidly and require minimal resources to survive. For these reasons, it is impossible to initially feel their presence or to predict the risks they present. Recently, it has been demonstrated that bioterrorism raises the specter of exposure to toxins by devising new deliveries by which BAs can be weaponized [5] [6] [7] . It has become apparent that BAs weapons pose a real and potentially immediate threat as they are relatively cheap to manufacture and employ, and they have tremendous potential impact as terror weapons [2] . These features make biological weapons attractive to rogue states and terrorist organizations. In this article we briefly describe the threat of biological weapons [5] [6] [7] .",

Unfortunately, one of the major drawbacks is that the time required for the microbial outgrowth is long and some bacteria obtained are not culturable, as a result of genetic mutation.

Nonetheless, these antibodies lack the stability needed to detect pathogenic species under harsh environments, and requires a one-to-one pairing of antibody-based sensors for each target to be detected. Whereas, nucleic acid probe-based techniques such as PCR can reach single-cell detection limits, they still require the extraction of nucleic acids and are limited in portability [21, 22] . McAlpine and coworkers developed a robust and portable biosensor for the detection of pathogenic bacteria that could impact water quality monitoring for bacterial contamination [23] [24] [25] . The particular interest of the developed biosensor was that it combined the natural specificity of biological recognition to label-free sensors providing sensitive electronic readout. Thus, McAlpine et al. reported the selective and sensitive detection of infectious agents via electronic detection based on antimicrobial peptide-functionalized microcapacitive electrode arrays [25] .",

In contrast, the membranes of plants and animals separate negative charges to the inner leaflet and contain cholesterols that reduce AMP activity [25] . The AMPs, linear cationic peptides such as magainins, are particularly attractive for microbial sensing applications because of their small molecular size and intrinsic stability [26, 27] .

            "text": "It should be repeated that electrical impedance measures the total opposition to a circuit or a part of the circuit presented to an electric current. Usually the impedance is the results for both resistance and reactance. It is important to remember that the resistance component arises from collisions of the current-carrying charged particles with the internal structure of the conductor. Furthermore, the reactance component is an additional opposition to the movement of the electric charge that result from the changing magnetic and electric fields in circuits carrying alternating current. Figure 4 .2 outlines the sensing platform. First, the AMPs are immobilized on the micro-fabricated interdigitated gold electrodes ( Fig. 4.2a) . It should be specified that magainin I contains a cysteine residue on the C terminus ( Fig. 4.2b) , which allows the facile site-specific covalent attachment to the gold electrodes. Next, the heat-killed bacterial cells are injected and incubated on the AMP-modified electrodes [25] . When, the bacteria are recognized by the AMPs, binding will ensue ( Fig. 4 .2c), causing the dielectric property to changes that can be monitored by a spectrum analyzer. Usually, the impedance is measured over a frequency range of 10 Hz to 100 kHz. Figure 4 .2d shows an optical micrograph of the device, which is made using standard microfabrication techniques.",

When, a blank device with no immobilized AMPs was also tested for comparison, it was found that there was no change in the impedance of the blank device without immobilized AMPs, upon exposure to various bacterial concentrations. Figure 4 .3a shows that at low frequencies, the different concentrations of bacterial cells have the effect of increasing the impedance in proportion to the number of cells present in the sample. As the frequency increases, the contribution to the impedance from the bacterial cells decreases, leaving only the dielectric relaxation of small dipoles including water molecules in the buffer solution to affect the measured impedance. Figure 4 .3b depicts the impedance change at a fixed frequency of 10 Hz. The variation in the impedance is directly proportional to the number of bacterial cells bound to the immobilized AMPs and manifested in a logarithmic increase with respect to serially diluted bacterial concentrations. Significantly, the detection limit of response of the hybrid AMP-microelectrode device to E. coli was found to be 10 3 cfu\u2215mL (1 bacterium\u2215\u03bcL). This lowest limit of detection appears to be limited by the presence of impedance due to the electrical double layer resulting from the electrode polarization effect at low frequencies.",

The selectivity was first investigated using fluorescent microscopy methods, by staining bacterial cells and optically mapping their binding density to gold films hybridized with AMPs. The discriminative binding patterns of immobilized magainin I to and the surface density of the various bacterial cells (all 10 7 cfu/mL) stained with propidium iodide (PI) nucleic acid stain are showed in Fig. 4 .5. In summary, coupling of AMPs with microcapacitive biosensors has resulted in the implementation of a portable, label-free sensing platform for the detection of infectious agents. The achievable sensitivity approached 1 bacterium\u2215\u03bcL-a clinically relevant limit-and the AMPs allowed for sufficient selectivity to distinguish pathogenic and Gram-negative bacteria, while retaining broadband detection capabilities [25] [26] [27] [28] .

The immobilization chemistry strongly depends upon the underlying SAW substrate with or without a guiding layer and hence on the chemical environment available. Gold surfaces, for example, allow the use of functionalized thiols, whereas quartz or SiO2 surfaces enable the use of various silanes [42] . Analyte-specific molecules (e.g., antibodies) are immobilized on the SAW device to catch analyte molecules (e.g., antigens) from the sample stream.

These unique advantages have allowed them to serve as multicolor or multiplexed immunoassays. It should be mentioned that in terms of coupling QDs to antibodies, the most common method reported in the literature utilizes biotinavidin interactions [48] . The avidin/streptavidin coated QDs are commercially available, while biotin-labeling of antibodies are usually prepared in-house. QDs presenting available carboxylic acids from their capping agents may also be covalently attached to the epsilon amine of an antibody's lysine residues by using EDC/NHS coupling chemistry [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . Alternatively, simple electrostatic interactions can be used depending on the overall protein charge at the pH of conjugation [48] . Goldman et al. used sandwich immunoassays for the simultaneous detection of four toxins: cholera toxin, ricin, shiga-like toxin 1 and staphylococcal enterotoxin B (SEB), in a single microtiter well, see Fig. 4 .9 [47, 48, 54] .",

Antibodies specific for each of the toxins coupled to a different color QD were then added to the microtiter well plate. The resulting signal from the mixed toxin samples was then deconvoluted using a simple algorithm. Similarly, QD-antibody bioconjugates were used to identify and differentiate between diphtheria toxin and tetanus toxin proteins which were nonspecifically immobilized onto poly-L-lysine coated cover slips and for the simultaneous detection of Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Salmonella typhimurium bacteria using different colored QDs as immunoassay labels [55] . Liang et al. applied QDs to miRNA microarray assays by using streptavidin QDs probes to label biotinylated miRNA targets derived from rice, see Fig. 4 .10 [53] . Initially, miRNAs were oxidized with sodium periodate to oxidize the ribose 2\u2032-and 3\u2032-hydroxyl groups into aldehydes. The resulting dialdehyde was then reacted with biotin-X-hydrazide resulting in biotinylated miRNA. This was followed by immobilizing the 5\u2032 amine-modified oligonucleotide probes antisense to miRNAs on the amine-reactive glass slides. The biotinylated miRNAs were captured on the microarray by oligonucleotide probes in hybridization. Quantum dots were labeled on the captured miRNAs through the strong specific interaction of streptavidin and biotin. As QDs have a high extinction coefficient and a high quantum yield, so trace amounts of miRNAs are easily detected with a laser confocal scanner. In addition as alternative, the colorimetric gold-silver detection method was used in which captured miRNAs were labeled with streptavidin-conjugated gold followed by silver enhancement. During silver enhancement, the gold nanoparticles bound to miRNAs catalyzed the reduction of silver ions to metallic silver, which further autocatalyzed the reduction of silver ions to form metallic silver precipitation on gold, resulting in a signal enhancement [53] . This process allowed straightforward detection of the microarray with an ordinary charge-coupled device (CCD) camera mounted on a microscope.",

This was far better than other dye-based methods and further obviated the use of amplification while allowing a semi-quantitative comparison of the amount of miRNA in different samples [53] . Figure 4 .11 displays a set of images for various concentrations of miRNA (21 nt siRNA) detected by QD [53] . It should be noted that the signals become gradually weaker with the decrease in miRNA concentration (Fig. 4.11a) . When the miRNA concentration was as low as 39 pM, the fluorescence signal could be detected, indi- cating that the lower detection limit of miRNA microarrays is at least 0.4 fmol. As shown in Fig. 4 .11b, the fluorescence intensity of the spots is linear to the model miRNA in a logarithmic fashion from 156 to 20,000 pM, and the dynamic range is about 2 orders of magnitude. This implies that this method can be used to quantify miRNAs with broad concentration range [53] .",

FRET has been extensively used in biophysical and biochemical studies to probe ligand-receptor binding and molecular structural changes [56] [57] [58] . In the following example, the authors incubated the dye-labeled DNA targets with biotinylated capture DNA probes, which were allowed to be conjugated to streptavidin QDs, only when the two DNA sequences hybridize. The resulting hybridization was then detected via FRET between the QD and the dye acceptor (Fig. 4.12 ) [54] . It should be noted that the additional background caused by the acceptor direct excitation is virtually eliminated through the choice of an appropriate excitation wavelength; this led to a 100fold improvement in sensitivity compared to single organic dye molecular beacon-based detection. This type of sensing schemes can also be amenable to use in a multiplex format. The narrow and symmetric QD emissions allow easy spectral ",

The ability to identify nucleic acid (NA: DNA or RNA) sequences is central in the deduction of the first hard NA sequence information, concerning a new or genetically modified pathogen [59] . It is important to develop assays that have the flexibility to respond quickly to new threats. For this reason, developing NA probes allow for the rapid and quick examination of the actual genetics of the target organism [59] . Once the NA sequence of a pathogen is determined, multiple short probes are synthesized that bind adjacent to each other along a specific sequence on the target NA [59] . Consequently, Petrovick et al. developed a novel assay that uses a single CANARY cell line that expresses an antibody against digoxigenin. Each of these probes is labeled with a single digoxigenin molecule. If these probes are added to solution containing the target NA sequence, the binding of multiple digoxigenin-containing probes produces a tight cluster of immobilized digoxigenin molecules, which will stimulate light production from the CANARY cell (see Fig. 4 .15) [59] .",

The excellent combination of speed and sensitivity of the CANARY system was demonstrated with cell lines expressing an antibody specific for the F1 antigen of Yersinia pestis (Yp), shown in Fig. 4 .16 [59] . When concentrated in the centrifuge luminometer, as little as 45 cfu of formalin-inactivated Yp are detected. However, there was no response to relatively large numbers of F. tularensis [59] .",

This primer labeling method is convenient when amplification is needed for detection, or when it is used to construct a cDNA library from a genomic RNA pool via reverse transcription. In addition, the derivatized fiber core experiments are able to detect unlabeled (non-fluorescent) target solutions 74]. This is achieved by competitive hybridization with fluorescent target samples. In this method, the fluorescent synthetic target complements are synthesized and initially hybridized to the array to saturate the array probe elements [68] . The unlabeled target solution is then hybridized to the same array, competing with the prehybridized synthetic targets. The presence of unlabeled target is determined by a fluorescence decrease caused by displacement of the fluorescent synthetic target by the unlabeled species. This procedure eliminates the need to incorporate fluorescence into the target and allows quantitative measurements to be performed.

This oscillation, in turns, generates an electric field whose range is around 300 nm from the boundary between the metal surface and sample solution [76, 79] . In a commercial SPR biosensor configuration, the incident light employed is generated by a high-reflective index glass prism of the Kretschmann geometry of the attenuated total reflection (ATR) method (Fig. 4.20 ) [79] .",

In addition, it should be noted that when the surface of the sensing material has been coated through biomolecule attachment only, there will be perhaps an unnoticed small change in the reflective index of the sensing medium, and as a result, the plasmon oscillation cannot be formed ( Fig.  4 .20c, left side) [79] . However, when the metal surface has been coated with an analyte-biorecognition couple of biomolecules, detection is accomplished by measuring the changes in the reflected light obtained on a detector (Fig. 4 .20c, right side). In addition, the amount of surface concentration can be quantified by monitoring the reflected light intensity or tracking the resonance angle shifts. Typically, an SPR biosensor has a detection limit of 10 pg/mL [76] [77] [78] [79] .",

In SPR experiments, resonance or response units (RU) are used to describe the signal change, where 1 RU is equivalent to a critical angle shift of 10 \u22124 degree [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] .

In SPR imaging, the incidence angle remains fixed, and the binding of biomolecules on a gold surface is measured as the change in reflectivity (or reflectance) in relation to the incident ray intensity, unlike SPR sensors that depend on the measurement of the absorption dip in the SPR angle or SPR wavelength [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] . Recently, it was shown that SPR imaging technology using a multi-analyte biosensor allows the measurement of a high-throughput approach, and it achieves a similar degree of sensitivity of conventional SPR biosensors ( Fig. 4 Consequently, SPR imaging systems without any labeling requirements can be used for high-throughput screening (HTS), particularly in drug discovery, than any other optics-based detection techniques [83, 84] .",

These steps involved the stabilization of the baseline, the activation of carboxyl groups on the CM5 chip, and converting them into activated carboxymethylated groups on the sensor chip for future bounding to the free amino groups of BoNT/A antibody. This was followed by washing with PBS and measuring the SPR angle that has shifted nearly to the baseline [85] . When the BoNT/A antibodies are injected on the CM5 chip an increase in SPR angle was observed. Finally, washing with 1000 mM ethanolamine was performed to prevent non-specific binding and to block the unreacted NHSester groups on CM5 chip. ",

In this chapter, we have discussed the following subjects: impedance spectroscopy, evanescent wave technology and internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) excitation, surface acoustic wave sensors, fluorescent biosensors, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET), light emission (CANARY), microsphere-based fiber optic biosensors, and surface plasmon resonance. It should be noted that although fluorescence detection is the most popular, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based immunoassay formats with surface imaging capabilities are growing in popularity [ [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] . Multiplexing, or simultaneous detection of multiple analytes, is one of the most important prerequisites for biothreat agent detection. As mentioned in our introduction, the presented work is more a \"Comptes Rendus\" and an introduction to this series of sensing measuring devices used for the detection of biological warfare agents that were presented to the participants of this NATO-ASI meeting.
