Little is known about the experience of elder abuse, discrimination, loneliness, and health among older women, in particular in the era of COVID-19 when our lives have been changed drastically. Using two waves of survey data (n = 1,498), this study compared the estimates of elder abuse and age discrimination before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, examined their associations with physical and mental health, and explored the mediating effects of loneliness on the associations in two independent samples of older women in Hong Kong. Reductions in some forms of abuse and discrimination against older women during the pandemic were observed. Findings from regression analyses show that elder abuse and age discrimination were associated with poorer health, and these associations were mediated by loneliness.",

To date, violence against women, which affects one in every three women and causes lifelong harm to their health, remains an international health concern (World Health Organization, 2018). Governments, professionals, and other stakeholders worldwide have been making efforts to combat the problem in recent decades. For example, the World Health Organization has endorsed the global plan of action to urge its member states and international partners to take actions to address the issue under different strategic areas (World Health Organization, 2016) . Despite the growing effort in the world to end violence against women, there is far less attention on violence against older women.",

Findings from meta-analyses show that older women are more likely to be abused than men, and such gender inequality is especially obvious among non-Western populations than their Western counterparts (Ho et al., 2017; Yon et al., 2017) . Longer life expectancy of women in conjunction with deterioration in cognitive and functional capacities with age (Roberto, 2016) , greater vulnerability due to social norms and social roles that support violence by men (Stark & Seff, 2021) , higher likelihood to live with the perpetrator (Acierno et al., 2009) , as well as greater risks of domestic violence victimization throughout life (Mitszjurka et al., 2016 ) may contribute to the link between elder abuse and female gender.",

Age discrimination may occur equally in both genders; however, older women are often expected to experience more disadvantages than older men. For example, older women workers disproportionally face greater risks of job loss due to automation and technological change (World Health Organization, 2021b). Gender-based age discrimination in various aspects such as employment and caring responsibilities has been believed to be one of the causes for older women's vulnerability. Women who have experienced discrimination are demonstrated to have significantly lower income and a greater risk of poverty, leading them to face greater challenges and inequalities in old age (Birtha & Holm, 2017; World Health Organization, 2021b) .",

The disease has spread rapidly, affecting more than 220 countries and regions and causing over 4.3 million deaths as of August 13, 2021 (WHO, 2021d . The COVID-19 pandemic has had devastating impacts on older individuals. Despite the similar risk of contracting COVID-19 across age, older persons, especially those with comorbid conditions such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes, are more prone to severe illness and higher mortality (Gencer, 2020) . Risks of mortality greatly increase among older persons aged 50 or above: the infection fatality ratio increases from 0.01% to 0.14% among individuals aged 50 years or above, and jumps to 5.6% in the population older than 65 years (Mallapaty, 2020) . It has been estimated that approximately 80% of COVID-19-related deaths are older adults (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2021). Currently, disease prevention strategies, including social distancing, quarantines, lockdowns, and social and movement restrictions, are still widely implemented in many countries to protect vulnerable groups.",

Social distancing and confinement during the pandemic can be examples of the risk factors leading to violence in domestic settings. On one hand, social distancing restrictions can be of vital importance to stop the spread of COVID-19; on the other hand, they inherently limit one's physical activities and promote social isolation, which may potentially lead to the detriment of health (Holmes et al., 2020) . Although all ages can be affected, the impacts of these restrictions on social isolation and loneliness can be greater among older persons (Rina et al., 2020) . To avoid infection, older persons are often requested to stay at home. Due to the restrictions on social gatherings, suspensions of in-person social services, and closures of facilities, they may have very limited contact with family, friends, neighbors, and other significant others during the pandemic. Older persons, who are forced to struggle with social isolation and loneliness, are at risk of depression, anxiety, declined cognitive functions, poor immunity, and poor physical health (e.g., Elovainio et al., 2017; Holt-Lunstad et al., 2015; Shankar et al., 2013) .",

Although staying at home may minimize the risks of contracting COVID-19, for victims of elder abuse this restriction can be equal to confinement in the place where physical, psychological, and sexual violence occurs (Bradbury-Jones & Isham, 2020) . During the pandemic, not only may victims of elder abuse be trapped with the potential perpetrator(s) at home, but they may also find it harder to reach out to trustable figures in a safe manner. In this case, detection and service provision can be extremely challenging (Elman et al., 2020) .",

According to a recent report by WHO (2021c), the pandemic has exposed ageist prejudice and stereotypes against older persons due to the discriminatory practices in access to different critical resources and services. Similar to elder abuse, age discrimination can inflict pervasive and harmful effects on physical and mental health among older persons (Chang et al., 2020) . It is noted that age discrimination can be a worrying issue when ageist thoughts inspired by the COVID-19 restrictions exacerbate as the consequences of necessary social restrictions increase, leading to unjust utilitarian beliefs that the needs of the many should outweigh the needs of the few .",

As one of the first to compare the prevalence of elder abuse and age discrimination before and during the COVID-19 pandemic empirically, our findings show some consistency with previous studies. For instance, consistent with previous research (e.g., Lindert et al., 2013) , psychological abuse was the most prevalent form of elder abuse, followed by financial or economic abuse and physical abuse. We observed past-year rates of 0.4%-2% for physical abuse, 16%-20% for psychological abuse, and 1% for financial abuse, which were comparable to those reported in the Table 3 . literature. In a systematic review and meta-analytic study on elder abuse, the pooled prevalence estimate of 52 studies across 28 countries was 3% (2%-4%) for physical abuse, 12% (8%-16%) for psychological abuse, and 7% (5%-9%) for financial abuse (Yon et al., 2017) . Apart from elder abuse, age discrimination was also commonly experienced by older women in Hong Kong. Although the overall rates revealed here (7%-19%) were comparatively lower than that estimated by the WHO (>30% among all ages, WHO, 2021a WHO, , 2021b WHO, , 2021c WHO, , 2021d , current findings indicated that at least one in every five older women suffered some form of elder abuse or age discrimination in the past year, highlighting an alarming severity of this global health problem in the city.",

Based on previous findings (Elman et al., 2020; Weissberger et al., 2020) , it was expected that social isolation and confinement at home during the pandemic would turn home into a potential venue for greater risks of violence against older women. Yet, results in this study provided some evidence for a possible reduction in elder abuse and age discrimination despite the changing societal context. In line with current findings, a preliminary observational study of emergency department admission data demonstrated convergent results that admission due to physical domestic violence declined by 48% during the pandemic (Muldoon et al., 2021) ; another crime report study in Australia revealed a lower crime figure in March 2020 when compared with the figure forecasted with the crime data from February 2014 to February 2020 (Payne et al., 2020) .

            "text": "reported cases rather than a reality, or the complexity of the issue. During the pandemic, individuals were often advised to stay at home to prevent the spread of the virus. In the case of violence in domestic settings, the presence of family members other than the perpetrator(s) may reduce the likelihood of violent incidents against older women and protect them from abuse. In cases where the abuse victims and perpetrator do not live in the same household, social distancing restrictions, lockdowns, and stay-at-home orders could result in limited direct contacts with potential perpetrator(s), leading to a reduction in violence. Another possible reason for the reduction in elder abuse during the COVID-19 pandemic may be greater informal social control of violence by family members and neighbors. Informal social control, which refers to the reactions of ordinary individuals to achieve order and protect the weak, has been demonstrated to help reduce crimes and violence, including child maltreatment (Emery et al., 2015) and intimate partner violence against women (Emery et al., 2015 ). Yet, it should be noted the decreasing trend of elder abuse and age discrimination against older women might not indicate a true reduction in violence and requires ongoing monitoring. As one of the most hidden types of violence, elder abuse in domestic settings has consistently been underreported (Lifespan of Greater Rochester Inc. et al., 2011) . Before the pandemic, it was estimated that only one in every 24 cases of elder abuse was reported (Amstadter, Cisler, et al., 2011) . The situation might happen for the worse when older women are trapped at home with perpetrator(s) of violence . Victims might be unable to articulate the assault as they are isolated and fail to reach out to others to seek help due to the social and movement restrictions (Elman et al., 2020) . In this sense, the reduction of elder abuse during the pandemic might only reflect the increased severity of underreporting. Undoubtedly, social and healthcare service providers should interpret the current findings with caution, so as to avoid overlooking any victim of elder mistreatment in the future.",

These findings are consistent with literature that shows that elder abuse is a risk factor for various adverse health outcomes (e.g., Allen, 2019; WHO, 2021b; Yunus et al., 2017) . In a population study in New Zealand (Yeung et al., 2015) , elder abuse was shown to predict poorer physical health, mental health, and health-related quality of life, with effect sizes ranging from 0.26 to 0.70. Similar associations have been demonstrated between age discrimination and health, and the WHO global report on ageism has highlighted the negative consequences on health among older persons (WHO, 2021a (WHO, , 2021b (WHO, , 2021c (WHO, , 2021d . For example, ageism is linked to poor physical and mental health in general, poor sexual health, cognitive impairment, depression, risky health behaviors, and even early death. It is noteworthy that, despite the well-documented negative health consequences of elder abuse and ageism, the associations might not necessarily be unidirectional. Instead, some researchers have suggested that abuse and poor health could form a vicious cycle: abuse might hamper physical and mental health; and poor health might lead to various risky health behaviors and greater dependence on others which could further increase the risk of future abuse (Chmielowska & Fuhr, 2017) .",

In other words, it might be the feeling of loneliness aroused by the abuse and discrimination incidents that is directly associated with the poor physical and mental health perceived by older women. It has been pointed out in a review that loneliness, as distinct from social isolation, solitude, and living alone, could induce harmful effects on elderly health (Ong et al., 2016) . Loneliness is associated with adverse health behaviors (e.g., reduced physical activity and alcohol dependence), sleep impairments (e.g., shorter sleep duration), biological dysregulation, and negative social cognition, which are key mechanisms underlying its impacts on hampered health and increased mortality.",

Lockdowns, social distancing policies, and stay-at-home orders might lead to social isolation and reduced social support among older women, who have been advised to stay at home because of their greater mortality and morbidity related to COVID-19 . In Hong Kong, social distancing measures such as restrictions on group gathering and closure of facilities have been implemented since 2020. Older women are prone to a reduction or a loss of social connection. The objective deprivation of social life might then exacerbate the subjective feeling of loneliness, which may have detrimental effects on both physical and mental health among elder abuse victims (Kasar & Karaman, 2021) .",

Before the COVID-19 pandemic, psychological interventions including home visits and cognitive behavioral therapies have been shown as effective in reducing loneliness in older persons (Ong et al., 2016) . However, during the pandemic, services might not be delivered in a face-to-face approach, and the mode of support to reduce loneliness may need to change. In recent years, there have been efforts in developing interventions assisted by digital technology for older persons (Masi et al., 2011) . Digital technology interventions may involve mobile apps, robots, sensors, and internet-based social networking tools (Pu et al., 2019) . Studies have provided preliminary evidence supporting their effectiveness in reducing loneliness; however, a recent meta-analysis has shown that the effectiveness might be weak (Shah et al., 2021) . Clearly, there is a need for more age-friendly technology-assisted interventions that are effective for reducing loneliness among older persons in the era of COVID-19.",

In line with previous research (Huang et al., 2020) , a lower level of financial strain was associated with better self-perceived physical and mental health. The associations between financial health and well-being can be both direct and indirect: On one hand, better financial health may imply better resources to promote health in general; on the other hand, financial status may have some extra indirect effects on seniors' health as financial instability could be a risk factor for family conflicts and violence (Chang & Levy, 2021) . Researchers have suggested that perceived financial strain reported by older persons might reflect the financial instability of the family as a whole, and the overall financial instability could increase the risk of caregiver stress, rendering older persons vulnerable to abuse. The link between financial status and health among older adults may give valuable insights especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, where income instability and financial strain could be alarming issues in the community. Current findings may shed light on the importance of promoting both objective financial stability and subjective financial security so as to foster well-being among older persons.",

            "text": "This study had several limitations. A major limitation was that we extracted data from a large survey study and based our analysis of change in elder mistreatment rates on different cross-sectional surveys instead of on the same group of older persons over time. Yet, the two waves of the sample used in this analysis were recruited and surveyed with the same data collection procedures and the same research protocol, and the multilevel sampling methods did maximize the representativeness of the samples. Although this study was not able to compare the changes in elder mistreatment over time at the individual level, findings did provide important insights into the changes before and during the pandemic at an aggregate level. Another limitation related to the dataset was the failure to include more variables in the regression models. As data were extracted from a larger study, we had no control over the variables to be assessed. It could be meaningful to include variables such as social support, health behaviors, and morbidity related to COVID-19 in the model explaining elderly health during the pandemic. The use of single items to measure self-perceived physical, mental, and financial health in this study might be subject to self-reporting biases, which limited the interpretation of the current results. Self-perceptions might not always accurately reflect actual situations in reality. Yet, there is also evidence that supports the reliability and validity of single items assessing health, particularly in large-scale surveys (Bowling, 2004) . Finally, the use of telephone surveys to collect data may lead to biases in the sample recruited. As one of the inclusion criteria was the ability to communicate in Cantonese, older women with cognitive impairments might be excluded due to difficulties in communication. Older persons with cognitive impairments (e.g., dementia and Alzheimer's disease) are often believed to be more vulnerable to abuse (Cooper & Livingston, 2020) , and exclusion of this group of older women might inevitably lower the rates of elder abuse and age discrimination. Future research may consider the inclusion of older persons with cognitive impairments with the use of proxy reports.",

However, current findings show that across time rates of elder abuse and age discrimination against older women were high, indicating that a large number of women were facing challenges to enjoying their full human rights. Despite the possible reduction in elder mistreatment during the pandemic, the reality and reasons behind this change should be further examined. The significant mediating role of loneliness in the associations between elder mistreatment and hampered health, together with the potential protective function of good financial health, sheds light on the need for the development of effective interventions to end violence against older women in the future. Older women may benefit from continuous support to reduce the risk of negative health outcomes. Professionals, policymakers, and service providers should examine innovative intervention approaches for the reduction of loneliness in the event of future pandemics.",
