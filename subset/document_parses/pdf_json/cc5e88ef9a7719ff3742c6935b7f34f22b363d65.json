The disease itself has been named coronavirus disease 2019 or COVID-19 [1] . While most attention focused on the management of COVID-19, the worldwide burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pushes modern medicine silently back to a pre-antibiotic era. A recent report by the United Nations warned that without adequate response, AMR would lead to more than 10 million deaths per year by 2050. Death from AMR could become the primary cause of death worldwide, possibly leading to an economic crisis worse than that of 2008 [2, 3] . It is still unclear to what extent the COVID-19 pandemic will have a deleterious impact on AMR. However, different authors have highlighted the fact that routine antimicrobial stewardship efforts and infection prevention measures were downgraded because of a shift of activities, which was caused by COVID-19 [4] .",

However, overall antibiotic prescribing has been high. In the beginning of the pandemic, Zhou et al. described that 95% of patients were treated with antibiotics [8] . In an international survey investigating antibiotic prescription patterns, 71% of the respondents reported to prescribe antibiotics for patients with COVID-19 admitted to a regular ward [9] . A recent systematic meta-analysis of 254 studies by Langford et al., reporting on 30,623 patients, found that almost three-quarters (74.6%) of patients with COVID-19 received antibiotic therapy [7] . This raises several issues relating to antibiotic prescribing in patients with COVID-19. First, overuse and misuse of empiric antibiotics can lead to an underestimation of real co-infections [10, 11] . Second, antibiotic overprescribing in general has been associated with adverse events and worse outcomes. Third, antibiotic overconsumption is problematic in light of global antimicrobial resistance (AMR) [3] . Reports on nosocomial infections in COVID-19 include clusters of vancomycin-resistant enterococci [12] and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamaseproducing Enterobacterales [13] or carbapenemresistant Enterobacterales [14, 15] .",

All adult patients admitted to the COVID-19 ward between 1 May 2020 and 2 November 2020 in the context of a (suspected) COVID-19 infection were eligible for inclusion. Included patients, or their legal representative, were required to sign an informed consent form (ICF). Patients eligible for inclusion had to be admitted for at least 24 h before inclusion. A COVID-19 confirmed infection was diagnosed either by clinical suspicion with positive SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on nasopharyngeal swab or by clinical suspicion together with strongly suggestive chest computed tomography (CT) scan. For the COVID-19 cases confirmed by PCR, the timing of COVID-19 confirmation was documented as 'early' (a positive PCR result in ambulatory setting or a positive rapid PCR test performed at the emergency department) or 'late' (PCR test result available after admission on a ward). For participants in whom the diagnosis of COVID-19 was eventually rejected by SARS-CoV-2 PCR on nasopharyngeal swab and/or on clinical grounds, the follow-up period continued until the moment of rejection. Data were extracted from the patients' electronic medical file following a structured registration method. These data include baseline demographic data, comorbidities, information related to the patient's hospital stay (e.g. length of stay and survival), symptoms, laboratory results, severity of COVID-19 (amount of oxygen needed, mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) hospitalization), microbiological data and antibiotic use data. Radiological data were reassessed retrospectively by a thoracic radiology specialist. Definitions used for fever, Mycoplasma pneumonia infection and calculation of oxygen need can be found in the supplementary material. If participants were to be admitted to ICU, data collection stopped during the ICU admission. A graphical presentation of patient inclusion and follow-up is shown in Fig. 1 .",

First, the daily defined dose (DDD) was calculated, as proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [22] , both for single antibiotic formulations as well as for the total amount of administered antibiotics. The DDD is a commonly used technical measure to visualize and compare cross-national antibiotic consumption. This measure can also help surveillance organizations to assess antibiotic prescribing in a longitudinal way [23] . DDD per admission and per 100 days of admission are reported as complementary indicators. DDD per admission is indicative of the selection pressure and DDD per 100 bed days is indicative of the therapy duration [24] . Analyses of the quantitative endpoints were performed separately: on the one hand for the total group of patients (including the group with rejected COVID-19 diagnosis until the time of rejection); on the other hand for the group of patients with confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis. Second, the appropriateness of the antibiotic(s) was scored daily by an expert panel of ID specialists and every antibiotic categorized as 'appropriate', 'inappropriate', 'suboptimal' or 'unnecessary' by at least two independent ID specialists (see supplementary material) [25] . In case of disagreements between them, a third ID specialist was consulted in order to reach a consensus. Whenever indicated, written and oral antimicrobial stewardship advice was communicated to the treating physician as part of the standard AST activity.",

            "text": "To date, prospective studies on antibiotic prescribing in patients with COVID-19 are scarce [7] . Reporting DDDs next to a qualitative [6] . Although the presence of a superinfection has been associated with a prolonged hospital stay, a higher mortality rate and different respiratory bacterial species, the pathophysiological mechanism of both entities has not been described separately, making it an artificial subdivision [11, 29, 30] . In patients with COVID-19, superinfections seem to be more frequent than co-infections, accounting for 70% of the infections in the ISARIC study [31] . Based on the timing of antibiotic prescribing, our study found an opposite trend, with 41/55 (75%) of the antibiotics started during the first 2 days of admission, assuming that antibiotics were initiated in the context of a presumed coinfection. However, our study did not include ICU admissions, where mechanical ventilation, a prolonged length of stay and nosocomial transmission play an important role in the pathogenesis of bacterial superinfection. Moreover, our study did not focus on the final diagnosis of super-or co-infection, because a certain diagnosis of bRTI is hard to make in the COVID-19 setting, as biomarkers are non-specific and respiratory tract colonization is difficult to distinguish from infection, especially in patients with previous underlying lung disease. Nevertheless, Stevens et al. found an association between the presence of positive respiratory samples and worse COVID-19 outcome, which highlights the importance of collecting microbiological samples [21] . Microbiological sampling was performed in 13.8% of the 203 COVID-19-positive participants, of which 4.9% had a significant positive result. This is in line with previous COVID-19 studies where significant respiratory samples ranged from 2% to 8.6% [7, 29, [31] [32] [33] [34] . MSSA and Enterobacterales were the most commonly isolated pathogens, in analogy with the ISARIC study [31] . This is probably because we considered rising serological kinetics as a diagnostic test and did not solely rely on single positive immunoglobulin G titres [29] . Only one (0.5%) case of bacteremia of respiratory origin was identified, which indirectly supports current evidence on the low incidence rate of bRTIs in patients with COVID-19 [31] . Antibiotics for a presumed bRTI were initiated in only 14% of all COVID-19 confirmed admissions. This seems very low compared to other comparable studies, reporting rates of antibiotic prescription above 50%. A metaanalysis by Langford et al. (2021) reported an antibiotic prescription rate of 71% [7] . A comparable retrospective study observed a prescription rate of 59% for respiratory antibiotics in ward patients [35] . The reasons for lower antibiotic prescription rate observed in our study are multiple: the prospective design of the study, the successful functioning of the AST with close follow-up of antibiotic prescriptions and an inclusion period that succeeded the first COVID-19 wave. Langford et al. also report a decreasing antibiotic prescription rate in studies enrolling participants during the first weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, compared to studies which ended patient enrolments by April 2020 (85.8% versus 62.6%) [7] . Similarly, the ISARIC study showed a decline in antibiotic prescriptions when comparing March-April 2020 to May 2020 [31] . A possible learning effect of the disease progression and the (mis)use of antibiotics in this setting could have meant physicians initiated an antibiotic in patients with (suspected) COVID-19 after the initial phase of the pandemic [7] . Additionally, we did not evaluate the patients during an ICU stay. It is known that patients in critical care are more prone to receive antibiotics [33] . Penicillins with a beta-lactamase inhibitor were prescribed most frequently (1.206 DDD/100 bed days). This is in line with previously reported results, which suggests a systematic preference for broad-spectrum antibiotics [7, 23, 33, 36] . Research suggests that the number of DDD may also be associated with a decreased antibiotic susceptibility [24] . In our study, the reported antibiotic consumption for COVID-19 confirmed admissions (0.87 DDD/admission and 8.92 DDD/100 hospital bed days) was lower than in a previously performed retrospective study by this research group (3.6 DDD/admission and 31.5 DDD/100 hospital bed days) [35] . Importantly, antibiotic consumption in ICU patients was taken into account in the retrospective study whereas this was not the case in the current prospective study. We were unable to compare our data with any other COVID-19 or historical influenza cohort, as other quantitative data regarding antibiotic DDDs in this context have not been published so far. Interestingly, the national average antibiotic consumption in Belgian acute care hospitals in 2018 was more than fourfold higher than the observed consumption in this study (respectively 3.28 DDD/admission and 46.2 DDD/100 hospital bed days versus 0.87 DDD/admission and 8.92 DDD/100 hospital bed days) [37] . However, this comparison is only indicative, as the national antibiotic consumption results do not distinguish types of infection. Moreover, in this study, the amount of DDD/admission only implied DDDs during admission on a COVID-19 ward. Because of those limitations, the case-bycase assessment by an ID specialist was a valuable tool to assess the antibiotic's appropriateness.",

In confirmed COVID-19 cases, almost half (45.8%) of antibiotic consumption was unnecessary. Therefore, AST interventions remain needed to reduce improper use of antibiotics, especially in patients with COVID-19, and to reduce the risk of antibiotic resistance development. Different studies implementing therapeutic guidelines combined with directed AST efforts on antibiotic use in the COVID-19 setting have proven efficacy with significant reduction of therapy duration and/or antibiotic quantity [38, 39] . Nevertheless, antibiotics can be indicated in selected cases, especially in severe disease or in immunocompromised patients. Certain guidelines also recommend a short course of antibiotics in case of radiological findings and inflammatory markers compatible with a bRTI, despite their low positive predictive value and the weak level of evidence [40, 41] . However, physicians can use a negative microbiological result of respiratory tract samples or blood cultures in their decision to interrupt antibiotic treatment, as well as the presence of low procalcitonin levels, which has a high negative predictive value for a bacterial pneumonia [16, 19, 42] .",

            "text": "In the driver analysis, five different variables were identified that significantly increased the odds of at least one antibiotic prescription for a (suspected) bRTI: a history of cerebrovascular disease, a high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio in male participants, increasing age, elevated ferritin level and the collection of at least one respiratory sample. Patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease are known to be at risk for aspiration pneumonia due to micro-aspiration, impaired airway clearance, insufficient tooth hygiene, relative immobilization and ineffective expectoration due to muscle weakness. In a study by He et al. patients with cardiovascular comorbidities had a higher probability of a bRTI [43] . However, evaluation of the medical history and physical examination in patients with a history of cerebrovascular disease often contribute poorly to the COVID-19 or bRTI diagnosis, which can also explain the lower threshold to start antibiotics [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . Elevated inflammatory biomarkers such as C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, neutrophil count and NLR are associated with worse prognosis in COVID-19-infected patients. As these inflammatory markers rise in the context of the COVID-19-related cytokine storm, they show a low predictive value for bRTI [16, 19, 26, 49] . However, a high neutrophil count is generally seen as an important biomarker for the diagnosis of a bacterial infection. Alongside lymphopenia, one of the markers for COVID-19, it is comprehensible that a high neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio was identified as a driver of antibiotic administration [50] [51] [52] . The fact that this was only significant in male participants could be explained by the higher inclusion rate of male patients. Additionally, male gender is a risk factor of acquiring severe COVID-19 and hospital-acquired infection in patients with COVID-19 [34] . Both older age and high ferritin level showed a slight enhanced risk of antibiotic prescription. The two parameters are known to be associated with a higher risk of severe SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could explain the association with antibiotic prescribing [53] [54] [55] .",

In this study, antibiotic prescribing rates in patients with COVID-19 were low. In particular, the total number of DDDs in patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis suggests thoughtful antibiotic use. However, AST efforts are now more important than ever to promote the judicious use of antibiotics in COVID-19-infected patients and to halt unnecessary and inappropriate antibiotic use.",

First, patients were not evaluated during ICU stay, while severe illness is a known risk factor for bacterial superinfection and thus physicians tend to prescribe more antibiotics in these patients with COVID-19 [34] . Second, as a result of the low rate of antibiotic prescriptions for (presumed) bRTI in this study, potential significant drivers of antibiotic prescription might not have been detected. Third, the study was only observational which implied that respiratory samples for bacteriological examination were not collected systematically, which could explain the low rates of respiratory sampling. However, the rate of documented respiratory cultures was similar in the ISARIC study (13% versus 14% in this study) [31] . In order to be able to compare the reported results, prospective antibiotic evaluation studies are needed in similar settings and in the ICU. Future studies should also focus on the value of bRTI diagnostic markers. Robust predictors and/or excluders of bacterial co-/superinfection are urgently needed and should be incorporated in evidence-based guidelines.",
