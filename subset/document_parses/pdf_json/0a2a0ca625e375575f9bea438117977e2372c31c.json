Unfortunately, there is no consensus on the optimal chest imaging approach in the evaluation of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, and radiology departments tend to use different approaches. Thus, the main objective of this survey was to assess how chest imaging modalities have been used during the different phases of the first COVID-19 wave in Italy, and which diagnostic technique and reporting system would have been preferred based on the experience gained during the pandemic.",

The link to participate in the survey was sent to all members of the Italian Society of Medical and Interventional Radiology (SIRM). Results The survey gathered responses from 716 SIRM members. The most notable result was that the most used and preferred chest imaging modality to assess/exclude/monitor COVID-19 pneumonia during the different phases of the first COVID-19 wave was computed tomography (51.8% to 77.1% of participants). Additionally, while the narrative report was the most used reporting system (55.6% of respondents), one-third of participants would have preferred to utilize structured reporting systems. Conclusion This survey shows that the participants' responses did not properly align with the imaging guidelines for managing COVID-19 that have been made by several scientific, including SIRM. Therefore, there is a need for continuing education to keep radiologists up to date and aware of the advantages and limitations of the chest imaging modalities and reporting systems.",

            "text": "One year after the emergence of the first Italian clusters of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, Italy is currently experiencing a third wave of the coronavirus pandemic. Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing remains the reference standard for the definitive diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection; however, it is well known that the sensitivity of RT-PCR is not optimal [1] [2] [3] . Therefore, in patients displaying clinical features suggestive of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a negative RT-PCR result cannot exclude the possibility of a SARS-CoV-2 infection. Thus, in this context, chest imaging modalities continue to play a crucial role in the evaluation of symptomatic patients with an intermediateto-high pre-test probability of SARS-CoV-2 infection or in resource-constrained environments where rapid decisionmaking is paramount to ensure proper treatment [4] . Specifically, for symptomatic patients exhibiting clinical features suggestive of COVID-19 pneumonia, the World Health Organization suggests the use of chest imaging modalities in cases where RT-PCR testing is negative, or in situations where care providers must decide between hospitalization and discharge of a patient [5] .",

In combination with CXR, however, LUS could be used during triage or in intensive care units to improve decision-making and to reduce the need for CT examinations, minimizing the risk of cross infection associated with the transport of COVID-19 patients.",

The survey link was generated so that each respondent was required to answer all questions in a single session. The survey questionnaire was prepared to collect baseline and specific information regarding the characteristics of the participants and their diagnostic approach to evaluating patients in different phases (phase 1, phase 2, and monitoring) of the first wave of the pandemic. Specifically, the first phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (beginning on February 21, 2020 and ending on May 3, 2020) corresponded to a period of high to moderate prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, whereas the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic (beginning on May 4, 2020) corresponded to a period of low prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 infection. The complete list of survey questions and their possible responses are presented in Table 1 .",

The preference for chest CT was significantly related to the geographical area in which the survey participants worked, with an increasing trend from Northern to Southern Italy and the Islands. The highest frequency of CT use was observed in Southern Italy and the Islands, which could probably be explained by the fact that there were fewer infected patients in these geographical areas than in other regions, especially relative to those in Northern Italy, which experienced the highest rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

While the frequency with which chest CT scan was used in the second phase was directly proportional to the number of patients hospitalized for COVID-19, the frequency of chest CT utilized for monitoring was inversely related to the number of hospitalized patients. This apparent contradiction may be explained by the fact that hospitals that had the highest number of admissions for COVID-19 in the first phase had (in a period of low disease prevalence) a greater need to quickly decide whether a patient should be discharged or hospitalized to reduce the pressure on the COVID-19 wards. Significant differences in the choice to using chest CT during the second phase were also observed in the sub-group analysis related to the workplace environment; particularly, university hospitals performed chest CT more frequently than other workplaces.",

The desire to change the diagnostic method from CXR to chest CT is likely due to the relatively higher sensitivity of chest CT in the detection of lung abnormalities (especially in the early stage of the disease) [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , as well as its superior ability to differentiate COVID-19 pneumonia from other infectious and noninfectious interstitial diseases [38] [39] [40] . However, CXR does have several advantages in the management of patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] . Although some radiologists and clinicians consider the information provided by CXR to be insufficient, a recent study demonstrated that the use of CXR instead of chest CT as a first-line imaging modality in a simulated COVID-19 pandemic triage was safe and helped optimize both the use of radiology resources and patient management [14] . Additionally, considering the rapid progression of lung abnormalities that occurs in cases of COVID-19 pneumonia, we believe that CXR, either alone or in combination with LUS, is the most appropriate diagnostic imaging tool for day-to-day monitoring of the course of the disease, particularly in critically ill patients.",

In particular, the SIRM has conceived and proposed a helpful structured reporting scheme for chest CT evaluations that can be utilized by all radiologists, regardless of their experience in chest imaging [37] . In the present study, we observed that more than half of the participants used an unstructured narrative report, and this reporting format was used significantly less frequently among respondents who worked in hospitals with more than 500 patients with COVID-19. This finding is likely due to the fact that larger hospitals became overwhelmed by a progressive increase in demand for radiological examinations, and this increased workload favored the introduction of other types of reporting, such as those involving a scoring system or structured reports. Additionally, most participants who used narrative reports indicated that they would have preferred to use other reporting systems, with about 40% preferring structured reports. The desire for structured reporting systems was expressed more frequently among participants working in the Southern Italy and Islands, probably due to the fact that in those geographical areas chest CT is the most commonly used and most preferred imaging modality to assess and monitor cases of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

As the participants' responses did not properly align with the recommendations that have been made by several scientific societies, including the SIRM, we believe there is a persistent need for continuing education to keep radiologists up to date and aware of the advantages and limitations of the chest imaging modalities and reporting systems used in the management of patients with pulmonary infections, including potentially severe forms such as COVID-19.",
