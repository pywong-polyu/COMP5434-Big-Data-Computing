In this review, we highlight the strategies used in clinical practice to support patients' needs as well as currently available pre-and post-disclosure support interventions. Recent Findings Clinical risk communication is complicated by the uncertainty associated with gene penetrance, inconclusive results, variable effectiveness of surgical and screening interventions, and inadequate awareness of clinical genetics. Interventions to support patients' psychosocial needs, and strategies for effective and scalable clinical risk communication are in routine use and largely effective at meeting patients' needs. Research is underway to develop newer supportive resources; however, the inadequate representation of all mutation carriers persists. Summary Effective clinical risk communication strategies, decision support aids, written educational materials, and supportive psychosocial tools can together have a large impact on meeting BRCA carriers' supportive needs.",

The discovery of BRCA1 in 1994 and BRCA2 in 1995 paved the pathway to routine clinical genetic testing for cancer susceptibility and their use has also steadily increased over time. Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 increase susceptibility to breast (55-72%) and ovarian (39-44%) cancers with a lower increase in risk indicated for cancers of the prostate, pancreas, and melanoma [1] [2] [3] . Similarly, mutations in BRCA2 increase susceptibility to female breast cancer (45-69%), ovarian cancer (11-17%), male breast cancer (< 6%), prostate cancer (15%), and to a lesser extent for pancreatic cancer, peritoneal cancer, Fanconi anemia, and myeloid leukemia [2, 3] . Around 3% of all breast cancers and 7% of all ovarian cancers have an underlying mutation in BRCA1/2 [4] . Distribution of mutation carriers as well as mutational spectrums for BRCA1/2 varies by race and ethnicity with the highest burden among those of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry [5, 6] .",

Per the technical definition of the term, variants of unknown significance (VUS) and benign variants are also mutations. Of note, American College of Medical Genomics prefers the term \"variant\" as lay audiences react negatively to the term \"mutation\" which has negative connotations and is associated with negatively valenced outcomes [9] . These pathogenic, likely pathogenic, VUS, likely benign, and benign variants have very different clinical implications; however, they all inform clinical management and are routinely communicated to patients. These results present different psychosocial challenges for patients which necessitates different strategies to help patients understand, psychologically adjust, and cope with their results. For example, family/social relationship difficulties are more common among women receiving pathogenic variants than VUS or benign variants [10] . Uncertainty is a prevalent issue among those with VUS results, although contradictory reports of decreased psychosocial problems among those with VUS also exist [11] . On the other hand, patients with benign results who have family history of pathogenic variants tend to suffer from survivor's guilt.",

Therefore, effective communication of quantitative risk information is a matter of necessity in clinical genetics as this knowledge is a necessary basis for effective decision-making. Once a pathogenic variant is identified in BRCA1/2, the objective of risk communication is to facilitate informed decision-making (e.g., whether and when to undergo prophylactic surgeries) and to change or modify health care behavior (e.g., intensive screening). These preference sensitive decisions are influenced by patients' (and even providers') a priori beliefs, knowledge, preferences, expectations, anxiety, and coping styles which in turn affect how patients and providers use the genetic risk information. Genetic and cancer risk information presented in a clinical encounter is frequently transformed in patients' minds resulting in discrepant objective and perceived risks. It is probably no surprise that many patients misunderstand their breast cancer and genetic risks. For example, patients tend to largely overestimate their breast cancer and genetic risks at the pre-genetic counseling stage, and although their risk perception becomes more accurate upon undergoing genetic counseling, where the accurate risk information is communicated to them, it still remains up to 24% higher than their objective cancer risk conferred by a BRCA1/2 mutation [13] .",

Men and transgender patients have yet another set of unique needs and there is limited data on safety of treatment options and hormone therapies for them. Generally, patients and providers are more aware of BRCA1/2 genes compared to less common breast cancer susceptibility genes (e.g., PALB2, PTEN, ATM); however, there is large variation in the awareness of the specific variant classifications within these genes, their associated clinical significance, and management that is necessary for proper counseling and follow-up. In fact, many patients, especially those seen outside the genetics research community or academic health care centers, report being ignored or \"brushed off\" or even having to counsel providers about their specific mutations [14] .

Unaffected individuals without a personal history of cancer must grapple with the uncertainty of developing cancer. These gene penetrance estimates appear to vary from 40 to 66% for breast cancer and between 18 and 46% for ovarian cancer for BRCA1/2 [3] . Mutation carriers without personal history of breast cancer need to decide between undergoing prophylactic mastectomy versus increased surveillance via breast MRI in addition to mammogram which involves balancing considerations of insurance coverage, cost, and quality-adjusted life years. Although surveillance methods substantially increase the probably of early cancer detection, false-positive tests are associated with increased distress rates. This \"watchful waiting\" surveillance approach is adopted by 20-50% of BRCA mutation carriers [15] ; however, studies indicate that fewer than 70% of women are adherent to guideline-based screening recommendations. The effectiveness of preventive interventions is also associated with a great deal of uncertainty. Prophylactic bilateral mastectomy is associated with 90-100% relative reduction in breast cancer incidence, yet there remains a miniscule residual level of risk of breast cancer from leftover breast tissue [16] . Prophylactic bilateral oophorectomy and salpingo oophorectomy are associated with significant reduction in ovarian cancer risk of up to 80% in efficacy studies [17, 18] , a 50% reduction in breast cancer risk when the surgery is performed before menopause [17, 19, 20] , and a 68% reduction in all-cause mortality [21] . Those who opt for surgery over screening, the repercussions of unanticipated biopsy with its attendant anxiety are not negligible. In addition, potential unanticipated repercussion of change in body image/lack of satisfaction with body image/change in intimacy should be considered. Additional factors known to influence the decision of surveillance versus surgery include family history of cancer, perceived genetic risk, and fear of cancer [22, 23] . Given these complex issues and multifaceted effect of decisions, it is critical that specialists provide emotional support in addition to medical information.",

Although mutation carriers can achieve greater risk reduction by undergoing both mastectomy and salpingooophorectomy than either alone, these life-altering decisions and their timing are often shaped by desire to have children. Although use of hormone replacement therapy does not negate the benefits of salpingo-oophorectomy in BRCA carriers, the decision to take hormone replacement therapy post-preventive oophorectomies needs to be weighed against its effects on bone health and quality of life. Other long-term decisions can impact individuals beyond the index patient such as whether or not to disclose genetic test results to family members that can inform cascade testing, how/when to relay results are also important decisions that individuals can be supported in. Although essential for cascade genetic testing, family communication of BRCA mutation status is a difficult process and proband's must balance knowledge of families' psychosocial function and cultural context in deciding whether, how, and when to share in order to best benefit their family.",

When observed, negative psychosocial effects are mild, transient, and return to baseline within a few months after testing [27, 28] . However, there are subgroups of tested individuals at greater than average risk of psychological distress following testing. Women, younger people [29] , non-Whites, and individuals with less satisfactory social support and lower educational levels had higher levels of general and cancer-specific distress, regardless of mutation status in the 12 months following testing. Other studies have reported that individuals with a prior history of major or minor depression or those with more affected first-degree relatives or those reporting more intense grief reactions had greater distress 1 to 6 months after disclosure. Psychosocial difficulties experienced by carriers of BRCA mutation can be varied and can arise from several sources -generic distress (i.e., anxiety and depression), concern about hereditary predisposition to cancer, familial and social issues, emotions, familial cancer risk, and personal cancer risk, self-worth, and cancer related stigma. Although post-test breast cancer worry and anxiety generally increase for women with positive results and decrease for women who test negative [30] , these worry and anxiety tend to be short-lived [30] but a minority continue to have longterm elevated distress [26] . BRCA carriers report clinically significant state and health anxiety resulting from feelings of vulnerability, stigma, and health anxiety. Dysfunctional coping strategies, which refers to behavioral disengagement, denial, self-distraction, and self-blame, are often related to quality of life in BRCA carriers [31] and may be targeted through psychological therapy to improve quality of life. Unsurprisingly, type of BRCA1/2 result differently affects distress [32] with higher distress reported by those carrying pathogenic variants.",

Although generally performed via in-person encounters with a genetic counselor, newer formats of pretest genetic counseling are increasingly being used and data suggests that they may be equally effective. Telegenetics, especially in the context of pre-test genetic counseling, is highly satisfactory to patients [36] due to its convenience [37] and cost and time savings. Participation in telegenetics during the COVID-19 pandemic has proliferated to both pretest and post-test counseling to the extent that the majority of all counseling appointments are now completed virtually. Although telephone post-test genetic counseling was found to be non-inferior to in-person in randomized controlled trials [38, 39] , patients in the telephone group had poorer long term engagement with surveillance and prophylactic surgery [38, 40] . Preliminary data on use of innovative chatbotbased genetic service delivery seems promising [41] and randomized trials to test their efficacy against standard of care genetic service delivery models as well as long-term outcomes are currently underway [42\u2022] . Regardless of the mode of service delivery, it is important to tailor risk communication in genetic counseling appointments based on individuals' a priori knowledge and awareness of genetic testing, cancer worry, tolerance for uncertainty, and psychosocial needs [43] .",

Healthcare providers including genetic counselors and oncologists remain the most trustworthy information sources for patients. However as noted previously, patients demonstrate some resistance to risk information given which highlights the importance of using effective risk communication strategies. A wealth of research from the field of risk communication suggests short-term age-related risk estimates may be of more value to patients than cumulative lifetime risks. Although patients prefer percentages, they often transform numerical estimates into discrete categories (high or low risk). As a result, the use of verbal description of the risk magnitude (e.g., \"a higher risk than another woman in the general population\") leads to better understanding. Patients' inflated post-counseling risk perception and overestimation of risk is correlated with pre-counseling worry [13] so tailoring risk communication strategies based on precounseling self-reported worry is another strategy that could help patients comprehend their risks accurately, but it is not a part of routine clinical practice. European breast surgeons and general practitioners prefer to use absolute risks numerically and frame them negatively [44] . This negative framing is derived from a body of research which shows that lossframed messaging is demonstrably more effective at behavior change than gain-framed messaging [45] . This applies to messages that aim to improve early detection including mammography and breast self-exam -e.g., loss-framed, \"If you don't have regular mammograms, you reduce your chances of detecting breast cancer at an early, more treatable stage,\" vs the gain-framed appeal of, \"If you have regular mammograms, you increase your chances of detecting breast cancer at an early, more treatable stage.\" However, the effectiveness of these loss-or gain-framed messaging strategies has not been studied in high-risk BRCA-positive populations.",

Some interventions work by providing peer support groups for mutation carriers by putting them in touch with other mutation carriers. These can be moderated telephone-based interventions where a mutation carrier serves as a support provider or online support groups (e.g., FORCE and Facebook) that are not moderated. Engagement in these communities has been shown to have variable but generally positive psychosocial outcomes (lower breast cancer distress and depression) and to help with post-test decision-making including risk-reducing surgery [50] . BRCA carriers engaged in these communities report high satisfaction [51] , appreciation of psychological support, interest for future psychoeducational groups, and a higher likelihood of following through with risk-reducing surgery [50] but attendance in these groups did not change preference for management or surveillance [49] .

Efforts to develop chatbots to address patients' informational needs around BRCA germline mutations are currently underway [52] .

In genetic counseling, these include summary letters explaining genetic test results and their clinical implications, family letters intended for sharing with relatives to aid in family communication of genetic test results and cascade genetic testing, and the laboratory-generated genetic result report. Content and format of genetic result letters vary widely between genetic counseling practice settings and their impact on patient-centered outcomes is not understood. Upon formal content and format analyses, these letters were frequently found to be overly complex exceeding recommended readability measures [54] which highlight the complexity of genomic information that needs to be communicated in a clinical setting. Family letters and encouragement for disclosing results to at-risk relatives are a routine part of many genetic counseling practices [55] but the degree to which they help with family communication of BRCA mutations remains to be studied. Although rarely read by patients, laboratory generated reports of genetic test results present information in even more complex formats often containing variant specific information [56] that are likely incomprehensible to most lay readers. Most of these supportive materials are written well above CDC-suggested reading level for health communication and warrants reconsideration in design.",

In addition, we must tailor the clinical message to patients' ability and willingness to cope with the information to facilitate informed decision-making around these preference sensitive topics. As clinical genetic services reach populations beyond those served by tertiary cancer centers of excellence, scalable post-test support interventions are essential to serve the psychosocial, emotional, and clinical decision support needs of individuals carrying BRCA1/2 mutations. Lastly, many of the most substantial gaps in the BRCA literature have to do with the lack of representation of all individuals who carry BRCA mutations. The vast majority of research on BRCA1/2 mutation carriers only include females who are overwhelmingly non-Hispanic White, while men, racial/ ethnic minorities, and transgender individuals are often excluded from this body of work. Understanding the needs, perspectives, and preferences of these underrepresented populations will be a critical step to ensuring that effective strategies are developed to help all BRCA1/2 mutation carriers comprehend and cope with their diagnosis.",
