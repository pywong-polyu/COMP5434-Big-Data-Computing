We quantified impact of Wuhan lock-down on COVID-19 spread during chunyun across the nation. Methods: During the period of January 1 to February 9, 2020, a total of 40,278 confirmed COVID-19 cases from 319 municipalities in mainland China were considered in this study. The cross-coupled meta-population methods were employed using between-city Baidu migration index. We modelled four scenarios of geographic spread of COVID-19 including the presence of both chunyun and lock-down (baseline); lock-down without chunyun (scenario 1); chunyun without lock-down (scenario 2); and the absence of both chunyun and lock-down (scenario 3).",

The geographic distribution of cases revealed that chunyun facilitated the COVID-19 spread in the majority but not all cities, and the effectiveness of Wuhan lock-down was offset by chunyun. Impacts of Wuhan lock-down during chunyun on the COVID-19 spread demonstrated heterogenetic geographic patterns. Conclusion: Our results strongly supported the travel restriction as one of the effective responses and highlighted the importance of developing area-specific rather than universal countermeasures.",

Across China, the population mobility had been increasing since the start of chunyun and reached the greatest on January 21 and then decreased afterward (Fig. 2) . While the patterns of population inflow and outflow in China were similar, these patterns for population inflow to and outflow from Wuhan presented in different ways. The population outflow from Wuhan showed a generally increasing trend up to January 22 whereas the population inflow to Wuhan remained almost constant. It is noteworthy for Wuhan that the population outflow was always greater than the population inflow until January 26 (shortly after the announcement of lockdown). Change of population outflow from Wuhan was also noteworthy for the sharp increase after announcement of human-to-human transmission of COVID-19 on January 20. Figures 3a and b illustrates a reasonably good model fit and the time-varying estimates of basic reproductive number (R0 t ) of COVID-19 during the study period. Although we assumed R0 t varies over time, it stayed at the same level from January 1 to 25 and fell from 3.47 to 3.24 from January 26 onwards. Note that it slightly increased to 3.27 on February 9. The modelled latent and infectious time of COVID-19 was 6.11 days (95%CI: 3.13, 10.63) and 3.26 days (95%CI: 1.06,5.16), respectively. 20 .22% more cases than the baseline in the absence of chunyun and lock-down. Figure 4 demonstrates the geographic distribution of change in cumulative COVID-19 cases comparing different scenarios with the baseline scenario (the presence of both chunyun and lock-down) by February 9, 2020. Under scenario 1 (Fig. 4a) , the majority of cities showed a relatively sharp change in case reduction despite the nuance expression in a few populous cities, indicating that chunyun was not a common stimulus for the COVID-19 spread across the nation. Under scenario 2 (Fig. 4b) , all the cities would have had greater number of cases in the absence of lock-down, in particular, those in northeast, south and west China would have an increase over 100%, indicating the protective effect of Wuhan lock-down on preventing additional disease penetration (Fig. 4c) , the protective effect of Wuhan lock-down varied in space and was offset by the presence of chunyun, especially for those corridor cities near Wuhan. Note that areas with over 100% increase of cases (in dark red color) under this scenario were mainly located within the five city groups shown in Fig. 4d .",

            "text": "In this retrospective analysis of 40,278 confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, we modelled 3 exposure scenarios using publically available data reported on a daily basis by local public health authorities. These scenarios differed in the exposure to chunyun, the largest population mobility on the earth, and Wuhan lock-down, the unprecedented control of 11 million people's movement in response to the rapid spread of COVID-19 from the city. Of the simulations of three exposure scenarios, the lock-down of Wuhan remarkably demonstrated the protective effects by preventing 32.46% COVID-19 incidents by February 9, 2020, whereas chunyun contributed towards the observed geographic spread and would have produced 3.84% more cases by the Fig. 3 a, Model fitting with the cumulative cases of COVID-19 in China; b, instantaneous basic reproductive number (R0 t ) of COVID-19 during Jan 1 to Feb 9, 2020 same period. Although the impact of the presence of both chunyun and lock-down of Wuhan on the COVID-19 spread was heterogeneous in space, the majority of cities had been protected with risk of a subsequent outbreak mitigated by the lock-down in spite of the chunyun offset. In addition to previous findings allowing for the effects of fleeing population [11] , flight restriction [12] , and limited medical resources [10] , we further demonstrated the individual role for chunyun and its combined role with the lock-down of Wuhan in comparison with the absence of both events. These findings complemented the growing evidence of impact of population mobility on the geographic spread of COVID-19, justified the invocation of Wuhan lock-down instead of simply claiming the precautionary principle, and provided additional vigilance against inter-city human movement at the critical early phase for next-stage informed decision making with respect to COVID-19 prevention and control in the communities.",

            "text": "In this study, we also investigated the epidemiological characteristics of COVID-19 outbreak in China. We first estimated its instantaneous R0 t , and found a decrease from 3.47 to 3.24 on January 26, which was probably due to the observed decrease in population mobility (Fig. 2) . In addition, our estimate of latent and infectious periods were 6.11 and 3.26 days, respectively, with the former being comparable with the existing clinical studies [17, 18] Percentage change (%) was based on the baseline and highlighted in bold and the latter, being rarely reported. Compared with the previously reported basic reproductive number (R0) which were fixed and ranged from 2.24 to 3.80 [3, [18] [19] [20] , our estimate was derived from a time varying model, which was somewhat more reliable as we have taken into account a larger sample size as well as population mobility between cities that would potentially affect both the contact rates between individuals and subsequently the estimation of COVID-19 spread. Notwithstanding the decrease of R0 t , there was an increasing trend on February 9 which corresponded to the time when migrants returned to study or work. Considering the contribution of chunyun towards geographic spread of COVID-19, this rebound trend of R0 t implied that the epidemic would perhaps spread more rapidly and move into the next stage of becoming endemic. Therefore, continuing efforts with rigorous prevention and control measures are required and expected to be strictly implemented in the communities including social distancing and home quarantine. We estimated the COVID-19 occurrence under three scenarios and their respective changes in relation to the baseline incidents for each city. We found that there was evidently spatial heterogeneity in effects of chunyun and/ or Wuhan lock-down. In principle, chunyun contributed towards the COVID-19 spread in China (Table 1) but not specifically for each locality (Fig. 4a) , while the Wuhan lock-down restricted the subsequent spread towards the other cities across the nation (Table 1, Fig. 4b ). In the absence of both chunyun and lock-down (Fig. 4c) , more evident reduction in COVID-19 incidents would have occurred for five major urban agglomerations. These urban agglomerations (Fig. 4d) consist of two kinds of city clusters, i.e., well-developed megacities, and the others nested in the undeveloped regions of China. There is an obvious speculation that these clusters would experience similar outgoing and ingoing travel demands all year round, and therefore the effects of chunyun would be nuance. It is noteworthy that corridor cities near Wuhan (Fig. 4c) did not benefit much from the Wuhan lock-down as its protective effect was offset by chunyun. These corridor cities would perhaps become a case reservoir prior to the lock-down of Wuhan. Therefore, these corridor cities should be given a priority for continuing efforts in allocation of healthcare resources. Additional strategies should be developed based on their area-level characteristics.",

            "text": "Evidence of comparative effectiveness of large-scale lock-down on 11-million populations is rare because the outbreak of contagious disease of this kind is highly unusual and so is to have reliable national data. Using a larger sample size than previous studies and clear evidence of exposure, our findings are somewhat robust. However, there are some limitations. First, the use of deterministic SEIR model would be acceptable given the successful control of COVID-19 in China [21] . Yet, our analysis did not consider the under-reporting of cases during the study period, due in part to the presymptomatic transmission and asymptomatic individuals are neglected [22] , which may result in an underestimation bias of our results. Iterated filtering algorithm such as Maximum Likelihood Estimation or Bayesian approach could be another option [23] , especially in other settings with much more uncertainties than that of China. Second, the mathematical model is a deterministic model which cannot capture stochastic effects during the spread of COVID-19 under the influence of multiple socio-environmental factors. This may bias the number of incident cases of a modelled scenario. Third, we considered municipal cities as the spatial components, however, these publically available data were sparse at the city level for modelling a city-specific reproduction number, and therefore we assumed it the same across all cities. Although that the reproduction number for the entire country we calculated in this study is not substantially different from the others using a general SEIR model, it is possible that the transmissibility of COVID-19 might change from place to place. The basic reproduction number in the current setting could be underestimated, especially when the restricted travels of all SEIR individuals would underestimate the number of active cases in each region [24] . Considering that fewer people travel making each region behaving as epidemiologically isolated region in the presence of lockdown, future studies would focus on the identification of hotspot cities at risks of becoming endemic allowing for geographical variation in reproduction number estimation. Fourth, the three simulated scenarios were based on different restrictive measures of population mobility, lacking control of other confounding factors, and therefore results should be interpreted with caution.",
