For this reason, there is an emphasis on evaluating diagnostic tools for screening. Chest CT scans are emerging as a useful tool in the diagnostic process of viral pneumonia cases associated with COVID-19. This review examines the sensitivity, specificity, and feasibility of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 compared with real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Methods Sensitivity and specificity of chest CT in detecting COVID-19 in its various phases was compared using RT-PCR as a gold standard. A \"reverse calculation approach\" was applied and treated chest CT as a hypothetical gold standard and compared RT-PCR to it point out the flaw of the standard approach. Results High sensitivity (67-100%) and relatively low specificity (25-80%) was reported for the CT scans. However, the sensitivity of RT-PCR was reported to be modest (53-88%), hence cannot serve as an appropriate ground truth. The \"reverse calculation approach\" showed that CT could have a higher specificity (83-100%) if we consider the modest sensitivity of the RT-PCR.",
