            "text": "Enduring low energy availability (LEA) is associated with several potentially serious physiological and mental conditions. LEA has been found highly prevalent among female elite athletes within endurance sports, thus hampering athletes' health and performance. The prevalence and the underpinning risk factors of LEA among female elite football players are less studied. One reason is that the existing self-report measures and technological devices to monitor energy intake and expenditure are inadequately adapted to capture the nature of the physical activity and energy expenditure among football players and are thus inaccurate. The present paper outlines a study protocol addressing the prevalence of LEA, the measurement of LEA and the correlations of LEA in terms of health and performance in female football players. Four studies will be conducted with the following aims (1) to evaluate the accuracy of global positioning systems (GPS)-based devices to monitor energy expenditure with indirect calorimetry as the gold standard, (2) to assess energy intake, quantify energy expenditure and investigate energy availability through self-report instruments, double labelled water (DLW) and GPS monitoring devices, (3) to determine the point prevalence of LEA using self-report instruments, DLW, dual-X-ray-absorptiometry (DXA) to quantify muscle and bone mass distribution and density, and a battery of hormonal analyses, and (4) to explore whether the prevalence of LEA varies across a full football season. Measures covering mental symptoms and psychological resources will be included, and a selection of biological measures derived from study 3. Measurements of DXA and DLW are resource-demanding and will be collected from one professional club (N~20 women). In contrast, the remaining data will be collected from four professional clubs (N~60 women) located in Bergen, the largest city within the Western region of Norway. Overall procedures and biobank storage procedures have been approved for data collection that will end in December 2024.",

High costs connected with logistic demands make such procedures unfeasible during matches, especially in larger study populations. Questionnaire-based methods are feasible alternatives, that is, procedures like food diaries, remote food photographic methods and 24 hours recalls in quantifying EI-but at the expense of more measurement errors. Yet, high reliability of self-reporting procedures against DLW has been found only for male football players. 9 Another approach in measuring EEE is the use of microtechnological positioning devices. Activity monitors that combine accelerometry and measurement of heat production and skin conductivity show promising findings among ball game athletes with indirect calorimetry as the gold standard. 10 Still, the commercial sale of such devices has been terminated. Other devices used in the literature include heart rate, power metres and global positioning systems (GPS). Recent quality improvements 11 of GPS-based devices make them a feasible alternative to monitor player load. 12 However, in exploring the prevalence of LEA and RED-S, GPS and other microtechnological devices may fall short considering the intermittent nature of physical expenditure in football, which the GPS algorithms cover more poorly. 13 The theoretical concept of metabolic power has been proposed 14 to better account for the energetic cost of accelerations and decelerations. Still, metabolic powerbased methods seem to underestimate the energetic cost of football-specific actions compared with the reference standard of indirect calorimetry. 13 Indeed, there is a need to investigate the accuracy of different devices in measuring EEE during intermittent activity to assess the EA among football players more accurately.",

[16] [17] [18] Moreover, this casts some uncertainty about the link between LEA and disordered eating as it is not depression but rather, anxiety disorders that stand out as a likely understanding of the spectrum of eating disorders [19] [20] [21] and the nature of excessive physical activity. 22 Furthermore, undereating and insufficient EI may arise from non-pathological reasons like poor awareness of appropriate sport-specific fuelling, lack of interest or time to prepare meals meeting refuelling requirements. 1 23-25 Athletes are in general also characterised by positive attributes like resilience and well-being that may facilitate self-care and protect against an inner or external drive to undereat.

Additional data collection will primarily take place at outpatient healthcare facilities and certified physiological laboratories Table 1 provides an overview of the microtechnological devices used in studies 1, 2 and 3, respectively. In study 1, these measures will be post-hoc compared against indirect calorimetry. 33 Oxygen uptake (VO 2 ) will be measured continually throughout the test, using a portable gas analyzer (VO 2 Master Health Sensors). Due to oxygen deficit at exercise onset, the post-exercise oxygen consumption will be added to the overall oxygen cost of the physical exercise protocol, following rest periods within the protocol. 34 The results of study 1 will serve as a reference for measuring EEE during the data collection of the remaining studies, necessary to calculate EA. The data collection for studies 2 and 3 will be completed simultaneously for approximately 6 months. In study 2, total energy expenditure will be measured via DLW to quantify the total energy expenditure of this population, following the Maastricht protocol. 35 In studies 3 and 4, players will, during training and matches, wear a GPS device (based on study 1) for analysis of duration of the activity, total distance covered, average speed, time in different speed zones. For study 3, GPS measures using metabolic power will also aid to quantify EA through EEE, in addition to general EE provided by DLW, as the latter cannot specify the EE of single training sessions or matches. Measurement of EE through GPS devices will also be used during study 4 to quantify EA. A 24-hour diet recalls distributed randomly throughout the data collection will quantify EI for studies 2,3 and 4, respectively.",

Despite numerous studies on the use of DLW, we only located a single study examining the relationship between DLW-based RMR (representing chronic energy unbalance) and the LEAF-Q questionnaire, which indicates a Pearson r of approx. 0.45. As football is physiologically more intensive, we consider a stronger association, likely between 0.45 and 0.60. Using an alpha=0.05, r=0.50, and a lower 95% CI of r>0.30, requires ~50 independent observations. Assuming an intraclass correlation of 0.25 requires 5 repeated measures from 20 women to achieve an effective sample size of N=50, given a statistical power of 0.80. For study 3 (prevalence), assuming a prevalence of ~0.35 (reported between 0.15 and 0.55 in the literature), power of 0.80, alpha of 0.05 and a finite population (max 200 elite players in Norway), requires a minimum of approx. 60 or 120 observations for a precision of \u00b10.10 and \u00b10.05, respectively. We, therefore, recruit a minimum of 60 women from 3 elite clubs. Adding 4 repeated measures throughout the full football season (assuming ICC=0.25) yields an effective sample size of approximately 137 independent observations that we regard as adequately sensitive to study point precision and variation in prevalence.",

The statistical power may thus be a critical issue in this study. The COVID-19 pandemic restrictions and the nature of the finite population provide few options to enlarge the project to other national regions, which could entail an increased risk concerning lowering feasibility related to non-participation drop-out or missing data. In this project, feasibility was weighted highly due to the allegiance, commitment and adherence to the overall aims and the procedures for data collection among the female players, the club leaders and the overall supporting teams. Moreover, to ensure compliance, a research team member will be present to respond to queries and secure optimal data quality during the data collection procedures. In the present COVID-19 situation with heavy travel restrictions, a similar allegiance and commitment might not have been possible with a national, multisite implementation approach. Given that we consider the effect size estimations as fair and the compensation that repeated measures offer in terms of statistical power and offering future interesting study possibilities, the current project may yield new and high-quality knowledge to this emerging research field.",

It takes a considerable amount of time and access to a large group of project-independent players to develop and validate a football-specific new instrument to capture the proxies of LEA. However, the present user engagement procedure is, in our opinion, satisfactory and will provide a basis for future validation studies.",
