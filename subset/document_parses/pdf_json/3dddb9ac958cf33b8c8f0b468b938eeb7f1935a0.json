Using the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS), we investigated the association between PD levels and risk of all-cause and chronic disease-specific mortality and compared the contribution of chronic disease-related mortality to that of suicide. Methods Data from 195, 531 adults, who participated in the NHIS between 1997 and 2004, were linked to the National Death Index records through to 2006. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) across four levels of PD, measured using the Kessler-6 scale. Outcomes included allcause mortality, and mortality due to all CVDs and subtypes, all cancers and subtypes, diabetes mellitus, alcoholic liver disease and suicide. Results During a mean follow-up time of 5.9 years, 7665 deaths occurred. We found a dose-response association between levels of PD and all-cause mortality, with the adjusted HRs (95% CI) elevated for all levels of PD, when compared to asymptomatic levels: subclinical 1.10 (1.03-1.16), symptomatic 1.36 (1.26-1.46) and highly symptomatic 1.57 (1.37-1.81). A similar association was found for all CVDs and certain CVD subtypes, but not for cancers, cerebrovascular diseases diabetes mellitus. Excess mortality attributable to suicide and alcoholic liver disease was evident among those with levels of PD only. Conclusion PD symptoms, of all levels, were associated with an increased risk of all-cause and CVD-specific mortality while higher PD only was associated with suicide. These findings emphasise the need for lifestyle interventions targeted towards improving physical health disparities among those with PD.",

            "text": "Mental disorders are highly prevalent and a leading contributor to global disability [1] . Whilst debilitating in their own right, mental disorders often co-occur with physical health comorbidities with up to 80% of those living with a serious mental disorder (SMD) reporting a physical health condition [2] . Comorbid conditions (e.g. cardiovascular diseases) reduce quality of life [3] , impede employment and recovery [4] and increase the risk of premature mortality [2, 5] . In particular, individuals with Severe Mental Disorders (SMDs) have an average reduced life expectancy of 20 years [6] . This may in part be explained by the excess risk of suicide-related mortality, which is well recognized among those with mental disorders [7, 8] . However, emerging evidence suggests this mortality gap is also largely explained by poor physical health [2] . Indeed, recent Australian data show that more than three quarters of this excess mortality are attributable to the impact of chronic physical health conditions, such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer, rather than suicide [9] . This can be explained by the illness itself, but also by the noxious effects of medications and poor lifestyle behaviors associated with SMDs, including higher smoking rates, physical inactivity and increased alcohol consumption [10] .",

These symptoms can range in severity, but are often subthreshold and do not meet criteria for a clinical diagnosis [15] . In common with other mental health conditions, PD is associated with unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as poor diet, smoking, physical inactivity, and alcohol intake, that may predispose individuals to chronic diseases [16] . For instance, clinically significant levels of PD are associated with an increased risk of incident CVD [17] , chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes [18] . Moreover, prospective studies have observed associations between PD and an increased risk of mortality due to chronic diseases such as CVD [19, 20] , cancer [21] and liver disease [22] . More recently, a prospective study, which examined data (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) ) from the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) (N = 330,367), observed an association between PD and all-cause, CVD and cancer-specific mortality [20] . However, the specific causes of mortality, such as subtypes of CVD (e.g. heart failure, cerebrovascular disease), were not examined. Moreover, although high levels of PD are an established risk factor for death by suicide [23] , few studies have considered the risk PD confers to mortality that is specific to both chronic diseases and suicide, especially across the spectrum of PD symptom severity.",

The NHIS is an ongoing US cross-sectional survey that has been conducted annually by the National Centre for Health Statistics in collaboration with the US Census Bureau. The NHIS uses a stratified, multistage sample design to select participants to capture a nationally representative sample of the US civilian non-institutionalized population. Information is collected through face-to-face household interview surveys with all household members (for basic health information only) and one randomly sampled adult and child (for additional health information). More details on the study methodology can be found elsewhere [24] . The publicuse survey data from the NHIS are available from 1956 to 2019. Since 1997, the NHIS included the information of psychological distress measured by the Kessler-6 scale. The public-use mortality data for detailed death causes (such as suicide, ischaemic heart disease, heart failure, etc.) were available up to 2006. Therefore, for the current study, data from eight waves of the NHIS conducted from 1997 to 2004, including mortality data up to 2006, were used. Data from 237,847 participants who were aged 18-84 years were used and linked to mortality data for all-causes, specific chronic diseases and suicide [25, 26] . We excluded 3307 participants with missing data on PD, and 39,009 participants with history of diabetes, liver disease, coronary heart disease, stroke or cancer at baseline, to exclude the possibility that the presence of disease at baseline was driving any excess mortality outcomes observed at follow-up. This left 195, 531 participants available for analyses. The NHIS has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants.",

The K6 comprised six questions that asked respondents how often they felt sad, nervous, restless or fidgety, hopeless, that everything was worth an effort, and/or worthless during the past 30 days. Responses were scored on a 5-point Likert scale that ranged in frequency from \"all of the time\" (score of 4) to \"none of the time\" (score of 0), with total scores ranging between 0 and 24. A cut-off point of \u2265 6 has previously been identified for \"moderate\" psychological distress based on treatment seeking patterns in a population sample [28] . Based on these cut-off points, four categories of psychological distress were identified for this study: asymptomatic, score = 0; subclinical, scores = 1-5; symptomatic, scores = 6-12; and highly symptomatic, scores = 13-24 [29, 30] . For the secondary analysis, a cut-off score of 13 was used to identify individuals with and without serious psychological distress (SPD) [27] (i.e. scores equivalent to those within the highly symptomatic distress category). This method is in line with previous studies and was used to enable comparability with the wider literature [31] . For example, on the basis of ROC curve analysis, a score of \u2265 13 on K6 has previously been selected as the optimal cutpoint to identify psychological distress associated with serious mental illness [32] . This cutpoint is associated with a sensitivity of 0.36, a specificity of 0.92, and a total classification accuracy of 0.92 and equalizes the number of false positives and false negatives in population samples [27] .",

Causes of death were classified using the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Injuries, and Causes of Death (ICD-10), and grouped into the following categories: cancers, diabetes mellitus, CVDs, digestive diseases and self-harm and interpersonal violence. For the purpose of this study, the primary outcome was all-cause mortality, and secondary outcomes were mortality arising due to specific causes of mortality, including chronic diseases (i.e. CVD, diabetes, cancer and alcoholic liver disease), chronic disease subtypes and suicide. Deaths from all CVDs were coded using codes I11, I13, I10, I12, I70, I71-I78 and I80-I99, including ischaemic heart disease (I20-I25), heart failure (I50), and cerebrovascular disease (I60-I69). All cancer-specific deaths were identified using codes C00-C97, which included cancer of the trachea, bronchus, and lung mortality (C33-C34), cancer of the colon, rectum and anus (C18-C21), cancer of the breast (C50) and cancer of the prostate (C61). Mortality due to diabetes mellitus was identified by code E10-E14 and alcoholic liver disease by code K70. Finally, suicide-specific mortality was identified using codes X72-X74, X60-X71, X75-X84 and Y87.0.",

Cox proportional hazards models were used to calculate the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations between PD and mortality, with participants scoring \"0\" (i.e. asymptomatic) as the referent group. HRs were unadjusted and maximally adjusted (age, sex, race, education, income, BMI, alcohol drinking, physical activity, smoking status and survey year). To take into account potential reverse causation, sensitivity analyses were also conducted by excluding the first two years of follow-up. In the secondary analyses, we evaluated the association of PD with mortality, comparing SPD (scores 13-24) versus no SPD (scores 0-12) in the maximally adjusted model. Subgroup analysis based on age, sex, smoking status and physical activity were conducted among those with and without SPD for the primary outcome (all-cause mortality); a small number of cases prohibited subgroup analyses for all other outcomes. The NHIS uses a multistage sampling design; strata, cluster and weights were accounted for in the analyses for generalization of the estimates. All analyses were conducted with Stata version ",

Similarly, a meta-analysis of 10 large prospective cohort studies (N = 68,222) from the Health Survey for England reported that PD was associated with an increased risk of mortality from all-causes, CVD, and external causes (e.g. injuries and poisonings) across all levels of distress. Our findings add to these studies by providing a more detailed analysis of specific-cause-related mortality among those with PD.",

This might relate to differences in measures of psychological distress used, length of follow-up or the overall proportion of cancer deaths within study populations. For example, the proportion of cancer deaths within our sample was lower than that of Russ et al. (1.0% vs 3.7% of deaths in the total sample, respectively).

Based on K10 validation studies against the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders and International Classification of Disease defined psychiatry disorders using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview, the correspondence between the K10-and by extension-K6 scores and the probability of being identified as a current diagnostic case would suggest that PD in this study can be interpreted a more persistent distress [35] . Accumulating evidence indicates that persistent stress has a negative impact on cardiovascular, nervous and immune systems, and may increase susceptibility to numerous diseases [36] . PD can elicit changes to sympathetic and parasympathetic pathways [37] , and dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which in turn may result in increased inflammation and cortisol release [38] . This may impact the cardiovascular system by precipitating myocardial infarction or dysrhythmia [37] or by accelerating the atherosclerotic process [37] . These changes are likely to occur over time with persistent levels of distress. Due to limitations in the data, we were unable to adjust for comorbid mental disorders, but it is plausible that at least some of the variation in the model is explained by mental health comorbidities or associated treatment regimens. For example, PD is highly comorbid with other psychiatric conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Treatment regimens for these conditions (especially when treatment is refractory) have well-established cardiometabolic consequences or side effects [39] . These can be offset with lifestyle interventions at the time of initiation of therapy [40] . Among those not meeting physical activity recommendations, a significant association was observed between SPD and increased mortality risk. This association was not evident among those who met physical activity recommendations; however, the difference in estimates between the two groups was of a small magnitude. Nonetheless, even small effects may be of importance at the population level, given 100% population exposure.",

A study of adults from Scotland (N = 6576) previously found that the association between PD and CVD risk is largely explained by behavioral processes as increased smoking, physical inactivity and poor diet, which may be part of the coping response to PD and could potentiate disease pathogenesis [16] . However, these behaviors do not fully explain the poorer health outcomes among those with elevated PD with drivers of these disparities including healthcare utilization, social barriers and the healthcare system. For instance, those with mental disorders often have suboptimal access to services and experience isolation and socioeconomic disadvantage, which may lead to poorer health outcomes [41] . In addition, gaps in current services may mean that physical conditions go undiagnosed and untreated in those with mental disorders. For example, those with mental disorders are less likely to be offered standard physical health checks and routine screening for chronic conditions [41, 42] , as mental health presentations often overshadow physical health needs [43] . Diagnostic and treatment overshadowing, whereby treatment is targeted towards managing mental health symptoms rather than on comorbid physical health conditions [44] , can result in worse physical health outcomes for those with mental disorders, which may ultimately lead to premature mortality [44] .",

We also investigated different levels of PD, which enabled us to examine the dose-response relationship, in addition to the binary classification of distress. This is in line with recommendations to test more than one threshold for classifying cases [45] . Our study adjusted for numerous sociodemographic and lifestyle factors that are known to be associated with mortality. For robustness, we further stratified analyses to address residual confounding by age, sex, smoking status and physical activity. It should be noted, however, that large-scale, population-based studies may be subject to residual confounding as a result of unmeasured or poorly measured confounders. If pre-existing diseases explained the observed increases in mortality rates, it could be expected that a larger number of deaths would occur within the initial follow-up period. However, to minimize the risk of reverse causation, we excluded deaths that occurred within the first 2 years of follow-up and observed similar findings to that of the main study findings for chronic diseases, which suggests that other mechanisms are likely to be driving these associations.",

            "text": "Our findings should be interpreted in light of the study limitations. First, the K6 scale used to assess psychological symptoms was designed as a screening tool rather than a diagnostic device and is reliant on self-report data. Using this tool, we were unable to distinguish between PD and the presence of major depression. Therefore, caution should be used when drawing comparisons with studies that have assessed depression symptoms with validated clinical assessments. Second, PD symptoms are non-specific and may overlap with other mental disorders. As such, the presence of other psychiatric conditions that are reflected in distress may have influenced our risk estimates. Third, whilst our finding of increased risk of suicide mortality may be a true phenomenon, there is a possibility that this is a spurious finding based on a reasonably small number of suicide cases, which may have inflated HRs. Moreover, we may have been underpowered to detect differences in mortality owing to suicide across all four levels of PD. This may also be true for mortality due to other cause-specific outcomes (e.g. cerebrovascular disease and diabetes) whereby too few deaths may have occurred within higher levels of distress to detect a significant association. Therefore, future large-scale studies are required to corroborate these findings.",

            "text": "The prevention and treatment of mental disorders is an important public health priority, especially in the current COVID-19 setting. Suicide prevention is currently at the forefront of health promotion strategies for PD, particularly among those with higher symptoms of distress [46] . However, the increased risk of mortality attributable to chronic diseases in this study suggests that chronic disease prevention strategies also warrant attention. Our findings suggest that interventions aimed at improving physical health outcomes should be targeted towards those at lower levels of distress than currently recommended for suicide prevention (i.e. mild and moderate distress symptoms) [46] . Identifying people who are more vulnerable to the health consequences of PD through systematic screening (e.g. using the K6 scale) may improve the recognition of early PD and provide opportunities for early intervention [47] . In doing so, this may not only reduce the risk of clinically diagnosed disorders (e.g. major depression) [48] but also the risk of premature mortality. Future research should focus on the improvement of screening and development of interventions (e.g. diet, smoking and physical activity interventions) [2] aimed at mutually improving mental and physical health outcomes in those with PD. In turn, this may reduce the risk of resulting premature mortality.",
