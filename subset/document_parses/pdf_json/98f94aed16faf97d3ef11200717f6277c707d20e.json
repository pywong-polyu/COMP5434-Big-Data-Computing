Traditionally, heparin has been the primary anticoagulant utilized because of its ease of titration and familiarity of use. More recently, bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor, has attracted attention as a potential alternative to traditional therapy. While labeled for use in percutaneous coronary interventions, it is utilized off-label for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia and mechanical circulatory support. A literature search identified ten studies in which bivalirudin was used in extracorporeal membrane oxygenation and five studies in which it was used in ventricular assist devices. The purpose of this review was to summarize the currently available literature for bivalirudin use for mechanical circulatory support in both adult and pediatric patients.",

As such, and due to extensive technological advances in device therapy, the use of mechanical circulatory support (MCS) across both patient populations has expanded [1] . In patients with cardiovascular disorders, including congenital heart disease in pediatrics, MCS is often utilized when conventional therapy fails. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is useful in patients who require short-term cardiac and/or respiratory support, as it provides complete cardiopulmonary bypass [1, 2] . Meanwhile, ventricular assist devices (VADs) have served a variety of uses in patients with heart failure, including long-term use as bridging to transplantation or \"destination therapy\" in many adults. Although MCS devices have proven successful in improving quality of life and survival rates in critically ill patients, such therapy is not without complications [1] .",

            "text": "Bivalirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor (DTI), has emerged recently as an alternative therapy for patients requiring use of ECMO or VAD in which heparin is not ideal. As a DTI, bivalirudin does not require the presence of antithrombin. Instead, the drug binds simultaneously to the active catalytic site of thrombin and the substrate recognition site on both circulating and clot-bound thrombin to provide its anticoagulant effect [6, 7] . After intravenous administration, bivalirudin reaches peak plasma concentrations in approximately 2 minutes. Combined with its short half-life of 25-30 min in patients with normal renal function (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] > 60 mL/min), the pharmacokinetics of bivalirudin make it advantageous for titration or discontinuation purposes [8] . Monitoring of drug effect is most often performed through evaluation of activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), though activated clotting time (ACT) and reaction times at thromboelastography (TEG) may also be used [4] . Dose adjustment may be necessary to maintain the anticoagulation targets within range. Although such targets vary across populations and are generally center specific, aPTT is frequently utilized, and the goal range is typically 1.5-2 times the normal value for the majority of patients [1, 7] . While an in-depth comparison between bivalirudin and heparin is outside of the scope of this review, particularly given the lack of prospective comparative studies, it is vital to understand the differences between these agents. Table 1 outlines the important pharmacotherapeutic characteristics of the medications. There is some hesitation in using DTIs because of the lack of published literature and an available reversal agent. The high medication acquisition cost of bivalirudin has been another deterrent to its regular use, although studies have shown an overall reduction in total costs when including equipment changes, laboratory testing, and blood products [9, 10] . The purpose of this review is to summarize the available literature for bivalirudin during MCS in adult and pediatric patients.",

In an additional retrospective study of 11 adult patients by Netley et al. [12] , bivalirudin was initiated at a rate of 2.5 mcg/kg/min (0.15 mg/kg/h), and dose adjustment was guided by a pre-specified protocol. Despite the widely varied population characteristics, patients remained within their defined therapeutic aPTT target range for the majority of the time (66.3%), demonstrating the efficacy of a standardized protocol for bivalirudin dose adjustment across a diverse population [12] . Similarly, Kaseer et al. [13] started bivalirudin at a median dose of 0.1 mg/kg/h and reported a higher time in therapeutic range (aPTT) versus heparin therapy (50% in the heparin group vs. 85.7% in the bivalirudin group; p = 0.007). In another retrospective case report, by Jyoti et al. [14] , no loading dose was utilized, and bivalirudin was initiated at a rate of 0.6 mg/kg/h then titrated according to ACT and aPTT goals. The average dose required to maintain a target ACT of 200-220 s was 0.1-0.2 mg/kg/h, and no supplemental boluses were required [14] . Finally, in the only identified retrospective adult case report to utilize a loading dose, Koster et al. [15] reported on the initiation of bivalirudin as a heparin alternative in the incidence of HIT. In this case, bivalirudin was initiated as a 0.5 mg/kg bolus followed by a continuous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg/h to maintain an ACT of 200-220 s [15] .",

Additionally, Koster et al. [15] reported that a higher infusion rate of 0.5 mg/kg/h was necessary to maintain therapeutic ACT goals, even with the addition of a loading dose.

            "text": "In patients with unimpaired renal function, approximately 20% of the drug is cleared via the kidneys, and the remainder is cleared via proteolytic cleavage [6] . Therefore, although only a small percentage undergoes renal clearance, patients with differing renal function are likely to require various dose adjustments to maintain the same anticoagulation targets. Furthermore, Pieri et al. [4] demonstrated that, in patients with acute renal failure receiving continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH), higher doses of bivalirudin were necessary to maintain similar aPTT goals as those not receiving CVVH. As such, interpatient variability and differing renal function plays a large role in the dosing strategy of bivalirudin and should be considered when determining initial dose [4] . It may be reasonable, therefore, to initiate bivalirudin infusion at the lower end of dosing and titrate upwards to maintain pre-specified anticoagulation targets. When contemplating the use of a loading dose in bivalirudin therapy, several factors should be considered. First, only one study utilized a loading dose. In the remaining six studies discussed, therapeutic aPTT and ACT targets were reached rather quickly without need for an initial bolus. In one study, eight of eleven adult patients (72.7%) reached their pre-specified target aPTT within 14 h following the start of the infusion, and all 11 patients reached target aPTT within the first 24 h of therapy [12] . Taking into account the quick onset of bivalirudin and ease of titration, it is likely that loading doses are unnecessary except in circumstances of supposed thrombosis or increased coagulation [6, 7] .",

The longest length of use per manufacturer recommendation is up to 20 h in cases of acute coronary syndrome [16] ; however, extracorporeal life support (ECLS) may be utilized for days, and even months. Duration of anticoagulation during this time remains undefined, and prolonged anticoagulation may increase the risk of serious adverse events [5] . In the largest adult study, bivalirudin was utilized for the duration of the ECMO run, with an average run time of 156.9 h, or approximately 6.5 days [11] . In fact, most studies demonstrated an average length of ECMO therapy of 5.9-9.9 days [4, 9, 12, 14, 15] ; however, Jyoti et al. [14] reported an ECMO run time with the use of bivalirudin for 21 days. During this time, no major bleeding episodes took place, and no supplemental doses of bivalirudin were necessary to maintain anticoagulation targets [14] . Kaseer et al. [13] had a median ECMO duration of 13 days with a range of 3-70 days for their bivalirudin cohort. While there was no specific mention of these patients' outcomes, overall the bivalirudin group had similar safety outcomes as the heparin cohort [13] .",

No boluses were noted, and titrations were made in 0.05-0.1 mg/kg/h increments depending on distance from the target aPTT [10] . These authors reported that time to therapeutic anticoagulation was shorter with bivalirudin than with heparin (11 vs. 29 h; p = 0.01). Nagle et al. [7] performed a retrospective analysis that identified 12 pediatric patients utilizing bivalirudin for anticoagulation on ECMO. Four patients received a total of seven bolus doses due to suspected thrombus formation or subtherapeutic aPTT, and such doses ranged from 0.04 to 0.14 mg/kg with a median of 0.1 mg/kg. Initial bivalirudin infusion rates ranged from 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg/h, with authors reporting increased initial infusion rates as experience with bivalirudin developed. Finally, the maintenance dose required to maintain the target aPTT goal ranged from 0.045 to 0.48 mg/kg/h with a median rate of 0.16 mg/kg/h, although the target aPTT was unspecified [7] .

Due to difficulties in achieving accurate and therapeutic anti-Xa levels, heparin was discontinued 2 days following cannulation. Bivalirudin infusion was subsequently initiated at a rate of 0.3 mg/kg/h. To maintain the target aPTT of 60-80 s, a maintenance dose range of 0.2-1 mg/kg/h was utilized. Following conversion to bivalirudin, target aPTT goals were maintained for the majority of the patient's ECMO run [17] .",

In contrast to adult studies, the use of a loading dose in the pediatric population provided mixed effects on time to meet anticoagulation targets. Nagle et al. [7] reported a median time to initial goal aPTT of 4 h, with all patients meeting goal by 25 h post-infusion; however, only four of twelve patients received loading doses. In the case report by Ezetendu et al. [17] , target aPTT goal was achieved within 11 h of bivalirudin initiation. Preston et al. [18] and Pollak et al.

[7] , the average percentage of time spent within goal aPTT range and within 90-110% of goal was 47.5% and 70.3%, respectively. Meanwhile, Ezetendu et al. [17] reported an average time spent within goal of 86.7% upon switching from heparin to bivalirudin. Several points should be considered in regard to these notable differences. First, Nagle et al. [7] reported significant confounding, which resulted from a delay of approximately 90 minutes between laboratory draw and reporting of aPTT. Additionally, changes in aPTT targets occurred throughout the study period based on assessment of clinical risk, without application of a standardized protocol [7] . As mentioned, in the retrospective study of 11 adult patients performed by Netley et al. [12] , the use of a protocol for bivalirudin dose adjustment resulted in a time within therapeutic aPTT target range of 66.3%. Thus, application of such a protocol and uniform dose adjustments may have proven useful in improving time within anticoagulation targets in the study by Nagle et al. [7] . Second, the use of loading doses in Nagle et al. [7] would be expected to provide rapid escalation of the aPTT, resulting in an increased percentage of time spent within target range. However, given that bolus doses were only utilized in select patients, coupled with the lack of consistency between doses, it is not possible to analyze the impact of the loading dose on the time within therapeutic range for this population [7] .",

Current ELSO guidelines estimate survival rates of 50-60% in pediatric cardiac populations, whereas survival rates for ECMO due to pediatric respiratory failure have been described as being as high as 74% [2, 21] . Although Nagle et al. [7] demonstrated a lower rate of survival, the data provide evidence for efficacy of bivalirudin in short-term ECMO courses and supports the need for further, well-controlled studies.",

The bivalirudin group was composed of 21 patients who had received a diagnosis of HIT and were subsequently converted to argatroban, an alternative DTI. Argatroban was discontinued 6 h prior to planned surgery and bivalirudin initiated intraoperatively. A group of 36 non-HIT patients received heparin as an anticoagulant and served as the control group. In patients with pre-surgery ACT of less than 160 s, bivalirudin was initiated as a bolus of 0.5 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion rate of 0.5 mg/kg/h during LVAD implantation. In patients with a pre-surgery ACT of greater than 160 s, bivalirudin was initiated as a bolus of 0.25 mg/kg, followed by a continuous infusion rate of 0.25 mg/kg/h. Target ACT value, which was to be maintained from the beginning of LVAD attachment until initiation of the device, was 180-220 s [24] . In this study, the largest report examined, authors did not discover any statistically significant difference in the need for early (<7 days) surgical re-exploration due to persistent hemorrhage or cardiac tamponade following surgery. The incidence of delayed chest closures, stroke, and intracranial bleeding was lower in the bivalirudin study group, although this finding was not statistically significant. It should be noted that no adjustments to the initial infusion rates or additional bolus doses were required in any patients from the bivalirudin group [24] .",

Although the utility of VADs has grown, the most common use in pediatrics has remained consistent: bridge to transplantation [23] . In a study by Blume et al. [27] that included pediatric patients from as early as 1993, 77% of patients on VAD support were successfully bridged to transplant. VanderPluym et al. [28] tracked 43 patients in North America from 2013 to 2018 and found the indication for VAD was primarily bridge to transplant (72%), followed by bridge to recovery (19%), and bridge to decision (9%). As with bivalirudin use in pediatric ECMO, varying protocols, or the absence of a protocol in most cases, results in lack of standardization with regard to initial infusion rates and anticoagulation targets. A review of dosing strategies and relevant literature is provided.",

The initial infusion rate of 0.3 mg/kg/h utilized by both VanderPluym et al. [28] and Bates et al. [25] , case series reports of 43 and 14 pediatric patients, respectively, was identical to that of Nagle et al. [7] and Ezetendu et al. [17] . Meanwhile, in a case report by Medar et al.

[20] reported that the median initial rate was similar between VAD and ECMO patients, at 0.1 mg/ kg/h. Again, initial infusion rates were similar across studies, but anticoagulation targets and the average dosing required to maintain the pre-specified goals varied drastically. For example, in the largest study examined, infusion rates began at a median of 0.3 mg/kg/h, yet maximum doses necessary to maintain aPTT goals ranged from 0.1 to 3.9 mg/kg/h [28] . In the case report by Medar et al. [29] , this high variability was replicated; in one patient alone, maintenance infusion rates ranged from 0.15 to 2.3 mg/kg/h across a full VAD course of 122 days.",

Campbell et al. [20] had a less drastic but still statistically higher maximum dose in VADs versus ECMO: 0.7 and 0.44 mg/kg/h (p = 0.048), respectively. Explanations for this wide variability remain undetermined, but the pattern has been established in both adult and pediatric populations, regardless of the type of MCS. It is therefore likely that aforementioned differences in renal outcomes and patient-specific metabolism variances also play a large role in pediatric VAD patients [6] .",

Finally, a key shortcoming in this review is the lack of information regarding important details in the use of bivalirudin. Although initial infusion rates are stated in each study, maintenance infusion rates required to uphold anticoagulation targets are not consistently reported. Given the high amount of variability in titration, initial infusion rates are not necessarily reflective of actual dose requirements.

Although bivalirudin has primarily been examined as an alternative to heparin in cases of HIT or heparin resistance, evidence to date suggests possible utilization as the first-line anticoagulant in many other patients.
