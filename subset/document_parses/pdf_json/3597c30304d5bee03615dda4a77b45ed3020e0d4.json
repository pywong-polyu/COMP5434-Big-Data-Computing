This highly pathogenic virus has to date caused >71 million infections and >1.6 million deaths in >180 countries. Several vaccines and drugs are being studied as possible treatments or prophylactics of this viral infection. M3CLpro (coronavirus main cysteine protease) is a promising drug target as it has a significant role in viral replication. Here we use the X-ray crystal structure of M3CLpro in complex with boceprevir to study the dynamic changes of the protease upon ligand binding. The binding free energy was calculated for water molecules at different locations of the binding site, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were carried out for the M3CLpro/boceprevir complex, to thoroughly understand the chemical environment of the binding site. Several HCV NS3/4a protease inhibitors were tested in vitro against M3CLpro. Specifically, asunaprevir, narlaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, and telaprevir all showed inhibitory effects on M3CLpro. Molecular docking and MD simulations were then performed to investigate the effects of these ligands on M3CLpro and to provide insights into the chemical environment of the ligand binding site. Our findings and observations are offered to help guide the design of possible potent protease inhibitors and aid in coping with the COVID-19 pandemic.",

In addition, it remains to be determined if serious side effects will emerge as this new drug becomes more widely distributed. The risk of remdesivir-resistant strains of SARS-CoV-2 also remains unknown.

            "text": "As part of our effort to address the COVID-19 crisis and provide clinicians with access to therapies with multiple mechanisms of action, thereby enabling combination therapies, we have initiated a program to develop novel M3CLpro inhibitors. This essential cysteine protease is responsible for cleavage of at least 11 sites on the large polyprotein 1ab (replicase 1ab, \u223c790 kDa) that in most instances targets the recognition sequence Leu-Gln-(Ser, Ala, Gly). 21,22 X-ray crystal data (PDB 6Y2E, Figure 2) show that this enzyme is composed of three domains. 22 Domain I is a chymotrypsin-like region (residues 10\u221299), while domain II is a picornavirus 3C protease-like region (residues 100\u2212182). These domains contain six-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-barrels that together form the enzyme's active site. The last region, domain III (residues 198\u2212303), is a globular grouping of five helices that regulate dimerization of the enzyme through the formation of a salt bridge between Arg 4 of one monomer and Glu 290 of a second monomer. 23 Dimerization establishes a perpendicular orientation of the two monomers in which domain II of one monomer interacts with the NH 2 terminus (N-finger) of the other monomer over an \u223c1394 \u00c5 2 contact interface. This interaction allows the N-finger of one monomer to interact with Glu 166 of the other, which shapes the S1 pocket of the active site. 24 In the absence of dimerization, catalytic activity is limited. 23 Similar to other cysteine proteases, 25 M3CLpro cleaves its target using a Cys/His catalytic dyad, in this case Cys 145 and His 41 . In this process, the thiol of Cys 145 is deprotonated by His 41 , which facilitates its nucleophilic attack on the amide carbonyl of the target peptide. Collapse of the transient tetrahedral intermediate ejects the NH 2 -fragment peptide and produces a Cys 145 thioester, which is readily cleaved by water to release the CO 2 H fragment. This readies the active site for the next substrate. To date, there are no FDA approved therapies that target M3CLpro for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection and there are no ongoing clinical trials of lead compounds that target this enzyme. Only one company, Pfizer, has published results in this area. They recently reported the discovery of PF-07304814 (2), a prodrug of the active agent PF-00835231 (3) (Figure 1 ), that inhibits M3CLpro. Pfizer described this compound as a potential clinical candidate, but as of December 2020, clinical trials have not begun. 26 There remains a clear and compelling need for COVID-19 therapies and novel clinical candidates targeting M3CLpro.",

Fourteen drugs significantly reduced M3CLpro activity at a concentration of 100 \u03bcM, and specifically manidipine, boceprevir, lercanidipine, bedaquiline, and efonidipine showed IC 50 values of <40 \u03bcM. Similarly, Jo et al. 28 screened a flavonoid library. Rhifolin, herbacetin, and pectolinarin showed noteworthy inhibitory activity against M3CLpro. Khan et al. 29 screened anti-HIV drugs, and a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) database to find that saquinavir and five TCM drugs could be promising leads against M3CLpro.

It was FDA approved for the treatment of HCV in combination with peg-Interferon 41 and Cys 145 are shown as spheres. The color scheme is purple (I), orange (II), and cyan (III) for chain A and yellow (I*), wheat (II*), and violet (III*) for chain B. The image was prepared using PyMOL. 20 and ribavirin (2011) but was supplanted by treatments such as Harvoni and Epclusa that are more effective in eliminating HCV infection. Interestingly, boceprevir is one of the few drugs employed as a mixture of diastereomers, as the chiral center (C3) of the 3-amino-4-cyclobutyl-2-oxobutanamide residue is configurationally unstable in vivo, and hence it exists as a mixture of two interconvertible diastereomers. 32, 33 The X-ray crystal structure shows that the compound occupies the active site of M3CLpro, forms H-bonds with multiple residues (His 41 , Gly 143 , Ser 144 , His 164 , Glu 166 ), and covalently binds to Cys 145 . 31 Herein, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed to investigate the dynamic changes of the ligand binding site. Solvent mapping was carried out to compute the binding free energy of water molecules at the M3CLpro binding site. Various known HCV inhibitors were then tested in vitro against M3CLpro. On the basis of the present experimental results, asunaprevir, narlaprevir, paritaprevir, simeprevir, and telaprevir were selected for further computational analysis, with the use of molecular docking and MD simulations. The water free energy maps and MD simulations provide improved understanding of ligand recognition, binding site dynamics, and the role of ligand-interacting amino acid residues, which could aid in the rational design of therapeutics targeting M3CLpro.",

(ii) For noncovalently bound ligands, asunaprevir, simeprevir, and paritaprevir, a soft docking technique was used. Also, the Glide standard precision (SP) docking algorithm was used for asunaprevir, simeprevir, and paritaprevir. To allow for more receptor flexibility, softening the receptor potential was enabled by scaling the per-atom van der Waals radii and charges to 0.85. Cys 145 was selected as the reactive residue in the covalent docking of telaprevir and narlaprevir. The reaction type between Cys 145 and specified inhibitors was set to nucleophilic addition with a double bond inserted to allow for the reactive group of the ligands to react with \u2212SH of Cys 145 . The docking poses were refined with Prime 40 by allowing flexibility of M3CLpro residues within 10 \u00c5 of the ligand.

M3CLpro In Vitro Assay. The M3CLpro (SARS-CoV-2) assay kit (BPS Bioscience, San Diego CA, cat. no. 78042-2) is designed to measure M3CLpro activity and identify inhibitors of this enzyme. The assay was performed in a 384-well black plate using a fluorogenic substrate. Briefly, a solution of M3CLpro was prepared according to the manufacturer's protocol in assay buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.01% BSA, 1 mM DTT) such that 10 \u03bcL added per well will provide 15 ng of M3CLpro. Separately, solutions of test compounds necessary to generate an eight-point dose response curve were prepared in half-log serial dilution (1 mM stock solution, 100 \u03bcM highest assay concentration). Test compounds were added to the plate, and the mixture was preincubated for 30 min at room temperature (slow shaking). A blank well (no enzyme) was included to assess the background signal, while the known inhibitor GC376 (IC 50 = 80 nM) was used as a positive control. The reaction was initiated by the addition of 12.5 \u03bcL of a solution of the fluorogenic substrate (40 \u03bcM in assay buffer). Total assay volume was 25 \u03bcL. The plate was incubated for 4 h at room temperature, and then fluorescence intensity was measured in a ClarioSTAR plate reader (BMG Labtech Inc., Cary, NC) (excitation 360 nm, emission 460 nm). End point fluorescence intensity was measured, and the (Figure 2 ).

Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling pubs.acs.org/jcim Article Therefore, the hydration sites were mapped computationally over the surface of M3CLpro using SZMAP 55 (solvent-Zapmapping), a semiexplicit solvent mapping technique. The net free energy of desolvation (dehydration) of the protein and ligand is a good indicator of the favorable and unfavorable contribution to protein\u2212ligand binding. The binding free energies for water molecules in the binding sites were computed to identify positive (unfavorable) and negative (favorable) hydration sites. Water molecules in favorable hydration sites are tightly bound in the complex with strong electrostatic interactions, while unfavorable hydration sites show weak electrostatic interactions. It is necessary to identify these regions in the binding site to improve ligand design. Analysis of the binding site showed a pronounced stable hydration shell close to the side chains of Glu 166 and His 172 . A cluster of water molecules of negative free energy is located at this site with \u0394G in the range \u22128.1 to \u22124.7 kcal/mol. Two smaller stable hydration sites are present: the first is close to the backbone of Glu 166 and side chain of Met 165 ; the second is close to Asn 142 , Gly 143 , and Cys 145 . These clusters ( Figure  5 ) define the areas at which polar ligand groups could replace or interact with the solvent to enhance binding affinity, while hydrophobic groups would hurt binding. Boceprevir exploits the chemistry of the active site and replaces 12 water molecules with its polar atoms (oxygen and nitrogen atoms). An electrostatic mismatch was identified, however, as the tertbutyl group replaces a stable water molecule (W1, Figure  5B ). Positive free energy hydration sites were identified throughout the binding site ( Figure 6) , with a major cluster of unfavorable hydration shell in the region surrounded by His 41 , Met 49 , His 164 , and Asp 187 . The free energy of these unstable hydration sites ranged from 0.8 to 2.1 kcal/mol. Hydrophobic ligand groups at these sites should improve the binding affinity. The nonpolar groups of boceprevir are wellmapped with these regions.",

The first MD system was constructed with the covalently bound boceprevir, and in the second system, the covalent bond between boceprevir and Cys 145 was broken. Analysis of the MD simulations showed that in the first system the loop composed of amino acid residues of 186\u2212198 covering the substituted urea moiety of boceprevir moved away from its original position at the end of MD simulation ( Figure S1 ). As shown in Figure 7A ,B, shifting of this loop caused Gln 189 to lose its hydrogen bonding with the urea oxygen of the boceprevir. The initial distance between the centers of mass (COMs) of Gln 189 and urea oxygen increased from \u223c5 to \u223c12 \u00c5 by the end of MD simulation ( Figure S2 ). Although the hydrogen bonding was lost, Gln 189 maintained watermediated interactions with boceprevir. The loop opening facilitated access of water molecules between the loop and boceprevir ( Figure 7A,B) .

Moreover, the interaction strengths of these amino acid residues were boceprevir were similar in the beginning and at the end of the simulation. Glu 166 had the most dominant and stable interactions with boceprevir throughout the MD simulation time. The same amino acid residue participated in three hydrogen bonds with boceprevir. The interaction of Gly 143 with boceprevir increased significantly in the last 100 ns compared to the initial 1 ns, whereas His 41 experienced a 50% decrease in hydrogen bonding during the last 100 ns. Compared to system 1, there were no significant changes in the positions of boceprevir and the loops around the binding cavity by the end of 400 ns simulation ( Figure S4B ). In general, covalently bound boceprevir (the first system) interacts with more residues with greater magnitude of binding compared to noncovalently bound boceprevir (the second system), which explains in part why covalently bound boceprevir is the favorable binding mode.",

Region A can be modified to a small or a simple ring system, and B should be a slightly bulky substituent to fit into the hydrophobic cleft. Region C carries the warhead group to interact with Cys 145 and can be modified to hold the hydrogen bond donor/ acceptor group for noncovalent binders.
