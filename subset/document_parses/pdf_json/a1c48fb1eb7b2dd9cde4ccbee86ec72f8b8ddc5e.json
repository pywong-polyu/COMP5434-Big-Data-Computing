In England, over half of excess mortality in the first months of 2020 is estimated to have been in this setting. 1 Surveillance of COVID-19 in care homes has been difficult, because of a paucity of testing, and the lack of experience with how this disease presents in older people. 2 An increasing number of UK care homes now collect National Early Warning Score (NEWS). This tool (originally developed by the Royal College of Physicians in 2012, 3 and updated in 2017) 4 is used in hospitals in the UK to identify patients at risk of acute deterioration and improve patient safety. NEWS requires the measurement of six simple physiological parameters: temperature, pulse, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate and oxygen saturation and level of consciousness or new confusion. The score generated should trigger a prespecified response, ranging from repeating the score within a specific timeframe, to seeking urgent medical attention. 5 The British Geriatrics Society produced guidelines for managing COVID-19 in care",

To support triage, they recommend training staff to measure a resident's vital signs (temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, pulse oximetry and respiratory rate) when COVID-19 infection is suspected. 6 The risks and benefits of this approach are unknown. In community settings, elevated NEWS scores have been associated with prompt review by a health professional and poor health outcomes. 7 Evidence to support the use of NEWS in care homes is limited, and whether it can support care home staff to identify or predict deterioration in the health of residents is unclear. [8] [9] [10] [11] NEWS observations, particularly measurement of blood pressure, require close contact between residents and care home workers, which may transmit COVID-19 infection. This study will address the dearth of published evidence on the use of NEWS in any setting during the COVID-19 pandemic. 12 The aim is to describe change in NEWS and its components over time and align these data with COVID-19 and all-cause mortality in care homes in England. We address the question of whether NEWS can contribute to surveillance during the pandemic, and whether an abbreviated NEWS (excluding one or more of the component measures) would suffice.",

These cut points were then validated in the remaining 30% of observations made before March 2020. NEWS scores above the 80th centile score were defined as above-baseline. For individual physiological observations, upper and lower thresholds were established using the 80th and 20th centile measurements in the same random subset (we calculated the lowest 20th centile only for oxygen saturation: only lower values indicate a health problem). These cut points represent markers of increase in each parameter at a population level and are not measures of clinical concern at the individual resident level, which are defined elsewhere. 4 We removed biologically implausible values from the data set before creating the centile cut points (online supplemental table 1). We used quantile regression to measure the impact of age and sex on centile scores but did not find evidence to support age/sex specific 20th and 80th centile cut points in this population (details available from the authors on request).",

A rise in the proportion of abovebaseline NEWS was observed from the middle of March 2020, when the incidence of COVID-19 was believed to be rising in the UK. The proportion of above-baseline Open access measurements of oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature also increased approximately 2 weeks before peaks in care home deaths in corresponding geographical areas. Oxygen saturation and respiratory rate appear to signal rise in mortality almost as well as total NEWS and may be safer and more practical to measure during a pandemic.",

This is similar to the observed time between symptom onset and COVID-19 death in other settings. 16 17 Evidence for the role of NEWS in acute illness in community settings is growing, 11 18-22 but to date, only one descriptive study has provided empirical data on NEWS in care homes. 8 A recent systematic review on the use of NEWS in assessing unwell COVID-19 patients in primary care suggested that enthusiasm for its use may be premature. 12 Limitations of this study mean that we cannot draw direct conclusions about the role of NEWS (or its component parameters) in the care of individual residents: further study would be needed to address this question. However, it suggests a role for NEWS in COVID-19 disease surveillance at a care home population level in the pandemic. Measurement and monitoring of some NEWS components may be useful in detecting future waves of COVID-19 infection in care homes. Emerging evidence suggests that up to half of care home residents do not have symptoms at the time they test positive for COVID-19. 23 Whether NEWS measurement could signal impending illness in any of these residents at the individual level is unclear, and we do not believe it should substitute for a comprehensive programme of testing in care homes. Recent work has shown the value of routinely collected information to target resources during the COVID-19 pandemic, 24 and our study strengthens the case for further work to evaluate the role of NEWS in the care of individual residents.",

We have described trends over time in NEWS recorded using a specific software system used to collect data on NEWS in some care homes. This means that the distribution of care homes within and between areas is not systematic, as it reflects the market share of the software company and local support for digital data collection in care homes. Most recordings were drawn from the north east of England, and a London borough, but we have no information on the proportion of care home residents in each area that are represented in our data set. All data were anonymised, and without individual outcome data, we examined patterns in and simple correlations between NEWS and area-level weekly registered death information. We were not able to independently assess or verify the accuracy of NEWS measurements made by care home staff using the specific commercial software, and acknowledge that even where training is sufficient, the accuracy of vital sign measurement such as respiratory rate can be suboptimal. 25 However, our approach using 20th/80th centile scores will have ameliorated some of the impact of potential inaccuracies, and we caution against using single observations in isolation. Furthermore, we removed a small number of biologically implausible values and provide a summary of the number of values removed in online supplemental table 1. This study design was a pragmatic approach that made best use of available data, but it is not a causal study, nor a study of diagnostic accuracy and it is liable to the ecological fallacy.",

Use of a shortened NEWS could be recommended for care home population surveillance where COVID-19 is of primary concern (but not for individual care due to the risk of underestimating the severity of non-respiratory illness). Oxygen saturation, respiratory rate and temperature provide a similar signal to the complete NEWS. The omission of some components of NEWS, such as blood pressure, minimises contact time between residents and care home staff, potentially reducing infection risk where this is of primary concern. Data on mortality and diagnoses, linked to NEWS, are required to evaluate the role of NEWS in assessing individual residents with suspected COVID-19 infection. Collection and aggregation of data from care homes would facilitate disease surveillance; we argue that introduction of a care home minimum dataset should be a priority for the UK.",
