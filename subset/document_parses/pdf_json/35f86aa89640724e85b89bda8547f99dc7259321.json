The pathophysiology of these findings is not fully established, although information available to date shows that the changes in the hemostasis system seem to be triggered by the high production of proinflammatory cytokines [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . The massive production of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1, among others, leads to a parallel increase in fibrinolysis inhibitors, such as plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) and thrombin activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI), increased expression of tissue factor by circulating mononuclear cells and release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) [1, [4] [5] [6] .",

However, these methods present several limitations because they only cover the initial phase of coagulation and do not evaluate the different components involved in the dynamics of clot formation. In this sense, viscoelastic methods traditionally used to monitor hemorrhagic disturbances have emerged as a possible tool for assessing the hemostasis profile in the thrombotic pole of blood coagulation disorders [8, 9] . Indeed, reduced clotting time (CT) and increased maximum clot firmness (MCF) have been used to characterize hypercoagulability conditions [10] [11] [12] . In this scenario, the thrombodynamic potential index (TPI) [10] constitutes an alternative parameter for monitoring the risk of thromboembolic events by representing the global coagulation process [8, 9, 13] .",

Even in severe patients, the effects of pathophysiologic alterations on the initial stages of hemostasis have not been determined.

After recalcification and addition of a specific activator (depending upon the test), the clotting starts, and as it becomes firmer, the spinning capacity of the axis is reduced, which is transformed by the system in a graphic representation of the clot, with increasing amplitude. As fibrinolysis starts, the clot becomes less firm, which is represented as a decreasing amplitude on the monitor. EXTEM: thromboplastin is the activator, and it evaluates the extrinsic activation of coagulation; INTEM: elagic acid is the activator, and it evaluates the intrinsic activation of coagulation; FIBTEM: thromboplastin and cytochalasin D (which inhibits platelet activity) are added, and it only depicts the participation of fibrinogen in the clot; and NATEM: recalcified blood with no activator, it performs a nonactivated evaluation of coagulation. Circulating tissue factors, such as those expressed on monocytes in inflammatory states, will start the coagulation process. CT represents the clotting time (expressed in seconds), which is the timeframe from activation until an amplitude of 2 mm, and indicates thrombin formation; ALPHA (expressed in ) is defined as the angle between the middle axis and the tangent to the clotting curve through the 2 mm amplitude point and represents the dynamic polymerization of fibrin; CFT represents clot formation time(expressed in seconds) and indicates the dynamic polymerization of fibrin, and it is the timeframe between 2 mm and 20 mm of clot amplitude; MCF represents maximum clot firmness (expressed in mm), and it indicates the maximum amplitude of the clot and represents its main constituents, namely, fibrinogen and platelets; ML represents maximum lysis (expressed in %), and it indicates the percentage of clot reduction after initiation of fibrinolysis.

The decision trees were constructed using the cutoff values defined by the ROC curve analysis (Tables 2 and 3 ).

The stepwise analysis to classify HC vs COVID-19 comprises two consecutive analyses, including FIBTEM-MCF followed by EXTEM-CT. In the first round of analysis, it was possible to precisely classify 28 out of 41 COVID-19 patients with one misclassification of HC as COVID-19. Samples with FIBTEM-MCF below or equal to 22 mm were further analyzed for the EXTEM-CT profile. The results of EXTEM-CT below or equal to 66 seconds classified 08/08 as HC and misclassified 09/13 COVID patients (Fig 5A) . Overall, the stepwise analysis correctly classified 40 out of 50 subjects. The stepwise algorithm for classifying HC vs NS consists of EXTEM-CT followed by NATEM-CT. In the first step, the decision tree accurately classified 08 out of 20 nonsevere COVID-19 patients with no misclassification. Samples with EXTEM-CT below or equal to 66 seconds were moved forward to the NATEM-CT analysis. NATEM-CT results below or equal to 223 seconds were used to classify 07/12 as NS, with no misclassification. Samples with NATEM-CT higher than 223 seconds were categorized as HC, with 5 misclassifications ( Fig  5B) . The final analysis correctly classified 24 out of 29 subjects.

Our findings showed a clear hypercoagulant profile in severe forms of COVID-19 based on the evaluation of EXTEM parameters, as previously described [7, 16] . A single parameter (EXTEM-CT) did not fulfill the hypercoagulability diagnosis, with values in the normal range [14] . However, all INTEM parameters, even CT, which is known to be more heparin-sensitive, support a clear hypercoagulant pattern in severe COVID-19 [26] . Since heparin thromboprophylaxis was administered to 90% of severe patients included in the present investigation and they still presented a clear INTEM hypercoagulability profile, we hypothesize that heparin therapy in usual doses may not have been sufficient to control the thrombotic tendency in severe COVID-19 patients and that INTEM analysis may represent a relevant biomarker to predict and adjust thromboprophylaxis management in COVID-19 patients, even knowing that INTEM is not highly sensitive to LMWH [25] [26] [27] . Further studies with a larger number of patients are necessary to confirm the applicability of INTEM-CT as a biomarker for insufficient anticoagulation therapy.",

Altered NATEM profiles have been well described in patients with bacterial sepsis [17] [18] [19] . In septic patients, the induction of tissue factor (TF) expression in circulating mononuclear cells may explain the occurrence of disseminated thrombi and multiple organ failure [17] [18] [19] . As no specific activator is added in the NATEM assay, the production of thrombin will be triggered by pre-existing circulating TF. Our results showed that both severe and nonsevere COVID-19 patients presented altered NATEM profiles, which were characterized by shortening of CT. As the nonsevere patients exhibited this thromboelastometric parameter (NATEM-CT) suggestive of incipient hypercoagulopathy, our results suggested that even patients not hospitalized with nonsevere forms of COVID-19 may present a risk of developing thromboembolic events, which is probably due to increased levels of circulating TF expression. Additional studies of nonsevere patients may confirm whether altered NATEM-CT would represent a thromboelastometric parameter useful as a predictor of worse clinical evolution, thereby allowing for earlier intervention to avoid evolution to more severe clinical forms.",
