            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic raised concerns about the exponential growth of intimate partner violence (IPV), both in numbers and severity. This brief report aims to describe the variation of IPV reports to the police during the pandemic in Portugal. Data were retrieved from a governmental national database. A five-year period was analyzed. Characteristics from the occurrence, as well as sociodemographic characteristics of victims and perpetrators, were described for each year. Data showed a 10.99% decrease of IPV reports to the police in 2020 compared with the average of the previous four years. Periods when more restrictive measures (e.g., lockdown) were decreed by the government corresponded to a higher decrease in IPV reports to the police. Significant differences in the distribution of crime location, crime reporting, type of violence, age of victims and perpetrators, and professional situation and financial dependence of perpetrators, were found between 2020 and previous years. COVID-19 pandemic does not seem to be associated with a raise in IPV reports to the police, nor higher severity of the reported cases. This brief report adds to previous research by providing detailed and systematically collected data about IPV occurrences during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Changes caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in our societies were probably one of the major challenges that all countries had to face throughout the last decades. Restrictions imposed by sanitary measures, although necessary, revealed unintended socioeconomic consequences (e.g., the raising of economic uncertainty, unemployment, and social isolation). Also, more time spent at home by victims and their abusers are among these consequences. All of these are known risk factors for intimate partner violence (IPV; Campbell, 2020; Galea et al., 2020; Usher et al., 2020) . Furthermore, evidence gathered by the European Institute for Gender Equality (EIGE, 2020) revealed that previous crises (e.g., other pandemics, natural disasters), have increased the prevalence and severity of domestic violence against women. Therefore, a possible increase in IPV occurrences during the COVID-19 pandemic became a major concern and the United Nations Secretary-General called for countries to prioritize actions to monitor and support victims (Guterres, 2020) . Concerns raised by several stakeholders included not only an exponential growth of IPV, but also that these forms of violence would become more severe, and victims would not be able to ask for help (Campbell, 2020; Galea et al., 2020; Konnoth, 2020; Mahase, 2020; Salerno et al., 2020) . These concerns were well-founded and, initially, many reports from different countries seemed to confirm them (Boserup et al., 2020; Sharma & Borah, 2020; Usher et al., 2020) . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), during April 2020, there was a 60% increase in emergency calls by women victims of IPV in Europe (Mahase, 2020) . EIGE (2020) found consistent findings, with most of the support services consulted reporting an increase in demand during COVID-19. The UK reported an increase of 25% in the hotlines' calls for domestic violence (DV), including IPV (Kelly & Morgan, 2020) , and France estimated an increase of up to 36% in the DV complaints (Reuters News Agency, 2020) . In Portugal, an increase of 180% of hotline calls and a worsening of IPV cases previously in attendance were also reported (Ag\u00eancia Lusa, 2020 ). An online survey focused on domestic violence (Gama, et al., 2021) found that 6.5% of participants (men and women) reported they had been victims of IPV during the pandemic (from up to October 2020). However, it is not possible to compare these findings with those of previous research that estimated national IPV past-year victimization for women around 19% (European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [FRA] , 2014), due to differences in the assessment methodology and sample composition. The tendency to an increasing in help requests has also been identified in other parts of the world. For instance, Australia described an increase of 40% of help requests to frontline workers (Lattouf, 2020) , and Brazil presented estimates of a 50% increase in DV (Campbell, 2020) . In the US, calls for DV to the police increased up to 25% during March 2020 (Boserup et al., 2020) , and China reported that DV situations have tripled during the lockdown measures (Campbell, 2020) . Nevertheless, the large majority of these reports are anecdotal pieces of evidence or gray literature (e.g., Campbell, 2020; Kelly & Morgan, 2020; Peterman et al., 2020; Sharma & Borah, 2020; Usher et al., 2020; Wanqing, 2020) .",

            "text": "Different findings emerged from studies based in police reports. identified a brief spike in domestic violence reports in Dallas, Texas, including IPV, followed by a decrease immediately after. However, the authors warn that this increase had already been detected before stay-at-home measures were enacted, and it was not clear that they were associated. Other studies failed to find evidence about the impact of the pandemic-associated measures on the report of IPV crimes (Ashby, 2020; Campedelli, et al., 2020; Payne, et al., 2020) . Two scenarios might provide an explanation for this: (1) the lack of impact or the decrease in IPV reports was due to a greater difficulty or fear of victims to report or ask for help during lockdowns (Ashby, 2020), and if that was the case, one would hope an increase (delayed) of reports by the end of stay-at-home and lockdowns measures (Campedelli et al., 2020) or (2) there was a real decrease in the number of IPV occurrences and, therefore, no abnormal increase in IPV reports would be identified by the end of those measures. Despite some limitations (e.g., it has been argued that samples from police records tend to underreport violence cases and/or bias conclusions about the range of the phenomenon by especially identifying more severe forms of IPV) (e.g., Hamel, 2018; Meyer & Frost, 2019) , police reports are a relevant contribution to assess the impact of COVID-19 on the prevalence and severity of IPV.",

More reliable information will allow for better adjustment of policies and measures to protect victims and intervene with perpetrators. This brief report aims to describe the variation on IPV reports to the police since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, including during and after the period of lockdown and stay-at-home measures in Portugal, in comparison with data from previous years. It is worth mentioning that, in Portugal, IPV is a crime of mandatory report, and it is one of the most reported each year. Almost all reports are made to the PSP and to the National Republican Guard (GNR), both having specialized teams trained to handle IPV situations. The number of complaints made to other police agencies (e.g., Foreigners and Border Service) or directly to the Public Prosecutor's Office is negligible (Sistema de Seguran\u00e7a Interna, 2021). Depending on the outcome of the abuse, the prison sentence can be from 2 to 10 years. Victim support services are provided by both independent NGOs and government-funded offices that cover the entire country and have been operating helplines and hotlines for several years. During the pandemic, these lines were widely publicized through awareness campaigns and a new phone number was set up to allow people to ask for help by text message. On the part of the PSP, a specific email was also released and publicized for this purpose during this period, resulting in 34 reports.",

These data corresponded to the jurisdiction area of the Public Security Police (PSP), which covers mainly urban areas, more densely populated. PSP is one of the two main Portuguese law enforcement agencies, and it was responsible for monitoring from 48.47% to 40.46% (44.97% in average) of the IPV crimes from 2016 to 2020. This database allowed to analyze data according to the situational characteristics of the crime and the date of occurrence. Five years were analyzed (from 2016 to 2020). This was done considering that the last change in the domestic violence law came into force in November 2015, and that there is a tendency for reported cases to fluctuate annually (IPV tends to increase whenever vacation periods (e.g., summer), or festive dates (e.g., Carnival, Christmas, and New Year's Eve) approach) (Sistema de Seguran\u00e7a Interna, 2021). Variables were extracted based on the date of the crime, even if reported later (Portuguese law allows the report of this crime up to six months). Observations were grouped fortnightly by month, in each year. According to Portuguese law, violence types are identified as physical (e.g., to hit), psychological (e.g., to humiliate), sexual (e.g., coerce to have sex), economic (e.g., do not allow access to the salary), and social (e.g., defamation via social media). Each occurrence refers to a situation between a couple or former couple (victim and perpetrator) and may include different types of violence. \"Occurrences where more than one victim is identified\" refers to situations in which other people (e.g., children) were victimized (further than exposed) in that situation.",

The emergency state corresponded to the more restrictive period and included measures of mandatory stay-at-home, and lockdown (e.g., schools, shops, cafes, restaurants), except for those establishments selling basic needs products, and health and security services. The contingency/calamity period did not include mandatory stay-at-home measures but restricted the normal activity of commerce and movement of people, with curfew and closure of night entertainment establishments after 8 pm, and mandatory curfew on weekends. Data analysis took into consideration these different periods, as they seem to represent real changes in population routines. Indirect indicators (e.g., decreased mobility; PSE, 2021) suggest a good adherence of the Portuguese population to these measures. In urban areas, during 2020, the PSP made only 424 arrests and applied 3206 fines for non-compliance. The database was lastly accessed on March 29 th , 2021.

Findings are different from those of other countries (Ashby, 2020; Campedelli, et al., 2020; Payne, et al., 2020) , showing a decrease in the overall number of IPV reports to the Police during the pandemic period in 2020. This decrease of IPV reports in Portuguese urban areas, is aligned with the decrease of 5.5% in total reports regarding IPV in Portugal during 2020 (Sistema de Seguran\u00e7a Interna, 2021), pointing to an overall tendency across the country. Fluctuations in the reports are expectable (Sistema de Seguran\u00e7a Interna, 2021) and were found across all years for the different analyzed variables. Regarding the year 2020, important differences to be noticed are a higher percentage of crimes occurred at home, and an increase in the occurrences where more than one victim is identified. These findings are congruent with the social context of lockdown and stay-at-home measures, in which families tend to pass more time together, at home. In comparison with the previous years, there seems to be a higher percentage of older victims and perpetrators. This finding reinforces the hypothesis of greater vulnerability of older people during the pandemic, urging for special attention to these age groups. It is also worth noting that, while fewer complaints were filed in person or by telephone than in previous years, a higher percentage of complaints was filed through community policing and other means. Concurrently, emergency and contingency/calamity periods have the lowest numbers of IPV reports of the past five years. At first, these data do not allow ruling out the possibility that victims had difficulties asking for help during the pandemic period. The suggestion that the pandemic could exacerbate the use of strategies to control the victims, preventing them from pressing charges, could explain the decrease of IPV reports. On the other hand, stay-at-home and lockdown measures and circulation restrictions, with the existence of mandatory curfew, promoted easier control from perpetrators over victims, once both should have remained in the same space for a longer time. That could appease the need to resort to overt control strategies, thus diminishing conflicts, meaning a real decrease in some types of violence. Even so, this does not mean the resolution of dysfunctional dynamics within these couples, nor the eradication of violence. When analyzing the period after the end of lockdown measures, there are increases in IPV reports. These increases do not surpass the numbers of previous years, considering the same months.",

            "text": "To be notice that the increases in IPV reports after the lockdown periods, cannot be attributed to occurrences during the lockdown, because this work analyzes reports based on the date of occurrence and not on the date of the contact with the police. Therefore, more complex explanations about the lower number of IPV reports to the police should be drawn. First, this decrease in IPV reports while more restrictive measures were in place could reflect the decrease of physical violence, but not necessarily the decrease of other types of violence. Indeed, the percentage of police reports in 2020 seems to point out less physical violence, but more psychological and social violence (that seems to be the type of violence that increased the most, in proportion, in 2020). Also, the periods with higher decreases in IPV reports overlapped with the periods when lockdown measures restrained the activity of entertainment spaces (e.g., restaurants, bars, clubs). The absence of alcohol consumption in these social settings and/or fewer interactions that might trigger jealousy, known to be risk factors for IPV (Capaldi et al., 2012) , might help to explain, at least partially, this overlap. Another important remark is that most of IPV reports to the police in the previous years were done by the victims and the same occurred in 2020, despite fears that victims would not be able to call for help during lockdown periods. However, the lower proportion of reports being made in person or by phone, and the higher percentage of complaints filed through community policing, might indicate that greater control was exercised over the victims by the perpetrators, and victims had to resort to other available means to seek for help. Additionally, the number of occurrences without previous reports is also the lowest number of the five years under study, pointing to a decrease in new IPV cases in Portuguese urban areas during 2020. Regarding violence severity, and despite data from police being known for identifying the most severe cases of violence, most of the occurrences reported did not result in injuries in any of the analyzed years. Even so, the percentage of reports without injuries was significantly higher in 2020 than in previous years, and the percentage of reports identifying minor injuries was lower. Furthermore, no differences were identified regarding the percentage of occurrences where there was a need to transport the victim to the hospital. These findings do not seem to support the concern that the severity of IPV would increase during 2020. Nonetheless, the psychological and emotional consequences of non-physical forms of violence are not to be ignored or minimized, and the rise of social violence should be tackled.",

Regarding significant differences found concerning the characteristics of occurrence and of those involved, it should also be noted that only low effect sizes were present, and some CI overlapped. Therefore, the findings of this brief report should be seen as indicative and should be validated against survey-based measures of victimization and/ or qualitative data on victims' experiences during this period.

It also allows for comparisons within 5 years, as opposed to anecdotal reports that do not include these comparisons and/or ignore the usual fluctuation in crime reports across time. Finally, this study's findings may prompt future research allowing for a greater understanding of the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic, lockdown/stay-at-home measures, and IPV reports to the police.
