This novel coronavirus reportedly had symptoms resembling that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (SARS-CoV) seen in the year 2003 [3] . Both these viruses share almost 70% of the amino acid sequences and use the same receptor-which is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [4] to gain entry into the cells. Hence, this virus was named SARS-CoV-2. In February 2020, the World Health Organization named the disease as coronavirus disease 2019 .",

They tend to mutate and adapt quickly to cross the species barrier, which occurred with SARS-CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), causing epidemics and pandemics. Infection with these viruses in humans often leads to severe clinical symptoms with high mortality [5] . All three of these novel viruses (SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19, and MERS-CoV) originate from zoonotic transmission. These are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA corona viruses in the betacoronoviride family. Studies had demonstrated that the clinical course of SARS and MERS was highly similar and SARS and MERS may have similar pathogenesis [6] . The genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2 also shows some similarities to that of MERS-CoV. The postulated common pathophysiologic mechanisms include dysregulation of cytokines/ chemokines, deficiencies in the innate immune response, direct infection of immune cells, direct viral cytopathic effects, and autoimmunity [7] . MERS-CoV infects cells by binding to the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 receptor, and SARS-CoV acts via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 receptor [8] .",

A recently published study that looked at 214 cases of severe coronavirus illness treated in Wuhan during the early phase of the global pandemic reported that about 36% of patients displayed neurological symptoms [11] . This study reports that strokes, altered consciousness, and other neurological issues are relatively common in serious cases of COVID-19. These include both direct and indirect involvement of the nervous system. Following this study, there have been several case reports of various neurologic diagnoses. The reported manifestations include anosmia, ageusia, stroke, AIDP, acute necrotizing hemorrhagic encephalopathy, toxic-metabolic encephalopathy, headache, myalgia, central respiratory failure, myelitis, ataxia, and various neuropsychiatric manifestations.",

So far, there have been numerous publications about the association of loss of smell and taste with COVID-19 infection. Post-viral anosmia is one of the leading causes of loss of sense of smell in adults. This post-viral loss of smell is thought to be secondary to initial congestion of the nose, which leads to loss of fine hair like endings of the olfactory receptor cells causing them to be ineffective in picking up odor molecules from the nose. SARS-CoV-2 also appears to be highly concentrated in the nostrils of affected patients causing inflammation of the olfactory nerves and structural damage to the receptors and thereby causing anosmia [13] . Studies have shown that the tongue has a very high expression of ACE2 receptors compared to buccal and gingival tissues, thereby posing a high risk of viral binding and ageusia from taste receptor damage [14] .",

Some of the respiratory symptoms due to the disease might actually be secondary to respiratory center involvement controlled by the nervous system. According to Yan-Chao Li, et al. [15] , SARS-CoV-2 infects nerve cells, particularly the neurons in the medulla oblongata, which serves as the control center for the heart and the lungs. The damage to this area could contribute to the acute respiratory failure of patients with COVID-19. Autopsy results of patients with COVID-19 showed that the brain tissue near brainstem was hyperemic and edematous with neuronal degeneration [16] . By contrast, there have been a few case reports which mention no penetrance of virus into the central nervous system as evidenced by the absence of SARS-CoV-2 in CSF and that the CNS effects are secondary to elevated inflammatory markers as CSF analyses during the acute stage showed pleocytosis with increased IL-8 and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations [17] .",

There are at least a couple of ways that the virus could invade the central nervous system-it might circulate through the blood and then attack ACE2 receptors in the endothelia that line blood capillaries in the brain, breaching the blood-brain barrier and invading neurons through that route (Fig. 1) . A breached blood-brain barrier could also cause brain swelling, compressing the brain stem there by affecting respiration. Apart from these two mechanisms, it has also been demonstrated that some coronaviruses can spread by synaptic transfer from chemoreceptors and mechanoreceptors in lung to the medullary cardiorespiratory center [19] . This process could be an implicating factor in acute onset respiratory failure in some of the COVID-19 patients [20] .",

Considering the temporal association, it was speculated that SARS-CoV-2 infection might have been responsible for the development of AIDP. Following this, a case series from Italy, published by Toscano et al., reported five cases of AIDP that started after the onset of COVID-19 disease [22] . Around the same time, two case reports were published from Spain reporting the occurrence of Miller Fisher syndrome and polyneuritis cranialis in patients diagnosed with COVID-19 [23] .

Patients with severe infection had higher D-dimer levels than that of patients with the non-severe infection, which may be the reason why patients with severe infection are more likely to develop the cerebrovascular disease. Apart from the elevated d-dimer causing a state of altered coagulation cascade, there is also a theory that there is a vasculitis type of picture created secondary to intracranial cytokine storm versus the infection by the virus itself which are believed to be the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms behind stroke/cerebrovascular accident [32] . The virus can get access to cerebral circulation from systemic circulation, attach to endothelium ACE2 receptors, and cause endothelial ruptures and thrombus [33] . Slow cerebral circulation compared to systemic circulation pose an increased risk of replication and rupture. Also, the virus can get into brain tissue from capillary endothelium by brain-blood barrier disruption and cause neuronal damage without much inflammation (Fig. 1) .",

In the acute phase, apart from being the psychosocial stressor, COVID-19 has been reported to cause neuropsychiatric manifestations, like encephalopathy, psychosis, insomnia, and mood changes. Post-traumatic stress disorder, panic attacks, anxiety are mostly seen in health care workers and survivors of SARS CoV infection [36] .

In the absence of direct viral infiltration, peripheral hypercytokinaemia causing an imbalance of neurotransmitters within the central nervous system has been implicated in neuropsychiatric manifestations. The state of hypercytokinaemia triggers a neuro-inflammatory response causing disruption of the blood-brain barrier, leading to peripheral immune cell transmigration into the central nervous system and, in turn, causing imbalances in neurotransmission [41] .",
