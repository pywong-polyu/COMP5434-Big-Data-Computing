The surveys use multiple tests on participants to gather evidence of both past infection and active infection. For example, the recently concluded first round of the Karnataka state COVID-19 serosurvey [1] involved three kinds of tests on participants: the serological test on serum of venous blood for detection of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies, the rapid antigen detection test (RAT), and the quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) test for detection of viral RNA. The tests provide different kinds of information, e.g. past infection or active infection. The tests have remarkable variation in reliability, e.g., the RAT has sensitivity (i.e probability of a positive test given that the patient has the disease.) of about 50% while the RTPCR test has a sensitivity of 95% or higher (assuming no sample collection-or transportation-related issues); there is variation, albeit less spectacular, in specificities (i.e probability of a negative test given that the patient is well.). The test costs also vary, e.g., the RAT cost was Rs. 450 while the RTPCR test cost was Rs. 1600 on 10 December 2020. Conducting all three tests on each participant is ideal but can lead to high cost.",

In our first result, Theorem 1, we show the existence of a c-optimal design. We then consider a worst-case design in Theorem 2, optimal design of surveys conducted across different strata in Theorem 3, and optimal design when additional information about the participants such as symptoms are observed in Theorem 4. We also present numerical examples 2 illustrating the applicability of the theorems, see in particular Table 3 in Section 1.2.

We are now ready to state our main results. 1. The c-optimal design. By the asymptotic optimality property, the estimated total burden u Tp is approximately Gaussian with mean u T p and variance u T t\u2208T w t I t (p) \u22121 u. This suggests the use of the so-called local c-optimal design criterion. The adjective 'local' refers to local optimality at p and the criterion is called c-optimal because the variance of c Tp was minimised, for a vector c, in [11, Chapter 5] .. Accuracy of the estimate is generally a combination of precision (narrow confidence intervals) and unbiasedness. Broadly speaking, given a budget, c-optimal design attempts to resolve the tension between the accuracy of the estimate and cost efficiency. We shall refer to a survey design (w * t , t \u2208 T ) as c-optimal if it minimizes the variance",

A subset t may be highly informative, i.e., u T I t (p) \u22121 u may be small, yet t may not be attractive when relativised by its cost c t because what ultimately matters is u T (I t (p)/c t ) \u22121 u; see (4) . Section 2 contains the proof with additional structural results on the support of the solution. The last statement of the theorem gives the level of accuracy 5 (asymptotic variance of the rescaled estimate) that the budget can buy: accuracy is inversely proportional to the budget. It also suggests how to solve a related problem: what is the required budget to meet a certain margin of error target with confidence 1 \u2212 \u03b1? The answer to this question is to find the C that lowers \u03a6 \u22121 (\u03b1/2) a(v * ; p)/C below the target margin of error, where \u03a6 is the normal cumulative distribution function. 2. Worst-case design. Theorem 1 is a locally optimal design at parameter p, and the optimal design v * may depend on p in general. Whenever we want to highlight this dependence, we will write v * (p). In practice, we often design for a guessed p; for e.g., the Karnataka serosurvey [1] assumed a seroprevalence of 10% prevalence to arrive at the required number of antibody tests. One could also use a prior for p and extend Theorem 1 straightforwardly. Our next result, however, is a design for the worst case, i.e., a design (w t , t \u2208 T ) that minimises",

The minimising player may pick any Nash equilibrium and play his part of the equilibrium, i.e., there is no \"communication problem\" in a two-player zero-sum game. 3. Allocation across strata. Surveys are also conducted across different strata or districts with differing disease burdens. For example, consider D districts, with p(d) being the disease spread parameter in district d, d \u2208 [D] = {1, . . . , D}. If the population fraction of district d is n d , with d\u2208[D] n d = 1, then the weighted overall disease burden in the D districts is d\u2208[D] n d (u Tp (d)) wherep(d) is the MLE for district d when the true parameter is p(d).

Theorem 3 then implies that the budget allocation is in the proportion of the population. Theorem 3 is also applicable to other kinds of stratification, for e.g., sex, age groups, risk categorisation, pre-existing health conditions, etc., so long as the fraction in each component of the stratification under consideration 6 is known. 4. Enabling on-the-ground decisions. Often the surveyors have access to additional information about the participants that might affect the quality of the test outcomes. Let us consider the example of participants presenting with or without symptoms. This is useful information that can inform what tests should be employed. The Karnataka serosurvey found that the RAT is more sensitive on participants with symptoms than on participants without symptoms (68% and 47%, respectively, see [1] ). Let s by the symptom-related observable with s = 0 denoting the absence of symptoms and s = 1 denoting the presence of symptoms. Let r s , s = 0, 1 denote the asymptomatic and the symptomatic fractions of the population. Let p(s) be the model parameter for substratum s, s = 0, 1. The goal is to estimate the total burden s=0,1 r s (u T p(s)). Assuming MLE in each substratum, the objective continues to be the minimisation of the variance of s=0,1 r s (u Tp (s)).",

Suppose that the budget is Rs. 1,00,00,000 = Rs. 1 Crore. Let us fix the RAT and antibody test costs at Rs. 450 and Rs. 300, respectively. In the first row of Table 3 , the RTPCR test costs Rs. 1,600. The optimal allocation is to run antibody tests alone on 521 participants (t = (0, 0, 1)) and the RAT and antibody tests on 13,125 participants (t = (1, 0, 1) ). In particular, no RTPCR tests are done. In the second row of Table 3 , the RTPCR test cost comes down to Rs. 1000. Then the optimal allocation is to run antibody tests (t = (0, 0, 1)) on a larger number of participants, namely 8,000, and the RTPCR and antibody tests on 5,846 participants (t = (0, 1, 1)). In particular, RTPCR is sufficiently competitive that no RAT tests are done. In the third row of Table 3 , the RTPCR test costs only 8 Rs. 100. The optimal allocation is to run exactly one test pattern, the RTPCR and the antibody tests (t = (0, 1, 1)), on 25,000 participants. Our next set of example is with regard to Theorem 2. Consider the numerical example in the fourth row of Table 3 where the RTPCR test cost is only Rs. 100. The range for p 2 comes from the Karnataka's serosurvey [1] where the districts' total burden varied from 8.7% to 45.6%. The ranges for p 1 and p 3 also come from [1] . The worst-case (obtained via a grid search with 0.01 increments) is near p = (0.06, 0.45, 0.0). The optimal design is to spend 2.5% of the budget on antibody tests alone, and 97.5% of the budget on the combination of RTPCR and antibody tests. For the indicated costs, this comes to 838 participants getting only antibody tests and 24,371 participants getting the RTPCR and antibody tests, see the fourth row of Table 3 .",

Additionally, let 10% of the population be symptomatic (r 1 = 0.1). The optimal allocations under Theorem 4 indicate that roughly 91.2% of the budget must be spent on the asymptomatic population and 8.8% on the symptomatic population. The reduction for the symptomatic population is because the estimate is more reliable (given the better sensitivity of the RAT). As expected, the RTPCR test is too expensive and is completely skipped. More interestingly, all asymptomatic participants should be administered the RAT and the antibody tests whereas among the symptomatic participants, a sizable fraction should be administered the antibody test alone. In other words, a smaller fraction of the symptomatic fraction get the RAT. This might be paradoxical at first glance, for one might expect an increased use of RAT on participants where it is more effective. There is however an insightful resolution to this paradox: given that the active infection fraction estimate is likely to be better in the symptomatic population than in the asymptomatic population, we must invest a portion of the budget for the symptomatic population on antibody tests alone to improve the estimation of the fraction with past infection.

Elfving's seminal work [6] shows that, for a linear regression model, the c-optimal design is a convex combination of the extreme points in the design space. Dette and Holland-Letz [5] extended the characterisation of the c-optimal design to nonlinear regression models with unequal noise variances. Our Theorem 1 could be recovered from the results of Dette and Holland-Letz [5] with some additional work to characterise the solution. Chernoff [4] considered the closely related criterion of minimising the trace of ( t\u2208T w t I t (p)) \u22121 and obtained a convex-combinationof-extreme-points characterisation. This criterion is useful in our setting if the surveyor is interested in estimating the individual p 1 , p 2 , and p 3 with good accuracies, not just their sum, and gives equal importance to the three variances. Other design criteria include an optimality criterion that takes into account the probability of observing a desired outcome in generalised linear models [9] , variance minimisation for linear models but with non-Gaussian noise [7] , etc. For us, c-optimality is the most appropriate since our interest is in estimating u T p.",

In principle it should be possible to derive Theorem 2 from that starting point. Our game-theoretic characterisation was more appealing. To the best of our knowledge, Theorem 4 and applications of Theorems 1-4 to COVID-19 survey design are new.

For each p \u2208 P, as argued in the proof of Theorem 1, the mapping v \u2192 a(v; p) is convex on C, and C is a convex and compact subset of the design space. Recall q from (1) and the Fisher information matrix from (2) . The mapping p \u2192 3 s=1 p s q(y|s, t) + (1 \u2212 p 1 \u2212 p 2 \u2212 p 3 )q(y|4, t), \u2200y \u2208 Y t , \u2200t \u2208 T is linear. So by Lemma 5, for each fixed v \u2208 C, the mapping p \u2192 a(v; p) is concave. Also, P is convex and compact. Hence by Glicksberg's fixed point theorem [8] there exists a Nash equilibrium for the game G. The result now follows from Theorem 1 and the interchangeability property of Nash equilibria in two-player zero-sum games (see [12, Theorem 3.1] ). Proof of Theorem 4. The proof is straightforward and follows the same arguments used in the proof of Theorem 3; we only have to use s in place of d and recognise that the Fisher information matrices may depend on s.",

Hence the above problem reduces toNote that (12) By the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions [3, Chapter 5], there exist non-negative numbers (\u03bb * d , d = 1, . . . , D) and \u00b5 * such that the following conditions hold:If \u00b5 * = 0, then (13) is violated for all d; hence \u00b5 * > 0 and by (15), d\u2208[D] m * d = 1. Whenever m * d > 0, we must have \u03bb * d = 0, and by (13), m * d = n d \u00b5 * a(v * (p(d)); p(d)). Using D d=1 m * d = 1, we can solve for \u00b5 * to get.This solves problem (12) . By settingwhere m * d is as given in (16), we also solve problem (11) . By the equivalence of the problems (10) and (11), we have a solution to problem (10), which can be described as follows: Allocate C d = Cm * d to district d, and by Theorem 1, allocate w * t (d) = v * t (p(d))C d /c t for test pattern t in district d. This completes the proof.",
