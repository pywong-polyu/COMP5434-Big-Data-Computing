As a first step, we compare the accuracy of each FUMA student model against the corresponding SVM, RF, and baseline classifiers. To do so we run a set of ANOVAs (one per FUMA model) with classification accuracy as the dependent variable, and classifiers (4 levels) as the factor. After adjustment, all ANOVAs yield a significant main effect of classifiers (p < 0.001, \u03b7 2 from 0.14 to 0.21). Holm-adjusted pairwise comparisons show that FUMA outperforms all other classifiers (p < 0.05, \u03b7 2 > .10) in all cases, including the baseline. Next, we explore FUMA's accuracy across the two different prediction setups (within-and across-MOOC) and the three weeks. Table 4 reports FUMA's accuracy in each of the four MOOCs (i.e., the corresponding holdout set), with the last row showing the accuracy averaged over all holdout sets. We run an ANOVA with classification accuracy as the dependent variable, week (3 levels) and prediction setup (2 levels: within-MOOC and across-MOOC) as the factors. Results show a significant main effect of prediction setup (p < .001, \u03b7 2 = 0.09). A follow-up pairwise comparison among the setups reveals that accuracy for within-MOOC is significantly higher than across-MOOC. This is not surprising given that the within-MOOC setup allows FUMA to learn rules that are fully tailored to a given MOOC, albeit not all of these rules may generalize well. This said, it is noteworthy that even across-MOOC prediction accuracy is much higher than the baseline, and only about 5% below the within-MOOC setup on average. This indicates that FUMA is able to learn a set of rules that can generalize well across our MOOCs, a useful finding since the across-MOOC student model can then be leveraged to drive the delivery of adaptive support regardless of the current MOOC.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 801, "end": 808, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF2"}], "section": "Classification Accuracy of the Online Rule-Based Classifiers"}, {"text": "The lack of main effect of week is also interesting because it means that peak accuracy can be already achieved at week 2, leaving substantial time to provide adaptation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Classification Accuracy of the Online Rule-Based Classifiers"}, {"text": "We report in Table 5 the class accuracy for FUMA at predicting each of the main groups identified in Sect. 5.1, i.e., low, moderate and high learning group.

The fact that high accuracy is obtained for the low group is especially important, as these students are the ones who need help and may benefit from adaptive support. These results provide encouraging evidence for the usefulness of association rule mining for building a student model across MOOCs, which is interesting because association rules are interpretable and thus can be used to guide the design of adaptation support, as discussed next.

Such behavioral recommendations have been successfully applied in previous applications of FUMA to improve students' learning [17, 43] . Table 6 shows these rules grouped as those that generalize across all weeks (first row), rules for week 2 and 3 because they largely overlap (second row), and rules that appear at week 4 only (third raw). As discussed in Sect. 3, FUMA discretizes the features into bins, with the number of bins (6 in our case) being learnt during model training.

The fact that a high coverage of the weekly videos is linked to higher performance makes sense, because each video often introduces new knowledge that can be the target of a quiz. Thus, it is worth experimenting with adaptive support that, in weeks 2-3, recommends longer pauses to students in the lower learning group who tend to go through videos with little pausing, a help strategy that has been shown to be effective with FUMA [17] .
