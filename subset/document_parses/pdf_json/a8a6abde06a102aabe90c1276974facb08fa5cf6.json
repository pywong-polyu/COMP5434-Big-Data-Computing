Patients categorized these symptoms mostly as mild or moderate. A number of studies have also reported these symptoms as the most prevalent ones [3, 4, 6, 7, 13] . Moreover, the prevalence of symptoms in our cohort was also comparable with other cohorts of hospitalized patients [3, 4] . In general, prevalence of symptoms seems to be lower among patients with mild COVID-19 or outpatients [14] . We observed than neuropsychological symptoms tended to persist longer that others such as fatigue or dyspnoea. Previous systematic review and meta-analysis of the outcomes after SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV found that survivors reported symptoms which could persist up to 12-18 months [1] [2] [3] .

            "text": "In general, symptoms reported in our study were more frequent among female and younger patients. There was a statistically significant association between being a woman and the persistent of fatigue or dyspnoea. In agreement with our results, a study that evaluated 100 patients at 48 days post discharge found that fatigue, breathlessness, and neuropsychological disorders were reported more frequently by female patients [6] . Also, a 6-month follow-up after discharge cohort study [4] found that women had an increased risk for anxiety or depression and fatigue. Similarly, another study [15] showed that fatigue, post-activity polypnea, and alopecia were more common in women. We also observed that younger patients presented more risk of arthromyalgia and concentration problems. This association with younger age has been reported also for other symptoms like anosmia-dysgeusia [7] . It is known that the disease severity in the acute phase is associated with pulmonary diffusion and CT pattern abnormalities and increase risk of dyspnoea [4] . Along the same line, our study showed an increased risk of dyspnoea among more severe COVID-19 patients who had required HFO or MV. As in other studies [4] , we could not find an association between the use of immunomodulators or the inflammatory activity during the acute disease and the presence of persistent symptoms. Limitations of our study include the possibility of recall bias as result of the retrospective data collection. Moreover, our study only included patients with moderate to severe disease, and the multivariable logistic regression results may be limited by the small sample size. Finally, the telephone contact was done as a single point of follow-up, so there was not information about how symptoms' severity evolved over time.",

The neuropsychological symptoms lasted longer than fatigue or dyspnoea. This information on symptoms and their duration might help us to better understand the long-term complication of COVID-19. It will also provide a more comprehensive information to our patients, which could reduce their anxiety, and will allow to allocate the available resources more efficiently.
