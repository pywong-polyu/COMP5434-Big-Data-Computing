China has taken the most hit since the outbreak of the virus, which could be dated as far back as late November by some experts. It was not until January 23rd that the Wuhan government finally recognized the severity of the epidemic and took a drastic measure to curtain the virus spread by closing down all transportation connecting the outside world. In this study, we seek to answer a few questions: How did the virus get spread from the epicenter Wuhan city to the rest of the country? To what extent did the measures, such as, city closure and community quarantine, help controlling the situation? More importantly, can we forecast any significant future development of the event had some of the conditions changed? By collecting and visualizing publicly available data, we first show patterns and characteristics of the epidemic development; we then employ a mathematical model of disease transmission dynamics to evaluate the effectiveness of some epidemic control measures, and more importantly, to offer a few tips on preventive measures.",

Such transmission pattern reflects the large population movement prior to the Chinese New Year (January 25), when people usually return home to celebrate a week-long Spring Festival. On January 23, the Wuhan city exercised an extreme wholecity quarantine measure by shutting down all transportations going in and out of the Wuhan city. ",

In this work, the authors used the classic SEIR model, which divides the population into four categories of individuals: susceptible (S), exposed (E),infected (I), and removed (R). The model assumes that individuals transfer between categories with a certain probability. The regenerative number R0 is estimated to be 2.68. From this model, they estimated that the number of infected people in Wuhan had reached about 75,815 by January 25, and a daily infection number to be hundreds of thousands. They estimated several other populous cities (Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Guangzhou) to have somewhat identical trend, except a couple of days shift on the peaking dates. The article basically dismissed the effect of the city-wide quarantine of Wuhan and other aggressive control measures around the country. The forecasting depicted a grave scenario both within China and globally, was helpful in alerting the public, but seemed to be quite off from the reality even at the time of its publishing.",

Like in the article [4] , we assume that the time between two generations of infection, and the time between infection and treatment of 2019-nCoV, are similar to SARS, which are 9 days and 3 days, respectively. That is to say, we can roughly assume that a patient exposed at day t will be infected at day t+6, and be treated at day t+9. Thus, it can be estimated that the total number of patients admitted during t ~ t + 9 is equal to the number of exposed individuals on day t, and the total number of patients admitted during t ~ t + 3 is equal to the number of infected patients on day t. From this, we can estimate E and I of each day, then \u03b2 (t).",

In either case, the curve fits with the actual number of people diagnosed (beige point) in the early stage. It can be seen from the figure that slight deviation on this curve fitting in the early stage may lead to significant departure going forward. Nevertheless, the 'pessimistic' prediction (blue curve) gives a peak date around Feb 10, and the cumulatively confirmed patients number to be 50K on March 1 st , which is quite close to the official numbers publicized.

This unfortunately became the case for the Wuhan city, which was then rescued by pouring medical resources (medical personnel and supplies) from the rest of the country. The city also exercised an extremely aggressive whole-city quarantine on Jan 23, and a reduction of inter-city mobility to almost zero, with the aim of halting any disease transmission. As of today (March 2, 2020),the epidemic in China is well under control. Outside Wuhan has seen zero to single digit daily confirmed infection for a week or so. This is achieved through the aforementioned aggressive quarantine measure across the nation, as described in the report by the WHO-China Joint Mission [6] .",
