This enforced period of isolation, disruption to normal training routines and competition cancellation, could be having an adverse effect on the mental health and wellbeing of athletes. This study sought to explore the perceived impact of the COVID-19 social distancing measures on athlete wellbeing. Fourteen elite athletes who were unable to train or compete due to government imposed lockdown measures were recruited to participate in this qualitative study. Utilising the photo elicitation method, participants were asked to take a series of photographs that represented their experiences as athletes living in lockdown. These photographs were used to guide discussions in follow up unstructured interviews. Reflexive inductive thematic analysis identified three main themes that captured athletes' experience of social distancing measures and the implications for their wellbeing: (1) threats to wellbeing; (2) adapting routines and maintaining motivation; and (3) reflecting on participation in competitive elite sport. The initial sudden loss of sport in the athlete's lives posed a threat to their wellbeing, but over the duration of the lockdown period the athletes developed numerous strategies to protect their wellbeing. Furthermore, their time away from sport encouraged them to reflect on their athletic identity and to make life changes that would protect their wellbeing during the rest of the lockdown period and when they returned to sport. A number of immediate practical recommendations are offered for athlete support personnel working with athletes during the crisis, these include developing self-care strategies and social networks, adapting routines, setting new goals and encouraging the pursuit of dual-careers. Future research is encouraged to investigate how practitioners can deliver effective psychological support through tele-consulting, and to consider whether their support is best focused on therapeutic counselling or mental skills training during the pandemic.",

            "text": "According to the World Health Organisation (World Health Organization, 2004) , mental health is defined as \"a state of well-being in which the individual realises his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community\" (p 1). Whilst mental health is a major resource for athletes in relation to their performance and development in sport, high rates of psychological distress and disturbance are reported among athletes (Markser, 2011) which may impair performance and wellbeing, according to the International Olympic Committee consensus statement on mental health (Reardon et al., 2019) . Research suggests that the prevalence of mental health symptoms and disorders in male elite athletes in team sports (cricket, football, handball, ice hockey and rugby) varies from 5% for burnout and alcohol abuse, to nearly 45% for anxiety and depression (Nixdorf et al., 2013; Gulliver et al., 2014; Beable et al., 2017; Brown et al., 2017; Gouttebarge et al., 2017a,b; Schuring et al., 2017; Drew et al., 2018; Kili\u00e7 et al., 2018) . In female athletes, mental health disorders range from 10% to 25% for depression and eating disorders in particular (Greenleaf et al., 2009; Proctor and Boan-Lenzo, 2010; Brand et al., 2013; Wolanin et al., 2016) . There is also evidence to suggest that occurrence of such mental health disorders amongst elite athletes are associated with higher incidence of severe injuries, surgeries, recent adverse life events, a higher level of career dissatisfaction and a lower level of social support (Gouttebarge et al., 2017b) .",

            "text": "Considering the increasing number of mental health problems being reported in the athletic population, the challenges that the pandemic presents to them, and recent research identifying the adverse effect of social distancing measures on mental health, athletes could be considered an at-risk group during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Indeed, this is reflected in recent findings that show the COVID-19 lockdown period significantly affected athletes' physical and mental health. Specifically, physical deconditioning, worsening nutrition, uncertainty on return to sport, and disruptions to social interaction, training, and sleep patterns (Pillay et al., 2020) were associated with increased depression, anxiety and stress symptoms (Facer-Childs et al., 2021) . Furthermore, in a recent study exploring adversity and resilience in athletes during COVID-19, athletes reported tangible losses with regards to their sport, support networks and athletic identity, and a sense of incongruence as a result of the dissonance between the usual structured, goal directed environment they were accustomed to, and the relatively aimless lockdown scenario presented by COVID-19 (Gupta and McCarthy, 2021) . The incongruence experienced due to the lack of agency during the pandemic, resulted in psychological distress, ruminations, negative emotions and loss of motivation. Whilst the authors acknowledged the role resilience is playing in mobilising coping methods to protect athletes from these adversities, it could not be inferred that the athletes had positively adapted to the stressors as they are still living in a pandemic. Although the overwhelming evidence suggests that athletes have experienced negative physical and psychological effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, \u015een\u0131\u015f\u0131k et al. (2020) reported that the mental health status of athletes was better than non-athletes, attributing this difference to the potential protective effects of physical activity that were still experienced during their pause in sport participation.",

Giles et al. (2020) argued that whilst athletes are by definition sport performers, first and foremost they are people whose physical, mental and social health is reflected through their wellbeing and ill-being. A consideration of athletes' holistic health is fundamental to their identity as performers and people, and their participation in sport can contribute to or detract from their wellbeing. It is argued that the exploration of wellbeing in relation to athletes' experiences of social distancing will provide a broader framework for investigation than mental health alone. Indeed, recent recommendations from a consensus statement on improving the mental health of high-performance athletes (Henriksen et al., 2019) , identified various propositions to inspire researchers and support elite sport organisations to investigate and enhance mental health in athletes. Of particular relevance to the current study was their recommendation to better define mental health in sport as being more than the absence of mental illness, separate from performance, contextualised and acknowledging the full range of human emotions that are experienced.",

            "text": "According to Stambulova et al. (2020) , COVID-19 can be interpreted as a career transition barrier that interferes with athlete development and career progression. In the recent update of The International Society of Sport Psychology Position Stand on Athletes' Career Development and Transitions (Stambulova et al., 2020) , \"career excellence\" is defined as \"an athlete's ability to sustain a healthy, successful, and long-lasting career in sport and life\" and not as \"a destination to reach, but more a journey to, or process of, striving for it, in which athletes might need support\" (p. 14). If we consider COVID-19 as a career development barrier from a holistic developmental perspective (Wylleman, 2019) , it suggests substantial changes to athletes athletic development (e.g., closed sports facilities, postponed and cancelled competitions), psychological health (e.g., threatened athletic identity), psychosocial aspects (e.g., social isolation, worries about significant others), academicvocational responsibilities (e.g., change in focus to education or work), financial concerns (e.g., funding cuts) and changing legal developments (e.g., restrictions on movement). Indeed, Gupta and McCarthy (2021) suggested that if social isolation is conceptualised as an abrupt diversion in an athlete's career, it could trigger dissociations from their athletic identity and negatively impact wellbeing. Athletes often have a strong sense of identity that is derived from their participation in sport (Sparkes, 1998) and when this sporting platform is removed through injury or retirement, they lose access to vital resources and support networks which can result in threats to their wellbeing (Jewett et al., 2019) . Preliminary findings suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns have presented athletes with a similar experience to that of forced retirement (Jewett et al., 2019; Park et al., 2013) and recommendations to support athletes using career transition and/or chronic injury psychological rehabilitation research as an intervention has been advocated (Gupta and McCarthy, 2021) .",

A recent editorial by Schinke et al.

Underpinning these issues was the need to help maintain the health and wellbeing of athletes in their pursuit of performance excellence during this extraordinary time. Schinke et al. (2020) further reflected on their collective work with aspiring Olympic athletes across Asia, Europe and North America and suggested strategies to support athletes that encouraged openness to express their feelings and facilitate problem solving, identification of gaps in their development, and the setting of new goals. Mascret (2020) reported that confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic encouraged athletes to modify their achievement goals; selfapproach goals (improving oneself) and self-avoidance goals (avoiding regression). Specifically, they identified that selfapproach goals decreased, and self-avoidance goals increased, suggesting that during confinement athletes were more focused on avoiding performance decrements than enhancing it.",

The current study utilised the participant-driven (open) format as it was considered most appropriate to address the exploratory nature of the research question. By encouraging the production of participant-driven photographs the researcher can attempt to understand the experiences of the participants (including emotions and ideas) rather than imposing their own framework or preconceived ideas on the topic (Holloway and Galvin, 2017) . The purpose of the images, therefore, is to create a dialogue and to introduce new dimensions that had not been considered by the researcher, and in this respect is easily facilitated by the accompanying unstructured interviews.",

The exclusion criteria were displayed in study invitations. Participants were unable to participate if they: were under the age of 18, had any existing clinical mental health problems, had contracted COVID-19, were recreational athletes, or resided in countries who did not have to adhere to lockdown measures.

Participants were contacted again 2 weeks later to organise an online interview, and to submit via email any photographs they wished to discuss in the interview. All interviews took place between April and May 2020 and were conducted virtually via Microsoft Teams due to the geographical spread of participants across the globe and lockdown regulations in place at the time of data collection.

In order to achieve data familiarity, the researcher first transcribed interviews verbatim using NVivo software and engaged in repeated reading of transcripts and re-listening to the data, helping to move the analysis beyond a focus on the most obvious meanings. In the second stage of the analysis, all data relevant to the research question were coded. This process identified the first patterns in the data by grouping similar data segments at the semantic level. Similar codes were then clustered together to create a visual map of key patterns in the data, these existed in a hierarchical structure containing overarching themes, themes and sub-themes. The themes were reviewed to ensure they fitted with the coded data and the overall data set, and that they each had a clear organising concept. At this stage, the second author reviewed the themes to ensure they were substantially supported by data extracts, and contributed to answering the research question. The final themes and subthemes were then clearly defined and summarised to provide conceptual clarity and a road map for the final report.",

For example, the lead author engaged in regular journaling, reflecting on the process to ensure an in-depth engagement with the data resulting in a meaningful analysis, as recommended by Braun and Clarke (2021) . Furthermore, the lead author carried out the initial coding process which was reviewed by the second author, this process was repeated at the initial theme development stage, as per Braun and Clarke (2021) recommendations for best practise in reflexive thematic analysis. Credibility was ensured by giving participants the opportunity to check transcripts for accuracy, and to engage in a process of member reflections with the lead researcher (Tracy, 2010) to explore any gaps in the results and to share any similarities in the interpretations of the findings (Schinke et al., 2013) . The analysis was also discussed and cross analysed at various stages by the lead researcher's professional doctorate supervisory team to ensure worthy contribution to the topic and meaningful coherence (Tracy, 2010) . As such, we feel that this research is timely and that the findings contribute unique insights regarding athlete wellbeing throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, afforded by our use of the photo elicitation method that is seldom used in sport and exercise literature. Finally, the analytic write up contains data excerpts and analytical commentary to provide strong evidence of patterning across the data (Braun and Clarke, 2013) , which we hope resonates with other members of the elite sporting community also affected by COVID-19 mitigation strategies.",

It has been nice to have it now as a flip from rugby. The thing that lockdown has done is show 100% that you do need these things in place especially as rugby or sports careers are not everlasting at some point you will have to go out and do some sort of other work and with my injury that is something else that showed that.

They shared their feelings of loss, shock and sadness at the cancellation of their sporting events, and spoke of the threat to their physical and mental health as a result of the social isolation during the lockdown. The current research identified athletes' feelings of loneliness from the lack of social interaction with their athletic peers and the negative impact this had on their wellbeing. Tomalski et al. (2019) similarly identified student-athletes as a unique population at a heightened risk for the development of mental health problems, coupled with a decreased willingness to seek help. It has been reported that periods of reduced physical activity compound feelings of isolation from teammates, distance athletes from the athletic community, allow less interaction with coaches and this lack of social support can cause emotional and psychological distress (Reardon et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "The athletes identified numerous barriers to their athletic development and the maintenance of their wellbeing during the lockdown. The lack of access to equipment impacted on their ability to train effectively and the difficulty buying specific foods needed to fuel their recovery slowed down their progress. These stressors were further amplified by the lack of access to their usual coping resources particularly social support. The literature suggests that upon removal of athletes sporting platforms for example through retirement or injury, athletes lose access to vital coping resources such as social support which can threaten their wellbeing (Jewett et al., 2019) . Emerging research suggests that the COVID-19 crisis and lockdowns have caused athletes to experience a similarly, enforced pause in their athletic career to that of forced retirement and chronic injury (Jewett et al., 2019; Gupta and McCarthy, 2021) . Therefore, it has been suggested that career transition support and chronic injury psychological rehabilitation strategies be used to guide interventions with athletes who are struggling to cope with this non-normative transition. Stambulova et al. (2020) suggests that COVID-19 can be interpreted as a \"career transition barrier\" that interferes with athletes' ability to strive towards \"career excellence.\" The present study findings suggest that from a holistic developmental perspective (Wylleman, 2019) , the social distancing measures impacted participants' athletes, psychological, psychosocial, academic-vocational and financial development. Some athletes adapted their training routines to cope with this non-normative transition, whilst others experienced a crisis transition due to lack of resources and ineffective coping strategies. For example, some developed maladaptive behaviours such as disordered eating, sleep disruption, body image disturbance, depression and anxiety. These findings support the recommendation of Stambulova et al. (2020) that athletes need professional support in order to successfully negotiate this transition. Samuel et al. (2020) conceptualised the COVID-19 pandemic as a \"longitudinal, multifaceted, unpredicted, non-controlled change-event, with four distinct stages: (a) a pre-Coronavirus stage with unique career contextual conditions (i.e., stable engagement or a transitional period), (b) Coronavirus stage-A accompanied by instability and confusion, emotional response, and cognitive appraisal, (c) Coronavirus stage-B characterized by active coping or regression, and (d) Coronavirus stage-C; instability endures or decreases, depending on career trajectory.\" (pg1). The present study findings provide empirical evidence to support these proposed stages, as the athletes negotiated this career change-event by implementing changes across a number of the proposed dimensions, and recommend strategies such as setting new goals to help boost motivation, adapting their athletic career aspirations, developing new social networks outside of sport and broadening their self-identity in order to navigate the COVID-19 transition.",

Athletes become well rested if they engage in the resting process which includes sleeping and wakeful resting (Eccles and Kazmier, 2019) . Athletes experience wakeful resting when they do not think about their sport, for example through participating in activities outside of it. The ability to engage in wakeful rest that facilitates a period of \"psychological inactivity\" can be protective for athlete wellbeing (Eccles and Kazmier, 2019) . Indeed, the athletes in the current study reflected on how this enforced hiatus had allowed them to take a much needed rest from the physical and mental stress of competition. Although, for some this was particularly challenging during the first few weeks of lockdown due to the loss of structure and routine in their lives.",

Indeed, the current research suggests that athletes engaged in a reflective practice process during the crisis and this helped them evaluate their situation and employ appropriate coping strategies.

It is paramount that intra and interdisciplinary collaboration between athlete support personnel is encouraged, in order to coordinate efforts to help athletes cope with the current global crisis. For example, case conferencing between multidisciplinary team members and key stake holders to identify athletes with pre-existing mental health problems, injuries or poor social networks who could be at increased risk during periods of social isolation and mobilise appropriate professional support. Sport psychology support should focus on the maintenance of wellbeing and the development of self-care strategies rather than performance gains during this crisis. Athletes are encouraged to adapt their athletic routines to facilitate a positive adjustment to the constraints of social distancing and help protect against the development of maladaptive coping behaviours. Goal setting strategies that focus on a mastery approach that encourages personal development over a performance approach that is focused on outperforming others (Elliot and McGregor, 2001) , should be encouraged in order to boost motivation.",

With the increased accessibility of virtual communication in response to the pandemic, this is an opportune time to capitalise on these new technologies to help enhance athlete wellbeing. In particular, it is worth evaluating the effectiveness of tele-consulting and future research is encouraged to investigate how practitioners can deliver effective psychological support through teleconsulting, and to consider whether their support is best focused on therapeutic counselling or mental skills training during the pandemic. Beyond the COVID-19 pandemic studies could explore how such technologies can be utilised to promote social connectedness during times of normal physical distancing such as injury and breaks between seasons.",

First, the heterogonous sample (Braun and Clarke, 2013) included athletes of different ages and career stages, as well as representing individual and team sports, and from different countries. However, a potential limitation of this heterogeneity is that there may be different cross-cultural conceptions of wellbeing. The majority of the athletes in the study were white so future research must seek to include athletes from other racial backgrounds. Findings reported in this article are unique to this sample and this current pandemic, thus generalization of findings should be avoided, though it would be pertinent to conduct future research that surveys a larger number of athletes. Utilisation of the open photo elicitation method is another strength of this research. Having been previously used in sporting research (e.g., Wakefield and Watt, 2012) , the use of visual imagery in research is thought to evoke memories and facilitate greater immersion and more detailed storytelling by participants, providing rich experiential data (Green and Brock, 2002) . However, the interview process and our interpretations of the athlete's stories could have been influenced by the authors experience and knowledge as a sport psychologist, although the participants were invited to verify the findings in order to decrease the risk of misinterpretation (Karnieli-Miller et al., 2009 ).",
