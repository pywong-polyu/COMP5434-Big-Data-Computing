They may be in their final year at school, starting or completing tertiary education, and are also more likely to be in precarious employment [11] [12] [13] , so they are at a greater risk of job losses under economic crises like pandemics [14] . Young adults each experience these transitions along different pathways and timelines [15] , meaning their social supports and economic circumstances are diverse and fluctuating. For some, this is a time when financial autonomy is established, while for others study or economic insecurity can increase dependence on parental support [16] . Indeed, where pandemicrelated research has focused on young adults exclusively, or results have been stratified by age in population-wide surveys, young adults are shown to have experienced higher levels of psychological distress than other age groups during the pandemic, both internationally [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] and in Australia [14, [22] [23] [24] .",

These risk and protective factors reflect the daily activities and resources typically available or relevant to young people, but have yet to be fully explored in relation to young adults. In general, unemployment, job loss, and financial stress have consistently shown associations with poorer mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic [2, 5, 14, 22, 23, 25] , but less is known about the influence of job precarity, which, as described earlier, disproportionately affects young people. With more time being spent at home, increased screen time during COVID-19 lockdowns has been reported consistently [19, 25, 26] . In some studies, this has been associated with poorer mental health [17, [27] [28] [29] , with explanations centering around excessive exposure to news cycles, blurred work-life balance as a result of working-from-home, or passive media use leading to lower social support seeking [2, 19, 26, 30] . In other cases, screen time has been linked with better mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic and labelled as a positive coping mechanism which helps individuals stay connected with their communities and social networks [18, 26] . Only two of these studies explored the impact of increased screen time among young people specifically [17, 18] , but both were limited to samples of American college students.",

However, mental health does not exist on one continuum with mental illness and mental well-being (absence of mental illness) sitting at opposite ends of the same spectrum. Rather, as the dual-continua model of mental health suggests, mental illness and mental well-being exist on two distinct continua [44, 45] and changes in levels of mental well-being are a predictor of future risk of mental illness (e.g., losses of mental well-being predict increases in mental illness, while gains in mental well-being predict declines in mental illness) [46] . Failure to consider this complexity in mental health may mean that adverse consequences for mental well-being, that undermine quality of life without rendering a person mentally ill at the time, are overlooked. As such, there is a need to assess the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic from a more holistic point-of-view and consider both symptoms of mental illness and symptoms of well-being in conceptualizations of mental health [47] . The Complete State Model of Mental Health provides a more comprehensive perspective of mental health, as it categorizes individuals into four states of mental health: Flourishing (no-to-low mental illness, with high levels of mental well-being), Languishing (no-to-low mental illness, with low levels of mental well-being), Struggling (moderate-to-high mental illness, with high levels of mental wellbeing), or Floundering (moderate-to-high mental illness, with low levels of mental wellbeing) [47, 48] .",

The sample was limited to young Australians living in metropolitan areas because impacts of the pandemic, as well as risk and protective factors, are likely to differ considerably for young people living in rural areas. Quota sampling was used in an attempt to capture a sample which covered a spectrum of parameters balanced by gender, state/territory, and socioeconomic status. An area-level indicator of participants' socioeconomic status (SES), based on residential postcode, was assigned using the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Socio-Economic Indexes for Areas Index of Relative Advantage and Disadvantage [59] . The ABS scores and ranks geographic areas in Australia on indicators of socioeconomic advantage and disadvantage, based on information gathered in a 5-yearly census. For the purposes of this study, participants were split into quintiles based on these area-level scores (1 = most disadvantaged, 5 = most advantaged).",

In the early stages of the pandemic, Australia worked towards reducing the incidence of COVID-19 and \"flattening the curve\". In doing so, from March 2020 most states and territories in Australia introduced border restrictions which limited travel across the country, temporary closure of non-essential activities, gatherings and businesses, and people were encouraged to work from home and only go out when essential. Between May and June of 2020, restrictions began to ease across Australia and non-essential services were permitted to operate under new conditions. In late June 2020, stay at home restrictions were reintroduced in the state of Victoria, following a second wave of COVID-19. These restrictions were lifted almost 5 months later in late November 2020, during the study period. Just as this occurred, a cluster outbreak occurred in South Australia which resulted in a 3-day hard lockdown and the closure of several state and territory borders during the study period. A cluster in Northern Sydney (New South Wales) then occurred in December 2020, which resulted in a stay at home order for those areas, new restrictions on social gatherings and non-essential services, and border closures over the week of Christmas. Relative to other countries, Australia has had very few deaths and limited community transmission of COVID-19.",

As shown in Figure 3 and Table 3 , compared to young people with no-to-low financial stress, those who reported moderate financial stress were over 1.5 times more likely to be Languishing, 2 times more likely to be Struggling, and greater than 5 times more likely to be Floundering. Participants who reported experiencing high-to-overwhelming financial stress were over 7 times more likely to be Struggling and had 15 times the risk of Floundering.",

A small proportion of this sample were considered Flourishing (14%), with high levels of mental well-being and low-to-mild levels of mental illness symptoms. The largest group in the sample (47.5%) were classified as Struggling, meaning they tended to have moderate-to-high levels of mental well-being, while also experiencing moderate-to-severe psychological distress. This is consistent with most international [17] [18] [19] [20] and Australian [14, [22] [23] [24] literature, which indicates that young adults have experienced high levels of psychological distress during the pandemic. A smaller, yet sizeable proportion of the sample (25.5%), were found to be Languishing, meaning they reported no-to-mild levels of psychological distress, but they also reported low levels of mental well-being. Given levels of mental well-being have been found to predict future levels of mental illness [46] , this may have implications for the mental health of this sub-group beyond the pandemic. Overall, the mental health profiles obtained in the current study suggest that young adults should be a target group for both provision of mental health services and preventive strategies in the immediate post-pandemic context.",

Foremost, advocating for job security is important for promoting mental well-being and preventing mental illness for young adults [69] . While other research has highlighted the mental health impacts of unemployment and job loss during the COVID-19 pandemic [14, 25] , our study extends this literature and demonstrates the mental health risks of precarious employment. Young people in our sample who had secure employment (e.g., permanent positions) had the best mental health (i.e., Flourishing). By comparison, those in less secure employment (e.g., casual workers) with fewer benefits like sick leave or paid time off for quarantine purposes, had poorer mental health (i.e., Languishing, Struggling, and Floundering). This is concerning for young people globally because they are more likely to be in precarious employment [12, 13] .",

Young Australians in our sample who reported an increase in their income as a result of the pandemic were still 2 times more likely to be classified as Struggling than respondents who experienced no change in income. This is similar to those who reported reduced income due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and suggests that instability and changes out of one's control may be a greater source of distress than currently recognised. Related to this, instability during the pandemic appeared to be associated with worst mental health for young people who were living independently and did not have the social supports or \"buffers\" available to those living with their parent(s) or partner.",

While excessive screen time has repeatedly been linked with poorer psychological outcomes in a pre-COVID world [65] , a number of recent studies have found screen time to be a useful resource for adaptive coping during lockdowns, through positive escapism or community engagement, for example [18, 26] . Young Australians in our sample tended to increase their screen time overall during lockdowns/restrictions, but those who decreased their screen time were significantly more likely to be Struggling with their mental health. When asked about their experiences of using screen time during COVID-19 lockdowns/restrictions, those who had the best mental health in our sample (i.e., Flourishing) appeared to view screen time as a useful resource which helped them cope during the pandemic and connect with family and friends (even when accounting for screen time fatigue). Contrastingly, young people who disagreed that screen time helped them cope during the pandemic were over 2.5 times more likely to have the worst mental health (i.e., Floundering) and appeared to experience screen time fatigue and difficulty engaging with technology-mediated communications during lockdowns/restrictions. Exposure to news stories in the media did not seem to independently affect mental health. In the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be that higher levels of screen time reflect greater engagement and connection which supports mental health, while decreases in screen time indicate a group who may have become withdrawn. If this pattern of low engagement and withdrawal is generalizable, this would have important implications for public health messaging and community-based mental health services, which typically assume that people who are struggling can be reached via social media and media mental health campaigns.",

            "text": "Consistent with a growing body of other research, our results suggest that investment in green infrastructure is important for supporting young people's mental health \"in place\" during lockdowns [33, 70] . A UK-based study reported that not having access to a private outdoor space during the pandemic was associated with greater psychological distress [20] , while other studies have highlighted the mental health benefits offered by domestic gardens for both young and older individuals during lockdowns [35, 37, 71] . Similarly, in our study, not having access to a residential outdoor space during the pandemic was associated with a 5-fold risk of worst mental health (i.e., Floundering) among young Australians. In contrast to residential outdoor space, not having a public green or bluespace within walking distance of the home was associated with a greater risk of Languishing only, suggesting that this type of green amenity may be particularly pertinent to promoting mental wellbeing. Across a number of studies, general neighbourhood greenery has also been linked with reduced psychological distress [37, 39] and greater positive emotions [36, 38, 39] during the COVID-19 pandemic. Consistent with this, the degree of neighbourhood naturalness was associated with mental health state in our sample, particularly at either extreme, with young Australians living in highly green/natural environments more likely to have the best mental health (i.e., Flourishing) and those living in highly built neighbourhoods more likely have the worst mental health (i.e., Floundering).",

Together, these findings highlight the potential mental health implications of high-density living, and emphasise social justice implications of inequitable access to urban greenspaces, especially under extenuating circumstances like pandemics.",

In our study and others [42, 76] , hope has shown to be a powerful protective factor for mental health during the pandemic. This is an important public health finding and suggests that populationlevel mental health interventions should move beyond encouragement of self-care towards actively fostering hope in young people through evidence-based approaches [77] .",

First, it is not possible to generate a random sample of young adults for an online survey directly from electronic contact details, due to the lack of a sampling frame. While the electoral roll is a reliable sampling frame, this approach requires posting information to participants which is not the best avenue to engage young people [78] . As such, a convenience sample was used. This approach is acceptable since our aim was to not to make prevalence estimates [79] , but rather to explore inter-relationships between key variables. Quota sampling meant that the final sample had strengths in terms of size and diversity. It seems unlikely that the associations reported would be different among young people who did not participate. Research about social and mental health surveys indicates that individuals with severe mental illness are less likely to participate in online surveys than those without such conditions [79] , nevertheless, some do so, and that was the case in our study.",

Likewise, causation cannot be claimed and there is likely bi-directionality. Furthermore, the changing context of the COVID-19 pandemic (including cluster outbreaks and snap-lockdowns), and the study period taking place over a holiday period (Christmas and the New Year) may have affected participants' mental health at the time of response. However, the latter may have had less influence, given the majority of data (98% of responses) were obtained before Christmas. Overall, longitudinal studies are required to investigate the potential direction of causation and to determine the long-term psychological effects of the pandemic.",

Finally, while the results in our study mirror mental health experiences of young adults in similar high-income countries, it is important to note that our findings may not completely generalise to other contexts because COVID-19 infection rates during the study period were significantly lower in Australia than in other high-income countries such as the USA and UK [80] . Given that Australia has been one of the countries least affected by COVID-19 in terms of morbidity and mortality [80] , this makes the psychological impacts on young people all the more notable.",

Moving forward, young adults not only require focused funding for mental health services to deal with the current burden, but should also be supported through a range of preventive strategies which target mental health risk factors and enhance protective factors. This will involve not only individual-level intervention, but also support for significant structural changes around the way young people work, the environments in which they live, and the way they are able to participate in society more widely.",
