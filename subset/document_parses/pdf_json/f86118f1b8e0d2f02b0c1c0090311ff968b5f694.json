Duration of the disease was between 2 and 12 weeks. Frequencies of handwashing during the COVID-19 pandemic ranged between 15 and 25 times daily. Patients reported that their handwashing frequencies had increased 5 to 6-fold compared to before the pandemic (Table 1) . Frequent disinfectant use was also present. Irritant contact dermatitis on the dorsum of the hand was observed in four cases. The patients had no histories of drug use, atopic dermatitis, or cystic fibrosis, and no similar disease was present in their family histories. Dermatological examination revealed symmetrical whitish, keratodermic, macerated plaques containing dilated spaces on the palms and fingertips following brief contact with water ( Figure 1A -C). The symptoms appeared 1 to 5 min after exposure to water and resolved 3 to 60 min after the end of contact with water.",

The lesions may be accompanied by itching, tingling, burning sensations, and sometimes pain. 6 It may sometimes be seen on the dorsum of the fingers. Unilateral cases have also been reported. 5, 6 It often goes unrecognized, especially because symptoms rapidly resolve with drying of the skin and are often transient during lifetime and different seasonal periods. However, the lesions are reproducible by immersing the patient's hands into warm or cold water for a few minutes (\"hands in the bucket\" sign). The lesions persist for from 10 min to 1 h, but may last for up to 2 h in some cases. 6 The lesions become more pronounced after contact with water.

AK is most frequently comorbid with cystic fibrosis (CF), and estimated that between 44% and 80% of patients with CF have AK. 5,6 CF emerges as a result of mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR) gene on the long arm of the seventh chromosome that encodes the protein CFTR. The CFTR gene is responsible for the cAMP-activated transmembrane Na and Cl channels. Cl release decreases while Na absorption increases in epithelial cells with structural and functional impairment in CFTR in CF. 9 Epidermal sodium uptake on the volar surfaces of the hands and feed in CF patients is thought to be capable of causing AK by leading to increased water absorption. Hyperhidrosis, and the use of aspirin and similar COX-II inhibitors (celecoxib and rofecoxib) are thought to result in water absorption in association with increased sodium retention, as in CF. 5 There is no effective therapeutic option in AK. The most commonly recommended option in the literature is topical application of aluminum salts. Other effective and applied options include antihistaminics, botulinum toxin, and 5% salicylic acid and urea. 1, 5, 6 I recommended urea-containing moisturizers for our patients, together with a one-third reduction in handwashing frequencies. A 60% to 70% decrease in lesions was observed at 1-month controls.",
