            "text": "Pathogens have evolved a variety of life-history strategies. An important strategy consists of successful transmission by an infected host before the appearance of symptoms, that is, while the host is still partially or fully asymptomatic. During this initial stage of infection, it is possible for another pathogen to superinfect an already infected host and replace the previously infecting pathogen. Here, we study the effect of superinfection during the first stage of an infection on the evolutionary dynamics of the degree to which the host is asymptomatic (host latency) in that same stage. We find that superinfection can lead to major differences in evolutionary behaviour. Most strikingly, the duration of immunity following infection can significantly influence pathogen evolutionary dynamics, whereas without superinfection the outcomes are independent of host immunity. For example, changes in host immunity can drive evolutionary transitions from a fully symptomatic to a fully asymptomatic first infection stage. Additionally, if superinfection relative to susceptible infection is strong enough, evolution can lead to a unique strategy of latency that corresponds to a local fitness minimum, and is therefore invasible by nearby mutants. Thus, this strategy is a branching point, and can lead to coexistence of pathogens with different latencies. Furthermore, in this new framework with superinfection, we",

To limit this burden and successfully decrease disease transmission, it is important to quantify epidemiological dynamics (e.g. [1] [2] [3] ). Numerous factors influence transmission and are thus important to consider in epidemiological models. For example, the ability of a pathogen to transmit while a host remains without symptoms has often been highlighted in the epidemiological literature as an important characteristic (e.g. [4] [5] [6] ). In particular, if hosts are able to transmit an infection while initially remaining asymptomatic, or 'fully latent', and thereby escaping detection, control measures become substantially more difficult [5] . Therefore, understanding the dynamics of a sub-symptomatic or fully asymptomatic first infection stage is imperative for disease control. The importance of transmission without symptoms is strikingly illustrated by the recent COVID-19 pandemic [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

            "text": "The evolutionary dynamics of a pathogen play a central role in host epidemiology. Evolving pathogens are under a series of constraints, including those imposed by within-host replication and host immunity. These constraints can modulate the degree of latency, i.e. the spectrum from fully symptomatic to fully asymptomatic, in the initial infectious stage. Here, we consider the initial infectious stage to be one where transmission may occur; this stage is distinct from and may follow a stage after infection where hosts are infected but not infectious. In other words, we consider a two-stage infection process where the first stage is said to have 'zero latency' if this stage is fully symptomatic, whereas we say the first stage has 'maximal latency' if it is fully asymptomatic. Thus, latency is a measure of the degree to which a host in the initial infectious stage fails to exhibit symptoms. If a host is more latent in the first stage (i.e. more asymptomatic), then the pathogen can potentially remain in this stage longer due to lowered host immune responses that would lead to pathogen clearance. However, in order for the pathogen to successfully 'hide' from the host immune system, decreased within-host replication and thus decreased pathogen shedding is required, which in turn decreases transmission (see [12] for a detailed discussion and further references). Therefore, there can exist a trade-off between transmission and progression in the first stage of an infection.",

Historically, there has been strong interest in understanding pathogen virulence from an evolutionary perspective (e.g. [2, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] ). With regard to latency, Saad-Roy et al. [12] coupled a simple epidemiological model with two infection stages to a life-history approach to study the evolutionary outcomes of latency (\u03bb) on the initial infection stage. These authors examined simple forms of progression and transmission trade-offs, and found four possible evolutionary behaviours: a unique evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) at zero latency, positive latency, maximal latency or bistability with zero and maximal latency. With more complicated trade-off forms that changed concavity of progression and transmission as functions of latency, these authors also observed the appearance of multiple interior evolutionarily singular strategies. Throughout their analyses, Saad-Roy et al. [12] assumed that a pathogen could not infect a host currently infected with, or with immunity to, another strain of the pathogen.",

Nowak & May [29] showed the possibility of coexistence of pathogens with different virulences. Furthermore, as a function of virulence difference between invader and resident, Gandon et al. [27] revealed that a fitness minimum (for the pathogen) can exist if the increase in superinfection propensity is rapid enough. In addition, Gandon et al. [28] examined the coevolution of pathogen virulence and host resistance in a framework that includes superinfection.

In particular, characterizing the possible evolutionary outcomes of latency for different regimes of superinfection could highlight the degree of latency that could arise from the various evolutionary scenarios. In turn, parameter regions where a fully asymptomatic first stage of infection is evolutionarily stable could be identified. Lastly, determining the importance of host immunity duration following recovery and the interplay with superinfection would emphasize the relative effects that host immunity can have on the evolutionary dynamics of latency. We focus on obligate single host, directly transmitted pathogens, such as measles, smallpox, norovirus, HIV, herpes simplex virus, etc. (See [12] for a detailed discussion of the ties between our underlying model, latency and viruses that infect humans.)",

Under these assumptions, we study life-history strategies of pathogens in terms of latency during an initial infection stage, as defined in [12] . We show that the inclusion of superinfection qualitatively and quantitatively affects the evolutionary dynamics of latency. In particular, we highlight how the interplay of host immunity and superinfection can modulate pathogen evolutionary outcomes. We also find that superinfection mediates the existence of a unique branching point, i.e. an evolutionary attractor that does not maximize fitness but instead is a local fitness minimum and is therefore evolutionarily unstable. Thus, this branching point can lead to the mutual invasibility of strains with different latencies, in particular what numerically appears to be an evolutionarily stable coalition of strains at zero and maximal (fully asymptomatic) latency. However, when there is mutual invasibility, it remains an open problem to show whether the result is always stable coexistence. We also illustrate other novel evolutionary behaviours that emerge due to superinfection.",

Thus, these results enable us to use the adaptive dynamics approach on this system. Otherwise, if the basic reproduction number is less than one, the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable [12] ; in other words, the disease dies out.

From the pairwise invasibility plot (PIP), it is clear that this singular strategy is an attractor, but allows nearby mutants to invade. Thus, if initial latency is above or below the branching point, mutations intermediate to the initial strategy lead to invasion. As evolution progresses, the resident pathogen continues to approach the singular strategy. However, as the singular strategy is reached, mutants with smaller or larger latencies can invade, giving rise to branching and mutual invasibility.

Furthermore, for the example in figure 3 , we numerically find that a coalition with types at zero and infinite latency is evolutionarily stable. The mutual invasibility of two different types of latencies has interesting analogies with the competitive-exclusion principle [40, 50] , and similar observations have been made for coexistence with superinfection in a model with one infection stage [37] . Indeed, with no superinfection, the only 'resource' for the pathogen is the susceptible population, and mutual invasibility between types is not possible. However, with superinfection, our model can be interpreted as having two 'resources' for pathogens: the susceptible population, and the population that is in the first infection stage.",

Analogous to that scenario, we have proved that with superinfection there can be a unique interior singular strategy under certain conditions, with the caveat that this singular strategy could be convergence stable and not evolutionarily stable.

This strategy is convergence semistable: for initial latency above this singular strategy, mutants with values of latency progressively further away from the singular strategy can invade, whereas for initial latencies below the singular strategy, mutants with values intermediate to the singular strategy can invade. Thus, this singular strategy is approached in evolutionary time only from below. When it is reached, then it is susceptible to invasion by mutants with larger latency.

This is particularly the case when transmission decays faster than progression in the first stage. Indeed, we proved that in this regime, then any evolutionarily singular strategy is not an ESS, and we further showed that there can exist an ESS at zero latency, a singular strategy ( possibly unique) that is a repeller and so leads to bistability at zero and maximal latency. We also showed that there can exist a unique convergence-stable singular strategy that is not an ESS, and is therefore a branching point. If progression decays faster than transmission, then any singular strategy is an ESS, and we showed that there can either be an ESS at zero latency, or an interior CSS, leading to a sub-symptomatic first infectious stage. Through numerical simulations, we have also illustrated that two interior evolutionarily singular strategies can exist with superinfection, posing a stark contrast to the case without superinfection. It is also worth noting that our 'latent' stage is distinct from a short stage after infection before a host is infectious and without symptoms, though we explore a generalization of this scenario in electronic supplementary material, The addition of infection stages. Furthermore, in a situation where hosts with no symptoms cannot transmit, i.e. \u03b1 1,\u221e = 0, then \u03bb = \u221e is never an ESS. Intuitively, a completely presymptomatic stage during which pathogens are not transmissive does not evolutionarily emerge, nor does the branching point (irrespective of the strength of superinfection).

Most interestingly, we have shown that superinfection can enable the duration of host immunity to influence critically the evolutionary outcomes of latency. For example, superinfection can lead to different evolutionary possibilities if immunity is lifelong or if hosts have no immunity following recovery. By contrast, without superinfection, the SIIRS, SIIR and SIIS frameworks all give rise to identical evolutionary dynamics. This notable distinction is powerful: under superinfection, for the same shapes of trade-offs, the possible outcomes for latency evolution can be set by the duration of host immunity. Furthermore, significant qualitative and quantitative changes of evolutionary dynamics can cascade from a small change in the duration of immunity. For certain viral diseases in humans, such as influenza or coronaviruses, it is thus imperative to determine the propensity for superinfection by closely related strains, in addition to the shape of the underlying trade-off between transmission and progression.

In particular, a larger superinfection parameter decreases the parameter space for which there is an ESS at maximal latency (whether local or unique). However, a larger superinfection parameter also implies that a unique branching point can exist. Furthermore, it appears (numerically) that a coalition of zero and maximal latency can be evolutionarily stable. While this coalition outcome does not represent a local ESS at maximal latency, it nevertheless suggests that it may be possible for a fully latent pathogen to emerge evolutionarily even when there is high superinfection. In addition, the inclusion of superinfection in our modelling framework can also lead to multiple interior evolutionarily singular strategies.",

In order to gain pathogen-specific insight into the evolution of latency, it is therefore necessary to characterize the relative propensity of superinfection relative to susceptible infection. Then, initiatives such as the isolation of infectious individuals can be regarded with an evolutionary lens. Indeed, knowledge of the evolutionary outcomes could clarify if it is sufficient to isolate all infectious individuals together (and hence possibly enable superinfection), or if care should be taken to properly isolate individual cases (to reduce the probability of superinfection). The economic costs of these alternative measures can differ substantially, and more costly initiatives would probably only be enacted if there existed clear benefits. Thus, these questions are of significant public health interest, and they have implications for the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

Indeed, the evolutionary dynamics of latency are qualitatively identical for an additional stage after the second infection stage, which can superinfect but cannot be superinfected, or an initial stage prior to the first stage, which cannot superinfect nor be superinfected (electronic supplementary material, The addition of infection stages). For example, numerous diseases exhibit a short period after infection before transmission starts.",

For HIV, transmission during the latent stage is important, as has been underlined in numerous studies [5, 54, 55] . Here, we find a mechanism that could explain the emergence of viruses that exhibit different latencies. Indeed, if superinfection in the latent stage of HIV can occur, then the probability of superinfection is enhanced since this stage can last many years. Further, the likelihood of superinfection is also especially increased since these individuals could still engage in risky behaviour, which could heighten their exposure to a virus with another phenotype. Extensions of our evolutionary-epidemiological model to consider co-infections could elucidate the connection between HIV co-infections and the coexistence of strains with different latencies.",

However, it is possible that superinfection in the symptomatic stage could occur with a different propensity compared to that in the first infection stage, and this would also be a logical direction to explore. Investigating the addition of further infection stages with different propensities of superinfection would also be an immediate extension.

One potential approach would be to perform similar latency evolutionary analyses with superinfection within the epidemiological model framework presented by Morris et al. [56] (see also [57] ) with a secondary susceptible class for those individuals that were previously infected but whose immunity has waned. More broad natural future directions would be to investigate host-pathogen coevolutionary dynamics between pathogen latency and host immunity, or to examine the effect of individual heterogeneity in host immunity on the evolutionary dynamics of latency. Furthermore, we have focused on pathogens that infect a single host and are directly transmitted. However, to study the emergence of a presymptomatic infectious stage for other diseases caused by opportunist pathogens, our model would require the inclusion of other important factors, such as multiple hosts species and the surrounding environment (including other pathogens) [58] .",
