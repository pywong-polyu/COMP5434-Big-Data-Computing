            "text": "Scientists increasingly cross their disciplinary boundaries and connect with local stakeholders to jointly solve complex problems. Working with stakeholders means higher legitimacy and supports practical impact of research. Games provide a tool to achieve such transdisciplinary collaboration. In this paper, we explore the use of a game in a participatory project where scientists and local stakeholders are seeking and defining a joint problem. The literature is clear that this step is essential but remains short on concrete methods. Here, we explore this potential in practice. We conducted parallel participatory processes in two alpine regions considered as socio-ecological system (SES) in Switzerland and France, both vulnerable to global change. Based on these two case studies, we co-constructed a game, integrating scientific concerns about key land use, climate change and socio-economic elements of a mountain SES (tourism, agriculture, housing and demography). With the game, we assessed the existence of joint problems connecting scientific and local interests. The game successfully engaged participants at both sites over 11 game sessions, showing potential of use in other transdisciplinary settings. By covering a wide array of issues, the game created a discussion space for listing problems and identifying where scientist and stakeholder interests overlap. In Switzerland, the game revealed no pressing joint problem to be addressed. In France, game sessions revealed, among other problems, an enduring and complex issue regarding the co-existence of inhabitants and powerful institutions. Having demonstrated the capacity of this game for joint-problem assessment, we believe other participatory research in similar SES could benefit from an early use of such an approach to frame the potential for collaboration.",

Games are particularly relevant to deal with uncertainty and a plurality of actor perspectives (Klabbers 1996) . They have been used in education (Garcia et al. 2016; Wouters et al. 2009 ), natural resource management (Etienne 2013) , urban planning (Poplin 2011) , climate adaptation (Flood et al. 2018) and many other fields. The use of games may trigger efficient learning among a diversity of end-users, from students to stakeholders facing \"real-life\" issues. In science, games have been successfully used to tackle complex problems by engaging with gamers, like molecule folding (Cooper et al. 2010; Lee et al. 2014) . Games can be used as a boundary object (Star and Griesemer 1989) to facilitate the discussion among a diversity of stakeholders and thus eventually enhance negotiation, coordination, cooperation or concertation (Etienne 2013) .",

Participation in this context may facilitate the integration of diverse perspectives, knowledge and issues into the modelled reality, thus improving the design and relevance of such models (Smetschka and Gaube 2020) . It may also enhance the legitimacy of the game itself by ensuring an early connection to potential end-users. Additionally, participation in the game development appears to enhance the capacities of participants by expanding their understanding of the issue at stake, in particular by getting to know other stakeholders' perspectives in more detail (Mathevet et al. 2011) . In general, in democratic societies, such approaches may enhance the dialogue about debated and complex issues and lead to better decision-making, especially when stakes and uncertainties are high (Funtowicz and Ravetz 1994) . In non-democratic societies, it may help to give voice to minorities and try to include them in decisions made by others but that impact them (Barnaud et al. 2010) .",

            "text": "In this paper, we look more specifically into the participatory process of establishing a joint problem. We define a problem as Pearce and Ejderyan (2020) in the sense that a problem exists when a current state differs from a desired state. The foremost importance of establishing a joint problem for participatory research-when stakeholders and scientists jointly frame the problem at stake-has been repeatedly stated (Hirsch-Hadorn et al. 2008; Jahn et al. 2012; Norstr\u00f6m et al. 2020; Steger et al. 2021) . In practice, this process is rarely documented (Etienne, 2013) as framing the problem itself is mentioned as an important step but the description of real processes are missing (Pearce and Ejderyan 2020) . Some rare papers detail the process but the authors themselves mention that the process remains a \"consulting rather than participatory\" one (Sch\u00e4fer and Kr\u00f6ger 2016) . In practice, most of these research processes are more often initiated by external institutions that are not local stakeholders (research institutions, NGOs, international organizations, states and other public institutions) (Voinov and Bousquet 2010) . In particular, the share of power over the framing of the research is critical (Fritz and Meinherz 2020) . In that sense, we can distinguish three types of arenas where problems can be framed (Fig. 1) . First, cases where the problem is framed by political authorities and thus researchers accompany a political change (Bourgoin and Castella 2011) ; second, when researchers themselves have the control to make the problem fit with their conceptual or methodological objectives (Houet et al. 2017; Sun and M\u00fcller 2013) ; finally, a third type of case when problems emerge along with participatory processes regarding concrete and local problems, whether at the initial stage of the research (Reed et al. 2013) or through iterative modelling loops (Barnaud et al. 2007; Anselme et al. 2010; Luthe 2017) .",

To overcome this issue, the challenge is to know how to connect an externally constructed problem with local problems. While the process of structuring a problem in a participatory fashion-once it has been set-has been explored for many years Rosenhead and Mingers, 2001; Shaw et al. 2006) , methods to jointly frame the problem itself have not been described much in the literature. Even in very integrative participatory processes where scientists, project initiators and local stakeholders are well connected, the coconstruction of a joint problem remains mostly undescribed (Campo et al. 2010; Gaddis et al. 2010) . This suggests that project initiators usually hold the power over the decision about how to frame the problem at the beginning. Even though some power asymmetries can be overcome during the process (Barnaud et al. 2010) , the importance of setting the initial problem remains significant (Etienne 2013; Grimm and Railsback 2005) and probably conditions the Fig. 1 Diversity of contexts where a research problem can be established in participatory research overall direction of the research process towards the initiator's interests rather than those of local stakeholders.",

Such a situation can arise when different parties hold different worldviews. For example, despite a wide consensus among scientists about threats from climate change there are enduring uncertainties, and citizens may remain sceptical about their significance (Whitmarsh 2011) , probably as values and political allegiances often overshadow facts about the topic (Hornsey et al. 2016; Milfont et al. 2021) . Prioritization on this specific matter has already led to intense controversies (Lomborg 2003; Pielke Jr 2004) . The difficulty to co-construct a common problem can also come from psychological distance, when a decision needs to be made now for a distant future impact (Liberman and Trope 1998; McDonald et al. 2015) . Moreover, even local stakeholders may hold very diverse mental models about a similar SES (Mathevet et al. 2011 ) and challenge the possibility to come to an agreement on the most important matter locally. Even though such ambiguity (or social uncertainty) between stakeholders can be handled or even elicited (Brugnach et al. 2011; Salliou et al. 2017) , uncertainties in general are thought to hinder decision-making. It has been shown, for example, that the decision to act collectively to avoid a climate change tipping point was significantly reduced by uncertainties about the threshold temperature triggering it (Barrett and Dannenberg 2013) . Finally, it may simply be the case that there is no complex joint problem to tackle requiring a participatory approach. Indeed, not all joint problems might require a participatory process. According to the post-normal framework from Funtowicz and Ravetz (1994) , participatory approaches are relevant when relying on experts and normal science is not sufficient to solve a problem. This happens when uncertainties and stakes are high. However, it is not always clear when a given system is in such a situation.",

We did so in a research project where our main research question related to adaptation pathways (Wise et al. 2014) in the context of global change in mountain socioecological systems (SES). In particular, we were interested in the capacities of local communities to mobilize ecosystem services for their climate change adaptation . SES are defined by the complex interactions between humans, their institutions and ecosystems (Ostrom 2009 ). This project was conducted in parallel at two sites, in the Southern French Alps and in the Swiss upper Valais. Mountains are particularly interesting for climate and adaptation scientists, because the impact of climate change is particularly strong, e.g. melting glaciers, snow reduction challenging tourism activities and rising natural risks like avalanches and landslides (Klein et al. 2019) . With our research questions framing the initial problem and together with local stakeholders, we co-designed a board game called \"GAME OF CRUXES\" (a crux is a difficult section in a climbing or mountaineering route). Through visioning workshops with local stakeholders and conceptualization with relevant local and scientific experts, we created a board game including local understanding of important dynamics of these mountain SES. In this paper, we analyse whether this type of game and inclusive co-design enabled stakeholders and scientists to identify potential joint problems for participatory research.",

This approach has been used successfully to create many serious games over the years.

In this approach, the game is usually a means to an end: the discussion and learning triggered by the interactions of players during the game session and particularly in the post-game debriefing session. In this paper, we mobilize three key steps from the companion modelling approach to design our game: (1) establishing a common conceptualization of the SES system at stake with key stakeholders, (2) translating main concepts and interactions from the previous step into game mechanics, (3) facilitating and observing game sessions involving a diversity of stakeholders together with a post-game debriefing to reflect on the experiential learning.",

This method leads to the production of a normative targeted future with participating stakeholders. Diversity of participants is thus essential to guarantee that the vision is as legitimate as possible. In this process, scientists can introduce and thus suggest their topic of interest to sub-groups of stakeholders. Subsequently, with scientists as facilitators (and thus neutral at this point), stakeholders list the most important elements they wish for the future of their region. The analysis of the stakeholders' vision and scientific input can thus provide some insights about potential overlapping interests. The visioning workshop is conducted before the main steps of the participatory modelling process described above, as this step gives the most freedom for suggestions by stakeholders. In most of the modelling process, it is advisable to start from a wide consideration of descriptive elements before slowly tuning and simplifying the model (Edmonds and Moss 2005) . The vision provides a key story telling component to involve players in the serious game (Mitgutsch and Alvarado 2012; Mildner and Mueller 2016) .",

Game testing and iterative loops of game design is thus essential (Macklin and Sharp 2016) . For a serious game, game testing with domain experts is essential to keep the factual content in line with the described system (Mildner and Mueller 2016) . Additionally, good narrative as well as good aesthetics enhance player's engagement (Mitgutsch and Alvarado 2012) . To guarantee the narrative quality, visioning workshops aim at describing a \"desirable future\" (Myers and Kitsuse 2000; Brondizio et al. 2019 ) and thus guarantee a good level of engagement as the game explores the potential futures of the place these stakeholders live in.

At the time of the design, 2040 was also the time when different climate scenarios started to diverge (van Vuuren et al. 2011) . Before the construction of the visions, the research team presented their perspectives about climate change and adaptation to inform stakeholders of the objectives of the Fig. 2 Presentation of case studies scientific project. Visioning workshops were based on mixed techniques (focus groups together with drawing, writing and participatory mapping). Our scientific team facilitated both French and Swiss visioning workshops but were not included as stakeholders. Eleven stakeholders were involved for this exercise in Switzerland and 45 in France. We invited stakeholders with the intent to balance major sectors and diverse scales of action. Building a vision for each site was done in sub-groups of four to five people and was not limited regarding the array of topics that could be included. In Switzerland, a graphic designer helped each sub-group to build their vision. Summaries of the Swiss and French visions are presented in Table 1 .

Thus, players could manipulate and influence the trajectory of these elements at the heart of their vision for the future. Second, we mobilized two key clusters of the conceptualization in the board game design: (1) dynamics centered on tourism and tourists (bottom and left part of the graph in Fig. 3 , centered on the \"tourist\" actor and the \"secondary residence\"); and (2) dynamics centered on agriculture and the management of pastures and terraces (upper right part of the graph in Fig. 3 , centered on \"terraces\" and \"livestock farmers\").

Facilitators from our team used this feedback to discuss critical barriers on the pathways to the vision. This step is consistent with the backcasting approach we followed. The discussion (2) was an intentional move from the scientific team to question players about the capacity of the SES to follow successful adaptation pathways which is the major topic of interest from our research team .

They are extracted from the observer's report of each game session. The most striking element of this table is the issue regarding governance and power, with seven and five game sessions, respectively, mentioning collective action and decision-making as an issue. Our game design allows quite easy collective action and decision-making as there is only a handful of players, seeing each other face to face. As such, players were keen to indicate the discrepancy between the in-game experience and real-world difficulties. More precisely, throughout these debriefings, well-off local families as well as established institutions [National Park, Municipal councils, to a lesser degree the Pastoral Land Association (PLA)] were often depicted as hindering local development by blocking decisions, top-down decision-making or through regulations. While issues about power sharing at the municipality level is somehow logical for a political institution like a municipality, it is more surprising for the \u00c9crins National Park (ENP). In five game sessions, the ENP was considered by all players as a constraint through the enforcement of regulations and restrictions (Table 5 ). The problem around ENP is all the more critical as it was indirectly connected by players with the issue of wolf impact on farmer livelihoods, also mentioned during three game debriefings (Table 5) . However, the wolf issue is not specific to the case study. As one player put it: \"it is a national drama in the countryside and matter of applause in cities\". Indeed, to many farmers, the ENP is favorable to the wolf's presence, which goes against their interests and is consistent with an urban mindset. A final workshop, attended by the director of the ENP, confirmed the existence of a gap between inhabitants and the park. This situation shows a clear need for concertation to move eventually from a tense, conflictual situation into a more collaborative state.

In particular, the (Table 1 ) and in the French conceptualization model (Fig. 3) , it did not stand out as a key problem during debriefing sessions.

Additionally, these joint problems would require expertise that was not present in our research team. In Switzerland, identified issues were not considered to represent sufficiently high stakes by the game participants and our research team to justify a further participatory process. Despite these difficulties to set a joint problem, the process of openly explore the space of potential collaboration was appreciated by all the parties, and the gaming approach was praised for its inclusiveness, transparency and capacity to generate a unique space of dialogue between diverse parties.",

Even if we had full control on techniques that were used in the process, we also used techniques that limit this power. Notably, visions were built entirely on stakeholder's ideas and wishes. Even when the research team provided some prior background information about climate change and adaptation to participants, that appeared to play no role in influencing the following exercise as visions in both Switzerland and France do not explicitly include anything about these topics. As described in the Results section, during the conceptualization phase, we decided that scientists from our team were significant stakeholders that could not be ignored in describing how the SES works, and one senior scientist was thus included. In this workshop, this scientific stakeholder was one out of five individuals who were not part of the research team and this seemed to be enough as a counterpower. The rest of the team remained at all other times as neutral as possible, following a \"critical companion\" posture (Barnaud and Van Paassen 2013) in facilitation and observational roles. We believe that the process described in this paper is enough to limit scientist power on defining the joint problem, the proof being that, contrary to our research objectives, no joint problem justifying a participatory process was clearly accessible to us. For a research project that would emerge from a political context rather than from scientists (Fig. 1) , a similar transparency about main topics of interest from the political agenda would yield a similar limitation of influence on the game design and outcome.",

            "text": "However, it is important to note that our game design process described here can only demonstrates its capacity to identify the absence of a complex joint problem. As many practitioners of participatory processes are aware of, participatory research does not start from a well-established problem-framing that would legitimize with certainty an intervention and the mobilization of stakeholder's time (Lang et al. 2012 ). The risk of the \"tyranny\" of participation is never far (Cooke et al. 2001) . The lack of post-normal issues, with high stakes and uncertainty, may be one explanation of regularly observed \"stakeholder fatigue\", even though other explanations like poor communication are also possible (J\u00f6nsson and Swartling 2014; Bracken et al. 2015) . Even though using such a game does not come cheap (Barreteau et al. 2014) , especially as funding is usually an issue at the initial stage of a participatory project (Luthe 2017), we suggest that designing a game to assess complex joint problems is worth the investment. Indeed, it can save incredible amount of stakeholder and researcher time and resources in the long-term by not mobilizing them when there is no need for it. In that sense, this game not only assesses the existence of a joint problem but allows, through game debriefing with stakeholders, to assess whether some problems are in the post-normal sphere legitimizing participatory research. However, the assessment that a situation is in such a post-normal frame is not well defined apart from listening to stakeholders' feedback. The process to evaluate more systematically if a situation is with high stakes and high uncertainty remains to be better defined.",

In that case, it proved to be useful because it led to the agreement with our potential research partners that there was no known complex joint problem for participatory research. This potential for reusability in other similar SES can potentially save game development costs while getting the benefit of a joint problem identification assessment.

            "text": "Overall, from our experience, the use of this game for joint problem identification remains limited by three main factors. The first factor relates to the presence of stakeholders around the board game. This device is situational and can only identify joint problems with the players who actually participate in the game. This can be a serious limitation as various stakeholders may have unequal capacities for participation depending on their wealth, education and political power (Agrawal and Gupta 2005; Barnaud et al. 2010) . The second factor is the specific type of SES that is covered by the game, which Klein et al. (2019) call the \"tourism-residential\" type. The game, in its current state, would unlikely be directly transferable to other types of mountain SES mainly living, for example, of pastoral activities. Similarly, the use of the game for the tourism-logging type, close to the tourism-residential type from Klein et al. (2019) in the current form of the game, would probably require the addition of a logging module as this economic activity is not covered in the game. The third limitation is the cost attached to making such a game accessible to a wider public. Even if some game libraries exist online, 1 they usually do not make the game itself available for autonomous use nor do they always describe what can be achieved with it, thus limiting their reusability. We advocate an open and participatory online library where all game designers could make their game available (print and play, models, etc.) and easily accessible for other modelers, game designers and scientists. Accessibility could be enhanced by digitalizing such games, making it accessible worldwide. Some online platform support the creation of virtual board game, like tabletopia or tabletop simulator. This option can be particularly helpful in COVID-19 times when face-to-face meetings are difficult. The capacity of digital serious board game to reach similar engagement with stakeholders is an open question.",
