Patients were included if they had device-measured physical activity data from > 80% of dates across the study period from the start of February 3, 2020 through June 30, 2020. Patients may have had data from < 80% of the study period if their CRMD was implanted or explanted during the study period or if transtelephonic transmissions or device checks were not performed routinely. Patients with neurologic and neuromuscular diseases expected to have a significant impact on physical activity such as hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy or skeletal myopathy were excluded. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of our institution with a waiver of informed consent. Device-measured physical activity data were abstracted from databases kept by the CRMD manufacturers (Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, Minnesota and Boston Scientific, Natick, Massachusetts) or CRMD reports available through our internal electronic medical record in hours of device-measured physical activity per day. Some devices included in this study had a maximum daily device-measured physical activity of 8 h. We additionally collected information regarding the type of CRMD implanted and demographic information including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), and state of residence. We also collected cardiovascular disease-specific information including the nature of cardiovascular disease which we broadly classified as structural congenital heart disease (CHD), cardiomyopathy, atrioventricular conduction disturbances without associated CHD, and inherited arrhythmia syndromes. Patients who did not have a disease process described by any of the aforementioned categories were categorized as 'other'.",

These dates were chosen to correspond with Massachusetts social distancing guidance to assess changes in physical activity before and after SIP orders were given. The primary outcome was hours per day of device-measured physical activity in each time period compared to the baseline period and this relationship was assessed using the paired Student's t tests. We compared the proportion of patients with < 2 h of daily device-measured physical activity at baseline to each of the subsequent time periods using Chi-squared tests. We also performed a subanalysis of children less than 6 years of age using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests. We compared differences in device-measured physical activity in patients with elevated body mass index (BMI; BMI \u2265 85%ile) with those with non-elevated BMIs, between male and female patients and between Massachusetts residents and non-Massachusetts New England residents using Wilcoxon rank-sum tests. Finally, in the subset of patients with activity data available from February through June in 2019, 2020 and 2021, we compared 2020 levels of activity with 2019 and 2021 levels of activity. We also compared activity levels from the baseline period in 2019 with the subsequent 2019 time periods and activity levels from the baseline period in 2021 with subsequent 2021 time periods using paired Student's t tests.

This observation has important local and national implications about responses to surges in COVID-19 infections and future pandemics. Given that the local increase in COVID-19 cases largely coincided with the Massachusetts SIP order, it is difficult to differentiate the roles played by local burden of disease and SIP guidelines in the reduction of device-measured physical activity we observed. It is worth noting, however, that there was a statistically significant decline in devicemeasured physical activity in the 2 weeks preceding the SIP order, suggesting family response to the burden of COVID-19 disease contributed to a decrease in physical activity independent of the SIP order-a response which may have been exaggerated in the families of children with cardiac disease. Additionally, we found no statistically significant reduction in device-measured physical activity in patients living in Massachusetts compared to other states in New England where COVID-19 infections were not as widespread [17] , demonstrating the impact of the pandemic on physical activity across state lines and in places with variable burdens of COVID-19 disease.",

Indeed, device-measured physical activity levels in this subset of patients were significantly lower in each time period in 2020 compared to 2019 including during the defined baseline period. Thus, behavioral modification leading to decreased physical activity likely predated the start of our study period and the decline in 2020 activity from \"baseline\" levels may have been even more dramatic than our analysis suggests. Interestingly, activity levels in the subset of patients for whom we abstracted 2021 device-measured physical activity level data were no different than their levels in 2019, suggesting the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on decreasing activity levels has waned over time.",

Additionally, childhood physical activity has been shown to be a predictor of physical activity in adulthood [22] . Previous studies of children with underlying heart disease have reported rates of elevated BMI similar to the approximately 1 in 3 we found in the present study and thus this is an important issue for this population [21, [23] [24] [25] [26] . Heart rhythm disturbances have been found to be risk factors for obesity possibly secondary to restricted activity secondary to increased risk (or perceived risk) with exercise [26] . Prior work in adults with CRMDs has demonstrated a beneficial impact of physical activity on secondary prevention of life-threatening arrhythmic events and reduction in ICD shocks [27] [28] [29] .

Furthermore, the precise threshold and equivalent level of physical activity is not made available by the device manufacturers. These thresholds are additionally modifiable and it is possible that patients had different thresholds programmed. However, it is not our general practice to modify the activity threshold from the default setting and thus it is unlikely that this contributed to measured variations in activity between patients or in the same patient over time in a meaningful way.
