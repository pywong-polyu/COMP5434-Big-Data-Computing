In addition, this analysis shows precisely where population groups are located that are particularly likely to under-report COVID-19 symptoms because of low physical access to healthcare facilities. Beyond the COVID-19 response, this study can inform countries' efforts to improve care for conditions that are common among older adults, such as chronic noncommunicable diseases.",

Second, this is the first study to comprehensively map both hospitals and primary healthcare facilities, and including both public-and private-sector facilities, across sub-Saharan Africa. Third, because the COVID-19 epidemic causes a far higher need for hospital services among older than younger population groups, we focus on physical access to healthcare for the population aged 60 years and older, which is a population group that is rarely studied in investigations of healthcare demand and supply in the region. As such, our maps can inform not only the health system response to COVID-19, but more generally to conditions that are common among older adults in the region, particularly chronic non-communicable diseases and their sequelae.",

However, there is a wide degree of variation in physical access to healthcare facilities for older adults in the region both between and within countries, which likely has an important bearing on the extent to which different population groups within countries are able to access care for COVID-19. Likewise, in those areas with a long travel time to the nearest healthcare facility of any type (of which there are a considerable number in most countries), symptomatic cases of COVID-19 are particularly unlikely to be reported to the healthcare system. Our highresolution maps for each region and country in sub-Saharan Africa provide precise information about this geographic variation for local, national, and regional policymakers as well as nongovernmental organizations.",

            "text": "Declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on March 11 2020, 1 SARS-CoV-2 has caused over nine million confirmed infections and the disease it can triggercoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)has led to almost 500,000 reported deaths across the world by late June 2020. 2 While low testing numbers do not allow for a reliable assessment of the extent of the epidemic in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), the region had over 300,000 reported infections and almost 9,000 deaths due to SARS-CoV-2 as of June 24 2020. 2 Epidemiological modelling suggests that COVID-19 could lead to between 300,000 and 2.5 million deaths in SSA, depending on modelling assumptions and the mitigation policies that are adopted. 3 There are numerous barriers to receiving high-quality healthcare in SSA, including financial barriers to accessing care, weak supply chains, and understaffing of healthcare facilities. 4 However, physical distance to the nearest healthcare facilityand the associated requirements for transport options, cost of transport, and time lost from other income-generating activitiesconsistently figure as one of the most important barriers to accessing both hospital-based and primary care in the region. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Travel time to the nearest healthcare facility and the nearest hospital will likely also play an important role in the ability of health systems in SSA to respond to SARS-CoV-2 for three main reasons. First, physical access to hospitals will influence whether and how timely individuals with COVID-19 are able to seek healthcare. While many hospitals in SSA are not able to provide mechanical ventilation, 11, 12 other critical components of care for those with severe COVID-19, such as hemodynamic support, supplemental oxygen therapy, and treatment of coinfections (e.g., bacterial pneumonia), are more readily available in hospitals in SSA. 13, 14, 15 Second, physical access to a healthcare facility of any type will impact whether and when during the disease course individuals with COVID-19 contact the healthcare system. These careseeking decisions in turn have important ramifications for whether the health system is notified of COVID-19 cases and, thus, the monitoring of the epidemic, particularly in settings that are unable to conduct large-scale community-based testing for SARS-CoV-2 infections. Third, if these options become widely available in SSA in the future, physical access to healthcare facilities will likely affect to what degree individuals with COVID-19 take up effective medications against the condition and possibly also to what degree they are able to access a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.",

In addition, such knowledge would allow for pinpointing those geographic areas that are most likely to harbour the most cases of COVID-19 that were unreported due to lack of physical access to care, which in turn can inform the geographic targeting of testing efforts. More broadly, understanding where older adults reside who have the least physical access to healthcare can inform health systems' efforts to improve care for conditions that are common in this age group, particularly chronic non-communicable diseases and their sequelae. By assembling a unique dataset from both crowd-sourced data and official records by governments and international organizations, this study, therefore, aimed to create highly detailed maps of estimated travel time for adults aged 60 yeas and older in SSA to both the nearest hospital and the closest healthcare facility of any type.",

Healthcare facilities of any type were chosen as an additional entity of interest because physical access to any healthcare facility likely influences the degree to which individuals with COVID-19 present to the healthcare system and, thus, the extent to which the healthcare system is made aware of new COVID-19 cases.

Barren land and built-up areas were assigned a 5km/h and forests a 2 km/h walking speed. The model was created at a spatial resolution of 100m 2 . For both OSM and MFL data, we calculated the travel time from each cell to the nearest healthcare facility of any type and the closest hospital.

Our study helps fill this important evidence gap for older adults in the region and is, thus, of high relevance for informing countries' efforts to improve care for conditions that affect older adults, particularly chronic non-communicable diseases. Specifically, this study builds on the, to our knowledge, three existing studies that have mapped physical access to healthcare in SSA at a geographic level below countries or administrative regions within countries. Specifically, Ouma et al. have examined access to emergency hospital care in SSA. 28 This study differs from ours in that it focussed on women of child-bearing age (15 to 49 years) rather than older adults, did not include primary healthcare facilities nor any private-sector healthcare facilities, did not use OSM data, employed a cut-off of travel time less or greater than two hours (based on a target set by the Lancet Commissions for Global Surgery 2030 29 ) rather than analysing the whole distribution, analysed data from 2015, and did not provide detailed country-by-country maps. Other relevant studies have focussed on the effect of physical access to a healthcare facility on the probability of seeking care for a febrile episode in children, 30 and estimated travel time to healthcare facilities among populations at risk of viral haemorrhagic fevers. 31 Another key contribution of our study is the collation of a new dataset on geo-tagged healthcare facilities in SSA. By making this dataset available in the public domain and including the location of other age groups (not merely adults aged 60 years and older), we allow researchers and policy makers to run their own analyses for a variety of demographic groups and add to (or alter) the list of geo-tagged healthcare facilities in a country. There is currently no authoritative source of the location of all healthcare facilities in SSA. We have combined data from the only two existing sources of data for the geolocation of healthcare facilities in the region. We chose this approach because it is highly likely that neither dataset is complete, as is evidenced by the fact that in some countries the MFL dataset listed a higher number of healthcare facilities than the OSM data while the opposite was the case in other countries. Because the OSM project relies on volunteers to map and tag healthcare facilities, the OSM data by itself is particularly likely to underestimate the density of healthcare facilities in an area. The fact that OSM contained a higher number of healthcare facilities in many countries than did the MFL dataset, particularly for hospitals, is, however, encouraging in that OSM appears to be a useful source of information for the geolocation of healthcare facilities. Importantly, OSM data are likely to improve over time as coverage of smartphones increases in SSA and more volunteers map out their local areas. We will, therefore, update our dataset on a regular basis. Moving forward, it will be important to continuously monitor the validity of the data entered into the OSM and MFL dataset; a task that would ideally be accomplished by Ministries of Health in SSA.",

First and foremost, while we (by combining MFL with OSM data) likely provide the most comprehensive source of data for the geolocation of healthcare facilities that is currently available, it is still likely to miss a substantial proportion of healthcare facilities. The degree to which this is the case probably varies between countries as both the participation in the OSM project and the degree to which documentation used for the MFL dataset were available and complete differ across countries. 32 Second, we do not have any data on the readiness of healthcare facilities to provide care, nor the quality of care provided at healthcare facilities. Both are likely to vary across and within countries. 33 Third, a limitation of our analysis for the COVID-19 response is that governments may decide that not all hospitals in a country should be providing care for COVID-19. Fourth, our analysis does not take into account that vulnerability to COVID-19 is likely affected by factors beyond age that vary across and within countries, including HIV, tuberculosis, and malnutrition. We decided against including these factors in our analysis because which conditions increase the risk of experiencing a severe disease course, and to what degree, is still largely unknown, especially in SSA. Lastly, our travel time numbers are approximations that, for example, do not take into account the frequency of transport services and assign an estimated (rather than measured) travel speed to different types of roads. Lastly, our analysis focusses on only one aspect of access to healthcare and thus does not, for instance, take into account financial barriers to accessing care.",

If COVID-19 becomes a generalized epidemic that infects large swaths of countries' populations in the region, then it will be older adults living in these areas who are in a particularly high need for either improved transport options to existing hospitals or the provision of make-shift hospital care. Beyond their usefulness for the COVID-19 response, our maps could inform health system planning for conditions that commonly affect older adults, such as expansions of care for myocardial infarctions and strokes.

For healthcare facilities of any type and using a travel time cut-off of two hours, the corresponding proportions were 15.9% (95% CI: 10.1 -24.4) across SSA, ranging from 0.4% (95% CI: 0.0 -4.4) in Burundi to 59.4% (95% CI: 50.1 -69.0) in Sudan (Figure S2). The shape of the distribution of travel time to the nearest hospital for adults aged 60 years and older varied greatly across countries (Figure 1). It ranged from a distribution in which the vast majority of the population is within 60 minutes travel time and there being virtually no right tail to the distribution (e.g., in Burundi), to distributions in which the population was almost equally spread across the range of travel time from 0 to 240 minutes (e.g., in Ethiopia). For the nearest healthcare facility of any type, in contrast, the distribution was more heavily skewed towards very short travel times (Figure 2), with the proportion of adults aged 60 years and older who reside within 30 minutes of traveling to the nearest facility being at least 25% in 43 of our 44 study countries.
