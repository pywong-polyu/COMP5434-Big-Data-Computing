The case-fatality rate for COVID-19 is estimated at 3% to 5% for people 65-74 years of age and increases to about 10-27% for people 85 years and older (Le Couteur et al. 2020) . With this relatively high fatality rate, older adults can easily be targeted and labeled as vulnerable. However, older adults belong to a very diverse group-some have serious chronic health problems that would make them more susceptible to negative outcomes, but others remain healthy and active. Although the risk for older adults to contract COVID-19 is high, it must be noted that severe infections and significant mortality occur across the entire life course (Le Couteur et al. 2020 ). There is a possibility that during this pandemic old stereotypes reinforcing ageist perceptions are revived (Ayalon et al. 2020) .",

Furthermore, we should not talk about older adults but rather give this age group a voice in their own matters. The Gerontological Society of America has launched The Reframing Aging Initiative (Gerontological Society of America 2020) that underlines the importance of understanding inclusive language when communicating about COVID-19.",

Given stay-at-home policies, intergenerational ties are restricted, and the overall solidarity among parents, grandchildren, children, and grandchildren may be compromised. When younger adults get the impression that they are to stay at home to keep older adults safe, intergenerational resentment may ensue. Comparing active and productive younger adults to frail and vulnerable older adults does not help either generation come to terms with this crisis. Such views may underline negative images of aging among younger adults (Ayalon et al. 2020) . It is obvious that the COVID-19 challenge can have severe effects on developmental outcomes. As people get more frustrated over time, they may experience increased negative emotions, and these emotional experiences may be more difficult to regulate. Because of restrictions in movement, more loneliness or social isolation may occur. There is more of a risk for domestic abuse. In addition to these psychological and behavioral effects, we can also expect changes in physical health. As visiting a health practitioner is more limited and people feel more restricted at home (with heightened stress levels, limited physical exercise, less emphasis on good nutritional habits and disrupted sleep patterns), the pandemic may result in lasting effects on adult development (Schrack et al. 2020) .",

Personal resilience refers to individual strength, personality, control, and the ability to use cognitive and behavioral strategies to deal with stressful situations effectively. Family resilience refers to optimal communication patterns and family cohesiveness during a time of crisis. Resilient communities develop environmental plans that allow people to feel safe when adversity hits. Studies suggest that negative perceptions are associated with loneliness and psychological distress, whereas positive self-perceptions of aging are associated with more resilience during the COVID-19 outbreak (Losada-Baltar et al. 2020) .",

We will fast track appropriate manuscripts that highlight how pandemics and other national crises affect the development of adults of all ages.
