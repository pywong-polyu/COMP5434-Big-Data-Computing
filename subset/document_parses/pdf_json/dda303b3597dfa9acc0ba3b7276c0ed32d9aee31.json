However, it is still unknown how this distinctiveness advantage emerges in human vision. Here, we studied how visual distinctiveness signals along two feature dimensions-shape and surface texture-combine to determine the overall distinctiveness of an object in the scene. Distinctiveness scores between a target object and distractors were measured separately for shape and texture using a search task. These scores were then used to predict search times when a target differed from distractors along both shape and texture. Model comparison showed that the overall object distinctiveness was best predicted when shape and texture combined using a Euclidian metric, confirming the brain is computing independent distinctiveness scores for shape and texture and combining them to direct attention.",

Most theories of vision and attention propose that attention is guided by the specific feature values that belong to the object we are looking for [1] [2] [3] . Less is known about the specific mechanisms underlying attentional guidance by features, particularly when the target object we are looking for differs from other elements in the scene along more than one visual feature. How are these featural differences combined to guide attention? Are there mechanistic laws that describe how attention is simultaneously guided by multiple features? Imagine you just finished cooking a dish and are looking for a plate to serve it. You know exactly what plate you are looking for: a white dome-like plate that has a blue-dotted pattern. Imagine searching for that specific bowl (your target) on a table that has many other plates (the distractors) that vary in shape and texture, like on Fig. 1 . Does the visual system use both the overall shape and texture information to tell the target apart from the distractors? Here, we investigated the precise underlying laws that govern how texture and shape combine to guide attention in human vision during a search task.",

            "text": "Recent work demonstrated the existence of a mathematical law that describes how color and shape combine to guide visual attention in efficient search 4 . When observers are searching for a known target that differs from surrounding objects in terms of color and shape, the visual system computes the visual distinctiveness between the known features of the target and the distractors. Specifically, a difference signal is computed in parallel and separately for each feature. In the case of color and shape the overall distinctiveness of the target is determined by the sum of the separate color and shape distinctiveness signals. What is visual distinctiveness and how can it be estimated? According to Target Contrast Signal Theory 5 , visual distinctiveness reflects the difference or distance between two points in feature space, the first point being associated with the target and the second with the distractor. As described below in more details, the visual system uses visual distinctiveness signals computed throughout the visual field to reject distractors that are unlikely to be the target. In this view, Target Contrast Signal Theory 5 therefore separates itself from theories that assume attentional guidance is driven by specific feature values [1] [2] [3] , and is more in line with theories positing attention is guided by difference signals between target and non-target items 4, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Note however that people can use peripheral vision to reject distractors 5, [12] [13] [14] only when the feature differences between the target object and the distractors are sufficiently large 12, 15, 16 . When the feature differences are too small, people must rely on the fine visual analysis provided by foveal vision.",

This logarithmic relationship between set size and response times is the signature that items are processed in parallel and with unlimited capacity 12, 18 ; in the process of finding the target, the visual system accumulates information, stochastically, in the form of a contrast signal generated when comparing an item to the target template.

Displays were always distractor homogeneous, meaning that only one distractor type was presented at a time. Results show that search efficiency, here indexed by the logarithmic search slope, varies as a function of target-distractor similarity. Search becomes less efficient when target-distractor similarity increases. (B) Example of shape search. The Figure shows reaction times when searching for a gray triangle among a varying number of gray diamonds, circles or semicircles. (C) Search efficiency observed in simple color and shape searches can be used to predict performance when the target differs from distractors both along color and shape. For instance, search efficiencies when searching for red among yellow (A) and when searching for triangle among diamonds (B) were used to predict performance when participants searched for a red triangle target among yellow diamonds.

(2)) of a target that differs from distractors along two separate features, say a red triangle among yellow diamonds, one needs to determine the visual distinctiveness along the color feature space and along the shape feature space. That is, logarithmic search efficiencies must be obtained when searching for a red triangle target among yellow triangle distractors (color search; Fig. 2A ) and when searching for a gray triangle target among gray diamond distractors (shape search; Fig. 2B ). Buetti et al. 4 tested different equations to determine how the contrast along color and the contrast along shape should be combined and found that Eq. (2) was the best formula to determine the overall visual distinctiveness between target and distractors when the stimuli differed along color and shape. Given that the visual distinctiveness is related to the logarithmic search slope as indicated in Eq. (1), if one replaces Eqs. (1) into Eq. (2), Eq. (3) and (4) obtain, with D color being the logarithmic slope observed in color search for a specific target-distract pairing and D shape being the logarithmic slope observed in shape search for a specific targetdistractor pairing.

Participants were asked to ignore the other dimension (e.g., width). If the irrelevant dimension affected the speed at which participants sorted the relevant dimension, the two dimensions were defined as integral. If no such interference was observed, the two dimensions were called separable. Garner 22 showed that the dissimilarity along separable feature dimensions (e.g., color and shape 4,24 ) combine linearly, following a city-block metric; on the other hand, dissimilarity along integral feature dimensions (e.g., saturation and brightness of Munsell colors 23 ) combine following a Euclidean distance metric.

Texture as a visual feature has been mostly studied with regards to the process of texture segmentation [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] , that is, the study of the conditions under which the visual system can effortlessly or \"pre-attentively\" separate two regions of the scene based on textural differences. These regions are constructed by repeating elements and the question is which featural characteristics of those repeated elements afford segmentation in a parallel fashion without requiring serial attention to individual elements. Julesz 27, 28 showed that texture segmentation can happen effortlessly when the repeating elements differ along color, elongated blobs (i.e., line segments with different orientations and widths), and terminators (the end-points of the elongated blobs). Differences in size, and contrast can also afford texture segmentation 30 . More generally, texture segmentation is thought to arise from analysis of global display properties, that is, properties shared by many items, that differ across different regions of the display and that may be unavailable at the single item level 34 . For instance, the average orientation of lines in one region of the display may differ from the average orientation of lines around that region, creating a segmentation clue.",

That is, we know that color is a powerful guiding feature 35 , but if we go beyond color to the shape patterns that may exist on the surface of objects, it is less clear how well the human visual system can analyze that information and use it to guide attention in a scene. One might intuit that if a shape pattern affords segmentation when embedded in a second shape pattern, then visual search for objects with that shape pattern ought to be parallel and effortless, and vice-versa. But this is not the case 34 . There are shape patterns that can afford effortless segmentation without giving rise to parallel search. The reverse is also true. There are shape patterns that can be found in parallel but nonetheless do not afford effortless segmentation. According to Wolfe 34 , the reason for this is that segmentation follows analysis of global properties of the scene, whereas search is focused on properties of individual objects in that scene. In fact, when there is only one target in the display, the availability of its visual properties as \"global\" properties of the display is vastly diminished, compared to when multiple identical items share that same property in close proximity of one another (as in texture segmentation).",

The authors focused on the inverse of reaction time (1/RT) at a fixed set size, as a measure of the distance between target and distractors in feature space 36 , that is, as a measure of targetdistractor dissimilarity. A weighted linear combination model was used to compute the expected 1/RT score in a bi-dimensional search condition (when the target differed from distractors along both texture and shape) based on the 1/RT scores in the unidimensional searches. The results showed that the unidimensional search parameters for texture and shape were sufficient to account for 83% of the variance observed in bidimensional search displays. Although successful, the methodology has some shortcomings. Because the parameters are estimated at a specific set size, the fitted model is only capable of interpreting the data at this fixed set size; this harms the generalizability of the model because the dissimilarity score between the same two stimuli is different for different levels of set size. Further, the 1/RT measure compounds search-related processing time with non-search processing time, such as response selection and execution, which contaminates the dissimilarity metric and makes it less accurate in reflecting the searching process. Finally, the authors only used weighted linear combinations in their formulas and did not include comparison to other non-linear metrics like the Euclidian distance metric 22 .

Buetti et al. 4 showed that for color and shape the visual system is computing visual distinctiveness values for each feature dimension www.nature.com/scientificreports/ separately, which are then combined linearly to guide attention. The present study investigated two different feature dimensions: shape and surface texture. Several conclusions can be drawn from the present results. First, the results indicated that textural information alone can guide attention in parallel across the scene, indicating that peripheral vision can compute visual distinctiveness signals arising from the surface properties of objects. This follows because the RT by set size functions in Experiment 1B were logarithmic (data shown in Supplementary Information Fig. S1 ), a behavioral index of parallel guidance across the scene 4, 5, 12 . In sum, this demonstrates for the first time that other surface properties beside color 35 can guide attention, specifically, shape-defined textural elements present on the surface of objects.",

This finding makes sense if one considers the surface textures used in the present study as shapes within shapes. In that sense, the stimuli here can be understood as hierarchical stimuli, much like Navon letters: they each have a global feature property (i.e., the overall shape of the object) and a local feature property (i.e., the smaller shapes inside the object boundaries). The global feature (shape) would be carried over low spatial frequency channels and the local feature (texture) would be carried over relatively higher spatial frequency channels but importantly, both would rely on the same brain areas for processing. When viewed from this perspective, the finding that both the global and local features used here concurrently guide attention is consistent with Miller's 38 proposal that, more generally speaking, local and global properties of objects are processed in parallel and are available at the same time to guide attention.",

It is not the case that the feature dimension with the greatest guidance will drive performance, as evidenced by the finding that the Best Feature Guidance model was outperformed by the Orthogonal Contrast Integration Model which takes into consideration differences along both feature dimensions. Thus, this suggests that when processing information in parallel, the visual system uses all available distinctiveness signals to guide attention. This observation is consistent with Buetti et al. 's 4 findings showing that shape contributed to guidance even though it was systematically less efficient than color. An implication of this finding is that the more information an observer has about the visual properties of a target, the more efficient the observer will be at finding that target. This is consistent with previous findings showing that the more precise the target-defining cue is (verbal label vs. categorical example vs. exact image of the target), the more efficient the search becomes 39, 40 . These findings are also consistent with the \"information summation\" proposal 41 . In that study, the authors studied whether observers rely on contour cues and/or surface texture cues (composed of small Gabor elements) when detecting the presence of a large shape in a field of randomly oriented Gabors. The authors found that observers simultaneously used both cues in a manner that allowed them to perform better than if they had relied on either of the two cues, or even on the best of both cues. This indicated that information about contour and surface texture was combined in the visual system (much like in Eq. (8)) to improve the detectability of an object in noise.",

We suggest this inconsistency may arise from the type of visual processing used to perform the tasks. For example, the speed-classification task 19,25 relies on foveal vision. Similarly, the oddball detection task 20 also relies on foveal vision (observers were free to foveate the stimuli over long periods of time to decide which of three shapes was different from the other two along either shape or material texture properties). Thus, it is possible that in tasks where only one object at a time is examined with foveal vision, observers might be able to maintain the representation of the two feature dimensions separately (giving rise to evidence for separable dimensions). In contrast, in a parallel search task where multiple objects are presented in the periphery, observers might no longer be able to maintain distinct representations. In this case, the representations of texture and shape might be combined into a single dimensional feature space that characterizes each object at a given location. This would occur because of the properties of peripheral vision. Indeed, peripheral vision tends to represent information in a pooled manner, where visual information at a given location is pooled into a summary representation of the information at that location 15 , as opposed to the detailed representations afforded by foveal vision. Therefore, when studying how two or more features combine, it seems important to consider not only the specific features in question but also the type of visual processing (foveal vs. peripheral) involved in representing those features. These findings further suggest that while certain feature combinations are pooled (like shape and texture, as shown here), other feature combinations (like shape and color, see Buetti et al. 4 ) appear to survive pooling, as also shown in the visual crowding literature [42] [43] [44] .",

Distinctiveness signals along color and shape dimensions combine linearly 4 , while signals along surface texture and shape combine orthogonally, likely reflecting the differences in the way the visual system represents those feature dimensions in the first place. This critical idea behind Target Contrast Signal theory that contrast is the main currency of the visual system and the force that guides attention makes sense from a neurobiological perspective. Most of the visual brain is wired to compute contrasts. For instance, most color-coding neurons in the early visual system code color contrasts as opposed to specific color values and are present as early as the LGN 48, 49 , in fact, they are computed even before visual information leaves the eyeball 50 . A contrast computation is also at the basis of all lateral inhibition signals 51 , of the color system 52 , of boundary detection 53 , and perhaps even of visual categorization 54 . This idea that the contrast or difference between two stimuli is critical for determining search performance is also consistent with evidence from neuroscience showing search speed is proportional to the discriminability between patterns of neuronal activity in visual cortex that respond to target and distractors [55] [56] [57] . Perhaps theories of visual attention should shift the focus away from arguing that specific feature values guide attention 1, 2, 35, 58, 59 , and towards a more relational consideration, where attention is guided by the context in which features present themselves, as proposed by Target Contrast Signal theory 5 and the relational account of attentional guidance [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .",

A total of five experiments were conducted (Experiment 1A, 1B, 2A, 2B and 2C), each with a naive group of participants.

Sample size was determined based on previous studies in our lab showing that averaging the data of twenty subjects produces stable estimates of the group means of reaction times and search slopes for a given search condition [12] [13] [14] 17 , and is sufficient to obtain substantial differentiation between models 4,45-47 . For each experiment, two inclusion criteria were used: search accuracy should be higher than 90% and the individual's average response time should fall within two standard deviations of the group average response time. Data collection was stopped as soon as 20 participants met these two criteria. As a result, 20 Note that the present study was pre-registered on OSF (link: https ://osf.io/br965 ). The goal of the pre-registration was to propose to re-run Experiments 2A-C with new groups of na\u00efve participants to confirm the results of the model comparison in a separate independent sample. In the pre-registration, we proposed to run 35 participants in each group in the confirmatory study to improve the precision of RT estimates. Unfortunately, due to the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, all data collection at our institution was halted. At that time, we had collected a total of 16, 19, and 8 participants in the three two-feature dimensions experiments.

All experiments were programmed in Matlab using Psychophysics Toolbox 3.0 extension and run on 64-bit Windows7 PCs. All stimuli were presented on a 20-CRT monitors at an 85 Hz refresh rate and with a 1024 \u00d7 768 resolution. Stimuli were about 45 \u00d7 45 pixels in size, 1.88 \u00d7 1.88 degrees in visual angle, randomly assigned to a location on the display based on two circular grids centered at the center of the screen. The larger grid had a diameter of 557 pixels (22. 74 degrees in visual angle), and the smaller grid had a diameter of 300 pixels (12.39 degrees in visual angle). All the stimuli were gray, shown on a white background. Only one type of distractors was shown on the display on a given trial (i.e., displays were homogeneous). In all experiments, the stimuli had a black square on either the left or right side of the shape and participants were asked to report the location of the square on the target stimulus. In Experiment 1A (shape search), the stimuli shared the same texture, a white cross on a grey background. The stimuli varied in their shape: the target was an octagon and the distractors were either triangles, squares, or houses.",

Bottom Observed RTs from Experiment 2A-C as a function of Predicted RTs. Predicted RTs were estimated using Eq. (5). The left, middle, and right panels show the prediction accuracy of Eq.

Error bars on each data point indicate the standard error of the observed reaction time for each specific condition. on the Best Feature Guidance Model (Eq. (6)), the Orthogonal Contrast Combination Model (Eq. (7)), and the Collinear Contrast Integration Model (Eq. (8)). Equation (5) therefore produced a precise RT for each of the set size tested in Experiments 2A-C. The results indicated that the R 2 of the Orthogonal Contrast Combination Model (90.13%) was higher than the R 2 of the Best Feature Guidance (87.45%) and Collinear Contrast Integration (87.69%) models. The AIC model comparison results showed that the Orthogonal Contrast Combination Model (AIC = 288.45) was 75 times more likely than the Best Feature Guidance Model (AIC = 297.10) and 53 times more likely the Collinear Contrast Integration Model (AIC = 296.39). Furthermore, we computed the mean prediction error to evaluate the accuracy of the predictions of each model. The mean prediction error was obtained by computing the mean of the absolute differences between the observed RTs in Experiments 2A-C and the RTs predicted by each model using Eq. (5). Larger values indicate that the predicted RTs are scattered more widely around the observed values. Smaller values indicate that the predicted RTs are more tightly clustered around the observed values. The Orthogonal Contrast Combination Model showed a smaller prediction error (14.16 ms) than the Best Feature Guidance Model (25.32 ms), t(35) = 3.41, p = 0.002, dz = 0.824, BF = 20.17, and than the Collinear Contrast Integration Model (26.68 ms), t(35) = 5.41, p < 0.001, dz = 1.307, BF = 4200.37. Note that the prediction range was about 200 ms (observed RT range 563-757 ms), so the magnitude of the mean prediction error of the winning model was about 7% of the overall prediction range. In fact, 35 of the 36 predictions of the winning model (Orthogonal Contrast Combination Model) fell within the margin of error of the observed data (i.e., inside an interval centered on the observed mean plus or minus 1.96 times the standard error of the observed mean).",
