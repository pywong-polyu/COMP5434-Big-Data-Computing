SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA \u03b2-coronavirus that targets cells through the viral structural spike (S) protein that binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 4 Upon receptor binding, the virus particle uses host cell receptors and endosomes to enter cells. The host cellular protease transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) helps cell entry via the S protein. Viral polyproteins are then synthesized that encode for the replicase\u2212transcriptase complex. Viral RNA synthesis is then achieved using RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Epidemiological studies have shown that each infection can result in 1.4\u22123.9 new cases when no one is immune or preventative measures such as social distancing have not been undertaken. It is primarily spread between humans through small droplets from the nose or mouth when an infected person coughs or sneezes. 5 As of May 30, 2020, there have been over 6 million confirmed cases of COVID-19, which have resulted in 370 000 deaths worldwide. 6a Although the majority of cases of COVID-19 infection were first reported in China, the virus has now spread to 185 countries, 6b with the U.S. now leading the world in both total number of infections and deaths. Symptoms can show up anywhere from 2 to 14 days after exposure, and it also possible for an infected person to show no symptoms (so-called asymptomatic disease).

According to the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), there are over 590 diagnostics, either developed or under development, for SARS-CoV-2 worldwide. 7 Estimates in the U.S. suggest that 52 people per thousand have been tested for COVID-19 as of May 30, 2020, a number that continues to grow daily as more people are tested. 6a The majority of NAATs focus on detecting SARS-CoV-2 viral RNA through quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) tests. 8 One of the first tests to get approved by the FDA was the Abbott RealTime SARS-CoV-2 Assay, 9 which is a real-time RT-qPCR test intended for the qualitative detection of nucleic acid from SARS-CoV-2 collected from either nasal, nasopharyngeal (NP), or oropharungeal (OP) swabs. Results from these tests, which require in-house clinical amplification and detection machines, can take 4\u22126 h for a result. Most recently, the same company has developed an even faster test called ID NOW COVID-19, which cuts the processing time from hours to as little as 5 min for a positive result and 13 min for a negative result. 10 This particular test utilizes isothermal nucleic acid amplification for qualitative detection of SARS- CoV-2 viral RNA collected by the same means as above. The FDA has now authorized the first molecular test that uses saliva (instead of nose or throat swabs), which is being developed by Rutgers RUCDR Infinite Biologics. 11 An emerging group of tests can now detect antibodies to the disease (viz., serology tests), which can be used to better quantify the number of people infected with COVID-19, including those that could be asymptomatic or have recovered. These tests will also help authorities in diagnosis, population surveillance, and potential return-to-work actions. These bloodderived tests fall into three categories: (1) rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), (2) enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs), and (3) neutralization assays. 12 In most cases, these test for patient antibodies (immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer) in a qualitative or quantitative readout ( Table 2) . 13 Currently, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is evaluating two serological tests, and multiple other manufacturers have tests under development. It is worth noting that there are still limitations associated with serology testing, as it may take many days postinfection to generate these initial IgM antibodies that are indicative of an active or recent infection.

REMDESIVIR 5.1. History, Mechanism of Action, and Status of Clinical Trials. Designed and developed by Gilead Sciences, remdesivir, formally known as GS-5734, is a broad-spectrum antiviral agent that has been studied clinically, so far unsuccessfully, for the treatment of Ebola. According to the Summary on Compassionate Use document provided by the European Medicines Agency (EMA), remdesivir is a prodrug of a monophosphate nucleoside analogue. 18 Remdesivir is seen as a promising potential therapy for COVID-19 because of its broad-spectrum in vitro activity against several strains of coronavirus, including SARS-CoV-2, with EC 50 and EC 90 values of 0.77 and 1.76 \u03bcM, respectively. 19, 20 Previously, in a mouse MERS-CoV lung infection model, remdesivir reduced viral lung titers more than lopinavir, ritonavir, and interferon beta-1a. 21 Remdesivir is administered via intravenous (iv) infusion, and the safety and pharmacokinetics have been evaluated in both single-and multiple-dose Phase I clinical trials for Ebola. 22 In humans, remdesivir has a half-life of about 1 h in plasma, as it is rapidly converted to the intermediate monophosphate metabolite and the nucleoside metabolite GS-441524 (Scheme 1). Inside cells, the monophosphate is converted to a pharmacologically active analogue of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), GS-443902, that inhibits viral RNA polymerases. In vitro studies have shown that the nucleoside triphosphate acts as an analogue of ATP and competes with the natural ATP Clinical trials are underway to evaluate both the safety and antiviral activity in patients with mild to moderate or severe COVID-19. Table 4 summarizes seven clinical trials initiated in February and March 2020 that are planning to enroll about 9000 patients. 23 The first five studies listed compare 5 or 10 days of remdesivir (200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg daily), dosed intravenously either alone or on top of the standard of care, versus placebo or the standard of care. The last two trials listed compare remdesivir against other antiviral agents and against the standard of care.

Over a median follow-up of 18 days after receiving the first dose of remdesivir, 36 out of 53 patients (68%) showed an improvement in the category of oxygen support, whereas eight out of 53 patents (15%) showed worsening. 24 A recent unpublished Phase III clinical trial undertaken at the University of Chicago Medical Center that recruited 125 patients, most with severe COVID-19 disease, showed that remdesivir can quickly reduce both fever and respiratory symptoms associated with the infection. Again, this study did not have a control arm, with all patients receiving daily iv infusions of the drug. 25 The Adaptive COVID-19 Treatment Trial, a 1063-patient clinical trial sponsored by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), is a well-controlled clinical trial with remdesivir that reported out preliminary results on April 29, 2020. 26a,b The independent Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) overseeing the trial concluded that hospitalized patients with advanced COVID-19 who received remdesivir recovered more quickly than patients who received placebo. The remdesivir cohort had a statistically significant 31% faster time to recovery than the placebo group (11 days vs 15 days). Recovery was defined as either hospital discharge or return to normal activity. Mortality improved from 11.6% to 8.0%, which was just outside of statistical significance (p = 0.059). 26a,b On the basis of this study, the FDA approved the use of remdesivir as an emergency treatment for COVID-19 on May 1, 2020. 27 A smaller multicenter study in China that enrolled 237 severe adult COVID-19 patients, published on April 29, 2020, found Scheme 2.

An early medicinal chemistry route that has been further optimized has been published and patented by Gilead. 28\u221232 The first process to remdesivir generated both diastereomers (5.7-Rp and 5.7-Sp), requiring separation by chiral chromatography (Scheme 2). 28\u221232 The synthesis started with the glycosylation reaction of benzyl-protected ribolactone 5.1 with bromide 5.2. Two methods for metal\u2212halogen exchange were reported. In the first method, 2 was treated with trimethylsilyl chloride (TMSCl) in THF at room temperature to generate silylated 5.2a, which was then cooled to \u221278\u00b0C and treated with n-BuLi followed by addition of lactone 5.1. The reaction was quenched with HOAc. After aqueous workup and chromatography, 5.3 was isolated in 25% yield as a 1:1 mixture of anomers. The second method involved treatment of 5.2 with NaH and 1,2-bis-(chlorodimethylsilyl)ethane to generate silyl compound 5.2b, followed by lithiation with n-BuLi at \u221278\u00b0C and addition of lactone 5.1. This method provided 5.3 in 60% yield. The authors noted that both methods were capricious, with deprotonation likely occurring \u03b1 to the lactone moiety. Cyanation of hydroxyl nucleoside 5.3 using TMSCN mediated by boron trifluoride etherate was carried out in dichloromethane at \u221278\u00b0C to afford cyano nucleoside 5.4, which was isolated as an 89:11 mixture of the \u03b1 and \u03b2 anomers in 58% yield after isolation by chromatography. Deprotection of the benzyl groups was conducted with boron trichloride in dichloromethane, and the desired \u03b2-anomer 5.5 was isolated in 74% yield after reversedphase chromatography. Coupling with the diastereomeric mixture of phosphoramidoyl chloridate 5.6 was carried out in anhydrous trimethyl phosphate and THF with N-methylimidazole (NMI) (3 equiv) to furnish the diastereomeric mixture of 5.7-Sp and 5.7-Rp in 21% yield after preparative HPLC.

HYDROXYCHLOROQUINE 6.1. History, Mechanism of Action, and Status of Clinical Trials. Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ, 4.2) and chloroquine (CQ, 4.3) have been long-standing oral drugs for the treatment of malaria and chronic inflammatory conditions, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). 38 HCQ, a racemic mixture, was first approved in the U.S. in 1955 and is considered the first-line treatment for SLE, raising potential concerns of drug shortages for these patients to treat COVID-19 during this crisis.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 938, "end": 940, "text": "38", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "REPURPOSED SMALL-MOLECULE TREATMENTS FOR COVID-19"}, {"text": "In malaria, CQ is known to inhibit the action of heme polymerase in malarial trophozites, preventing the conversion of heme to hemozin. 39 This causes a buildup of toxic heme, killing the parasite. If HCQ proves to be effective for SARS-CoV-2, it will not act by the same mechanism by which the drug functions as an antimalarial. HCQ and CQ are lipophilic weak bases and passively diffuse through cell membranes and into endosomes, lysosomes, and Golgi vesicles, where they become protonated, trapping them in the organelles and raising the pH. 20 It is postulated that this increase in the pH in endosomes prevents virus particles from utilizing their activity for fusion and entry into the cell. 40 CQ is known to inhibit terminal glycosylation of ACE2, the receptor that SARS-CoV-2 targets for cell entry. When ACE2 is in its unglycosylated state, it may less efficiently interact with the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, further inhibiting viral entry. 40 CQ inhibits SARS-CoV-2 in vitro with a half-maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) in the low micromolar range. HCQ has in vitro activity with a lower EC 50 for SARS-CoV-2 compared with chloroquine after 24 h of growth (HCQ, EC 50 = 6.14 \u03bcM; CQ, EC 50 = 23.90 \u03bcM). 41 HCQ and CQ are relatively well tolerated drugs and have been extensively tested in patients with SLE and malaria. However, both compounds can cause serious adverse effects, including QTc prolongation, hypoglycemia, retinopathy, and neuropsychiatric effects. 42, 43 There is currently no high-quality clinical evidence that HCQ or CQ has efficacy versus SARS, MERS, or SARS-CoV-2. Currently there are over 142 trials that have been registered globally involving either CQ or HCQ alone or in combination with other drugs such as azithromycin. Clinicaltrials.gov currently has over 99 clinical trials registered for the use of HCQ to treat or prevent COVID-19 (Table 5) . 44 Typical clinical doses vary between 200 and 400 mg orally either once or twice daily for 7\u221214 days (and up to 60 days). A 200 mg dose of HCQ has an exceptional human half-life of 537 h in blood and 2963 h in plasma. 45 In the body, HCQ is rapidly N-dealkylated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 to its active metabolite desethylhydroxychloroquine in addition to the inactive metabolites desethylchloroquine (DCQ) and bidesethylchloroquine (BDCQ) (Scheme 5). 46 A recent open-label nonrandomized study in France that was published on March 20, 2020, in the International Journal of Antimicrobial Agents described the treatment of 42 patients hospitalized with COVID-19, 26 of whom received hydroxychloroquine and 16 of whom received routine care. 47 Twenty patients receiving 200 mg of hydroxychloroquine orally every 8 h reported improved virological clearance versus the standard of care. By day 6, virological clearance was 70% (14/20) versus 12.5% (2/16) for the hydroxychloroquine and control groups, respectively.

Synthesis of Hydroxychloroquine.

The resulting tertiary amine 6.3 was isolated in 44% yield after vacuum distillation. The reductive amination of 6.3 was carried out in methanolic ammonia with 1000 psi hydrogen for 24 h at room temperature catalyzed by Raney nickel.

Most of favipiravir's preclinical data are associated with its influenza and Ebola activity, but the compound has demonstrated broad activity versus other RNA viruses. 69 The in vitro EC 50 of favipiravir against SARS-CoV-2 is 61.88 \u03bcM/L in Vero E6 cells. 20 The human bioavailability of FPV is very high at 98%; its metabolites are predominantly renally cleared, and its half-life is estimated to range from 2 to 5.5 h. 70 The most frequent adverse events of FPV reported during the development for influenza treatment include mild to moderate diarrhea, asymptomatic increase of blood uric acid and transaminases, and decrease of neutrophil count. 73 FPV has been approved for use in clinical trials for COVID-19 in China and also for experimental use in Italy, especially in the most affected regions. 74 Limited and smaller-patient-number clinical trials are underway using an FPV starting dose of 1600 mg twice daily on day 1 followed by 600 mg twice daily for the next 9 days (Table 6) . 75 A few of these trials are comparing FPV with chloroquine or in combination with other drugs such as tocilizumab.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 243, "end": 245, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 331, "end": 333, "text": "72", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 564, "end": 566, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 933, "end": 935, "text": "69", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1021, "end": 1023, "text": "20", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1186, "end": 1188, "text": "70", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1416, "text": "73", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1571, "text": "74", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1760, "text": "75", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 246, "end": 254, "text": "Figure 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1755, "text": "(Table 6)", "ref_id": "TABREF11"}], "section": "FAVIPIRAVIR"}, {"text": "To date, there is little clinical evidence that this drug has benefit for COVID-19, so further clinical trials are warranted.

Routes from the Innovator Company, Toyama Chemicals. While favipiravir is a very small molecule, with a molecular weight of only 157, its synthesis is not trivial. The first route to favipiravir reported by Toyama Chemicals (Scheme 9) required six steps with an overall yield of about 2%. 78 As is often the case with medicinal chemistry routes, which are designed to quickly generate analogues, several steps were unoptimized with low yields. The synthesis started with methyl 3-amino-6-bromopyrazine-2carboxylate (7.1), which was diazotized in concentrated sulfuric Diazotization/fluorination was conducted using sodium nitrite in 70% pyridinium hydrofluoride to afford fluoro compound 7.6 in 86% yield. In the final step, conversion of the methoxy group to the hydroxyl group was accomplished with in situ-generated TMSI in acetonitrile to furnish favipiravir in 15% yield. 78 A second-generation route was disclosed on a multigram to a few hundred gram scale by Toyama in 2001 (Scheme 10). 79 The synthesis started with 3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide (7.7), 80 which was nitrated with sodium nitrate in concentrated sulfuric acid at 30\u221240\u00b0C. Nitro compound 7.8 was crystallized by adding the reaction mixture to water and then slurried in dilute NaOH, resulting in an isolated yield of 65%. Nitropyrazine 7.8 was treated with phosphorus oxychloride and pyridine with a ramp in temperature from 60 to 100\u00b0C, resulting in displacement of both the nitro and hydroxyl groups with chlorine and dehydration of the amide to the nitrile. After aqueous workup and silica chromatography, 3,6-dichloropyrazine-2-carbonitrile (7.9) was isolated in 77% yield. Displacement of both chlorines with fluorines was accomplished with KF and n-Bu 4 NBr in DMSO at 90\u2212100\u00b0C for 6 h. After aqueous workup and silica chromatography, 7.10 was isolated in 79% yield. Hydrolysis of the nitrile to the carboxamide was carried out with 12 M HCl and THF at 30\u221235\u00b0C to afford 3,6difluoropyrazine-2-carboxamide (7.11) in 84% yield. Selective hydrolysis of the 3-F group with sodium bicarbonate at 50\u00b0C in dioxane/water provided crystalline favipiravir in 52% yield.

Alternatively, hydroxyl compound 7.20 could be directly converted to fluoro compound 7.22 with 2,2-difluoro-1,3dimethylimidazolidine (7.23); 83d however, the yield with this expensive fluorinating agent was modest at 44% after isolation by silica chromatography. Opening of the isoxazole with aqueous NaOH in THF revealed the nitrile 7.12, which was purified by treatment with an ion-exchange resin and then hydrolyzed to the amide (favipiravir) with basic hydrogen peroxide.

Condensation of 7.25 with an aqueous solution of glyoxal in 2-PrOH at 41\u00b0C, with control of the pH at 9.0 by dropwise addition of sodium carbonate, provided pyrazine N-oxide 7.26 in 62% yield after crystallization, which was converted to oxime 7.27 in 88% yield by treatment with isoamyl nitrite and acetyl chloride in 2-PrOH and crystallization from the reaction mixture. Ring closure and chlorination upon treatment with phosphorus oxychloride in toluene/DMF at 70\u00b0C afforded isopropyl ester 7.21P in 49% yield.

PIRFENIDONE Pirfenidone (5-methyl-1-phenyl-2-[1H]-pyridone, 4.13), marketed by Roche under the trade name Esbriet, is an immunosuppressant that has been approved in many regions for the treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. 99 8.1. History, Mechanism of Action, and Status of Clinical Trials. In vitro evidence shows that pirfenidone inhibits collagen synthesis, downregulates profibrotic cytokines, and decreases fibroblast proliferation, 100\u2212102 and this has translated well into animal models of fibrosis. 103 Pirfenidone has also been shown to reduce the production of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) in both cells and isolated human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), which is consistent with both the antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory activities seen in fibrosis animal models. 104, 105 The absolute bioavailability of pirfenidone has not been determined in humans. Pirfenidone is primarily metabolized in the liver by CYP1A2 to yield 5-carboxypirfenidone, its inactive metabolite. 106 The mean terminal half-life is approximately 3 h in healthy volunteers, and the drug is excreted predominantly as 5-carboxypirfenidone in the urine (up to 80% of the dose). Pirfenidone increases hepatic enzyme levels, including aspartate and alanine transaminases and \u03b3-glutamyl transpeptidase, and is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 106 The FDA recently granted breakthrough therapy designation to Esbriet for unclassifiable interstitial lung disease (uILD). The Phase II trial was shown to slow disease progression and supported its efficacy on a number of lung function parameters, including forced vital capacity (FVC) in patients with uILD. 107 On the basis of the encouraging results seen in the treatment of both invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) and uILD, pirfenidone is being repurposed to treat patients with severe COVID-19 infection (NCT04282902). 108 This multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled Phase III clinical study will first assess the efficacy and safety of pirfenidone in 147 hospitalized adult patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and will be compared to the standard of care. Primary outcome measures include (1) absolute changes in baseline lesion area, finger pulse oxygen, and blood gas from baseline at 4 weeks of chest CT images and (2) total score of King's Interstitial Lung Disease Short Questionnaire (K-BILD) and week 4 absolute change from baseline. Secondary measures include time to death within 4 weeks due to respiratory causes and time to disease progression or death within 4 weeks in addition to multiple other pulmonary fibrosis survival measures. Pirfenidone was to be administered orally three times a day, two tablets each time, for a period of 4 weeks. The estimated primary completion date was April 30, 2020, and thus far the study data have not yet been reported. 19) .

An improved isolation process was developed by a team at Smith Kline French by neutralization of the reaction mixture to pH 6.5\u22127.0 and extraction into EtOAc at 60\u00b0C followed by crystallization from EtOAc. 110 This procedure was applied to the preparation of 8.2, which was isolated in 61% yield. 111 Conversion of 8.2 to pirfenidone was disclosed in 1974 by Affiliated Medical Research Inc. 112 The process involved reacting 8.2 with potassium carbonate and a catalytic amount of zinc-precipitated copper powder in refluxing iodobenzene (188\u00b0C) for 18 h. At the end of the reaction, benzene was added, and the mixture was decolorized with charcoal and then filtered and concentrated to an oil. The oil was titurated in petroleum ether to afford pirfenidone in 85% yield. 112 In the patent application from the innovator company, Intermune, pirfenidone was prepared from 8.2, bromobenzene (1.8 equiv), potassium carbonate (1.2 equiv), and cuprous oxide (5 mol %) in DMF (2 volumes) at 125\u00b0C for 18\u221220 h. After aqueous workup, pirfenidone was isolated in 85% yield after crystallization from toluene/heptane. The material was further purified by recrystallization from water (pH 11) to afford pirfenidone with the content of dimeric impurities less than 0.03% and the contents of all other impurities less than 0.05%. The inventors noted that the starting bromobenzene should be highly pure and contain very low levels of dibromo impurities since these form dimers that are difficult to remove. 113 Many other patent applications have been filed on the conversion of 8.2 to pirfenidone that include different conditions, stoichiometries, and other copper catalysts. Of note, Procos has developed a process using chlorobenzene as the solvent at 175\u00b0C, sodium carbonate, CuI, and the ligand N,N\u2032dimethylethylene-1,2-diamine. The product is isolated by crystallization from EtOAc/hexane followed by recrystallization from water in an overall yield of 72\u221284%. 114 8.3. Pirfenidone Final Form and Formulation. Pirfenidone exists as a single crystalline form designated as form A. 99 The drug substance is milled to less than 150 \u03bcm. 113 The drug product is formulated as an immediate-release hard capsule containing 266.7 mg of pirfenidone drug substance. The recommended daily dose is three capsules three times daily with food for a total of 2400 mg/day. 99 An 801 mg tablet is also available. 115 8.4. Outlook for Supply of Pirfenidone. Pirfenidone has orphan drug status in the U.S. and EU, suggesting that large supplies may not be available. Roche has not provided an update on the supply situation for expanded use in COVID-19 treatment.

History, Mechanism of Action, and Status of Clinical Trials. Baricitinib is a selective and reversible inhibitor of Janus-associated kinase 1 (JAK1) and 2 (JAK2). JAKs belong to the protein tyrosine kinase family and play important roles in the proinflammatory signaling pathways that are frequently overactivated in autoimmune disorders such as RA. 117 Upon binding of extracellular cytokines and growth factors, JAKs are phosphorylated and activate signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). Via these signaling cascades, inflammatory cytokine and chemokine transcription is induced to form inflammatory mediators, including IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, IL-15, and IL-23. The majority of viruses enter cells through receptormediated endocytosis. The receptor that SARS-CoV-2 uses to infect lung cells is ACE2, a cell-surface protein on multiple cells, including lung AT2 alveolar cells. AT2 cells are particularly prone to viral infection. 118 One of the regulators of endocytosis is the AP-2 associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1). Inhibiting AAK1 might interrupt the passage of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into cells and also the intracellular assembly of virus particles. 119 In addition to baricitinib's potent JAK1 and JAK2 activity, it also potently inhibits AAK1 and binds cyclin G-associated kinase, another regulator of endocytosis. 120 It is postulated that the therapeutic dose of 2 or 4 mg daily is sufficient to inhibit AAK1 and could be trialed in patients to treat COVID-19. The JAK1/2 activity may also inhibit the cytokine release associated with SARS-CoV-2 virus and dampen the cytokine storm that frequently manifests during Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS). 121 In humans, baricitinib is rapidly absorbed with an oral bioavailability of 79%. It takes approximately 1 h to reach peak plasma concentration. Baricitinib is metabolized by Cyp3A4, but <10% of the total dose is prone to this biotransformation. Baricitinib is excreted primarily as unchanged active drug in the urine (69%) and feces (15%), and only minor oxidative metabolites have been identified. The mean half-life in patients with RA is 12.5 h. 122 On May 8, 2020, NIAID announced that it is initiating a clinical trial to study baricitinib as a treatment for COVID-19 in combination with remdesivir. 123 The study is expected to enroll about 1000 hospitalized patients and will compare remdesivir alone with remdesivir plus baricitinib (4 mg oral daily). 123 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 278, "end": 281, "text": "116", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 637, "end": 640, "text": "117", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1239, "text": "118", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 1460, "end": 1463, "text": "119", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 1627, "end": 1630, "text": "120", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1976, "text": "121", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 2425, "end": 2428, "text": "122", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 2581, "end": 2584, "text": "123", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}, {"start": 2736, "end": 2739, "text": "123", "ref_id": "BIBREF106"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BARICITINIB"}, {"text": "The majority of clinical trials using baricitinib to date have been short duration (2 weeks) open-label trials to treat patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infection (Table 7) . 124 Furthermore, as baricitinib is primarily eliminated by renal excretion, clinicians are also combining it with antivirals such as lopinavir/ritonavir (NCT04320277). 9.2. Synthetic Routes to Baricitinib. Two main routes to baricitinib have been disclosed. The original route from Incyte involves coupling the lower and central fragments (disconnection B, Figure 6 ), followed by appending the upper portion (disconnection A). 125 Lilly has disclosed an alternate disconnection with initial coupling at point A followed by coupling at point B. 126,127 Both routes require the synthesis of fragment 9.1.

Oxidation of 9.4 was carried out with sodium hypochlorite, aqueous sodium bicarbonate, and catalytic amounts of KBr and 2,2,6,6tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl (TEMPO). After workup, the product layer was concentrated to dryness to provide crude ketone 9.5 in 97% yield. For the Horner\u2212Emmons reaction, the anion of diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate was generated with KOt-Bu in THF for 3 h at \u221210\u00b0C. Then ketone 9.5 was added, and the reaction mixture was stirred overnight at room temperature. After aqueous workup, 9.6 was isolated in 61% yield after purification by silica chromatography. A solution of 9.6 in MeCN was treated with 3 N aqueous HCl for 18 h at room temperature, and then concentrated to dryness. The resulting crude 9.7 was suspended in MeCN and then treated with diisopropylethylamine and ethanesulfonyl chloride at room temperature overnight. After aqueous workup, sulfonamide 9.1 was isolated after silica chromatography. Two reactions were described on a 1 kg scale for the final two steps under similar reaction conditions with yields of 59% and 91%. The Lilly approach to 9.1 involved three steps from unprotected azetidin-3-ol (9.8) and requires no protecting groups (Scheme 21). 126, 129 In the first step, 9.8 was reacted with EtSO 2 Cl in aqueous THF to generate sulfonamide 9.9, which was most efficiently isolated by continuous countercurrent extraction. In the first extraction using water/toluene, the product of reaction at both the amine and alcohol was extracted into the toluene layer, leaving product 9.9 in the water layer. This was then extracted with EtOAc to bring the product into the organic layer in a yield of 95% for the step. Oxidation to the ketone was described in both batch and flow modes. Batch processing using 6% oxygen in nitrogen (a concentration of oxygen that will not support combustion) with sodium nitrite, HOAc, and TEMPO in acetonitrile was carried out over 17 h at 500 psi, with the headspace being refreshed every minute. For the reaction in flow, the reactants and reagents were supplied in four feeds: (1) TEMPO in CH 3 CN, (2) NaNO 2 in water, (3) alcohol 9.9 in 1:6 HOAc/CH 3 CN, and (4) 6% O 2 in N 2 . The back pressure was set at 500 psi, and the residence time was 12 h, resulting in an assay yield of 98%. At the end of the reaction in either batch or flow, a batchwise aqueous workup was followed by a solvent switch into 2-PrOH to afford ketone 9.10 in a step yield of 87\u221294%. The advantages of the flow route include (1) no need for a specialized large-scale vessel rated to >500 psi, (2) no need for continuous replacement of oxygen in the headspace, and (3) improved safety considering the smaller footprint for the high-pressure reaction. Several other oxidation procedures were also described. The 2-PrOH solution of 9.10 was combined with diethyl cyanomethylphosphonate and diisopropylethylamine.

LOPINAVIR/RITONAVIR 11.1. History, Mechanism of Action, and Status of Clinical Trials. The treatment of HIV was revolutionized in the mid-1990s when a number of HIV protease inhibitors emerged, resulting in a dramatically reduced death rate for AIDS. 151 The chemical structures of these successful HIV protease inhibitors generally resemble small peptides and typically incorporate highly modified synthetic amino acids. 152, 153 The first HIV protease inhibitor to reach the market was saquinavir, which was developed by Hoffmann-La Roche and approved in December 1995. Ritonavir (RTV, 4.5) is a contemporary HIV protease inhibitor developed by Abbott Laboratories that received FDA approval in March 1996. Soon thereafter, Abbott Laboratories reported an improved second-generation HIV protease inhibitor, ABT-738, that later became known as lopinavir (LPV, 4.4). 154 As described in more detail below, dramatically improved bioavailability of lopinavir is observed in the presence of ritonavir. These findings led to the development of Kaltera, an FDA-approved fixed-dose combination of lopinavir and ritanovir for the treatment of HIV/AIDS in several countries, in which lopinavir is the predominant active drug and ritanovir functions primarily as a P450 CYP3A4 inhibitor. 155 LPV is an inhibitor of the enzyme HIV-1 protease, a dimeric aspartate protease that is responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein, which functions as the major structural protein of the virus and plays a vital role in the HIV viral life cycle. 156 LPV is a peptidomimetic drug containing a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the normal peptide linkage (cleaved by HIV protease) but cannot be cleaved. 151 Inhibition of HIV-1 protease activity and subsequent proteolysis of the Gag polyprotein results in the production of immature, noninfectious HIV-1 virus particles.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 541, "end": 544, "text": "150", "ref_id": "BIBREF131"}, {"start": 848, "end": 851, "text": "151", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1023, "text": "152,", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1024, "end": 1027, "text": "153", "ref_id": "BIBREF134"}, {"start": 1464, "end": 1467, "text": "154", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 1876, "end": 1879, "text": "155", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2126, "end": 2129, "text": "156", "ref_id": "BIBREF137"}, {"start": 2285, "end": 2288, "text": "151", "ref_id": "BIBREF132"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Formulations and Salt Forms of Camostat."}, {"text": "When administered alone, LPV has a very low human bioavailability of \u223c25%, primarily because of extensive oxidative metabolism by P450 CYP3A4 enzymes. 154 It is exclusively coadministered with RTV, which reduces drug metabolism and significantly improves the bioavailability of LPV. In healthy human volunteers, codosing of 400 mg of LPV and 50 mg of RTV significantly increases the area under the concentration curve (AUC) of LPV in plasma by 77-fold over that observed after dosing with LPV alone. This results in concentrations of LPV that exceed the antiviral EC 50 for >24 h. 154 To date, no in vitro SARS-CoV-2 data have been reported for lopinavir/ritonavir, but nonetheless, lopinavir was found to weakly inhibit both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV replication in 157 Most clinical studies have investigated the use of lopinavir/ ritonavir to treat SARS-CoV, but these studies have been mostly retrospective and observational in nature. 158 One such retrospective matched cohort study of SARS patients showed that treating SARS-CoV patients with LPV (400 mg)/RTV (100 mg) orally every day for 14 days significantly reduced ARDS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 151, "end": 154, "text": "154", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 581, "end": 584, "text": "154", "ref_id": "BIBREF135"}, {"start": 763, "end": 766, "text": "157", "ref_id": "BIBREF138"}, {"start": 936, "end": 939, "text": "158", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Formulations and Salt Forms of Camostat."}, {"text": "Patients also appeared to run a milder disease course in recurrence of fever, reduction of viral load, and worsening of chest radiographs. 159 It was also noted that the timing of administration was critical during the early viral replication phase (initial 7\u221210 days) because delaying therapy further had no effect on clinical outcomes. Initial reports of lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of COVID-19 involve small retrospective, nonrandomized cohort studies. A recent randomized, controlled open-label trial involving 199 hospitalized adults patients with SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan, China, compared the efficacies of lopinavir/ritonavir and the standard of care. 160 Treatment with lopinavir/ritonavir was not associated with a difference from the standard of care in the time to clinical improvement. In addition, mortality at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir/ritonavir group and the standard of care group (19.2% vs 25%), and the percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA were similar at various time points. 161 Further clinical trials are underway to assess both the efficacy and safety of lopinavir/ritonavir (Table 11) . 161 It has been reported that many clinicians are abandoning the use of lopinavir/ritonavir for the treatment of COVID-19 after the negative findings from the above study. A recent report sent to the editors of the New England Journal of Medicine suggests that this action is premature. The authors argued that the lowering of the mortality rate is significant, in addition to the lowering of ARDS. They advocated that therapeutic guidelines retain this combination as a treatment option against COVID-19, awaiting completion of the WHO Solidarity trial. 162a A recent report in The Lancet suggested that the combination of lopinavir, ritonavir, ribavirin, and interferon could be effective in treating COVID-19 in the early stages of the disease. 162b Patients were randomly assigned (2:1) to a 14 day combination of lopinavir (400 mg) and ritonavir (100 mg) every 12 h, ribavirin (400 mg) every 12 h, and three doses of 8 million IU of interferon beta-1b on alternate days (combination group) or to 14 days of lopinavir (400 mg) and ritonavir (100 mg) every 12 h (control group). Between February 10 and March 20, 2020, 127 patients were recruited; 86 were randomly assigned to the combination group and 41 to the control group.

The process chemistry route to 11.2, described on the 14\u2212122 kg of substrate scale, began with the tribenzylation of phenylalanine (11.4) with benzyl chloride to afford ester 11.5, which was isolated as a crude oil after aqueous workup. The next two steps, addition of the acetonitrile anion to the benzyl ester and reaction of the resulting nitrile with benzylmagnesium chloride, were carried out as a one-pot reaction in MTBE. Sodium amide was the base used to generate the acetonitrile anion. This is not a common base used at scale because of concerns with handling and flammability, but a survey of other bases, including KOH, KOtBu, NaH, KHMDS, and LiHMDS, led to incomplete reactions, slow conversions, or racemization. 167 MTBE was found to be a preferred solvent for the reaction, with no racemization occurring when the reaction was carried out at 0\u22125\u00b0C .

The use of a single reagent to effect reduction at both centers afforded mixtures of diastereomers. Sodium borohydride\u2212TFA complex provided the best result, with a 72% yield of the desired diastereomer 11. Reductions using NaBH 4 with mineral acids led to reduction of only the enamine double bond, generating 11.8 with a dr of approximately 95:5. This suggested that a stepwise process could be feasible: initial reduction of the enamine double bond followed by ketone reduction. The initial reduction using NaBH 4 with sulfuric acid followed by the ketone reduction by addition of NaBH 2 (TFA) 2 in THF afforded 11.2 with a dr of 95:5. While this reaction worked well in the laboratory, scale-up resulted in thick mixtures due to ring-opening polymerization of THF. Addition of water helped minimize THF decomposition and, unexpectedly, also improved the diastereoselectvity. However, a better solution was to exchange sulfuric acid with MeSO 3 H and carry out the reaction in the alternative solvent dimethoxyethane (DME). While water improved the selectivity, it also slowed the reaction, so the final conditions used 2-PrOH as an additive instead. The role of the alcohol in improving the diastereoselectivity remains unknown. The resistance of the keto nitrile to reduction was presumed to be due to complexation of the ketone, perhaps as a boron enolate. To enable the second reduction, a boron complexing agent was added. A survey of amino alcohols found triethanolamine to be optimal. The final conditions for the reduction of 11.8 to 11.2 were treatment of the solution of 11.7 in DME with triethanolamine, followed by addition of NaBH 4 in dimethylacetamide and stirring for 2 h at 15\u00b0C. Aqueous workup provided 11.2 as a solution in EtOAc containing the desired diastereomer in 89\u221293% yield, with the remainder being a mixture of the other diastereomers. 163\u2212165 This solution was used without further purification for downstream conversion to lopinavir (see Scheme 30) . The reduction process (11.7 to 11.2) was described on a 400 kg scale. 165 The Abbott synthesis of fragment 11.1 is outlined in Scheme 29. 163 In the first step, L-valine (11.9) was converted to carbonate 11.10 using phenyl chloroformate.

Control of the pH between 9.5 and 10.2 was critical to minimize the formation of valine dipeptide and acylated derivatives. Neutral alumina prevented gumming and emulsion formation, which was essential for mixing and maintaining pH control. After aqueous workup, carbonate 11.10 was isolated in 92% yield after crystallization from toluene/heptane. Treatment of 11.10 with 3-chloropropylamine hydrochloride and solid NaOH in THF at 10\u00b0C for 2 h furnished alkylated product 11.11, which was cyclized to obtain 11.1 by addition of KO-t-Bu in THF at 20\u00b0C.

Other solvates within type III were mentioned but not exemplified. 169 According to the EPAR for Kaletra, the commercial form is crystallized from EtOH and water and is a mixture of the amorphous form and crystalline type I. 170 A cyclohexane solvate of lopinavir and its desolvated form were subsequently disclosed by Hetero. 171 Two crystal forms of ritonavir, forms I and II, have been identified. 172 At the time of the initial approval of ritonavir (trade name Norvir) in 1996, only form I had been encountered in development and launch. Because of the low bioavailability of crystalline ritonavir, the two formulations that were marketed, an oral solution and a capsule, contained ritonavir as a solution in EtOH/water. In 1998, several lots of formulated drug undergoing release testing failed the dissolution specification. An investigation revealed that a new polymorph (designated as form II) was crystallizing in the capsules. Soon, the new polymorph showed up in other lots of formulated drug and the API. Form II was found to be the thermodynamically most stable form and is approximately 5-fold less soluble than form I in EtOH/water mixtures. This form was no longer fully soluble in the solution used for the capsule formulation nor under the refrigerated storage conditions for the oral solution. Therefore, both formulations of the product were withdrawn, and new formulations were investigated. A soft gelatin capsule formulation was developed with a solvent composition of EtOH, oleic acid, and water to ensure complete solubility of form II. Polyoxyl 35 castor oil was added to improve the bioavailability. 173 Subsequently, a film-coated tablet (100 mg) was developed and marketed. 174 The oral solution was reformulated in a mixed solvent system of water, EtOH, propylene glycol, and polyoxyl 35 castor oil. 173 Both ritonavir and lopinavir drug substances have very low water solubility, and the crystalline forms have minimal bioavailability. This led to an initial marketed formulation (U.S. approval September 2000) of a soft gelatin capsule containing 133.3 mg of lopinavir and 33.3 mg of ritonavir as a solution in a mixture of oleic acid, propylene glycol, and water, with a storage condition of 2\u22128\u00b0C. 170 To reduce the pill burden and avoid cold storage, a tablet formulation was subsequently developed using hot-melt extrusion technology to render each drug substance amorphous in the formulation. Film-coated tablets containing 200 mg of lopinavir and 50 mg of ritonavir were approved in the U.S. in October 2005 with roomtemperature storage conditions. 175 11.4.

On January 28, 2020, the Indian generic company Cipla announced that it has raw materials available to manufacture 10\u221212 million doses of lopinavir/ritonavir.

The treatment of HIV was revolutionized in the mid-1990s when a number of HIV protease inhibitors emerged, resulting in a dramatically reduced death rate for AIDS.151 The chemical structures of these successful HIV protease inhibitors generally resemble small peptides and typically incorporate highly modified synthetic amino acids.152,153 250 April 11, 2020/\nOctober 2020\n</td></tr><tr><td>145 tostaamCwith way ndersUial ical Trlin10.

Ritonavir (RTV, 4.5) is a contemporary HIV protease inhibitor developed by Abbott Laboratories that received FDA approval in March 1996. Soon thereafter, Abbott Laboratories reported an improved second-generation HIV protease inhibitor, ABT-738, that later became known as lopinavir (LPV, 4.4).154 As described in more detail below, dramatically improved bioavailability of lopinavir is observed in the presence of ritonavir. These findings led to the development of Kaltera, an FDA-approved fixed-dose combination of lopinavir and ritanovir for the treatment of HIV/AIDS in several countries, in which lopinavir is the predominant active drug and ritanovir functions primarily as a P450 CYP3A4 inhibitor.155\nLPV is an inhibitor of the enzyme HIV-1 protease, a dimeric aspartate protease that is responsible for cleaving the Gag polyprotein, which functions as the major structural protein of the virus and plays a vital role in the HIV viral life cycle.156 LPV is a peptidomimetic drug containing a hydroxyethylene scaffold that mimics the normal peptide linkage (cleaved by HIV protease) but cannot be cleaved.151 Inhibition ofHIV-1 protease activity and subsequent proteolysis of the Gag polyprotein results in the production of immature, noninfectious HIV-1 virus particles.\nWhen administered alone, LPV has a very low human bioavailability of\u223c25%, primarily because of extensive oxidative metabolism by P450 CYP3A4 enzymes.154 It is exclusively coadministered with RTV, which reduces drug metabolism and significantly improves the bioavailability of LPV. In healthy human volunteers, codosing of 400 mg of LPV and 50 mg of RTV significantly increases the area under the concentration curve (AUC) of LPV in plasma by 77-fold over that observed after dosing with LPV alone. This results in concentrations of LPV that exceed the antiviral EC50 for &gt;24 h.154\nTo date, no in vitro SARS-CoV-2 data have been reported for lopinavir/ritonavir, but nonetheless, lopinavir was found to weakly inhibit both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV replication in\nNCT04355053 An Open-Label Study to Compare the Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Hydroxychloroquine Combined\nwith Azithromycin Compared to Hydroxychloroquine Combined with Camostat Mesylate and to \"No\nTreatment\" in Hospitalized Patients Suffering from a Mild or Moderate SARS CoV 2 Virus\nhttps://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.oprd.0c00233\nOrg.
