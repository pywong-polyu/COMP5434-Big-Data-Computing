This work surveys the landscape of available and emerging biosensor technologies for COVID-19 testing. Molecular diagnostic assays based on quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are used in most clinical laboratories. However, the COVID-19 pandemic has overwhelmed testing capacity and motivated the development of fast point-of-care tests and the adoption of isothermal DNA amplification. Antigenic and serological rapid tests based on lateral-flow immunoassays suffer from low sensitivity. Advanced digital systems enhance performance at the expense of speed and the need for large equipment. Emerging technologies, including CRISPR gene-editing tools, benefit from high sensitivity and specificity of molecular diagnostics and the easy use of lateral-flow assays. DNA sequencing and sample pooling strategies are highlighted to bring out the full capacity of the available biosensor technologies and accelerate mass testing.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). [1] The outbreak was declared by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to be a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC). [2] Since December 2019, when it was first reported in Wuhan (China), COVID-19 has put more than a billion people in quarantine and has brought the economies of many countries to a halt. Governments responded with diverse strategies, informed on epidemiological models. [3] However, a lack of information on the real number of infected cases and the actual case fatality rate (CFR) has led to large uncertainties in quantifying and predicting the extent of this pandemic. [4] To obtain this key information, reliable diagnostics of COVID-19 for surveillance and tracking of new infections become essential. The development of tests for SARS took about six months. [5] With COVID-19, the short time it took from the detection of the first case (Nov. 2019) to the sequencing of the viral genome by Chinese scientists (11 Jan. 2020) [1] and the development of the first molecular assay (13 Jan. 2020) has been remarkable. [6] But testing in many countries is still minimal or rationalised, as the testing capacity is overwhelmed by the extent of the outbreak. This has led to significant variations in testing numbers per capita across countries. [7] Insufficient statistically well-designed testing prevents the accurate determination of the number of cases of infection and leads to a more than likely overestimate of the CFR. [8] CFR estimates are around 1.38 %, higher than the 0.1 % CFR of seasonal influenza. [9] Unreported infections (mostly asymptomatic or mild cases) increased the number of cases around the world [11] and expanded the pool of individuals who need screening. Testing and contact tracing have become essential in the process of loosening lockdowns. Countries with widespread testing and surveillance strategies like South Korea and Germany have been able to contain the spread. [12] The focus of this work is how to detect SARS-CoV-2 efficiently on a large scale and with high sensitivity. Figure 1 shows the diversity of diagnostic tools targeting biomarkers for COVID-19 at different stages of the disease. We distinguish three types of tests based on the biomarkers they address: genetic (targeting the viral genome), antigenic (targeting viral proteins) and serological (targeting antibodies against the virus). An in-depth analysis and comparison of their performance reveal the trade-offs between testing speed, sensitivity, specificity and ease of use. Technology innovations are in a race to provide high-performance devices for fast and scalable tests. Isothermal amplification methods, CRISPR-based diagnostics and next-generation sequencing adapted for COVID-19 testing are disrupting the molecular diagnostics landscape. This work identifies bottlenecks hindering widespread testing and presents solutions to make sensitive testing for COVID-19.",

National laboratories and companies around the world have developed different primers and probes addressing various regions of the viral genome.

[13] In contrast, the Charit\u00e9 protocol from Germany targets the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), E and N genes. [6] Every genetic testing protocol follows analogous steps, including sample preparation, RNA extraction, transcription of RNA into complementary DNA (cDNA), amplification of DNA and read-out.

            "text": "Sample collection: A swab is taken from the nose or throat of the potentially infected individual (Figure 2a ). There is evidence to suggest that the largest viral load is obtained from nasopharyngeal samples. [14] Sample collection requires clinical staff and follows a special biosafety procedure. New protocols and technologies are moving towards self-swab sample collection. Saliva samples also have diagnosis value, [15] and respiratory virus shedding in exhaled breath [16] makes breath condensate a potential specimen for diagnosis. [17] RNA extraction: The sample is first inactivated with a lysis buffer. RNA is then isolated and purified (Figure 2b) using fast spin-columns (e. g., QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit by QIAGEN), paramagnetic beads or phenol-guanidine isothiocyanate (GITC)based solutions. A shortage of commercial RNA extraction kits has motivated many laboratories to find in-house extraction methods: such as Trizol-based purification [18] and RNA precipitation with isopropanol. [19] At least four groups have shown that the RNA extraction step can be omitted, yielding results with minimal change in sensitivity. [20] Reverse transcription and amplification: Reverse transcription is a standard step that uses the enyzme reverse transcriptase to convert RNA into complementary DNA. Amplification is usually performed with PCR. The average processing time for thermal cycling is about 2 hours. Isothermal amplification (DNA replication at constant temperature) is an alternative to PCR that is gaining traction in many point-of-care diagnostics devices. Both PCR and isothermal amplification are discussed in the next sections.",

It requires a forward primer to start DNA synthesis, a backward primer and a fluorescent probe, together with reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase (responsible for DNA replication). In a single or twostep RT-PCR, RNA is converted first into complementary DNA (Figure 2c) , and then the DNA signal is amplified by a real-time polymerase chain reaction (a.k.a quantitative PCR). In real-time PCR, the probe strand (containing two dyes: a reporter and a quencher dye) binds to a specific target sequence to SARS-CoV-2 located between the forward and reverse primers ( Figure 2d ). During the extension phase of the PCR cycle, the polymerase degrades the bound probe, causing the reporter dye to separate from the quencher dye, resulting in an increased fluorescent signal. The fluorescence intensity is monitored at each amplification cycle. This fluorescence signal increases as more copies of DNA are produced, and if it crosses a certain threshold, set above expected background levels, the test result is positive. If the virus was not present in the sample, the fluorescence threshold is not reached, and the test result is then negative (Figure 2e ). The cycle threshold (Ct) is the number of PCR cycles required to achieve such a threshold (i. e., exceed the background level). Internal positive (samples known to contain SARS-CoV-2 RNA) and negative controls are run in parallel to confirm the validity of the result.",

The sensitivity is reported together with the limit of detection (LoD). The LoD sets the lowest concentration of SARS-CoV-2 RNA that can be detected by the RT-PCR test, which is determined by detecting the presence of the viral RNA in at least 95 % of the cases. For COVID-19 assays, the LoD can reach levels lower than 10 genome copies per reaction (0.5 cp/\u03bcL). [21] However, the sensitivity varies depending on the chosen kits and PCR instrument ( Table 1 ). Viral loads in the upper respiratory tract peak in the first week of symptoms. Failure to detect the virus in infected patients (false negatives) can be due to low sensitivity or other issues, such as laboratories working under pressure, or poor sample collection and preparation. It is yet unknown what types of specimens are optimal for detection with RT-PCR. A recent study from Wuhan suggests that nasopharyngeal swabs may offer greater consistency than other types of samples.

It bypasses the thermal cycling process in PCR, thereby shortening the test time and equipment cost significantly. Multiple isothermal amplification technologies have been developed, and some are already used for diagnosis of infectious diseases. [23] These methods include nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP), helicase dependent amplification (HDA), rolling circle amplification (RCA), nicking enzyme amplification reaction (NEAR) and strand displacement amplification (SDA). Among them, RT-LAMP has been adopted for COVID-19 diagnosis by several groups. [24] Circumventing the need for thermal cycling means that the use of isothermal amplification decreases the complexity of the diagnostic device and reduces its cost. The amplified DNA can be detected by changes in turbidity, by addition of intercalating dyes or by a pH-sensitive dye. [25] This simple read-out, the fast amplification and the possibility of multiplexing are the main merits of using isothermal amplification over PCR. The low cost and suitability for miniaturization of isothermal amplification methods will encourage a higher take-up of this technique for point-of-care molecular diagnostics. [26] The main challenges of methods like RT-LAMP are the difficulty of optimising reaction conditions and designing sequence-specific primers. But software tools can ease this problem. [27] The complexity of primer design and their multiplicity might lead to non-specific amplification. Therefore, a detection method to identify the amplified gene can be integrated to improve the performance. One promising solution involves using the highly specific CRISPR associated proteins Cas.",

            "text": "Sequencing of the viral genome helps identify and classify novel strains of coronavirus. [33] It is also an essential tool to find suitable primers for RT-PCR diagnostics and guide the search for therapies. [34] As the virus multiplies and spreads, random mutations accumulate in the genome at an approximate rate of two mutations per month (half the mutation rate of seasonal flu). These mutations can help track the spread of the virus in real-time and understand its phylogenetics, from which its transmission dynamics can be inferred. [35] Apart from surveillance testing, whole-genome sequencing can provide high-throughput diagnosis. [36] Several companies have repurposed sequencers-including next-generation sequencers (NGS) and Sanger sequencers-for COVID-19 diagnostics, following a similar workflow shown in Figure 4a . First, they lyse cells from the sample without extracting RNA, thereby saving reagents and reducing the number of steps. Spike-in RNA is added to co-amplify with any present viral RNA. The \"spike-in RNA'\"-with a 4 bp deletion-acts as control and reference for normalisation, to quantify the virus concentration (Figure 4b) . A PCR amplification step is performed, followed by NGS or Sanger sequencing. Using this method, BilliontoOne reports capacity to complete about 4000 tests per day with a single Sanger Instrument (30x faster than qPCR). [37] Figure 4. a) Workflow of whole-genome sequencing for COVID-19 diagnostics. The sample is collected, and reverse transcription and PCR amplification of a SARS-CoV-2 target region are performed without RNA extraction by direct addition to a one-step RT-PCR master mix, together with a synthetic spike-in strand. After co-amplification of spike-in and sample on a thermal cycler, the amplified products are sequenced, and the resulting chromatograms are analysed to determine if the sample contains viral RNA. b) A synthetic spike-in RNA with a 4 bp deletion is designed with sequence homology to the SARS-CoV-2 target so that it co-amplifies with the SARS-CoV-2 target. This enables quantification of relative abundances of spike-in and SARS-CoV-2 DNA from a Sanger sequencing chromatogram. Representative Sanger sequencing traces showing pure genomic sequence (top), pure spike-in sequence (middle), and sequencing from a mixture of genomic and spike-in sequences (bottom). When both spike-in and viral genomic sequence are present, the signals are used to estimate their relative abundances. Adapted with permission from ref. [37] . Copyright: 2020, the authors.",

It takes at least 5 days to acquire enough viral load to be detectable through antigenic tests and up to 7 days or longer to develop antibodies against the virus (Figure 1c) . The stage of the disease is a key parameter determining the choice of test. Figure 5 shows a typical lateral-flow immunoassay, together with the interpretation of its results. Antigenic test strips are coated with antibodies that bind to a viral protein. [38] Some prototypes use aptamers instead.

Although point-of-care lateral-flow immunoassays have been developed to diagnose COVID-19 within 15 minutes (Table 1) , the concentration of the analyte usually needs to be higher than 10 copies/\u03bcL. This means that most of these tests may only work in symptomatic individuals, although some tests might be capable of detecting infection at early stages. Some countries have rushed into large scale deployment of rapid tests, finding that the clinical sensitivities are lower than 30 %. The performance of rapid tests provided by manufacturers might vary from results in a routine testing laboratory. This is why clinical validation of rapid tests should be compared with a gold standard test in a large number target population before using them as a stand-alone diagnostic test. [45] Point-of-care molecular diagnostic assays can be compared against the RT-PCR standard, but the validation of antibody tests is more challenging. Viral proteins required for the assays are hard to procure, as well as patient blood samples with which to validate the assays. The Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics (FIND), in partnership with WHO, is conducting independent evaluations of molecular diagnostics and immunoassays to help generate performance data. [46] An evaluation of antibody testing for SARS-CoV-2 using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and lateral-flow immunoassays in the UK concluded that many commercial antibody rapid tests were not suitable for clinical use. [47] Even if the more accurate ELISA tests are done in centralised labs, it is not yet known whether seroprevalence implies immunity and whether all recovered patients still carry antibodies.",

[41] Recent research uses nanoparticles (carbon nanoparticles), luminescent nanoparticles (quantum dots, fluorescent quenching material), liposomes and enzymes.

No new technology is needed, but the necessary logistics to implement the pooling strategy, substituting the current individual testing. Representative RT-PCR scans of pooled samples yielded results below a cycling threshold of 40 (Figure 6b) . Such pooling methods, if scaled up appropriately, could lead to mass testing, make better use of current resources and quickly reject negative cases. Sample collection and RNA extraction represent further bottlenecks in testing capacity. By the omission of the RNA extraction step (~1 h) and adopting a medium-size pooling strategy (e. g., 5 samples per pool), RT-PCR testing could be sped up by one order of magnitude.",

CRISPR-based diagnosis represents a prime example where mixed technologies can lead, combining high specificity and sensitivity with efficient and low-cost biosensors. Direct quantification of viral RNA with CRISPR, without the need for DNA amplification, would reduce the sample-to-answer time significantly.

In a population-level study, even accurate tests can give high levels of false positives if the true prevalence is low. The choice of target populations and how tests are performed are important considerations. Mass screening representative samples of the population and contact tracing can guide public health authorities adapting their nonpharmaceutical interventions both in time and space, focusing the containment effort in affected communities and loosening lockdowns.
