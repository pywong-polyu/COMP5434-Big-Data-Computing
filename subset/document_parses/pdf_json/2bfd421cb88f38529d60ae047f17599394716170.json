Currently, 6 CAR T-cell products are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA): tisagenlecleucel (tisa-cel; Kymriah\u00ae), axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel; Yescarta\u00ae), brexucabtagene autoleucel (brex-cel; Tecartus\u00ae), lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel; Breyanzi\u00ae), idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel; Abecma\u00ae), and ciltacabtagene autoleucel (cilta-cel; Carvykti\u00ae).",

Consequently, models of CAR T-cell therapy evolved from clinical trials in which an inpatient setting was mandated for close monitoring and management of possible adverse events. Product acquisition costs and current reimbursement structures make inpatient cellular therapy administration challenging [6] . Outpatient administration is attractive as a primary model of cellular therapy administration [7] . Here, we share our experience in the development of an outpatient model for CAR T-Cell therapy and the results of our first 21 patients infused as outpatients with four different CAR T-cell products.",
