There seems to be a consensus in the literature that in-person interviews are the best ('gold standard') format [9] . However, they are not always possible due to logistical, practical, or safety reasons, such as the COVID-19 pandemic [10] [11] [12] . The COVID-19 pandemic has produced a wide range of changes in customary practices of conducting research, particularly on the gathering of data [13] . Researchers, ourselves included, have been forced to use remote methods, such as telephone interviews as a mean of collecting qualitative data. Although proven to be a viable way of data collection [14] , there is still a lack of methodological discussion about the use of telephone interviews for certain groups of participants [15] , such as persons with common mental disorders (CMDs) (i.e., depression, anxiety, adjustment disorders) or multimorbidity. These groups, with symptoms of e.g., exhaustion and bodily aches, have been difficult to recruit to research studies, due to mental distress, medications, stigma, and a reduced capacity to take on new information and thus to consent to participation, for example [16, 17] . Telephone interviews might be a well-suited solution for these groups [18] ; however, there are a lack of studies investigating the experiences of telephone interviews from the perspective of people with CMDs and multimorbidity.",

The most common concerns about telephone interviews are that they might have a negative impact on the richness and quality of the collected information [19] , the challenges in establishing rapport [21, 22] , and the inability to respond to visual and emotional cues [15] . Other criticisms involve the increased risk of misunderstandings and the inability to know if and when to ask probing questions or introduce more sensitive topics [20] . However, a growing body of literature using the telephone as a way of collecting data, as well as studies comparing the use of telephone with in-person interviews, do not find support for the traditionalist view. Rather, scholars make the case for the potential of in-depth telephone interviews as a viable and equivalent option for qualitative research [23] , with some even arguing that they are, in some regards, methodologically superior to in-person interviews [24, 25] .",

One study [14] found that in-person interviews are more conversational and detailed than remote methods (telephone and Skype), but that they do not clearly lead to differences in interview ratings. Other scholars [30] state that telephone offer flexibility regarding when and where to conduct the interview [24] , which increase anonymity and reduce distraction (for interviewees), thus improving the information given [26, 31] . Several attempts to develop tools improving the success of in-depth telephone interviewing have been made [32] [33] [34] [35] , considering the criticisms raised against telephone interviews, as well as the counter arguments. These tools provide a set of comprehensive approaches to follow before, during, and after the interview to ensure effective use. These emphasize the significance of communicating the importance of participant contribution, explaining the purpose of the study in the early phase of the research either in writing or initial telephone contact, and establishing rapport through small talk when first contacting the participant [32] . Because of the absence of non-verbal cues and difficulties in identifying visual emotional expressions, the importance of providing verbal feedback and follow up probes are stressed [36] , as well as using vocalizations and clarification to show responsiveness [32] . Such verbal cues or probed questions can in turn result in both parties listening more carefully [30] .",

Research has also shown that recent illness or present ill health affect research participation negatively, and using telephone interviews has been suggested as a way of enhancing response rate [18] . Including the experiences of people who are or have been on sick leave due to CMDs or multimorbidity in research is critical, due to, for example, the individual and societal burden. However, in doing so, the interview situation must be adapted to suit the participants needs. This may be provided by conducting telephone interviews.",

These features included words, sentences, or paragraphs relating to what the participants found difficult or easy with being interviewed over telephone, and were then condensed and assigned a code. The third step involved searching for possible themes, by identifying and coding them across participants. This step was performed on the first 22 interviews collected and refocused the analysis at the broader level of themes, rather than codes, and involved sorting the codes into potential themes and collating all the relevant coded data extracts within these themes. The first and second author made a first draft of the themes and the remaining researchers read through and discussed them. This discussion involved reviewing and refining themes, both with regard to each theme in itself and in relation to the data set. The ten remaining transcripts were analyzed based on the drafted themes and used to check for depth in the analysis. No new themes were added and the initial themes were adjusted until the conceptual depth in the themes was agreed upon [46] . A final step involved rechecking the data to code additional codes that may have been missed, before refining and defining the essence of each theme by naming them. During the analysis process, the coding and themes were repeatedly discussed by all the researchers until consensus was reached. During the analysis process, the first author translated the themes and quotes from Swedish into English and the second and the fourth authors reviewed the translations, before all the authors made a final revision.",

This suggests that telephone interviews can increase participation and, thus, the heterogeneity and breadth of the data. In particular, it seems to be crucial for being able to involve some of the most vulnerable groups, i.e., those with limited energy and an ability to participate in an in-person interview due to mental or physical illness. As such groups have been outlined as hard to recruit for research studies [16] , our results point to that telephone interviews might help overcome the challenges in interviewing people with for example CMDs and/or multimorbidity.

By removing the visible dimensions of social interaction, and giving participants the opportunity to be 'protected behind the phone', the emotion work is not completely removed from the interaction, but the conditions are changed because participants can maintain the desired anonymity and emotional distance. The telephone interview, compared with in-person interviews, allows interviewees to shed an unseen tear, lie down without anybody knowing, and keep visible emotions private.

They mentioned the importance of the interviewer's voice, both in relation to being able to understand the other and being understood. For example, participants described finding it easy to 'get a feeling' for the other person through the tone of voice instead of through the other social cues used when you are sitting face to face. As one of the participants explained, the way the interviewer spoke, referring to the tone of voice, helped to install confidence. Although verbalization has been stressed in telephone interviews [32] , our finding adds to research by stressing the importance of not only what is being said but also how it is said.

Using mobile phone can, therefore, involve more challenges regarding technology compared to using landline phone. Moreover, the participants choice of environment in some cases meant disturbances that challenged the researchers sense of being able to control the interview.

Whale [50] points to the loss of power for the researcher, in interviewing over Skype or telephone, as something that enables a more balanced power dynamic between the interviewer and the interviewee. Our findings show that using a mobile phone further expands the freedom for the participants, and inevitably means a redistribution of power from the researcher to the participants. At the same time, the interviewer controls most elements in the interview, such as the topics discussed [53] . The redistribution of power can, therefore, be both welcomed and challenging.",

This entails telling participants that they should preferably be able to talk freely without distraction, and that silence during the interview should be interpreted as active listening from an interviewer who does not want to disturb their stories. This introductory conversation is to prepare the participant for the particular form of dialog that a telephone interview is, but it also serves to establish rapport. In other words, it is a way of 'getting to know each other' without seeing each other, rather than clarifying the use of the voice as well as silences. This is important for building trust between the interviewee and the interviewer in line with the recommendation of, for example, Drabble et al. [32] . We also found that it was important for the interviewer to convey to the participant his or her understanding of the circumstances that are central to the subject of the interview-in our case, their health status and work disability. This suggests that the potential of the method is related to the interviewer being sufficiently familiar with the research topic and the specific kind of difficulties the participants are facing. This can be an important factor for validating the participant during the interview and building a trusting relationship over the telephone, as we were not able to do so using visual cues. As all participants used mobile phones, we found it necessary to encourage participants to choose a place where they have good reception and minimal background noise, especially important when using mobile phone compared to landline phone. This can prevent problems arising during the telephone interview and allay the researcher's own worries beforehand. The researcher too must choose a space with good reception and check that the recording equipment is working properly.",

Further, we found that asking participants about their experience of being interviewed over the telephone was a good way of ending the interview, which primarily was about their experiences of being on sick leave.

They provide more anonymity which seem to have a positive effect on self-disclosure and emotional display, while making fewer demands of participants in terms of emotion work and social responsibility. However, the shift from nonverbal to the audible put higher demands on the use of voice and require more intense listening on both parts. Worries about the quality of the interview due to difficulties with technology and sound or disturbances in the environment are also challenges presented as well as the loss of human encounter. Using telephone interviews as a means of qualitative data collection balance the power relationship between the interviewer and the interviewee, which can be demanding for the interviewer but beneficial for those being interviewed. The advantages, which were deemed as more important than the challenges, may give a certain group of individuals (e.g., those with CMDs or multimorbidity) a fairer opportunity to participate in research projects and share their experiences. Telephone interviews can be regarded as a valuable first option if the purpose of the study is not to build a relationship over time or observe visual cues, but rather about how people experience their lives.
