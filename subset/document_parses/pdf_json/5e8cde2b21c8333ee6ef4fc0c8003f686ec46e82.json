            "text": "Background: Web-based educational interventions are emerging as a potential solution to improve caregiver dementia knowledge and overall well-being. Objective: To assess the feasibility of delivering a web-based intervention for dementia caregivers by examining: 1) engagement with the online platform, 2) skill implementation, and 3) changes on outcome metrics over the 30-day study period. Methods: Enrolled participants were onboarded by a trained research coordinator and provided 24/7 access to the platform over 30 days. At study onset and completion, caregivers completed assessments of care recipient dementia severity and neuropsychiatric symptoms along with instruments which measured dementia knowledge, caregiver burden, and carer experience. Results: Of 84 referrals, 60 caregivers met study inclusion criteria and 55 completed pre and post study measures. Caregivers completed an average of 8 hours of learning over the 30-day web-based intervention, with 84.4% of participants reporting using at least one skill they learned from the online platform. Eighty-nine percent of participants reported high satisfaction with the web-based educational intervention. There were small effect sizes for decreases in NPIQ neuropsychiatric symptom severity and caregiver distress scores from pre-to post-intervention. Small effect sizes were observed for changes in caregiver burden from pre-to post-intervention among caregivers who perceived their care recipient as having high global deterioration. Conclusion: Findings show online educational programs are feasible for informal family caregivers of dementia and have perceived value. Future studies should address caregiver response to online education in less severe versus more severe care recipients, and explore the value of caregiver online platforms in diverse caregiver samples.",

In fact, 83% of older adults with dementia receive informal assistance from family members, friends, or other unpaid caregivers [2] . In addition to instrumental and basic activities of daily living, family members are often tasked with managing the behavioral symptoms of dementia, such as agitation, rejection/refusal of care, and apathy [2] . These behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD) are typically common throughout the disease trajectory and are especially challenging for both the person with dementia and their caregiver [3] .",

            "text": "Given the primary role family members play in providing care, the development of interventions to support the family caregivers are critical in the management of care for persons with dementia. Currently, there is no widely available solution that meets informal caregiver education needs to allow family caregivers to access and actively use the information that may be most useful to them at the time that they need it [4, 5] . Even in mild stages of cognitive impairment, educational interventions appear to be among the most important nonpharmacological interventions, not only to reduce caregiver anxiety and burden, but also to improve patient mood and quality of life [6, 7] . In a review of empirical studies addressing nonpharmacological interventions to decrease BPSD, Caspar and colleagues identified three mechanisms as necessary for sustained effective outcomes: the caring environment, care skill development and maintenance, and individualization of care [5] . The authors concluded nonpharmacological interventions should include consideration of both the physical and the social environment, as well as ongoing education and support for care providers. If family caregiver information needs are not met, then family members cannot provide effective care for a person with dementia [8] . Werner et al. also reported caregivers need information to be provided: 1) in a timely manner, 2) tailored to individual needs, and 3) in a usable fashion [9] . Interventions providing education and practical information have been shown to improve caregiver knowledge, decrease stress/workload, and empower caregivers within the healthcare system [10] [11] [12] .",

While most online interventions demonstrate some efficacy in adapting existing education programs into structured sessions/videos or via virtual facilitation of caregiver support groups, several studies have identified the need for more personalized education, with content specific to caregivers' unique care situation and preferences [9, 10, 15, 16] .",

Additionally, current literature on web-based interventions for dementia caregivers focuses disproportionally on the trial phase rather than the intervention making it increasingly difficult to understand the trajectory of online interventions [11] . Thus, there is a particular need for a centralized information hub that provides caregiver education materials that fulfill specific self-defined needs and can be implemented in practice.",

Twelve caregivers failed to follow-up with the study team after initial contact was made, six caregivers did not meet study inclusion criteria (i.e., screen fails), four caregivers declined to participate, and two caregivers missed the enrollment deadline. Fifty-five participants completed both pre-and poststudy measures (see Fig. 1 ). Descriptive statistics are displayed in Table 1 . Caregivers were mostly women (78%), spouses (49%) or children (32%), and white (75%). The majority of caregivers lived with the person they were caring for at the time of the study (72%). The age range of caregivers was 37 to 81 years and education was dominantly high school or greater. Caregivers most often reported the care recipient as having \"moderately severe cognitive decline\" (42%), followed by \"moderate cognitive decline\" (18%), \"severe cognitive decline\" (16%), \"mild cognitive decline\" (15%), \"very mild cognitive decline\" (7%), and \"very severe cognitive decline\" (2%). According to the NPIQ, caregivers listed memory and thinking problems as mild (26%), moderate (50%), or severe (24%). On the NPIQ, more than half of the participants reported observing problematic behaviors (agitation/aggression, anxiety, apathy, irritability/lability, nighttime behaviors, appetite/eating) with approximately a third of the sample reporting disinhibition, delusions, depression, disinhibition. Fewer than 10% reported observing hallucinations and elation/euphoria.",

For the entire sample, however, there were small effect sizes for decreases in NPIQ neuropsychiatric symptom severity and caregiver distress scores from pre-to postintervention. This finding provides preliminary evidence that a personalized, educational web-based training program may decrease perceptions of recipient neuropsychiatric severity and caregiver distress. When post hoc analyses were conducted separately based on perceived caregiver severity of recipient (i.e., low versus high global deterioration), a small effect size suggested caregivers who perceived his/her recipient as having high global deterioration had a lower post-training burden score relative to the pre-training score. Several studies have noted that caregiver burden increases with increasing severity of disease [29, 30] . Educational online training programs may therefore most assist with burden reduction for caregivers reporting higher burden and perceiving the recipient as more impaired. While we acknowledge that additional investigations with larger and more diverse samples are needed to confirm the clinical significance of our study findings, we interpret the general pre-post comparisons as evidence of potential value for personalized educational platforms.",

Second, online engagement was assessed for a limited period of 30 days, which is a limitation relative to programs ranging from 2 to 3 months, on average [35] . Based on the dementia knowledge scale completed prior to on-line boarding, the caregivers were also highly knowledgeable about dementia which may have biased study findings. Caregivers may have engaged with the platform more frequently knowing it was an expectation of the study, and may have over reported skill use and symptom improvement (e.g., Rosenthal effect) [36] . Third, caregivers' level of distress may be correlated with their perceptions of neuropsychiatric symptom severity, and therefore low/high perceived distressed may be result in less/more reporting of symptoms.
