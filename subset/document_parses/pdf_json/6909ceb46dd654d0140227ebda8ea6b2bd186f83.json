MAM analysis allows multiple relative quantifications of several structural attributes of therapeutic mAbs; however, some issues remain to be addressed in its procedures especially for sample preparation. The goal of this study was to optimize the sample preparation method for MAM analysis of mAbs. Using a model mAb, we compared five sample preparation methods based on sequence coverage, peptide redundancy, missed cleavage and chemical deamidation. It was found that low pH buffer and short digestion time reduced artificial deamidation. The desalting process after carboxymethylation was essential to obtaining high sequence coverage by a short digestion time. The generation of missed cleavage peptides was also improved by using a trypsin/lysyl endopeptidase (Lys-C) mixture. Next, we evaluated the usefulness of our method as a part of MAM analysis. Finally, 17 glycopeptides, 2 deamidated peptides and N-and C-terminal peptides of the heavy chain were successfully monitored with acceptable mass accuracy and coefficient of variation (CV, %) of the relative peak area. On the other hand, 4 oxidated peptides indicated the unavoidable slightly higher inter-assay CV (%) of the peak area ratio due to the instability in the MS sample solution. Collectively, we demonstrated that our method was applicable as an easy and reliable sample preparation method for MAM analysis, and the variation in the relative peak area could be influenced by the modification type rather than by the amount of each peptide.",

As of 2019, more than 60 therapeutic mAbs have already been approved in the United States, the European Union, and Japan [1] . Novel modalities that include therapeutic mAbs related to SARS-CoV2 and biosimilars related to mAbs are being actively developed, and the development of mAbs is expected to continue in the future [2] [3] [4] [5] . In the development of therapeutic mAbs, it is essential to characterize the structural aspects because certain structural characteristics are strongly associated with safety and efficacy. However, the rapid structural characterization of mAbs has been continuously challenging due to their excessive structural complexity. Currently, a panel of physicochemical and biological methods has been used to evaluate the quality attributes of mAbs [6] . The conventional methods include high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), sodium dodecyl sulfatepolyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), capillary gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS). Most of these conventional methods usually only indirectly monitor one of the characteristics of mAbs, and therefore, it is costly and time consuming to perform a comprehensive characterization of mAbs.",

            "text": "The multi-attribute method (MAM) approach is based on mass spectrometric peptide mapping and has garnered attention as a new and alternative method based on conventional methods. In MAM, the analyte, i.e., a therapeutic protein, is first digested into peptides, and the sample is prepared for peptide mapping. The enzymatic digests are analyzed by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS/MS) using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) and high-resolution and accurate mass spectrometry (HRMS). Then, the mass spectrometric data are applied to a database search analysis using peptide mapping software (Figure 1 , characterization step), and the resulting data are used to create a processing method for monitoring the MAM target peptides. In this step, it is important that the target peptides are selected in accordance with the quality control strategy of each drug, and most of the actual target peptides would be mainly peptides with several post-translational modifications (PTMs), including the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region-glycosylation, deamidation, isomerization, oxidation, glycation, N-terminal pyroglutamination, and C-terminal Lys cleavage. Data for MAM monitoring are acquired by a full mass scan using only UHPLC/HRMS, and finally, the relative quantification of target peptides is performed by using software for MAM (Figure 1 , monitoring step). If unknown peaks are detected, then the peaks can be further analyzed for identification by LC/MS/MS. The relative amount of each peptide is usually estimated based on the peak area intensity. Recently, several MAM workflows have been provided by MS and software vendors and have gradually been used by Chemistry, Manufacturing and Control (CMC) employees [7] . Previously, Rogers et al. demonstrated that an MAM approach using an Orbitrap-type mass spectrometer and software for identification and quantification has the potential to replace partial conventional chromatographic and electrophoretic methods currently used in the quality control of therapeutic mAbs [8] . Bomans et al. showed an MAM approach that combines high-throughput sample preparation and LC/ MS using a Q-TOF-type mass spectrometer and applied this approach to monitor Fc-glycosylation, oxidation, deamidation, isomerization and glycation [9] . Furthermore, a regulatory agency has also a keen interest in the quality control of protein therapeutics by MAM [10] . MAM can provide detailed qualitative and quantitative information about the structural characteristics of mAbs and may enable the improved productivity and the reduced risk and cost of the development stage. Therefore, MAM might be useful as an alternative method to some conventional methods such as glycosylation profiling and evaluating charge variants.",

These steps were the same as the reference method; however, the denaturation buffer volume in Method 1 was only 150 \u03bcl, whereas that of the reference method was 500 \u03bcl.

In addition, the enzyme concentration during digestion of Method 1 was ten times that of the reference method. We thought that these changes contributed to reducing the redundancy of peptides (peptide redundancy) observed in the peptide mapping. Next, we compared Method 1 with four different methods: a traditional method (Method 2), a commercial kit for proteomics (Method 3), and two commercial kits for peptide mapping (Methods 4 and 5). The method utilities were evaluated by the scores based on four performance metrics: (i) sequence coverage, (ii) peptide redundancy, (iii) zero-missed (undigested) cleavage ratio and (iv) deamidation level on Asn55 in the IYPTN 55 GYTR peptide from the heavy chain (H-chain). The calculation methods of each parameter are described in the Materials and Methods section. Higher sequence coverage is important to enable comprehensive monitoring. Lower peptide redundancy and a higher zero-missed cleavage ratio in the peptide map are important to simplify the selection of monitoring peptides because it is methodologically not easy to monitor multiple peptides for a certain modification. The deamidation level of Asn55 in the H-chain is also evaluated as a model of artificial modifications during sample preparation because it is well known that the Asn in the Asn-Gly sequence is prone to deamidation [13, 14] (Figure 2 ). Because Asn55 is in the complementarity determining region (CDR) of trastuzumab, where the deamidation level needs to be controlled, this peptide can also be a model that is measured by MAM during the quality control of mAb products. The scores are summarized in Table 2 . The weights of scores were set to 10:8:3:10 against (i):(ii):(iii):(iv) by considering the impact on the comprehensiveness, ease and reliability of the relative quantification.

The highest sequence coverage was observed in the digestion time of 30 min (H-chain, 96.9%; light chain, 100%), which was digested by trypsin only at pH 7.5. The reason why a shorter digestion time was better in this result may be that short peptides, which were generated by the complete digestion, were undetectable in peptide mapping. Interestingly, the treatment by Method 3 indicated that the sequence coverage increased over time, which contrasts with that of the treatment by Method 1, suggesting a slow digestion speed in Method 3.

The average relative peak area of glycopeptides having three major glycans, A2G0F, A2G1F and A2G2F, was 39.46% (CV, 0.26%), 32.87% (CV, 0.41%) and 5.01% (CV, 1.12%), respectively, which agrees with a previous report [15] . Minor components, such as M6 and A1G1M5 (hybrid-type glycan), were also detected successfully. Surprisingly, the inter-assay CV (%) of all monitored glycopeptides was <7%. This result implied that our method was applicable for monitoring even a small amount of modified peptides including glycopeptides. The relative peak area percentages of all modified peptides are summarized in Table 5 Table 1 were also evaluated; however, remarkable differences were not observed. Given that a single lot of trastuzumab was used in this study, artificial oxidation may have occurred during the desalting of tryptic digests or during sample vial storage. To address the cause, the long-term stability of the peptides in an acidic solution related to chemical modifications was evaluated by analyzing two degraded samples. The first sample was stored in 0.1% FA solution at 37\u00b0C for 10 days and then additionally stored at 8\u00b0C for 30 days in the dark. The second sample was stored in 0.1% FA solution at 8\u00b0C for 40 days in the dark. As shown in Table S4 , the oxidated peptides were increased in both samples. It was indicated that the instability in an acidic solution such as the LC/MS sample solution containing FA may be related to the higher CV (%) values of oxidated peptides. Additionally, the N-terminal pyroglutamated peptide was increased in degraded sample-1, indicating that heat stress influenced the formation of pyroglutamine. These results implied the importance of possible rapid analysis and storage of digested peptides at a low temperature.",

            "text": "To reduce the redundancy, in other words, improving the digestion efficacy, digestion by a combination of trypsin and Lys-C was critical. More practically, the peptide redundancy when using trypsin/Lys-C (3:1) was half the peptide redundancy than that when using trypsin only. What is more notable was that high sequence coverage was successfully achieved by short digestion times of only 30 min. This result is consistent with the findings of a previous report [12] . In usual peptide mapping, the reaction mixture after reduction and carboxymethylation (RCM) is often diluted to maintain enzymatic activities in the digestion process; however, some RCM buffer reagents could delay the digestion by inhibiting enzyme activities. We thought that desalting after RCM may be an essential procedure for short-term digestion. It is known that one of the most susceptible artificial modifications during peptide mapping is deamidation [14] . In the peptide mapping of trastuzumab, the most susceptible deamidation site was at Asn55 in the H-chain. Surprisingly, the deamidation level was less than 1.0% by using Method 1 (proposed method) with the digestion buffer at pH 7.5. It was demonstrated that the proposed method enables MAM analysis without The relative peak area (%) was calculated as the ratio of each glycopeptide against the total peak area, including unglycosylated peptide and all glycosylated peptides. Green circle, mannose; blue square, N-acetylglucosamine; yellow circle, galactose; red triangle, fucose; purple diamond, N-acetylneuraminic acid. In this study, we demonstrated that MAM analysis of the 25 modified peptides from trastuzumab was possible. Importantly, we noticed that the inter-assay CV (%) values of the peptides with an oxidated Met were clearly higher than those of other peptides, but the intra-assay CV (%) values were acceptable. A long-term stability test revealed that the higher CV (%) values of oxidated peptides might be caused by the instability in acidic solution. Considering that acidic solutions containing FA or trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) are used as general MS sample solutions, it might be difficult to improve the CV (%) value of oxidated peptides, while it could be important to evaluate the usefulness of antioxidants. Therefore, this result indicated that variations in the relative peak area could be influenced by the modification type, rather than by the amount of each peptide. Optionally, the assessment of stressed samples prepared under several conditions such as heat and pH variations may be useful for identifying susceptible chemical modification sites and selecting peptides to be considered as monitoring peptides.",

The performance metrics and their criteria for system check should be selected for the purpose of MAM monitoring each modified peptide. Our analytical performance evaluation method may also be able to be used for assessments of system suitability and sample suitability for the implementation of MAM analyses during quality control. mAbs undergo several modifications during manufacturing or storage. Previous studies have reported that certain components of Fc-glycans are involved in structural fluctuations and immune effector functions, such as antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity and complement-dependent cytotoxicity [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, it could be important to monitor glycopeptides to ensure the safety and efficacy of mAb products. Other modifications are also related to mAb efficacy. For example, deamidation in CDR causes a significant reduction in the antigen binding affinity [19] . Oxidation of Met and Trp also result in reduced binding affinity to antigens and Fc receptors [20] [21] [22] . In addition, chemical modifications can potentially increase in immunogenicity [23] . These reports indicate the importance of site-specific modification monitoring. We demonstrated that the monitoring of multiple deamidated or oxidized peptides is easily, reliably and simultaneously achieved by using the proposed method. Isomerization and glycation also impact biological functions [24] [25] [26] ; therefore, these modifications can also become monitoring candidates. However, it is difficult to identify them. For example, particular MS/MS measurements such as electron transfer dissociation (ETD)-MS/MS analysis are needed for the structural determination of isoaspartic acid (isoAsp) in peptides because ETD-MS/MS generates the diagnostic fragment ion of isoAsp [27, 28] . The glycation site is mainly Lys, and glycation can inhibit digestion using trypsin [26] . We think that the reliable and robust monitoring of peptides with both modifications is a future task.",
