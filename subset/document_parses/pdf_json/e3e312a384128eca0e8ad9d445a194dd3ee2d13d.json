All of these COVID-19 patients were transferred to the Affiliated Infectious Disease Hospital of Soochow University. Severe COVID-19 cases met one of the following criteria: (a) respiratory distress, respiratory rate \u226530 bpm; (b) oxygen saturation \u226493%; (c) arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO 2 )/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) <300 mm Hg; The underlying chronic diseases included three hypertension cases, three diabetes cases, one chronic obstructive pulmonary disease case, and one stroke case. Most of the COVID-19 patients had a fever (36 cases, 90%) and cough (27 cases, 67.5%), which was in agreement with early reports from Wuhan. 3 The average values for respiratory rate, peripheral oxygen saturation, heart rate, and mean blood pressure were 19.10 \u00b1 1.66 bpm, 98.28 \u00b1 1.63%, 90.60 \u00b1 12.45 bpm, and 95.37 \u00b1 8.37 mm Hg, respectively.",

A total of 18 cases of lymphopenia, nine cases of neutropenia, eight cases of thrombocytopenia, and seven cases of anemia were observed. Lymphopenia was the most common. In the present study, white blood cell differential count results indicated that only neutrophil numbers showed statistical differences between the mild/moderate and severe groups (P = .047). A recent report on pathological autopsy cases confirmed the presence of hematological changes in COVID-19 patients. 4 Clinical application of neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and lymphocyte-monocyte ratio (LMR) has been receiving increased attention. One meta-analysis suggested that peripheral blood leukocyte ratios were useful biomarkers for the diagnosis of bacteremia and influenza virus infection. 5 Qin et al found that monitoring of NLR and lymphocyte subsets may be helpful for early warning, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19. 6 However, normal reference ranges for NLR, PLR, and LMR remain elusive.",

The mean for LMR was significantly lower than donor reference control (5.03 \u00b1 1.64). Based on the calculated reference range, 11 patients had elevated NLR (including five severe cases), 12 had elevated PLR (five severe cases), and 26 had reduced LMR (eight severe cases). By comparing the two groups of COVID-19 patients, it was determined that NLR and LMR differences were statistically significant between mild/moderate and severe cases. NLR was higher, while LMR was lower in severe cases. Compared with single neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counting, NLR and LMR seemed to have a better performance in prediction and severity stratification of COVID-19.",

The study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, and written consent was obtained from all the patients and healthy donors. The epidemiological and clinical history was collected at the fever clinics, and every patient underwent vital sign measurements. Pharyngeal swabs were sampled and sent to Suzhou Center for Disease Control for RT-PCR detection. Basic laboratory examinations in the fever clinics included complete blood count, coagulation panel, and optional test for inflammatory factors. A standard case questionnaire was used for data collection. The statistical software spss 22.0 for Windows (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA) was used for data analysis. Continuous variables were described as mean \u00b1 standard deviation or median (range), while categorical variables were expressed as frequencies (%). Mann-Whitney tests were used to compare the differences between the two COVID-19 groups. A total of 40 COVID-19 patients were enrolled with an average age of 47.7 \u00b1 13.4 years, including 26 males and 14 females. The patients were classified into 31 mild/moderate cases and nine severe cases. Among them, 30 cases had travel or residence history in epidemic areas (mainly Hubei Province) within 14 days before the onset of illness and three cases had contact history with COVID-19 patients. Sixteen COVID-19 cases presented with family clustering. The median time from symptom onset to diagnosis was 5.2 \u00b1 3.2 days.",

However, no statistical difference in fibrinogen and D-dimer levels was found between the two groups. Studies have confirmed that D-dimer levels were significantly increased in severe COVID-19 patients admitted to the ICU.7,8 Specifically, D-dimer levels greater than 1000 \u03bcg/L could help clinicians to identify patients with poor prognosis at an early stage.9 Only 11 patients were tested for inflammatory factors and all patients had a negative procalcitonin level (0.05 \u00b1 0.03 ng/ mL), while eight patients had elevated C-reactive protein levels, with the mean (range) of 14.67 (2.95-60.83) mg/L. C-reactive protein can be routinely tested in most fever clinics, and procalcitonin might be helpful in excluding complicated bacterial pneumonia.In summary, COVID-19 patients diagnosed in the fever clinics were mainly exported cases. For COVID-19 patients in the fever clinics, abnormal changes in hematological index were common. Lymphopenia and elevated levels of fibrinogen, D-dimer, and C-reactive protein were observed. Compared with mild/moderate COVID-19 cases, severe cases had a higher NLR and absolute neutrophil count and a lower LMR. Clinical application for conventional hematological indexes should be fully explored in the fever clinic in the future.",
