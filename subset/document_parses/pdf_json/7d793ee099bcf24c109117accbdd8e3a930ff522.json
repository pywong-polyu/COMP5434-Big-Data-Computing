We present two cases of rubber band syndrome (Dhaga syndrome) who presented with painful, swollen, complete claw hand. Until 2019, only 15 cases were reported with predominance of Indian children. MRI is the gold standard investigation where a high degree of clinical suspicion is diagnostic. Surgical exploration with removal of the constricting band and excision of neuroma in continuity of ulnar and median nerves for preventing neurological deficit and tenolysis of tendons depending on the depth of the band is unambiguous treatment of choice. Where history is not forthcoming, a circumferential scar on the wrist of a child demands exploration.",

None yet has required a nerve or vascular repair according to the literature search [7] . Arora A et al. describe a case of 18-month-old girl, diagnosed and treated for tuberculous infection.
