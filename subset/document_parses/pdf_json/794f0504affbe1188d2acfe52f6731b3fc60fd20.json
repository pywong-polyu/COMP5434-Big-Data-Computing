In a matter of weeks after detecting the outbreak, the virus was isolated, its genome sequenced and published (9) and made available for research. Slightly less than a year later multiple vaccines were already being deployed to combat the virus. This would have been unimaginable just 10 years ago. Although this is an extreme example arising out of an extreme situation, it is to be expected that with the commoditization of synthetic DNA and the wider availability of powerful gene editing tools (10) , the number of engineered strains will rapidly increase. Indeed, cheaper DNA synthesis technology and the development of high throughput, automated, cloning processes allows the creation of large plasmid and combinatorial dna libraries (11, 12) in a matter of days, including the modification of recalcitrant species' genomes (13) , which previously were difficult to edit.",

            "text": "And yet, while engineering biology has changed profoundly in the last few years, there are still deep gaps in the way the process of strain engineering is done and disseminated. For example, engineering a \"synthetic biology agent\" (14) produces large quantities of information: published articles, protocols, notebooks, models, databases, sequencing and other types of data (e.g. metabolomics, proteomics, lipidomics, etc). Combined, all these information sources, may add-up to terabytes of data but only a relative small percentage of it is being made available when results are published in specialized outlets. This gap in scientific practice has led to an on-going crisis in cell line misidentification (15, 16, 17) , a recognized lack of reproducibility (18) , sometimes causing high profile retractions (19) and often resulting in weakening public attitudes to new and emerging technologies. Public attitudes towards science in general, and in particular newly emerging technologies such as engineering biology, have been the focus of study over the last few decades. Some of the earlier studies were based on the so called 'deficit model' that assumes that publics' support of science and novel technologies is built on their knowledge of science. Although this model is still used by some scientists, surveys and polls have shown that more knowledge of science (or technology) does not necessarily lead to more public support (20, 21) . It was also shown that deference to science (22) had a large impact on perceptions of, e.g., nanotechnology, and that public trust in the claims made by experts or by scientific institutions (23, 24) is an important factor in understanding publics' attitudes to science. Version Control: the practice of tracking changes in the source code of computer programs, which is assisted by the use of special software that keeps track of the code, its changes over time, the changes' authors and other metadata.",

We also carried out stability evaluation of the barcodes. We studied the effects on the strains of both barcode presence and insertion procedures. To do so growth profiles comparisons (fig. S5) and WGS experiments (Tables S7-S12) were carried out. Both experiments suggest that barcoding has no effect on the signed strains. Additionally, the stability of the barcode sequences was assessed under five different growth conditions. The barcodes were stable both in terms of presence (Table S13 ) and sequence integrity after the long-term experiments ( fig. S6-S35) .

In the future, other kingdoms of life will also be added to CellRepo and tested in similar ways.",

Workflow for barcoding any microorganism or strain of interest. The roadmap can be applied to basically any biological system amenable to genomic insertions of short DNA sequences. Once a specific barcode is committed, it is synthesized and delivered to a stable region of the genome of the target organism. The different approaches followed in this study to select appropriate barcoding locations are described in the Supplementary Material. This can be made with a whole collection of genetic tools available to this end in a fashion dependent or independent on homologous recombination. As the resulting insertion is expected not to generate a conspicuous phenotype, proper delivery of the barcode to the expected genomic site is secured and selected with CRISPR/Cas9 technology or via the more traditional antibiotic resistance or auxotrophic marker approach depending on the laboratory carrying out the barcoding.",

Using these lists, it was possible to create a simple python script to get possible candidates of essential gene pairs. The script used as input the GFF3 annotation file of the strain and the essential gene list. Both files had to be curated to obtain the same gene nomenclature in both files. As output, the algorithm gives back a pair of essential genes next to each other, the orientation of both genes and the DNA sequence that separates them. Then, databases (42) and prediction tools (43, 44) were used to check for the presence of regulatory elements in the intergenic sequence not shown in the annotation files.

For this reason, well-known generally-conserved essential genes were taken into consideration to choose one possible insertion locus for the barcode. GlmS gene was chosen as a good candidate as it is a broad-host conserved gene in many species and it has a long enough intergenic region for the insertion of Ll.LtrB intron carrying barcodes. The procedure to select the exact insertion site inside the intergenic region downstream of glmS was adapted from (49). In general, the PP5408-glmS intergenic region was surveyed for good Ll.LtrB intron insertion sites in the Clostron.com website. Obviously, the sequences needed for tn7 insertion were avoided as we did not want to hinder the possibility of using this insertion method before or after the barcoding procedure. From the retrieved list of insertion loci, one was chosen from previous data verifying the correct insertion of Ll.LtrB in this site (50). Similarly, to P. putida, no essential gene information was found for S. albidoflavus (previously known as Streptomyces albus). However, in this case we wanted to follow a different approach to showcase the flexibility of the proposed system for new candidate species to be barcoded. A close relative, Streptomyces coelicolor, is the model species for the study of the Streptomyces genus. For this species, there is a genome-scale metabolic model with gene essentiality data available that can be applied to other Streptomycetes (51). Using this model, just reactions catalysed by a known S. coelicolor gene, essential for all conditions tested and with no isoenzymes were considered. Using this data, it was possible to create a list of putative essential genes (Table S1 ) for S. albidoflavus by aligning each of the S. coelicolor A3(2) essential genes to S. albidoflavus J1074 database.",

To transform this vector into S. albidoflavus J1074, the protocol detailed in (66) was followed. pCRISPomyces-2 was a gift from Huimin Zhao (Addgene plasmid # 61737).",

In eukaryotes, CRISPR-caused double strand breaks (DSB) can be repaired by Non-Homologous End Joining (NHEJ) or Homologous Recombination (HR) in the presence of a repair template. NHEJ repair is usually imprecise and indels occur. In the case of S. cerevisiae however, it has been observed that NHEJ hugely decreases the cell survival and, when a repair template is provided, HR is the prevalent repair mechanism in this species (76) . Prokaryotes usually lack NHEJ repair mechanisms. Nevertheless, it has been described in Streptomyces coelicolor among other bacterial species. In this Actinobacteria, closely related to S. albidoflavus, researches knocked-out genes using CRISPR without providing a repair template and allowing the native NHEJ system to -wrongly -repair the DSB (77) . It may be possible that the gRNAs caused CRISPR offtarget activity that was repaired by NHEJ causing mutations to appear. Together with the fact that the genome of S. albidoflavus has a high GC content and produced the worst sequencing quality of the analysed species, this may explain the higher mutation count. Even though other mechanisms may explain the observed variation (see next), users wanting to use pSA-CRISPR-gRNA2 should bear in mind these extra mutations.",
