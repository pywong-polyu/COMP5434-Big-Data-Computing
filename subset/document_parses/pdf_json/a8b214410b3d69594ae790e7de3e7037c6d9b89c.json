            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused a global pandemic and exerted a profound physiological and mental impact on the public. Due to anxiety from being bombarded by information from the news and social media, people may constantly read and repost, with a fear of missing out (FOMO), information about COVID-19 on social media. So far, there has been little research on COVID-19 FOMO. We therefore compiled the COVID-19 information fear of missing out scale (CIFS) and administered it to 1178 adults in Taiwan to identify the possible factors influencing CIFS scores. We demonstrated that the CIFS had good reliability, factor validity, and criterion validity. With regard to demographic variables, we found that gender, marital status, travel time to the nearest hospital, and educational background influenced CIFS scores. In contrast, the participant age and whether he or she lived in an urban area did not affect the CIFS scores. With regard to social media usage, social media usage time (r = 0.025) and the numbers of COVID-19-related posts read on social media (r = 0.117) or instant messaging (r = 0.169) were not highly correlated with CIFS scores. Rather, CIFS scores were found to be significantly correlated to the frequency of reposting COVID-19-related information on social media (r = 0.497) and on instant messaging (r = 0.447). These results indicate that CIFS scores are closely associated not with passive browsing on social media but with the frequency at which an individual actively reposts information. In other words, what creates CIF is not an overabundance of information (i.e., an infodemic) but the active reposting and interpretation of information. Individual autonomy for interpretation of the received information and self-determination about reposting are key factors for COVID-19 information FOMO. When facing the COVID-19-related news on social media, it is the active information-related FOMO, not the passive infodemic, that influences our social media usage.",

Due to social media, the impact and speed of information dissemination regarding COVID-19 are vastly different from those during pandemics in previous centuries. The WHO even coined a new term, \"infodemic\", defined as \"an overabundance of information-some accurate and some not-that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it\" [3] . An infodemic refers to excessive information spreading as rapidly as an epidemic and causing anxiety and panic.

The convenience of social media enables people to continuously search for relevant news and repost information on social media or instant messaging mobile apps in hopes of getting a grasp on information on COVID-19 and reducing their own risk of infection. However, instead, the constant use of social media is causing a fear of missing out (FOMO). This study proposed a novel latent construct: COVID-19 information FOMO (CIF), which is the anxiety that an individual feels about control over information as COVID-19 spreads. This FOMO. with regard to important information, is similar to conventional socially related FOMO: a worried feeling that you may miss some events that other people are going to, especially caused by things you see on social media [4] .",

This study focuses on the anxiety that individuals have regarding their control over information on COVID-19 on the internet. We therefore defined CIF as \"a pervasive anxiety caused by the FOMO on any disease-related information and the display of a continuing need to maintain control over disease-related information\". Socially related FOMO cites the self-determination theory (SDT) [7] to explain the cause of FOMO. According to the SDT, effective self-regulation and psychological health are based on the satisfaction of three basic psychological needs: competence, autonomy, and connectedness with others. When said needs of an individual are not met, he or she may turn to social media because social media is a resource for getting in touch with others, a tool to develop social competence, and an opportunity to deepen social ties. We similarly used the SDT to explain CIF, in which individuals used social media to obtain the latest epidemiological information and maintain their own competence and autonomy. They also use social media to keep in touch with others, which includes reposting the latest information provided by other people.",

This study found that an individual living in an urban area did not affect his or her CIFS score. Rather, what really influenced the CIFS score was how far the nearest hospital was. This may involve how long it would take to get to the hospital in the event of an emergency and may be associated with the residential patterns and health insurance system in Taiwan. Taiwan is small and densely populated, and in even in some non-urban areas, it rarely takes more than 1 h to get to the nearest large-scale hospital. Thus, what truly affects CIFS scores is how long it takes to get to the nearest hospital rather than whether one's place of residence is in an urban area. Enrollment in the state-run health insurance system is mandatory in Taiwan. At present, medical expenses incurred by COVID-19 are covered by the government. As a result, what influenced CIFS scores was not whether an individual had health insurance but how far he or she lived from the nearest hospital.",

With regard to information dissemination, the government passed laws to penalize the spread of false information, and this may have reduced the dissemination of unconfirmed rumors. Furthermore, the government held daily press conferences about the epidemic to notify the public about new confirmed cases and other information, and the daily announcements of official information may have reduced the anxiety of the public. In Taiwan, the government covers the expenses of the National Health Insurance. To prevent cover-ups, the government also bears all of the expenses for COVID-19 treatment.
