Here we explore the possibility that subcutaneous REGEN-COV prevents SARS-CoV-2 infection and subsequent Covid-19 in individuals at high risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2 by close exposure in a household with a documented SARS-CoV-2-infected individual. Methods: Individuals \u2265 12 years were enrolled within 96 hours of a household contact being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 and randomized 1:1 to receive 1200 mg REGEN-COV or placebo via subcutaneous injection. The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of participants without evidence of infection (SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCRnegative) or prior immunity (seronegative) who subsequently developed symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection during a 28-day efficacy assessment period. Results: Subcutaneous REGEN-COV significantly prevented symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection compared with placebo (81.4% risk reduction; 11/753 [1.5%] vs. 59/752 [7.8%], respectively; P<0.0001), with 92.6% risk reduction after the first week (2/753 [0.3%] vs. 27/752 [3.6%], respectively). REGEN-COV also prevented overall infections, either symptomatic or asymptomatic (66.4% risk reduction). Among infected participants, the median time to resolution of symptoms was 2 weeks shorter with REGEN-COV vs. placebo (1.2 vs. 3.2 weeks, respectively), and the duration of time with high viral load (>10 4 copies/mL) was lower (0.4 vs. 1.3 weeks, respectively).",

(which was not certified by peer review) INTRODUCTION Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first emerged in December 2019 and was declared a global pandemic in March 2020. [1] [2] [3] Casirivimab and imdevimab (REGEN-COV TM ), a monoclonal antibody combination consisting of two neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (administered together) that bind non-competing epitopes of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein receptor binding domain, retains neutralization potency against circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern in vitro and in vivo (including B.1.1.7, B.1.429, B.1.351, and P.1) and may protect against the selection of resistant variants. [4] [5] [6] In outpatients with Covid-19, REGEN-COV reduced hospitalization or all-cause death by approximately 70%, while rapidly reducing viral load and shortening symptom duration. 7, 8 This study evaluated whether subcutaneously administered REGEN-COV could be used to prevent Covid-19 among persons with ongoing exposure to a SARS-CoV-2infected individual. A household contact study design was utilized to assess whether REGEN-COV could prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in a scenario with high risk of lateral transmission; this scenario was considered generalizable to other prevention settings.",

In the outpatient setting, treatment with intravenous REGN-COV reduced Covid-19-related hospitalization or all-cause death, rapidly resolved symptoms, and reduced viral load. 7, 8 In designing this phase 3 clinical trial, we anticipated a high background rate of lateral transmission in a household with a documented SARS-CoV-2-infected individual quarantining alongside other household members, as has subsequently been confirmed. 10 This scenario serves as an exemplar for many other scenarios where uninfected individuals are in close proximity and would be at high risk for infection, including hospitals, nursing homes, dense housing complexes, and schools.

A heat map showing presence of symptoms and viral load over time in infected individuals shows the prolonged time course for individuals receiving placebo compared with REGEN-COV-treated individuals (Figure S3). The incidence of TEAEs was higher in the placebo group than the group receiving REGEN-COV, with the difference attributed to the higher number of Covid-19 infections observed in the placebo group.
