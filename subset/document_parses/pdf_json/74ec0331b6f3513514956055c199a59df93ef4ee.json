Surfactant is widely used in respiratory distress syndrome (70.1%), but there is less unanimity on its use in meconium aspiration syndrome (58.0%), transient tachypnoea of the newborn (30.6%), congenital pneumonia (27.2%) and congenital diaphragmatic hernia (8.6%).

Such variability in care can be explained by a lack of evidence-based practice and may contribute to the currently observed morbidity among LPT infants. Using a survey on surfactant use in LPT infants across all Belgian neonatologists, a high response rate (86%) was obtained which is significantly above a recommended 65% level [7] . Such makes this survey representative and thus less open to bias.",

            "text": "There are some limitations to creating a case-based survey. Firstly, as with any survey, data that are being produced are always likely to lack details or depth on the topic being investigated [7] . Secondly, at the outset of severe pulmonary disease in LPT infants the underlying aetiology is frequently unclear: respiratory disease often starts as a delayed respiratory transition and its subsequent course can be unpredictable. Thirdly, many LPT infants present mixed characteristics of nRDS, TTN and PPHN in the course of the same respiratory disease. In order to avoid ambiguous answers, we therefore opted to 'simplify' our survey using clearly delineated case presentations. A survey based on such well-described clinical cases is therefore somewhat different from the reality, as when confronted with an infant in respiratory distress, an exact diagnosis can only be obtained through the integration of anamnestic, clinical, imaging (especially lung ultrasound) and biological data (e.g. CRP). Such requires time and a significant effort, but it is the only way to understand what is the actual situation of that patient in that particular moment. This is particularly important as surfactant is expensive and may not always be effective. Fourthly, by looking at LPT infants (and thus a group of infants with a specific GA), we do not imply that surfactant administration should be based on GA. Clearly, the underlying pathophysiology of respiratory illnesses in these infants is a major reason why not all LPT infants may benefit from surfactant administration. Fifthly, a case-based survey remains a theoretical exercise on 'intended care', so caution is needed during the interpretation of answers. Finally, given the relatively small local newborn population (i.e. a total of approximately 6000 admissions annually across all Belgian NICUs), results need to be interpreted with caution. Indeed, some answers may have been influenced by the way neonatal health care is organised in Belgium and as such might be less relevant in different settings.",

However, it remains important to determine when CPAP alone will not be effective. Whilst earlier studies recommend that surfactant should be administered as soon as FiO 2 > 0.30 for very immature babies and FiO 2 > 0.40 for more mature infants, the 2019 European directive recommends a threshold of FiO 2 > 0.30 to be used for all infants with a clinical diagnosis of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (nRDS) regardless of their GA [4] . The majority (76%) of the Belgian neonatologists agrees with the principle that FiO 2 > 0.30 in the first hours of life is a reasonable predictor of CPAP failure [9] and supports referral to a level III NICU as soon as FiO 2 > 0.30 at the age of 12 h. Intubation and ventilation are rarely used in nRDS (6.6%), whilst such is more common in MAS, CP and severe TTN. A reduction of the percentage of invasive mechanical ventilation during the first 3 days of respiratory disease in LPT infants may thus be feasible in our country and should be aimed for, in line with the 2019 European directives [4] .",

Some centres use pulmonary ultrasound, which is a promising bedside tool in order to differentiate between TTN and nRDS [10] .

If however surfactant is required before the baby's birth weight is known (surfactant for early rescue therapy), it is acceptable to use whole vial dosing based on an estimated weight [9] .

Amniotic fluid is meconium stained. The infant needs intubation and ventilation at the age of 1 min. At the age of 3 h, the infant saturates 86% with invasive ventilation (SIMV), pressures 24/5 cm H 2 O, frequency 45/min, FiO 2 0.60. Chest X-ray is patchy. The following parameters are available on an arterial blood gas: pH 7.10, PaCO 2 55 mmHg and PaO 2 45 mmHg. Cardiac ultrasound demonstrates evidence of pulmonary hypertension. GA infant is born (2.900 g) after an urgent Caesarean section within the context of acute maternal blood loss (abruption of the placenta). The infant is born in good condition, but needs FiO 2 0.30 during the first golden minutes of life. Intravenous access is obtained, blood culture taken. The infant is transferred to the NICU with nCPAP and FiO 2 0.30. At the age of 2 h, the chest X-ray shows extra fluid in the fissures separating the long lobes. At the age of 4 h, having inserted umbilical lines, the infant remains tachypnoeic and needs FiO 2 0.40. Case 4 A 35-week GA infant is born (2.750 g); the mother is GBS positive. There is no PPROM.The infant needs 5 insufflations, remains tachypnoeic (90/min) and is in need of FiO 2 0.35. IV access is obtained, blood culture taken and IV antibiotics are started. The infant is transferred with nCPAP to the NICU. At the age of 2 h, chest X-ray shows patchy lung fields. CRP level is 42 mg/L on D0. The infant remains tachypnoeic and needs FiO 2 between 0.30 and 0.40. Case 5 A 36-week GA infant is born (2.900 g); the mother is GBS negative. The infant presents with severe respiratory distress at birth, requiring intubation and ventilation. A chest X-ray demonstrates the presence of bowel in the left hemi-thorax. At the age of 3 h, SIMV ventilation is switched to high-frequency oscillation ventilation with the following settings: mean airway pressure 11 cm H 2 O, Delta P 28 cm H 2 O, FiO 2 0.45. An arterial blood gas shows pH 7.15, PaCO 2 52 mmHg, PaO 2 49 mmHg. The infant continues to saturate at best 82%.",
