Mode A of VirusSi designs siRNAs against an existing virus, incorporating considerations on siRNA properties, off-target effects, viral RNA structure and viral mutations. It designs multiple siRNAs out of which the top candidate targets >99% of SARS-CoV-2 strains, and the combination of the top four siRNAs is predicted to target all SARS-CoV-2 strains. Additionally, we develop Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (GAR) and Similarity-weighted Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (SGAR) to support the Mode B of VirusSi, which pre-designs siRNAs against future emerging viruses based on existing viral sequences. Time-simulations using known coronavirus genomes as early as 10 years prior to the COVID-19 outbreak show that at least three SARS-CoV-2-targeting siRNAs are among the top 30 pre-designed siRNAs. Before-theoutbreak pre-design is also possible against the MERS-CoV virus and the 2009-H1N1 swine flu virus. Our data support the feasibility of pre-designing anti-viral siRNA therapeutics prior to viral outbreaks. We propose the development of a collection of pre-designed, safety-tested, and off-the-shelf siRNAs that could accelerate responses toward future viral diseases.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2, the COVID-19-causing coronavirus, belongs to a family of positive-sense and single-strand RNA viruses (1) (2) (3) . This virus family is notorious for its high mutation rates, which suggests that immunity triggered by either a vaccine or a previous infection may not be long-lasting. Targeting the SARS-CoV-2 genome using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or CRISPR can be an alternative therapeutic approach. This is because a mixture of multiple siRNAs or CRISPR RNAs, targeting different regions of the viral genome, could theoretically be delivered into susceptible tissues such as lung epithelium. Cleavage of viral RNA by siRNA or CRISPR could thus reduce the viral load and limit further infection (4) (5) (6) . Recently, Timothy et al. reported a proof-of-concept Cas13d system for degrading viral RNAs (7) , in which the intriguing idea of designing crRNAs that target multiple respiratory viruses has been explored (7) . However, the design of crRNAs in that study uses SARS-CoV-2 sequence as an input, which does not test the feasibility toward preparing for a future viral outbreak. Compared to CRISPR, there are several advantages of using siRNAs as anti-viral therapies. The siRNA approach avoids the challenge of delivering large Cas gene products into cells in vivo. Efficacy of a cocktail of multiple siRNAs against the EBOLA virus has been demonstrated successful in vivo in primate models (8) . Additionally, pulmonary delivery of siRNAs is possible to knock down target genes in animal lung (9) (10) (11) (12) , and has been used to limit respiratory viruses in animal models (13) . A recent preprint further shows the feasibility of intranasal administration of siRNAs to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load and symptoms in Syrian hamster and Rhesus macaque models (14) .",

Furthermore, there are several technical limitations in these existing studies. First, limited numbers (maximum of 143) of SARS-CoV-2 genomes have been used, which could make some previously designed siRNAs fall into genetically variable regions of the viral genome. Second, off-target effects of siRNAs have not been always considered, with potential unintended regulation of endogenous genes by designed siRNAs.

The first rule set was modified from those in the GPP Web Portal for short hairpin RNA designs. In addition, the VirusSi pipeline provides a second rule set based on those used in the RNAxs program (20) (see Methods) that users can choose from. For the first rule set, we kept several criteria used in GPP Web Portal: excluding any siRNA candidate ending with TT, excluding any candidate containing a run of four of the same base in a row, selecting siRNA candidates with proper AT percentage (25% to 60%), excluding .

Additionally, we added the requirement for the first base of the functional siRNA strand to be a U. This is because the crystal structure of human Argonaute 2 (AGO2), the core component of the siRNA machinery, has revealed a preference of binding to small RNAs with a first base of U or A (21, 22) , and because the majority of endogenous AGO2-bound RNA, namely miRNAs, start with a U (23) . Furthermore, we eliminated several rules in the GPP Web Portal: the exclusion of restriction site which only applies to the cloning of shRNAs, the consideration of potential stem-loop structure in target site because we incorporated another strategy for the influence of target RNA structure (see below).",

Initially, we tested the seemingly straightforward strategy of identifying a collection of siRNAs, each of which could target the most numbers of input viral strains. However, using the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as an example, none of the top 100 pre-designed siRNAs by this approach could target SARS-CoV-2 effectively (Supplementary Table S2 , and see Methods). As an alternative, the Greedy algorithm (referred to hereafter as \"conventional Greedy algorithm\" or CGA), originally designed to solve the mathematical maximum coverage problem, could be used to identify the smallest number of siRNAs to ensure that each of the existing input viral strains could be targeted by at least one siRNA. By iterative evaluation of siRNAs to minimize the number of siRNAs to cover most strains (see flow chart in Supplementary Figure S2A ), CGA could allow the possible prediction of at least one siRNA against a future virus, with the underlying assumption that any emerging future virus would bear some level of sequence similarity to one of the existing input viruses. However, for the purpose of building a collection of siRNAs against future viruses, having a single siRNA would not provide strong robustness in the system, because there could be failures of siRNA candidates due to issues of efficacy or safety (14) . We thus developed the Greedy Algorithm with Redundancy (GAR) which reduced the penalty for siRNAs against viral strains that were targeted by already-selected siRNAs (see flow chart in Supplementary Figure S2B ). By incorporating a Multi-siRNA parameter (see methods for details), GAR could thus tune the robustness of the prediction.",

The reduced performance was associated with reduced number of input strains, with 218 stains for data ending in 2010 and 163 strains for data ending in 2008. We next tested pre-designing against SARS-CoV-1. Only 54 human/bat coronavirus sequences were available prior to 2002. Among the Top 100 SGAR-predicted siRNAs based on such input sequences, none could target SARS-CoV-1. These data indicate that pre-designing siRNAs against MERS-CoV can be achieved using sequence information prior to the outbreak. At the same time, out data suggest that the scarcity of human/bat coronavirus sequences in early years weaken the performance of the algorithm and makes it difficult to pre-design siRNAs against SARS-CoV-1.",

Our data of pre-design against SARS-CoV-2, MERS-CoV and 2009-H1N1 suggest that a collection of a small number (~30) of pre-designed siRNAs could have a good likelihood of targeting future viruses. The small number is key, because clinical trials will be both expensive and time consuming. To make use of the pre-designed siRNAs, efforts first need to be put into validating the efficacy of each siRNA, possibly using synthetic targets as a readout through in vitro experiments in cell culture, as well as using existing viral strains if they match the designed siRNA. This should be a reasonably fast process that can determine which pre-designed siRNAs should be weeded out due to the lack of targeting efficacy. As we demonstrated, additional siRNAs could be quickly designed using VirusSi to replace such failed siRNAs. siRNAs that successfully met efficacy criteria could undergo further testing using animal models.

RNA secondary structure, which is difficult to predict accurately across long RNA sequences, and the presence of RNA binding proteins, may affect siRNA efficacy. Similarly, while our pipeline takes consideration of predicted off-target effects, the full spectrum of off-target effects could only be revealed in in vivo experimentation, possibly through both pre-clinical studies and clinical trials. Additionally, while the delivery of siRNAs into lung cells in vivo has been demonstrated in animal models (9) (10) (11) (12) and has been shown to reduce virulence in two SARS-CoV-2 models in vivo (14) , delivery of multiple siRNAs into lung cells with high delivery efficiency still require intense experimentation before such siRNAs could be used as anti-viral therapeutics.
