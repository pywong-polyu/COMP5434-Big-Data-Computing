Its main etiological agent is Gardnerella vaginalis, which produces several virulence factors involved in vaginal infection and colonization, in particular, sialidase (SLD), a potential clinical biomarker that participates in immune response modulation and mucus degradation. The main objective of this work was the production and evaluation of a monoclonal antibody against G. vaginalis sialidase and its validation in immunoassays. For immunization of mice, a synthetic multiantigenic peptide was used, and hybridomas were generated. After fusion, hybridomas were evaluated for antibody production and cloned by limited dilution. One clone producing IgG1 was selected and characterized by indirect ELISA, dot blot, and Western blot, and we also tested clinical isolates and HeLa cells infected with G. vaginalis. The results showed that the anti-SLD antibody recognized a single protein of~90 kDa that correlated with the estimated molecular weight of SLD. In addition, anti-SLD antibody recognized SLD from complete bacteria and from culture supernatants of infected Hela cells. In conclusion, our results showed that the anti-SLD antibody recognized SLD from different sources and could be considered a new tool for the diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis.",

The associated complications of BV include pelvic inflammatory disease, membrane rupture, low newborn birth weight in pregnant women (Hillier et al. 1995) , and an increase in susceptibility to the acquisition of sexually transmitted diseases, such as chlamydia, trichomonas, herpes virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and human papilloma virus (Buve et al. 2014; Gillet et al. 2011; Hay 2017; Sweet 2000; Thurman et al. 2015) .

Previous studies have shown that high levels of SLD are associated with BV cases, in comparison with the low levels found in healthy women (Briselden et al. 1992; Cauci et al. 1998; Marconi et al. 2013) . The most widely used techniques for SLD determination involve enzymatic eval uat ion using 2-(4-methylumbelliferyl)-d-Nacetylneuraminic acid (MUAN) as a substrate (Marconi et al. 2013) or a rapid test termed BVBlue (Gryphus Diagnostics, LLC) (Myziuk et al. 2003) . In spite of this, the generation of new biological products to evaluate the roles of SLD during BV development and the standardization of new diagnostic techniques based on antigen-antibody reactions are needed, which could improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity. Taking into account all of the above-mentioned, the aim of this study was the production and characterization of a monoclonal antibody directed against G. vaginalis SLD.",

For this, the bacteria were cultured for 72 h and the samples were collected at different times (Fig. 4a) . We observed that after the first 30 min, the bacteria begin to produce SLD, and the increase was proportional to the growth phase (Fig. 4b) . Next, SLD production was evaluated by dot blot in 67 clinical isolates of G. vaginalis from women with normal microbiota (NM; n = 45) and bacterial vaginosis (BV; n = 22) belonging to four (1, 2, 5, and 6) of the eight different G. vaginalis biotypes (Table 1) . Results showed that the amount of SLD produced varied between isolates, and even between complete bacteria and supernatants (Fig.  5a) . Using the previous blots, we analyzed in a semi-qualitative way the amount of SLD in the samples isolated from women with NM and BV, observing similar results in both groups (Fig.  5b ). In addition, samples were separated according to biotype; 1 (n = 15), 2 (n = 6), 5 (n = 11), and 6 (n = 35) (Table 1) , and we observed that biotypes 2 and 5 secreted less SLD in comparison to biotypes 1 and 6 (Fig. 5c) . In addition, we investigated if the anti-SLD mAb could be used for the specific detection of G. vaginalis in HeLa cells infected and uninfected with the bacteria in the same way as in the clinical samples. Thus, we infected HeLa cells with G. vaginalis ATCC 14018 strain with a MOI of 1 and 20 for 2 and 4 h and evaluated SLD in culture supernatants by ELISA and dot blot (Fig. 6a) . By indirect ELISA, we did not observe recognition of SLD by anti-SLD mAb in non-infected cells, while in cells infected at MOI 1 and 20, high recognition was observed for both infection periods (2 and 4 h) (Fig. 6b) , and similar results were observed with dot blots (Fig. 6c ).",

SLD plays important roles in obtaining nutrients, colonization, and host immune response evasion (Harvey et al. 2001; Lewis et al. 2012; Marconi et al. 2013) .

The MAP8 format increases the peptide size and structural complexity and allows increased antigenicity during immunization; it is also commonly used as diagnostic reagent and vaccine (Joshi et al. 2013) . After fusion evaluation, seven anti-SLD producing clones were obtained (Fig. 1b) . We selected clone 1H12 due to in vitro growth and the type of immunoglobulin class produced.

In Western blot, a single of band of~90 kDa was detected, which was a preliminary indicator of the antibody specificity (Fig. 3) . All of the preliminary data supported the hypothesis that the chosen sequence exposes an epitope that allows SLD identification under several conditions necessary for immunoassays. Another interesting fact is that the anti-SLD mAb showed high recognition in samples of complete bacteria and culture supernatant, which could mean that during the secretion process, SLD first is anchored to the membrane (Rodriguez-Walker and Daniotti 2017), and after being secreted, commences its function of obtaining nutrients (Lewis et al. 2013 ). In addition, antibody recognition of the ATCC 14018 strain and the clinical isolates provides evidence regarding the extent of conservation of the selected epitope among the different G. vaginalis biotypes (Figs. 3 and 5) .",

In the preliminary analysis of SLD production in the clinical biotypes, we did not find any difference between SLD production among the biotypes, or its association with BV. One possible explanation is that the stress of cell culture could induce the production of SLD; complementary studies need to be performed to prove this hypothesis.",
