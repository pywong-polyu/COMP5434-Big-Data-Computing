The most common COVID-19 symptoms are fever, cough, fatigue, dyspnea and sputum [3] . COVID-19 is a highly contagious disease and one infected person can infect two to three other people [4] . SARS-CoV-2 spreads mainly through human-to-human transmission via respiratory droplets generated when an infected person coughs, sneezes or speaks [1, 5] . Fomite transmission by touching a contaminated surface and then touching eyes, nose or mouth also occurs [5] . Moreover, there is a scientific debate on the airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infections (the percentage of infections that occurred through airborne transmission) but scientific evidence is inconclusive [5, 6] . On 11 March 2020, the World Health Organization announced the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic [7] . However, the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic differ across the",

In Poland, diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the detection of unique sequences of SARS-COV-2 virus ribonucleic acid by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [11, 12] . This study includes data from April to the end of October 2020. Figure 1 presents smoothed new cases and new deaths for the analyzed period. This time limit was chosen due to the following reasons: (1) since April, wide access to laboratory diagnostics and RT-PCR tests on patients suspected of having COVID-19 has been provided throughout Poland; (2) on 26 October, significant changes in quarantine rules have been implemented; and (3) on 31 October, surveillance definition for COVID-19 was significantly revised and the possibility of using rapid antigen tests has been implemented. The changes in quarantine rules, the COVID-19 case definition and the possibility of performing an antigen test instead of the RT-PCR test could significantly affect the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. For this reason, this study includes data from April to the end of October 2020. Moreover, the period chosen for the analysis took place in order to better detect the effects of the meteorological conditions on the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic, since inserting data from October onwards into the analysis would make the investigation of the meteorological conditions/COVID-19 relationship unfeasible. rience the largest annual sum of precipitation and the maximum monthly sum is observed in July and the minimum in February.

In Poland, diagnosis of COVID-19 is based on the detection of unique sequences of SARS-COV-2 virus ribonucleic acid by real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) [11, 12] . This study includes data from April to the end of October 2020. Figure 1 presents smoothed new cases and new deaths for the analyzed period. This time limit was chosen due to the following reasons: (1) since April, wide access to laboratory diagnostics and RT-PCR tests on patients suspected of having COVID-19 has been provided throughout Poland; (2) on 26 October, significant changes in quarantine rules have been implemented; and (3) on 31 October, surveillance definition for COVID-19 was significantly revised and the possibility of using rapid antigen tests has been implemented. The changes in quarantine rules, the COVID-19 case definition and the possibility of performing an antigen test instead of the RT-PCR test could significantly affect the number of laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases. For this reason, this study includes data from April to the end of October 2020. Moreover, the period chosen for the analysis took place in order to better detect the effects of the meteorological conditions on the dynamics of COVID-19 pandemic, since inserting data from October onwards into the analysis would make the investigation of the meteorological conditions/COVID-19 relationship unfeasible. In order to assess the influence of meteorological conditions on pandemic dynamics, the meteorological observations from 55 synoptic stations in Poland were used ( Figure 2 ). On their basis we created a dataset which include averaged daily values of maximum temperature, minimum temperature, variability of mean daily temperature, sunshine duration, wind speed, and relative humidity for the whole of Poland. In Figure 3 , time series of these parameters are shown.

By arranging all the series of metrological data listed above together with the series of daily numbers of COVID-19-related deaths in one observation matrix and employing PCA algorithm working on such an input matrix, we obtained results confirming some statistical dependence of the variables. A series of daily number of COVID-19-related deaths respond maximally to the 1st PC, which in turn represents the most significant proportion of the data variance (85.3%). These results allow us to conclude that the most statistically dependent meteorological variable with the number of deaths is relative humidity. Maximum temperature, as well as sunshine duration, ischaracterized by inverse proportionality to the number of COVID-19-related deaths, whichmeans that some effects (occurring over the entire observed time range) seen byincreasing the value of one variable are parallel to decreasing the value of the other variable. Second and 3rd PCs and the next ones are not worth analyzing as the percentage of variance indicates their low statistical significance.",

We can hypothesize that due to the asymptomatic course of COVID-19, the real number of COVID-19 cases couldbe higher than the laboratory detected figure. Nevertheless, we used data from official governmental announcements that are only available data on the COVID-19 pandemic in Poland. Some authors suggest that all-cause mortality can be used as a reliable estimator of the real COVID-19 death toll [48, 49] . It is estimated that deaths attributed to COVID-19 may be underestimated by at least 35% [49] . In Poland, approximately 70,000 excess deaths were reported during the pandemic. It is estimated that 43% of them are caused by COVID-19, and 27% occurred among people previously diagnosed with COVID-19 [11] . This observation is in line with the hypothesis that all-cause mortality should be considered as a reliable estimator of the real COVID-19 death tool. Secondly, synoptic data come from stations usually located outside of most populated areas. On the other hand, cities suffer mostly from pandemic impacts. It is well known that cities experience Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects [50] . These human-induced phenomena modify surface and atmospheric properties in comparison to surrounding nonurban areas. Observed increase inUHI temperature changes atmospheric circulation and influences other wind and humidity patterns. It is also expected that UHI effects will intensify with observed climate change [51] .",
