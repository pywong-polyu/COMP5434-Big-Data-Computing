            "text": "Background: In several recent articles, authors have called for aligning the fields of implementation and improvement science. In this paper, we call for implementation science to also align with improvement practice. Multiple implementation scholars have highlighted the importance of designing implementation strategies to fit the existing culture, infrastructure, and practice of a healthcare system. Worldwide, healthcare systems are adopting improvement models as their primary approach to improving healthcare delivery and outcomes. The prevalence of improvement models raises the question of how implementation scientists might best align their efforts with healthcare systems' existing improvement infrastructure and practice. Main body: We describe three challenges and five benefits to aligning implementation science and improvement practice. Challenges include (1) use of different models, terminology, and methods, (2) a focus on generalizable versus local knowledge, and (3) limited evidence in support of the effectiveness of improvement tools and methods. We contend that implementation science needs to move beyond these challenges and work toward greater alignment with improvement practice. Aligning with improvement practice would benefit implementation science by (1) strengthening research/practice partnerships, (2) fostering local ownership of implementation, (3) generating practice-based evidence, (4) developing context-specific implementation strategies, and (5) building practice-level capacity to implement interventions and improve care. Each of these potential benefits is illustrated in a case study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's Cancer Prevention and Control Research Network.",

These authors contend that closer alignment would promote \"cross-fertilization,\" with each field learning from and building on the other's expertise, methods, and frameworks [2] . While we recognize the value of closer alignment between implementation science and improvement science, we contend that implementation science may gain as much or more from greater alignment with improvement practice. Implementation science and improvement science both aim to produce generalizable knowledge to guide the improvement of healthcare services and health outcomes but differ in their approach. Implementation science focuses on increasing the uptake of evidence-based interventions (EBIs) whereas improvement science focuses on iteratively measuring and improving care processes and systems (2) . Improvement science has its foundation in the field of improvement practice, which also focuses on improving care processes and systems (1) . Improvement practice is distinct from improvement science in that its goal is to produce the local (rather than generalizable) knowledge needed to improve care in a specific setting [1] . In this paper, we acknowledge other scholars' observations on the value of aligning implementation science and improvement science: for example, the opportunity to share their respective expertise in assessing contextual factors and engaging practice-level stakeholders in the co-creation of solutions [2] . However, we move beyond this prior work by highlighting the need for greater alignment between implementation science and improvement practice, with improvement practice defined as practice-initiated efforts to design and redesign work processes and systems with the goal of improving local outcomes [4] .",

In this paper, we describe three challenges and five benefits of aligning implementation science with improvement practice.

While the approaches have similar objectives, the two fields use different terminology and apply different techniques. For example, both implementation science and improvement practice promote approaches for identifying contextual factors that contribute to a problem and/or inform a practice change. Both fields also promote strategies, interventions, and tools for use in developing and testing solutions to problems. The implementation science literature describes a multitude of strategies, with one widely cited taxonomy listing 73 distinct strategies [27] . In contrast, each improvement model offers its own distinct and relatively small list of interventions and tools, such as Fishbone diagrams, the Five Why's, and process flow diagrams among others [28] . Although many of these interventions and tools are similar across models, they may vary in terminology, format, methods, and frameworks. These variations not only create barriers to communication among implementation scientists and improvement practice professionals, but also create confusion among the frontline providers and staff who are central to the hands-on work of implementing EBIs.",

For example, Taylor and colleagues [30] reviewed studies that used Plan-Do-Study-Act (PDSA cycles), a widely used improvement tool that involves multiple, small, rapid tests of a local improvement. They found that 81% (59/73) of studies failed to report the conduct of iterative cycles of change, and only two of the studies reviewed demonstrated healthcare system compliance with all key principles of the PDSA cycle method [30] . Reed and Card (2016) determined that teams rarely completed the full PDSA cycle, putting most of their effort into \"Doing\" and far less into \"Studying\" and \"Acting\" [31] . In a systematic review of the literature, Hill et al. (2020) found mixed evidence for the effect of quality improvement on health services and little evidence for effects on health outcomes [32] . The limited evidence in support of effectiveness may lead implementation scientists to dismiss improvement practice as an approach that does not work. However, this is not the conclusion of Hill et al. who point to the poor quality of evaluation methods, complexity of the changes being evaluated, and the need for more well-designed studies to demonstrate quality improvement's effectiveness [32] .",

Furthermore, these stakeholders may resist the input of researchers outside their organizations, as reflected in a recent article where authors refer to implementation science as tending toward \"scientific imperialism\" and an \"overall approach that disrespects and undervalues primary care as a coproducer of knowledge\" [33] . This observation not only applies to primary care but also to other healthcare systems and providers.

Recognizing and respecting this reality may be key to implementation scientists gaining entr\u00e9e into healthcare systems and engaging stakeholders in the adoption, adaptation, and implementation of new EBIs [34] .

Recent years have seen a growing emphasis on the importance of this type of \"practice-based\" evidence, which Leeman and Sandelowski defined as \"evidence concerning the contexts, experiences, and practices of healthcare providers working in real-world practice settings\" [38] . Improvement models (e.g., Lean Six Sigma, the Improvement Model) typically consist of a systematic, multistep approach that involves the use of specific tools to describe current processes (e.g., process maps) and identify the root causes of problems with or gaps in those processes (e.g., fishbone diagrams). These tools are designed to capture team members' local knowledge of the factors that influence care delivery and outcomes within a specific setting and population. In this way, practical considerations drive the selection, testing, and refinement of candidate solutions for a given evidencepractice gap. By partnering with improvement teams on the use of process maps and other improvement tools, implementation scientists can elicit the practice-based evidence needed to select, adapt, and refine EBIs and implementation strategies [39] . This careful attention to local knowledge may be particularly important to efforts to promote health equity, as it is key to identifying factors that contribute to health disparities [40] .",

Furthermore, they often yield a multicomponent implementation strategy that is then \"frozen\" and distributed for replication across multiple settings [37] . While settings may be encouraged to adapt multicomponent implementation strategies, little guidance is provided on how to identify and address contextual factors that may influence implementation in new settings [43] . PDSA cycles offer an approach that implementation scientists might apply to engage local improvement teams in rapid, iterative testing of implementation strategies.

            "text": "Recently, UNC researchers partnered on a clinicinitiated project to address a sudden drop in colorectal cancer (CRC) screening rates. In October 2018, the practice's QI committee noted a steep decrease in CRC screening rates while reviewing standard clinical quality measures. A subgroup of the QI committee was formed to study the problem and implement potential solutions. The team conducted a root-cause analysis and found that prior interventions, in which CRC screening home test kits were distributed during annual clinic visits, increased CRC screening rates. However, the interventions were not sustained over time, resulting in a drop in screening rates. To identify a more sustainable solution, the team engaged UNC researchers with expertise in mailed CRC test kit outreach, a CRC screening intervention that does not require a clinic visit and has limited impact on clinic workflows. Researchers partnered with the team on multiple PDSA cycles to develop a protocol for mailing CRC test kits, targeting patients who had previously completed a screening kit but were now overdue (Fig. 2) . From November 2018 to April 2019, eligible patients received (a) a mailed packet containing an introductory letter and a screening kit, and (b) a reminder message through the patient portal. A total of 160 screening kits were mailed across four waves. In the first three waves, adjustments were made between mailings to improve the materials (e.g., wave 2 included an edited introductory letter, wave 3 included a Spanish language letter). As illustrated in Fig. 2 , the project achieved its goal of increasing CRC screening rates to above 77%. This case study illustrates the importance of researcher support for a practice-initiated project in developing strong research/practice partnerships. Through their decade-long partnership with this clinic, CPCRN researchers have engaged clinic stakeholders in multiple researcher-initiated projects [49, 50] . screening. Patient navigation is an evidence-based intervention that employs patient navigators to guide patients through the health care system and reduce barriers to screening and treatment [51] . In 2018, CCSP partnered with National Jewish Health to develop training, materials, and tools to expand patient navigation to lung cancer screening. In 2019, CCSP invited members of their statewide network of clinic systems to pilot the materials and tools. Guided by the PRISM framework [52] , the CCSP team conducted an assessment to determine clinic readiness and selected two community health centers with the organizational capacity (i.e., commitment to cancer screening and staffing resources and time) and environmental supports (i.e., access to hospital or radiology practices to provide low-dose computed tomography [CT] screening services) needed to pilot test the lung cancer screening materials and tools. One of the tools was a process flow template outlining the processes that clinics and patient navigators would use to identify patients eligible for screening, engage providers and patients in shared decision making, refer patients to CT lung cancer centers/hospitals, and track processes and outcomes [53, 54] . CCSP provided technical assistance to aid clinics in adapting the process flow template and creating a process flow diagram that was tailored to each clinic's existing staffing, workflows, and referral arrangement with CT lung cancer centers/hospitals. For example, the more urban of the two pilot clinics shares an electronic health record (EHR) with its CT provider. This shared system allows their primary care team to have a streamlined process flow diagram for referring patients and tracking processes and outcomes (Fig. 3) . In contrast, the rural clinic does not have a formal connection with its CT provider nor do they share the same EHR. As a result, a more complex process flow diagram was needed to outline the processes needed to refer patients and track outcomes (see Additional File 1: Lung Cancer Screening Workflow). The approach to customizing workflows, while maintaining fidelity to the guidelines, allows the decision makers within each system to embrace lung cancer screening and implement it within existing capacity and resources while also planning for longer-term sustainability of their efforts. UNC researchers are incorporating process flow diagramming throughout the design, implementation, and evaluation of their National Institutes of Health (NIH)-funded Scaling Colorectal Cancer Screening through Outreach, Referral, and Engagement (SCORE) study. In collaboration with two community health centers, SCORE is testing the effectiveness of an intervention that combines mailed CRC screening home test kits, patient reminders, and navigation to follow-up colonoscopy for patients with a positive test result. Process flow diagrams are being used to highlight key differences in the process steps and to delineate roles and resources needed based on feedback from clinic staff about their local context and standards of care. The research team iteratively developed the process maps through multiple stakeholderengaged sessions. The maps reflect input from program directors and staff at the community health centers where SCORE is being implemented. Each diagram documents all steps in the process and identifies which individuals perform each step. The team created a separate diagram for each of the core components of the SCORE intervention, which include developing a registry of eligible patients, conducting a mailed screening program, and navigating patients with a positive screening test to follow-up colonoscopy.",

The ongoing assessment of these measures during implementation will provide insight into the time and resources required for implementation, potential challenges to implementing the intervention as intended, and opportunities to create efficiencies.

Ideally, implementation scientists would include orientation to improvement practice in the multiple trainings being offered to build capacity in the field of implementation science [58] and would encourage attendees to participate in one or more of the many trainings on improvement practice [16]. To build practice-level capacity, implementation scientists might \"embed\" themselves within healthcare systems' improvement efforts [59, 60] . As illustrated in this paper's case studies, implementation scientists, often in partnership with other intermediary organizations (e.g., American Cancer Society, National Jewish Health), provide learning collaboratives, training, and technical assistance to support clinics' use of EBIs and quality improvement models and tools. The case studies illustrate how researchers began by assessing partners' capacity (or readiness) to use improvement models and tools and then tailored their training and other strategies accordingly. By doing so, they built practice partners' capacity to use improvement tools and models to implement and sustain EBIs over time. In our examples, the improvement tools that CPCRN researchers supported included run charts, process flow diagrams, root cause analysis, quality monitoring systems, and PDSA cycles.
