Previously, the policy focus was specialist mental health care via community teams and then discharge to primary care for those with less, but often still significant, need, thus presenting a significant divide between primary and secondary care. PARTNERS1, which ran during this previous policy, found that nearly a third of people in the UK with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, bipolar, or other psychoses were seen only in primary care. 1 Poor continuity of care and lack of information exchange between primary and secondary care created barriers to effective support. To overcome these challenges, the PARTNERS model was developed to improve collaboration between secondary care, primary care, and the service user.",

The intervention was founded on Wagner's Chronic Care Model, 2 principles of personal recovery, 3 and coaching for mental health. 4 The programme theory and practice were iteratively developed utilising a realist approach, 5,6 wider literature, primary data, and stakeholder input. 7 The intervention was 'fixed' after the refinement in this feasibility stage. 8 Approaches to recruitment were tested iteratively involving flexibility for non-responders and support from NHS employed researchers for pre-consent work (initial identification and approach by letter and telephone) in primary care. A core outcome set for use in bipolar disorder trials was developed. 9 To account for the wider psychosis target population in PARTNERS2 and the nature of the intervention, an additional stakeholder consultation was undertaken to select outcomes and measures. QoL was selected as the most important outcome domain. Relevant measures of QoL were reviewed and the Manchester Short Assessment Quality of Life (MANSA) was selected on the basis of being clinically relevant to the target population and as potentially amenable to change by the intervention. The MANSA has good validity and reasonable internal consistency. 10 Challenges during trial set up, internal pilot, and COVID-19",

Changing circumstances in host NHS Trusts and delays in trial set-up led to withdrawals from the study of one trust during setup, and the Lancashire Care Foundation Trust during the early phase of recruitment, resulting in the need to identify new host trusts. Although not all recruitment targets had been met, recruitment in two trusts (Cornwall and Plymouth) had been shown to be successful, and thus the trial was continued pending a delayed sample size review carried out in late 2019. As detailed in Table 1 , this review led, in December 2019, to the recommendation from the trial oversight groups (Data Monitoring Committee [DMC] and Trial Steering Committee [TSC]) for a reduction of the original sample size. In January 2020, the funder requested recruitment to stop in order to complete the trial within the funding envelope and with a change in power (see sample size section below).",

This assumes an mean average of 6 participants per cluster, 20% drop out at the individual participant level, and 10% drop out at the cluster level. The trial protocol included an interim blinded review of the assumptions underpinning the original sample size calculation. The pre-specified review was based on data from 39 participants with complete baseline and follow-up primary outcome data, and explored the a priori assumption of a correlation of 0.5 between baseline and follow-up MANSA scores, but which had not been included in the original sample size calculation. From the blinded review, the point estimate of this correlation was 0.69 (80% confidence interval [CI] = 0.56 to 0.79), and, as such, it was deemed appropriate to conservatively allow for a correlation of 0.5 in a revised sample size calculation. Retaining all the other original assumptions of the sample size calculation indicated a recruitment target of 270 participants from around 45 GP practices, to achieve 90% power or 204 participants from around 34 GP practices to achieve 80% power, to detect the pre-specified between-group difference of 0.45 units.

Results without adjustment for the stratification variables will also be presented. Model assumptions will be checked and appropriate data transformations sought if required. Continuous secondary outcomes will be analysed similarly. All treatment effect estimates will be presented alongside 95% CIs.
