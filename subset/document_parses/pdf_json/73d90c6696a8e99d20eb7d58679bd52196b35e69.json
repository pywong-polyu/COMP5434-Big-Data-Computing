Quanta generation rates were selected based on COVID-19 events reported in the literature while mask efficiency was determined from the aerosol dispersion experiments. Results: The MID-AFT cabin exhibits the highest infection probability. The calculated maximum individual infection probability (without masks) for a 2-hour flight in this section U N C O R R E C T E D M A N U S C R I P T 3 varies from 4.5% for the \"Mild Scenario\" to 60.2% for the \"Severe Scenario\" although the corresponding average infection probability varies from 0.1% to 2.5%. For a 12-hour flight, the corresponding maximum individual infection probability varies from 24.1% to 99.6% and the average infection probability varies from 0.8% to 10.8%. If all passengers wear face masks throughout the 12-hour flight, the average infection probability can be reduced by approximately 73%/32% for high/low efficiency masks. If face masks are worn by all passengers except during a one-hour meal service, the average infection probability is increased by 59%/8% compared to the situation where the mask is not removed.",

At the time of writing (late November 2020) as much of the world enters the festive season marked by Thanksgiving and Christmas, more and more people are considering taking flights. Given our current knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and the measures now in place, it is less likely that flights will be a major mechanism for the continued uncontrolled spread of COVID-19 around the world. However, another issue of concern is the possibility of contracting the disease while confined to the small space of the passenger cabin, in close proximity to other passengers, especially for extended periods of time ranging from around 2-hours for short-haul flights to 12-hours or more for long-haul flights.",

As timing is so critical, confirmation of inflight SARS-CoV-2 transmission cases with a high degree of certainty are limited. Seven inflight SARS-CoV-2 transmission events from 24 January 2020 to 21 September 2020 from peer-reviewed or public health publications have been comprehensively reviewed by Freedman et al.

The quanta generation rate used in the 'severe' case is derived from a known inflight COVID-19 asymptotic transmission event [4] . Using Equation (1) with the known infection probability derived for this known inflight COVID-19 transmission event, and the measured average aerosol reduction rate of 99.99% [15] , the quanta generation rates are back-calculated to be at least 100 quanta/h (see Supplementary Material Section 1.3). Furthermore, the choice of the 'extreme' quanta generation rate of 100 quanta/h reflects the findings using extreme value theory that, for SARS-CoV-2, large super spreading events -although rare, make a significant contribution in the overall transmission of the disease [22] . It is also noted that Marcus et al. [14] used 100 quanta/h as the high emission rate for aircraft COVID-19 infection risk analysis.",

[14] estimated the time to infection of 7.5 hours for passengers without wearing masks and 34 hours with wearing face masks for the severe scenario with a quanta generation rate of 100 quanta/h. They stated that their model results were in general agreement with the modelling results from aircraft manufacturers [10] [11] [12] and with the empirical evidence from the US TRANSCOM study [15] and so 'the estimated dose inhaled by an adjacent passenger over a few hours of exposure is likely to be less than the amount necessary to cause a secondary infection'. With an identical quanta generation rate (100 quanta/h) and the maximum BZP data from the MID-AFT section [15] we determine that the minimum time to infection (based on inhalation of 1 quanta) is 2.2 hours without masks, and using the low/high efficiency masks, the minimum time to infection becomes 4.6 hours/18.5 hours (see Figure 1 ). These times to infection are similar to those estimated by Marcus et al. [14] Nevertheless, we prefer to focus on the probabilities of infection within a given timeframe as some readers may misinterpret the \"time to infection\" to mean there is no possibility of infection if they are on-board for less than the stated timescales. If time to infection is used to define an end-point, it is therefore also necessary to specify how this end-point is defined, in particular the quanta dose required to cause infection or the corresponding infection probability associated with the end-point (see Figure 1 ). In our analysis of 'time to infection', we associate the inhalation of 1 quanta i.e. a 63% probability of being infected, with the end-point 'being infected'. However, there is still a chance of being infected and The main limitation of this work is the assumed quanta generation rates because a reliable quanta generation rate distribution for COVID-19 is not known. However, the selected quanta generation rates used in the analysis are representative of a wide range of quanta generation rates suggested from, or derived from, data for a number of COVID-19 transmission events reported in literature (see Supplementary Material Section S1). Furthermore, the emission rate of quanta from a given source is likely to vary during the flight as the index patient occasionally engages in speech rather than simply respiring and this is likely to be dependent on the nature of the passenger, e.g. family groups, vacationers, business traveller. It is also noted that the new SARS-CoV-2 variant B1.1.7 [23] , reported in over 55 countries [24] , is thought to be between 40% and 70% more transmissible [23] and so quanta generation rates associated with these strains are likely to be significantly greater than previously reported for the original SARS-CoV-2 (See Section S1.5 in the Supplementary Material). The model input data derived from the TRANSCOM experiments [15] also has a number of limitations.",

Furthermore, quanta emission rates can be defined based on the index patient's activity at the time of secondary infection e.g., breathing, talking, coughing, and exertion level. This approach allows engineers and epidemiologists to prospectively and retrospectively estimate contagion based on quanta emission and ventilation conditions within enclosed spaces. Marcus et al. [14] used the Wells-Riley model together with a Multizone Markov Model to estimate the required flight-time to cause an infection. The work concluded that the time to infection is very large provided masks are worn, and so the likelihood of inflight transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is minimal, supporting the claim made in the experimental report [15]. However, the use of time to infection, as an assessment criterion, is overly simplistic and liable to be misunderstood. The probability determined by the Wells-Riley model represents the proportion of the population or the probability that an individual is likely to be infected by the given inhaled quanta. Therefore, rather than simply identifying the time to infection, the probability of infection associated with an exposure time should be identified when assessing the potential for inflight transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Method Using experimental data for the B777-200 aircraft [15] and a modified Wells-Riley model, we estimate the inflight infection probability (assuming aerosol transmission) within the MID-AFT (economy class) and FWD (business class) sections of the aircraft. These cabin sections represent the areas with the highest and lowest experimentally derived values of maximum aerosol BZP respectively.",

Furthermore, \"time to infection\" does not give an idea of the expected number of infections that could be caused by an index patient. Exposure time and infection probability for the maximum BZP data in the MID-AFT section for the Severe Scenario For the most extreme case considered, involving a 12-hour flight in which the passengers were not wearing masks, and for the Severe Scenario, the average probability of infection within the highest risk zone (MID-AFT) is 10.8%. With such a relatively low probability of infection it may be considered unlikely that an individual would be infected, unless they were in the seat of maximum exposure, in which case they would have a 99.6% probability of being infected. Furthermore, if all the passengers wore low efficiency masks for the entire 12-hour flight, this reduces the average probability of infection to 6.5% and this is further reduced to 2.8% if all the passengers are wearing high efficiency masks. However, if these probabilities are applied to all the passengers (75) in the MID-AFT section, then the expected number of secondary infected cases is 8.1 with no masks and 1.3 when high efficiency masks are used. For the Medium and Mild scenarios the expected number of secondary infections is 2.1 and 0.6 respectively without masks and 0.3 and 0.1 respectively with high efficiency masks. This analysis suggests that multiple secondary infections can occur on-board aircraft, even though the passengers are protected with high ventilation rates and HEPA filters, although mask wearing helps to mitigate this risk. On average, the high/low efficiency masks reduce the average infection probability by 86%/47% and the maximum infection probability by 73%/32%. Thus the wearing of masks by all passengers and crew should be considered an essential requirement for all flights and should be worn by all who can wear them at all times. However, even with the wearing of masks there is still a non-negligible probability of meal service, increases the average probability of infection by as much as 59%, compared to the situation where the mask is worn continuously. The viral dose received is over 8 times greater when no one wears a mask compared to when everyone wears a high efficiency mask. Furthermore, the viral dose received is almost 3 times greater when no one wears a mask compared to the case where either the susceptible or infected subject wears a high efficiency mask. In the Severe Scenario with high efficiency masks, removing the mask for 1-hour results in 2.1 of the 75 passengers seated in the MID-AFT section being infected, an increase of 0.8 passengers compared to the case where masks are worn throughout. If it is necessary to provide a meal service, airlines should keep the mealtime to a minimum and consider alternating the meal service so that only half the passengers (that are non-neighbouring) within a seat row are fed at any one time. In this way, the passengers either side of the susceptible passenger currently being fed are wearing masks, thus reducing the impact on the maximum infection probability associated with the passenger adjacent to the index passenger.Clearly, this will increase the time required for the meal service but will reduce the maximum infection probability. During the staggered meal service, a susceptible passenger seated next to an index passenger will receive a viral dose approximately 62% (assuming high efficiency masks) of what they would have received during the usual simultaneous meal service.There is also a clear class difference in the infection probabilities with the FWD (business class) section having much lower infection probabilities than the MID-AFT (economy class) section, which has the highest. The FWD average infection probability is about one third for the Mild and Medium scenarios and 42% for the severe scenario of the MID-AFT probabilities. These differences are probably due to a number of factors such as lower resulting in greater seating separations and the business class seat geometry possibly offering greater shielding. It is also not clear if the ventilation rate in the business class cabin section is greater than that in the economy class section.",

A main conclusion of this study was that the aerosol exposure risk is minimal even during long-haul flights.A fundamental limitation of the analysis presented by Silcott et al.[15] is that simply presenting the reduction in aerosol concentration, even though it is significant, does not quantify the impact this may have on the probability of infection. For respiratory airborne infectious pathogens, the virion emission rate, the size distribution of respiratory particles carrying the virions, the infectivity of emitted virions, their deposition location within the respiratory tract and the dose required to cause infection are usually used to analyse disease transmission.
