            "text": "Glycyrrhizin (GLY), a derivative of the licorice root, is used in traditional medicine in many parts of the world due to its nutritional and therapeutic properties (Isbrucker and Burdock, 2006) . Structurally, it is a triterpenoid saponin with anti-inflammatory properties (Yang et al., 2017) . In this regard, GLY directly binds to high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) and inhibits its chemoattractant and mitogenic activity (Mollica et al., 2007) . GLY is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and used clinically to treat patients with viral hepatitis C (Arase et al., 1997) , severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (Sinha et al., 2020) , and HIV (Hattori et al., 1989) . Studies from our laboratory have shown the effectiveness of GLY against Pseudomonas aeruginosa keratitis using a cytotoxic strain 19660 (ATCC) (Ekanayaka et al., 2016) , a non-ocular multidrug-resistant clinical isolate MDR9 (Hazlett et al., 2019) , and an ocular non-cytotoxic clinical isolate, KEI 1025 (Ekanayaka et al., 2016; Ekanayaka et al., 2018) . In addition, we showed that GLY enhanced the efficacy of the antibiotic, tobramycin, in a KEI 1025-induced model of bacterial keratitis (Ekanayaka et al., 2018) . GLY also enhanced the effects of ciprofloxacin to which MDR9 is resistant, by reducing the minimum inhibitory concentration twofold (Hazlett et al., 2019) . Others also showed that GLY enhances bioavailability of antibiotics against P. aeruginosa in vitro (Chakotiya et al., 2016) . Despite the fact that all of these studies have shown effectiveness of GLY alone and in combination with antibiotics to treat keratitis, we have not examined if GLY induces adverse events in the cornea at acidic pH, which we used for those studies. Neither was pH considered in other animal models, in which GLY is protective, including in lung (Ni et al., 2011) and cerebral ischemic (Gong et al., 2014) injuries, colitis (Liu et al., 2011) , and sepsis (Wang et al., 2013) . In contrast, in other studies, ophthalmic solutions containing GLY as nanocarriers at neutral pH were used to treat Staphylococcus aureus infection in rabbits (Song et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021) and corneal wounds in diabetic mice (Hou et al., 2021a) . In this regard, pilot clinical studies have investigated the efficacy of GLY in ophthalmic solutions (all at neutral pH) to treat blepharitis (Mencucci et al., 2013) and dry eye disease (Burillon et al., 2018) .",

Images were processed, and green pseudo-colored images were generated using Adobe Photoshop CS6 version 13.0. To quantitate nerve density, images in tiff format (taken on the Leica SP8 confocal microscope) were converted into binary images using Image J version 1.49b software.

            "text": "Figures 3A-C show fluorescein-stained normal corneas at 6 h after wounding. GLY application at both acidic ( Figure 3B ) and neutral ( Figure 3C ) pH vs. PBS ( Figure 3A ) showed fluorescein staining, at 6 h after wounding, indicating delayed wound closure. All corneas that received PBS after wounding had closed at this time. By 24 h after wounding, no differences in wound closure among the three groups was detected, and all corneas appeared similar (data not shown). Figure 3D shows clinical scores of KEI 1025-infected mice after treatment with acidic or neutral pH GLY vs. PBS. As in the past work (Ekanayaka et al., 2018) , treatment began at 6 h after infection. Significantly less corneal disease with lower clinical scores was seen after application of either acidic (p < 0.01, p < 0.001) or neutral GLY (p < 0.001, p < 0.001) vs. PBS at 3 and 5 days p.i., respectively. Photographs taken with a slit lamp of representative eyes from PBS ( Figure 3E ), acidic ( Figure 3F ), and neutral ( Figure 3G ) GLY-treated mice at 5 days p.i. show that the majority of eyes treated with PBS had perforated and opacity was pronounced. No perforation was observed in the GLY-treated eyes that also exhibited reduced opacity confined to the central cornea with hypopyon visible in the anterior chamber. To rule out the possibility that the pH of GLY was responsible for bacterial killing, PBS was adjusted to neutral or acidic pH. Viable bacterial plate count ( Figure 4A ) showed no significant differences between acidic or neutral GLY vs. either PBS group at 3 days p.i. By 5 days p.i., viable bacterial counts were significantly reduced in both acidic (p < 0.001) and neutral (p < 0.001) GLY vs. either PBS groups. At this time, although both neutral and acidic GLY reduced plate count significantly compared to controls, neutral (p < 0.001) vs. acidic GLY treatment was significantly less (about 1.5 logs). There was no difference in plate count between acidic or neutral pH PBS. MPO activity ( Figure 4B ) did not differ between acidic or neutral GLY vs. the PBS-treated group at 3 days p.i. However, by 5 days p.i., both acidic (p < 0.001) and neutral (p < 0.001) GLY vs. PBS reduced MPO similarly when compared to PBS. Figure 5 shows the relative mRNA levels for HMGB1 ( Figure 5A ), TNF-a ( Figure 5B ), IL-1b ( Figure 5C ), and CXCL2 ( Figure 5D ) at 5 days after KEI 1025 infection and treatment with acidic or neutral GLY or PBS. Acidic and neutral GLY vs. PBS treatment significantly reduced mRNA levels for HMGB1 (acidic p < 0.001, neutral p < 0.05), TNF-a (acidic p < 0.05, neutral p < 0.001), IL-1b (p < 0.05 for both) and CXCL2 (acidic p < 0.01, neutral p < 0.001). Only for TNF-a mRNA levels, neutral vs. acidic GLY treatment was significantly more effective (p < 0.05, Figure 5B ). Protein analysis ( Figure 6) showed no significant differences in HMGB1 ( Figure 6A ), TNF-a ( Figure 6B) , and CXCL2 ( Figure 6C ) levels between PBS or acidic or neutral GLY-treated groups at 3 days p.i. However, at 5 days p.i., protein levels were significantly reduced in both acidic and neutral GLY vs. PBS groups for HMGB1 (p < 0.001 for both), TNF-a (acidic, p < 0.01, neutral p < 0.05), and CXCL2 (p < 0.05 for both).",

            "text": "GLY is FDA approved (Omar et al., 2012) and has both anti-inflammatory and antimicrobial properties (Asl and Hosseinzadeh, 2008) . For example, it has shown efficacy when used topically in the clinic to treat patients with blepharitis (Mencucci et al., 2013) and dry eye (Burillon et al., 2018) disease. These two clinical pilot studies, one using a 5% GLY ophthalmic solution to treat blepharitis and the other using eye drops containing 2.5% GLY to treat dry eye patients, showed that GLY at a neutralized pH was well tolerated in both healthy volunteers (normal) and in patients. Because patients were being treated, only non-invasive approaches could be used to assess any adverse consequences of GLY use. However, animal models provide the ability when scientifically and humanely justified, to use invasive and non-invasive testing. Thus, to determine whether the pH of GLY correlated with adverse ocular changes, we tested its effect at acidic and neutral pH on the normal, uninfected ocular surface. Examining the conjunctiva, we observed a significant reduction in bulbar conjunctival goblet cells after 4 days of either acidic or neutral GLY vs. PBS application. Unfortunately, there is very little data on the effects of GLY on goblet cells in the normal eye at either pH. However, it was reported in a mouse model of goblet cell hyperplasia in the airway epithelium that GLY (pH not indicated) reduced goblet cells (Nishimoto et al., 2010) . GLY also decreased mucus production by attenuating mRNA and protein levels of MUC5AC and inhibiting MUC5AC gene transcription (Nishimoto et al., 2010) . Similarly, another study using a mouse model of asthma showed that GLY (pH not specified) administered via orogastric gavage reduced goblet cells in the trachea (Hocaoglu et al., 2011) . These are all consistent with the data reported herein. Our data on corneal nerve density used the normal, unwounded cornea treated with GLY at either pH and showed no differences when compared with PBS treatment. These data differ from numerous studies showing that GLY is neuroprotective; however, all of those studies used models of diseases. For example, examining wound healing in the diabetic mouse cornea, a dipotassium salt of GLY (pH not specified) significantly increased subbasal nerve density (Hou et al., 2021b) . Additionally, in the diabetic mouse cornea, a combination of GLY as a nanocarrier encapsulating genistein (pH 7.2) showed increased subbasal nerve density and accelerated corneal nerve regeneration (Hou et al., 2021a) .

In contrast, in diabetic corneas that received a 2-mm trephine wound, GLY promoted regeneration of the corneal epithelium (Hou et al., 2021b) , and closure was observed at 24 h vs. control (Zhou et al., 2020; Hou et al., 2021b) . In the skin, licorice containing creams are commonly used to treat wounds (Mostafa et al., 2004 , Ciganovic\u0301et al., 2019 . In this regard, studies in rabbits (Zaki et al., 2005) and guinea pigs (Hanafi et al., 2018) receiving surgical blade induced full-thickness wounds showed that 10% licorice cream provided more rapid healing than control treatment (12-14 days). Our data are disparate from these studies, but we hypothesize that this may be due to various factors such as species and/or tissue differences, the type of wounding (depth and breadth), dose of GLY, duration of application, and the time points at which wound healing was examined. For example, in our study, the wound consisted of three 1-mm scratches to the central cornea using a 25 5/8 gauge needle, which penetrated just below the epithelial basal lamina into the superficial stroma, unlike the large sized wound of the 2mm trephined cornea. In addition, we tested corneal wound healing earlier after GLY application. Other studies used much larger areas of wounding, including a 2-mm trephine wound (cornea) or full thickness skin wounds (rabbit and guinea pig) and looked at wound healing at 24 h or days later.",

Using a non-drug-resistant clinical isolate KEI 1025, we found that GLY-treated corneas responded similarly in that GLY was protective, (e.g., reducing clinical score and MPO). However, unexpectedly, we found that neutral pH GLY optimally reduced plate count over acidic treatment. Our data parallels other studies in a rabbit model of S. aureus infection, where protection was shown after topical GLY-based nanodrug formulations containing thymol (pH 7.4) (Song et al., 2020) , or hesperetin (pH 7.0) (Zhang et al., 2021) .",
