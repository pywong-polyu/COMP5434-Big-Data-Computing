Each question has a 0-to 10-point severity score. 4 Widespread Pain Index, Symptom Severity Scale, and Polysymptomatic Distress Scale were contained in Wolfe and colleagues' fibromyalgia diagnostic criteria. 3 Small-Fiber Symptom Survey measured small-fiber neuropathy symptom burden. 5 COMPASS-31 assessed dysautonomia symptoms in 6 domains: orthostatic intolerance, vasomotor, secretomotor, gastrointestinal, bladder, and pupillomotor. 6 Patient Health Questionnaire-9 objectivized depression severity 7 ; the General Anxiety Disorder-7 questionnaire was used for anxiety assessment, 8 and the EuroQol test measured generic quality of life. 9 The prepandemic fibromyalgia protocol did not require any therapeutic modification. Five months after the COVID-19 epidemic onset and during the in-house lockdown period, patients were contacted and asked to fill out the same questionnaires.

COVID-19 pandemic also provoked economic hardship and physical exercise restrictions. 2 These forced lifestyle changes can negatively affect stress-related illness such as fibromyalgia.

The sympathetic nervous system is our main stress-response force. Diverse heart rate variability analyses demonstrated that fibromyalgia patients have time and frequency domain changes consistent with relentless sympathetic hyperactivity. This sympathetic overdrive may explain sleeping difficulties. 11 Fibromyalgia patients have also sympathetic hyporeactivity to different stressors, theoretically explaining ongoing fatigue. 12 Additional environmental stressors such as COVID-19 lockdown-associated lifestyle changes could worsen sympathetic nervous system dysfunction. Contrary to what happens normally, fibromyalgia patients have norepinephrine-evoked pain. 13 The relationship between stress and disease severity in no way rules out other pathogenetic mechanisms for fibromyalgia. Discussion of such pathways is beyond the scope of this brief communication.",
