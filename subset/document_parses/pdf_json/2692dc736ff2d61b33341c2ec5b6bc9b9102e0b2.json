Mass quarantine had been implemented all around China which could influence the psychological status of patients with memory disorders and their caregivers. Aim To investigate the psychological impact of mass quarantine on patients with memory disorders and their caregivers in China. Methods We completed a cross-sectional study in 787 patients and their caregivers registered from 2010 to 2019 in Memory Clinic, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, by telephone interviews. The performance in neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPSs), sleep, nutrition, chronic diseases of patients, and the burden of care, anxiety and depression of caregivers was assessed by six assessment scales (MNA-SF, PSQI, NPI, RSS, PHQ-9 and GAD-7). Results Only 68 (8.6%) patients worried about the outbreak of COVID-19. The prevalence of NPSs among all subjects was nearly 60.0%. Approximately 50.0% of the caregivers reported distress. More than 70.0% of patients remained stable in NPSs. However, anxiety, depression, aberrant motor disorder and delusion were exacerbated (22.9%, 18.6%, 17.1% and 16.8%, respectively). Appetite and eating disorder led alleviation rate by 25.8% while disappearing rate of agitation led by 5.8%. 7.5% of caregivers manifested depressive symptoms while 4.9% expressed anxiety symptoms, and 40.8% showed care burden. The coefficients of RSS and PHQ-9, RSS and GAD-7, RSS and NPI-D, PHQ-9 and GAD-7 were 0.7, 0.5, 0.5 and 0.6, respectively (p < 0.01). Conclusion Changes in NPSs during COVID-19 were observed in some patients with memory disorders and their caregivers, and adherence to medication contributed to the stabilization of NPSs.",

However, based on the fact that it was the first time for Chongqing even for China to implement mass quarantine and sudden changes were immediately occurred to all citizens, the impact on the elderly with cognitive impairment during this particular period was unknown.",

This is probably because the elderly with cognitive impairment usually show decreased perception of the surroundings; therefore, patients seldom take the initiative to judge and analyze the epidemic situation, which stabilized their mental symptoms.

This may due to the diverse severity and complexity of COVID-19 outbreaks in different countries and regions, as well as the various countermeasures that were against for. The rest of the aggravated NPSs are mainly psychotic-like symptoms, including delusion, hallucination, agitation, and AMD, that may account for changes in family care arrangements and lifestyle alterations. Because of COVID-19 outbreak, some family members were unable to visit as frequently as before, patients were forced to change to new care environment, and needed additional \"running-in\" time. Moreover, irregular home life also leads to behavioral problems. During the quarantine, patients' life and normal rest may get irregular due to restrictions on outdoor activities. Besides, increased personal protective measures, such as washing hands frequently and wearing masks, could lead to agitation and irritability because of uncooperative attitude. Previous researches around China have shown the prevalence of depression (0.5-3.4%) and anxiety (5.1-5.6%) in the general population [25] [26] [27] .

First, the elderly with memory disorders during the epidemic are preferable to be quarantined at home because they are at high risk for severe cases of COVID-19, and quarantine can help reduce the risk of infection [28] . Second, elderly patients could obtain effective medical consultation and assistance via telephone and internet by physicians during the quarantine [29, 30] . Third, multimode medicine purchase channels should be established due to home quarantine. Fourth, family recreational activities are recommended. It contributes to the maintenance of mental status and sleep routine of the patients [31] . Activities like cognitive games, nostalgic talks, indoor exercises, and housework are quite practicable, like playing mahjong, cards or chess, chatting on old times, reading books for them, listening to music, or doing Tai Chi etc. would be beneficial. Finally, diet and nutrition are important for the elderly to strengthen immunity during the epidemic of contagious disease. Eating several small meals and adoption of balanced diet are good strategy for the elderly with memory disorders [32, 33] .",

In addition, the sample size was not large enough due to time limitation and single clinic. However, our memory clinic is an epitome of patients with memory disorders and their families in the country; therefore, the present research is representative. In addition, this is a crosssectional study, there are some limitations in revealed psychological impact on patients with memory disorders and their caregivers during COVID-19. To investigate the impact further, a prospective cohort study is under way.",

The epidemic of COVID-19 and its quarantine have brought new challenges to patients with memory disorders and their caregivers, especially in dealing with neuropsychiatric symptoms. During mass quarantine for COVID-19, accompanying time and its quality from caregivers, online medical service, and adherence to medication significantly contributed to the stabilization of the elderly with memory disorders and their care burden. Based on above, we hope that our work can provide scientific reference for improving the management of patients with cognitive impairment in stress events like COVID-19.",
