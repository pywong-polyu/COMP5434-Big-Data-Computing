Certainly, the social distancing and the restrictions applied during the quarantine period have upset the habits of workers and students. In this regard, the National Bureau of Economic Research reported that between February and May 2020 30% of American workers switched to smart working (working from home WFH) and that 10% were fired. This drastic change cause an increase in sedentary lifestyle [11] . To assess the impact of COVID-19 in the student population, a group of researchers led by Aucejo conducted an analysis of 1500 students from the University of Arizona. This investigation revealed that 13% of students have delayed graduation, 40% have lost a job, internship, or job offer, and 29% expect to earn less at age 35 [12] . In addition, in the United States, all clinical learning has been suspended indefinitely in accordance with the recommendations of the American Association of Medical Colleges (AAMC) of 17 March 2020. This change forced medical students to move away from hospitals and follow virtual classes. A study by Byrnes et al. highlighted the students' concerns regarding their preparation and future career [13] .",

Some studies have revealed that people have increased the consumption of unhealthy foods, eating out of control, more snacks between meals and an overall greater number of main meals. [14] [15] [16] . On the other hand, a study conducted in Spain highlighted the beneficial effects that the Mediterranean diet had on the population. In fact, the increase in the consumption of fruit, vegetables or legumes and a lower intake of red meat, alcohol, fried or sweet foods than usual, could have a positive impact on the prevention of chronic diseases and complications related to COVID-19 [17] . The quarantine period also had different effects on sports practice in the various countries [18] [19] [20] . In one Bavarian population, an increase in physical activity was reported during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a large-scale blockade was not imposed in Bavaria like those in France, Spain and Italy. Conversely, Germany allowed outdoor exercise, but only alone or with other family members [21] .",

In addition, 78.2% of respondents were students, 11.0% administrative staff and 10.8% were faculty members. Table 1 shows the characteristics of the population and its stratification by gender. We found statistically significant differences based on gender regarding the following variables: age, weight before and during quarantine, height, BMI before quarantine and current. In particular, during the quarantine both females and males underwent weight gain (see Table 1 ); in two months the mean weight gain was 0.5 and 0.7 kg respectively in females and males; as a consequence, both females and males reported an increase in BMI equal to 0.2 while maintaining a normal weight condition. Furthermore, males consumed more cigarettes than females (see Table 1 ).

Furthermore, a survey conducted by thirty-five research organizations from Europe, North-Africa, Western Asia and the Americas reported that food consumption and meal patterns (the type of food, eating out of control, snacks between meals, number of main meals) were more unhealthy during confinement, with only alcohol binge drinking decreasing significantly [14] . Contrariwise, COVID-19 confinement in Spain has led to the adoption of healthier dietary behaviors in the studied population, as reflected by a higher adherence to the Mediterranean Diet [16] . Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic may have changed the food choice determinants of Polish adolescents, as it may have increased the importance of health and weight control, but reduced the role of mood and sensory appeal. This may be interpreted as positive changes promoting the uptake of a better diet than in the period before the pandemic [12] .",
