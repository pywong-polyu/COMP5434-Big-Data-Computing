The ectodomain of the F protein is known to have a major impact on fusion, and several reports have also indicated the role of the cytoplasmic tail (CT) in viral entry, F protein cleavage, and fusion, which are regulated by specific motifs. We found a highly conserved tyrosine residue located in the YLMY motif. The tyrosine residues at positions 524 and 527 have different roles in viral replication and pathogenicity and are associated with F protein intracellular processing. Tyrosine residues mutants affect the transportation of the F protein from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi apparatus, resulting in different cleavage efficiencies. F protein is subsequently transported to the cell surface where it participates in viral budding, a process closely related to the distinctions in pathogenicity caused by the tyrosine residues. In addition, the different mutations all led to a hypofusogenic phenotype. We believe that the highly conserved tyrosine residue of the YLMY motif uses a similar mechanism to the tyrosine-based motif (YXXU) to regulate F protein transport and thus affect viral replication and pathogenicity.",

            "text": "IMPORTANCE The amino-terminal cytoplasmic domains of paramyxovirus fusion glycoproteins include trafficking signals that influence protein processing and cell surface expression. This study clarified that tyrosine residues at different positions in the YLMY motif in the cytoplasmic region of the F protein regulate F protein transportation, thereby affecting viral replication and pathogenicity. This study has increased our understanding of how NDV virulence is mediated by the F protein and provides a fresh perspective on the role of CT in the virus's life cycle. This information may be useful in the development of NDV as an effective vaccine vector and oncolytic agent. KEYWORDS NDV, fusion protein, cytoplasmic tail, transporting and processing, cell surface, virus budding, virulence N ewcastle disease (ND) is caused by the Newcastle disease virus (NDV), a highly epidemic and prevalent pathogen among avian species that causes high economic losses in worldwide poultry industries (1) . NDV is a nonsegmented, single-stranded, negative-sense RNA virus (2) . The two surface glycoproteins of NDV, the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) protein and the fusion (F) protein, interact with each other to accomplish viral entry (3) . The F glycoprotein allows entry of the viral genome into the cytoplasm by fusing the viral membrane to the plasma membrane (4) . Before participating in fusion, the F protein is initially synthesized by NDV as the inactive precursor F 0 , which has to be cleaved to become the disulfide-bonded F 1 protein and F 2 active complexed form (5) . The F 1 subunit contains two hydrophobic regions, the fusion peptide (FP), which resides at the new N-terminal after cleavage, and the transmembrane (TM) domain, which anchors the protein to the membrane of a virus or target cell, as well as two heptad repeat (HR) regions, HRA and HRB (6) . All of these protein architectures are ectodomains, which are known to be important structural features of the F protein ectodomain. The FP initiates the process of fusion by penetrating the infected cell (7) , triggering the HR1 and HR2 domains to undergo conformational changes that are reportedly necessarily for fusion (8) . Thus, the FP may affect viral infectivity, replication, and pathogenicity (9) . Several studies have shown that the TM domain also functions in protein folding, stability, and fusion (10, 11) . Of these features belonging to ectodomains, the role of the cytoplasmic tail (CT) is the least well-understood.",

Mutational studies into human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1), in which truncations and deletions of various lengths were introduced into the CT of gp41, have indicated that this region is important for infectivity and is associated with the incorporation of glycoproteins into virus particles (12) (13) (14) . Deletion of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein CT increased the virus's infectivity in pseudovirus neutralization assays (15) . Studies on other paramyxoviruses, including simian virus (SV5), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), measles virus (MV), and parainfluenza virus 2 (PIV2), reported that the role of the F protein cytoplasmic domain in fusion varies with the F protein. Deletion of the entire domain from the PIV2 F protein and the MV F protein had no effect on cell surface expression and fusion activity, while F protein deletion from PIV3 affected protein folding and surface expression. In addition, the CT domain also influences the folding of the F protein ectodomain. Deletion of the carboxyl-terminal half of the NDV F protein cytoplasmic domain results in defective syncytium formation. The domain of the SV5 F protein is involved in later stages of fusion related to pore expansion (8, (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) .",

            "text": "Paramyxovirus glycoproteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and trafficked through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane. Proper trafficking is needed for their incorporation into budding virions or fusion activity. Substantial amounts of evidence indicate CT has an important role in this process, and trafficking of viral glycoproteins has been demonstrated to involve certain motifs in CT, especially the Y-X-X-aliphatic/aromatic consensus motif. For instance, the CTs of Nipah (NiV) and Hendra (HeV) F proteins contain a YXXU motif that is required for the internalization of the protein by cells. NiV F proteins expressed from plasmid DNA are located primarily at the basolateral surface of epithelial cells, and this location depends on the YXXU motif in the CT of NiV F, and mutation of the Sendai virus TYTLE motif in the CT of the fusion protein deeply affects viral assembly and particle production (21) (22) (23) . Additionally, such tyrosine-based motifs are often associated with endocytosis signals. Reportedly, replacement of tyrosine, analogous to the substitutions shown to abolish HIV polarized budding in epithelial cells, results in decreased endocytosis and the accumulation of lymphocytes at the surface of cells infected with either HIV-1 or simian immunodeficiency virus (24, 25) . Most S proteins of alphacoronaviruses and gammacoronaviruses contain this motif in their CT. A previous study demonstrated that the YXXU motif is responsible for the intracellular retention but not the endocytosis of the TGEV S protein by cells (26, 27) . The sorting signal is recognized by adaptor protein (AP) complexes (28) (29) (30) , and selection of cargo proteins by the AP complexes requires the recognition of specific motifs found in the CT of transmembrane cargo. Recognition of the YXXU signals within retroviral structural proteins by AP2M1 and AP1M1 has been shown to be involved in mediating the intracellular trafficking of the Gag protein and infectious virus production and release (31) . The YXXU motif also mediates HCV core binding to AP2M1 and HCV assembly (32, 33) .",

The effect of tyrosine residues on F protein intracellular processing was analyzed by an Endo H and glycopeptidase F digestion assays. By exploring the connection between F protein cell-surface expression and subsequent viral budding, we further clarified the specific mechanisms of how the tyrosine residue regulates viral replication and pathogenicity. This is a new discovery of a highly conserved tyrosine residue in the YLMY motif that also appears in known typical YXXU motifs yet regulates viral replication and pathogenicity by affecting F protein expression on the cell surface.

NDV can enter host cells through the fusion of its capsule membrane to the cytoplasmic membrane, but it can also use endocytosis to infect the host directly, especially clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME), which largely depends on a tyrosine-based consensus motif present in the CT of the F protein. To identify whether changes in the YLMY motif affect NDV's ability to use CME to enter cells, a specific chemical inhibitor (chlorpromazine, CPZ) was used to block the CME pathway. A cytotoxicity test showed that 10 mM CPZ had no effect on the viability of the BSR-T7/5 cells (Fig. 4A ). The internalization rates of the mutants after CPZ treatment were quantified by qRT-PCR and Western blotting at 6 hpi. The qRT-PCR results showed that NDV invasion was inhibited by CPZ, by approximately 15%-25%, but there was no significant difference between the parental and mutant viruses (Fig. 4B) . The same results were observed on the Western blot (Fig. 4C) . Collectively, these data suggest that NDV can enter cells through the CME pathway, but the tyrosine residue of the YLMY motif does not function in CME. YLMY motif tyrosine residue mutants leads to discrepancies in F protein expression but confers hypofusogenic phenotypes. To investigate the effects of changes in tyrosine residues on F protein synthesis, the mutant viruses were used to infect BSR-T7/5 cells, and the results analyzed by Western blotting. The data show that F protein expression of rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA was higher than that of rSG 10 *, especially in the early stages of viral infection, while the same expression by rSG10*-FY524A was continuously lower than that of rSG 10 * during the whole infection. The same trend was observed for HN protein, meaning the function of the YLMY motif is not specific to the F protein (Fig. 5A) . The F protein facilitates viral entry into cells by fusion. To investigate the significance of tyrosine changes in F-protein-mediated cell-cell fusion, we measured the fusion indices (number and size) of rSG 10 * and mutant viruses with Vero cells. The syncytia induced by the viruses with YLMY motif changes were markedly smaller and fewer (approximately 50% decrease, respectively) than those induced by rSG 10 * (Fig. 5B ). This indicated that the tyrosine residues of the YLMY motif modulate F protein expression and cell-cell fusion.",

The NDV F protein is synthesized in the ER and then activated by proteolytic cleavage during transport within the Golgi organelle. Given the above results, we wanted to uncover whether and where those mutants have some discrepancy in F protein transportation and intracellular processing. The cleavage efficiency was measured by the ratio of F 1 to F 0 . According to the results, the F 0 protein was expressed and cleaved to F 1 -F 2 , but the extent of cleavage varied among the YLMY mutant viruses. In the rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA mutants, there was a higher percentage of F 1 /F 0, especially in the early infection stages, indicating the enhanced processivity of the F protein. While in the rSG10*-FY524A, both F 0 and F 1 were detectable; however, the cleavage efficiency (F 1 /F 0 ) was lower than rSG10* (Fig. 6A ). Given that this process happens in the Golgi, we used the Endo H enzyme, which can only digest the glycoprotein trapped in the ER and cannot digest protein in the Golgi, and peptide N-glycosidase F (PNGase F) to compare the glycan status of the mutants. The glycosylated precursors of all the virus genotypes shifted by a similar kDa of protein bands when treated with Endo H or PNGase F, suggesting that all the virus precursors contained similar protein modifications, but a difference in the processing time was seen. The results showed that, at 24 hpi, the Endo H-resistant protein band could still be detected for rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA mutants, while only the Endo H-sensitive protein band was recorded for rSG 10 *(red arrow). As for rSG10*-FY524A, there were no obvious bands detected. At 36 hpi, the Endo H-resistant Golgi processed mature F protein band was prominent in most viruses except for rSG10*-FY524A, which only showed a slight Endo H-sensitive protein band (red arrow, Fig. 6B ). The results revealed that the tyrosine 527 mutant enabled the F protein to be rapidly transported to the Golgi, thereby promoting the processivity of the F protein, especially in the early infection stage.

After synthesis in the ER and processing in the Golgi, the F protein is trafficked to the plasma membrane; thus, we wanted to understand the specific expression pattern of F protein on the cell surface. First, we detected the dynamic changes in F protein expression on the cell surface during infection using Western blotting. The results indicated that the F proteins of the mutants were all transported and assembled at the cell surface but to different degrees of success. The rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA mutants induced significantly more F protein expression at the cell surface compared with rSG 10 *, but the intracellular expression levels were similar. In comparison, the cell surface expression of the rSG10*-FY524A F protein was quite low (Fig. 7A ). We next determined the level of F protein expression at the cellular membrane by flow cytometry. The virus infection efficiency was quantified as the percentage of F-positive cells, and F protein expression on the cell membrane was measured by the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI). The cell surface expression levels varied significantly among the YLMY motif mutants, despite the relatively constant level of F protein-positive cells, which is consistent with the trend shown by the Western blotting results (Fig. 7B) . Together, these results show that tyrosine 527 mutant promotes the transportation of the intracellular synthesized F protein to the cell surface and its prominent expression, but this ability was weakened by tyrosine 524 mutant. The budding procession of the YLMY motif tyrosine residue mutants. Given the previous results, the different tyrosine sites of the YLMY motif mutants led to differences in the expression of F protein on the cell membrane. Previous pathogenicity experiments also proved that the position of tyrosine has different regulatory effects on virus pathogenicity. We speculated whether differences in F protein expression on the cell membrane surface regulate virus pathogenicity through some mechanism. Based on previous research, the viral glycoprotein is believed to cluster within lipid raft membranes to participate in budding, and the process is directed by its CT. We hypothesized that the YLMY motif mutants caused the difference in F protein expressed in the region of the cell surface where the lipid rafts are concentrated and subsequently participated in the virus budding process. To verify our assumptions, we first aimed to understand the role of the YLMY motif in virus budding. All viruses were assessed for FIG 6 The intracellular processing of the F protein of YLMY motif tyrosine residue mutants. (A) The effect of critical tyrosine residues on F protein cleavage efficiency. The cleavage efficiency was measured by the ratio of F 1 to F 0 . (B) Analysis of the difference in YLMY tyrosine residue mutant processing with Endo H and PNGase F digestion. Mutants were used to infect BSR-T7/5 cells, and protein was collected as described above. The next steps followed the Endo H and PNGase F kit instructions. Red arrows point to lighter F protein bands. Each column and error bar represent the mean 6 SD for three independent experiments. whole-cell expression by Western blotting, and the levels of protein incorporated into viral particles were determined by sucrose cushion ultracentrifugation. The results showed that rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA had similar NP and F protein expression levels in the cell lysate to rSG 10 * but obviously higher levels in the supernatant. Owing to the low protein expression of rSG10*-FY524A, it was difficult to detect the bands corresponding to the virions, and we were not sure of the function of tyrosine 524 in viral budding (Fig. 8A ). To rule out the effect of viral particle incompleteness, we tested the extracellular RNA levels of the NP and F proteins. A similar trend to protein expression was seen, and extracellular virus titers also demonstrated that the virus released into the supernatant existed in a complete and infectious form. Additionally, there were no obvious differences between rSG10*-FY527A, rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA, and rSG 10 * in their intracellular virus titers, although rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA were present at significantly higher extracellular levels, which means that the tyrosine 527 mutation indeed promoted later viral budding. For rSG10*-FY524A, both the intracellular and extracellular virus titers were significantly lower than those of rSG10*; therefore, we were unsure of whether tyrosine 524 played any role in viral budding (Fig. 8B) . To visualize the morphology of the virus particles, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out, and the mutants showed F protein spikes on their surface similar to those on rSG 10 *. Furthermore, the diameter of the viral particles was similar to those of rSG 10 * and was within the usual range for virions grown in other cell types (Fig. 8C) . Combined with the above results, this indicated that viral budding was affected by the YLMY motif, especially the residue at position 527.",

To rule out the rSG10*-FY527A mutation as a cause of the enhanced viral budding at the cost of reduced intercellular transmission, we conducted a plaque experiment, and the results were in line with our expectations, i.e., there was no difference in the diameter of the plaques (Fig. 8D) . Membrane lipid raft domains are thought to be sites of budding for NDV. Based on the above results, we speculated that the rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA mutants facilitate the transportation of the F protein to lipid rafts at the cell surface, which is beneficial for later viral budding. We used a kit designed to extract lipid rafts, and detected the amount of F protein expressed and bound to the rafts. The results showed no apparent F protein expression among the mutant viruses in whole cells. In terms of the amount of protein bound to the lipid rafts, rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA showed significantly more than rSG 10 * (Fig. 8E) . Collectively, the tyrosine 527 of YLMY mutant promoted F protein transportation to the cell surface, thereby increasing the amount of F protein bound to the lipid rafts and promoting postviral infection budding, while tyrosine 524 weakened this capability.",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated the roles of the CT of paramyxovirus glycoproteins in particle formation, membrane fusion, protein folding and oligomerization, and viral infectivity and replication. For NDV, mutations in the CT of the fusion glycoprotein depressed syncytium formation (34) . It is believed that the role of the glycoprotein CT in paramyxoviruses depends on specific amino acid sequences or signals. Tyrosinecontaining signals, especially YXXU in the CT of viral envelope glycoproteins, have been proven to be associated with those functions. Research has provided increasing evidence that mutagenesis of tyrosine motifs in the CT can influence viral fusion and infectivity (35) (36) (37) . In this study, we described a tyrosine-like motif, YLMY, and discovered its role in NDV replication, infectivity, and protein transportation. We compared the CT of the F protein among different genotypes of NDV and demonstrated that the YLMY motif is highly conserved, especially the tyrosine residues at positions 524 and 527. We evaluated the effects of YLMY tyrosine mutation on NDV replication and pathogenesis, and unexpectedly, found that tyrosine residues at different positions in YLMY have contrary effects on viral replication and pathogenicity. The rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA virus significantly promoted viral replication, protein expression and pathogenicity, while the rSG10*-FY524A resulted in the opposite. In the pathogenicity experiment, rSG10*-FY524A presented a similar viral load to rSG10* at 3 dpc and 5dpc, but viral RNA was barely detected in the target and other organ at 7 Cells were infected with mutants and cultured at 37\u00b0C with medium containing agarose. Plaques were identified using crystal violet staining. P values were calculated based on a two-tailed, unpaired t test (95% confidence levels). (E) Colocalization of F protein and lipid rafts. BSR-T7/5 cells were infected with rSG10* and YLMY mutants at 0.1 MOI, and protein was collected at 36 hpi. Cell lysates were subjected to Western blotting with the indicated protein antibodies. The F protein of cell lysate and lipid rafts were used to calculate the relative expression, which was normalized to rSG10*. dpc. This result might be a reasonable explanation why rSG10*-FY524A caused mild clinical symptoms and had a 100% survival rate. The commonly used vaccine strain La Sota could be detected only a few days after immunization just like rSG10*-FY524A, which means those viruses could not replicate well in the tissues. This difference also exists in bovine leukemia virus (BLV), which possesses three tyrosine motifs. Different motifs and positions are involved in unique regulation functions in syncytium formation, Env packaging, endocytosis, and membrane binding, which suggests this motif regulates viral lifecycles through different mechanisms (38) .",

We further investigated the role of the YLMY motif in F protein expression and fusion. The effect of this motif on F protein expression was in line with the trends shown in viral NP expression, but all mutants showed a hypofusogenic phenotype, in contrast with the wild type (Fig. 5) . Virus-mediated cell-cell fusion is an extremely complicated process, especially for some paramyxoviruses that require two distinct proteins. The attachment protein binds to the receptor, while the fusion glycoprotein needs to undergo conformational changes that drive virus-cell membrane fusion and viral entry. The mutation of tyrosine in the three YXXL sequences of the BLV transmembrane protein all resulted in the excessive expression of protein on the cell surface, but only the first two mutations conveyed an increased fusion ability, thus there was no direct correspondence between expression level and fusion ability. This phenomenon also can be found in the DIII-DI linker region of the NDV fusion protein; the L295A mutant showed almost abolished fusion activity, even though there was a similar level of cell surface expression. Mutations G377S, A378D, and L379A in the DI-DII linker of the F protein induced much larger syncytia than the wild type, but with F protein expression at the cell surface comparable to that of the wild type. A possible explanation is that this mutant may have had an influence on the interaction between HN and F (6, 39) . Further experiments are needed to ascertain whether a specific mechanism exists through which the YLMY motifs regulate F-mediated fusion.",

Because of the roles of CT in viral budding, we tested the effects of the YLMY motif in the process, and we found that rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA significantly promoted budding and did not impair virus particle integrity. Lipid rafts are regions where virus particles are assembled and released, and we further uncovered that the rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA mutations led to a significantly increased F protein concentration at the lipid rafts, resulting in improved virus budding that was ultimately reflected in the pathogenicity. The influence of YLMY mutations on virus budding is mainly caused by the process of F protein transportation to the cell surface, but this does not exclude the action of YLMY on other factors to regulate F protein expression in areas of lipid raft distribution. Increasing evidence has demonstrated that the glycoprotein is needed to either recruit M to assembly or initiate budding. This process is well characterized for the SeV fusion protein, which depends on the TYTLE motif in the CT of the protein (23, 43) . The host cytoskeleton has been shown to play an important role in budding with several paramyxoviruses, and mutations of some domains in F result in a significant reduction in SeV viral particles production, which is reminiscent of certain motifs of F proteins that bind to specific host proteins to participate in budding (44) . The increased F-protein colocalization with lipid rafts may be another reasonable explanation for the hypofusogenic phenotype of the rSG10*-FY527A and rSG10*-FYY524 1 527AA mutants, as F proteins are concentrated where lipid rafts gather to participate in subsequent assembly and budding, leaving less F protein available to participate in cell fusion. The distribution of F protein expression at lipid rafts and other regions will need to be confirmed to prove our assumption.",

Deciphering the F protein intracellular trafficking mechanism and the signal that controls this will undoubtedly be important to our understanding of NDV pathogenesis, and the identification of sequences essential for viral transportation and release may form the basis for novel antiviral therapeutics. The roles of the F protein YLMY motif and the potential host binding factors in the transportation of F protein are of great interest. The highly conserved nature of the motif, coupled with its sensitivity to mutation, suggests that the YLMY motif located within CT of the F protein may conduct YxxU functions in order to subvert host protein sorting machinery, such as AP1 and AP2, and further facilitate NDV release, making it a subject of interest for further research. It will be interesting to identify potential antiviral targets common to both enveloped RNA and DNA viruses with the intention of preventing systemic infection.",
