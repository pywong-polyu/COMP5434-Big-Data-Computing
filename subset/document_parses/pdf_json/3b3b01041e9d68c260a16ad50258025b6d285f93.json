What role can clinicians and healthcare institutions play in supporting patients' pursuits of both a healthy and a flourishing life? What obligations do healthcare providers, clinics and hospitals, healthfocused non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and global health organisations hold towards unauthorised migrants, asylum seekers, refugees and other vulnerable migrant groups? Drawing on our experience as a group of social scientists and clinicians who have worked with precarious migrants in and from Asia, Africa, Europe, North America and the Middle East, we know that even under the best of circumstances, many migrants have difficulty being seen, heard and recognised by healthcare providers as full human beings whose lives involve more than just their migration status. [1] [2] [3] [4] As the COVID-19 pandemic has only made clearer, 5 migrants' health often is treated as less deserving of attention and investment than other groups', [6] [7] [8] and migrants with precarious status often are shunted away systematically from mainstream systems of care and coverage. 9 When care is accessible, barriers of language, education, socioeconomic status, racialised identity, culture and religion can impede patient-provider Summary box \u25ba Health is deeply interconnected with humans' ability to flourish-to lead a 'good life', shape their future and achieve their potential. \u25ba Migrants' health and flourishing are often impeded by structural exclusions as well as negative portrayals that cast them as undeserving of collective attention, investment or care. \u25ba Healthcare providers, institutions and clinical training programmes have vital roles to play in promoting migrants' health and their capacity to flourish, both individually and collectively. \u25ba Flourishing means different things to different people and in different communities and cultural settings. \u25ba Healthcare professionals must recognise that flourishing is an active pursuit influenced by cultural expectations, social relationships, and the social, political and economic structures that shape people's lives. \u25ba Supporting the health and flourishing of vulnerable migrants and other excluded groups requires new tools, more expansive approaches to care provision and collaborative models that reach beyond the health domain.",

Lack of insurance can obstruct access to comprehensive treatment and follow-up care. 10 In some settings, NGOs or charity-based clinics are migrants' best, or only, options. 11 In public, private and NGO settings alike, clinicians often have limited awareness of migrants' social, political and economic circumstances, and misunderstanding and bias, overt or implicit, can impede clinical rapport. 12 All of these obstacles can harm migrants' health and diminish their capacity to flourish. What can clinicians do to promote human flourishing when so many of these factors lie outside the clinical domain? Certainly, clinicians and health institutions cannot be expected to resolve the profound inequities that harm health and impede patients' capacity to achieve their full potential. They can, however, broaden their gaze and re-envision their roles and responsibilities in light of the multiple barriers that often deny migrants and other vulnerable and minoritised patients the resources needed to live-and the chance to be recognised as worthy of living-full and meaningful lives.",

Mr S: When health is not enough One summer evening, Mr S appeared at a non-governmental organisation (NGO)-run clinic in Tel Aviv requesting the impossible. 28 He and his fianc\u00e9e, Ms R, both undocumented migrants from Ghana, were determined to marry in a Catholic ceremony. But before a wedding date could be set, the local parish required several documents, including a doctor's letter attesting that neither had HIV. Yet, both Mr S and Ms R had recently been diagnosed with HIV and were receiving antiretroviral (ARV) treatment via another local NGO. On that clinic visit, Mr S laid bare his dilemma. He was desperate to marry his bride. But he was just as desperate to keep their secret. If people found out they had HIV, he explained, 'we would be cut off from the community. I would die first'-he noted, at his own hand, if need be.",

At the meeting, the priest received assurances from Mr S and Ms R that each was fully informed of the other's health status and that they shared a hope to have healthy children, which would be medically possible with appropriate ARV treatment and NGO support. Satisfied by their discreet conversation, the priest authorised their wedding and agreed to keep their health status in confidence.

As a result, they will be better equipped to confront obstacles to flourishing and health that stem from language and sociocultural differences, bureaucracy, discrimination and poverty. \u25ba Healthcare providers must learn to recognise that flourishing means different things to different people in different communities-and ask questions that can help them understand and work to meet their patients' needs. This means taking time to understand why migrant patients' needs or concerns may diverge from routine clinical care, and to consider with an open mind why patients may be unable or unwilling to meet clinicians' expectations or follow recommendations. \u25ba On a related note, health providers and institutions must develop the skills and infrastructure needed for effective partnership and collaboration between care providers and non-medical organisations and institutions-including stakeholders in law, public health and human rights. 38 Clinical interventions alone will not promote flourishing-or health-among migrant patients. But clinicians can develop new modes of 'prescribing'for instance, by using integrative healing strategies in the same way some primary care clinicians prescribe food, and some paediatricians prescribe books or reading. [39] [40] [41] They can partner with rights organisations to document abuses that harm migrants' health, violate their rights and diminish their capacity to realise their full potential. Legal-medical partnerships can help confront upstream obstacles to flourishing and health by calling attention to root causes and political determinants. 42 Finally, integrative care models that work across medical, legal, social, cultural and/or religious sectors (eg, women-friendly spaces, self-care interventions based on a logic of 'expert-patients', 43 approaches to 'syndemic care' 44 ) can serve as useful models. \u25ba Health professionals and healthcare organisations can work to transform social, economic and structural circumstances that impede flourishing and harm health-for migrants and for other vulnerable patients and communities. Clinicians can use their social position to engage in collective organising to support vulnerable migrant groups and others who have been ignored or harmed by the determining impact of social, political and economic circumstances. Both within their institutions and in broader public and policy conversations, care providers and healthcare institutions can insist on naming, documenting and tackling health inequities that simultaneously harm their patients' health and curtail their capacity to shape their futures and realise their full potential.
