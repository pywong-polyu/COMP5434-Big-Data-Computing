Ultimately, we are interested in the prospect of developing a self-administered (inhalable) immunoprophylactic capable of conferring immediate immunity to RT, which could be used in the field by military or civilian first responders. As noted in the introduction, Respaud and colleagues have already conducted proof-of-principle studies and successfully delivered an RT-specific neutralizing MAb to mice with the goal of preventing/treating pulmonary intoxication [19] . There are obvious technical challenges associated with this route of delivery, including distinct differences in IgG half-lives within the context of the lung, which have been noted even when the MAbs that have the same Fc domains [27] [28] [29] [30] . The apparent differences in half lives were attributed to non-specific tissue binding or poor stability dictated in part by the Fv elements. Nonetheless, the fundamental biology and technology associated with aerosol delivery of MAbs could be applied in theory to combatting other toxins or infectious agents that cause severe acute respiratory disease, including the new coronavirus (SARS CoV-2).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 382, "end": 386, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 387, "end": 390, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 857, "end": 861, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1095, "end": 1099, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1100, "end": 1104, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1105, "end": 1109, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1114, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The mechanism(s) by which PB10 and SylH3 work to neutralize RT is an area of active investigation. PB10 is directed against an immunodominant epitope on RT's enzymatic subunit (RTA), while SylH3 is against an epitope localized to RTB's domain 1 (Vance, D.; Poon, A. and Mantis, N. manuscript in preparation). SylH3 s in vitro profile is similar to many other anti-RTB MAbs that have been described in the literature, although it stands out because it is the most effective MAb in our collection at blocking RT-receptor interactions in vitro [31] . We hypothesize that the PB10/SylH3 cocktail has dual activities: it blocks RT attachment to host cells and it interferes with retrograde transport of ricin from the plasma membrane to the TGN [31, 32] . We hypothesize that the presence of huPB10 and huSyH3 in the lung at the time of ricin challenge results in antibody-mediated entrapment of the toxin within the alveolar space. This hypothesis is based on a recent study in mice with the anti-Ebola antibody cocktail ZMapp, which indicated that the antibodies did indeed limit accessibility and mobility of the virus in the airways [33] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 541, "end": 545, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 740, "end": 744, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 745, "end": 748, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1132, "end": 1136, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There are a large number of RT-specific MAbs from mice and NHPs described in the literature that have been shown to be able to passively protect mice against RT challenge [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . It is unclear whether the PB10/SylH3 cocktail is any more potent that other possible combinations of MAbs described, since systematic comparisons have not been conducted, although certainly the two MAbs are the best within our collection [10] .
