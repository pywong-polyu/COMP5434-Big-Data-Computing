            "text": "Background Surgical smoke during operation is a well-known health hazard for medical staff. This study aimed to investigate the dynamics of surgical smoke during open surgery or laparoscopic surgery for colorectal disease. Methods This study quantitated particulate matter (PM) counts as part of surgical smoke in 31 consecutive patients who underwent colectomy at the Niigata City General Hospital using a laser particle counter. Particles were graded by size as \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm PM (PM 2.5 ) or > 2.5 \u03bcm PM (large PM). Operative procedures were categorized as either open surgery (n = 14) or laparoscopic surgery (n = 17). Results The median patient age was 72 (range 41-89) years and 58.1% were male. The total PM 2.5 , PM 2.5 per hour, and maximum PM 2.5 per minute counts during operation were significantly higher in open surgery than in laparoscopic surgery (P = 0.001, P < 0.001, and P = 0.029, respectively). Large PM counts (total, per hour, and maximum per minute) were also higher in the open surgery group than in the laparoscopic surgery group. The maximum PM 2.5 concentration recorded was 38.6 \u00b5m/m 3 , which is considered \"unhealthy for sensitive groups\" according to the U.S. Environment Protection Agency air quality index standards, if it was a 24-h period mean value. Conclusion Exposure to surgical smoke is lower during laparoscopic surgery than during open surgery for colorectal diseases.",

Several reports have documented human papillomavirus (HPV) transmission to gynecologists or operating room nurse after laser ablation [5] [6] [7] , and the presence of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and human immunodeficiency virus have been confirmed in surgical smoke [8, 9] . Regrettably, most medical staff are not aware of the risks because of the low frequency of transmission; however, we think that this risk of infection should be noted, especially in preventing infection in the coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) era.",

Open surgery or laparoscopic surgery for gastroenterological diseases usually requires several hours and involves the frequent use of various devices, such as electric and ultrasonic scalpels, and sealing devices.

Laparoscopic procedures were multiport, with approximately four or five ports, and used the Olympus endoscopic system (VISERA ELITE II\u2122). In this system, the surgical smoke was automatically evacuated using ultrasonic scalpel, but was not linked using electric scalpel. We did not use the complex integrated smoke evaluation system with ultra-low particulate air (ULPA) filters in this study. Specimens were removed through a small laparotomy incision.",

Here, particle size > 2.5 \u00b5m was defined as \"large PM,\" and data were recorded as 1-min average counts. The particles with a size \u2264 2.5 \u03bcm are defined as \"PM 2.5 .\" In this monitor, the counts of small particle (> 0.5 \u03bcm) display the counts including large particles (> 2.5 \u03bcm). Therefore, PM 2.5 counts were calculated by subtracting large particle counts from small particle counts. The PM 2.5 concentration (\u00b5m/m 3 ) was estimated as described previously [17] . The concentration of PM 2.5 resulting in adverse health outcomes was determined based on the U.S. Environment Protection Agency (USEPA) air quality index (AQI) specifications ( Fig. 1 ) [18] . The dust monitor was placed on the patient's head side and at the same height as the surgeon's face during the operation.",
