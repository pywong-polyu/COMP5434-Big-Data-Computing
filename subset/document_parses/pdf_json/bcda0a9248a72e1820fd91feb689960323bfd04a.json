            "text": "Relationship of COVID-19 and immunity is complex and can involve autoimmune reactions through molecular mimicry. We investigated autoimmunity related pathological mechanisms involving molecular mimicry that are common to certain coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by means of a selected peptide sequence (CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC). Accordingly, coronavirusassociated sequences that are homologous to that 15mer sequence in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome are attained first. Then, homologous human and coronavirus sequences are obtained, wherein the coronavirus sequences are homologous to the 15mer SARS-CoV-2 peptide. All the identified query-subject sequences contained at least 7 residue matches in the aligned regions. Finally, parts of those coronavirus and host sequences, which are predicted to have high affinity to the same human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles as that of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence, are selected among the query and subject epitope-pairs that were both (predicted to be) strongly binding to the same HLA alleles. The proteins or the protein regions with those predicted epitopes include, but not limited to, immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions, phospholipid phosphatase-related protein type 2, slit homolog 2 protein, and CRB1 isoform I precursor. These proteins are potentially associated with certain pathologies, but especially the possible CRB1 related coronavirus pathogenicity could be furthered by autoimmunity risk in HLA*A24:02 serotypes. Overall, results imply autoimmunity risk in COVID-19 patients with HLA*A02:01 and HLA*A24:02 serotypes in general, through molecular mimicry. This is also common to other coronaviruses than SARS-CoV-2. These results are indicative at the current stage, they need to be validated. Yet, they can pave the way to autoimmunity treatment options to be used in COVID-19 and its associated diseases.",

            "text": "Upon infection, presence of similar sequences to the pathogens' proteins in the human proteome can be a potential risk of causing autoimmune response. This molecular mimicry is among the preliminary conditions. Kerkar and Vergani [1] mentioned molecular mimicry, sequence similarities of pathogenic organisms with autoantigens, as a possible mechanism of autoimmunity, and is conceptually reinforced through the discoveries of de novo autoimmune hepatitis associated with certain viral infections. In 90s, a sequence similarity search revealed 70 % overlap of a 10mer within the V3-loop of the envelope glycoprotein gp120 of HIV-1 isolates, with the collagen-like region of the human complement component C1q-A [2] . Follow-up studies by the same group addressed the complications that would be caused by vaccines, which are based on gp120 of HIV-1 [3] . Later, their findings on the presence of antibodies that are reactive for the peptide in the V3-loop of HIV-1 in the healthy individuals [4] , and the complementarity of the antibodies for V3-loop of HIV-1 and IgG of human [5] were reported. Presence of homologies between human proteins and virus proteins, and the examination of the pathways of those homologous peptides, drew attention to the pathologies of viral infections that are related to the immune response [6] . Even therapies targeting such complexifications were suggested. In correlation with these, Kanduc and Shoenfeld [7] considered the intrinsic hazards in the vaccines that are based on such pathogen sequences. These authors [8] later added onto their earlier findings by looking for pentapeptide sharing between the viral, bacterial, protozoan pathogens, and human. There, it was suggested that the respective results could elucidate the decadesold \"original antigenic sin\" phenomenon. Further, \"negative selection of self-reactive lymphocytes\" was concluded to be unlikely, in a later study of the researchers [9] . Similarities among the SARS-CoV-spike glycoprotein sequences and those of the human surfactant protein and the related proteins were revealed by similar methodology [10] . Specifically, 13 of 24 shared pentapeptides were found to be present in 52 SARS-CoV-derived immunoreactive epitopes. In addition, heptapeptide-sharing among pathogens, which are also containing SARS-CoV-2, and the non-human primates, was observed and it revealed that high level of peptide-sharing is somewhat unique to human [11] . Among the other animals that are used for preclinical tests, mice would more expectedly reveal autoimmune reactions. Eventually, \"aged mice\" was suggested to be appropriate for testing of vaccines, which are based on spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 [12] .",

It is suggested to be a risk factor upon being exposed to Enterobacteriaceae, for patients with rheumatoid arthritis, who are expressing HLA DRB1*04:01. There are other examples, e.g.: In systemic lupus erythematosus, a 7mer peptide region of Epstein-Barr virus nuclear antigen 1 has cross-reactivity with an 8mer region of Sm [14] . In systemic sclerosis, a 12mer peptide has homology with the human cytomegalovirus late protein UL94, and it reacts with the IgG of patients [15] . In primary biliary cholangitis, E2 component of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complexes of human and E. coli have similar regions at a peptide of the human protein that is 31 amino acids (aa) in length [16] .",

            "text": "Relationship of COVID-19 and immunity is complex [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] and it can involve autoimmune reactions through molecular mimicry. Woodruff et al. [23] recently reported that critically ill patients of COVID-19 \"displayed hallmarks of extrafollicular B cell activation as previously described in autoimmune settings.\" Rodr\u00edguez and coworkers [24] recently reviewed autoinflammatory and autoimmune conditions in COVID-19. Accordingly, antiphospholipid syndrome, autoimmune cytopenia, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and Kawasaki disease are known to be reported in COVID-19 patients [24] . Regarding molecular mimicry, Cappello and co-workers [25] hypothesized that SARS-CoV-2 may be generating autoimmunity through molecular mimicry, induced by stress. Rodr\u00edguez and co-workers [24] mentioned the molecular mimicry and bystander activation as the mechanisms that can link COVID-19 to autoimmunity. In relation, Lucchese and Fl\u00f6el [26] reported three 6mers in the human brainstem respiratory pacemaker proteins that are present in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. These authors also reported molecular mimicry with SARS-CoV-2 and heat shock proteins 90 and 60 of human, which are known to be associated with Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome and other autoimmune diseases [27] . Importantly, the shared peptides are part of those epitopes that were experimentally shown to be immunoreactive. Also, one of the works that is mentioned above [10] reported 5mers of human surfactant protein to be present in the SARS-CoV-2 proteome. Angileri and co-workers [28] reported a 7mer of human Odorant Receptor 7D4, a 6mer of human Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase Family Member 9, and a 7mer of Solute Carrier Family 12 Member 6, which are present in the putative epitopes of SARS-CoV-2. There are also human proteins that have strong immune cross-reactions with the spike protein antibody of SARS-CoV-2 [29] , which can be suggestive of autoimmunity by means of molecular mimicry in susceptible individuals [24] . In relation, aim of the current study is to look for autoimmunity related pathological mechanisms that are common to certain coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV-2, by means of a selected sequence (CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC), which is obtained through our ongoing study [30] involving tblastx search of SARS-CoV-2 and plasmodium species that cause malaria in human [31, 32] .",

It was the aligned query sequence in the tblastx output that revealed the top identity between the query and subject, which was afterwards utilized as input for NCBI blastp search, by limiting the search to SARS-CoV-2 (taxid:2697049), to ensure that the sequence is expressed [30] . Here, in this study, blast of the sequence is performed at Uniprot with threshold 10 (performed on 5 August 2020). The associated coronaviruses with homologous sequences are selected from the results. Then, blastp of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence and the coronavirus sequences that are homologous, are performed separately, by limiting the searches to H. sapiens (taxid:9606). The query-subject sequence pairs that have at least 7 residue matches are found in those results. Within those results, the ones with the same names and sequence IDs as those in the respective results of SARS-CoV-2 blastp search, are identified. This is followed by major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I binding predictions for those identified query-subject sequence pairs. This is done to find the coronavirus and human sequences that are homologous, and which are predicted to bind strongly to the same HLA alleles as that with the SARS-CoV-2 sequence. To do that, binding affinities to the MHC class I (MHC class I genes are human leukocyte antigen A [HLA-A], -B, and -C genes [35] ) proteins are predicted with the use of a tool that integrates NetMHC 4.0 [36, 37] , NetMHCpan 4.1 [38] , and PickPocket 1.1 [39] . That tool is NetMHCcons 1.1 [40] . Predictions are performed for 8-15mers, with default parameters, and by performing the predictions for 12 MHC supertype representatives. [41] is utilized as well, similarly, for the prediction of the epitopes of cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL), as 8-11mers. Within the prediction results, epitopes with at least 5 residue matches and strong binding affinities to the same MHC supertype representative are considered for possible risk of autoimmunity-related pathological mechanisms that are common to SARS-CoV-2 and associated coronaviruses, based on similarity to the selected short SARS-CoV-2 sequence. Epitope-pairs with the highest number of residue-matches are displayed.",

These epitope-pairs are shown in consecutive rows and each epitope-pair have at least 5 matching-residues. Residues in these epitope-pairs are written bold if they are among the matching-residues in the original alignments. Those residues are further underlined if they are still present as matching-residues in the predicted epitope-pairs. HLA allele is indicated in the first column. Accordingly, the same HLA allele is displayed in case of the coronavirus (query) and human (subject) epitope-pairs. Epitopes predicted by NetMHCcons are displayed here. Epitope-pairs that are sourced by the alignments of the SARS-CoV-2 15mer (query seq-1) are shown in the third column. In the second column, 1 indicates the SARS-CoV-2 (query) sequence-number and it is written at the rows, which correspond to the same rows as the SARS-CoV-2 (query) epitopes of the epitope-pairs at the third column. Epitope-pairs that are sourced by the alignments of the other coronavirus sequences are shown in the fifth column. The numbers in the fourth column indicates the other coronaviruses' (queries') sequencenumbers and they are written at the rows, which correspond to the same rows as the respective coronaviruses' (queries') epitopes of the epitope-pairs at the fifth column. Names of the human proteins with the aligned subject sequences are displayed at the last column. ",

The latter query and subject epitope-pairs are shaded in grey, together with the number(s) designating the respective query sequences in the front. Table 3 that the predicted epitope-pairs, which include peptides that are sourced by two immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions (sequence IDs MOQ87140.1 and MOP50498.1) and phospholipid phosphatase-related protein type 2 isoform (sequence ID XP_024307423.1), bind strongly to the HLA*A02:01 (A2) allele. On the other hand, those that include peptides that are sourced by hCG1995581 (sequence ID EAW57092.1), two other immunoglobulin heavy chain junction regions (sequence IDs MON95290.1 and MCG41834.1), hCG2028737 (sequence ID EAW73174.1), CRB1 isoform I precursor (sequence ID AAL10681.1) and slit homolog 2 protein isoform (sequence ID XP_011512212.2), bind strongly to the HLA*A24:02 (A24) allele. Peptides of most of these proteins that overlap with the SARS-CoV-2 peptide's sequence (seq-1) overlap with the CFLGYCCCCYFGLFC sequence (seq-2) as well. This is expected since CFLGYCCCCYFGLFC (seq-2) is closer to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide (seq-1), compared to the other sequences ( Figure 1 ). Yet, the CRB1 isoform I precursor is the protein that is containing an antigenic, similar peptide to the highest number of different coronavirus sequences (query seq-3 to -6) that are homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 15mer (query seq-1) ( Table 3 ). This makes the epitope, which is part of the CRB1 isoform I precursor, a strong candidate of a common mechanism of autoimmune reaction risk in the individuals with the HLA*A24:02 serotype, sourced by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses. CRB1 related coronavirus pathogenicity is already suggested [45, 46] . Here, it is suggested that possible CRB1 related coronavirus pathogenicity is additionally furthered by autoimmunity risk in certain individuals.

            "text": "Bianchi and co-workers [47] indicated in their paper that studies involving peptide elution confirmed the presentation of transmembrane helices by the MHC class I molecules. In accordance, CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC is also likely a transmembrane region, and is predicted as a strong binder to certain HLA alleles, in the same manner as its homologous sequences in the human proteome [48] . In this study, its subset that is common to other coronaviruses, which have a peptide sequence that is homologous to CFLGYFCTCYFGLFC, is found (Table 3) . Some associated diseases of the proteins with the aligned peptides as potential epitopes are already mentioned in the \"summary information.\" In relation to this study, Lyons-Weiler [49] identified immunogenic epitopes that are present in the proteome of SARS-CoV-2. They then compared those epitopes with the proteome of human. More than 1/3 of peptides that are immunogenic were found to be homologous to the proteins that are significant in the adaptive immune system. Kanduc [50] suggested that there is an extensive range of health disorders, related to probable autoimmunity reactions against peptides of the human proteome, which have homology with the immunogenic peptides of SARS-CoV-2. Also, it was indicated in another study [51] that cerebrospinal fluids from the patients of COVID-19 were suggestive of autoimmunity. In line with those studies, the results presented here suggest autoimmunity risk in COVID-19 patients with HLA*A02:01 and HLA*A24:02 serotypes, by means of molecular mimicry, as a common risk to their exposure to the other coronaviruses. This is because immune responses to the peptides and proteins with similar sequences and strong binding affinities to the same HLA allele can lead to autoimmune responses [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . Yet, Trost and co-workers [55] pointed at dramatically high number of common heptapeptides (7mers) between bacterial and human proteomes. In relation, Amela and co-workers [59] demonstrated that most of the pathogen proteins that can cause antibody generation by the host immune system are not homologous to the human proteins and vice versa. Distinguishing self from non-self was suggested to be one contributing mechanism [60] . In addition, there need to be genetic, physiological, and environmental [13] variations in action. Besides, studies are generally performed or initiated by analysing the reference genomes, but individual genetic variations in the identified sequences could well influence the outcomes in real, including those for the vaccines [61] . For evaluation, it is offered that the detection of cross-reacting T-cells or antibodies, epidemiological connection between exposures to or possessing the risk factors and following development of autoimmune disease, and duplicability of the conditions in animal model(s), are the needed proofs, in addition to the presence of similarity. Autoimmune reactions were shown to be developed in the animal models under such conditions (e.g. [62, 63] ). Yet, the last two criteria of those are challenging, and besides, not free from concerns [13] .",

Interestingly, Warren and Birol [66] identified the same allele in predictions from the transcriptome sequences of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of 4 15 among 5 COVID-19 patients from China. Differently, this allele was reported by the authors as not (recognised as) a SARS-risk-factor. On the other hand, only the query-subject sequence pairs that are predicted to bind strongly to the same HLA alleles with each other and with that of the SARS-CoV-2 sequence are considered here and prediction results with weak binding affinities are eliminated. This may have diminished the number of results here. Also, current study involves one SARS-CoV-2 peptide and performing a similar study with the whole proteome of the virus will be providing a much comprehensive view.",

For that, coronavirus sequences homologous to the SARS-CoV-2 peptide are initially obtained. Afterwards, we identified those homologous coronavirus sequences that are aligning with the human proteins with at least 7 residue matches, which are common to the alignments of the SARS-CoV-2 15mer with the human protein sequences, in a similar fashion. So, coronavirus (query) and human (subject) epitope-pairs are identified. Those epitope-pairs are the ones that are predicted to bind strongly to the same HLA alleles, not only with each other but also with that of the SARS-CoV-2 15mer and its aligned sequence in the same human protein.",

They can be related to pathological conditions. Particularly the probable coronavirus pathogenicity related to CRB1 is suggested to be promoted by autoimmunity risk in the individuals with the HLA*A24:02 serotypes. Overall, the results infer autoimmunity risk in COVID-19 individuals with HLA*A02:01 and HLA*A24:02 serotypes, in general, by means of molecular mimicry. Further, it is common to other coronaviruses. This is based on their homology to the SARS-CoV-2 15mer, and their aligning with the same human proteins as those that are aligning with the SARS-CoV-2 15mer, and their binding affinity predictions, which are revealed to be strong for the same HLA alleles. These findings can pave the way to clinical studies for autoimmunity treatment options to be used in COVID-19 and associated diseases.",
