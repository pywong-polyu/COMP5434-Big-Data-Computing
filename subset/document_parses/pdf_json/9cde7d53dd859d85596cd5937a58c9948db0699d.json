Football leagues were suddenly stopped and each country was hesitating between a relaunch of the competition and a premature ending. Some opted for the latter option, and took as the final standing of the season the ranking from the moment the competition got interrupted. This decision has been perceived as unfair, especially by those teams who had remaining matches against easier opponents. In this paper, we introduce a tool to calculate in a fairer way the final standings of domestic leagues that have to stop prematurely: our Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator (PFSC). It is based on a stochastic model taking into account the results of the matches played and simulating the remaining matches, yielding the probabilities for the various possible final rankings. We have compared our PFSC with state-of-the-art prediction models, using previous seasons which we pretend to stop at different points in time. We illustrate our PFSC by showing how a probabilistic ranking of the French Ligue 1 in the stopped 2019-2020 season could have led to alternative, potentially fairer, decisions on the final standing.",

Indeed, the absence of regular income through ticket selling, television money and merchandising around live matches entailed that a large majority of professional clubs no longer were able to pay their players and other employees (Sky Sports, 2020; kicker, 2020) . Professional football having become such a big business, this also had an impact on other people whose main income was related to football matches (BBC Sport, 2020).

Should it simply be declared void, should the current ranking be taken as final ranking, or should only a part of the season be evaluated? Either decision would have an enormous financial impact given the huge amount of money at stake. Which team would be declared champion? Which teams would be allowed to represent their country at the European level and hence earn a lot of money through these international games, especially in the Champions League? Which teams would be relegated and, as a potential consequence, be forced to dismiss several employees? Moreover, the broadcasting revenue is allocated on the basis of final standings. Different countries reacted differently: the Eredivisie had no champion nor relegated teams, but the teams qualified for the European competitions were decided based on the ranking of March 8. The Ligue 1 and the Jupiler Pro League, on the other hand, declared also a champion and relegated teams on the basis of the ranking from the moment their seasons got stopped. However, the Jupiler Pro League had to come back on this decision and the relegation was nullified. The Ligue 1 based their final standing on the ratio of points earned per game, since not all teams had played an equal amount of games when the season got stopped. Obviously, several teams were not pleased by such decisions, considering them to be unfair (Holroyd, 2020) because, inevitably, this favoured those teams that had still to play the strongest opponents in the remaining matches over those that were looking forward to a rather light end-of-season.",

It also represents a bigger challenge than evaluating in a fair way an abruptly stopped single game, where for instance cricket has adopted a mathematical formula known as the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern method (Duckworth and Lewis, 1998) . The literature addressing the challenging question of how a stopped season should be evaluated in the most objective way is fuelled by proposals from after the outbreak of COVID-19. The first and third authors of this paper used the current-strength based rankings by Ley et al. (2019) , a statistical model based on the bivariate Poisson distribution and weighted maximum likelihood, to provide all possible final standings of the Belgian Jupiler Pro League together with their associated probabilities. Their results were summarized in a mainstream journal (Het Laatste Nieuws, 2020). Guyon (2020) proposed an Elo-based approach applied to the English Premier League. Lambers and Spieksma (2020) suggested an eigenvector-based approach, while Csat\u00f3 (2020) discussed general criteria that a fair ranking should fulfil in such a situation and proposed the generalized row sum method. Recently, Gorgi et al. (2020) used a statistical model to determine a ranking based on the expected total number of points per team.",

            "text": "In this paper, we investigate the extent to which a relatively simple stochastic model can serve the purpose of producing fair final standings for prematurely stopped round-robin type football competitions. Our original approach goes as follows. We construct a stochastic soccer model that is fitted on the played matches and then is used to simulate the remainder of the competition a large number of times, thus yielding for every team the probabilities to reach each possible final rank. This output is much richer in terms of information than giving only the most likely or the expected ranking. This also explains the terminology for our model, namely Probabilistic Final Standing Calculator, which we abbreviate as PFSC. In order to assess its predictive strength, we compare our PFSC with two benchmark prediction models, namely the best performing model of Ley et al. (2019) , that uses a similar stochastic model to estimate the current strength of a team based on its matches played in the last two years, and the plus-minus-ratings approach of Pantuso and Hvattum (2020) that is based on the strengths of the players making up the teams. For each model, the probabilistic final standing of a not yet ended season is obtained by simulating the remaining matches 100,000 times, which gives us for every team the probabilities of reaching each possible place in the final standing. It is not appropriate to compare the predictions of these models on the 2019-2020 competitions which were resumed after the break, since those matches were played under different circumstances, including the absence of fans. It has been shown (Fischer and Haucap, 2020 ) that these changed conditions could influence team performances, by lowering the effect of the home advantage. Therefore we rather compare the three models on the basis of the three preceding seasons of the five most important European football leagues (England, Spain, Germany, Italy and France), which we stopped artificially after every match day. Our evaluation of the models' performance is done in two ways: by means of the Rank Probability Score (RPS) (Epstein, 1969) and the Tournament Rank Probability Score (TRPS) (Ekstr\u00f8m et al., 2020) , see Section 2.4 for their definition. From this comparison, we can see at which point in time the PFSC is able to catch up with the two high-performing but more complicated prediction models. The reader may now wonder why we do not use any of these more elaborate models as PFSC; the reason is that we wish to propose a handy tool that sports professionals can indeed use without the need of too long computation time or large data collections. In the same vein, we will also make the PFSC freely available on the software R (R Core Team, 2020).",

The parameters \u03bb C , \u03b2 0 , h and the strength parameters r 1 , ..., r n are estimated using the matches played so far in the current season. Next, these parameters are used to simulate 100,000 times the remaining matches, by sampling the number of goals for each team in each match from the corresponding bivariate Poisson distribution. For each simulated end of season, a final standing is created based on the played and simulated matches, taking into account the specific rules of the leagues. The probabilistic final standing is then calculated by averaging the results over all 100,000 simulations, giving each team a probability to reach every possible rank. Note that Gorgi et al. (2020) also used the bivariate Poisson distribution as their statistical model, but they only calculate expected ranks and not the complete probabilistic picture as we do.",

From the findings of the previous section, we know that after this number of match days, our PFSC is a competitive model for predicting the remaining matches and the final ranking. Based on the played matches, the teams strengths were estimated, which resulted in the strengths reported in Table 2 . We can see that Paris Saint-Germain (PSG) is by far considered as the strongest team in the league. Surprisingly, Olympique Lyon comes out as the second strongest team, while only standing on the 7th place in the official ranking at that time. This could indicate that Lyon did have some bad luck during the season. Looking at their match results, we could see that in almost all their lost matches, they lost with a goal difference of 1 goal. Only PSG at home managed to get a margin of two goals against Lyon. At the bottom of the table, we find that Toulouse was the weakest team in the league, followed by Amiens, St. Etienne and N\u00eemes. This is in agreement with the official ranking, up to a slightly different ordering of the teams. Using these strengths, we have simulated the remainder of the season 100,000 times and by taking the mean over these simulations, we have calculated the probabilities for each team to reach each possible position, which is summarized in Table 3 . We can see that PSG would win the league with approximately 100% probability, thanks to the big lead they had and the high team strength. Marseille had a 77% chance of keeping the second position, with also a certain chance of becoming third (18%), or even fourth (5%).

For our example, there is little doubt. PSG was expected to be the winner of the league with an estimated chance of 100%, so they should be considered as the champions of the Ligue 1.

To compensate for this, they should hand over P 2 \u2212(0.77 * P 2 +0.18 * P 3 +0.05 * P 4 ) = 0.18 * (P 2 \u2212P 3 )+0.05 * (P 2 \u2212P 4 ) to the compensation fund.

There will still be the difficulty of estimating the expected profit from reaching a certain rank (e.g., a team reaching the Europe League will have further merchandising advantages besides the profit mentioned above as compared to the team classified just outside of these ranks), but we believe that this tool could be very useful for decision-makers in determining which teams have received an advantage or disadvantage from an early stop of the league, and how to compensate for this.

We have shown the strength of our PFSC by comparing it to two benchmark models that are based on much more information, and yet our PFSC is exhibiting similar performances except when a season would get stopped extremely early, which however was anyway more a theoretical than a practical concern (a season stopped after less than a third of the games played would certainly be declared void).
