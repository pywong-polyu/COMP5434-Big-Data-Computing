Varied forms of data were collected, including (1) semi-structured interviews with students, (2) mid-term and final course evaluations, (3) two rounds of online debates, (4) four weeks of online reflection journals, and (5) the instructor's reflections. Thematical analysis and descriptive statistics were conducted to analyze qualitative and quantitative data respectively. Multiple methods were employed to establish trustworthiness of the study. Effective and ineffective instructional strategies and technology uses were identified in BL. The findings indicated that students valued real-time interactions with peers and the instructor. However, inappropriate asynchronous discussions were considered less effective in BL. In addition, immediate feedback from peers and the instructor motivated learners and improved the quality of their work. Learning technologies played a critical role in BL, but the use of learning technologies should be simplified and streamlined. Technical support was essential to reduce learners' cognitive load.",

As a paradigm shift from teaching to learning (Nunan et al., 2000) , researchers predicted that BL has the potential to be widely adopted in higher education (Norberg et al., 2011) and to transform F2F 1 3 learning (Donnelly, 2010) .

Researchers have also found that effective blended course design and instruction could make students feel connected with others (e.g., Cocquyt et al., 2017) . In addition to the benefits of BL, some research focused on the affordance of the emerging technologies for collaborative learning (Gan et al., 2015) . However, studies also show that technologies could hinder teaching and learning if not used properly (Bower et al., 2015; Park & Bonk, 2007) .

Research indicates that BL increases learning effectiveness, efficiency, satisfaction (Garrison & Kanuka, 2004; Graham, 2013; Mart\u00ednez-Caro & Campuzano-Bolarin, 2011) , performance (Boyle et al., 2003; Lim & Morris, 2009) , engagement (Owston et al., 2013) , attendance (Stockwell et al., 2015) , and fosters collaboration (So & Brush, 2008) . For instance, research conducted at the University of Central Florida has found that the success rates for BL were higher than either fully traditional face-to-face or completely online courses (Graham, 2013) . Some studies also suggest that BL improved students' knowledge construction and problem-solving skills (Bridges et al., 2015) . Second, BL has great potentials to increase access and flexibility (Graham, 2006; Moskal et al., 2013) . With flexibility in time and location for learning (King & Arnold, 2012) , BL potentially increases access to education (Shea, 2007) . Last, BL may improve the cost-effectiveness of education (Graham, 2013) , as it reduces operational costs compared to traditional on-campus learning (Vaughan, 2007; Woltering et al., 2009 ).",

Learnerlearner interactions may stimulate two-way collaborative learning (Kuo & Belland, 2016; Moore, 1989) , and they are particularly important in online courses (Anderson, 2008) . Learner-instructor interactions streamline communications between learner and instructor and also facilitates the delivery of instructions, guidance, and support to learners (Kuo & Belland, 2016; Moore, 1989) . Learner-content interaction is typically one-way communication, in which learners interact with the content (Kuo & Belland, 2016; Moore, 1989) , although emerging technologies have made it possible to dynamically generate highly customized content or learning experiences. Students can interact with peers, instructors, and learning content in BL (Moore, 1989) , especially through interactive technologies (Anderson, 2008) and appropriate pedagogies.",

While learners demanding emotional or cognitive support would require timely and considerate facilitations from the instructor in BL (Butz et al., 2014; Szeto & Cheng, 2016) . Discussions in BL could happen in either F2F or online sessions or continue in both settings. In F2F discussions, learners could share ideas and receive an immediate response; whereas, online discussions added advantages that could not be achieved in F2F settings (Joubert & Wishart, 2012; Richardson & Ice, 2010) . For example, in online asynchronous discussions, students have more time to read, digest, and reflect upon learning materials, which promotes critical thinking (Putman et al., 2012; Williams & Lahman, 2011) . However, online discussions, if without sufficient support or stimulus, can be superficial or wordy yet without depth (Angeli et al., 2003; Wallace, 2003) . Therefore, researchers have proposed different strategies to organize discussions in F2F or online instructions (Guiller et al., 2008) . Darabi and Jin (2013) , for example, suggested sharing example posts with students for discussions. However, how to increase interaction and promote effective discussion is still an open question.",

Research indicates that peer interactions and support correlate positively with learning outcomes (Ashwin, 2003; Chu & Chu, 2010; Lee et al., 2011) . Peer feedback, a type of learner-learner interaction, invites learners to review their peers' drafts or work in progress and provides feedback for improvement (Topping et al., 2000) . It further encourages learners to make revisions or modifications according to peer feedback (Li et al., 2010; Zhang & Toker, 2011) . Formative peer-feedback encourages learners to focus on learning rather than grades (Fluckiger et al., 2010) . Thus, it enhances the quality of students' work (Aghaee & Keller, 2016 ) and helps to build a learning community together (Rovai, 2002) . It is also effective in enhancing knowledge acquisition as found in computer science courses (Venables & Summit, 2003) . Reportedly, learners value the experience of reviewing others' work and learning from fellow students (Li et al., 2010) . Immediate feedback is critical in motivating learners (Denton et al., 2008) and increasing learners' satisfaction (Lee et al., 2011) . Otherwise, when feedback is delayed or not available, learners may lose motivation (Higgins et al., 2002) and miss opportunities to seek alternative strategies for solutions (Earley et al., 1990; Stein & Wanstreet, 2008) . Therefore, it is vital to explore feedback strategies from both instructor and peers in BL.",

In One Drive, the instructor created a folder for each student and uploaded the feedback on the assignments into each folder. In F2F sessions, the instructor summarized students' achievements and progress from the previous week and then presented new content. To create a personalized learning environment, the instructor used individual student's names and provided examples that are highly related to students' education and job backgrounds. After that, students presented their paper analysis, and the rest of the class provided feedback according to the same rubric. To ensure openness and effectiveness of peer feedback, the instructor highlighted that the peer evaluation scores would not be counted toward the final grade and constructive peer feedback was more important than just polite compliments.",

It was a great experience collaborating with students from a different university.\" The analysis of students' posts in the online debate supported the above claims. Students' debate was very organized within the group. Students in each group posted six posts in total. However, this organization limited the flexibility of expressing students' personal thoughts. The instructor reflected on the online debate assignment and noticed that the online debate activities were not well-designed. The online debate should be generated from students' personal perspectives after the reading, rather than a simple summary of the assigned reading materials. In addition, coordinating among students from two institutions in the asynchronous debate was challenging.

Thus, instructors and instructional designers should be cautious when applying the findings of this study to larger classes. Third, the interviewer and interviewees were peers with a strong rapport, which must have influenced the research in various ways. To establish trustworthiness, the researchers worked collaboratively to address possible biases and conducted interviews two months after the course had concluded.
