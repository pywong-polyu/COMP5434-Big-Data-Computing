Taking a SARS-CoV-2 specific approach to drug development is logical and was recently summarized by Kupferschmidt et al. [3] ( On March 28, 2020 the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA issued) an emergency use authorization (EUA) permitting chloroquine phosphate (medical grade) and hydroxychloroquine sulfate to be added to the strategic national stockpile (SNS) (Fig. 2) . The SNS exists under the authority of the United States Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and accepted 30 million doses of hydroxychloroquine sulfate donated by Sandoz\u2122, the Novartis\u2122 generics and biosimilars division, and one million doses of chloroquine phosphate donated by Bayer Pharmaceuticals\u2122 for potential use in treating patients who were hospitalized with COVID-19 or for use in clinical trials. In addition to the SNS donations, these companies and potentially others could offer additional doses (www. fda.gov). There was an expectation that companies would increase production for the commercial market as well to avoid shortages for patients with autoimmune disease who rely on hydroxychloroquine sulfate (Plaquenil\u00ae) for routine treatment [4] .",

The QT interval represents the period of ventricular depolarization (QRS interval) and repolarization (ST interval). It is corrected for the heart rate and referred to as the QTc interval. Prolongation of repolarization is caused by an increase of inward current through sodium or calcium channels or a decrease in outward current through potassium channels. The normal value in adults is 470 ms in men and 480 ms in women. The normal QTc interval is shorter in children. A sudden prolongation of QTc interval (greater than 20-30% above baseline) or an absolute value > 500 ms increases the risk for ventricular tachycardia that can be life-threatening. Other intervals, including the PR (atrial depolarization and conduction leading up to ventricular depolarization) are shown HCoV-OC43-induced death in newborn mice.

Mobilize research on rapid point of care diagnostics for use at the community level-this is critical to be able to quickly identify sick people, treat them and better estimate how widely the virus has spread 2. Immediately assess available data to learn what standard of care approaches from China and elsewhere are the most effective-there is an imperative to optimize standard of care given to patients at different stages of the disease and take advantages of all available technological innovations to improve survival and recovery 3. Evaluate as fast as possible the effect of adjunctive and supportive therapies-The global research community need to understand what other adjunctive treatments than currently being used are at our disposal that may help with the standard of care provided to patients, including the quick evaluation of interventions such as steroids and high flow oxygen 4. Optimize use of protective equipment and other infection prevention and control measures in health care and community settings-It is critical to protect health care workers and the community from transmission and create a safe working environment 5. Review all evidence available to identify animal host(s), to prevent continued spill over and to better understand the virus transmissibility in different contexts over time, the severity of disease and who is more susceptible to infection-Understanding transmission dynamics would help us appreciate the full spectrum of the disease, in terms of at risk groups, and conditions that make the disease more severe as well as the effectiveness of certain public health interventions 6. Accelerate the evaluation of investigational therapeutics and vaccines by using \"Master Protocols\"-Rapidly developing master protocols for clinical trials will accelerate the potential to assess what works and what does not, improve collaboration and comparison across different studies, streamline ethics review and optimize the evaluation of new investigational drugs, vaccines and diagnostics 7. Maintain a high degree of communication and interaction among funders so that critical research is implemented-Funders reiterated their current financial commitments to tackling this outbreak and agreed that the priorities agreed at the Forum would help to coordinate existing investments and inform mobilization of additional resources in the coming days, weeks and months 8. Broadly and rapidly share virus materials, clinical samples and data for immediate public health purposes-It was agreed that virus materials, clinical samples and associated data should be rapidly shared for immediate public health purposes and that fair and equitable access to any medical products or innovations that are developed using the materials must be part of such sharing",

Its scope and impact on health, well-being, economic stability and daily life is tragic, heart-breaking and quite personal. Despite an honest and natural human response to a clear threat, this is not a time for reactions; this is not a time for assumptions; this is not a time for desperate measures; this is not a time for guessing what might be a safe and effective treatment. This is a time for facts, measured steps, thoughtful responses and collaborations without borders. This is without question a time to follow the scientific evidence.",

At each of the MOIs (0.01, 0.02, 0.2, and 0.8), the 50% maximal effective concentration (EC 50 ) for hydroxychloroquine was 4.51, 4.06, 17.31, and 12.96 \u03bcM, respectively. The findings were corroborated by immunofluorescence microscopy by assessing different expression levels of virus nucleoprotein at the indicated drug concentrations at 48 h post-infection. Gautret and colleagues [31] performed a single arm, open-label clinical study over a 2-week period. A total of 20 Covid-19 confirmed patients (6 asymptomatic, 22 upper respiratory tract symptoms and 8 lower respiratory tract symptoms) received hydroxychloroquine 600 mg daily. By day 6, there was decreased viral load carriage in treated patients compared to untreated patients derived from the medical literature. The effects of hydroxychloroquine were reinforced by the addition of azithromycin.",
