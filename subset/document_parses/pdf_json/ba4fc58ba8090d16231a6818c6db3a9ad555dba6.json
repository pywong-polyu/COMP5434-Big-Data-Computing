            "text": "The rapid outbreak of coronavirus threatens humans' life all around the world. Due to the insufficient diagnostic infrastructures, developing an accurate, efficient, inexpensive, and quick diagnostic tool is of great importance. To date, researchers have proposed several detection models based on chest imaging analysis, primarily based on deep neural networks; however, none of which could achieve a reliable and highly sensitive performance yet. Therefore, the nature of this study is primary epidemiological research that aims to overcome the limitations mentioned above by proposing a large-scale publicly available dataset of chest computed tomography scan (CT-scan) images consisting of more than 13k samples. Secondly, we propose a more sensitive deep neural networks model for CT-scan images of the lungs, providing a pixel-wise attention layer on top of the high-level features extracted from the network. Moreover, the proposed model is extended through a transfer learning approach for being applicable in the case of chest X-Ray (CXR) images. The proposed model and its extension have been trained and evaluated through several experiments. The inclusion criteria were patients with suspected PE and positive real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for SARS-CoV-2. The exclusion criteria were negative or inconclusive RT-PCR and other chest CT indications. Our model achieves an AUC score of 0.886, significantly better than its closest competitor, whose AUC is 0.843. Moreover, the obtained results on another commonly-used benchmark show an AUC of 0.899, outperforming related models. Additionally, the sensitivity of our model is 0.858, while that of its closest competitor is 0.81, explaining the efficiency of pixel-wise attention strategy in detecting coronavirus. Our promising results and the efficiency of the models imply that the proposed models can be considered reliable tools for assisting doctors in detecting coronavirus.",

COVNET consumes several lungs' images at the same time and feeds each of which into a separated backend of RESNET-50 16 whose weights are shared between its backends. The main limitation of COVNET, however, is a high level of computation with a low level of sensitivity. Hybrid-3D 17 is another deep screening network that builds the 3D shape of lungs and then feeds both 2D and 3D inputs into two Densnet backbones 18 and combines their predictions. However, its prediction is dependent on the accuracy of the estimated 3D shape of the lungs. Apart from that, the 3D estimation imposes a heavy computation, resulting in a lower screening speed. Unet++ 19 , on the other hand, is computationally better than others. However, it does not satisfy the sensitivity requirements, i.e., the chance of false-negative is high. Table 3 summarizes the performances of these models on CT-COV19, which is a public benchmark. Detailed information about datasets and other related methods can be explored in [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . One of the main limitations of the current deep learning models is the size of datasets being used for learning the models, i.e., the number of publicly available training samples used for optimizing parameters. To the best of our knowledge, current models have been trained on small-sized datasets, mostly due to privacy concerns and the unavailability of COVID-19 CXR/CT images 25, 26 . Consequently, it does lead to a lower generalization ability of the trained models 27 . Age and regional diversities are two other essential factors [28] [29] [30] , playing a vital role in the generalization of the learned models and preventing the models from the danger of overfitting. As elderly people are at a higher risk of being infected by the coronavirus, current public datasets of COVID-19 are often biased towards older people, resulting in a lower chance of generalization for younger patients. Additionally, people of different regional backgrounds are not necessarily common in their lung functioning, respiration abilities, and several other breathing factors 31 . Hence, if a dataset is built based on the samples provided by one hospital/city, the models learned on such datasets would be very likely to become biased toward that specific region. The lack of sensitivity in predictions is another critical limitation of the current deep neural models, causing less reliable detection. In other words, it is currently very likely to predict a positive sample as a negative, particularly during the incubation period of disease when there are no clear patterns of infection in the lungs.",

Accordingly, this study, firstly, builds a publicly available CT-scan dataset of COVID-19, consisting of 13k CT-images captured from more than 1000 individuals. The images are collected from four regions with entirely different climate conditions. A wide range of age diversities has also been included, ages varying from 19 to 73. Additionally, images are saved at a high level of quality. Overall, the proposed dataset, named CT-COV19, provides a reliable set of CT-scan images for the researchers to develop more accurate and general models. Secondly, the present study suggests a novel deep neural model, i.e., Deep-CT-Net, trained on the proposed CT-COV19 dataset and provides baseline results. Deep-CT-Net benefits from a simple but accurate architecture, enabling the possibility of early screening the infection patterns of COVID-19 from the CT-images of lungs. More precisely, the proposed model takes advantage of pyramidal attention layers 32 , providing pixel-wise attention on top of the extracted high-level features and, consequently, enabling the whole model to accurately detect COVID-19 even when there are less symptoms of the disease in the lungs. The pixel-wise attention empowers the final model to detect more positive cases whose primary swabs are negative. Furthermore, having no heavy pre-processing steps, such as lungs segmentation 17, 33 , is another virtue of the proposed network, enabling the model to detect COVID-19 in a lower computational time. This property is particularly desirable during the waves of COVID-19, as the detection process becomes much faster than those models containing the pre-processing steps.",

Another aspect of CT-COV19 is the existence of samples from other pneumonia, providing learning algorithms with an opportunity to distinguish between infections caused by COVID-19 and other lung diseases. Table 1 provides a brief comparison between CT-COV19 and several other similar datasets, explaining the quantitative superiority of CT-COV19 to others. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ CT-COV19 consists of CT-scan images from three different labels, including COVID-19, other pneumonia, and normal with the ratios of 61.5%, 5.8%, 32.7% , respectively. Although the number of samples belonging to the class of other pneumonia is small, one can easily find plenty of such samples via the Internet. In this study, we deliberately merge the labels of other pneumonia with all samples of normal class and consider the merged set as the normal class. Therefore, CT-COV19 is generally a two classes dataset. This dataset, which now has two classes, i.e., COVID and Normal, is further randomly divided into train, validation, and test parts with ratios of 70%, 10%, and 20%, respectively. Table 2 summarizes this division. The minimum and maximum heights/widths of images are respectively 484 \u00d7 484 and 1024 \u00d7 1024 .

Finally, a pooling layer aggregates their outputs. Although the weights are shared, the computational time/cost is high in www.nature.com/scientificreports/ practice. COVNET reports a sensitivity of 0.81 and an AUC of 0.842 over CT-COV19. Similarly, DL-system 35 is computationally complex. It uses three main stages: lungs' segmentation, segment suppression, and prediction, consuming high level of computation. Moreover, it uses 3D convolutions, which even need more computational power. Another limitation is that the prediction accuracy becomes dependent on the segmentation accuracy, causing this model to be not operational in practice. Overall, DL-system reports the lowest accuracy in prediction, i.e., 0.75 of sensitivity and 0.804 of AUC over CT-COV19. Hybrid-3D 17 works in a similar approach to DL-system. It first segments lungs and then applies Densnet-121 for classification. Although its performance is better than DL-system, it still suffers from the same limitations of DL-system. Hybrid-3D reports a sensitivity of 0.797 and an AUC of 0.843 over CT-COV19. CAAD 11 , which is a CXR model, suggests an anomaly detection loss on an This work is significant from three main perspectives. First, we built a publicly available dataset of CT-images of COVID-19 that is large and diverse enough to train reliable models and, therefore, can be considered for training and evaluation in future studies. Second, the proposed deep neural networks can extract pixel-wise information accurately and, thus, detect COVID-19 with higher accuracy. That is why Deep-CT-Net and Deep-CXR-Net www.nature.com/scientificreports/ achieve higher rates of sensitivities than other related methods. For instance, the closest method to Deep-CT-Net, in terms of sensitivities on CT-COV19, is COVNET with a value of 0.81, while that of Deep-CT-Net is 0.858. The same observation can be seen from the obtained results over COVID-CT, in which the sensitivity rate achieved by Deep-CT-Net is 0.905, while that of the closest related method, i.e., xDNN 37 , is 0.886. Third, the proposed Deep-CXR-Net, which is the CXR extension of Deep-CT-Net, is able to be trained on small-sized CXR datasets and efficiently compensate for the lack of enough CXR data of COVID-19. Compared with other CXR-based deep models, we found that the choice of using additional features results in much better performances for unseen CXR data and significantly reduces the rate of false-positive. In contrast, other methods have shown higher falsepositive rates in their predictions, i.e., they wrongly tend to predict samples of other pneumonia as COVID-19.",

For instance, the models in Refs. 17, 33 are based on complex lung segmentation steps, imposing more computational cost in practice and limiting the final screening results to the segmentation accuracy. Being efficient and accurate, the proposed models have the potential to be used in hospitals' emergency rooms. Accordingly, a regular computer equipped with an ordinary Nvidia graphic card can be connected to the imaging system, either CT-scan or CXR, making the prediction in a fraction of a second.

The experimental results show that: (1) the choice of pyramidal attention layers can significantly increase the sensitivity rate, increasing the overall prediction metrics, i.e., AUCs, and (2) the proposed Deep-CT-Net is likely to have more false positives in favour of having a lower rate of false negatives.

As it is shown, Deep-CT-Net consists of three main parts. The first part applies Densnet-121 18 as the backbone, extracting high-level features from the input raw CT-images. The second part performs a pyramid attention layer 32 over the extracted high-level features to maximize pixelwise feature extraction, allowing the model to detect COVID-19 even during the first days of infection. A batch normalization layer, which standardizes the input to the next layer, is then used to avoid internal covariance shifts 47 and have a smoother objective function 48 .

More accurately, the proposed Deep-CXR-Net consists of three main parts, where the first two parts are independent pre-trained models respectively on two large-sized datasets of non-COVID diseases of lungs, i.e., CheXpert 50 and Kaggle-Pneumonia 51 . We consider these parts as two black-box functions whose inputs are CXR images, and the outputs are vectors of high-level features. More precisely, for a given CXR image, the output of the first part is a six-dimensional vector whose entries are the likelihood of six certain lung diseases, documented in Ref. 50 . Besides, the output of the second part is a two-dimensional vector, representing the likelihood of having pneumonia or not. These additional features compensate for the scarcity of CXR data in COVID-19, increasing the generalization ability of the Deep-CXR-Net. The last part, i.e., Part 3, is another deep network, concatenating all the extracted features, i.e., the extracted features of itself and those from parts one and two. This concatenation is the point where the idea of transfer learning comes to play. More precisely, the additional concatenated features provided by Parts 1 and 2 compensate for the lack of having enough CXR training samples of COVID-19, resulting in a high level of generalization during the test time. We use ieee8023 46 as a COVID-labeled dataset to train the parameters of the third part. Additionally, a certain number of image augmentation techniques, such as rotation and translation (explained above), have also been applied in the learning phase. As parts 1 and 2 are pre-trained models, the backward pass only updates the weight parameters of the third part using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-5 to minimize the binary-cross-entropy loss. As Fig. 3 shows, the backbone applied in all three parts is DensNet-121. Similar to Deep-CT-Net, the proposed Deep-CXR-Net uses a pyramidal attention layer 32 to provide pixel-wise attention on high-level features, enabling the whole model to effectively detect COVID-19 cases even when there are small clues of the disease in lungs.",
