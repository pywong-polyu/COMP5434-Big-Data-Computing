From fundamental and practical perspective, TiO 2 has become one of the most wanted nano material 7-10 due to its photo and chemical stability, tunable electronic, optical, surface and structural properties, being easily available, reusable and less toxic. But, large scale applications of titania has always been limited due to its inefficient absorption of Sun light owing to its wider band gap energy. The advantages and disadvantages of homogeneous as well as heterogeneous catalysis paves a basic necessity of a new system, which ought to be vibrant as homogeneous catalysis, also efficiently regainable as heterogeneous catalysis 11 . Studies have been focused to overcome this limitation by tuning their crystallite, surface and optical characteristics via novel alternatives like making use of chemical and bio material templates, metal/non-metal doping and blending of different light absorbing materials 12 . Doping of metals like Ag, Ni, Co, Au, Cu, V, Fe, Mg 13 were already reported by scientists on tailoring the electronic, surface, thermal and crystalline nature and non-metals like C 14 , N 15 , F 16 , S 17 for causing red shift thereby enabling visible light active photo catalytic degradation of organic pollutants.",

Congo red in water bodies is highly undesirable being carcinogenic, and should be eliminated. In this study the visible light photo catalytic ability of nano titania samples was expected to be very remarkable by simultaneous influence of bio templates and calcination in causing bathochromic shift (red shift) of absorption of light. This may result in successful, highly profitable and novel approach to harness solar energy for scientific projects like visible light bioremediation of waste water. This principle is projected to be more preferable in hot countries like India. The prominent impact of calcination in increasing crystallite size, narrowing band gap energy, eliminating irregularities and strain 31 was noted and verified.",

It is observed that, with the increase in calcination temperature the formation of thermodynamically stable rutile phase is favored, and has taken place gradually not abruptly. It is supposed to be due to the transformation of elongated side-to-side packed anatase phase to closed packed octahedraly oriented rutile phase 33 . Also it is noted that as the calcination temperature increased, due to phase transformation the intensities of the peaks corresponding to anatase phase decreased and vice versa. From Table 1 , it is noted that with the increase in calcination temperature crystallite size is also increased. This is because at higher calcination temperature the formed crystallites are of larger size, which is attributed by the removal of irregularities, edges, defects etc. during heat treatment and therefore resulting in well-defined crystalline phase 34, 35 . The average size of the synthesized nano titania samples NT1,NT2 and NT3 calcined at 400 \u00b0C, 600 \u00b0C and 800 \u00b0C were reported to be 18, 21.4 and 28.6 nm calculated using Debye-Scherrer formula (D = k\u03bb/\u03b2 cos \u03b8) 36 and was correlating well with the size determined from TEM analysis 37 .",

It is found that A-R phase transition has occurred after 400 \u00b0C and continued even after 800 \u00b0C 26, 38 . The recorded values of rutile phase percentage were 0, 25.8 and 94.6%, respectively for NT1, NT2 and NT3 (Fig. 3) , thus A-R phase transition is almost near the completion at 800 \u00b0C. DRS-UV-visible spectra analysis. Figure 5 shows the diffuse reflectance spectrum of templated titania samples. The absorption edge of a synthesized catalysts has shown a remarkable shift from UV to visible region. In the case of NT it appeared at 386 nm and for NT1 at 463 nm. This bathochromic shift (red shift), i.e. shifting of absorption edge towards longer wavelength, might be due to the delocalization of molecular orbitals in the least unoccupied conduction band of semiconductor metal oxides 43 . The above result is sustained from the band gap energy data observed from the Tauc plot (Fig. 6 ). The band gap energy of NT and NT1 samples were found to be at 2.86 and 2.44 eV, respectively, therefore in the case of NT1, the rate of recombination of excitons got lowered and thus increased the rate of photocatalysis overall. The above results inferred that NT1 could work as a visible light active photo catalyst in the degradation of organic pollutants and also it showed better results among the catalysts synthesized as shown in the analysis of photo catalytic efficiency analysis (Fig. 11 ).",

From BET analysis it is inferred that all the synthesized samples exhibited the Type III adsorption isotherms 44 , with typical H3 hysteresis loop due to capillary condensation on the surface of mesoporous materials 45 . The enhanced mesoporosity of the templated nano titania samples compared to NT was validated This was in good agreement with the fact that lower the crystallite size greater will be the surface area of the metal oxide catalysts 46 . The deviation from the above fact in the case of other titania samples might be due to higher rate of agglomeration and lack of irregularities and defects on the catalyst's surface because of calcination 47 . Moreover, the crystallite size derived from BET examination using the expression, D BET = 6000/S BET \u00d7 D XRD nm, was found to be in well concurrence with the same that is assessed from the XRD pattern 48 . From the pore size distribution it was clear that the pores of the catalysts (Fig. 8) were narrow, bi modal and in the range from 11.5 to 13.5 nm. To summarize the impact of leaf extract as an effective template in the synthesis of mesoporous titania along with heat treatment resulted in expanded desorption isotherm, moderate porosity and narrowed pore size of NT1, is quite evident from its photo catalytic activity 49 .",

From the SEM analysis as shown in Fig. 10 , the influence of a template on the morphology of titania nano particles has been verified. Among the templated titania samples NT1 showed moderate porosity, lowered agglomeration and well-dispersed nano clusters with inter www.nature.com/scientificreports/ crystalline pores, hence better morphology in comparison to other synthesized samples got reflected in its photocatalytic activity. Thus it is evident that lowered agglomeration reduce the crystallite size of the catalyst as observed in the BET surface area analysis. NT2 and NT3 samples have shown higher rate of agglomeration and therefore decrease in the crystallite size 51 . It is clearly noted that all the templated titania particles with grains of unequal sizes and uniformly distributed voids on the surface may bring out greater adsorption and hence better photo catalytic activity. Moreover uniformly distributed nano particles in the sample NT1 catalyst lead to better adsorption and hence good photo catalytic activity 52 . The elemental analysis of NT2 was inspected using EDAX spectrum as shown in Fig. 11 . The EDAX spectrum clearly indicated the presence of peaks due to titania and oxygen 53 , which suggested the removal of organic residue like carbon from the template in the calcined NT1. The intense signal at 4.5 and 4.9 keV indicates that Ti is the major component of the sample 29 . The absence of peaks due to other elements clearly confirmed the purity of synthesized NT1 sample. Fig. 12a , it is observed that the of templated titania particles calcined at 400 \u00b0C namely NT1 were with lowered agglomeration and indefinite shape in turn paved way for high stability in aqueous suspension 50 . Variation in the particle size was ranging about 18-28.8 nm, which was in good agreement with the XRD result analysis that as the calcination temperature increased crystallite size also increased reflecting on grain growth 54 . The particle size distribution of NT1 with respect to TEM analysis is shown in the Fig. 13 . Highly resolved lattice plane fringes of anatase phase is shown in the Fig. 12b . SAED pattern of NT1 exhibited well defined ring patterns that were of typical anatase phase TiO 2, substantiated the purity as well as the crystallinity of the synthesized nano particles 55 . The highly www.nature.com/scientificreports/ crystallite size. This might be due to synergistic effect of anatase-rutile phases present in the sample, in extending the energy band gap and thereby increasing the retention of electron-hole pair life time and also producing more OH radicals on the surface 34 . Figure 15 , a UV-Vis spectra acquired from the photo degradation of Congo red using irradiated NT1 sample as a photo catalyst shows the decrease in the absorbance with the continuous removal of Congo red from the solution 57 . Thus elimination of chromophores of a pollutant in the visible region accompanied with the loss of benzene and naphthalene groups in the UV region has shown decrease in intensity and also the disappearance of bands with time 58 . The complete decolouration was noticed within 180 min due to partial degradation of pollutants and is indicated by a sharp intensed absorption edge 59 .",

When a catalyst absorbs photon of energy equal to or greater than its band gap energy, pair of (h + , e \u2212 ) generated thus move to the surface of a photocatalyst. This may either recombine or undergo redox reaction to degrade the pollutants in the aqueous medium. The electron and hole in the semiconductor surface react with the acceptor (step c) or donor (step d) respectively or may recombine at the trapped sites on the surface (steps a & b) . Finally, the efficiency of a photocatalytic reaction is determined by the charge carriers, holes and electrons. Figure 16 shows whether the dye was only photo leached or photo degraded from the total organic content estimated using 20 \u00b5M Congo red solution and irradiated NT1. The 100% decolouration and about 80% reduction in the carbon content by 180 min was noted from the solar light induced process. The graphical abstract clearly explain the tentative mechanism of Congo red degradation in visible light region. On irradiation of NT1, valence band electron gets excited and moved to conduction band resulting on electron-hole pair. These excitons are responsible for the generation of active species like OH, \u00b7O 2-, which in turn decompose Congo red into CO 2 , H 2 O and NO 3 etc. 43 . This showed the partial degradation of dye to a profitable extent using a catalyst.",

The degradation percentage got increased from 51.5 to 92.8%, when the amount of catalyst was increased from 0.1 to 0.5 g l \u22121 , resulted in more active sites available on the catalyst surface which in turn enhanced the absorption of light for better photo degradation 61 . There was a decrease in the rate of degradation of the dye when the catalyst dose was increased further beyond 0.5 g l \u22121 , due to aggregation of catalyst particles that would block the pores of a catalyst and hence the extent of penetration of light 62 . Hence, 0.5 g l \u22121 loading of NT1 was found to be optimum under current experimental conditions for the photo catalytic degradation of Congo red. Figure 19 shows the effect of pH on the rate of photo degradation under varying range of the pH of the solution from 3 to 10 and other experimental factors were kept constant. The degradation of aqueous Congo red solution increased from 85.2 to about 93.4% when pH of the solution was increased from 3 to 5 and the same got decreased to 69.1% at pH = 10. The zero point charge of titania is around 6.8 and hence its surface remain to be acidic, positively charged due to protonation below this pH. It would become basic, negatively charged because of deprotonation, above this pH 63 . During photodegradation in acidic medium (low pH) the anionic Congo red, as a strong Lewis base got adsorbed easily on the positive titania surface 64 . But in alkaline medium, the extent of adsorption got reduced due to negative surface charge of titania and thus resulted in lessened degradation 63 .",

            "text": "Effect of initial dye concentration on the degradation of Congo red and kinetic studies. Figure 20 shows that when concentration the dye increased from 20 to 50 \u00b5M, the initial rate of photo catalytic degradation decreased. This is because as the initial dye concentration increased, saturation of the active sites due to more availability of pollutants on the surface of titania takes place. Also the presence of more number of dye molecules in the bulk solution might have absorbed the radiation, and therefore less number of OH radicals were made available on the surface of the catalyst and subsequently the degradation percentage of the organic substrate was reduced 65 . Figure 21 represents the pseudo-first order kinetics of photo catalytic degradation of Congo red with respect to the dye concentration. In a plot of \u2212 ln (C/C\u25cb) versus t, a linear relation between the dye concentration and www.nature.com/scientificreports/ irradiation time has been observed where C\u25cb is the equilibrium concentration of the dye and C is the concentration at time t. The first order rate constant was estimated as 0.0154 min \u22121 using the rate expression \u2212 ln [C/ C\u25cb] = k\u2032t 63 . Figure 22 gives the quantum yield percentage of NT and NT1 samples, Degussa-25 and blank solution with respect to hydrogen ion formation. It is interesting to note the progressive increase in the H 2 ion production and therefore the stability of quantum yield throughout the cycle. It is observed that at pH = 4, due to protonation no decrease in the rate of hydrogen ion supply to the catalyst's surface and hence better photocatalytic effect in the acidic medium 66 . Of all synthesized samples NT1 has shown maximum quantum yield of 5.3. From Fig. 23 , the reusability of NT1 was examined to study the efficacy and stability of the synthesized nano titania catalyst. A catalyst was collected, filtered, also washed repeatedly with distilled water and dried at 60-70 \u00b0C in an oven, at the end of photo catalytic process. The reclaimed catalyst was employed minimum for five cycles for the photo degradation of Congo red repeatedly. Only a negligible reduction in the photo catalytic efficiency was observed up to four times of recycling. This verified that during the repeated recycling and reuse of synthesized photo catalyst it was found to be stable, efficient, and relatively unaffected. Marginal decrease in the activity of the regained synthesized samples during repeated recycling might be due to the removal of active species from the catalyst's surface during washing and recovery processes 67 .

The profound influence of calcination along with an organic template is evidenced from the optical, crystallite surface and morphological properties of synthesized titania samples. Among the titania samples prepared NT1 (calcined at 400 \u00b0C), of only anatase phase, with maximum surface area (98.6 m 2 g \u22121 ) and minimum crystallite size (18 nm) has exhibited 97.7% photo degradation of Congored in the visible light region due to bathochromic shift resulted in. The sample NT2 (calcined at 600 \u00b0C) of both anatase and rutile phases also displayed excellent photo degradation about 96.5% against Congored under Sun light, clearly indicated the synergistic effect of mixed phases in extending the absorption edge to the visible light region. Thus to summarize, the observed experimental results of the present work highlighted the significant impact of calcination in tuning photo catalytic ability of bio-templated titania samples which can be further explored in the field of sensing, drug delivery, self-cleaning and anti-fouling coatings in future apart from photo catalytic applications.",
