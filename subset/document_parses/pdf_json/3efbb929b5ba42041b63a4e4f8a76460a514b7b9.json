The International Infection Control Program at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published companion operational considerations documents [6] to assist healthcare facilities to implement WHO IPC guidance. Given the quantity of guidance created and the rapid need for implementation advice, a platform with broad reach was needed. Our team designed a webinar series (the IPC Global Webinar Series), which was a platform to not only quickly disseminate global guidance and operation considerations, but also where peer-to-peer experiences on implementing IPC best practices to contain the spread of COVID-19 could be shared. This platform could help close the gap between subject matter experts and frontline IPC professionals and public health practitioners in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

The ECHO case-based virtual community of practice learning model has since been adapted to meet a variety of priority healthcare workforce development needs.

Sessions were held Thursday mornings (Eastern Daylight Time). The first session was held on Thursday, May 14, 2020. CDC collaborated with the IPC Hub and Task Force at WHO to co-produce the series given the global focus of the sessions. Speakers and panelists for the webinar included personnel from CDC, WHO headquarters and regional offices, United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), Ministries of Health, academic institutions, and humanitarian institutions. IPC professional societies around the globe, such as the Brazilian Association of Professionals in Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology (ABIH), Infection Control Africa Network (ICAN), and the Asian Pacific Society of Infection Control (APSIC) also contributed to the series. The webinar series was announced via flyers in different languages-English, French, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. We did not have program staff available to translate the flyers into Arabic, though we were able to provide live interpretation to Arabic during the sessions.

Emphasis was placed on adapting the guidance and recommendations to the local context, including approaches to minimize possible barriers. Panelists provided additional expertise and perspective during the panel discussion by answering questions submitted in advance by participants during registration or submitted live during the session. For each webinar, two moderators welcomed participants, introduced speakers and panelists, assisted with timekeeping, facilitated the panel discussion, and administered polling questions to participants. Three to five pop-up polling questions (closed responses: yes/no or multiple choice) were prepared for each session to gauge current practices related to the session's topic. Participants responded to each polling question on their device (i.e., smartphone, laptop or desktop computer), and responses were automatically tabulated anonymously. After each polling question, moderators discussed the responses and provided additional clarity and commentary. Participants submitted questions during the session through the Question and Answer feature (Q&A), where a team of subject-matter experts from CDC and WHO and the session's speakers and panelists could type answers. Submitted questions were answered in English, Portuguese, French, and Spanish-CDC program staff fluent in each of these languages were available to participate in the sessions and answer questions that came in through the Q&A feature. . The team responsible for monitoring the Q&A during the session would inform session moderators if any submitted questions should be answered during the panel discussion. Participants utilized the Chat feature for any questions or comments on logistics or connectivity. The University of New Mexico School of Medicine, Office of Continuing Medical Education provided Continuing Medical Education (CME) credit for each session-the ECHO institute is based at the University of New Mexico. At the end of each session, participants could provide qualitative feedback via a voluntary CME survey through a hyperlink provided in the Chat feature. CME responses were used for continuous improvement of the sessions. Sessions were recorded in each of the six audio languages and posted on the ECHO website (https://echo.unm.edu/covid-19/sessions/cdc-ipc) for later viewing by participants.",
