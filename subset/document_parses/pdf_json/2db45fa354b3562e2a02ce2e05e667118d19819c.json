            "text": "Inflammation is a biological response of the immune system to defend the body from negative stimulation. However, the excessive inflammatory response can damage host tissues and pose serious threats. Exopolysaccharide (EPS), one of the postbiotics, is secreted from lactic acid bacteria. Although many studies have described the beneficial effects of EPS, such as its anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidant effects, its underlying mechanisms have remained to be poorly understood. Thus, we identified that EPS obtained from Lactobacillus plantarum L-14 was a homogeneous polysaccharide primarily comprised of glucose. To examine these anti-inflammatory effects, an inflammatory response was induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) administration to mouse macrophage RAW 264.7 cells that were pretreated with EPS. The anti-inflammatory effects of EPS were identified by analyzing the changes within inflammatory markers at the molecular level. We demonstrate here that EPS suppressed proinflammatory mediators, such as cyclooxygenase-2, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and interleukin-1\u03b2, and downregulated the expression of an inducible nitric oxide synthase known to lead to oxidative stress. It was also confirmed that EPS had anti-inflammatory effects by blocking the interaction of LPS with Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), as demonstrated by using the known TLR4 inhibitor TAK-242. In addition, we found that EPS itself could suppress the expression of TLR4. Consequently, our data suggest that EPS can be a potential target for the development of natural product-derived medicine for treating inflammatory diseases related to TLR4.",

Interestingly, when RAW 264.7 cells were treated with EPS only, the protein expression of TLR4 was more repressed than that of the no treatment control group ( Figure 7B ).

As a result, TLR4 upregulated by LPS was reduced by EPS at all concentrations ( Figure 7A ). In addition, the manner in which EPS interacted with TLR4 was confirmed using TAK-242, which has been determined to block the TLR4 pathway. Interestingly, when RAW 264.7 cells were treated with EPS only, the protein expression of TLR4 was more repressed than that of the no treatment control group ( Figure 7B ). EPS also inhibited the expression levels of TLR4 and MyD88 in LPS-induced groups, similar to that observed in the TAK-242-treated group. The expression of COX-2 was inhibited by TAK-242 and was inhibited by EPS in the same way. Consistently, EPS significantly reduced the expression of the secreted cytokines IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in the media as much as TAK-242 downregulated them ( Figure 7C ).

            "text": "When LPS binds to TLR4, the interaction can induce an inflammatory response and oxidative stress by NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathway in the host cells [7] . TLR4 signaling is divided into two pathways, that is, the MyD88-dependent pathway and TIR-domain-containing adapter-inducing interferon-\u03b2 (TRIF)-dependent pathway, of which the mutual interaction generates a complicated inflammation response [34] . TNF-\u03b1 expression induced by LPS is regulated through both MyD88 and TRIF pathways, whereas NF-\u03baB is primarily activated through a MyD88-dependent pathway [35] . Our results have shown that EPS has inhibited the expression of TNF-\u03b1 and NF-\u03baB following their activation by LPS (Figures 4A and 5) . In some recent research, it was shown that LPS accumulated in the brain neurons of patients with Alzheimer's disease and inhibited the efficient readout of neuronal genetic information for the homeostasis of brain cell function by contributing to inflammatory degeneration in human neuronal-glial cells [36] . Rathinam et al. showed that TLR4-deficient mice did not develop an immune response following injections of LPS at high concentrations, which only suggests that the inflammatory reaction caused by LPS may be completely regulated through TLR4 pathway [37] . EPS obtained from LAB could be divided into homopolysaccharide (HoPS) composed of the same monosaccharides and heteropolysaccharide consists of various monosaccharides [16] . In particular, HoPS is polymerized from monosaccharides such as glucose or fructose by glycosyl hydrolase activity and released out from the cell [38] . HoPS is produced through either intracellular synthesis, which undergoes several metabolic pathways or extracellular synthesis, which is released immediately after polymerization. Therefore, HoPS has different ligands depending on the methods it is made. These complex structural properties contribute to the biological function, characteristics, or beneficial effects of EPS. EPS isolated L-14 was identified as HoPS mainly composed of glucose ( Figure 2B-D) . The PDI of EPS was calculated as 4.12, and EPS changed the color of the Benedict solution to green, indicating that EPS contained a small amount of glucose. (Figure 2C,E) . These results confirmed that EPS is a broad polydisperse polysaccharide composed of monosaccharides of glucose. Interestingly, our results showed that EPS isolated from L-14 significantly inhibited the expression of proinflammatory markers-including IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, and COX-2-induced by LPS, indicating that EPS suppressed the TLR4 pathway (Figures 4 and 7A ). In addition, our findings have confirmed that EPS inhibited the activation of TLR4 by LPS, as demonstrated by TAK-242 treatment ( Figure 7B ,C). When cells were treated with both EPS and TAK-242, TLR4 and proinflammatory mediators were not more repressed than when cells were treated with either agent independently. These results suggested the possibility that EPS inhibits the inflammatory response via a mechanism similar to that of TAK-242. TLR4 directly binds to not only LPS but also products of gram-positive bacteria such as EPS and lipoteichoic acid. Recently, it was reported that the EPS produced by Bifidobacterium animalis was able to interact with TLR4 of intestinal epithelial cells [39] . Nevertheless, it is necessary to elaborate in detail what structure of EPS from L-14 has and whether the ligand of EPS directly binds to TLR4 like TAK-242. Anti-cytokine therapy has been widely used to treat immune diseases in the last decade [40] . Such approved drugs include inhibitors of TNF-\u03b1 (e.g., etanercept and adalimumab), IL-6 (e.g., tocilizumab), and IL-1\u03b2 (e.g., canakinumab) signaling for immune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease [41] . Surprisingly, proinflammatory cytokines are also found to be highly expressed in major depression disorder (MDD) patients [42] ; in particular, TNF-\u03b1 stimulates the development of MDD by changing the function and structure of the brain [43] . In randomized trials for MDD treatment, depressive symptoms were shown to decrease by up to 43.8% after taking anti-TNF-\u03b1 agents (i.e., etanercept, adalimumab, and golimumab) [44] . Furthermore, IL-1\u03b2 is known as the major cytokine contributing to cardiac ischemia reperfusion injury due to activation through the inflammasome. Cytokines present in the myocardium, including IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, have even resulted in life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias through modulation of potassium and calcium channels [45] . Administration of anti-IL-1\u03b2 monoclonal antibody reduced the relative risk of major adverse cardiovascular events by up to 25%, in addition to the 31% decline in cardiovascular and overall mortality in patients with a history of myocardial infarction [46] . However, injection of therapeutic monoclonal antibody has commonly resulted in adverse reactions, including infections and reactions at the injection site [47] . Our experiment showed that EPS can effectively reduce the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines without cytotoxicity in macrophages (Figures 3B and 4) . The inflammatory response of macrophages can promote the development of the innate and adaptive immune response by complex interactions with other immune cells, including natural killer cells and dendritic cells [48] . EPS could be used to inhibit inflammatory reactions in macrophages and further treat diseases caused by unregulated inflammatory reactions through oral intake.",

            "text": "EPS has been determined to upregulate the expression of NRF2/HO-1 and consequently decreased iNOS, a known producer of nitric oxide (NO), one of reactive oxygen species (ROS), in LPS-induced macrophages ( Figure 4B ,C and Figure 6B ,C). Oxidative stress often results in the damage of DNA and proteins, mitochondrial dysfunction, and apoptosis, which can lead to age-related diseases such as chronic inflammatory diseases and cancer [49] . Additionally, excessive ROS causing oxidative stress in cells are considered as risks and enhancer factors for chronic inflammatory diseases [50] . The activation of the anti-oxidant molecules NRF2/HO-1 exhibited a clinical benefit through anti-oxidant effects in animal models with rheumatoid arthritis [51] . Recently, it has been reported that symptoms of neurodegenerative diseases deteriorated when deficiency of NRF2 increased neuroinflammation and oxidative stress in mice [52] . Additionally, it was reported that oxidative stress can be provoked by activating the MAPK pathway, since the members of the ROS and MAPK families can positively regulate each other [53] . For example, hydrogen peroxide treatment increases the expression of genes that can activate the MAPK pathway; likewise, oxidative stress was suppressed via treatment with the MAPK inhibitors PD98059 (ERK inhibitor) and SB203580 (p38 inhibitor) [54] . Taken together, the regulation of the NRF2/HO-1 and MAPK pathways has been determined to suppress ROS production, which leads to the reduction of the oxidative stress response. Although the inhibitory activities of EPS were not observed in a dose-dependent manner, phosphorylation of JNK, ERK, and p38 was decreased by EPS ( Figure 6A) . Consistently, the expression of iNOS has reportedly decreased at the protein level ( Figure 4B,C) . Interestingly, even though p38 was phosphorylated by EPS itself, EPS did not significantly affect the expression of iNOS ( Figure 4B ,C and Figure 6A) . Although the NO level was not quantified and it was not determined how iNOS and the MAPK pathway regulated each other, it appears indisputable that EPS retains the ability to reduce oxidative stress. Therefore, EPS could be a potential substance to manage ROS levels, and, consequently, prevent and treat the diseases caused by oxidative stress.",

            "text": "TLR4 has been applied as a target for immunopharmacological control of infection from pathogenic bacteria and even viruses [55] . Especially, viral infection can lead to a cytokine storm, which develops via overexpressed proinflammatory mediators, making the immune cells unable to prevent cytokine production [56] . A recent study has confirmed that the coronavirus causing COVID-19 stimulates a TLR4-mediated inflammatory response similar to the pathogenic process of bacterial sepsis [57] . Furthermore, it has been reported that the innate immune response during Ebola virus infection begins when the viral glycoprotein binds to TLR4; subsequently, NF-\u03baB and MAPK signaling pathways are activated [58] . Shirey et al. confirmed the possibility for TLR4 antagonists (e.g., eritoran) to be used as novel therapeutics for the influenza virus-induced cytokine storm [59] . Liu Shen Wan, a known traditional medicine of China, even inhibited the proliferation of the virus as well as expression of cytokines by suppressing TLR4 [60] . Interestingly, our results have shown that EPS itself downregulated TLR4 and MyD88 compared with the control group ( Figure 7B ); this suggests that it can act as an inhibitor of TLR4. Thus, EPS could be used to prevent and treat the diseases caused by uncontrolled inflammatory response associated with virus infections. It has also been shown that TLR4 is involved in the maintenance of host homeostasis [61] . Knockdown of TLR4 ameliorates insulin resistances and glucose tolerance, suggesting that TLR4 is a key therapeutic target for metabolic disorders [62] . Withaferin A decreases the gene expression of TLR4 and COX-2, which protects high-fat diet-induced mice against metabolic disorders such as glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and oxidative stress [63] . Expression of COX-2 in the EPS treatment group was more downregulated than that of the control group by suppressing TLR4, regardless of the presence of LPS ( Figure 7B ). It has already been reported that curcumin, known as a TLR4 inhibitor, can be a candidate for the treatment of metabolic syndrome and type II diabetes mellitus through a clinical trial test [64] . Therefore, EPS could potentially be used to treat metabolic diseases as well as diseases resulting from bacterial and viral infections. However, it is essential to confirm the effect EPS has on normal cells and whether EPS can exhibit anti-inflammatory effect in vivo.",

MyD88 and TRIF phosphorylate members of the MAPK pathway, and the MAPK family protein translocates transcription factors related to the inflammatory response into the nucleus.

Denatured proteins were isolated from media by centrifugation at 10,000\u00d7 g for 20 min, followed by mixing with absolute ethanol. The separated precipitates were dialyzed with the distilled water (DW) at 4 \u00b0C for 24~48 h to fully remove the components of media and other substances. The dialyzed solution was then lyophilized to obtain EPS, which was resuspended in DW for subsequent experiments and stored \u221280 \u00b0C. ",

MyD88 and TRIF phosphorylate members of the MAPK pathway, and the MAPK family protein translocates transcription factors related to the inflammatory response into the nucleus. These translocated factors upregulate the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and COX-2. However, EPS could inhibit the LPS-induced inflammatory response by downregulating TLR4.
