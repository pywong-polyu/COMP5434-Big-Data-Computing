Yet emergency situations as exemplified by a pandemic are likely to give rise to extreme forms of anxiety and, consequently, confusion, as societies and governments struggle to figure out how to effectively cope with the new danger. In such an emotional state, approximating paranoia, the mind (or the psyche) reaches backward into its buried underground, the unconscious, for long forgotten or never till now materialized representations to try and make sense of what is going on. In the Project, Freud (1895) referred to this type of thinking as \"practical thought\" (p. 378) aiming at \"identity\" (ibid.) as a \"primary thought-defence\" (p. 382), its ultimate objective to release unpleasure. Unlike critical thought that makes active use of remembering, practical thought operates by association -not unlike the free association that we invite our patients to exercise when lying on the couch, only in the absence of both the analytical setting and the analyst's mind, such mode of thinking follows the pathway of acting out and agitation as a means of releasing anxiety. We all can remember the initial calls of several European leaders at the beginning of the pandemic that \"we are at war.\"",

Fortunately, this was a transitory phase, in turn confirming what we know from psychoanalytic theory about the fragility of our mature mental state, constantly in oscillation between the paranoid-schizoid and depressive positions as argued by Wilfred Bion using Melanie Klein's theory of mental development. In the present article, I propose to critically examine some of the measures installed to fight the pandemic, such as the face mask, and the responses these have called forth. I rely, in part, on clinical material, in part, on popular culture. My purpose is twofold. First, I wish to exemplify the unique contribution of psychoanalysis for decoding both the political narrative and its reception. Second, I am interested in informing the debate in the political sciences as to what represents good crisis management.

In parallel, public health institutions were expected to activate their contact tracing and testing procedures that are part and parcel of the standard approach for dealing with infectious diseases. What turned out to be a huge challenge-elusive for several governments-was the speed of contamination in conjunction with the structural unpreparedness of public health institutions. As a result, regular full or partial lockdowns became the only available methods to manage the pandemic, also with a view to gaining time to set up or upgrade necessary infrastructures and human resources. Citizens and enterprises were compelled to collaborate by decree, besides being offered a combination of reward and punishment measures, the narrative embedded in moralist argument. However, to the extent that the formulas for launching lockdowns or relaxing restrictions were not transparent, nor always commensurate, there has been an upsurge of critique, especially since Autumn 2020, and a growing sense that governments have failed in their risk management strategies-conceptually as well as in terms of implementation.",

It is, on the contrary, more severe. 2 During psychological development, the unconscious sense of guilt gradually gives rise to a more mature conscience-in Kleinian terms, as we move from the paranoid-schizoid to the depressive position.

But as we know from the psychoanalytic setting with the couch, where the patient is deprived from this form of communication, the face-to-face interaction also serves as a means of controlling the object and forms part of the mechanism of projective identification. People less capable of communicating their emotions verbally or of judging others' emotions from their verbal and acoustic utterances are more likely to feel deprived from this source of information than those with scanning systems that are versatile and not subject to repression.

Such theories provide a narrative for containing the anxiety that emerges in connection with the coronavirus and the measures introduced to deal with it. In this connection, it is important to be cognizant of the fact that it is not the coronavirus alone but the virus in the context of the measures that drive conspiracy theories. This is a point that frequently goes missing in contemporary social and political discussions. Conspiracy theories have accompanied politics throughout history, and especially at times of social upheaval and weakened political institutions. Their real target is the state, or specific state institutions, that are judged unable to control risks, real or imagined, or worse, seen as propagating them. Conspiracy theories are also more likely to emerge when political institutions themselves make extended use of manipulative communication techniques to advance their agendas. In political jargon, this is today known as \"spinning\", the term signifying how political communication has been gradually transformed into political marketing. In former times it was more commonplace to talk about propaganda. 3",

One regularly hears how while working in a home office there is less or no need to dress up-it suffices to be in jeans or a track suit-and many people welcome this as a positive aspect of the lockdown measures. Not all are of this opinion, however. Many miss the opportunity to dress and make up. For some patients still coming to therapy in person, the introduction of the face mask in the winter months, appeared to have a similar effect and was accompanied by a depressive or irritated mood swing.

            "text": "Psychoanalytic theory, especially Freud's ideas on sexual symbolism, have informed fashion studies quite extensively. Less interest has gone into the role of dress in everyday life as well as in the context of the clinical setting, despite the rich anecdotal evidence on this. We all have had the experience at some point or another in the context of a clinical presentation of hearing ourselves or someone else ask what or how the patient looks, or how they dress, while out of the ordinary impressions mediated by colorful or shrill dress, remarkable hairdos, or being unkempt often make it into clinical reports notwithstanding the caution exercised by most analysts if and when advancing such statements considering the subjective but also cultural capital dimensions of taste and related impressions (cf. Bourdieu & Passeron, 2000 [1970 ). What often is only remarked in silence-and rarely spoken about in publications-is how some patients demonstratively dress up-or indeed the opposite, that is, demonstratively underdress-when attending their analytic sessions. Such patients are likely to be unconsciously using dress (and make up) to relate to their objects. Seductiveness or rather the wish to seduce, lends itself as a useful explanation for this type of behavior, especially from a Freudian perspective, but Klein's interpretation of dress, also lending instruction for Joan Riviere's (1929) work on masquerade in connection with femininity, provides an alternative explanation. The two approaches are not contradictory but complementary. Writing about young women, Klein (1932, p. 191 ) notes how they experience \"the adornment of her person and home\" in phantasy as an act of reparation vis-\u00e0-vis their own body and the body of their mother at the same time. It is a behavior aiming to modify their sense of guilt for attacking the mother, again in phantasy, or wishing her dead, as well as their own persecutory anxiety linked to the unconscious conviction that the mother (or the analyst) will retaliate and attack them back. From this perspective, the seductiveness or allure of hysteric (wo)men is less symptomatic of their interest in the (fe/male) object but rather a protective armor, shielding them in phantasy from the object's attacks.",

Sascha Baron, the British comedian and filmmaker known for his sexualized, vulgar, and politically critical films, recently launched a poster to advertise his new movie Borat 2 showing himself wearing a mask in the form of a bikini, that is, to say a mask bikini covering his penis. This poster is one of the few media outputs to have been explicit about the coronarelated health risks linked to sexual intercourse. While Covid-19 is not a sexually transmitted disease, sexual intercourse does represent a risk due to the impossibility, when engaging in it, to uphold physical distancing. Prostitution as well as online dating are therefore directly impacted by the restrictions related to the pandemic and explain one widespread phenomenon during this time, namely what I call monogamous dating: many single people have during the pandemic sought out so-called corona partners to share house and bed during the lockdowns and maybe for longer. 6 It would even seem that individuals, who otherwise have been quite inhibited with respect to either dating or going steady with someone, have apprehended in the lockdown measures a possibility to overcome their resistances and make a new start. 7 Whether these relationships can be sustained in the long-term, that is, under normal conditions, remains to be seen.",

It is an interesting omission considering how our societies pride themselves with respect to sex education, enlightenment, and liberal values. I am here referring to Western societies especially, where also the opposition to the face mask has been greatest. In this light, such opposition could be understood as fueled by the unwillingness to comply with restrictions imposed on sexuality, and, especially, sexual promiscuity. But I think another aspect is even more telling, namely the conspicuous avoidance to address this issue explicitly while at the same time showing little shame and no inhibitions when otherwise intruding into peoples' private lives, including into such vital domains like the play of children, providing emotional support to the elderly living in care homes, going to Church, or attending funerals. I am not suggesting here that the state should prescribe to people how to live their sexual lives; but pointing to the fact that the only domain that has survived the state's inroad into privacy during this pandemic, at least at the level of narrative, has been sexuality. This is not necessarily proof for the sexual liberation of modern societies. I think the opposite is the case, and modern individuals remain sexually inhibited and perhaps even prudish despite the extreme sexualization of Western culture. This may explain the severity of the narrative accompanying the restrictions otherwise. In other words, because inhibitions surrounding sexuality prevail, we resort to a severe super-ego when related anxieties are actualized (as in a pandemic), but insofar as this ambivalence is unconscious, the object of wrath of the super-ego is displaced at the moral level (cf. Freud, 1908 Freud, , 1924 . Thus, sexual curiosity is gratified and at the same time repressed.",

The vaccination plans announced at this stage foresaw a near-total population vaccination by the middle or the end of 2021, whereby most countries did not go as far as enforcing compulsory vaccination. This is in part due to the anticipated production bottlenecks, but it also reflects the concern that a compulsory vaccination program would aggravate the already-existing negative mindset regarding vaccines that currently prevails in many countries despite the role of vaccines over the last two centuries for fighting infectious diseases in children and in adults, thus increasing life expectancy. In an article for Encyclopaedia Britannica, Emily Brunson writes that this mindset has two origins: first, claims that vaccines are responsible for certain conditions such as autism or inflammatory bowel disease as a result of a mercury-containing compound used as preservative in some vaccines-\"those claims have been discredited\", she adds-and second, that \"most individuals in countries where vaccination is widespread have never personally experienced vaccine-preventable disease \u2026 the focus of concern [shifting] from the negative effects of vaccine-preventable disease to the possible negative effects of the vaccines themselves\". 8 I would add that the sense of complacency exhibited by many governments in this field, resulting in less attention paid to durable and targeted raising-awareness measures, has aggravated these concerns, facilitating their spread to larger segments of the population.",

First, there is an egosyntonic supposedly rational fear concentrating on the little time available for testing the vaccines. This goes together with a certain unwillingness to understand the particulars of the scientific method. This fear exists sideby-side with a more instinctive aversive reaction toward presumed greedy-for-profit pharmaceutical companies. At the more concrete level, frequently occurring mostly harmless side-effects are feared equally as rarely occurring serious outcomes.",

Trying to make sense out of such fictional constructs is unlikely to be effective; likewise trying to speak sense into those cathecting such constructions with the power of belief. In psychoanalysis, we are often confronted with such constructions and know how long it takes to decode them, even longer to undo them. Yet, as we also know from psychoanalysis, it is sometimes useful to speak to the underlying emotions of fear and, especially, mistrust. As already noted at the beginning of this short article, the pandemic state of mind is characterized by paranoid anxiety and the supremacy in phantasy of a primitive and harsh superego. To the extent that institutions in charge of implementing strategies to fight the pandemic come to resemble this harsh superego by making use of narratives that incite and feed paranoid anxieties, we may anticipate declining compliance with measures, especially over time as fatigue sets in, undermining natural risk aversion behavior. Against this background, even seemingly innocent catchphrases like \"it is not a political statement\" are counterproductive. The (conscious) objective of this specific motto has been to encourage individuals across political divides to wear a face mask and to underline the importance of national unity and collaboration in times of crisis. After all, it is claimed, the virus does not differentiate between Republicans and Democrats, left and right, black and white, heterosexuals and homosexuals, old and young, or rich and poor. Leaving aside that this latter statement is not true-the virus does affect some individuals and some groups more than others for a variety of reasons-once a certain object has assumed either a political or a psychological meaning and comes to stand for something, this linkage will not disappear by invocation.",

In this context, the borderline between risk communication and fear mongering quickly becomes blurred and communication ends up aggravating rather than containing the paranoid anxieties the pandemic gives rise to.

The role of politics is to contain and manage these anxieties, not to mirror them either by way of hyperbole recognition or by way of denial-two sides of the same coin. Central to a risk management strategy is maintaining a working environment of containment and cooperation across different institutional levels, internationally, regionally, as well as between social and political institutions and between science, media, and society. Only this paves the way for overcoming the real hardships of this crisis as well as for mourning for that and those lost. The role of political communication is to impart complex information and avoid oversimplifications. By implication, this means refraining from treating individuals and groups as a public to be alarmed, pacified, or entertained. Instead, they must be acknowledged as a collective of citizens that are inclined and able to receive and process knowledge, despite being at the same time or for a period of time prone to madness.",

There are two origins for the unconscious sense of guilt: \"one arising from fear of an authority, and the other, later on, arising from fear of the super-ego. The first insists upon a renunciation of instinctual satisfactions; the second, as well as doing this, presses for punishment\" (Freud, 1930, p. 128) . This sense of guilt leads to a feeling of remorse that exists regardless of whether a deed has been committed or just thought about: \"Whether one has killed one's father or has abstained from doing so is not really the decisive thing. One is bound to feel guilty in either case, for the sense of guilt is an expression of the conflict due to ambivalence, of the eternal struggle between Eros and the instinct of destruction, or Death.\" (p. 132). The description matches the pandemic state of mind quite well. 3 As such, it was criticized already in the 1940's by George Orwell (Nineteen Eighty-Four: A Novel, 1949) and in the 1960's by Herbert Marcuse (One Dimensional Man, 1964) . A more recent fictional commentary on conspiracy theories is Umberto Eco's book, The Prague Cemetery (2011). This brilliantly captures the toxic dynamics between the political and the social that underpins the emergence and diffusion of conspiracy theories. The book's main character Simone Simonini makes his living by forgery, spying, and the production of false documents-today we would say fake news. This he does for all political governments of his time: the Italian, the French, the Prussians, and the Russians. Umberto Eco's character has never existed as a real person; the subject matter of Eco's book rather is to show how the fabrications weaved into ideological movements in the 19th century, leading onto the atrocities of the twentieth, were interconnected and often made use of similar sources or narratives. 4 See https://harpers.org/archive/1964/11/the-paranoid-style-in-american-politics/, last accessed December 30, 2020. 5 The feature by Fintan O'Toole also refers to Trump's germaphobia, something he himself talked about in his first press conference as president-elect in 2017. See https://www.nybooks.com/articles/2020/05/14/vector-in-chief/, last accessed 10 April 2021. 6 The Austrian Chancellor, a young man himself, explicitly encouraged this at the onset of the Winter lockdown, albeit without mentioning online platforms explicitly. 7 An interesting clinical case on this has been explored by Jane Milton in her paper \"Love, persecution and reparation during the pandemic\" presented at the UCL Conference \"Contagion, Containment and Staying Connected: A Virtual Conference,\" 27-29 November 2020, https://www.ucl.ac.uk/psychoanalysis/events/2020/nov/contagion-containmentand-staying-connected 8 https://www.britannica.com/science/vaccine/Benefits-of-vaccination#ref324475 (last accessed 19 January 2021).",
