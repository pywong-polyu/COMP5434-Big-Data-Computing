This has led to an almost immediate switch to distance learning by higher education institutions. Anatomy faces some unique challenges. Intrinsically, anatomy is a three-dimensional subject that requires a sound understanding of the relationships between structures, often achieved by the study of human cadaveric material, models, and virtual resources. This study sought to identify the approaches taken in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland to deliver anatomical education through online means. Data were collected from 14 different universities in the United Kingdom and Republic of Ireland and compared adopting a thematic analysis approach. Once themes were generated, they were collectively brought together using a strength, weakness, opportunity, threat (SWOT) analysis. Key themes included the opportunity to develop new online resources and the chance to engage in new academic collaborations. Academics frequently mentioned the challenge that time constrains could place on the quality and effectiveness of these resources; especially as in many cases the aim of these resources was to compensate for a lack of exposure to cadaveric exposure. Comparisons of the actions taken by multiple higher education institutions reveal the ways that academics have tried to balance this demand. Discussions will facilitate decisions being made by higher education institutions regarding adapting the curriculum and assessment methods in anatomy.

One academic stated that that this was an \"opportunity to improve staff awareness of online teaching methods and their confidence in using them.\" For anatomists, this is a unique opportunity to assess the educational benefits of this software, encouraged by free licenses offered by many companies during this time, such as \"Visible Body\" (Argosy Publishing, Inc., Newton, MA) and \"Human Biodigital\" (Biodigital Inc., Seoul, South Korea).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 192, "end": 212, "text": "(Smith et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 357, "end": 371, "text": "(Kreber, 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 613, "end": 647, "text": "(Leppink and van den Heuvel, 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}, {"start": 1110, "end": 1137, "text": "(Skochelak and Stack, 2017;", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1149, "text": "Rose, 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Strengths"}, {"text": "Furthermore, it has triggered the development of new skills in assessment modalities.

Virtual Learning Environments also facilitate randomized presentation of questions, time constraints, and prohibit backtracking in order to prevent collaborative answering. For example, \"Brightspace\" (D2L Corp., Kitchener, Canada) facilitates precise keystroke recording-an important feature to prevent cheating during online spotters. The move to online assessment has identified an opportunity to improve examination conditions (Dennick et al., 2009) . Specifically, this is true for summative continuous assessments that often involve image-based spotter examinations as there is a high workload associated with designing and implementing station-based spotter exams. Schubert et al., (2009) reported that designing, implementing, and invigilating a station-based gross anatomy examination encompassed 3.5 days' work (Shubert et al., 2009). Dennick et al., (2009) showed that student performance on gross anatomical examination is no different between traditional spotter examinations compared to digital online modes.

Creating new resources can take at least three times as much work compared to a traditional format (Gewin, 2020) . This may be attributed to the steep learning curve required to learn how to use technologies effectively. The added pressure of producing \"high-quality resources,\" in addition to fulfilling other academic duties in a limited time period may put undue pressure on academics. Therefore, it is imperative to weigh-up the cost-benefit implications of the time needed to create new resources against the educational benefit for the students.

Cadaveric dissection can be a sensory explosion, arguably one that cannot be stimulated by technology (Korf et al., 2008) .

Many higher education institutions teach through cadaveric dissection and assess the practical element of learnings through a traditional spotter style format. This will encourage students to construct their knowledge of anatomy through learning activities with a focus on cadaveric material.

While there were two responses regarding the negative aspects of working from home, they both reflected the impact of the current Covid-19 crisis (i.e., lack of textbooks and childcare responsibilities). Already, there has been a wealth of support and resources offered by numerous academics on Twitter (TM) (Twitter Inc., San Francisco, CA), Facebook (TM) (Facebook Inc., Menlo Park, CA), and other social media platforms. In addition, the Anatomical Society has a collaborative database containing online resources (AS, 2020).

A frequently expressed concern was diminished student engagement as a function of the rapid implementation of distance learning (36% of responders). On consideration, this may be compounded by the fact that many universities are no longer pursuing typical mandatory attendance policies for teaching sessions. Moreover, the current Covid-19 crisis may cause an increased risk of isolation, anxiety, and boredom among the population (Rubin and Wessely, 2020) . This was also highlighted by one institution as a major concern among the student population where they were worried about the levels of \"anxiety\" that students face on \"the future of their education.\" Previous studies have shown a decrease in quality of life and stress negatively impacts student motivation and academic results (Artino et al., 2010; Lyndon et al., 2017) . Specifically, the responses from this study included comments that highlighted their concerns with \"creating resources that students will actively engage with\" as well as how to \"encourage and maintain student engagement.\" Thus, academics adapting their approach to anatomical education should consider the need for support, interactivity, and social engagement with and between the students. A reduction in these elements may ultimately impede academic progress and student satisfaction. Ultimately, one academic expressed they wanted to ensure that students \"were getting value for money\" from their course. Additionally, technical issues, for example, unstable internet connections or lack of suitable electronic devices, will also impact student engagement (Wimpenny and Savin-Baden, 2013; Ilgaz and G\u00fclbahar, 2015) . The unexpected shift to distance learning means that some students may not be technically prepared for distant learning and assessment. Therefore, due consideration to accessibility must also be considered as a potential threat to delivery of distance learning and assessment. In conjunction with potential issues in relation to the student population, staff may not have proficient knowledge of pedagogical techniques specific to the delivery of online teaching. Some staff members may not have been able to fully evaluate the theoretical and practical implications of distance learning prior to the cessation of face-to-face teaching.

Maintaining the teacherstudent relationship was considered a threat (21% of responders) as online resources lead to a perceived improvement in the online instructor social presence (Draus et al., 2014) . The online instructor presence effectively reduces the transactional distance between student and instructor (Attardi et al., 2018; Stone and Barry, 2019) by increasing the likelihood of interaction. One way to address this issue is to host synchronous (live) classes (McBrien et al., 2009; O'Flaherty and Laws, 2014) . This approach was taken by 36% of universities that hosted live lectures and 43% hosted live tutorials to support practical sessions. Many synchronous software packages contain interactive polls that can be used to assess knowledge, encourage engagement, and provide instant feedback to students. Studies have shown that timely feedback from instructors is hugely important in maintaining engagement (Martin and Bolliger, 2018; Ragusa and Crampton, 2018) . Interactive polling can therefore be utilized in a flipped-classroom approach, shown to increase student interactivity as all levels of Bloom's taxonomy can be assessed if correctly designed (Gilroy et al., 2015) . Providing clear guided instructions for problem solving and linking content to clinical practice and prior knowledge are other methods that are proven to improve engagement (Wimpenny and Savin-Baden, 2013; Boton and Gregory, 2015; Ilgaz and G\u00fclbahar, 2015; Buelow et al., 2018; Martin and Bolliger, 2018) . Thus, within the synchronous classes, staff can potentially utilize anatomical education software programs to incorporate applied anatomy and clinical scenarios into their sessions.
