Data also highlight that, despite the Australian Department of Health recommendation that video consults be used as the primary mode of contact and that telephone should be used only when video consults are not possible [12] , approximately 90% of Australian telehealth consultations in 2020 took place over the telephone [13] . In order to understand the complexity of a rapid transition to telehealth management and how clinicians have approached clinical interactions and decision-making, this study aimed to explore the telehealth experiences of specialists and general practitioners (GP). Such understanding is critical if we are to improve and sustain quality service delivery to patients using telehealth, translating telehealth into a broader system of care with the methods and tools required to support it.",

Two authors (JW, JB), one an occupational therapist and the other a gerontologist, coded data using an inductive thematic approach [18] . At the level of initial coding, both authors read the transcripts multiple times and made notes. Transcripts were then coded line by line, describing and interpreting emerging categories and searching for differences and similarities. Following team discussion, the primary author developed a single codebook, and each code was issued with a four-letter label or code to facilitate data retrieval between the transcripts (for example, symptoms of confidence was labelled \"CONF\"). The next step involved examining the relationship between codes in the context of the research question in order to form themes. Consistency of findings was upheld through discussion of interpretations between researchers to confirm codes and categories. Any differences in researcher perspectives were resolved by negotiation and, if necessary, regrouped and recoded until consensus was reached. New codes were then fed back into the analysis to cross-check codes and themes and develop an overall interpretation of the data [19] . Trustworthiness of our data was achieved using several strategies, including immersion in data, reflexive analysis and peer debriefing [20, 21] . These strategies ensured that the researchers remained open to the data and did not demonstrate bias during the data analysis as a result of preconceptions inherent in the researchers' clinical status and experience [20, 21] . Coders captured exemplary quotes supporting each theme.",

Furthermore, many patients did not come prepared for their telehealth appointment by obtaining essential pathology or scans before a scheduled consult, as they would do in a face-to-face consult.

Evidence shows that up to 55% of the impact of consultation is attributed to visual and nonverbal communication [29] . In addition, evidence shows that patients frequently misunderstand health information given by phone [30] . Poor health literacy is exacerbated in people with mental health issues [31] and sensory conditions such as altered vision and hearing [32] . A key finding of this study was that participants selfinitiated modification of work practice to ameliorate for potential communication deficits, such as more detailed questioning and seeking verification. However, clinicians accepted that clinical care given to patients using telehealth was different, and often delayed, in comparison to care given face to face and that it was difficult to establish a therapeutic relationship. Therapeutic relationships are complex and subjective, requiring patient and therapist collaboration to optimize outcomes, and previous research highlights the need for training [33, 34] . Furthermore, while telehealth competencies exist in the provision of telehealth across various professional groups [35] , few clinicians are formally trained to deliver their professional services using telehealth [36] . Consistent with growing evidence, we posit that the effective use of telehealth requires appropriate education of patients and clinicians about the safe and effective use of telehealth for the provision of high-quality patient-centred healthcare [37] [38] [39] . Previous research has demonstrated that patients are often satisfied with telehealth, the quality of care and convenience [40, 41] . A recent systematic review identified barriers and facilitators to telemedicine [42] , with key barriers including access to and quality of technology, lack of seriousness, difficulty expressing difficult emotions, poor body language, and communication and scheduling conflicts [42] . However, results from our study suggest there was a perceived lack of respect for and preparation before a telehealth consult among patients, which led to unnecessary duplication of consults and delayed assessment. Indeed, previous research suggests that people from rural areas, those with low literacy or low socioeconomic status, or those from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds find telehealth the least accessible and may benefit from education [43] .",

So, I wasted all my time and effort, no decisions could be made on that day\u2026. I am actually quite disappointed that there is not a system of coordination before a telehealth happens. Someone needs to tell them what the expectation of the doctor is.(P15, S)Similarly, many patients \"would not pick up the phone\" (P11, GP) at the scheduled time, which required participants to make multiple calls.

But if they come to me, I can make out very easily this person is getting upset, anxious, then we can really get into the issues that has prevented them from engaging in a proactive healthcare. It may be distress regarding the diagnosis, it may be denial about their condition, so unless we address those aspects properly, you do not actually make a clinical outcome better. (P15, S)",
