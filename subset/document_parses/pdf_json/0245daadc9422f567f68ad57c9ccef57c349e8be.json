Consequently, CQ as an achievable and potential candidate drug to conquer the new coronavirus has been put into action in clinical trials in China. So far, the number of clinical trials with CQ against COVID-19 is fourteen in China, which have never been published before. Naturally, the analog of CQ, hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), shall be gained attention for scientists. Although the price of HCQ is more expensive than CQ, the toxic are lower than CQ (Mackenzie, 1983) .

Quinine remained the mainstay of treating malaria until the 1920s with the obstacle of its poor tolerability, poor compliance with complex dosing regimens and adverse effects with its use (Organization, 1990) . Due to these challenges, CQ, as the most important derivate from quinine, was extensively used, especially beginning in the 1940s (Yakoub AdenAbdi OE et al., 1995) . With extensive use, the adverse reaction of CQ, especially in retinal toxicity and ophthalmologic adverse symptom was obvious (Marmor et al., 2016) . Then HCQ, which aimed to is proved to be threefold less toxic than CQ (Mackenzie, 1983) was designed. Both of the two drugs have a flat aromatic core structure and are weak bases due to the presence of a basic side chain. The basic side chain is thought to contribute to the accumulation of these drugs in intracellular compartments, especially lysosomal compartments, which verifies to be crucial for the potential interaction with nucleic acids (Achan et al., 2011) . The 3D structure of CQ and HCQ is exhibited in Figures  1 and 2 . Neither CQ nor HCQ underwent conventional drug developments, the usage of them were broaden to anti-virus, anti-cancer, anti-rheumatoid arthritis, and so on.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 214, "end": 226, "text": "(Ross, 1918)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 417, "end": 437, "text": "(Organization, 1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 570, "end": 603, "text": "(Yakoub AdenAbdi OE et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF70"}, {"start": 732, "end": 753, "text": "(Marmor et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 826, "end": 843, "text": "(Mackenzie, 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1203, "end": 1223, "text": "(Achan et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1273, "end": 1289, "text": "Figures  1 and 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "RESULTS AND DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "CQ is considered to be an antimalarial drug for so many years, which clinic history could be traced back to 1820 (Chatre et al., 2018) . The 3D structure of CQ is shown in Figure 1 . With French famous pharmacists successfully extracting from cinchona, quinine is the earliest antimalarial for treatment of febrile diseases in the history. In 1930's, German scientists synthesized the CQ with lower toxicity and stronger effect than quinine (White et al., 1983) . The development of CQ against virus was shown in Figure 3 , meanwhile the potential mechanism was exhibited correspondingly in Table 1 . As shown in Table 1 and Figure 3 , the group of Daniel Gonzalez-Dunia used CQ in 1998 (Gonzalez-Dunia et al., 1998 , as a lysosomotropic agent, to inhibit the borna disease virus infection. The mechanism of borna disease virus entry into C6 rat glioma cells were involved in pH-dependent fusion after internalization of the virion by endocytosis, while CQ could prevent endosomal acidification to inhibit the entry of borna disease virus. At the end of 2002, SARS coronavirus was broken out (Casey et al., 2006) . Consequently, CQ was verified effect effectively to inhibit the infection and transmission of SARS-CoV via increasing endosomal pH, as well as interfering with the glycosylation of cellular receptors of SARS-CoV (Vincent et al., 2005) . Also, the similar function was observed in avian leukemia virus (ALV) by CQ (Diaz-Griffero et al., 2002) , which accumulates in endocytic compartments and increases the endosomal pH to reduce the entry of pseudotyped ALV type B. Then in 2006, CQ had been shown to be effective in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV) (Savarino et al., 2006) . With the progress of experimental technology and methodological approaches, the effect of CQ via autophagy inhibition were got extensive attention worldwide (Shi et al., 2017) . The resurgence of Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) in India and the Indian Ocean islands associated with severe clinical symptoms also made great public health concern in 2007 (Lo Presti et al., 2014) . After a series of experiments, the scientists in India suggested the mechanism of CQ to inhibit the CHIKV infection in Vero cells involving the early stages of infection in 2010 (Khan et al., 2010) . And the scientists confirmed that CQ could block the production of proinflammatory cytokines and the proliferation of monocytes, macrophages, and lymphocytes (Paton et al., 2011) . The next year, a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinic trial from Singapore (registration number: NCT01078779) (Di Trani et al., 2007) have verified that CQ did not show protective efficacy against influenza infection (HIN1), although CQ was confirmed viable against both H1N1 and H3N2 influenza strains in vitro (Farias et al., 2013) . Soon afterwards, CQ was test to affect intracellular exocytic pathways by increasing endosomal pH against dengue virus type 2 (DENV-2). The group of Farias KJ verified that 50 mg/ml of CQ could significantly inhibit of DENV-2 load in infected Vero and C6/36 cells production in 2013 (Farias et al., 2013) . The large outbreak of Ebola virus (EBOV) disease in parts of West Africa which was first recognized in March 2014 (Gire et al., 2014) . CQ was honorably repurposed as a potential candidate for treating EBOV. Although it was suggest the replication of EBOV was impaired by CQ in vitro, it might not be affected in vivo, especially in EBOV-infected guinea pig model (Dowall et al., 2015) . CQ can reduce the number of Zika-infected cells in vitro, and inhibits virus production and cell death promoted by Zika infection without cytotoxic effects (Delvecchio et al., 2016) . Then it has been shown in the mice model that CQ can cut off Zika virus from the mother-fetal pathway of vertical infection in 2016 (Delvecchio et al., 2016) . Up to now, CQ was verified effective against COVID-19 in vitro (Carri\u00e8re et al., 2020) via influencing bis (monoacylglycero) phosphate entry through hijacking of the endocytic pathway.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 113, "end": 134, "text": "(Chatre et al., 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 441, "end": 461, "text": "(White et al., 1983)", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 656, "end": 686, "text": "Gonzalez-Dunia used CQ in 1998", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 687, "end": 715, "text": "(Gonzalez-Dunia et al., 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1092, "end": 1112, "text": "(Casey et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1327, "end": 1349, "text": "(Vincent et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 1428, "end": 1456, "text": "(Diaz-Griffero et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1697, "text": "(Savarino et al., 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF57"}, {"start": 1857, "end": 1875, "text": "(Shi et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 2051, "end": 2071, "text": "Presti et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 2252, "end": 2271, "text": "(Khan et al., 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 2432, "end": 2452, "text": "(Paton et al., 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 2580, "end": 2603, "text": "(Di Trani et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2782, "end": 2803, "text": "(Farias et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3089, "end": 3110, "text": "(Farias et al., 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3227, "end": 3246, "text": "(Gire et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 3477, "end": 3498, "text": "(Dowall et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3657, "end": 3682, "text": "(Delvecchio et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3817, "end": 3842, "text": "(Delvecchio et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3908, "end": 3931, "text": "(Carri\u00e8re et al., 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 172, "end": 180, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 513, "end": 521, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 591, "end": 598, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 613, "end": 620, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 625, "end": 633, "text": "Figure 3", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}], "section": "Brief Introduction of CQ on the Virus"}, {"text": "Based on the urgent need of current clinical treatment, on 18 th February 2020, the general office of the national health commission of China published the \"new coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment guideline (the sixth edition)\" to increase CQ into the section of antiviral treatment drugs within this guideline.

Totally, 150 patients have been recruited; in which 148 belong to mild to moderate type of patients with COVID-19 and two were geared to severe type of patients with COVID-19. As the result, the treatment of HCQ did not result in a significantly higher probability of negative conversion than standard of care alone in patients admitted to hospital with mainly persistent mild to moderate COVID-19. To make matters worse, adverse events were higher in HCQ recipients than in non-recipients. The most common adverse event in the HCQ recipients was diarrhoea, reported in 7/70 (10%) patients. Other non-serious adverse events as the authors depicted were vomiting 2/70 (2.86%), kidney injury 1/70 (1.43%), nausea 1/70 (1.43%), abdominal discomfort 1/70 (1.43%), sinus bradycardia 1/70 (1.43%), hypertension 1/70 (1.43%), and so on, which never been found in HCQ nonrecipients. Two HCQ recipients reported serious adverse event, such as disease progression and upper respiratory tract infection. It's worth noting that the usage of HCQ was in combination with antiviral agents (arbidol, virazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, oseltamivir, entecavir) rather than in alone in this trial. Herein, the drug interaction needs to be considering further, while this trial without the relevant design about the relationship between HCQ and antiviral agents.

Retinal toxicity from CQ and HCQ has been recognized for many years (Easterbrook, 1992) . Although HCQ has been demonstrated less side effect compared to CQ via ocular administration, retinal toxicity to HCQ should not to be neglected owing to it might continue to progress even after cessation of therapy. What's more, the increasing risk of visual loss were verified concerning with retinal toxicity (Michaelides et al., 2011) .The retinal toxicity was associated with duration of HCQ use, daily HCQ dosage, and presence of kidney disease (Mititelu et al., 2013) . Proper dosing of maximum 5 mg/kg of HCQ via oral administration was generally accepted (Kim et al., 2017) . As aforementioned, the maximum daily dose should be based on real body weight (Marmor et al., 2011) . The daily dosage of HCQ on lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were at much higher doses (up to 600 mg/d or 800 mg/d) to treat these autoimmune diseases (Al-Rawi et al., 2018) . The clinical trials related with HCQ were a lot, while the therapeutic effect on virus was few. In1997, a randomized, double-masked trial in which HCQ (800 mg/d) or zidovudine (500 mg/d) was given to 72 HIV-l-infected patients for 16 weeks orally in New York (Sperber et al., 1997) . The data have shown that no adverse reactions were observed in either the HCQ or zidovudine group in the study medications with levels of recoverable HIV-l RNA decreasing in both groups. Furthermore, the level of interleukin-6 and serum immunoglobulin G, which related with HIV-l replication in chronically infected cells and might be associated with the development of malignancies and autoimmunity, were significantly decreased in the HCQ treated group but not in the zidovudine group.

This study revealed that RA patients taking with HCQ could decrease coronary artery diseases risk, while the dosage of HCQ was not clearly. A double-blind, randomized, out-patient study (registration number: CTRI/2010/091/006138) in India which was conducted in 328 patients with primary dyslipidemia patients, was demonstrated that HCQ could emerge as a potential drug for combination with statins for treatment of dyslipidemia (Pareek et al., 2015) .
