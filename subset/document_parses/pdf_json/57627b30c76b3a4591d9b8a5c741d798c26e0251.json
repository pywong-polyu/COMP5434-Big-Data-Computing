            "text": "Coronavirus disease , the ongoing global pandemic, is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). Recent evidence shows that the virus utilizes angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a spike protein receptor for entry into target host cells. The bovine ACE2 contains key residues for binding to the spike protein receptor-binding domain. This study evaluated the hypothesis that bovine gonadotroph expresses ACE2, and spike protein suppresses luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) secretion from cultured bovine anterior pituitary (AP) cells. ACE2 mRNA expression and ACE2 protein expression were detected in the bovine AP cells using reverse transcription PCR and western blot analysis. Immunofluorescence microscopy analysis with the anti-ACE2 antibody revealed the co-localization of ACE2 and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor on the gonadotroph plasma membrane. Approximately 90% of GnRH receptor-positive cells expressed ACE2, and approximately 46% of ACE2-positive cells expressed the GnRH receptor. We cultured bovine AP cells for 3.5 days and treated them with increasing concentrations (0, 0.07, 0.7, or 7 pM) of recombinant spike protein having both S1 and S2 regions. The spike protein (0.07-7 pM) suppressed both basal and GnRH-induced LH secretion (P < 0.05). Spike protein (0.7-7 pM) suppressed GnRH-induced (P < 0.05), but not basal FSH secretion. In contrast, pre-treatment with ERK 1/2/5 inhibitor (U0126) partially restored the GnRH-induced LH and FSH secretion from the spike protein suppression. Collectively, the results indicate that gonadotrophs express ACE2, a receptor for coronavirus 2 spike protein, which in turn suppresses LH and FSH secretion from AP cells.",

Recent evidence shows that the virus utilizes angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as a spike protein receptor to enter target host cells [1] ; however, the primary role of ACE2 is to convert angiotensin II to angiotensin-(1-7). Cells expressing ACE2 may thus be a target for the virus. ACE2 is highly expressed in the human testes, ovaries, and other reproductive organs [2] . Indeed, the virus may be an important cause of infertility in men because of its deleterious effects on semen quality and quantity through unclarified mechanisms, as reviewed by Agolli et al. [3] and Moshrefi et al. [4] . However, it remains unclear whether the virus also causes female infertility, especially in domestic animals.",

Gonadotrophs are important cells located in the AP glands, and secrete luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which regulate the testes, ovaries, and, via gonadal steroids, other reproductive organs in animals [7] . However, to the best of our knowledge, the effect of the virus on gonadotrophs remains unclear. Gu et al. [8] reported that human gonadotrophs express ACE2. A recent study clarified that the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 directly activates the cytoplasmic extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway downstream of ACE2 in human platelets [9] . The ERK pathway is also the cytoplasmic pathway downstream of the membrane estradiol receptor (GPR30), that suppresses LH secretion in bovine gonadotrophs [10] . However, the mechanism by which spike protein-activated ACE2 affects LH and FSH secretion by gonadotrophs in all species remains unclear.",

            "text": "Cattle are important domestic animals for food supply worldwide; thus, infertility in cattle is an important issue. Unlike human AP glands, bovine AP glands can be obtained for primary culture as they can be collected from slaughterhouses. Indeed, using bovine gonadotrophs, we discovered new receptors that control LH and FSH secretion, colocalizing with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor (GnRHR) in the lipid rafts of bovine gonadotrophs [7, 11, 12, 13] . Bovine ACE2 contains most of the key residues for the receptor-binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 [14] (details are shown in Supplementary Fig.1) , and SARS-CoV-2 replicates in bovine respiratory tissues [15] . Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that gonadotrophs express the spike protein receptor ACE2, colocalizing with GnRHR on the bovine gonadotroph cell surface, and that the recombinant spike protein suppresses LH and FSH secretion from cultured bovine AP cells. It is also important to clarify the cytoplasmic signaling pathway downstream of ACE2. Therefore, we used an inhibitor to evaluate the contribution of the ERK pathway to the effect of spike protein on gonadotropin secretion from the bovine AP.",

PCR was performed using 20 ng of cDNA and polymerase (Tks Gflex DNA Polymerase, Takara Bio Inc., Shiga, Japan) under the following thermocycling conditions: 94\u00b0C for 1 min for pre-denaturation, followed by 35 cycles of 98\u00b0C for 10 sec, 60\u00b0C for 15 sec, and 68\u00b0C for 30 sec. The PCR products were separated on 1.5% agarose gel using electrophoresis with a molecular marker (Nippon Gene, Tokyo, Japan), stained with Gelstar (Lonza, Allendale, NJ, USA), and observed using a charge-coupled device (CCD) imaging system (GelDoc; Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). The PCR products were purified using a NucleoSpin Extract II kit (Takara Bio Inc.) and then sequenced using PCR primers and the Dye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The sequences obtained were used as query terms to search the homologous sequences using the basic nucleotide local alignment search tool (BLAST) (available on the NCBI website).",

We previously confirmed that pre-treatment with 1,000 nM U0126 alone had no effect on GnRH-induced gonadotropin secretion, but inhibited the ability of estradiol to suppress GnRH-induced gonadotropin secretion from cultured bovine AP cells [10] .",

Similar to other GPCRs [26] , GnRHR forms functionally active homomers and heteromers with different receptors 4 . Fluorescence immunocytochemistry was used to confirm the colocalisation (yellow in the merge panel) of ACE2 and GnRHR on the surface of cultured AP cells (prepared using the Cell Cover method) of post-pubertal heifers. Images were captured using a laser confocal microscope for GnRHR (red), ACE2 (green), DNA (dark blue), and differential interference contrast (DIC) on cultured AP cells which did not receive Triton X-100 treatment for antibody penetration. Thus, the antibody could only bind ACE2 and GnRHR on the surface of gonadotrophs. The arrows indicate the colocalisation of ACE2 with GnRHR. Note that cells prepared using the Cell Cover method are thicker than those prepared using the PFA-Triton method. Scale bars are 10 \u03bcm. [7, 27] . We obtained a strong positive overlap coefficient between ACE2 and GnRHR on the cell surface of bovine gonadotrophs. Therefore, ACE2 may form a heteromer with GnRHR in gonadotrophs. However, the results of this study must be interpreted with some caution. Gu et al. [8] reported ACE2 expression in the human AP gland, but found no significant difference in blood LH and FSH concentrations between and SARS-CoV-2-infected and uninfected patients. However, in another study, male patients with COVID-19 showed lower blood concentrations of testosterone and higher blood concentrations of LH and prolactin [28] . ACE2 is expressed at higher levels in the human testis and ovary than in the AP gland [29] . Therefore, one possible reason is that gonadal ACE2 may bind spike proteins rather than ACE2, and the direct and indirect suppression of steroidogenesis by the virus and immune system, respectively, may then induce hypogonadism, which reduces the negative feedback of steroid hormones to gonadotrophs [30] . Another possible reason could be that the measurements were performed on a one-point sample and not repeated to measure the parameter of pulsatile secretion of LH and FSH.",

            "text": "There are no previous reports of bovine ACE2 protein size using western blotting. As determined by western blotting, the bovine ACE2 protein was approximately 100 kDa. However, this was larger than the 91 kDa predicted from the amino acid sequence. Additionally, human ACE2 shows a band at approximately 100 kDa along with a 50-kDa band [34] . In a previous study [19] , HepG2 cells showed an approximately 100-kDa band using the same anti-ACE2 antibody, but showed a 50-kDa band in this study. This difference in band size may be due to experimental conditions in the culture or sample preparation for western blot. This is because band sizes in western blotting often differ from expected sizes in the case of membrane-bound proteins such as cell-surface receptors, owing to their complex three-dimensional structures, which can include hydrophilic and lipophilic regions that form extracellular, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains [35] .",

Thus, we did not perform RT-qPCR for LH and FSH genes. We previously found that the small interfering RNA method could not be used in this system because secretion was suppressed even in control RNA (unpublished data). Therefore, we evaluated the contribution of ERK pathway using an inhibitor. We could not exclude any other pathway as U0126 partially recovered gonadotropin secretion. In particular, Smad7 pathway suppresses cell function downstream of ACE2 in diabetic nephropathy [36] , and inhibits FSHB gene expression in mouse gonadotrope-derived L\u03b2T2 cells [37] . However, to the best of our knowledge, a SMAD7-specific inhibitor has not yet been developed. Therefore, further studies are required in the future to investigate this aspect.",
