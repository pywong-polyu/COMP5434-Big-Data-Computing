In this investigation, we propose that the degree to which negative emotions mediate the link between system justification and collective action may depend upon whether individuals tend to suppress the expression of their negative emotions. We tested this hypothesis in the diverse socio-political contexts of Turkey, Israel, and the U.S. In one correlational study (Study 1) and three experimental studies (Studies 2-4), we observed that the link between system justification and willingness to participate in collective action through anger (Studies 1-2 and 4) and guilt (Study 3) was moderated by expressive suppression. We found that negative emotions mediated the association between system justification and collective action among those who suppress the expression of their emotions less frequently, but not those who use expressive suppression more frequently. These findings suggest that emotion regulation may undermine, rather than facilitate, efforts to engage in collective action even among people who are low in system justification.",

If system justification influences collective action at least in part by shaping emotions (Osborne et al., 2019) , then the effect of system justification on collective action may depend on whether and how people regulate these emotions in socio-political contexts. To address this hypothesis, we investigated whether suppressing one's emotions toward the status quo undermines social change by weakening the link between system justification and negative emotions. In particular, we propose that people who are dissatisfied with the system but regulate their emotions through expressive suppression would be less likely to express negative emotions such as anger and guilt and would therefore be less supportive of collective action.",

To the extent that people regulate emotions for instrumental reasons (see Tamir, 2016) , those high in system justification may be motivated to regulate their emotions in a way that helps to defend and protect the social system. In this sense, system justification can shape emotional experiences not only by shaping emotional reactions (via appraisals) but by shaping emotion regulation as well. Although system justification may shape emotion regulation, it is not in itself a form of emotion regulation. Justifying the system may lead people to try to change their emotional reactions under certain circumstances, and when it does, it is likely to do so through the implementation of diverse emotion regulation strategies.",

Similarly, a study of teachers who were members of a national union revealed that system justification was negatively associated with anger about the government's position on teachers' pay, and that anger mediated the relationship between system justification and willingness to engage in non-disruptive protest . These studies demonstrate that affective reactions mediate the link between system justification and attitudes and behaviors related to social stability (vs. social change).

Expressive suppression is potentially relevant to collective action because inhibition of the expression of negative emotions is likely to influence both the personal and the social implications of such emotions (Butler et al., 2003; Tackman & Srivastava, 2016) . For instance, a person who hides her anger may avoid acting in a confrontational manner, leading others to become less confrontational as well (Langner et al., 2012) .",

Suppressing emotions either chronically or upon instruction is related to various negative outcomes for the individual and the quality of the relationship (Chernovsky & Hunt, 2017; Gross, 2002) . Suppression, for example, is linked to increased sympathetic responding (Gross & Levenson, 1993) , impaired memory (Richards & Gross, 1999) , and lower levels of social satisfaction and interpersonal closeness (English & John, 2013; Srivastava et al., 2009) .",

Conversely, suppressing negative emotions pertaining to injustice is likely to attenuate the effects of emotion on behavior and to maintain the status quo. For example, women who were led to feel angry and then instructed to suppress their emotional expression were less likely to endorse collective action to change the status quo (Gill & Matheson, 2006) . Our study extends this prior line of work by addressing the possibility that expressive suppression moderates the link between system justification and emotions, thereby weakening support for collective action. From the perspective of system justification, then, by inhibiting the expression of negative emotions expressive suppression is likely to reinforce responses that perpetuate, justify, and bolster existing social arrangements. Expressive suppression may serve to protect ingroup cohesion (Matsumoto et al., 2008) and reduce social conflict (Jack & Dill, 1992) , but it also maintains social power (Langner et al., 2012) , and reinforces intergroup inequality (Jack, 2011) .",

The general emotion regulation was a strategy that individuals used to regulate their emotions generally and are not necessarily related to a specific topic, issue, or domain (e.g., ERQ-Gross & John, 2003) . Research has indicated a positive correlation between general and domain-specific emotion regulation strategies (e.g., Hughes & Gullone, 2011) . We assessed expressive suppression in the socio-political domain rather than administering more general measures (see Aldao & Tull, 2015 for contextual approach to emotion regulation; see also Buri\u0107, Sori\u0107, Penezi\u0107, 2016 , for domainspecific measures of emotion regulation in educational settings). In four studies, then, we measured the use of expressive suppression (Studies 1-3) and manipulated expressive suppression (Study 4) in the context of the socio-political system. We followed the recommendation that individual difference variables should be measured at a specificity level that matches the specificity of the predicted variables (Leary & Hoyle, 2009 ).",

Following this rationale, in Study 3, we manipulated system justification by exposing participants to a system-threatening passage, and then in the experimental (vs. control) condition, we provided them with an opportunity to restore their belief in the status quo by affirming the existing system.

A post-hoc power analysis for the moderation model with three pedictors (multiple regression conducted using G*Power software (Faul et al., 2009 ) yielded sufficient power (Cohen's f 2 effect size = 0.16; R 2 = 0.14; 1-\u03b2 = 0.92). We observed that the system affirmation manipulation significantly decreased anger (b = -0.90, SE = 0.38, t = -2.38, p = 0.020; 95% CI [-1.65, -0.15]), but this main effect was qualified by a significant interaction (b = 0.55, SE = 0.26, t = 2.07, p = 0.041; 95% CI [0.02, 1.07]). The interaction effect size (\u0394R 2 = 0.04) was 0.04 (Cohen's f 2 ), indicating a small-sized effect. As shown in Fig. 3 , for participants who suppressed emotions less frequently, those who were induced to affirm the system reported less systembased anger compared to those who were assigned to the control condition (b = -1.68, SE = 0.53, t = -3.16, p = 0.002; 95% CI [-2.74, -0.62] ). On the other hand, for participants who suppressed emotions more frequently, system affirmation had no effect on anger (b = -0.11, SE = 0.54, t = -0.20, p = 0.84; 95% CI [-1.18, 0.96]). We proceeded to test a moderated mediation model in which anger mediated the relationship between the manipulation of system affirmation and collective action as a function of expressive suppression using Hayes's (2016) PRO-CESS bootstrapping command with 5000 iterations (Model 7). The moderated mediation model was significant (index of moderated mediation = 0.15, SE = 0.10, 95% CI [0.003, 0.41]; see Fig. 4 ). In line with our hypothesis, for participants who used expressive suppression less frequently, system affirmation decreased anger, which in turn, influenced willingness to engage in collective action (b = -0.46, SE = 0.24, 95% CI[-1.08, -0.11]). For those who used expressive suppression more frequently, anger did not mediate the effect of system affirmation on collective action (b = -0.03, SE = 0.15, 95% CI [-0.36, 0.26] ).",

Collective guilt often plays a constructive role in intergroup conflict (Halperin, 2016) , because it can mobilize people to protest against illegitimate actions taken in the past with the goal of repairing damaged intergroup relations (Mallett et al., 2008) .

To explore the generalizability of our approach, we used a different manipulation of system justification mindset than the one used in Study 2. The manipulation in Study 3 was based on the idea that choice restriction increases the tendency to engage in system justification processes. Previous studies have shown that when organizations implement policies that restrict their employees' freedom, people often justify the restrictive policies and react favorably to them, as long as there is no alternative to them (Kay et al., 2009; Laurin et al., 2013) . For example, when people face an inescapable (vs. escapable) condition-such as prohibitions on leaving the country-they are more likely to legitimize the current status quo (Laurin et al., 2010) . The idea that restricted choice increases justification of the status quo is also consistent with another line of research, which suggests that people are less likely to blame others for engaging in harmful activities when they believe that their choices were constrained (vs. unconstrained; Alicke, 2000; Botti & Iyenger, 2004; Botti & Macgill, 2006; Malle et al., 2014) .",

If members of the ingroup are seen as choosing to transgress against outgroup members, this can intensify blame and dissatisfaction, but the absence of choice might make the transgression seem more legitimate. Framing the ingroup's hostility toward the outgroup as not freely chosen, on the other hand, may render these actions more legitimate. Therefore, we expected that framing Israeli military policies regarding Palestinians as necessary (i.e., there is \"no choice\") would increase system justification, compared to framing the same policies as merely one of several possible options (\"high choice\"). Based on this expectation, we manipulated system justification by varying whether or not the Israeli military was perceived as having a choice when setting its policies toward Palestinians. We hypothesized that the effect of system justification on collective action through collective guilt would depend on the use of expressive suppression.",

However, the two concepts can be differentiated. Expressive suppression involves inhibiting the overt display of emotions (Gross & Levenson, 1993) , whereas collective action depends upon group identification, perceptions of injustice, and shared behaviors aimed at supporting or challenging the social system (Becker, 2012; Turner-Zwinkels & van Zomeren, 2020) . Thus, expressive suppression targets the expression of emotions, whereas support for collective action focuses on behavior. At the same time, it is true that emotions are clearly capable of motivating collective action (e.g., Van Zomeren et al., 2004) . In any case, we observed in Studies 1-3 that individual differences in expressive suppression and support for collective action were either uncorrelated or weakly correlated with one another (in Study 1). Although this study focused on the role of expressive suppression, we did not manipulate it directly, so it is not possible to address the causal role of expressive suppression in attenuating the association between system justification and negative emotion. Therefore, we manipulated both system justification and expressive suppression (vs. emotion expression) in an experimental design in Study 4.",

They were informed that they would watch a video about the National Security Agency's mass surveillance of U.S. citizens. Participants were then randomly assigned to either an expressive suppression or an emotion expression condition (see Burns et al., 2007; Gross, 1998) . Participants in the expressive suppression condition were instructed not to let their feelings show while watching the video clip. In contrast, participants in the emotion expression condition were instructed to express their feelings freely and openly (see Appendix). Next, participants watched the anger-inducing video clip, which was selected on the basis of a pilot study. Participants were instructed to watch the video once and in full and were then asked to respond to two attention check items about the content of the video. 11 After watching the video, participants completed two items to check on the manipulation of expressive suppression (\"I hid my emotions during the video\", and \"During the video, I tried not to show my feelings\", r = 0.85, p < 0.001) 10 Three attention check questions were used. One question was an instructional attention check (IMCs; Oppenheimer, Meyvis, & Davidenko, 2009) , and two questions were related to the video stimuli contents (e.g., \"What is the name of the institution that is accused of illegal surveillance?\" and \"What is the name of the movement against surveillance that is mentioned at the end of the video?\"). Participants who failed on the instructional attention check question and one of two reading check questions were excluded from the analysis. 11 Using the Prolific platform, we exposed 126 participants (75 females, 51 males, Mage = 38.63, SDage = 13.50, range = 18-80; 31 Republicans, 95 Democrats) to three videos about surveillance in the U.S. and selected the the one that aroused the most anger. First, participants watched each video and rated their emotions in response to the government's surveillance (e.g., anger; rage, unease, fury, frustration, annoyance) on a scale of 1(Not at all) to 9(A great deal). Next, participants answered two questions: \"I approve the government's collection of personal privacy data (e.g., phone calls, internet data) of the Americans\" and \"I think monitoring the private communication of American citizens by the government is unacceptable\" (reverse) (1 = Strongly disagree; 7 = Strongly agree; r = 0.65, p < .001). One sample t-tests were used to compare anger-related emotions with the scale midpoint (5). Results revealed that Democrats scored significantly above the midpoint in terms of anger (M = 5.85, SD = 2.11, t(94) = 3.94, p < .001), but Republicans did not (M = 5.65; SD = 2.82, t(30) = 1.27, p = .213). Democrats also reported lower level of support for mass surveillance (M = 1.71, SD = 1.08) than Republicans (M = 2.40, SD = 1.47), t(41.04) = 2.43, p = .019. and two items checking on the perceived success of emotion expression (\"During the video, I tried to express my feelings openly and freely\", and \"I showed my emotions during the video\", r = . 0.89, p < 0.001). Manipulation check measures were rated on a 9-point Likert type scale (1 = Strongly Disagree; 9 = Strongly agree). For exploratory purposes, participants also completed the general system justification scale at the end of the study.",

A post-hoc power analysis showed that Cohen's f 2 effect size (0.08; R 2 = 0.07) for the moderation model with three pedictors yielded sufficient power (1-\u03b2 = 0.92). In this analysis, system justification was marginally associated with anger in the predicted direction (b = -0.17, SE = 0.09, t = -1.85, p = 0.067; 95% CI [-0.35, 0.01] ), but the association between expressive suppression and anger was not significant (b = -0.41, SE = 0.28, t = -1.49, p = 0.137; 95% CI [-0.96, 0.13] ). The interaction, however, was significant (b = 0.49, SE = 0.18, t = 2.69, p = 0.008; 95% CI [0.13, 0.85]). In the emotional expression condition participants who were lower (vs. higher) in system justification reported more anger (b = -0.42, SE = 0.13, t = -3.24, p = 0.001; 95% CI [-0.68, -0.17] ). In the expressive suppression condition, on the other hand, system justification was unrelated to anger (b = 0.07, SE = 0.13, t = 0.54, p = 0.588; 95% CI [-0.18, 0.32] (see Fig. 7 ). Here, sensitivity power analysis for the interaction term (multiple regression: R 2 increase) using 0.80 as a threshold yielded an effect size of 0.04, indicating that the minimal detectable effect was a small-sized effect. We observed that the interaction effect size (\u0394R 2 = 0.04) was 0.04 (Cohen's f 2 ), reflecting a small-sized effect. Fig. 7 Interaction between scores on the general system justification scale and expressive suppression in Study 4 12 We also conducted 2 (emotion expression vs expressive suppression) \u00d7 2 (low vs high system justification) analyses of variance (ANOVA) on anger.

Likewise, neither tha main effect of expressive suppression (F(1, 190) = 2.50, p = .116, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.01) nor the interaction (F(1, 190) = 0.04, p = .840, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.000) were significant. 13 To determine whether the system justification manipulation affected the measure of system justification, we conducted a 2 (emotion expression vs expressive suppression condition) \u00d7 2 (low vs high system justification condition) analysis of variance (ANOVA).

First, it is possible that the manipulations, both of which were textbased, were too complicated or mentally taxing to work in tandem as we had expected. Second, it might be relevant that the study was conducted during the coronavirus pandemic. Insofar as the pandemic presumably made inequality and system-related problems (with the health care and economic systems) more salient in the U.S., it is possible that the induction of the high system justification mindset was too weak to be sustained throughout the experiment. Third, it is possible that other individual differences, such as political orientation or party identification, might have affected the efficacy of the system justification manipulation in our sample. We did not measure the strength of partisanship in this study. However, we know from previous research that liberals and Democrats tend to score lower than conservatives and Republicans on system justification (e.g., Azevedo et al., 2017) . Thus, it is conceivable that liberals and strongly identified Democrats might have found it difficult to maintain a high system justification mindset, especially during the Trump presidency and coronavirus crisis.",

High system-justifiers tend to express fewer negative emotions such as anger and guilt and are less likely to engage in system-challenging collective action, in comparison with low system-justifiers. At the same time, very few citizens actually participate in collective action , so there must also be non-ideological reasons why even low system-justifiers eschew collective action. Building on theory and research on emotion regulation, we proposed that the link between system justification and collective action should depend upon the ways in which people regulate their emotions. In the four studies reported here, we observed that people who question the societal status quo report more negative emotions and support for system-challenging collective action-unless, that is, they are disposed to engage in expressive suppression of their emotions directed at the social system. Presumably, this is because protesting not only requires experiencing certain emotions but also being willing to express those emotions in public. To the extent that individuals inhibit their emotional expressionsespecially the expression of negative emotions directed at the social system-they are unlikely to participate in collective action aimed at improving the status quo, even if they disapprove of the way things are. In support of this hypothesis, we observed that expressive suppression moderated the effect of system justification on system-based anger and collective guilt, thereby undermining support for system-challenging collective action.

Our work suggests that expressive suppression may have harmful consequences not only for individuals and dyads but also for society as a whole, insofar as it is associated with a reluctance to support social change. Our findings are consistent with a previous demonstration that the inhibition of anger expression in response to discrimination decreased support for collective action (Gill & Matheson, 2006) . They are also highly consistent with a previous demonstration that using the strategy of cognitive reappraisal reduces one's motivation to engage in political action (Ford et al., 2018) . As in this earlier study, we focused on social psychological processes that decrease the likelihood of engaging in protest behavior. Because emotion expression is, historically speaking, necessary for the attainment of freedom and equality, inhibiting emotion expression may hinder the motivation for social change even among those who are most likely to support it.",

Therefore, emotion regulation strategies used in one context may not be appropriate in another context (Hughes & Gullone, 2011) . Our research focused on emotion regulation in specific sociopolitical domains rather than emotion regulation in general (see also Buri\u0107 et al., 2016; Halperin & Gross, 2011; Hughes & Gullone, 2011 for emotion regulation in specific domains). Research on emotion regulation in the socio-political domain focuses on the link between emotion regulation strategies and political attitudes and behaviors (e.g., Gross, Halperin, & Porat, 2013 ; for a review, see Ford & Feinberg, 2020) . Our findings are in line with a multidimensional, context-sensitive approach to the connection between ideological factors and both automatic and deliberative processes of emotion regulation Shnabel & Ullrich, 2016) . According to this approach, considering individuals' ideological contexts when studying emotional reactions can help us distinguish automatic reactions from socio-political ideology-driven deliberative reactions. We showed that expressive suppression implemented in particular socio-political contexts moderates the relationship between emotional processes and socio-political outcomes.",

These results should be interpreted with caution, but it is noteworthy that we obtained fairly consistent support across studies for the role of expressive suppression in moderating the association between system justification and anger. However, it is true that in Study 3 there was a significant indirect effect without a significant direct effect, and in Study 4 the hypothesized interaction between expressive suppression and system justification as a manipulated variable was not significant. Future research would do well to consider other manipulations of system justification and to make use of larger sample sizes that provide greater statistical power. A second limitation of our research program is that we measured self-reported willingness to participate in collective action rather than actual participation. Future studies should determine whether the effects we have observed with respect to behavioral intentions apply to actual behavior as well. A third limitation is that we cannot explain precisely why some low system-justifiers were inclined to use expressive suppression of system-based emotion. One possibility is that they sought to conceal their emotions in an effort to avoid social reproach. From the standpoint of social change, it would be useful to have a better understanding of the psychological mechanisms underlying the use of expressive suppression strategies, especially in the case of low system-justifiers.",

Given that emotions communicate meaningful information to others (Buck, 1984) , it is possible that the suppression of negative emotions toward the social system conveys tacit messages to other members of the ingroup. The suppression of anger or collective guilt, for instance, may signal that authority figures are fair, right, and legitimate, and thus that social change is unnecessary or unjustifiable. It is also conceivable that, in some contexts, expressing system-based anger or collective guilt would be considered to be socially inappropriate and may even elicit social sanctions. By exploring the interplay between expressive suppression and system justification processes, the present investigation points to several new avenues for understanding-and perhaps overcoming-the emotional obstacles to the attainment of social change (see also Jost, 2020) .",

A post-hoc power analysis showed that the manipulation provided 71% power to detect effect size d in independent-samples t-test (two-tailed).Participants also reported lesser collective guilt in the low choice condition (M = 1.89, SD = 1.05) than the high choice condition (M = 2.74, SD = 1.55), t(70) = 2.78, p = 0.007, Cohen's d = 0.64. The manipulation did not affect collective action, t(70) = 0.14, p = 0.888, Cohen's d = 0.04, or expressive suppression, t(70) = 1.11, p = 0.271, Cohen's d = 0.26.To determine whether the effect of system justification on collective guilt was moderated by expressive suppression, we again used Hayes' (2016) PROCESS bootstrapping command with 5,000 iterations (model 1). A post-hoc power analysis showed that Cohen's f 2 effect size (0.16; R 2 = 0.14) for the moderation model with three pedictors yielded sufficient power (1-\u03b2 = 0.80). The low perceived choice manipulation significantly decreased guilt (b = -0.84, SE = 0.31, t = -2.71, p = 0.009; 95% CI[-1.45, -0.22]), and this effect was qualified by a marginally significant interaction (b = 0.46, SE = 0.27, t = 1.74, p = 0.087; 95% CI [-0.07, 0.99]). The interaction effect size (\u0394R 2 = 0.04) was 0.04 (Cohen's f 2 ), indicating the small-sized effect. As shown inFig. 5, for participants who suppressed emotions less frequently, those who were assigned to the low (vs. high) choice condition reported less collective guilt (b = -1.38, SE = 0.44, t = -3.14, p = 0.003; 95% CI[-2.25, -0.50]). For participants who suppressed emotions more frequently, the experimental manipulation did not affect collective guilt (b = -0.29, SE = 0.44, t = -0.67, p = 0.506; 95% CI[-1.17, 0.58]).",
