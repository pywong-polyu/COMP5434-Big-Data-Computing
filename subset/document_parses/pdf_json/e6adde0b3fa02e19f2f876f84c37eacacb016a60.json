            "text": "In the vein of recent empirical literature, we reassessed the impact of weather factors on Covid-19 daily cases and fatalities in a panel of 37 OECD countries between 1st January and 27th July 2020. We considered five different meteorological factors. For the first time, we used a dynamic panel model and considered two different kinds of channels between climate and Covid-19 virus: direct/physical factors related to the survival and durability dynamics of the virus on surfaces and outdoors and indirect/social factors through human behaviour and individual mobility, such as walking or driving outdoors, to capture the impact of weather on social distancing and, thus, on Covid-19 cases and fatalities. Our work revealed that temperature, humidity and solar radiation, which has been clearly under considered in previous studies, significantly reduce the number of Covid-19 cases and fatalities. Indirect effects through human behaviour, i.e., correlations between temperature (or solar radiation) and human mobility, were significantly positive and should be considered to correctly assess the effects of climatic factors. Increasing temperature, humidity or solar radiation effects were positively correlated with increasing mobility effects on Covid-19 cases and fatalities. The net effect from weather on the Covid-19 outbreak will, thus, be the result of the physical/direct negative effect of temperature or solar radiation and the mobility/indirect positive effect due to the interaction between human mobility and those meterological variables. Reducing direct effects of temperature and solar radiation on Covid-19 cases and fatalities, when they were significant, were partly and slightly compensated for positive indirect effects through human mobility. Suitable control policies should be implemented to control mobility and social distancing even when the weather is favourable to reduce the spread of the Covid-19 virus.",

In the Northern Hemisphere, it was widely hoped last winter that the transition to higher temperatures could slow the spread of the pandemic. This sentiment was based on the principle that the flu or influenza incidence a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 increases during winter periods when temperature and humidity levels are likely to be at lower levels but are very moderate during summer [1] . Over the longer term, as more people develop immunity, some researchers suggested that Covid-19 may likely fall into a seasonal pattern like those seen with diseases caused by other coronaviruses. However, pandemic viruses can behave differently, as underlined for pandemic influenza, such as 2009 A/H1N1A or the Spanish flu, at least in the short-run [1] . Nonetheless, some hints from recent lab experiments or statistical studies suggest that increased temperature and humidity may reduce the viability of SARS-CoV-2.",

In line with many other respiratory pathogens showing seasonality, SARS-CoV-2 might be sensitive to environmental factors, especially absolute and relative humidity conditions and temperature [2] showed that human coronaviruses can remain infectious on inanimate surfaces at room temperature for up to 9 days, but the duration of persistence is shorter at a temperature of 30\u02daC or more. A higher temperature, such as 30 or 40\u02daC, reduced the duration of persistence of highly pathogenic MERS-CoV, TGEV, and MHV.",

Finally, these results are in accordance with other previous lab experiments on different viruses, such as the gastroenteritis virus and mouse hepatitis virus [5] , to determine the effects of air temperature and humidity on pathogenic viruses, such as SARS-Cov, and confirm the role of high temperatures (20 and 40\u02daC), as well as the existence of non-monotonic relationships. Other studies [6, 7] showed that cold and dry conditions increase the transmission of the virus.",

A few robust studies [8] [9] [10] concluded that climate may be a marginally significant driver in evaluating the course of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, despite several new empirical investigations, the conclusions of the literature about the climate impact are still mixed (see the differences between the results obtained by [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] and [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] ), and real observations do not validate previous lab projections. The negative effects of high levels of temperature and humidity found in some recent empirical studies [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] seem consistent with studies about the effect of physical factors on the virus and its survival rate conducted in experimental works. Regions with low humidity and average temperatures between 40 and 50\u02daF (4 to 10\u02daC) are likely to increase the spread of the virus [10] ; above 25\u02daF, there is a strong association between temperature and reduced transmission rates, with the largest effect a 30 to 40% reduction, but, in most locations, even 40%, which was only seen for very hot and humid conditions, still left Covid-19 climbing at an exponential rate [13, 14] showed that although cases of COVID-19 are reported all over the world, most outbreaks display a pattern of clustering in relatively cold and dry areas.",

Indirect effects associated with temperature are difficult to evaluate. Indeed, warmer temperatures increase incentives for inhabitants to go outdoors, thus, reducing the transmission rate that is particularly high in closed areas, and low temperatures are incentives for people to stay indoors (low mobility), which is a source of increasing diffusion of the virus. Thus, it may be associated with a negative correlation coefficient. However, warmer temperatures will not systematically reduce virus transmission. In some cases, outdoor activities (in parks, shopping, meetings, etc.) could lead to a reduction of social distancing and, thus, increase the transmission rate of the virus. In addition, in times of very high temperatures, people will prefer to stay at home and use air conditioning that is likely to be bad for air quality and virus spread.

Covid-19 data was aggregated by [29] , DELVE Global COVID-19 Dataset and are available at http://rs-delve.github.io/data\\_\\software/global-dataset.html. Previous academic research commonly used infected cases, fatality rate, or both as endogenous variables. Here, for comparison purposes with previous studies we used both indicators although infected case counts can be biased. Recently, [30] considered missing data on tests for infection issues, as well as imperfect accuracy of tests and showed that the infection rate might be substantially higher or lower than reported; for instance, Illinois, New York, and Italy infection rates are substantially lower than reported. In some countries, during pandemic waves, testing has been stopped due to lack of time concerns. Another reason to consider both infected cases and fatality rates is that these two variables, though related, do not capture the same Covid-19 outcomes (short-run versus long-run dynamics). Infected people are generally officially considered infected (by testing) only a few days (between 7 and 14 days) after the contamination day, although the median incubation is estimated to be 5 days [31] . Thus, infected case counts capture a short-run effect of potential climatic or social distancing variables on the Covid-19 pandemic. However, the delay is longer for death counts considering the time people can develop the disease and stay in hospitals. Therefore, the fatality rate captures a long-run dimension of the transmission from climatic and other determinants (mitigation policies for example) to Covid-19 outcome.",

We considered epidemiological and statistical arguments when we selected these particular starting dates. Considering these time windows enabled us to start our estimates when the first significant number of Covid-19 cases and deaths was observed, as well as to have enough observations in the time dimension to perform a dynamic model. In the robustness tests part, we relaxed this assumption and considered the totality of the available data. An alternative solution would be to build a normalized sample, where time t = 1 is set when a country reports at least 1000 infected people, for instance. Robustness checks showed that the heterogeneity of the starting dates was not a significant issue.",

Maddala Wu and Pesaran CIPS tests were performed and showed that the dynamics of the series were driven by deterministic and stationary stochastic processes.

Thus, y it\u22121 , for instance, is an autoregressive term of order one that accounts for the persistent feature of the pandemic (effect of the previous period on the current situation). C it\u2212p is a vector of variables depicting the effects of meteorological conditions in day t-p. Country-specific fixed effect, \u03bc i , was included to control for time-invariant omitted-variable bias and 2 it is the error term. \u03b4 t is a deterministic time trend (squared trend was also tested) that controls the deterministic dynamics of the epidemics over the studied period and captures some unobserved information about the pandemic common to all countries (changes in human behaviours, or public mitigation policies such as testing or tracking for instance). In addition, lagged terms y it\u2212k capture the stochastic part of the pandemic dynamics. We assumed k was equal to 7 or 14 lags/days in our baseline specifications, considering incubation and confirmation periods presented in the Covid-19 literature. Moreover, for logical reasons, since climatic factors do not immediately impact Covid-19 spread, the climatic variables were also included in our model with a lag of order p. Indeed, there were delays between the time of potential infection corresponding to certain climatic events and the time of official counting of a potentially infected person (or fatality). Therefore, when dealing with p, 7 or 14 days were considered when casepop was used as an endogenous variable, considering the short period between transmission and infection. A 14 day/lag delay was considered a benchmark when dealing with deathpop because of the more important lag length assumed between infection and death related to Covid-19. More lags (28 = one month or 42) were also considered in robustness checks to consider the dynamic persistence of the pandemic. Again, casepop and deathpop give a short-run and medium/long-run time perspective, respectively, of the dramatic outcomes of the pandemic. Notably, when y it is the fatality rate, we also added the ratio of infected cases per capita in our benchmark specification to account for the fact that the level of the pandemic can impact the fatality rate. The reason behind this is to control for a level effect and a kind of saturation effect of the health system (too many infected people to manage is likely to increase the fatality rate).",

In other words, we now estimated the effects of meteorological factors conditionally on mobility dynamics. Eqs 1 and 2 were estimated by several estimators and especially by the mean group (MG) model of Pesaran and Smith [33] and the dynamic fixed effect (DFE) estimator that was relevant for macro panels, such as the one used in this paper, when the time dimension exceeds the cross-section dimension. Indeed, in our sample, the mean of the time dimension noted T is equal to 174 and was, thus, largely superior to the cross section dimension noted N, which is equal to 37. The MG estimator consisted of estimating each regression separately for each panel member i (country here) with a minimum of econometric restrictions. All estimated coefficients were heterogeneous and subsequently averaged across countries via a simple unweighted average. An intercept was included to capture country fixed effects, as well as a linear trend. Considering the minimal number of restrictions of this estimator, a large time-series dimension was needed to respect consistency. A small N (inferior to 20) was also a problem, as it increased the sensitivity to outliers, but we selected 37 OECD countries here. The high dimension of our panel allowed the use of this estimator in this study. In contrast, the Dynamic Fixed Effect estimator (DFE), more similar to the PMG estimator developed by [34] , assumes the slope coefficients to be equal both in the long-and short-run.",

Another identification issue was related to the potential reverse causality bias related to our Covid-19 variables: news about contemporaneous dynamics of the Covid-19 outbreaks and counts can change human behaviour in real time and social distancing.

Mobility can impact Covid-19 transmission rates, as demonstrated by [10] and [36] . Thus, we evaluated both direct and indirect effects via interacted terms by introducing a mobility variable. Direct or physical effects refer to the impact of higher temperatures, humidity, or solar radiation, for instance, on the survival of the virus onto surfaces or as droplets. This decomposition of the effects enabled us to investigate if the climatic factors may impact Covid-19 outcomes conditionally to the level of displacements of the population (here, driving, but our results are robust when walking is used instead). The interaction term solar radiation \ufffd mobility was significantly positive at a high level of confidence concerning infected case specifications (Table 6 ). In other words, during sunshine periods, mobility and climatic effects were positively correlated and tended to reinforce themselves within a seven-day action period. The same results were derived for temperature and humidity but in a less clear manner (only at 10% level for some specifications). In addition, these results were more significant when considering the fatality rate as a dependent variable (Table 7) . This could be explained by the higher relevance of the fatality rate variable in comparison to the infected cases used to capture the true dynamics of pandemics. We found that solar radiation always has a negative direct coefficient as it is expected to physically reduce the resistance of the virus. The interaction terms between solar radiation and mobility, as well as temperature and mobility and humidity and mobility, were positive and show that mobility and climatic variables strengthen each other. Since we focused on climatic variables, we interpreted the positive interaction term as a counterbalancing effect that was probably underestimated in previous studies. The overall (net) effect of meteorological factors was thus composed of a direct negative effect and an indirect positive effect. This net effect was negative in the short-run (at least), but our results showed that the direct physical effect of temperature, humidity, and solar radiation was partly counterbalanced by changes in human behaviour. The potential reduction of climatic factors was indeed partially and slightly compensated for by a significant positive effect stemming from the interaction between climatic variables, namely temperature, humidity, and solar radiation, and the mobility variable on Covid-19 infected cases ratio and fatality rates.",

We interpreted this direct effect as a lockdown effect in the short-run. Indeed, most countries in our sample implemented a lockdown policy; in the short-run, the effect of this policy was influenced by reverse causal endogeneity issues, where people were asked to reduce their mobility (driving or walking, for instance) due to the strong diffusion of the virus. For robustness check purpose, we accounted for the effect of the lockdown policies, see the estimates displayed in the Tables H1, H2 in S1 Appendix, the lockdown is proxied by a dummy variable (Dummy_lockdown) and in Tables H3, H4 in S1 Appendix by a continuous variable computing the time between the starting time of the lockdown and the current period (Time_lockdown). An increased number of cases was, thus, associated with reduced mobility. We controlled this potential endogeneity issue, and our tests revealed that when the number of lags increased (Tables D1-D4 in S1 Appendix), the sign of the mobility variable changes to be positive in the infected cases' regression. In the long-run, increasing mobility was likely to increase transmission rates and create new clusters. In other words, increasing individual mobility was a factor of virus spread when more people were more mobile. Social distancing was likely to be reduced and the transmission rate to increase. Consequently, in the long-run, increasing mobility would increase the fatality rate of the virus, confirming that lockdown policies have probably been relevant to try to reduce the severity of the pandemic by reducing mobility.",

In addition, more lags allowed better consideration of count biases, as we previously discussed. For instance, count delay has sometimes been estimated to be 10 days (between real infection and official recording in some countries).

A well understanding of the role of climatic factors on Covid-19 implies to go beyond simple static correlations and regressions. Finally, it was crucial to consider the short and long-run dynamics of the epidemic, and the choice of different Covid-19 outcomes as endogenous variables was not neutral.",

Thus, climatic factors (especially temperature and solar radiation) had a negative direct coefficient, meaning that they are associated with a significant decrease in the number of infected cases and in the fatality rate.

The net effect from climate on Covid-19 outbreaks will, thus, result from some potential direct negative effects of climatic variables and from indirect effects through changes in human behaviour in relation to climatic conditions.

This simply means that climate had a marginal direct effect, significant, via physical channels, but it can be compensated for by human behaviour. Indeed, climate can influence other crucial determinants, such as social distancing, wearing masks through mobility, and human behaviour. In this perspective, meteorological factors are drivers of the mobility of many people. On the one hand, high temperatures and sunshine lead people to move away and not stay in clustering places that reduce the transmission rate by introducing more distance between people since it is now well known that the virus is essentially transmitted through droplets generated via coughing and sneezing and to a lesser extent through the air, when tiny particles, or aerosols, hang around. A minimum one-meter distance is requested, but a four-meter distance has also been suggested very recently [38] . Climatic factors can, thus, reduce the spread of the virus through this indirect channel. On the other hand, when climate conditions are favourable and people are spending time outdoors, they can go to parks, in meetings, and on terraces; this can sometimes lead to careless behaviour when people reduce social distancing or do not wear masks when it is necessary. In addition, when temperatures are very high, people are likely to stay indoors with air conditioning, leading to an increase in the Covid-19 transmission rate.",
