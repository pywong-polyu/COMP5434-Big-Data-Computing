            "text": "COVID-19 has impacted the lives of people around the world. During times of uncertainty, it is crucial to focus on mental and emotional well-being to navigate these difficult circumstances in a healthy way. In the absence of a vaccine, public health measures have been implemented to prevent and reduce the spread of the virus. Schools have been closed, and most extracurricular activities for children and adolescents that typically occur outside the home and in group settings have been cancelled. Children and adolescents are experiencing a prolonged state of physical isolation from their peers, teachers, extended family, and community networks. Social distancing and school closures therefore increase the mental health problems of children and adolescents, who are already at higher risk for developing mental health problems compared to adults at a time when they are also experiencing anxiety over a health threat and threats to family employment/income. School routines are essential coping mechanisms for young people with mental health issues. During school closures, children lose an anchor in life, and their symptoms can return. For children and adolescents with mental health issues, school closures mean a lack of access to the resources that they usually have through schools [1] . In a survey that the mental health charity Young Minds conducted, over 2000 children and adolescents in the UK verbalized that the pandemic has made their mental health conditions worse and that they are unable to access mental health support. Peer support groups, face-to-face services, and telephone support services can be challenging for some children [2] .",

Different studies have shown that crisis events negatively impact the psychological well-being of children and adolescents [4] [5] [6] . A recent study that Jiao et al. (2020) conducted in China screened children and adolescents for behavioral and emotional distress due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Anxiety, depression, distraction, irritability, and the fear that family members would contract the deadly disease were the most common problems that they identified [7] . Moreover, when adolescents struggle with emotional problems, they often turn to drug use to help them to manage painful or difficult feelings [3] . The mechanisms that they use to cope with stressful situations is not distinct from those of adults; however, because children's and adolescents' brains are still developing, the consequences of \"self-medication\" are more instantaneously challenging [8, 9] . In the short term, substance use can help to relieve undesirable mental health symptoms such as hopelessness, anxiety, irritability, and negative thoughts. However, in the longer term, it aggravates them and often ends in abuse or dependence.",

Children and adolescents reported high levels of stress, which can affect their brain development, sometimes with irreparable long-term consequences [10] . As a result, many organizations have developed online tools and targeted interventions to improve the mental health of young children during COVID-19. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) [11] has developed a tool called \"Helping Children Cope With Stress During the 2019-nCoV Outbreak\". Similarly, many organizations around the globe have initiated telephone and text-messaging services to support children with mental health issues and those who are undergoing crises such as substance abuse during the pandemic (Takeuchi, 2020). However, many questions remain: Which interventions work? How are they designed, implemented, and evaluated? Are these interventions sustainable and potentially scalable?",

As the pandemic continues, it is important to monitor the impact on children's and adolescents' mental health and status and improve their mental health outcomes in the current and future pandemics. A rapid systematic review was conducted to provide timely evidence synthesis to inform urgent healthcare policy decision-making. A rapid review adheres to the essential principles of systematic reviews, including scientific rigor, transparency, and reproducibility [12, 13] . The aim of this rapid systematic review study was to identify and evaluate (a) the impact of the pandemic/epidemic on children's and adolescents' mental health, (b) the effectiveness of different interventions employed during the current and previous pandemics to promote children's and adolescents' mental health, and (c) to identify knowledge gaps in these contexts. This rapid review aims to advise public health and policy makers on strategies and interventions to improve mental health among children and adolescents in pandemics.",

We divided the studies that involved mixed methods into two components: qualitative and quantitative [21] . The qualitative researchers discussed their data collection and analysis method; however, the results were not transparent [17, 22] . In contrast, intervention studies reported the representativeness of the data confounders, type of interventions, and outcomes [18, 35] . On the whole, the mixed-method studies did not discuss in depth their interpretation of the data and failed to identify discrepancies [21] . The cross-sectional studies included some in which the researchers did not explicitly identify their inclusion and exclusion criteria [22, 23] . Buzzi et al. (2020) did not test the reliability and validity of their instruments, and some researchers did not take into consideration other variables, inclusive of the confounders [26, 31, 32, 34] . The included studies also demonstrated selection bias [29, 31] and gender and demographic bias, which limited the generalizability of the findings [20] . In the interventional studies, the number of people who dropped out of research was fairly high, and required information on the compliance with the intervention was missing [17, 19] . ",

The majority of the researchers of the studies (n = 13) administered cross-sectional online surveys to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on children's and adolescents' mental health. In their cross-sectional survey, Taylor et al. (2008) evaluated the factors that influenced psychological distress during the equine influenza [20] . Sprang and Silman (2013) used a mixed-method design to investigate children's psychosocial responses to the H1N1 pandemic, and in their qualitative study [21] , Denis-Ramirez et al. (2017) explored the psychosocial impact of the Ebola epidemic in the daily lives of children in low-resource communities [18] . The most-reported outcome in these studies was the negative impact of a pandemic/epidemic on psychological health, which the researchers measured as anxiety, depression, fear, stigma, and posttraumatic stress symptoms. These studies reported that pandemics cause stress, worry, helplessness, and social and risky behavioral problems among children and adolescents (e.g., substance abuse, suicide, relationship issues, academic issues, absenteeism from work). Studies on the COVID-19 pandemic reported that the current pandemic has significantly affected the emotional and behavioral experience of children and adolescents [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Depression and anxiety were higher among children and adolescents in other pandemics, and specifically COVID-19 [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The researchers also reported that age, gender, knowledge about COVID-19, degree of worry about epidemiological infection, and confidence about overcoming the outbreak significantly influenced the participants' psychological status [28] . Studies also reported that female adolescents showed higher depression and anxiety levels during COVID-19 than male adolescents did [23] [24] [25] 32, 33] .",

The psychological distress of fear, helplessness, worry, anxiety-related insomnia, isolation, boredom, and sadness was more common in the quarantine group [30] . These findings indicate that pandemic disasters, the subsequent disease-control measures, and containment responses can create conditions that families and children find traumatic. Sprang and Silman (2013) measures posttraumatic stress disorder using Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Reaction Index (PTSD-RI), and the PTSD Check List among children who experienced social distancing measures during the H1N1 pandemic [21] . The study found posttraumatic stress disorder in up to 30% of the children who were quarantined compared to those who had not been in isolation or quarantine during the H1N1 pandemic (1.1%; x 2 = 49.56, p < 0.001) [21] .",

(2019) implemented a community psychosocial program with the aim of improving the mental health capacity of children aged 3-18 years during the Ebola epidemic [17] . The children received the interventions in settings where childhood trauma was prevalent. These interventions included expressive-art therapies, yoga therapy, and play therapy to help children to build healthy relationships, teach them child-specific trauma-coping skills, and build a safe space for children to express themselves. Of the 40 chosen sites, the children at 24 received a five-month intervention (Treatment Group 1), whereas at the remaining 16 sites they received three months of intervention (Treatment Group 2). Decosimo et al. (2019) found a statistically significant difference in the mean scores of 0.06 in treatment group 1 and 0.11 in treatment group 2, with a p-value of <0.001 pre-and postintervention. They also found a significant difference in the psychological stress symptoms over time before and after the children received the intervention. The findings indicate that the longer programming did not differ statistically from the shorter programming [17] . Kamara et al. (2017) focused on the mental health of children and adolescents aged 0-17 years during the Ebola virus epidemic in Sierra Leone, when the psychiatric hospital was closed to admissions to prevent disease transmission [19] . To provide mental health services in Sierra Leone, Kamara et al. (2017) established a nurse-led mental health and psychosocial support service at one of the largest government hospitals in the country, which had approximately 300 beds. To equip the nurses to provide mental health services, the WHO, CBM International, and local partners gave them psychological first-aid training focused on supporting those affected by the Ebola virus disease. These nurses prescribed medications in collaboration with physicians, and the children received counseling and a problem-solving approach to deal with their psychological suffering. The most commonly diagnosed mental health problems among the children and adolescents included distress, anxiety, depression, grief, and other social problems. Kamara et al. (2017) found that training nurses to manage mental health issues is an effective measure to strengthen the local capacity [19] .",

The results are overwhelming and demonstrate that pandemics are precursors to mental health decline [18, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . Specifically, impairments in mental health leave children and adolescents with increased emotional stress, feelings of helplessness, and fear, which can evolve into mental illnesses such as anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms [18, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] . The consequences of the decline in mental health in young populations lead to engagement in unhealthy behaviors such as substance abuse, absenteeism from work, and school interruptions [22, 24, 27, 28, 33] . These results demonstrate that pandemics markedly contribute to a wide breadth of negative mental health consequences for children and adolescents, which establishes the critical need to explore effective strategies to promote positive mental health during pandemics.",

Despite the evidence that declining mental health status during the COVID-19 pandemic is not unique to this population, this review illuminates that age-specific coping strategies are necessary to target the distinct needs of children and adolescents. Decosimo et al. (2019) revealed the positive impacts of age-specific mental health-promoting interventions during the Ebola pandemic: art therapies, yoga theory, play therapy, and collaboration with child life specialists. Although these interventions have revealed a significant difference in the psychological stress symptoms in children [17] , it is critical that researchers explore alternative strategies to improve mental health outcomes during the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

Studies have shown that smartphone/internet overuse can lead to mental or behavioral problems, cause poor studying performance, decrease real-life social interactions, result in neglect of their personal lives, and cause relationship disorders and mood dysfunction [36, 37] . Despite the host of negative mental health outcomes for children and adolescents from the overuse of the Internet during a pandemic, as we reported earlier, there are limited age-specific and feasible interventions to combat this. Specifically, it is imperative that we target coping strategies for children and adolescents within the COVID-19 pandemic measures (e.g., social distancing, school closures) and resource constraints (e.g., the capacity of parents, healthcare providers, and child life specialists) to optimize the feasibility of current mental health interventions. Mental health coping strategies should focus on measures that can be modified, such as innovative and age-appropriate research materials for children and adolescents.",

Translating researchinformed evidence into educational materials will help to synthesize and tailor reliable information to the needs of its end-users [38] . In the case of younger populations, developing age-appropriate research-informed educational resources (such as videos, infographics, and comic books) can offer solutions to decrease adolescents' mental health decline by improving their knowledge on pandemics. Keeping children and adolescents well informed through these modifiable strategies will target fear, worry, and stress about the unknown. As a result, it will alleviate the psychological distress and associated risky social and behavioral problems of children and adolescents, as we reported earlier [23, 24, 26, 27, 30, 32] . Because depression and anxiety disorders are associated with the closure of schools, physical-distancing measures, and the increased time that children and adolescents spend online during pandemics [18, 21, 24, 25, 29, 30, 34] , delivering informative educational materials through online media will give adolescents an opportunity to utilize their online hours productively by staying well-informed.",

Exploring effective channels regarding the development and delivery of evidenced-based age-appropriate educational materials is vital to future investigations on mental health. Moreover, it is essential to transcend the homogeneous tendency to develop and implement mental health interventions for children and adolescents. Amid this target population, gender, age, and educational needs vary, which the interventions that promote the overall mental health of children and adolescents must reflect.

Due to the short period of data collection there is a possibility of missing studies relevant to the mental health care of children and adolescents. Moreover, there is the possibility of publication bias i.e., only significant findings being published. One of the difficulties in comparing the studies in this review was the heterogeneity in the outcome measures. Therefore, we were not able to conduct meta-analyses. Moreover, the majority of the studies included in the review were based on online self-reports. The cross-sectional studies are useful in understanding the immediate or short-term impact apparent at a certain point of time. However, the limitations of these cross-sectional studies are that these studies cannot reach a conclusion about the long-term impact of pandemics. It is important to note that this rapid review could not prospectively examine changes in mental health outcomes as a result of this pandemic. Therefore, long-term impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and elevated rates of mental health symptoms due to the pandemic could not be concluded in our study findings.",

With the objective of universal prevention and mental health promotion, it is important that children and adolescents should be informed about the pandemic situations. With the aim to increase children's awareness about pandemics, it is crucial for parents, teachers and healthcare providers to communicate with young children in an age appropriate manner by using simple terminologies about COVID-19. Children need to be given fact-based information with the help of presentations and video material provided by authorized international organizations like WHO and UNICEF or government resources which have been tailor made especially for children. Adolescents are expected to have better knowledge about COVID 19 compared to young children. Therefore, communication has to be more open and non-directive with them.",

Efforts should be made so that a consistent routine is followed by the child and adolescents during school closure, with enough opportunities to play, read, rest, and engage in physical activity. It is recommended that families play board games and engage in indoor sports activities with their children to avoid longer durations of video games. Parents should ensure that particularly the bedtime of a child is consistent. Similarly, excessive and irresponsible use of social media or internet gaming should be cautioned against. Negotiations with adolescents to limit their time and internet-based activities are recommended. More nongadget related indoor activities and games are to be encouraged. There is also a need for evidence based elaborative strategies and a plan of action to cater to the mental health needs of children and adolescents during the period of pandemic.",

They can assist in teaching simple exercises, including deep breathing, muscle relaxation, distraction, and positive self -talk. Virtual workshops can be conducted in which \"life skills\" related to coping in stress can be in focus by using more practical examples. There is a need to enhance children's and adolescents' access to mental health services by using both face to face as well as digital platforms. There is a need for more virtual mental well-being programs in order to mitigate significant COVID-19 related mental health crises in children and adolescents for the duration of the current crisis and beyond. Finally, there is a pressing need for carrying out longitudinal and developmental studies to be able to apprehend multiple layers of dynamic determinants playing a role during this time of global crisis.",

The real time analysis generated through our knowledge synthesis will be useful in developing evidence-based policy and practices during the current pandemic and will be transferable into future pandemic context.
