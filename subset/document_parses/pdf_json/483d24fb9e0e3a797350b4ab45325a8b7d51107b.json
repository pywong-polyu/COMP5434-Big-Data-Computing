Previous works observed that citations are made not only based on the pure scholarly contributions but also based on non-scholarly attributes, such as the affiliation or gender of authors. In this way, citation bias is produced. Existing works, however, have not analyzed preprints with respect to citation bias, although they play an increasingly important role in modern scholarly communication. In this paper, we investigate whether preprints are affected by citation bias with respect to the author affiliation. We measure citation bias for bioRxiv preprints and their publisher versions at the institution level and country level, using the Lorenz curve and Gini coefficient. This allows us to mitigate the effects of confounding factors and see whether or not citation biases related to author affiliation have an increased effect on preprint citations. We observe consistent higher Gini coefficients for preprints than those for publisher versions. Thus, we can confirm that citation bias exists and that it is more severe in case of preprints. As preprints are on the rise, affiliationbased citation bias is, thus, an important topic not only for authors (e.g., when deciding what to cite), but also to people and institutions that use citations for scientific impact quantification (e.g., funding agencies deciding about funding based on citation counts).",

Widely used importance metrics, such as the citation count and the h-index [15] , are based on citations. They are sometimes used to judge the quality of research presented by an article [26] . However, several works have observed that publications are cited not only based on the pure scholarly contributions but also based on nonscholarly attributes such as gender, author affiliation, and funding. For instance, articles authored by women might be under-cited [4, 7, 35] .

Several preprint servers have emerged within the last decades [40] , covering various disciplines: arXiv in physics, mathematics, and computer science, bioRxiv in biology, medRxiv in medicine, and SSRN in social science. Various works have observed benefits of preprints, such as early disclosure, wider dissemination [32] resulting in a higher number of citations [6, 10, 12] , and creating opportunities for collaborations [20, 29, 32] .

[33] observed that 35% of respondents consider the author's institution as extremely or very important to assess the credibility of preprints. Therefore, we assume that author affiliation has an influence on the citation counts of preprints. We verify the existence of citation bias by computing citation inequality. To this end, we measure to which degree the number of citations that preprints and their publisher versions receive is unequally distributed. Specifically, we measure citation bias with regard to author affiliation on the institution level and country level. Comparing differences in the citation inequality between preprints and their respective publisher versions allows us to mitigate the effects of confounding factors and see whether or not citation biases related to author affiliation have an increased effect on preprint citations. Conclusions drawn from this type of investigation are based on the assumption that the process of peer-review and formal publication is generally perceived as an assurance of quality [26] and therefore \"levels the playing field\" among articles in terms of citability.",

We use the COCI (OpenCitations Index of Crossref open DOI-to-DOI references) [14] as citation data. To measure citation inequality, we calculate the Gini coefficients , following previous studies [9, 25] . In our analysis, we can confirm a citation bias, especially for preprints at different affiliation levels (i.e., institutions, countries), as we find that preprints have twice the citation inequality as the publisher versions (e.g., = 0.23 for preprints and = 0.12 for publisher versions at the institution level). Furthermore, we observe larger citation inequalities for preprints than those for publisher versions in different journal types that are mega-journals 1 , disciplinary journals, and prestigious journals (e.g., Nature and Science).",

Specifically, they identified three categories with 28 factors to be related to the number of citations: paper related factors (e .g., quality of paper, document type), journal related factors (e .g., journal impact factor), and author(s) related factors (e .g., number of authors). They concluded that some factors, such as the journal impact factor, international cooperation, and number of authors, are more strongly correlated with the number of citations than the other factors. These factors include non-scholarly attributes such as gender, author affiliation, and funding. This phenomenon of inequality can be referred to as \"citation bias,\" and it distorts the perception of available scholarly contributions among users of articles [17] . Several studies found that papers authored by women might be under-cited [4, 7, 35] , while Copenheaver et al. [5] did not observe citation bias based on gender. Lou and He [23] observed a significant negative correlation between the reputation of author affiliations (i .e., rank of an affiliation at the U.S. News Best Global University Subject rankings) and uncitedness of journal articles.",

Besides the citation bias, also other kinds of biases in academia have been studied. For instance, Liang et al. [22] discussed the recommender systems' \"exposure problem, \" which can result in frequent recommendation of popular scientific articles. Salman et al. [31] observed gender and racial biases and location-based biases in academic expert recommendations, used to find reviewers or to assemble a conference program committee. Polonioli et al. [30] claimed that recommender systems might put users in information bubbles by isolating them from exposure to different academic viewpoints, creating a self-reinforcing bias damaging to scientific progress. Finally, Gupta et al. [13] found that scholarly recommender systems are biased as they underexpose users to equally relevant items. A paper that tackles the popularity bias of recommending scientific articles [39] won the Test of Time award at the KDD 2021 conference. 2 All this shows that bias is an important and timely topic to consider.",

Specifically, we plot the Lorenz curve and calculate the Gini coefficient [8] to measure inequality in the number of citations, as used by authors of similar studies, such as Nielsen and Andersen [25] . In this paper, the Lorenz curve presents the distribution of citations accumulated across different affiliations, where it shows for the bottom % of affiliations, what percentage ( %) of the total number of citations they received. If the distribution of the number of citations for different affiliations is perfectly equal, the Lorenz curve is depicted by the straight line = . The Gini coefficient is calculated as the ratio of the area between the line of perfect equality and the observed Lorenz curve to the area between the line of perfect equality and the line of perfect inequality. The Gini coefficient can range from 0 to 1. A higher Gini coefficient indicates a high degree of inequality in the distribution.",

One of them is the number of months from publication of a preprint to its publisher version. Peer-review is thought to improve the credibility of articles [33] , leading to increased citations. The distribution of the number of months from publication of a preprint to its publisher version varies greatly among journals and articles. If the number of articles by journal and the number of months from publication of a preprint to its publisher version are unbalanced among affiliations, the results shown in Figure 2 and Table 1 would be biased. Hence, we explore the Gini coefficients for preprints and publisher versions grouped by months from publication of a preprint to its publisher version. We consider institutions and countries that have published at least 3 and 5 articles at each month, respectively. Figures 3 and 4 show the Gini coefficients at institution and country levels, along with the number of articles and affiliations. In these figures, we set all authors as target authors. For instance, as can be seen in Figure 3 , the Gini coefficient of citations of preprints that have been published 8 months after publication is 0.30. We observe larger Gini coefficients for preprints than those for publisher versions with one exception at the country level (e.g., articles that spend 18 months from publication of the preprint to its publisher version, as can be seen in Figure 4 ). The differences between Gini coefficients get smaller as the duration between the publication of a preprint to its publisher version gets longer. This is because Gini coefficients for preprints get smaller while those for publisher versions become slightly larger. These tendencies are caused by the length of the observation period of citations. For example, if a publisher version has been published 5 months after preprint publication, the observation period of citations for the preprint and 13 The full list of countries is as follows: China, Australia, Switzerland, Japan, Italy, Finland, Singapore, Austria, New Zealand, Portugal, Czechia, Mexico, Argentina, Hungary, Ireland, Taiwan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Thailand, Malaysia, Estonia, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Slovenia, Luxembourg, Vietnam.
