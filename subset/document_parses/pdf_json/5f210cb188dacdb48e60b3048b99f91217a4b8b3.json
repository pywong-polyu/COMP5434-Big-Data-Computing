In addition, clinicians are the end-users of the technology invented to solve patient's unmet medical needs. These two factors combined give clinicians the ability to play a critical role in biomedical innovation. Historically, innovation in medical training was essential due to necessity, and as such, an important skill of being a physician. Most notably, Dr. Edward Jenner invented the first vaccine for smallpox, after realizing people who received small aliquots of the infection gained immunity, thereby saving millions of lives and ultimately leading to the eradication of smallpox worldwide [1] . Similarly, in order to understand the systems of the body through minimally invasive methods, Nobellaureate and physician Dr. Willem Einthoven invented the ECG to characterize the electrical currents of the heart, and the gynecologist, Dr. Karl Theo Dussik, pioneered the first use of the ultrasound [2].",

            "text": "How to identify and solve unmet needs through innovation training should begin early in medical school and continue longitudinally through residency and beyond. In our prior survey study, over 60% of physicians had no training in innovation, although the majority wanted more training [3] . The innovation curriculum should emphasize the goal of cultivating patient-centered innovation where clinicians identify problems worth solving, practice divergent and convergent brainstorming, collaborate with stakeholders, prototype and commercialize solutions. Throughout this journey of innovation, learners should have the opportunity to partner with other expert clinicians and non-physicians (e.g., scientists, engineers) to select which patient problems are worth solving and what solutions are worthy of further development and testing [4] . Early introduction to this problem-based innovation design process could be extremely helpful in mobilizing physicians to help identify problems and solutions quickly during a crisis, such as a pandemic. One such program, the Magic Wand Initiative, has been created at Harvard Medical School, and successfully implemented a clinician-driven program to cultivate patient-centered innovation at Massachusetts General Hospital Department of Dermatology [5] . The outcomes from this program have clearly demonstrated that when clinicians are educated and empowered to identify and solve problems, new and innovative solutions are brought to clinic to improve patient care [6] . Blake et al. showed through a review and thematic analysis that there were thirteen medical education programs in the USA participating in Innovation and Entrepreneurship curriculums [7] . Furthermore, Cohen et al. showed that the return on investment of Innovation and Entrepreneurship programs on the undergraduate level at the University of Michigan resulted in 18 novel projects with patent filings, three schoolwide shark tank competitions and 6 start-up companies [8] . Ultimately, expanding similar training programs will empower clinicians with the skillsets to easily identify and convey unmet medical needs to non-clinicians 4 , especially in times of need.",

They noted successful innovation for medical-device startups is heavily dependent on participation of doctors because of their unique insight on medical problems and developed technologies but concluded that many doctors do not have the training or skills to manage the broader process of innovation. Thus, the ability to integrate multidisciplinary teams to include those with physicians, engineers, and business managers are critical to making medical innovation come to fruition [9] .",
