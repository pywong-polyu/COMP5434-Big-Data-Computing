Medical student outreach remains crucial and should include the coordination of teaching and networking events with groups such as the Student National Medical Association, an organization committed to supporting current and future under-represented minority medical students. We must encourage and support diversity scholarships to attract minority students to visiting sub-internships and pay special attention to recruitment efforts at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) as none of the six HBCU Medical Schools has accredited urology training programmes. Additionally, residency programme leadership must engage in careful application reviews and avoid using single thresholds like USMLE STEP 1 scores to triage applicants. This screening process may unintentionally perpetuate the problem, as research shows that multiple historical inequities have led to substantial gaps in standardized testing scores between races 10 . Moreover, programmes must purposefully educate faculty and trainees on racial and ethnic disparities through frequent activities such as grand-rounds and journal clubs and must work to fight against racism in people's everyday behaviours. Finally, the major organizations and associations within urology should aim to improve diversity and inclusion within their governing officer positions and the honours bestowed upon its members.",
