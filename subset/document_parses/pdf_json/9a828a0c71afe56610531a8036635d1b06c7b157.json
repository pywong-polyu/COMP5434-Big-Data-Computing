However, with the unprecedented proliferation of smart devices and the rapid expansion of IoT networks, 5G cannot completely meet the rising technical criteria, e.g., autonomous, ultra-large-scale, highly dynamic and fully intelligent services. The fast growth of automated and intelligent IoT networks is likely to exceed the capability of the 5G wireless systems. Moreover, the emergence of new IoT services and applications such as remote robotic surgery and flying vehicles, also requires further advances in current 5G systems for improving the quality of IoT service delivery and business [4] .",

These levels of capacity will be unprecedented and will accelerate the applications and deployments of 6G-based IoT networks across the realms of IoT data sensing, device connectivity, wireless communication, and 6G network management. Enabled by the great potential of 6G-IoT, many efforts have been put into research in this promising area. For instance, Finland has sponsored the first 6G project named 6Genesis [5] , and built the world's first experimental 6G-IoT research environment. Nokia has launched Hexa-X [9] , a new European 6G flagship research initiative from January 1, 2021, aiming to develop the vision for future 6G systems for connecting human, physical and digital worlds in future IoT networks through the collaboration of prominent European network vendors, communication service providers, and research institutes. Furthermore, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has opened the Terahertz (THz) spectrum band which allows researchers and engineers to test 6G functions on mobile communications systems and IoT devices [10] .

            "text": "Driven by the recent advances of wireless networks and IoT, some research efforts have been made to review related works. Specifically, the study in [12] provided a brief discussion on the potential technologies for 6G to enable mobile AI applications and the analysis of the AI-enabled solutions for 6G network design and optimization. A speculative study on 6G was given in [13] where the authors indicated the visionary technologies potentially used in future 6G networks and applications. The use cases in 6G wireless networks were summarized in [14] , while the recent advances in wireless communication toward 6G were presented in [15] . The works in [16] , [17] presented a survey on the vision of future 6G wireless communication and its network architecture, with a focus on the analysis of enabling technologies for 6G networks. A more comprehensive survey on 6G wireless communications and networks was provided in [18] , where the authors paid attention to the illustration of the tentative roadmap of definition, specification, standardization, and regulation in 6G technologies. The potential 6G requirements and the latest research activities related to 6G were also discussed in [19] , while the survey in [20] provided a holistic discussion of various essential technologies in 6G. The comparison of the related works and our paper is summarized in Table I. Although 6G has been studied extensively in the literature, there is no existing work to provide a comprehensive and dedicated survey on the integration of 6G and IoT, to the best of our knowledge. Notably, a holistic discussion on the emerging 6G-IoT applications such as Vehicular Internet of Things, Autonomous Driving, and Satellite Internet of Things is still missing in the open literature. These limitations motivate us to conduct a holistic review on the convergence of 6G and IoT. Particularly, we identify and discuss the most fundamental 6G technologies for enabling IoT networks, including edge intelligence, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, space-air-groundunderwater communications, THz communications, massive URLLC communications, and blockchain. It is worth noting that while the existing works [14] - [18] only focus on the discussion of fundamental technologies for enabling wireless communications and networks, we here highlight the 6G technologies which directly influence the IoT applications and network in a holistic manner, from intelligence (e.g., edge intelligence), communications (e.g., massive URLLC communications) to security (e.g., blockchain). The representative use cases on the integration of 6G technologies and IoT are also explored and analyzed. Subsequently, we present an extensive discussion on the use of these 6G technologies in a wide range of newly emerging IoT applications via five domains, i.e., Internet of Healthcare Things, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Vehicular Internet of Things and Autonomous Driving, Satellite Internet of Things, and Industrial Internet of Things. The taxonomy tables are also provided to give more insights into the convergence of 6G and IoT. Finally, we discuss a number of important research challenges and highlight interesting future directions in 6G-IoT. These technical contributions thus make our article fundamentally different from the existing 1) We present a holistic discussion of the convergence of 6G and IoT, starting from an introduction to the recent advances in 6G and IoT and the discussion of the technical requirements of their integration. 2) We extensively discuss the fundamental 6G technologies which are envisioned to enable IoT networks, including edge intelligence, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces, space-air-ground-underwater communications, THz communications, massive URLLC, and blockchain. 3) We then provide an extensive survey and discussion of the roles of 6G in prospective IoT applications in five key domains, namely Healthcare Internet of Things, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Vehicular Internet of Things and Autonomous Driving, Satellite Internet of Things, and Industrial Internet of Things. The representative use cases in each 6G-IoT application domain are highlighted and discussed. Moreover, taxonomy tables to summarize the key technical aspects and contributions of each 6G-IoT use case are also provided. 4) We identify several important research challenges and then discuss possible directions for future research toward the full realization of 6G-IoT.",

IoT data can be collected from ubiquitous mobile devices such as sensors, actuators, smart phones, personal computers, and radio frequency identifications (RFIDs) to serve end users [21] . It is estimated that IoT will achieve an impressive development in the next few years. According to Cisco [22] , up to 500 billion IoT devices are expected to be connected to the Internet by 2030, from only 26 billion devices in 2020. Furthermore, in a new analysis of IHS Markit [23], a world leader in critical information, analytics and solutions, the development of connected global IoT devices will achieve an impressive rate of 12 percent annually, from nearly 27 billion in 2017 to 125 billion in 2030. Recently, GlobeNewswire also forecasts that the global 5G-IoT market will grow from USD 694.0 million in 2020 to USD 6,285.5 million by 2025 [24] . The Internet of Nano-Things is also significant to build future advanced IoT ecosystems [25] , where the network of objects (nano-devices and things) can sense, transmit, process, and store data based on nano units (e.g., a nanocontroller) for supporting customer services such as healthcare monitoring. Seamless interconnectivity among nano-networks via the available communication networks and the Internet requires developing new network architectures and new communication paradigms. In this context, 6G with its exceptional features and strong capabilities will be a key enabler for supporting future IoT networks and applications, by providing full-dimensional wireless coverage, and integrating all functionalities, from sensing, communication, computing, to intelligence and fully autonomous control. In fact, the next generation 6G mobile networks are envisaged to provide massive coverage and better scalability to facilitate IoT connectivity and service delivery, compared to the 5G mobile network [26] .",

Broadband access platforms along with satellite networks enabled by using low earth orbit (LEO) satellites [27] will be the key enabler for supporting largescale communications of future smart devices. Furthermore, the use of flying platforms such as UAVs are also needed to support seamless connectivity over the future large-scale IoT networks where fixed base stations cannot manage to ensure stable and reliable device communications in moving IoT networks. For example, a distributed UAV deployment prototype is presented in [28] in the context of 6G networks, by using 33 UAVs to provide wireless connectivity for 400 terrestrial IoT users over the coverage of 2000 m x 2000 m area. Given the UE distribution and corresponding discontinuous UAV location space, a distributed motion algorithm is developed which allows each UAV to autonomously obtain the optimal position in a continuous IoT space. Simulations indicate that the use of swarm of UAVs is able to obtain the maximum load balance near to 1 by the distributed deployment solution, with the deployment time reduced by up to 40% compared to the centralized method.",

For example, in the future autonomous transportation systems, where vehicles are self-controlled and navigated in real-time, the massive URLLC is highly necessary for transporting video feeds from cameras to vehicles and coordinating the timely vehicle signalling on the roads in an automated and safe manner. In the future, timeliness of information delivery will be a significant feature for the intelligent interconnected society where the tactile internet will dominate to offer haptic communications for mission-critical IoT services with touch and actuation in real-time. As an case study, the work in [30] implements a massive URLLC-based IoT simulation for 6G IoT networks by designing a short range wireless isochronous real-time in-X subnetwork with communication cycles shorter than 0.1 ms and outage probability below 10 \u22126 . A dense IoT scenario is considered with up to two devices per m 2 using a multi-GHz spectrum for providing high spatial service availability. By conducting a semi-analytical system evaluation analysis, it is revealed that the cycle times are a factor of x10 shorter than the latency targets of 5G radio technologies (i.e., below 0.1 ms) which is potentially applied to future ultra-low latency IoT applications such as autonomous driving, real-time health monitoring, and industrial automation.",

In such a context, network communication standards and protocols play an important role in deploying 6G-IoT ecosystems at large-scale due to the integration with other important computing services such as edge/cloud computing and wireless technologies. For example, the Industry Specification Group of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute has released the initiative called ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing [31] , which aims to leverage seamlessly edge computing and communication frameworks for IoT-based applications originating from vendors, developers and thirdparty service providers. This initiative could be a significant step to the deployment of future IoT applications at the network edge in the 6G network where IoT computing and storage are expected to be shifted from the network centre to the network edge. Recently, the IEEE 802.11 working group has initiated discussions on releasing the next generation of Wi-Fi standard, referred to as IEEE 802.11be Extremely High Throughput [32] , which can meet the peak throughput requirements set by upcoming IoT applications in the 6G era.

Edge intelligence and UAVs are the keys to achieving full wireless coverage where the former is able to provide autonomous and intelligent solutions at the network edge, while the latter can be used to build flying base stations to extend the coverage of current mobile networks from only 2D in existing terrestrial networks to 3D in an integrated terrestrial-satellite-aerial system. For example, high-altitude UAVs can be exploited as agile aerial platforms to enable on-demand maritime coverage [33] , as a promising solution to establish shore-based terrestrial based stations to facilitate the deployment of communications infrastructure for vessels on the ocean. To be clear, a practical automatic identification system is employed to obtain the vessel distribution with the offshore distance of the range of [20, 30] km. To provide an on-demand coverage of distributed vessels, UAVs are coordinated to move along with vessels for ensuring longterm broadband services. Here, an oil-powered fixed-wing UAV is adopted which can perform a 740 km round trip over the coastal area of about 370 km. Once the data transmission task at a vessel is accomplished, the UAV flies back to the charging station and continues serving the next vessel user in the queue. This communication pattern is unique from traditional UAV networks where IoT users are often fixed or have random distributions. 5) Next-generation Smart IoT Devices: Future 6G-IoT networks are predicted to rely on smart devices where edge intelligence and computing can be fully realized at the devices, e.g., smartphones, vehicles, machines and robots. device-centric network poses new challenges and requirements on the design and operation of its wireless communications, since smart devices will not only generate or exploit data, but will also actively join the network management and operation processes. Device-centric wireless solutions can be device-todevice communications or multi-hop cellular networks that are parts of the 3GPP roadmap [34] . In the 6G era, each IoT smart device can act as an end-user terminal which can provide connectivity and services (e.g., intelligent control, caching, and network signalling) to other devices at the network edge without the need for a centralized controller [35] . This can be extended to demand-driven opportunistic networking which is tailored to different user, service or network demands such as energy cost minimization or spectrum efficiency maximization for end-user devices [36] . Moreover, recent years have witnessed a proliferation in wearable devices whose functionalities are gradually replacing the roles of smartphones that are central in 4G/5G network generations. These new wearable devices are diverse, ranging from smart wearables to smart body implants which can play a pivotal role in the revolution of wearable IoT networks for driving the emerging human-centric 6G services.",

This leads to a new paradigm called edge intelligence [38] , [39] , which is envisioned by the convergence of AI, communications, and edge computation. Recently, some research efforts have been made to explore the potential of edge intelligence in 6G-IoT use cases. For instance, the work in [40] suggested a self-learning edge intelligence solution, aiming to identify and classify emerging unknown services from raw crowdsourcing data distributed across a wide geographical area with a case study in 6G-based vehicular networks. A latency-sensitive connected vehicular system is proposed that consists of six campus shuttles connected to two edge servers along with a mobile app to monitor the latency of wireless vehicular data transmission. A highly-efficient edge intelligence approach is employed, by equipping each vehicle with an AI-based generative adversarial network. This is able to generate synthetic data that can be directly produced by the edge server, which helps reduce the data volume required to upload from the user and mitigate the total traffic transported throughout the network. However, the proposed self-learning architecture has not yet considered user mobility that can closely affect the latency in AI training among distributed vehicles. Moreover, the role of edge intelligence in 6G-IoT is also discussed in [41] where some dominant use cases are taken into account, such as autonomous driving. Edge intelligence is foreseen as a key enabler for dynamic spectrum access to provide fast and reliable AI-based data processing at the edge devices, e.g., platoons, vehicles on the street, and road side units. The benefits of edge intelligence are also considered for collaborative robots (or cobots) in smart manufacturing, with possible applied domains like automatic monitoring of machine health properties, autonomous or semiautonomous navigation, and fine-grained control of cobots. Moreover, ubiquitous edge devices can run AI functions to offer large-scale edge intelligence services enabled by big data analytics [42] . In this context, the information asset characterized by high volume, velocity and variety of big data is exploited to realize AI-based data analytics for its transformation into useful information to serve IoT users. Particularly, the 6G-based big data analysis technology can significantly enhance the large-scale data transmission and data computation rates based on advanced communication technologies such as massive URLLC and space-air-groundunderwater communications. Along with edge computing, fog computing also allows for relieving the load on cloud servers by offering computation and storage at fog nodes close to the IoT devices for improving the QoS [43] . Fog nodes would be useful to incorporate idle and spare resources of all available devices to further enhance network efficiency, especially in distributed IoT networks where cloud computing cannot handle all users' computation demands. Fog computing can be combined with AI techniques to realize fog intelligence for providing smart and low-latency IoT services in the future 6G era.",

            "text": "Recently, federated learning (FL) [44] as a distributed collaborative AI approach is emerging to transform edge/fog intelligence architectures. Conceptually, FL is a distributed AI approach which enables training of high-quality AI models by averaging local updates aggregated from multiple learning edge clients without the need for direct access to the local data [45] . For example, in the context of intelligent IoT networks, distributed IoT devices can collaboratively work with a data aggregator (e.g., an edge server) to perform neural network training where devices only exchange the parameters while raw data sharing is not needed, as illustrated in Fig. 5 . With its working concept, FL can offer several unique features to IoT networks. One of the most important features is the ability to enhance data privacy based on the distributed model training without sharing raw data to external servers. Following the increasingly stringent data privacy protection legislation such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the capability of protecting user information in FL is essential for building future safe 6G-IoT systems. Another feature is that FL enables low-latency network communications by avoiding the offloading of huge data volumes to the remote server in the training process. This capability also helps save much network spectrum resources required for iterative data training. Additionally, the cooperation of massive IoT devices for contributing large-scale datasets and computation resources in the FL system would accelerate the convergence rate of the overall training process and thus improve learning performances, e.g., accuracy rates, for better intelligent 6G-IoT services. A case study of FL-enabled edge intelligence in the 6G-IoT context is provided in [46] . Motivated by the privacy leakage issues in AI training, an approach called Air-Ground Integrated Federated Learning (AGIFL) is employed to evaluate the effect of different UAV's hovering location deployment schemes with privacy awareness. Here, multiple terrestrial nodes (e.g., mobile users) are regarded as clients to join the collaborative training with the server deployed at the UAV. In this setting, each user performs local training using its own dataset and sends the updated parameter to the UAV which aggregates all received updates to build a global model before giving it back to all participating users for the next round of training during the location deployment. By implementing simulations on image classification tasks using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on classical handwritten digit datasets, the proposed AGIFL-based method shows a promising classification accuracy performance (the accuracy rate achieves up to 95%), compared to non-federated schemes in the 6G context. In the near future, the security for local gradient computation at UAVs should be taken into account in federated training, by integrating attack detection methods such as access control and data authentication.",

Embedded AI functions can provide on-device learning inference with low latency compared to cloud-based AI training. The deployment of AI on hardware opens up new interesting on-device IoT applications, such as mobile smart object detection, and mobile human recognition. For example, a binary neural networks (BNNs) engine is developed in [47] based on graphics processing units (GPUs) for Android devices that optimizes both software and hardware for running ML functions on resource-constrained devices, e.g., Android phones. The computation capability of BNN is exploited on mobile devices, decoupled with parallel optimizations with the OpenCL library toolkit for enabling real-time and reliable NN deployments on Android devices. The experimental results indicate that the mobile BNN architecture can achieve a learning accuracy of 95.3% and improve the capability of storage and CPU usage in BNN running by up to 20%. Another case study is presented in [48] , where a MobileNet app is designed for on-device CNN training on mobile devices for mobile localization applications in IoT networks.

Another security issue comes from untrusted edge devices that can exploit the private information extracted from gradient exchange in the collaborative training, which thus also introduces high risks of data breaches. Therefore, future security solutions should be proposed for a safe and reliable edge intelligence ecosystem in future 6G-IoT networks. For example, decentralizing the data learning can be a feasible choice for edge intelligence systems, where blockchain ledgers can be adopted to verify the computation process of edge intelligence models. It can be done by using allowing edge blockhain peers to authorize the accuracy of the common AI model without revealing the labels of datasets.

Another case study is presented in [53] , where RISs are integrated in VIoT-based vehicle-tovehicle (V2V) networks consisting of a RIS-based access point for transmission and a RIS-based relay deployed on a building for coordinating the vehicular communications. RISs are also considered in [54] to support radio-frequency (RF) sensing for human posture recognition in IoT applications such as surveillance and remote health monitoring. By periodically programming RIS configurations in a human posture recognition system, the optimal propagation links can be obtained so that the system can create multiple independent paths that accumulate the useful information of human postures to estimate better the human posture recognitions in comparison with the random configuration and the non-configurable environment cases.",

Enabled from the mm-wave spectrum, the THz band (0.1-10 THz) is promising to fulfill the future requirements of 6G-IoT applications, including picosecond level symbol duration, integration of thousands of submillimeter-long antennas, and weak interference without full legacy regulation [61] . One of the key benefits of THz spectrum is to deal with the spectrum scarcity problems in wireless communications and significantly enhance wireless system capacities in 6G-IoT. Moreover, THz communications also provide ultra-high bandwidth and high throughput, which support ultra-broadband applications such as virtual reality and wireless personal area networks. Inspired by the unique features of THz communications, several IoT studies have been implemented in the context of 6G. Recently, THz communication technologies have been used for user localization by exploiting the ultra-wide bandwidths available at THz frequencies [62] . This allows the receivers to address spaced multipath components and effectively measure the signal sent by the transmitters for estimating correctly the user location. THz bands are also exploited for UAVs communications [62] , aiming to analyze the coverage probability of UAV networks with respect to the THz base station density and the strength of THz signals. The work in [63] focuses on modelling THz communication channels in VIoT-based vehicular networks and configurations of hybrid beamforming subarray by taking transmit power consumption into account in different scenarios, such as the fully-connected, sub-connected and overlapped subarray structures. By using a cellular infrastructure-toeverything application consisting of both cellular and vehicular communications with 1000 channels and multiple pedestrian users and high-mobility vehicles, the analysis of antenna array structures can be performed. Simulation results show a balanced performance trade-off in terms of spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, and hardware costs between the popular fully-connected structures in VIoT communications with THz massive MIMO. This trend is expected to continue in various areas of THz band-based IoT communications such as channel modeling and spectrum allocation. In the future, time-varying THz communication issues caused by the high mobility of vehicle should be considered, which could be addressed by predictable AI approaches such as dynamic DRL algorithms.",

The use of AI becomes more significant when the network information is unavailable and the network environment is highly dynamic. For example, the work in [68] exploits DL to a mURLLC-based virtual robotic arm system where deep neural networks (DNNs) are applied to predict accurately arm positions and control robotic arms with a duration of 1 ms. Deep transfer learning is also adopted in the DL architecture to fine-tune the pre-trained DNNs in non-stationary networks for improving the learning efficiency. Moreover, DRL has been used in [69] for optimizing the distributed cooperative sub-channel assignment and transmission power control which aims to provide the strict reliability and latency requirements of URLLC services. By using DRL, each mobile IoT device is able to intelligently make decision on its spectrum access based on its own instantaneous observations, aiming to optimize its sub-channel assignment and transmission power control. Then, a proper QoS-aware reward function is derived to manage the energy efficiency and QoS requirements of all IoT users. Experiments are implemented in a URLLC-based IoT environment with 2000 devices, the minimum data rate requirement is set to 3.5 bps/Hz, and the reliability requirement varies between 99.9% and 99.99999%. Implementation results demonstrate a much better energy efficiency by using DRL, compared to other conventional random approaches.

Moreover, how to ensure data privacy in the open sharing systems in multi-layer 6G systems such as vehicular data sharing in autonomous driving is a critical issue. Blockchain [71] , as an emerging disruptive technology, is able to offer innovative solutions to effectively deal with such privacy and security challenges in 6G-IoT networks. Conceptually, the blockchain is a decentralized, immutable and transparent database where no any authority is needed to manage the data. This is enabled by a peerto-peer network topology which allows each entity, e.g., an IoT device, to hold an equal right to control and authorize the data stored in the blockchain. Generally, blockchains can be classified as either a public (permission-less) or a private (permissioned) blockchain. A public blockchain allows anyone to perform transactions and join in the consensus process. The best-known public blockchain applications include Bitcoin and Ethereum. Private blockchains on the other hand are an invitation-only network managed by a central entity, and a participant who wants to join the blockchain network needs to be permissioned via a validation mechanism. Enabled by its working concept, blockchain boasts a number of desirable characteristics, including decentralization, traceability, trustworthiness, and immutability. These features make blockchain a promising candidate to be integrated into 6G-IoT ecosystems for security and privacy provision. For secure access control in 6G-based IoT communication environments, a blockchainbased approach is proposed in [72] . The authors exploit the decentralization of immutability features of blockchain to develop a security mechanism for reliable resource access control and user privacy preservation. Specifically, for a secure access control, the states of the virtualized resources are modelled using a Q-learning approach that can learn the resource usage patterns to detect abnormal data access behaviours. In terms of privacy preserving, a joint method of low-latency and memory saving is used to augment the response success ratio, and to obtain the false positives of the connected users. The benefits of the proposed solution are verified by the high true positives (nearly 94%), accurate access denial and success ratio (nearly 92%). However, the mining latency caused by block verification in blockchain has not been considered yet, and the evaluation of data leakage probability is still missing.",

In fact, blockchain is able to establish secure autonomous systems where UAVs can act as blockchain clients to communicate with ground base stations, aiming to exchange and share data to fulfil their missions such as emergency search or environmental monitoring via a peerto-peer ledger, as illustrated in Fig. 6 . By using blockchain, UAVs, terrestrial users, and network operators can trust the data stored on the ledger with a shared control and tracing right provided over the distributed environment. Another possible IoT application is smart healthcare; the verification of health data 6G-based healthcare systems can be implemented by blockchain and its inherent smart contract technology [74] , where no third-party is required while a high degree of trust is ensured. Moreover, the application of blockchain in future 6G-IoT networks also might result in costs in terms of latency and energy usage. The mining process, e.g., block verification and information exchange among miners, leads to high network delays and consumes excessive energy. For example, in the Ethereum blockchain platform, miners need to run Proof-of-Work (PoW) which is computationally extensive and timeconsuming. Further, the repeated information exchange among multiple miners in the block verification also needs large bandwidth resources. Hence, it is essential to take operational costs into account when applying blockchain in future IoT networks.",

            "text": "The integration of 6G will revolutionize HIoT [76] by using its enabling technologies. The work in [77] discussed the potential use of 6G technologies such as mURLLC and THz communications for supporting extremely low-latency healthcare data transmission and accelerating medical network connections between wearables and remote doctors. In fact, healthcare domains such as remote health monitoring requires low-latency communications (below 1 ms) with the reliability requirement of above 99.999% to achieve nearly real-time health provision with a fast and reliable remote diagnosis. Interestingly, 6G robotics can be applied to implement remote surgery in a fashion that remote doctors can manage the surgery via the robotic systems at a latency of milliseconds and high reliability. Recently, a telesurgery system is also studied in [78] in the context of 6G by using UAVs and blockchain. Given the security risks in existing mobile surgery networks, blockchain is integrated into the robotic system where each robot acts as a data node so that surgical information is stored securely in the database ledger without the need of centralized authority. Particularly, smart contracts are also adopted that can provide automatic authentication for health data requests and control over the health data sharing during the surgery [79] . To solve the slow healthcare response rates, UAVs are employed as relays to transport light-weight healthcare items such as medicines and surgical tools among hospitals in emergent situations, which helps avoid road-traffic congestions and thus mitigates data exchange latency. Meanwhile, to achieve future requirements in terms of ultra-high data rates of medical data communications, the mURLLC technology is an ideal solution by using the THz bands in 6G-based healthcare networks [80] . Accordingly, nano-devices, implants, and onbody sensors can communicate and transmit data in real-time with extremely high reliability and availability to edge devices or cloud centres for short-and long-term medical analysis. In particular, mURLLC also plays a key role in hospitalbased telestration where doctors can monitor and manage the surgery procedure remotely using real-time video streaming from medical robotics and assistant devices interconnected by 6G core networks [81] . Moreover, 6G-based URLLC has been exploited to facilitate connected ambulance in future healthcare, by allowing real-time video streaming with high color resolution for reliable diagnosis to clinicians and paramedical staff from the hospital at moderately high speeds (up to 100 km/h) [82] . For example, electroencephalogram data from clinical examination can be conducted on-board and through URLLC-based real-time teleconsultation, hospital doctors are able to provide urgent indications to paramedical staff in the ambulance. In this scenario, a very small survival time must be ensured (below 2 ms) although the ambulance can run at high speeds.",

In this context, ML is also useful to optimize mobility management processes in 6G-based health networks, by taking data rates, traffic flows, data processing delays, and bandwidth resource allocation into account. Implementation results show a good trade-off between time and energy efficiency by using ML techniques while effectively managing and monitoring the mobility of the IoT driven devices in 6G-empowered industrial applications including healthcare services. Recently, COVID-19 has spread rapidly across the globe and become a major health concern of many countries. Wireless communication technologies such as URLLC, edge intelligence, and cloud computing have been applied to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in different ways [85] . For example, high-speed live video conferencing based on URLLC enables healthcare professionals to discuss with patients in a low-latency and reliable manner for timely COVID-19 outbreak analysis. COVID-19 data can be processed using data-driven edge intelligence techniques by integrating edge computing and AI for accurate and fast disease diagnosis [86] . Fig. 7 illustrates a case study of using edge intelligence for COVID-19 analysis, by applying FL at the network edge. Each edge server located at a local hospital institution is equipped with a local GAN consisting of a discriminator and a generator based on CNNs to learn the COVID-19 data distribution using its own local image dataset. Then, the local GANs synchronize and exchange the learned model parameters for aggregation at a cloud server, which then returns a new version of the global model to all institutions for the next training round. This process is repeated until a desired accuracy is achieved, aiming to generate realistic COVID-19 images for the detection of COVID-19. The use of edge intelligence thus offers unique benefits to COVID-19 analytics, including privacy protection and large-scale data processing capabilities.",

To do so, the idiosyncrasies of V2X are taken to strike a trade-off between scalability, reliability, and latency via a vehicle discovery approach in which a discovery entity located at the base station collects information about the proximity of the vehicles. Accordingly, to optimize the discovery scheme, signature properties such as time slots and hash functions are tuned, aiming to minimize the false-positive probability to schedule the radio resources for V2X data communications under the available spectrum budget. In future 6G-based VIoT, data rate prediction is a challenging task due to the complex interdependency between factors such as mobility, channels, and networking.

In this context, how to build trust for data learning and reasoning is highly important as the data training is normally treated as a process in a black box where the input and output are known only. Therefore, a trust broker entity is proposed for 6G-VIoT networks, which is able to provide reasoning for learning actions at the DL controller, e.g., the base station. Thus, the learning process can be interpreted so that business stakeholders can understand the data training process, e.g., which data features cause which decisions. Vehicular intelligence is also the focus in [92] where DL techniques are adopted to autonomously schedule the data transmission. This is enabled by using three approaches, supervised learning for data rate estimation, unsupervised learning for recognizing geospatially-dependent uncertainties of the estimation model, and reinforcement learning (RL) for autonomously coordinating data transmissions based on anticipated resource efficiency. This combined scheme is promising to achieve multi-objective optimization in VIoT, from resource allocation to data rate maximization. In the future, it is useful to develop cooperative DL approaches like FL since 6G-VIoT networks are expected to be highly scalable and distributed. In addition to network management, DL-based intelligent software is deployed at the vehicular data controller that is able to provide useful solutions for security protection in 6G-based VIoT networks [93] . A new weight-based ensemble DL approach is suggested to detect intrusion and attack risks in vehicular communications. Support vector machine is firstly used to map data to a highdimensional space through a kernel function and build the optimal classification hyperplane to extract the sample classes. K-neighborhood is then applied to determine the categories of extracted samples, which is then classified by a decision tree. Numerical results demonstrate the high performances of DL in terms of high attack detection accuracy (an increase of 5%-20%, compared to non-learning approaches), which thus helps improve the reliability and security of vehicle networks in 6G.",

In this context, cooperative driving is enabled through information sharing and driving coordination among vehicles, where DL can come as a natural solution to perform fast prediction of the V2V communication performance bounds for intelligent control of inter-vehicle distances.

The work in [97] considers a cell-free UAV network for 6G-based wide-area IoT with focus on a UAV flight process-oriented optimization. This can be done by formulating a data transmission efficiency maximization problem that can be solved by taking large-scale channel state information, on-board energy, and interference temperature constraints into account. The proposed approach is also promising to identify the cell-free coverage patterns to support massive access for wide-area IoT devices in the future 6G era. The authors in [98] propose a UAV-supported clustered non-orthogonal multiple access (C-NOMA) scheme [99] for supporting wireless powered communications in 6G-enabled IoT networks. Given the popularity of cluster IoT terminals, a terminal clustering strategy is adopted based on intracluster NOMA communications which allows UAV to transmit radio signals to IoT terminals. A synergetic optimization solution for UAV trajectory planning and subslot allocation is derived by portioning the downlink energy transfer subslot and uplink information transmission subslot. This aims to maximize the achievable sum rates of all IoT terminals which are confirmed via numerical simulations. Unlike the work in [98] , the project in [100] pays attention to characterize the UAV-to-ground channel with arbitrary three-dimensional (3D) UAV trajectories for UAV-based 6G networks. To do so, a 3D nonstationary geometry-based stochastic model is derived by using the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel configuration, with respect to distinctions between AV altitudes, spatial consistency, and 3D arbitrary UAV movement trajectories. Meanwhile, a collaborative multi-UAV trajectory optimization and resource scheduling framework is studied in [101] in a 6G-IoT network, where multiple UAVs are used as flying base stations to transfer energy to multiple terrestrial IoT users. The design is focused on the association between UAVs and users, by implementing a user association solution to select the most appropriate user to upload data to a specific UAV. Accordingly, the ultimate objective is to optimize the average achievable rate among all IoT users, with respect to the UAV trajectory, sub-slot duration, and user transmit power. A joint algorithm based on the relaxation and successive convex optimization methods is derived to solve the proposed problem, showing a better achievable rate compared to existing schemes. Similarly, the research in [102] concentrates on optimizing the transmission rates of UAVs, where UAVs act as mobile relays in NOMA-based cognitive 6G-IoT networks. A flexible approach is adopted that allows for optimally selecting relays to provide higher transmission rates under fixed power.",

To accommodate the federated data training in the UAV network with limited batteries and bandwidth spectrum, a resource allocation problem is considered that is then solved by a DRL algorithm. In the future, to facilitate operations of UAVs in 6G-IoT networks, regulations should be put into place to provide guidelines for the deployment of UAVs in IoT systems, to ensure safety and privacy [106] . Moreover, local licensing regulations are also important, especially when countries are still in the process of defining rules for spectrum access rights to UAV manufacturers. Regulatory authorities should collaborate to address critical issues in UAV integration into the existing IoT networks, from pricing strategies to network deployment choices, interference protection and aerial service coordination.",

            "text": "In the 6G era, it is highly essential to integrate satellite communications into current wireless networks for massive IoT coverage which gives birth a new domain called SIoT [107] , [108] . Conceptually, satellites consist of three main network tiers, namely LEO, MEO, and GEO to offer global services to the terrestrial IoT users. Compared to MEO and LEO, the LEO system has been received priorities in 5Gnetwork generation research due to its lower orbit height and useful features to support IoT connectivity, such as shorter transmission delay, smaller path loss. However, in the 6G era, thanks to the advanced satellite technologies, multiple satellites can be deployed at dozens of orbits above the earth, LEO systems can thus authentically realize the global coverage and more efficiency by frequency reuse. Moreover, it is envisioned to establish inter-satellite links to enable inter-satellite communications based on THz bands, which can accommodate more satellites and achieve higher link performances due to its much wider bandwidth, compared to existing spectrum resources in mmWave communication and optical communication counterparts in the 5G era [107] . As a case study in SIoT, the work in [109] focuses on research of a LEO satellite network that can support the navigation of UAV trajectories for IoT data collection missions. A twomode communication model is derived, i.e., the UAV carrystore mode and the satellite network relay mode for IoT data transmission. In this context, a UAV energy cost optimization problem is formulated that is then solved by a column generation based algorithm. To provide further insights into SIoT, the authors in [110] build a comprehensive model along with highlighting technical discussions and challenges; this includes satellite base stations and a network of terrestrial users where satellite communications can be realized via relays located at terrestrial base stations. Satellite communications can be integrated with the RIS technology to enhance transmit power consumption at the satellites, as shown in [111] ; thus, a RIS-assisted LEO satellite framework is created. RIS units can be set up on the rectenna arrays to support IoT data broadcasting and beamforming based on transmit features such as carrier frequencies. In line with the energy discussion, an energy-aware massive random access scheme for satellite communications in 6G-enabled global SIoT is considered in [112] . In reality, to communicate to the base station via the uplinks, each IoT device needs to create a random access process, by selecting an available preamble from the provided preamble set for data transmission. Accordingly, an enhanced preamble sequence scheme is proposed to perform one-step fractional timing advance estimation to avoid additional signalling overhead and energy costs. Simulation results confirm a high performance in terms of an increase of up to 15% in timing estimation accuracy compared to existing approaches.",

This is based on that fact that NOMA is able to enhance the spectrum efficiency by enabling users to transmit on the same carrier and classifying users by different power levels. Furthermore, the cognitive radio facilitates dynamic spectrum sharing for efficient spectrum usage. Towards a trade-off between system flexibility, network performance, latency and energy management in 6G-based SIoT networks, a holistic architecture is provided in [114] with different useful applied domains, as illustrated in Fig. 9 . For instance, SIoT is flexible to offer remote connectivity where terrestrial networks are overloaded or not possible, like seas and deserts. Further, it is possible to provide data services, such as data offloading and caching to support service delivery for terrestrial base stations with billions of connected users.

The study in [116] investigates the potential of ML-based CNNs in optimizing resource allocation in massive IIoT systems with 6G through a multi-agent system. Due to the limited resource of IIoT sensors, the deployment of sensor nodes is often implemented randomly, introducing unnecessary energy costs. CNNs are useful to perform intelligent sensor clustering via data mining and predictions based on neural backpropagation and interaction in the training process with historical datasets. Numerical simulation verifies a better resource allocation with lower power consumption and reduced complexity. Meanwhile, transfer learning is adopted in [117] to coordinate the data distribution and transmission in a blockchain-based 6G IIoT network, where blockchain is integrated into edge nodes and a cloud server for building a secure data sharing platform. An integrated fog-cloud computing model is integrated to handle the data analytics and blockchain data, by taking the block size, CPU and memory usage, and network delays into account. The reasoning ability of ML is exploited in [118] for dealing with fault detection and fault prediction problems in 6G-based IIoT systems with industrial sensors and actuators. To this end, a long short-term memory network with a DNN is integrated to perform online fault prediction in a mini manufacturing system, aiming to optimize plant operations and accelerate the production process. Online learning enabled by data-driven ML is also helpful to 6G-based IIoT network operation interpretation thanks to the reasoning ability of the deep neural structures [119] . This is particularly important for future 6G-IIoT applications where data volumes are extremely large and its architecture is highly complex which can be explained via data learning.",

However, the integration of 6G into IoT networks may be vulnerable to threats related to wireless interface attacks such as unauthorized access to data at computing units/servers, threats to integrity in the access network infrastructure, and denial of service (DoS) to software and data centres [125] . For example, the diversity of IoT devices and access mechanisms as well as massive device connectivity in large-scale IoT access networks brings new security challenges as handovers between different access technologies increase the risk of attacks. The growth of connections between devices and computing nodes at the network edge also increases the security and privacy threats, where eavesdropping attacks, hijacking attacks, spoofing attacks and DoS attacks may occur in data communications and data management centres. Additionally, to realize intelligent 6G-IoT networks, AI functions can be deployed at distributed edge nodes, where the data training can be manipulated in a spectrum access system by inserting fake signals or modified parameters. Thus, a malicious attack can illegally take advantage of a large portion of spectrum by denying the spectrum to other users. Attackers can also exploit the distributed data training nature and the dependencies on edge computing to launch different attacks such as malicious data injection, data poisoning or spoofing that adversely affect the training outputs of AI functions in intelligent 6G-IoT systems. Also, edge intelligence can face security vulnerabilities due to the distribution of AI functions at the network edge, where attacks can deploy data breaches or modifications while the management of remote 6G core network controllers is limited [126] . Moreover, the deployment of satellite-UAV-IoT communications over the untrusted environments in space can be hindered by data privacy leakage caused by third-parties and adversaries during the data exchange and transmission between satellite base stations, UAVs, and terrestrial IoT users.",

For example, perturbation techniques [127] such as differential privacy or dummy can be used to protect training datasets against data breaches in the edge intelligence-based 6G-IoT networks, by constructing composition theorems with complex mathematical solutions [128] . As an example, differential privacy is applied in [129] by inserting artificial noise (e.g., Gaussian noise) to the gradients of NN layers to preserve training data and hidden personal information against external threats while guaranteeing convergence. A novel privacypreserving data aggregation solution is also integrated under fog computing architecture to satisfy differential privacy in the fashion that the aggregation results are close to the actual results while adversaries cannot extract the ground truth in the exchanged gradients. A Reference Energy Disaggregation dataset including specific information about the electricity consumption of households and a healthcare dataset including more than 1 million medical records are employed for simulations. Implementation results demonstrate that differential privacy helps achieve an up to 6% higher data protection degree, compared to traditional Laplace differential privacy approaches, under various privacy budget settings. However, the application of differential privacy also comes with the cost of training quality degradation. In future work, it is suggested to develop accuracy-aware differential privacy designs to strike the trade-off between training quality and privacy protection. Moreover, blockchain is a promising solution to build trust and establish secure decentralized communications for UAV-IoT networks [130] . Each UAV can act as a blockchain node to perform decentralized data sharing and communications, where lightweight mining mechanisms should be also designed for low-latency data consensus with respect to the resource constraints of flying devices like UAVs. This blockchain technique becomes more important in the 6G era since IoT networks tend to be decentralized and deployed over the large scale that is well suitable for the decentralization feature of blockchain.",

The data communications and service delivery services, e.g., vehicular data sharing in autonomous driving, packet delivery in the space with UAV communications, requires significant energy resources to ensure the network operations. Besides, each base station in wireless cellular networks normally consumes 2.5 kW to 4 kW [131] , which means that the deployment of massive 6G-IoT networks with thousands of stations results in enormous energy consumption that also increases carbon emissions. Designing energy-efficient communication protocols via optimization is desired to realize green 6G-IoT networks. For example, the work in [132] jointly optimizes the QoS and energy consumption in 6G-based smart automation systems. This can be done by implementing a 6G-driven multimedia data structure model with respect to QoS parameters, such as packet loss ratio and average transfer delay during energy-efficient multimedia transmission.",

            "text": "The hardware constraint of IoT devices is another possible challenge in communications and computations 6Gbased IoT networks. For example, in intelligent 6G-based healthcare, wearable sensors and mobile devices should be able to simultaneously run AI functions to achieve edge intelligence and implement data transmission with URLLC. Due to the constraints of hardware, memory, and power resources, certain IoT sensors cannot meet the corresponding computational requirements [135] . The data exchange between IoT sensors and the network server also incurs communication overhead which scales up with the task sizes. Thus, new hardware design is needed toward future smart and powerful IoT devices. For instance, the work in [136] introduces a software-based DL accelerator to support data training on mobile sensor hardware. The key idea is to use a set of heterogeneous processors (e.g., GPUs) where each computing unit exploits distinct computational resources for processing different inference phases of DL models. This aims to optimize hardware usage for data training without compromising the accuracy performances, enabled by two algorithms, i.e., runtime layer compression and deep architecture decomposition. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed approach in terms of low execution time and energy consumption in AI hardware running, compared to cloud offloading-based approaches. This research is promising to develop mobile AI inference for edge intelligence, which would enable on-device IoT implementation in the future wireless networks. Moreover, a scheme called Tiny-transfer learning (TinyTL) is considered in [137] for memory-efficient on-device sensor learning. To compensate for the capacity loss, a memory-efficient bias module, called lite residual module is integrated which enhances the model capacity by refining the intermediate feature maps of the feature extractor with a minimal memory overhead. Numerical simulations are implemented using image classification datasets, showing that the proposed on-device learning approach can achieve a competitive accuracy performance (above 90%), compared to the traditional training solutions (e.g., Inception-V3), while reducing the training memory footprint by up to 12.9. More research efforts are needed to provide hardware-based AI training solutions on nano IoT devices and embedded wearables in future intelligent 6G IoT networks, such as intelligentenhanced living assistance services.",

            "text": "The emergence of 6G technologies potentially transforms the shape of IoT markets and revolutionizes the IoT ecosystems with advanced wireless networking features. However, the development of 6G-IoT systems requires stringent standard specifications that calls the collaboration of all business stakeholders such as network operators, services providers, and customers [138] . The lack of system standards can hinder the deployment of 6G functions and technologies in customer IoT systems. Moreover, the introduction of vertical 6G-IoT use cases in future intelligent networks imposes major architectural changes to current mobile networks in order to simultaneously support a diverse variety of stringent requirements (e.g. autonomous driving, e-healthcare, etc.) In such a context, network standards hold an important role in deploying 6G-IoT ecosystems at large-scale due to the reliance of other important services such as computing and 6G server-IoT device communication protocols. A popular protocol is MODBUS [139] which is the communication standard for connectivity of computer servers, industrial electronic equipments, and sensor devices in IoT environments. MODBUS is developed based on a variety of enabling protocols such as remote terminal unit (RTU), TCP/IP, and UDP. It relies on mesh networking architectures and can provide industrial communications with the supervisory control over the industrial radio bands. Recently, the Industry Specification Group of the European Telecommunications Standards Institute has released the initiative called ETSI Multi-access Edge Computing [140] , which aims to leverage seamlessly edge computing and communication frameworks for integrating various edge-based IoT applications originating from the vendors and service providers in the next-generation wireless networks. This would facilitate various IoT services such as video analytics, augmented reality, data caching, and content delivery. In the near future, the interested stakeholders should pay more attention to develop new standard specifications for new space-air-ground-underwater communications, e.g., new IoT satellite IoT communications, which would be significant to the future deployment of new commercial IoT applications such as space travel and deep sea marine services. The summary of challenges and potential directions in 6G-IoT research is presented in Table VI. VI. CONCLUSIONS 6G has recently sparked much interest in both industry and academia due to its appealing features compared to previous generations of wireless networks. In this article, we have explored the opportunities brought by the 6G technologies to support IoT networks through a holistic survey based on the emerging study activities in the field. This work is motivated by the lack of a comprehensive survey on the use of 6G for IoT. To bridge this gap, we have first introduced the recent Security and Privacy in 6G-IoT",
