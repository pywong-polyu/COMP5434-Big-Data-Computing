A comparative analysis of four regions revealed that the implementation of pandemic plans was affected by multiple factors. For instance, some planning was outdated and insufficient to cope with the new threat posed by the pandemic; due to a decentralized health care system, there was confusion about whether regional or national decision-making was the coordinating actor; shortages in supplies and equipment such as masks, in some regions, were due to lack of implementation of existing pandemic plans. The study emphasizes the importance of a coordinated response to crises.",

Most health care systems faced severe capacity overloads, and significant losses of lives followed where the outbreaks occurred.

First, it affects multiple policy domains; not merely one sector of government activities. Second, the crisis developed rapidly, and national governments had to respond and design measures under unprecedented time pressure. Third, it was very difficult to comprehend what was happening in the initial stages of the COVID-19 outbreak, as it originated in a faraway country and the causes and origins of the outbreak were unknown and contested for a long time. Fourth, the COVID-19 crisis posed huge challenges to the existing bureaucratic and political system, and multiple actors at different levels of government, regarding accountability and responsibility. Fifth, no ready-made, easily applicable solution to the COVID-19 emergency was immediately available to policymakers. In Italy, the crisis proved extremely demanding for its unpredictably pervasive impact on multiple organizational domains on one hand, and due to its uniqueness and complexity on the other.",

This section presents both approaches, given the interconnectedness of policy making with institutional determinants. However, this paper leans towards the governance approach, with a focus on policy instruments implemented by regional governments for contingency planning. Policy capacity has been defined as the government's ability to conduct an array of policy-related functions, pertinent to three distinct domains (Wu et al., 2015) : the capacity to understand the policy environment, to identify critical actors and assets, and to provide strategic guidance. With the novel COVID-19, obtaining a quick grasp of the situation turned into an insurmountable endeavor due to the rapid escalation of the numbers of people infected, the medical conditions in lethal cases, and the initial epidemiological patterns of contagion. Although national and regional pandemic plans were in place, as discussed later, entire governance systems were overwhelmed by the pandemic.",

The decentralized structure of health care governance in Italy is thus particularly relevant (Saltman et al., 2007) . Bringing together disparate organizations at central and subnational levels to engage in coherent and joint action during a transboundary crisis is particularly challenging in analogous systems. Coordination is defined as \"adjustment of actions and decisions among interdependent actors to achieve a specific goal\" (Koop & Lodge, 2014) and is considered a mechanism for governments to manage \"wicked\" policy problems. Ansell suggested that in large-scale transboundary crises, coordination among actors may present a significant challenge. The larger the scale of the crisis, the higher the number of actors involved; hence, it becomes increasingly difficult to decide, unanimously, which public authority is to lead the coordination effort through accepted enforcement mechanisms (Ansell et al., 2010) . The inability to match the organizational structure of intervention with the multiple dimensions of the crisis creates policy underlaps, where two or more authorities sharing different degrees of competence over the same domain expect the other to intervene. As neither actor can clearly frame its own responsibility in the context of the emergency, intervention may be foregone, delayed, or enfeebled. In the Italian system, responsibility for containment measures are devolved to regional governments, although occasions for centralized intervention are envisioned in preventive pandemic plans.",

Horizontal coordination with other policy subsystems and interdependence between parallel, dispersed, and unrelated policy domains in pursuit of a common policy Fig. 1 Bars represent regional total cases in thousands; the line represents the compounded distribution of total cases from most to least affected regions. Source Ministero della Salute & Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 (2020) outcome has been emphasized as a pervasive element of policy achievement. This is customarily defined as \"policy integration\" (Giessen, 2011a, b) . The fundamental logic underlying policy integration is that cooperation among actors with different policies more effectively delivers the intended outcome than exclusively sectorial policymaking can. Unilateral policymaking, on the contrary, has the potential to undermine the objectives of parallel policy domains (Tosun & Lang, 2017) . Hence, the context of the pandemic required intensely harmonized interventions between multiple sectors. For instance, the business sector was forced to adopt smart-working and flexible arrangements, even if such measures are normatively the exclusive domain of health care policy. The Ministry of Education in Italy, for example, urged the adoption of measures to suspend schooling and examinations. Furthermore, public transport authorities structurally revised their local delivery systems. By no means does policy integration necessarily facilitate the pursuit of joint policy objectives: the pursuit of policy integration requires coordinated institutional infrastructure to align the contributions of distinct domains. In a strongly decentralized system, however, the lack of overarching coordinating authorities has the potential to undermine cross-sector integration. Vertical coordination and policy integration are critical theoretical categories to analyze the COVID-19 early responses in Italy and are recognized as key variables for effective management (OECD, 2020).",

Primarily, sensemaking activities allow public authorities to understand the crisis, assess its magnitude, and deliver acceptable early-policy intervention (Boin et al., 2016) . Sensemaking leads to decision-making strategies, based on the degree of threat, time urgency, and anticipation perceived by actors (Hermann & Dayton, 2009) .

            "text": "Building a credible narrative for public opinion during transboundary crises is exceptionally problematic: \"In fact, the rising number of actors increases the chances of contradicting messages, which may heighten fear and hamper cooperation\" (Ansell et al., 2010, p. 200) . Arguably, the relationship between coordination capacity and sensemaking is ambivalent: sense-making influenced coordination capacity by facilitating or harnessing early interventions and preparedness to manage the COVID-19 emergency. Therefore, the less adequate sensemaking is, the more likely the crisis will spiral out of control (Weick, 1988) . Conversely, the degree of coordination within governance systems may enhance or deter a cohesive understanding of the crisis, depending on how multiple flows of information are channeled and filtered. The operational mechanisms that underpin the governance system during stable conditions, however, are completely undermined in the context of unprecedented crises (Ansell et al., 2010) . The contingency plans created in the aftermath of the SARS virus in 2002, notably the regional pandemic plans that are analyzed in \"Context: Italy\" section, were never implemented in Italy. To gather political consensus, governments ought to create a compelling narrative and reassure citizens that public authorities are taking effective action to deal with the emergency. This typically requires a communication strategy to restore public trust and justify bureaucratic behavior. This point is emphasized in all regional pandemic plans. However, government detractors can undermine its political support, forcing governments to assume a defensive stance vis-\u00e0-vis aggressive criticism by media, political adversaries, and antagonist organizations. Failure to maintain legitimacy can result in political punishment, weakened reciprocity between actors or multiple levels of governance, hampered coordination, or any combination of these three outcomes.",

Literature suggests that since vertical and horizontal relations (institutional coordination and policy integration, respectively) among policy actors tend to favor formalized procedure rather than policymaking practice (Tosun & Lang, 2017) , the level of operational and organizational compliance with the formulated pandemic plans is presumed to reflect intervention coherence, and the adequacy of pre-existing crisis coping mechanisms.",

Its major objective was to identify, and issue early warnings of new cases of flu viruses, in order to take quick action at the start of the pandemic. The Ministry of Health takes responsibility for the policy coordination of all government actions to fight against pandemics. One of the key principles to improve policy capacity, according to the 2005 Plan, is to effectively coordinate all policy responses at national and regional levels. It provides, for instance, a comprehensive roadmap on what to do during Stage 1, identified as the \"preparation and crisis prevention stage\" before pandemics emerge. It calls for the improvement of preparation mechanisms, such as mapping hospital beds, ventilators, disinfection plans, stockpiling of personal protective equipment (PPE), analyzing triage arrangements and the possible movement of patients between health care organizations. It emphasizes the need to train a health care workforce, and personnel. The 2005 Plan provides clear and detailed guidelines on how to design and implement regional pandemic plans.

Regions in the North were severely affected and suffered most infections and deaths registered in the country (ISTAT, 2020). Lombardy was overwhelmed by COVID-19 cases during the first wave, unlike other regions in the North (Veneto, for instance). The South was significantly less affected during the first wave. As regions in Italy share formal and legal responsibilities for pandemic prevention and control measures with the central government, coordination capacity is a criticality to jointly achieve the goals of protecting the population. Along the lines recommended by the NPP, first adopted in 2006, each regional government had to develop its own Regional Pandemic Plan (RPP) according to their demographic, socioeconomic conditions and health care organizational arrangements (Ministero della Salute, 2006). Regional governments acquired new responsibilities for crisis management and emergencies during the late 1990s. As the governance structure of the national Department for Civil protection changed from a centralized to a network and polycentric governance approach, regional governments, provinces, municipalities, and the voluntary sector became key stakeholders in crisis management. Regions were tasked with prevention and control functions during the pre-crisis contingency planning. In the field of crisis management, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the central state held the main coordination responsibility. The Department of National Civil Protection supports regions with stockpiling of pharmaceuticals, and PPE, providing additional health care workforce and new hospitals, as necessary. When the COVID-19 pandemic struck Northern Italy in January 2020, the most updated NPP was the one adopted in 2006. The 2006 National Plan was a response to the WHO's recommendation in 2005 to design pandemic plans in view of the SARS-2003 influenza. The Italian Ministry of Health designed comprehensive and detailed contingency planning instruments, indicating specific programs and actions of prevention and control that regional governments had to implement. An analysis of the NPP suggests that regional governments were given clear, specific guidelines on how to design local programs, which had to align with central national protocols. When the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in 2020, neither the National Plan nor the regional plans were used as governance tools. They were simply not activated nor used in the process of crisis management. The governance system was so overwhelmed by the pandemic that chaos and confusion reigned (Mattei & Del Pino, 2021) . The 2006 National Plan (the only one available in 2020) recommended regional governments to implement clear communication strategies with the population, to establish clear protocols for the procurement and use of PPE, to create and implement training schemes for health care workers; and to monitor the available resources (hospital beds, diagnostic technologies). The key characteristics of selected regional plans for these dimensions of the national contingency planning follow. The purpose of this section of the paper is to present the regional articulations and different interpretations of nationally coordinated and mandated contingency planning.",

With the emergence of COVID-19, the standard of contingency planning was subject to a further consolidation, and management efforts were intensely focused on communication activities. The contribution of key scientists as strategic policy advisors to the regional government was paramount to decision-making processes, also due to the foresighted assumption that asymptomatic carriers were primary vehicles of infection. Considering this, the Regional Government extended testing to the entire population, far exceeding the groups indicated by the national protocol.

In practice however, confusion about the virus hindered narrativeconstruction processes as late as the end of February 2020, when infections in the region were already rising exponentially. Furthermore, the pervasiveness of the contagion disrupted any development of a coherent governance system between different levels of government, causing vertical coordination underlaps between the regional government and the central state. Political conflict erupted between the President of the Lombardy Region, Mr. Attilio Fontana, and Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, as both levels claimed ownership of the local emergency, thus delaying the curtailment in two high-priority towns in the Bergamo province, Nembro and Alzano Lombardo. Since institutional provisions allow intervention by the region or the central state, no action was taken to contain the virus in those cities which were not isolated (Comitato Tecnico Scientifico, 2020). As infections proliferated and casualties surged in these areas, political leadership diverted their efforts toward blame-games (ANSA, 2020a).",

It is crucial to comprehend that Sardinia enjoys two fundamental geostrategic advantages. As an island in the Mediterranean, it constitutes an isolated region where the economy hinges on summertime tourism. Therefore, the scarce circulation of people in winter may have inhibited the contagion. Although its urbanized areas host most inhabitants, cities and towns are not closely connected, further ameliorating curtailment. For pre-crisis pandemic arrangements established by the RPP, authorities opted for a close mirroring of national recommendations, featuring most elements prescribed in the NPP. The reference to PPE is worthy of attention: their employment is exclusively for hospitalized patients and does not extend to the entire population. A divergence from the NPP lies in the absence of specialized provisions to train the health workforce, although this shortcoming persists in most regions. In addition, communication strategies are emphasized; the purpose is to achieve high levels of internal coordination between policy response actors, provide information, and build trust with the citizenry. COVID-19's impact in Sardinia was negligible, with a single spike of infections in late March at Sassari's hospital, Santissima Annunziata, which constituted more than two thirds of total regional cases: 875 solely in Sassari of 1366 in Sardinia (Regione Autonoma della Sardigna, 2020). Interestingly, according to health care specialists, the cluster in Sassari emerged due to insufficient organizational capacity, with a lack of protective equipment, specialized training, and asymptomatic testing (ANSA, 2020b). Although outside the timeframe of this paper's analysis, a further development of the Sardinian case ought to be advanced here, as the epidemiologic situation was completely reversed between July and August 2020. Since the relaxation of containment measures drew massive inflows of Italian and foreign tourists to the beaches, Sardinia became one of the main hubs for second-wave clusters in September.",

            "text": "An observation of early responses to COVID-19 in Italian regions is useful to study the relationship between contingency pre-crisis planning instruments and crisis-management. The literature on transboundary crises has emphasized the complexity of interdependence between different levels of government and groups of specialized actors operating in overlapping policy spaces, encouraging a comparison of response systems to the same crisis as an insightful tool to elucidate these issues (Ansell et al., 2010) . Similarly, the literature on crisis management stresses preparedness and preparation activities as mandatory functional tasks for public authorities during crises (Eriksson & McConnell, 2017; Hale et al., 2020; Weible et al., 2020) . The first wave of COVID-19 was an intense test of the Italian decentralized health care system, highlighting the non-linear relationship between formal pandemic plans and successful crisis management. The findings suggest that due to their fragmented institutional reach, highly decentralized systems, require additional effort to deliver an effective response strategy. Hence, ensuring policy alignment between different units of government and integrating actors from multiple policy sectors is essential to coordinate the collective crisis management effort. Preparedness planning aims to achieve that and prevent bad governance through the anticipation of administrative procedures, hierarchies, resources, and distribution of formal responsibilities. For Italy and its regions, such planning instruments were the NPP and the RPP's; carefully studied and presented in great detail in the empirical section of the paper.",

The unavailability of protective masks, the delayed containment measures, and absence thereof, in Nembro and Alzano in Lombardy, and the infection clusters in Sassari's hospital are all examples of inadequate and unsuccessful crisis management. Compliance with national directives and rigorous enactment of RPP's provisions, however, would have been only marginally effective: pandemic plans at neither level received updates after the H1N1 influenza virus (swine flu) in 2009, whilst the scope of COVID-19 far exceeded the need for capacity envisioned therein. Despite these limitations, the implementation (albeit partial) of these policy instruments would have contributed to the development of purpose and learning during the management of pandemic crises (Hillyard, 2000) . More research is necessary to understand the reasons for the lack of implementation of the regional pandemic plans in Italy, as some of them were very detailed, and rigorous.",

Given such marked differences, one could have predicted the further challenge to coordinated governance efforts in crisis management. Significantly, even where the RPP's provisions were put in place, and pre crisis contingency planning was adequate and strong, that did not necessarily translate into effective crisis management. This finding demonstrates the validity of Erikson and McConnell's argument on contingency planning (Eriksson & McConnell, 2017) . In all four regional cases, pre-crisis successful planning did not lead to effective crisis management. Most organizations failed to follow the legal mandates and the plans. The Lombardy Region was overwhelmed by the COVID-19 pandemic and all the preparations and anticipation mechanisms were not implemented quickly enough to save lives.",

Successful pre-crisis contingency plans can make no difference. It seems, in Italy some regional governments fared better by improvising and adapting to uncertain conditions, and crafting innovative policy instruments of their own. Veneto was more effective than other regions by violating the national statutory protocols on track and trace. Lazio's regional government too opted for this \"learn as you go\" approach, compensating for its poor pre-crisis planning mechanisms with ad-hoc legislation and intense horizontal policy integration with local health organizations. In this paper, we have not collected data with regards to sense-making and the perception of political and administrative elites, which possibly would have illuminated the process of strategic choices. Our analysis is not based on interviewing, due to the COVID-19 restrictions which impeded our direct on-site interviews and observations.",

            "text": "To conclude, Italy was the first European country to suffer from the impact of COVID-19 and may have been overconfident during the early stage of the crisis because its respective health systems ranked among the best worldwide (e.g., The Lancet Ranking), and Italy scored reasonably well in the Global Health Security Index (2019). The threat was also significantly downplayed in Italy until late February 2020. The empirical analysis conducted in this study indicates that some problems that arose during the crisis management of the pandemic could have been minimized if policy measures had been implemented rapidly and available policy instruments were used. Neither the general pandemic plans at the central government level, nor the existent preparedness plans for influenza and Ebola, anticipated the scope of an epidemic like COVID-19. However, they provided useful tools and protocols which were not implemented and completely ignored in many regions in Italy. Decentralized health care systems have advantages because they encourage innovation in regions that are trying to find solutions to the crisis and these answers can provide best practices, such as in Veneto in Italy. However, it is also likely that decentralized systems make coordination more complex. Central governments may be tempted to take on responsibility or avoid it. This happened in the case of Italy and made it difficult to be clear about who owns the crisis at the early stage, who should make the decisions and who should be punished or rewarded for it. The COVID-19 crisis has served as a learning experience about the limitations of pre-crisis planning and the role played by coordination capacity during crisis management. It has, nevertheless, helped to identify some aspects of pandemic management that require improvement. Future research is needed on the consequent pandemic waves, occurring in Italy from December 2020 and April 2021, in order to analyze the extent of policy learning from earlier experiences, and assess any changes to the coordination mechanisms here discussed in the paper.
