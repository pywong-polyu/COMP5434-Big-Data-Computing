Oral switch after initial intravenous antibiotic therapy may reduce costs and improve patients' discomfort without increasing unfavourable outcomes. We describe the methodology of two simultaneously conducted open-label randomised trials aiming to assess non-inferiority of oral switch as compared with entirely intravenous antibiotic therapy for the treatment of left-sided IE. Methods and analysis Two simultaneous multicentre open-label prospective randomised trials assessing noninferiority of oral switch during antibiotic treatment as compared with entirely intravenous therapy in patients with left-sided IE are ongoing. One trial is dedicated to left-sided IE caused by multisusceptible staphylococci (Relais Oral Dans le traitement des Endocardites \u00e0 staphylocoques ou streptOcoques (RODEO)-1) and the other is dedicated to left-sided IE caused by susceptible streptococci or enterococci . It is planned to randomise 324 patients in each trial after an initial course of at least 10 days of intravenous antibiotic therapy either to continue intravenous antibiotic therapy or to switch to oral antibiotic therapy. The primary outcome is treatment failure within 3 months after the end of antibiotic treatment, a composite outcome defined by all-cause death and/or symptomatic embolic events and/or unplanned valvular surgery and/or microbiological relapse (with the primary pathogen). Secondary outcomes include patient quality of life, echocardiographic outcome, costs and efficiency associated with IE care. Statistical analysis will be performed with a non-inferiority margin of 10% and a one-sided 2.5% type I error. Ethics and dissemination Written informed consent will be obtained from all participants. This study was approved by Tours Research ethics committee (CPP TOURS-Region Centre- Ouest 1, 2015 -R26, 23 February 2016 . Study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and disseminated through presentation at relevant national and international conferences. trial registration number EudraCT Number: 2015-002371-16 and NCT02701608; NCT02701595.",

[7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] A recent systematic review of oral therapy for the treatment of right-sided or left-sided IE found only one observational study reporting 80% cure rate with oral amoxicillin in 15 cases of streptococcal left-sided IE. 13 Two recent studies regarding the management of IE in France showed that a switch from intravenous to oral antibiotics is feasible when patients with left-sided Staphylococcus or Streptococcus IE are stable after an initial course of intravenous antibiotic treatment, with or without valvular surgery. 14 15 These practices have not been associated with unfavourable outcome, while significantly reducing the duration and cost of hospitalisation, the risk of nosocomial infection and patients' discomfort. A first randomised trial recently found non-inferiority of partial oral treatment as compared with continued intravenous antibiotic treatment in IE due to Gram-positive cocci whatever its species. 16 Other welldesigned randomised controlled trials are however needed to confirm the clinical non-inferiority of this strategy in IE due to most common bacteria (multisusceptible staphylococci, susceptible streptococci or enterococci), specifying for each group of species. Addressing these bacteria in two simultaneously performed trials would ensure an optimal recruitment, reduce cost of research and argue for/against oral switch in the majority of patients with IE. identified at the time they are hospitalised and receive intravenous antibiotic therapy for left-sided IE in one of the participating centres. Patients who meet selection criteria receive a brief study presentation and full participant information sheet by a clinician. After selection criteria confirmation and answering to patient questions about the trial, written informed consent is obtained. Baseline data are collected following consent.",

First, strict inclusion criteria resulted in a large number of exclusions among screened patients (1554 out of 1954). We expect that the broader inclusion criteria of the RODEO project will lead to better external validity of the results. Second, unlike the POET study, the oral treatment regimen in our study will be more homogeneous, and closely controlled as the investigational products will be provided and controlled by the trial sponsor. Another limitation in the POET study was the potential bias of merging staphylococci, streptococci, and enterococci for analysis. Indeed, S. aureus is regularly isolated as a risk factor for poor outcome in IE, 2 19 23 while IE due to streptococci with low MICs for amoxicillin could be treated with a short course of intravenous antibiotic treatment. 24 The RODEO trials will be the biggest multicentre randomised controlled trials to assess non-inferiority of oral switch of antibiotic therapy as compared with entirely intravenous antibiotic therapy in adult patients with leftsided IE due to Gram-positive cocci (staphylococci for RODEO 1, streptococci and enterococci for RODEO 2) .",

First, the homogeneity of treatment will be easier to interpret in each of the experimental arm. The combination therapy with rifampicin and quinolones has already been approved in other deep infections due to staphylococci. 25 26 For streptococcal IE, oral amoxicillin has been recommended with reassuring results. 8 13 Then, this is adapted to the French epidemiology of IE with a relative paucity of resistant bacteria. 2 23 Therefore, precaution will have to be taken in the extrapolation of the results, notably for IE due to staphylococci resistant to quinolones and enterococci, as MICs are frequently over 0.5 mg/L. 27 Then, we choose an evaluation of the primary outcome at 3 months after the end of the treatment as previous studies suggest that most of poor outcomes (mainly death related to IE) occur in the first 3 months after diagnosis, 23 and a shorter duration for the evaluation of the primary outcome is supposed to decrease the risk of lost to follow-up. The evaluation of a composite score of poor outcome at the end of follow-up is scheduled as a secondary objective. Finally, risk of bias linked with the absence of blinding for the primary outcome measure is attenuated by the use of an independent blinded EC.",
