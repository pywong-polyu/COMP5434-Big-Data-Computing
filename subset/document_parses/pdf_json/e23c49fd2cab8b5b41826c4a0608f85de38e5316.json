In this 3D model system, enteric infection can be mimicked using intraluminal microinjection by which pathogens and their metabolites can enter the host cell via the apical membrane. Figure 1A illustrates our experimental scheme in which we compare the consequence of microinjection-based apical infection versus the typical basolateral infection with matrigel.

For commercial re-use, please contact journals.permissions@oup.com As shown in Figure 1B , 3D gastric organoids exhibit a well-defined cell polarity as the apical membranes of gastric parietal cells (PCs), chief cells (CCs), and enterochromaffin-like (ECL) cells line up the lumen of gastric organoids (Supplementary Figure S1A and B). The apical polarity was also confirmed by F-actin labelling ( Figure 1B , top panel; enlarged montage a), while basolateral membrane was marked by b-catenin ( Figure 1B , bottom panel; enlarged montage a ). As depicted in Supplementary Figure S1A , PCs secrete hydrochloric acid and CCs are responsible for protease pepsin secretion. ECL cells secrete inflammatory factors such as histamine and IL2\u03b2 (Yao and Smolka, 2019) . Thus, the gastric epithelial lineage is well preserved in 3D organoids grown in vitro.",

In contrast, F-actin labelling was readily apparent in the apical membrane of the gastric lumen (arrowheads). Importantly, the basolateral distribution of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was also confirmed (Supplementary Figure S1D) . We next sought to inject engineered SARS-CoV-2 into gastric lumen and compare its infection efficiency with that of basolateral viral entry ( Figure 1C and D). As shown in Supplementary Figure S2A , microinjection of Alexa647-conjugated dextran resulted in an even distribution of the liquid into the lumen (lower right panel; blue color), suggesting the reliability of the technique. In order to eval-uate the efficiency of infection, we carried out electron microscopic analyses of organoids in which the samples were fixed 1 h after the microinjection followed by immune-gold labelling of spike protein. As shown in Supplementary Figure  S2B , microscopic analyses revealed an abundant deposition of 10-nm gold particles into the microvilli structure (arrows), indicating efficient entry into PCs 1 h after the injection, which is consistent with our hypothesis of primary viral infection via the apical membrane ( Figure 1D ). In contrast, no apparent gold particles were seen from basolateral infection (Supplementary Figure S2C ; arrows). The results of immuno-electron microscopic analyses were consist with that of the measurement of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Supplementary Figure S2D) . Thus, SARS-CoV-2 is an enteric virus that efficiently enters host epithelial cells via apical membranes.",

In contrast, basolateral infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the parallel experiments did not exhibit a significant stimulation (P > 0.05; n = 5), suggesting that enteric administration of SARS-CoV-2 is a much more efficient infection. Interestingly, the levels of IL-6 secretion did not change in response to either microinjection or infection of SARS-CoV-2, which is consistent with Note that IL-1\u03b2 secretion is responsive to enteric but not basolateral infection in acute infection.

To this end, we incubated 3D gastric organoids with the actin stabilizer phalloidin and the microtubule stabilizer taxol for 30 min before microinjection of SARS-CoV-2. We measured the cytokine levels 12 and 24 h after the microinjection. Importantly, the perturbation of actin cytoskeleton dynamics by treatment of organoids with phalloidin and the actin disruptor latrunculin inhibited the elevation of cytokine releases ( Figure 1F ), while treatment with the microtubule stabilizer taxol did not alter cytokine secretion in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection, indicating that the actin-based cytoskeleton is critical for primary entry (Supplementary Figure S3B) . Surprisingly, treatment with kinesin inhibitors, such as syntelin (Liu et al., 2020; Mullen et al., 2021) , inhibited CCL18 secretion from SARS-CoV-2-infected (24 h) but not microinjected organoids, suggesting that apical infection represents the primary entry whereas basolateral infection provides a secondary phase of viral Figure 1 (Continued) one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey's post hoc test was used to determine statistical significance. ***P < 0.001.

Based on the results of the current study, we offer a working model accounting for a potential mechanism for primary infection of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tracts and the lung ( Figure 1G ). Thus, the enteric infection model system established here would provide a valuable platform to screen targeted therapeutics for virus variants based on infectivity and host susceptibility. Systemic assessment of the spatiotemporal profile of cytokines secreted from organoids of SARS-CoV-2infected patients would help the rational design of targeted therapeutics for precision interrogation of disease disparity.
