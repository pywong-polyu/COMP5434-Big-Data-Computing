It provides an opportunity to explore the differences and similarities in stakeholder attitudes towards attraction management and reveals desired levels of participation of community in managing vandalism in tourism. This mixed method research employs community survey and interviews of site managers and government officials as its main data collection approach. It also offers an innovative approach to data analysis using the severity and optimist/pessimist psychographic variables coupled with quantitative analytical techniques. The results reveal complex relationship between psychographic profiles, future and current time dimensions, and location. In conclusion, the study offers several recommendations to city managers and policymakers on methods of vandalism control. It also highlights the importance of cultural context and its influence on community involvement. While this study is limited to tourism attractions, it provides a solid foundation for future research, one that can extend into urban planning and public policy design.",

            "text": "This study explores the perceptions and attitudes of key stakeholders and local community to vandalism in tourism sector. The key stakeholders are broadly identified as attraction management, i.e., site managers and local government officials responsible for policies and procedures that inform and guide visitor behaviour. The identified key stakeholders include individuals directly involved in site management. Direct involvement incorporates but is not limited to activities such as repair, maintenance, development of the infrastructure and civic amenities within and around the visitor attractions. In this study, local communities are identified as both residents and businesses within a one-kilometre radius of the tourist attractions being investigated. Tosun [1] states that local community can influence the development of tourist attractions and enable their success or failure within tourism industry. As such, local attitudes need to be considered in order to develop successful strategies to control property damage. Vandalism is a rather broad term encompassing a wide range of activities [2] . There is not one widely agreed upon definition of vandalism [3] . In fact, there is an argument that a general definition of vandalism is of limited use to researchers and a tailored definition might be more suitable [4] . In this context, vandalism is defined as acts of property damage that include graffiti, carving, litter, breakage, defacing, public property damage, private property damage, and environmental damage. This definition is a distillation of the responses, observations and findings offered by Martin [5] , Weinmayr [6] , Cohen [7] , Zeisel [8] , Goldstein [3] , and Bhati and Pearce [4, 9] . Here, public property damage is identified as damage to commercial facilities owned by local authorities (e.g., City Council), while private property damage is damage to private (privately owned) facilities.",

A more recent study identified several factors-namely fear, over-reaction and pessimism-that can influence tourists' perception of risk, thereby changing their behaviour and attitude towards a location [11] . Bae and Chang [12] and Bhati et al. [13] highlight different psychological and perceived risks as key factors in affecting travel behaviour, particularly future travel intentions. Drawing on the above research, this study employs optimist/pessimist psychographic variables and severity index to better assess the emotions of people that frequently interact with tourist attractions. Even though these interactions do not involve tourists but rather community and stakeholders, the study of the underlying dimensions of satisfaction even among multi-stakeholders may contribute to the understanding of attitudes towards a tourist attraction.",

Kattiyapornpong, Ditta-Apichai, Kanjanasilanon, and Siriyota [14] state that multi-stakeholders play a critical role in sustainable tourism development. Their participation facilitates the mutual benefits of all tourism stakeholders. The effective coordination in the context of multiple challenges faced by the tourism industry requires the involvement and cooperation from multi-stakeholders such as communities, enterprises, supporting industries, public sectors and local communities [15] . As such, there is a need to better understand local leaders', community and policy makers' perceptions toward tourism development as they act as the initiators in sustainable tourism planning [14, 16] . This study offers an analysis of the stakeholders' attitudes towards property damage as well as their involvement in addressing property damage issues at visitor attractions in the tropical settings of Bangkok and Singapore.

The study of multi-stakeholders' attitudes, perspectives, and opinions provides comprehensive information that can reinforce strategies adopted to develop sustainable practices in visitor behaviour management [19] . Noticeable degradation decreases the appeal of attractions which in turn affects tourist experience and satisfaction [20] . Significant vandalism could in time result in a reduction in tourist flows even to popular destinations such as Bangkok and Singapore. Vandalism can compromise the social welfare of the community, industry, and government.

Multi-stage cluster sampling has been used to identify individuals based on their ability to influence property damage, as well as individuals most affected by the outcomes of property damage. While property damage affects not only locals but also the wider community, the investigation is limited to the study of communities who can play a more direct role in attraction monitoring and management. The use of a one-kilometre radius suits the research needs and is a sensible solution when canvassing the public for opinions.",

Giving feedback also seems to be an important activity for Bangkok residents. Average mean values for both locations reveal that Bangkok respondents see community participation as more desirable or necessary compared to Singapore respondents who tend to be slightly more neutral. It is important to note that there are many types of behaviours and activities that can elicit a response. The questionnaires can offer only limited number of activities and the choice of activities is susceptible to researchers' bias. This must be acknowledged as a study limitation. The attitude towards 'supporting initiatives' seems to differ between the two locations. With Bangkok respondents, this particular option is considerably more popular (diff = 0.37, p < 0.001). Bangkok respondents also show a stronger preference towards involvement in community actions (diff = 0.65, p < 0.001) and require more local authority assistance (diff = 0.56, p < 0.001) compared to Singapore. While it is hard to definitively say why these differences occur, one could speculate that cultural differences between the respondents may have some influence over the results. Perhaps, Singaporeans more actively rely on the on-site management interventions rather than community interventions believing the former to be more effective, which could also explain their somewhat low enthusiasm for helping the site managers. This can be partially explained by the highly efficient manner of Singaporean public service sector [34] and well-developed law enforcement efforts [35] . Bangkok, on the other hand, generally shows a preference for community involvement [36, 37] . Thailand's public service is less efficient, so Bangkok community may see the need to involve both local authorities and community to facilitate positive change [38] . Looking into the future, it is advisable that urban planners and tourism officials take into consideration these peculiarities, creating more accountable structures and enabling stronger community links for the implementation of effective preventative strategies at tourist sites, specifically in environments where public participation is a strong factor in development initiatives.",
