            "text": "A global sentiment in early 2022 is that the COVID-19 virus could become endemic just like common cold flu viruses soon. The most optimistic view is that, with minimal precautions, such as vaccination, boosters and optional masking, life for most people will proceed as normal soon. However, as warned by A. Katzourakis of Oxford University recently [1], we must set aside lazy optimism, and must be realistic about the likely levels of death, disability and sickness that will be brought on by a 'COVID-19' endemic. Moreover, the world must also consider that continual circulation of the virus could give rise to new variants such as the new BA.2 variant (a subvariant of Omicron) continues to spread across the US and parts of Europe. Data from the CDC is already showing that BA.2 has been tripling in prevalence every two weeks [2] . Hence, globally, we must use available and proven weapons to continue to fight the COVID-19 viruses, i.e., effective vaccines, antiviral medications, diagnostic tests and stop an airborne virus transmission through social distancing, and mask wearing. For this work, we have demonstrated a smart mask with an optimally-coupled ultra-thin flexible soundwave sensors for tracking, classifying, and recognizing different respiratory activities, including breathing, speaking, and two-/tri-phase coughing; the mask's functionality can also be augmented in the future to monitor other human physiological signals. Although researchers have integrated sensors into masks to detect respiratory activities in the past, they only based on measuring temperature and air flow during coughing, i.e., counting only the number of coughs. However, coughing is a process consisting of several phases, including an explosion of the air with glottal opening producing some noise-like waveform, a decrease of airflow to decrease sound amplitude, and a voiced stage which is the interruption of the air flow due to the closure of glottal and periodical vibration of partly glottis, which is not always present. Therefore, sensors used for cough detection should not be only sensitive to subtle air pressure but also the high-frequency : medRxiv preprint",

Respiratory activities data from thirty-one (31) human subjects were collected. Machine learning methods such as Support Vector Machines and Convolutional Neural Networks were used to classify the collected sensor data from the smart mask, which show an overall macro-recall of about 93.88% for the three respiratory sounds among all 31 subjects. For individual subjects, the 31 human subjects have the average macro-recall of 95.23% (ranging from 90% to 100%) for these 3 respiratory activities. Our work bridges the technological gap between ultra-lightweight but high-frequency response sensor material fabrication, signal transduction and conditioning, and applying machining learning algorithms to demonstrate a reliable wearable device for potential applications in continual healthy monitoring of subjects with cough symptoms during the eventual COVID-19 endemic. The monitoring and analysis of cough sound should be highly beneficial for human health management. These health monitoring data could then be shared with doctors via cloud storage and transmission technique to help disease diagnosis more effectively. Also, communication barriers caused by wearing masks can be alleviated by combining with the speech recognition techniques. In general, this research helps to advance the wearable device technology for tracking respiratory activities, similar to an Apple Watch or a Fitbit smartwatch in tracking physical and physiological activities.",

Many countries lay down the laws requiring the use of masks [7, 8] , and wearing mask has become a daily necessity, even being part of people's social life. In fact, as recent as February 2022, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), USA, has published a study on the effectiveness of face mask or respirator use in indoor public settings for prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which indicates consistent use of a face mask or respirator in indoor public settings was associated with lower odds of a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result, i.e., the study found that there was a 66% lower odd for people wearing surgical masks and 83% lower odds for people wearing N95/KN95 respirator to test positive for COVID-19 than people who did not [9] .",

The most optimistic view is that, with minimal precautions, such as vaccination, boosters and optional masking, life for most people will proceed as normal soon. For example, some places are already planning for the endemic stage. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has asked European officials to discuss when COVID-19 should be considered endemic [10] , and California has adopted the USA's first endemic policy for COVID [11] , which emphasizes on the prevention and quick reaction to outbreaks instead mandated masking. However, as warned by A. Katzourakis of Oxford University recently [1] , we must set aside lazy optimism, and must be realistic about the likely levels of death, disability and sickness that will be brought on by a 'COVID-19' endemic. It is important to remember that endemic does not correspond to harmlessness. Malaria, for example, has become widely recognized in ancient Greece by the 4th century BC, but is still considered endemic in 87 countries worldwide as reported by CDC in 2021 [12] .",

Data from the CDC is already showing that BA.2 has been tripling in prevalence every two weeks [2] . Hence, globally, we must use available and proven weapons to continue to fight the COVID-19 viruses, i.e., effective vaccines, antiviral medications, diagnostic tests and stop an airborne virus transmission through social distancing, and mask wearing.",

As for coughing, researchers used integrated sensors detect the temperature change [18] and air flow [20] during coughing. These coughing detection sensors focus only on cough counting, the obtained information would be limited since coughing is a process consisting of several stages. Coughing initiated as a series of respiratory activities to cause a sudden explosion of air along with the cough sound which usually consists of three phases [35] [36] [37] [38] . The first stage is an explosive of the air with glottal opening producing some noise-like waveform, and then comes to the second steady stage when the airflow is decreased causing the sound amplitude is also decreasing. The third is the voiced stage which is the interruption of the air flow due to the closure of glottal and periodical vibration of partly glottis, which is not always presented [38] . Therefore, sensors used for cough detection should not be only sensitive to subtle air pressure but also the high frequency vibrations.",

The high-frequency signals, generated by vocal cord vibration [46] , provide perceptual information for individual speaker gender [47, 48] and contribute to speech intelligibility [49] , thus, wearing masks causes the dampening of high-frequency spectral energy which leads to decline in clarity of speech, bringing trouble to daily life. For example, mobile phone software that requires voice recognition cannot work properly in noisy environments when a person is wearing a mask, and the health monitoring related to the human voice will also be affected. Therefore, integrating a 'voice recorder' inside of the mask would be beneficial for speech recognition and understanding when wearing a face mask. What's more, human speech also provides health information and can help disease diagnose [50] [51] [52] .",

The 400\u03bcm thick sponge structure shows a static pressure sensitivity of about 0.85kPa -1 and responds to high-frequency dynamic pressure generated by human voice, i.e., sound harmonic energy up to 4000Hz. Air pressure caused by air movements consisting of air directional flow and air vibration can also be detected, and their typical features were investigated. We report here a smart mask by integrating flexible high-frequency response sensors on commercial masks to monitor human respiratory sounds (including breath, cough, and speech). Different characteristics of the three different respiratory activities were successfully captured. Thirty-one human subjects were recruited to collect the respiratory activity data of breath, cough, and speech. These data were further processed and classified by Support Vector Machines (SVM)/Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), which has an over macro-recall of about 91.43%/93.88% for the three respiratory sounds among all 31 subjects. For individual subjects, all the 31 human subjects have the macro recall above 90% (with the maximum as high as 100%) and the average reaches 95.23% for these 3 different types of sounds. Several applications could be developed using this smart mask. For example, as shown in Figure 1 , the important health related signals, respiratory rate (and further heart rate which is about 4 times of respiratory rate during rest) and cough can be recorded daily. As a typical respiratory disease symptom, cough is one of the commonest reasons for consultation with a doctor [53] . The monitoring and analysis of cough sound should be highly beneficial for human health management. These health monitoring data could then be shared with doctors via cloud storage and transmission technique to help disease diagnosis more effectively. Also, communication barriers caused by wearing masks can be alleviated by combining with the speech recognition techniques. In general, this research helps to advance the wearable device technology is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

For this work, we have demonstrated a smart mask with an optimally-coupled ultra-thin flexible soundwave sensors for tracking, classifying, and recognizing different respiratory activities, including breathing, speaking, and coughing; the mask's functionality can also be augmented in the future to monitor other human physiological signals.

Regarding the impedance properties, the changes in the phase angle (\u03b8) and total impedance (Z) of the CNT/PDMS sponge-based sensors at varying frequencies from 4 Hz-5 MHz are shown in Figure 3b , c. At relatively low frequencies, resistive behavior was dominant. The total impedance did not change with frequency, and the phase angle remains near zero. As the frequency increased, both the total impedance and phase angle changed. At high frequencies, the phase angle was no longer zero, indicating that the sponge had both the resistance component (i.e., the real component of Z) and the reactance component (i.e., the imaginary component of Z). Accordingly, the test frequency range could be delineated into resistive and capacitive regions, which respectively increased and decreased with increasing CNT concentration.

The sensors with 2wt% and 3wt% CNT content have the two typical different electrical properties. Therefore, the impedance response of the sponge-based sensor with 2wt% and 3wt% content to pressure were measured. In this study, different static pressures were applied using different weights and the measurement setup was shown in Figure 4a . The impedance parameters are dependent on the measurement frequency. To investigate the effects of measurement frequency on sensor sensitivity, impedance responses to different pressures were measured at different frequencies. The total impedance (Z) contains a real (resistance, Zre = Z*cos\u03b8) and imaginary component (reactance, Zim = Z*sin\u03b8). is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The sensitivity data of the different test conditions were presented in Table 2 . It is obvious that 3wt% CNT content sensor has higher sensitivity than that of 2wt%. It can be concluded that the sensor performs better when it behaves more like a resistor (with the CNT content of 3wt% or above), and the sensing mechanism is piezoresistive. The sensitivity should be about 0.9kPa -1 (the value of Zre sensitivity at 4Hz) when used in a DC circuit. Therefore, the sensor can be applied with a relatively simple measurement circuit (e.g., voltage divider circuit) and easily to be integrated with the MCU board which usually provide direct power supply. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

One is the air directional flow, where the air molecules flow in one direction without moving back and forth. The other is the air vibration, where the air molecules vibrate back and forth at some certain frequencies. The two pieces of electrodes of the sponge-based sensor was fixed to two separate pieces of glass with some distance to make the sensing area freestanding.

MAX4466 is a mature product which is integrated with the electret microphone. Our developed sponge-based sensor can be easily integrated with this amplifying module by replacing the electret microphone and worked well. The air directional flow pressure was provided by an air gun blowing air to the sensor with constant velocity, and the air vibration was induced by the speaker playing a 315Hz sound in front of the sensor, Figure 6b shows the illustrations.

The results show that the air directional flow caused a irregular output signal during the record time and no definite frequency component with most energy was in the low frequency range. On the contrary, the air vibration caused a stable and regular output signal and the FFT analysis suggested that the sensor captured the 315Hz sound signal correctly. The frequency components at multiple of 315 Hz (e.g., 630 Hz, 945 Hz, 1260 Hz, etc.) were the generated harmonics since it is not a perfect sin wave (the 50 Hz signal was the noise caused by the power supply). The output electric signal was then converted to audio signal using a self-developed Python program since sound is actually the air vibration. And more information can be obtained using audio formant. Figure 6e presents the audio waveform of air directional flow and air vibration, and Figure 6f is the corresponding spectrogram. The amplitude of air directional flow audio was irregular while the air vibration produced the periodical audio amplitude. The audio spectrogram is the short-time Fourier transform of the input audio and represents the signal strength, or \"loudness\", of a signal over time at various frequencies present the waveform which can also shows the energy levels vary over time. The spectrogram shows that the air directional flow mainly caused low frequency energy and vary with time. On the other hand, the energy of the air vibration caused signal focused on the 315 Hz and its harmonic frequencies (i.e., 630 Hz, 945 Hz, 1260 Hz\u2026). In addition, the energy at these frequency keeps stable over time which is an important feature that differentiates it air directional flow signal. Another parameter power spectral density (PSD) which represents the spectral energy distribution per unit time shows that the energy of air directional flow decreases steadily with frequency increasing while the air vibration presented several peaks (315*n Hz, n=1,2,3\u2026) over frequency (Figure 6g ). Harmonic to Noise Ratio (HNR) measures the ratio between periodic and non-periodic components of the audio. Figure 6h shows the HNR value of the air directional flow and air vibration. The former (i.e., air directional flow) has a negative HNR value since it has almost no periodic component, while air vibration has a positive HNR value as it is the periodic signal. In summary, the air directional flow and air vibration caused signals are different in the aspects of both the time domine and the frequency domine. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

The following analysis was based on the data acquired from the two methods. Figure 8a shows the data process flow, in which the recorded voltage change signals were converted to audio files first and the segmentation work was performed manually based on the visualized waveform and spectrogram (as shown Supplementary Figure S3 ). Fiftythree features (see Table1) , including HNR, PSD and etc, were extracted. The statistics for HNR value from the 31 subjects are shown in Figure 8b . The results suggest that speech has the highest and positive HNR value, which means most speech signals obtained were effective since they have the vibration features. The mean HNR value of breath is the lowest and negative because the breath signal has almost no periodical vibrations. As for the cough, its mean HNR value is between the speech and breath signals, which is reasonable because the first two phases of cough induced air flow while the third phase is voiced but not all coughs is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

The statistics for the data from thirty-one human subjects show consistency with the typical breath, cough, and speech signals in the main features, which suggests that our developed sponge-based smart mask has a good stability and robust performance. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to simplify and compute the principal components of the extracted features, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs) classification algorithm was then applied to recognize the three different respiratory activities. Firstly, the classification was performed on the data of the individual 31 subjects while each of them has an average of total 108 pieces of data of the breath, cough and speech signals. The macro-recall (arithmetic mean of recall value for all the classes) and recall of each class (breath, cough, and speech) based on the classification results were calculated. Figure 8c shows the mean value of the recall of 31 human subjects, in which the mean recall value for each class is above 94% (i.e., 95.23%, 94.18%, and 96.29% for breath, cough and speech respectively).

The whole process is shown in Figure 9a , MobileNet_v2 which consists of three convolutional layers, one pooling layer, seven bottleneck residual blocks and one fully connected layer was applied. Firstly, to obtain the same size of the input spectrograms, the segmented audio signals of different length was resampled and the spectrograms of the size of 256 (pixel) *256 (pixel) *3 (RGB channels) were generated. A random crop was then applied to modify the image shape to the MobileNet_v2 standard input size of 224*224*3. In the MobileNet_v2, convolutional layers apply a convolution operation to the input, then pass the calculation result to the next layer.

For the smart mask preparation, the sensor should be kept freestanding between the mask's inner surface and human face and fixed inside the mask for better detection which can also help effectively avoid the sound attenuation effect of the mask in high frequency region (i.e., above 1kHz). Experiments on human subject wearing this smart mask show that it can detect and differentiate three common respiratory activities including breath, cough, and speech. The breath signal was mainly due to the air directional flow, while cough signal included both air directional flow and air vibration (when the third voiced phase present). After converting these signals to audio sound, the audio corresponding to breath is a noisy sound since only air directional flow was induced without air vibration which cause meaningful sound. Cough sound can sometimes be heard in the third voiced phase because it would induce air vibration. It is suggested that not only the cough counting can be recorded but also the details of the cough signal can be obtained and analyzed using this smart mask. As for the speech, it was detected mainly due to the air vibration generated and so the corresponding audio can be clearly recognized.

Therefore, this smart mask has the great potential to help improving the speech intelligence which is degraded by the barrier of face mask. However, there are still some air flows which 'impact' on the sensor so the speech sounds to have some 'popping sound' that usually occurs when a speaker gets too close to a microphone. Applying a blowout hood may help reduce this popping noise and improve the audio quality.

The sensor performs well with the piezoresistive mechanism according to the electrical properties and sensitivity investigation which shows 0.85 kPa -1 and 0.11kPa -1 in the pressure range of 27.9Pa~0.2kPa and 0.2kPa~2.5kPa, respectively. The flexible sensor was also tested to detect the dynamic pressure of the frequency of 100~800Hz, which has a vibration sensitivity of about 3.48\u03a9/g. In addition, this flexible sensor has shown the ability to sense air movements including air directional flow and air vibration which have different characteristics (represented by features used in classification). That is, air directional flow caused relatively irregular signals and energy mainly focus on low frequency range, while air vibration caused periodical signal and energy focus on the vibration frequencies (fundamental frequency and the corresponding harmonics). These results show that the flexible sensor can be used to detect the human respiratory activities by integrating with a commercial polycarbonate mask. It was demonstrated that our developed 'smart mask' can detect and differentiate three common respiratory activities including breath, cough, and speech. The classification result of the three activities suggested an average macro-recall of about 95.23% (with individual dataset of 31 human subjects) and 93.88% (with a dataset containing all the 31 human subjects). We envision that the smart mask developed in this project could be enhanced by developing them into IoT devices based on encrypted Wi-Fi mesh technology, which will allow multiple nodes of masks to be distributed over a large social area and have the functions of self-organization and self-construction, and enable the masks to become multi-terminal, low power consumption, low cost, and high reliability IoT devices.

IPA was used as the solvent because both CNT and PDMS are partially soluble in it [54, 55]. The MWCNTs have diameters of 10-20 nm and lengths of 10-30 \u03bcm (provided by the manufacturer). First, MWCNTs were dispersed in a sufficient quantity of IPA and ultrasonicated for 20 min to obtain a dispersion of CNTs. Then, PDMS-A base was added into the dispersion and ultrasonication for 10 min. Subsequently, the mixture was placed on a hotplate (IKA, Germany) maintained at 55\u00b0C to completely evaporate the IPA. Thereafter, PDMS-B agent (the weight ratio of PDMS-A and PDMS-B is 10:1) was added to the solution and mechanically mixed. Finally, air bubbles were removed from the mixture through vacuum treatment. In this manner, CNT/PDMS composites with CNT concentrations of 2wt%, 2.5wt%, 3wt%, 4wt%, and 5wt% were prepared by mixing 0.2/0.25/0.3/0.4/0.5g of MWCNTs with 10g PDMS. Preparation of the CNT/PDMS sponge CNT/PDMS sponges were fabricated using sacrificial sugar cubes (Taikoo; purchased from a supermarket in Hong Kong) measuring 19.6 mm \u00d7 18.4 mm \u00d711.7 mm (thickness). The CNT/PDMS composite solution was dropped (with syringe) on to the surface of a sugar cube and spread smoothly across its surface. Then, a second sugar cube was placed atop the first cube and cured in an oven at 70\u00b0C for about 2h. Finally, the remaining",
