            "text": "The aim of the present study was to investigate the pharmacological mechanism of matrine in treatment of COVID-19 combined with liver injury. Potential targets related to matrine, COVID-19 and liver injury were identified from several databases. We constructed PPI network and screened the core targets according to the degree value. Then, GO and KEGG enrichment were carried out. Molecular docking technology was used to verify the affinity between matrine and the crystal structure of core target protein. Finally, real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the effects of matrine on hub gene expression in liver tissue of liver injury mice and lung tissue of lung injury mice to further confirm the results of network pharmacological analysis. The results show that six core targets including AKT1, TP53, TNF, IL6, BCL2L1 and ATM were identified. The potential therapeutic mechanism of matrine on COVID-19 combined with liver injury is closely related to regulate antiviral process, improve immune system and regulate the level of inflammatory factors. Molecular docking showed that matrine could spontaneously bind to the receptor protein and had strong binding force. Real-time RT-PCR demonstrated that matrine could significantly reduce the expression of AKT1, TP53, TNF, IL6 and ATM in mice with liver injury or lung injury (P < 0.05), and increase the expression of BCL2L1 to a certain extent (P > 0.05). Our results indicate that matrine can achieve simultaneous intervention of COVID-19 combined with liver injury by multi-dimensional pharmacological mechanism.",

Chen et al. found that among 99 patients with COVID-19, 43 patients had different degrees of liver function injury . Clinical data from the Fifth Medical Center of PLS General Hospital, Beijing, China shows that 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 had liver complications, while 14-53% of patients reported abnormal levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase [AST] during disease progression, and patients with severe COVID-19 appear to have a higher rate of abnormal liver function . In a study by Huang et al. , the elevation of AST was observed in eight of 13 patients [62%] in the intensive care unit [ICU] compared with seven of 28 patients [25%] who did not require care in the ICU . About 2-10% of COVID-19 patients have diarrhea symptoms, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in stool and blood samples (Yeo et al., 2020) . This evidence suggests that the liver may be infected with the virus. In view of this situation, 'The protocol for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of liver injury in coronavirus disease 2019' was formulated by China Digestion Association of Chinese Medical Doctor Association and Chinese Society of Hepatology of Chinese Medical Association (China Digestion Association of Chinese Medical Doctor Association, 2020). What's more, for severe patients with COVID-19 and previous severe liver disease, especially elderly patients with comorbidities, more targeted treatment is needed. Therefore, it is of great significance to develop effective drugs for the treatment of comorbidities.",

Matrine is an ancillary drug used clinically to protect liver function and treat tumors in China (Wan et al., 2009) . Remarkably, matrine played an important role in the fight against COVID-19. vivo animal experiments showed that matrine could reduce the pathological damage of lung tissue in COVID-19 model mice, reduce the lung index, the contents of IL-6, IL-10, TNF-a, and viral load in lung tissue, and increase the percentage of peripheral blood lymphocytes, thus enhancing the immune capacity of the body. Yang et al. found that matrine can shorten the nucleic acid negative turning time of patients with COVID-19 significantly.",

Swiss Target Prediction and the TargetNet web server are widely used in the research of Chinese medicine mechanisms and potential therapeutic targets (Yao et al., 2016; Daina et al., 2019) . The prediction of the potential targets of matrine was performed by SWISS and TargetNet based on the chemical similarities and QSAR model. SymMap database provides massive descriptive information on herbs, TCM symptoms, MM symptoms, ingredients, targets, and diseases (Wu et al., 2019) .

PubChem database (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) was used to download the two-dimensional (2D) structures of matrine. The 2D structure was saved in mol2 format as docking ligands, and energy minimize was carried out to get reasonable conformations using default parameters of SYBYL-X 2.1.1. All the atoms in the target protein were protonated by setting Koll man-all atom charges. Finally, the protein structure was optimized by energy minimization by incorporating the Tripos force field (Clark et al., 1989) . The docking was carried out by employing the Surflex dock module of licensed software SYBYL-X 2.1.1. The default values are set to blot (1.0) and threshold (0.5). The ligands were automatically docked into the binding sites, presenting an empirical scoring function (Malathi et al., 2016; Thillainayagam et al., 2019) . The stable conformation of low energy between ligand and receptor indicates that there is a great possibility of interaction between them. Generally, binding energy \u00c05 kJ/mol is used as the screening standard. In this Surflex dock, The best-docked ligand pose was identified by considering the Total Score (T-score), which is converted into the binding free energy (formula DG 0 \u00bc \u00c0 2.303 RT \u00c2 total score, where R is the ideal gas constant of molecule and t is the thermodynamic temperature of an ideal gas).",

            "text": "Matrine, as a clinical drug for liver function protection approved by China, has played an important role in this COVID-19 epidemic. Recent animal experiments confirmed that matrine can significantly reduce the pathological damage of lung tissue in model mice, and the inhibition rate of lung index can reach 86.86% . The clinical study of matrine sodium chloride injection for COVID-19 patients showed that the effective rate of 40 cases was 100% . The results of this study showed that there were 9 intersection targets among matrine, COVID-19, and liver injury, but proteins in the human body did not exist independently, and there was the interaction between proteins. To identify functional connections between the predicted target proteins, we construct a PPI network to predict protein-protein interactions and identified six core targets according to the degree value, namely AKT1, TP53, TNF, IL6, BCL2L1, and ATM. In this study, GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathways enrichment analysis were carried out in order to explore the multi-dimensional pharmacological mechanism of matrine on COVID-19 combined with liver injury. We analyzed the pathway with more annotation genes and a lower p-value: among these pathways, HTLV-I infection, Hepatitis B, and Human cytomegalovirus infection are mainly associated with Viral infectious diseases. According to this, we infer that matrine may have a broad-spectrum antiviral effect; While Transcriptional misregulation in cancers, Pancreatic cancer, Chronic myeloid leukemia, Small cell lung cancer, Platinum drug resistance, and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance is mainly related to the drug resistance mechanism of cancer and anticancer targeted drugs. These pathways are not closely related to the study of matrine against COVID-19 combined with liver injury; the C-type lectin receptor signaling pathway and Toll-like receptor signaling pathway are related to the Immune system, which are the two pathways that we pay more attention to. Because relevant studies have shown that sars-cov-2 infection can activate human immune cells, resulting in excessive aggregation of immune cells, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and then lead to lung, liver, and other organ damage (Xu, Shi, et al., 2020) . Therefore, it is speculated that 'cytokine storm' is one of the important causes of liver injury in patients with COVID-19; Furthermore, PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, NFkappa B signaling pathway, and p53 signaling pathway are also worthy of attention. PI3K-Akt mediated NF-kappa B is a classic inflammatory signal transduction pathway, which plays an important role in regulating the level of inflammatory factors in vivo. Once PI3K-Akt signaling pathway is activated, NF-kappa B can produce a large number of inflammatory factors and aggravate the inflammatory reaction. These pathways may inhibit the excessive release of related inflammatory cytokines, so as to avoid exacerbation of patients with COVID-19 combined with liver injury due to cytokine storm. Protein 53 (p53) is an important transcription factor that is involved in the regulation of mitochondrial apoptosis. Evidence also shows that p53 protein accumulates in patients with various inflammatory liver diseases (Dibra et al., 2016; Akyol et al., 1999) . p53 signaling pathway is mainly associated with cell growth and death. Inhibition of p53 signaling pathway can improve ethanol-induced hepatocyte injury by regulating the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway, and thus become an effective therapeutic strategy for treating liver injury (Yuan et al., 2020) . Meanwhile, evidence showed that p53 signaling pathway plays an important role in inducing apoptosis and antivirus by regulating the synthesis of cell cycle-related proteins (Peng et al., 2020) . Then, molecular docking technology was used to verify the binding of six core targets with matrine. The results showed that the binding free energy of matrine with the core target was less than \u00c05 kJ/mol, which indicated that the ligand molecule could spontaneously bind to the receptor protein and had a strong binding force. Finally, to further confirm the results of network pharmacological analysis, real-time RT-PCR was used to detect the effects of matrine on AKT1, TP53, TNF, IL6, BCL2L1, and ATM gene expression in liver tissue of liver injury mice and lung tissue of lung injury mice. The validation experiments demonstrated that MSCI could significantly reduce the expression of AKT1, TP53, TNF, IL6, and ATM in mice with liver injury or lung injury (p < .05), and increase the expression of BCL2L1 to a certain extent (p > .05), which confirmed the rationality of network pharmacology analysis results together with the molecular docking experiment.",

Matrine can inhibit cytokine storm, maintain liver function homeostasis, regulate immunity, antivirus, and other functions through direct target action and signal pathway regulation, which embodies the characteristics of overall regulation, network regulation, and interaction. Furthermore, as an important adjuvant therapy, traditional Chinese medicine components, such as matrine, combined with modern medicine approaches would benefit patients with COVID-19, especially patients with liver injury complications, and help to overcome the current COVID-19 pandemic.",
