The coronavirus belongs to the coronaviridae family . Genome sequencing of the new coronavirus isolated from patients' bronchoalveolar lavage fluids revealed 96% and 80% similarities with the genomes of the bat coronavirus RaTG13 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) virus, respectively (Lu et al., 2020) . This coronavirus is known as SARS-CoV-2. By July 15, 2021, there were 188,128,952 confirmed cases and 4,059,339 deaths of COVID-19 globally according to Word Health Organization (WHO). Due to many non-detected asymptomatic cases, the real number of COVID-19 infections could be larger than estimated. Moreover, asymptomatic patients are as contagious as symptomatic patients, and it is estimated that each infected individual may infect about three other individuals (Liu et al., 2020b) . Thus, developing rapid and accurate techniques for SARS-CoV-2 detection is crucial to prevent the virus from spreading further.",

Other molecular diagnostic methods such as clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and gene sequencing have the same drawbacks. Therefore, researchers sought to develop alternative diagnosis methods such as protein testing and computed tomography. Each method has its own advantages but also some limitations.

PCR requires thermal cycling. It is highly sensitive and specific for virus detection. Isothermal nucleic acid amplification is a quick detection method that can be operated under constant temperature and does not rely on thermocycler operation . The genome and proteome compositions of the virus were determined by March 24, 2020 despite the host's response to SARS-CoV-2 not being fully understood at that time. (Udugama et al., 2020) .

(b) the two-step assay, which has higher sensitivity compared with the one-step assay, since the reverse transcription occurs separately from the PCR amplification. However, this technique increases the risk of DNA contamination and needs more time (Wong and Medrano, 2005) . Corman et al. aligned many severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus genome sequences and designed related primers and probes matching conserved sequences located in three different regions: in the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP), the Envelope (E), and the nucleocapsid (N) genes. The E gene-based assay was chosen as first-line screening test, while the RdRp gene-based assay is used as confirmatory test, and further confirmation can be done by N gene-based assay. Both the RdRp gene-based and E gene-based assays are highly sensitive. The limit of detection (LOD) is an importance criterion to evaluate the performance of various detection methods. The LOD of the RdRp gene-based assay is 3.9 copies per 25 mL reaction, while that of the E gene-based assay is 3.6 copies per 25 mL reaction. Both tests are highly sensitive compared with N gene-based assay (8.3 copies per 25 mL reaction) (Corman et al., 2020a,b) .

Many methods have been implemented by researchers to improve real-time RT-PCR tests. The United States' Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) detects SARS-CoV-2 using one-step rqRT-PCR assays. During amplification, the fluorescence quenching probe is cleaved to produce a fluorescent signal in real time (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). Chan et al. designed three real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) assays to detect SARS-CoV-2 RdRp/helicase (Hel), spike (S), and N genes (Chan et al., 2020) . The limit of the RdRp/Hel detection (11.2 RNA copy per reaction) was lower than that of the other two assays. Moreover, the RdRp/Hel assay had no cross-reactivity with other coronaviruses, whereas the RdRp assay with probe 2 (RdRp-P2) cross-reacted with SARS-CoV. Wang et al. developed a novel one-step single-tube nested quantitative real-time PCR (OSN-qRT-PCR) assay to detect SARS-CoV-2, which targets the open reading frame 1ab (ORF1ab) and the N genes, and is highly sensitive (1 copy per reaction). In addition, another work presented by Rahman et al. concluded that the reliability of a commercial AusDiagnostic assay (AusDiagnostics Pty Ltd) is not as high as that of in-house real-time PCR using World Health Organization recommended genes, as shown in Fig. 1 (Rahman et al., 2020) .",

False positive reactions of one or more primers and probes with negative template controls indicate sample contamination. Also, individuals diagnosed positive by rRT-PCR may be in the clearance and recovery stage with low viral shedding and not infectious, but isolated unnecessarily (Larremore et al., 2021) . False negative results can result from mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome affecting the target region of the primers and probes. The resulting mismatches between the primers or probes and the target sequence decrease the assay performance and may generate false negative results. This can be avoided to some extent by using multiple target gene amplifications, but the specificity and sensitivity of the rRT-PCR assay may not be sufficient to definitively solve this problem . In addition, internal controls help identify samples that underwent interferences during RNA extraction and/or PCR amplification. Moreover, rRT-PCR assays highly depend on instruments and specifically trained operators, and it can take several hours to obtain results from clinical samples.",

They can operate on a tablet-PC-based device (Yoo et al., 2020) , and can be used to curb community spread of COVID-19 (James and Alawneh, 2020). LAMP is a one-step nucleic acid amplification method in which the target DNA can be amplified within an hour. It is based on the PCR technology and is the most popular diagnostic test among the isothermal amplification techniques. The LAMP reaction is highly specific due to the typical use of four to six different primers to bind the six regions of a target DNA. For RNA template, the amplification reaction can be completed in one step by the addition of a reverse transcription, and is then known as RT-LAMP reaction. Some laboratories have developed RT-LAMP tests for COVID-19 diagnosis, and such techniques have already been applied in clinical diagnosis.",

Therefore, many efforts have been made to develop more convenient and faster techniques. Lamb's group proposed an RT-LAMP test able to detect SARS-CoV-2 in simulated patient specimens within 30 min (Lamb et al., 2020) . Huang et al. also applied RT-LAMP technology and generated detection results within 30 min (Huang et al., 2020b) . They designed four LAMP primer sets targeting three regions in the ORF1ab, S, and N genes of the viral RNA, and obtained a visual detection by using a colorimetric test without the need for expensive or special instruments. The results obtained with this detection method for 16 clinical samples were verified by conventional RT-qPCR. However, this technique may generate carry-over contaminations during the amplification process, resulting in false positives. Zhang's group proposed a technique of RT-LAMP product visualization with pH-sensitive dyes that change color as pH changes (Zhang et al., 2020a) . It uses five sets of LAMP primers targeting two regions of the viral genome. However, the sensitivity is low, requiring a few hundred copies per 25 mL reaction. Zhu et al. used a one-step RT-LAMP combined with a nanoparticle-based biosensor assay to rapidly and accurately detect SARS-CoV-2 using simple equipment. The whole detection process requires only about 1 h (Zhu et al., 2020) . The detection specificity and sensitivity of this assay were both 100%.",

However, when one of the three genes was used alone, there was a reduction of specificity and/or sensitivity. Yan's group further optimized the RT-LAMP test. They designed primer sets targeting the ORF1ab (including ORF1ab-212, ORF1ab-4, ORF1ab-33, ORF1ab-22, and ORF1ab-1) and S genes (including S-107, S-123, S-67, S-41, and S-61) of SARS-CoV-2. The sensitivity of primer sets ORF1ab-4 and S-123 was 20 and 200 copies per reaction, respectively. The specificity evaluation showed that only pseudo-SARS-CoV-2 viruses were detected as positive by the RT-LAMP assay with the two primer sets (ORF1ab-4 and S-123). At the same time, the mean detection time (AE standard division) of this assay was 26.28 AE 4.48 min, while RT-PCRs take 1-2 h before completion (Yan et al., 2020) .

The process requires 30-40 min and the LOD is 10 copies/mL. The assay targets the N and E genes, and provides a positive prediction rate of 95% and a negative prediction rate of 100% (Broughton et al., 2020) . Specific high-sensitivity enzymatic reporter unlocking (SHERLOCK) proposed by Sherlock Biosciences (Boston, US) also uses a two-step process for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Sherlock Biosciences and Binx Health (Trowbridge, United Kingdom) proposed a joint product that combines Sherlock's CRISPR test with Binx's analyzer. In this work, Sherlock's assay utilizes a guide RNA that promotes the docking of the Cas13 enzyme on SARS-CoV-2 RNA. Then, the Cas13 enzyme cleaves a reporter sequence connected to an electrochemical COVID-19 Diagnostic Methods and Detection Techniques: A Review label. A measurable current is generated when the label is oxidized at an electrode (Cormac, 2020) . Abudayyeh et al. presented a simple test to detect SARS-CoV-2, known as SHERLOCK testing in one pot (STOP). STOP is a simplified detection method combining virus RNA extraction, isothermal amplification, and CRISPR-based detection. Ding's group utilized a Cas12a-based detection that targets the N gene region after RT-RPA pre-amplification. This experiment consists of a 40-min one-step reaction, and the LOD is 10 copies/mL, representing a typical LOD for Cas12a-based detection (Ding et al., 2020) . Fozouni et al. utilized real nasal swab RNA samples and developed a Cas13a-based assay to directly detect SARS-CoV-2 without the need for an amplification step. This assay reaches a sensitivity close to 100 copies/mL in less than 30 min. By combining CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) that target SARS-CoV-2 RNA with mobile phone-based quantification, the detection becomes more sensitive and specific (Fozouni, 2020) . Besides Cas12 and Cas13 proteins, other CRISPR effectors like Cas9 have been studied and applied for the detection of other pathogens (Wang et al., 2020c) .",

            "text": "Recently, serologic laboratory diagnostic tests are developed to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in blood and tissue specimens. These tests include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunochromatography assay. Zhang's group utilized ELISA to detect immunoglobulins M and G (IgM and IgG) from serum samples (Zhang et al., 2020c) . In their experiments, the SARS-CoV-2 Rp3 nucleocapsid protein served as viral antigen. This protein is 92% identical to the viral antigens of other SARS-related viruses. Zhang and colleagues found that the level of anti-Rp3 antibodies increases after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Moreover, this method can detect antibodies in blood, respiratory track, and fecal specimens (Zhang et al., 2020c ). Liu's group also designed two ELISA kits based on SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and nucleocapsid protein to detect IgG and IgM antibodies against these proteins . The positive detection rates of the two ELISAs (spike protein-based and nucleocapsid proteinbased) were 82.2% for IgM and 80.4% for IgG. In addition, the spike protein-based ELISA was more sensitive to detect anti-viral IgM than the nucleocapsid protein-based ELISA. The positive rate of IgG and IgM detection increases with the number of days after infection. The positive rate of IgG and IgM increased obviously after 10 days after disease onset, but the positive rate of IgM decreased after 35 days post-disease onset. Meanwhile, the positive rate obtained with the spike protein-and nucleocapsid protein-based IgM and IgG ELISAs was below 60% in the first 10 days post-disease onset. This indicates that ELISAs could be used as supplementary tests to the nucleic acid-based tests for detecting anti-viral antibodies with a high sensitivity in serum samples from patients, after 10 days post-disease onset.",

            "text": "Immunochromatography is another rapid detection method to diagnose COVID-19, which was used to detect antibodies in the blood. The presence of anti-viral IgM means a short time infection, while anti-viral IgG indicate that the infection is long-standing. Therefore, the rapid detection of anti-viral IgM and IgG antibodies is beneficial for controlling the disease. It can help differentiate individuals at early stage of infection, with low viral load, and who should be isolated to prevent viral spreading, from individuals who are in recovery, with detectable virus or viral RNA. This second group is below the infectious threshold, and therefore need not to be isolated so as to avoid unnecessary economic burden (Larremore et al., 2021 ). Li's team developed a rapid and simple anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM/IgG antibody test, as shown in Fig. 2 , that can detect both IgM and IgG antibodies at the same time and at different infection stages . The test strip contains three detection bands, including a control band (C line), an IgG band (G line), and an IgM band (M line). The C line turns red/purple immediately after the specimen reaches the end of the test strip, regardless of whether it is positive or negative. The M and G lines turning red/purple indicate the existence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies, respectively. The sensitivity of this test is 88.66% (352 positives from 397 COVID-19 patients' blood samples), and the specificity is 90.63% (12 positives from 128 non-COVID-19 patients' blood samples). The detection sensitivity of the combined IgM/IgG antibody test is higher than that of the individual IgM or IgG antibody tests. However, whether the assay has some cross-reactivity with anti-flu virus antibodies or antibodies recognizing other coronaviruses has not been studied. Choe et al. assessed a rapid COVID-19 detection immunochromatography-based IgG/IgM assay and made comparisons between diagnostic results obtained with this assay with those obtained by RT-PCR assays (Choe et al., 2020) . The sensitivity was 92.9% (65/70 of RT-PCR positive group) and the specificity was 96.2% (76/79 of RT-PCR negative group). The diagnostic assay did not cross-react with other flu viruses.",

            "text": "However, immunochromatography-based antibody assays can only identify COVID-19 patients who were recently infected but cannot confirm the presence of the virus in patients. Moreover, these diagnostic methods can lead to false-negative results, if (1) the antibody concentration is below the detection limit; (2) the individuals develop antibodies with different specificities. Finally, 2 weeks after onset, IgM antibodies decrease and finally vanish. Thus far, the effectiveness of immunochromatography-based antibody assays has not been sufficiently verified. To improve the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of this method it is advisable to further optimize IgM/IgG combined antibody assays against SARS-CoV-2. Dried blood spot (DBS) has long been used in serologic diagnosis in many medical fields (Amendola et al., 2021) . Some researchers developed serum assays able to detect anti-SARS-CoV-2S1 protein antibodies contained in dried blood samples (Karp et al., 2020) . This test can be operated by any individual given that it requires only dried blood samples pricked from fingers. The authors evaluated the sensitivity and specificity of this method by testing 31 patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 and 80 healthy volunteers. The result indicated that the technique can perfectly predict the positive and negative cases and both the sensitivity and specificity reached 100%. Another work by McDade's group also detected anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using blood samples from fingers (McDade et al., 2020) . Their assay was done against DBS and the sensitivity reached 97%, by testing 29 positives out of 30 confirmed COVID-19 patients. Morley et al. concluded that although further optimizations are required for DBS, it still has high sensitivity and specificity against anti-SARS-COV-2 S protein antibodies relatively to serum specimens (Morley et al., 2020) . Table 1 shows some DBS assays for COVID-19 diagnosis. Improving detection throughput has also been studied. Gaugler et al. proposed an automatic DBS processing and extracting technique in detecting human SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibody (Gaugler et al., 2021) . This work largely reduces detection cost and can support at-home testing. It is worth mentioning that the quality of DBS detection can be strongly affected by storage temperature. High temperature and sunlight can lead to bad extraction yield, as shown in Fig. 3 (Zava and Zava, 2021) .",

            "text": "Besides detecting antibodies produced in response to SARS-CoV-2 infection for diagnosis purposes, direct detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens to confirm the presence of the virus is also an option. Antigens are molecules that are specifically recognized and bound by antigen receptors on the surface of T/B lymphocytes, can trigger antibody production and induce cell-mediated immune responses. The E, N, and S proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus have been used as antigens, the S and N protein being the two main antigen targets. The S protein locates on the virus surface and is necessary for virus' entry into human cells. Various forms of the S protein are used as antigens, including full-length (S1 + S2) and partial proteins (receptor binding domain (RBD) or S1 domain) (Ernst et al., 2021) . The N protein shares $90% sequence identity with the N protein of SARS, $49% with that of MERS-CoV, and 20-36% with those of other coronaviruses including HCoV-OC43, 229E, NL63, and HKU1. The S protein has only 75% homology with SARS S protein, and only 28-33% of its amino acid sequence is identical to those of other human coronaviruses. The RBD on the C-terminus portion of S1 of SARS-Cov-2 shares 74% homology with the RBD of SARS, and 19-21% of identical amino acids with those of HKU-1, NL63, OC43, and 229E. Thus, the selection of the target protein can affect the sensitivity and specificity of detection (Ernst et al., 2021) . Wilson et al. proposed a pan-human coronavirus proteome-wide programmable phage display assay (ReScan) that can recapitulate the antigen specificities specifically enriched in serum IgGs of COVID-19 patients (Zamecnik et al., 2020) . This study identified epitopes from the N, S and ORF3a proteins by ReScan, which is a multiple diagnostic pipeline, pans human sera for SARS-CoV-2 antigens. This technique is a good candidate for enhancing diagnosis specificity. Benjamin et al. proposed a half-strip lateral flow assay that detects SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N protein (Grant et al., 2020) . When tested on a buffer containing a commercial SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid N protein as target, the LOD of this half-strip lateral flow assay was 0.65 ng/mL. Kyosei et al. presented an antigen-based detection technique for SARS-CoV-2 that combined thio-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cycling and a sandwich ELISA (Kyosei et al., 2020) . For spike protein detection, the LOD was 2.3 \u00c2 10 \u221218 M/assay in the range of 63-500 pg/mL, which equals to a level of 10 \u221220 mol per assay-supposing that each virus has $25 spike proteins on its surface-when detecting SARS-CoV-2. Another work proposed by Dan Liu et al. presented a nanozyme chemiluminescence paper-based test that can rapidly detect SARS-CoV-2 (Liu et al., 2021a) . This test delivers detection results within 16 min, and the LOD for the detection of the spike protein and pseudo virus are of 0.1 ng/mL and 360 TCID 50 /mL, respectively. Antigen tests have the advantage that they can accommodate virus mutants. Since mutated viruses still bind human cells through ACE2-binding protein, by employing ACE2 as receptor to engage with the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2, antigen tests can capture S-D614G mutants with higher affinity (about twice that of the wild-type S-614D protein) . In addition, trimeric ACE2 can be engineered to bind coronavirus S proteins with affinities several tens or even hundreds times higher (Guo et al., 2021) . This represents a big advantage compared with nucleic acid amplification-based tests, which can be impaired by mutations occurring naturally in the RNA virus variants.",

Antigen-based detection requires a process of antibody preparation that is tedious and time-consuming. It is crucial to choose the right sampling time window, due to the facts that both the viral load and infectiousness are influential (He et al., 2020) , and that appearance and disappearance of antibodies in the human body (Zhang et al., 2021) are dynamic. If the properties and status of antigen/antibody-based diagnosis is taken into consideration, currently it cannot be used as a highly accurate diagnosis tool for COVID-19. Through a combination of multiple detection methods, including nucleic acid-based and antigen/antibody recognition-based tests, the detection time window will be shortened, and the positive detection rate will increase. IgG/IgM antibody detection plays a vital role in the auxiliary diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection by providing more information about the infection stage. ",

It is a non-invasive detection method based on multiple X-ray detections performed on patient chest at different angles to generate cross-sectional images. Doctors can then analyze these images to find abnormal features and render a diagnosis . Many studies have concluded that most COVID-19 patients have typical radiologic features in chest CT images, such as multifocal plaque consolidation and ground glass opacity (Chung et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020b) . Further, researchers found that the imaging characteristics of COVID-19 is determined by the infection stage. Pan's group performed chest CT detections on 21 COVID-19 patients and established that the lung infection reaches a peak about 10 days after the onset of symptoms. They divided lung CT characteristics into four stages based on chest CT scans from 0 to 26 days after the beginning of the infection: the first corresponds to the ground glass opacity stage (0-4 days); the second is the increased stage, characterized by a crazy-paving pattern (5-8 days); the third is the consolidation stage (9-13 days); the last stage corresponds to the gradual resolution of consolidation and absence of crazy-paving pattern (! 14 days) . Bernheim et al. found that 56% of the patients cannot be diagnosed by CT scans at early stages of symptom onset . With time, consolidation, linear opacity and other pathological features became more obvious on the CT scans. This observation is largely consistent with the findings by Pan et al. Therefore, patients who test negative by RT-PCR but whose CT scans are positive should be isolated for further assessment and to prevent wide-spreading of the infection.",

For CT-based diagnosis, the equipment is expensive and requires operation by professional doctors.

Therefore, researchers are studying different types of biosensors to make the detection more convenient and suitable for at-home test. These biosensors include optical, electrical, and electrochemical sensors targeting different virus gene, nucleic acid or antibody . Parikshit et al. reported a gold nanoparticle (AuNPs)-based colorimetric test for COVID-19 diagnosis. This technique can give output in 10 min from positive isolated RNA specimens covered with suitable N-gene specific thiol-modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs). This method detected SARS-CoV-2 RNA sequences selectively and with a LOD of 0.18 ng/mL . The specificity of this biosensor was verified using MERS-CoV virus RNA, which produced no obvious change in absorbance. Seo's group assessed clinical specimens using a graphene field-effect transistor-based biosensor with anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike antibodies (Seo et al., 2020) . Their biosensor had a LOD of 242 copies/mL on clinical samples and shows specificity for SARS-CoV-2 antigen over MERS-CoV antigen. Ali et al. reported a biosensing platform created by three-dimensional (3D) nanoprinting that can detect SARS-COV-2 antibodies in a few seconds (Ali et al., 2021) . Electrodes were fabricated by 3D nanoprinting and the 3D structure allowed sensors to be loaded with a large amount of antigen. The detection principle of this biosensor is illustrated in Fig. 4 . It has a LOD of 2.8 \u00c2 10-15 M towards spike S1 protein while anti-RBD antibodies provide a LOD of 1.6 \u00c2 10-15 M. Yousefi et al. proposed a reagent-free sensor-modified electrode chip that detects SARS-CoV-2 viral particles in specimens within 5 min. This technique is based on an electrode-tethered sensor that uses antibodies to bind the analyte displayed on a negatively charged DNA linker. The sensor can detect SARS-CoV-2 in unprocessed patient's saliva in 5 min, and the LOD is 4 \u00c2 103 virus particles/mL (Yousefi et al., 2020) . Molecularly imprinted polymer-based biosensor, as shown in Fig. 5 , is also popular in molecular detection. Raziq et al. developed a molecularly imprinted polymer-based biosensor for SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein detection, which performs at a LOD of 15 fM (Raziq et al., 2021) . Table 2 shows recent developments in SARS-CoV-2 detection using different types of biosensors. These types of biosensors do not rely on any sophisticated instruments, and thus are easy for on-site use in high-risk environments. ",

One of these methods relies on DBS, as mentioned above, which has become widely used around the world. Researchers at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne (EPFL) and Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag) have proposed a technique that detects SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater (Sandy Evangelista, 2020). By analyzing wastewater samples, the virus can be detected before clinical diagnosis. This research paves the way for the development of early warning systems. In addition, there are many emerging diagnostic technologies for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Coughing sounds analysis by AI is another new direction, as shown in Fig. 1F . A work by Laguarta et al. allows pre-screening of COVID-19 patients from cough recordings by simply using an acoustic biomarker feature extractor. The general structure of this diagnosis method is shown in Fig. 6 (Laguarta et al., 2020) . This method achieves 98.5% sensitivity and 94.2% specificity for officially confirmed patients, and 100% sensitivity and 83.2% specificity for asymptomatic patients. On other aspects, AI-assisted Internet of Things (Adly et al., 2020) and big data monitoring and surveillance systems (Pham et al., 2020) can help limit the spread of COVID-19.",

            "text": "A variety of COVID-19 diagnosis methods have been developed by researchers. In general, these approaches are based on techniques including molecular tests that detect viral genomic material, antigen and antibody-based tests that detect proteins, CT examination that directly checks patient's lung, and other rapid tests like biosensors. The molecular tests have various formats. PCR tests that detect different regions of the SARS-CoV-2 genome have become the dominant method for controlling COVID-19. They are of high accuracy and stability and are generally applied in hospitals and medical institutions. However, they require centralized labs, trained personnel, and thermocycling machines for rounds of nucleic acid amplification. These methods are not suitable for large-scale applications. During outbreaks, PCR tests can lead to test shortages and delays in receiving the results, which greatly reduce the efficiency of disease prevention. Techniques such as LAMP are also molecular tests, and are less time consuming than PCR tests. They were proven comparable to PCR in terms of high sensitivity and accuracy. Antigen and antibody-based detection are established techniques and present obvious advantages for the reduction of detection time. They can be deployed in high-risk applications, such as clinics, supermarkets, public transportations, and educational institutions, and operated by personnel with little or no specialized training. The sensitivity of rapid antigen-based tests is about one order of magnitude lower than that of the PCR-based tests (1000 copies/mL for PCR compared with 10,000 copies/mL for LFA antigen test) (Cormac, 2020) . Given delay between the onset of infection and detectable antibody responses, antibody-based tests are of little value for early capture of active infections in individuals. Therefore, antigen-based tests are more suitable for large-scale detection and discovery of latent infections, while antibody-based tests can be applied to patients who already had obvious symptoms. It is worth mentioning that a number of researchers are studying the use of dried blood spots for COVID-19 detection. This technique is inexpensive and can be operated by individuals in-home with high convenience. Therefore, this method has great potential to help realize large-scale detection. CT have been used as an auxiliary method to nucleic acid-based tests for COVID-19 diagnosis in hospitals. Emerging detection methods like biosensors are thought to realize large-scale detection in all kinds of public areas. Other detection methods like microfluidic devices and smartphone surveillance systems are also under research to prevent COVID-19 from further spreading. It should be pointed out that epidemic prevention, control, and clinical diagnosis require different systems. At present, epidemic prevention and control rely on disease diagnosis. However, epidemic prevention and control do not need highly sensitive and accurate test, as required in clinical diagnosis, but rather rapid, frequent, and large-scale screening of the population. A recent study by Professor Mina of the Harvard University has shown that with rapid and large-scale screening methods, even if the LOD is 100-1000 time worse than RT-PCR and there is a 10% false negative rate, as long as the population coverage can reach 50-75% and the screening can be performed periodically with a period of 1-7 days, the epidemic could be quickly contained within a few weeks without using vaccine (Larremore et al., 2021) . Therefore, epidemic prevention and control require large-scale population screening and rapid results. The effectiveness of this strategy has been proven by the world's first population scale screening in Slovakia (Mahase, 2020) . In this regard, nucleic acid amplification-based detection methods are actually neither practical nor convenient. Rather, rapid detection, such as those relying on antigen detection or isothermal nucleic acid amplification, is needed. Serological antibody testing methods are suitable for judging whether infected individuals are at early stage of infection or in recovery, so as to avoid unnecessary isolation. In summary, there is no COVID-19 test that can fit all scenarios (Mina and Andersen, 2021) . Different testing scenarios require different testing technologies with varying sensitivity, specificity, speed, frequency, coverage, cost, and ease of operation (Weissleder et al., 2020) . Technologies under development and new products should consider all of these factors. An integrated approach combining various methods could be an effective way to control the COVID-19 pandemic.",
