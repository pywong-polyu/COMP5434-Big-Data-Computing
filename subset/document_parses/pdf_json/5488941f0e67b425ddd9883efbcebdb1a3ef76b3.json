However, state-of-the-art phylogenomics requires running complex pipelines, at significant computational and labour costs, with additional constraints in sequencing coverage, assembly and annotation quality. To overcome these challenges, we present Read2tree, which directly processes raw sequencing reads into groups of corresponding genes. In a benchmark encompassing a broad variety of datasets, our assembly-free approach was 10-100x faster than conventional approaches, and in most cases more accurate-the exception being when sequencing coverage was high and reference species very distant. To illustrate the broad applicability of the tool, we reconstructed a yeast tree of life of 435 species spanning 590 million years of evolution. Applied to Coronaviridae samples, Read2Tree accurately classified highly diverse animal samples and near-identical SARS-CoV-2 sequences on a single tree-thereby exhibiting remarkable breadth and depth. The speed, accuracy, and versatility of Read2Tree enables comparative genomics at scale.",

The current best practices optimise this process using costly technology combinations-such as long and short read sequencing-and multiple rounds of parameter optimizations across multiple pipelines.

The constituting consortia are making progress streamlining and optimising the sequencing and annotation process, but the orthology inference and tree inference steps remain highly challenging. In parallel, considerable genome sequencing activity is taking place in individual labs, with sample sizes of hundreds to thousands of genomes per study becoming common 16 . However, depending on the species of interest, high-quality reference genomes are often lacking, and individual labs often lack the computational infrastructure or expertise to fully leverage the data across individual analysis steps. This is exemplified in major consortia-led studies requiring years and millions of dollars to elucidate the evolution of certain species of interest. Or most recently, the use of various pipelines to assess variation and report assemblies from SARS-CoV-2.

Read2Tree is able to provide a full phylogenetic comparison of hundreds of samples in a fraction of time compared to current established pipelines. Crucially, the speed up is achieved without compromising the accuracy of the resulting trees. In addition, Read2Tree is able to also provide accurate trees and species comparisons using only low coverage (0.1x) data sets as well as RNA vs. genomic sequencing and operates on long or short reads. This makes Read2Tree a highly versatile method to obtain key insight from a single sample scaling up to thousands of samples. To establish this novel approach we assess its performance on a battery of genomic and transcriptomic datasets spanning different kingdoms, divergence time, and sequencing technology. Subsequently we apply Read2Tree to construct a large yeast tree of life and apply it to compare SARS-CoV-2 samples-thus highlighting the accuracy (e.g. compared to NCBI classification) and speed of Read2Tree.

With Read2Tree, we directly process raw sequencing reads and reconstruct sequence alignments for conventional tree inference methods ( Fig  1B, SFig 1) . We start by aligning raw reads to nucleotide sequences derived from the genome-wide reference orthologous groups (Fig 1B: 1) . Within each orthologous group, we reconstruct protein sequences from reads aligned to reference sequences (Fig 1B: 2) . Importantly, these sequences in reference orthologous groups are not restricted to singlecopy marker genes, such as the mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I (COI) gene or BUSCO genes 20 ; they also include multiple paralogous genes as well as non-universal genes. This is achieved by leveraging orthologous groups computed from 2500 diverse genomes analysed in the Orthologous Matrix (OMA) resource developed in our lab 21, 22 . Next, we retain the best reference-guided reconstructed sequence, using the number of reconstructed nucleotide bases as criterion ( Fig. 1B: 3, SFig 2) . Subsequently, the selected consensus is added to the orthologous group's multiple sequence alignment (Fig 1B: 4) . Finally, orthologous group selection and tree inference can proceed using conventional methods (we use IQTREE 23 by default; Fig 1B: 5) . See Methods for greater detail on the individual steps.",

For sequence reconstruction accuracy (Fig 2B) , we measured both the correctness of the reconstructed sequences (\"precision\") and the completeness of the reconstructed sequences (\"recall\"). For tree reconstruction accuracy (Fig 2C) , we compare the reconstructed tree with the known species phylogeny and report both the topological distance and whether the target species was correctly placed. In general, Read2Tree was able to maintain a high precision in terms of sequence reconstruction (Fig 2B) and tree reconstruction (Fig 2C) across all datasets, with varying levels of recall depending on the dataset difficulty. First we assessed the effect of coverage ranging from 0.2x to 20x of the individual data sets. We observed that increasing the sequencing coverage had little impact on precision, and mainly lowered recall. Thus, remarkably, Read2Tree is able to maintain typically 90-95% precision at the sequence level even with coverages as low as 0.2x (Fig 2B) . The best low-coverage results were obtained on transcriptomic short read data in mice, where precision reached 98.5% at 0.2x coverage. To assess the versatility of Read2Tree we benchmarked it across DNA and RNA data sets. This did not have a large impact in general, but transcriptomic RNA results (in the mouse dataset) are marginally less impacted by differences in average coverage, perhaps due to the large coverage variance from uneven gene expression levels in these data (see Fig  2B&C) . Next, we assessed if Read2Tree is capable of utilising the range of current sequencing technologies. For this we applied it across traditional short reads, Oxford Nanopore and PacBio long reads. To enable this, Read2Tree has slightly different mapping strategies built in for long vs. short reads (see methods). As Figure 2B&C shows Read2Tree maintained a high accuracy across each sequencing technology, but we observed the highest accuracy over traditional short reads. We have not assessed more recent sequencing technologies such as PacBio HiFi or Illumina infinity that might change this result.",

For the inclusion of orthologous markers in the concatenated alignment used for tree inference, we required a commonly set minimum threshold of 80% taxon presence. As above, we varied the closest remaining species in the dataset by removing species along the reference tree (Fig 2. A) . With different coverages and reference sets, we obtained 42 data points per species. For each of these data points we performed the orthology inference separately and recorded its computation time. The proportion of sequences placed into the respective OGs showed high levels of variation (SFig 5). For each assembly and variation of proteomes, we computed the topological distance between the resulting tree from assembly or Read2Tree with trees obtained using high quality genome assemblies for A. thaliana and S. cerevisiae. Figure 3 shows the overall results highlighting the performance of Read2Tree. Perhaps unsurprisingly, we observed that coverage levels had a profound impact on the performance of assembly-based approaches rendering them incapable of dealing with coverages below 5-10x.

Using Read2Tree these limitations can be overcome even with low-coverage, cost-effective Illumina data.

Accuracy was measured as blast percentage identity and recall as the total number of obtained AAs in the concatenated MSA of all OGs.

For ONT reads we assembled the reads using Canu 57 (v2.0) with a specified genome size (genomeSize) gnuplotTested=true -nanopore-raw and useGrid=false parameters to run it locally on only one node on the cluster. Lastly for PacBio CLR data we also used Canu (v2.0) with similar parameters, but specifying the -pacbio-raw parameter. All runtimes were measured using linux time and the wall and CPU Time were recorded. The RNA seq data was assembled differently to the whole genome. For Illumina we used Trinity 58 (v2.8.5) with the following parameters: --seqType fq --max_memory 50G --left reads1.fq.gz --right reads2.fq.gz --CPU 6 --trimmomatic --full_cleanup --output prefix.

Then we removed according to Figure 2 the relevant species, adding each time the assembly for mouse, yeast or thale cress in the set and run the orthology prediction with standard parameters (OMA v.2.2.1). Thus for instance for the Illumina M. musculus 10X assembly we run OMA 7 times for all reference datasets with increasing distance to its closest relative. In total we run 126 different OMA runs with 7 variations of reference proteomes and 3 variations of technologies 3 coverage levels for A. thaliana and S. cervisiea. Additionally, we run 21 times OMA for M. musculus for 5X, 10X and 20X Illumina assemblies. The all vs all part was parallelized on 1000 nodes and the final part was run on a single node with 40G memory. To obtain OGs for tree inference we applied the 0.8 taxonomic occupancy threshold as previously. OGs were filtered according to the procedure in Shen et al. (see below).

Selected species are available in the Supplementary file 3. Reads from the SRA database were mapped according to their sequencing methodology using Read2Tree. In order to compare our analysis to Shen et al 2018 we aimed to have as many species in common as possible. For this purpose we complemented our tree with additional sequences that we simulated from missing species in our tree that were present in the Shen et al 2018 tree.

Since our approach does not place multiple sequences from the same species into one OG we skipped the removal of putative paralogs. Within the alignments we changed all \"X\" with the gapcharacter \"-\". Then we applied trimAl v1.4.rev15 (-gappyout). Then we removed protein sequences whose lengths were shorter than 50% the length of the trimmed multiple sequence alignment length of each OG they belonged to. We also removed OGs whose total trimmed multiple sequence alignment length was < 167 amino acid sites. These resulted in 926 alignments. With these alignments we used IQTREE ( v1.6.9) with automatic model selection to compute trees. Then we identified species in the gene trees that had a branch length longer than 20 times the median of all branch lengths. We removed these species from the respected alignments again controlling that the more than 171 species are included. Then we computed the tree using iqtree (-seed 12345, -m LG+G4, -bb 1000, -nt 20).",

Best sequence identity is obtained for Illumina data. Colours convey the increasing evolutionary distance to the closest reference species.
