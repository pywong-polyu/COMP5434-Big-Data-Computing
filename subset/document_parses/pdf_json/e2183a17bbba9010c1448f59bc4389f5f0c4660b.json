            "text": "The outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 (SARS2) has caused a global COVID-19 pandemic. The spike protein of SARS2 (SARS2-S) recognizes host receptors, including ACE2, to initiate viral entry in a complex biomechanical environment. Here, we reveal that tensile force, generated by bending of the host cell membrane, strengthens spike recognition of ACE2 and accelerates the detachment of spike's S1 subunit from the S2 subunit to rapidly prime the viral fusion machinery. Mechanistically, such mechano-activation is fulfilled by force-induced opening and rotation of spike's receptor-binding domain to prolong the bond lifetime of spike/ACE2 binding, up to 4 times longer than that of SARS-S binding with ACE2 under 10 pN force application, and subsequently by force-accelerated S1/S2 detachment which is up to~10 3 times faster than that in the no-force condition. Interestingly, the SARS2-S D614G mutant, a more infectious variant, shows 3-time stronger force-dependent ACE2 binding and 35-time faster force-induced S1/S2 detachment. We also reveal that an anti-S1/S2 non-RBD-blocking antibody that was derived from convalescent COVID-19 patients with potent neutralizing capability can reduce S1/S2 detachment by 3 \u00d7 10 6 times under force. Our study sheds light on the mechano-chemistry of spike activation and on developing a non-RBD-blocking but S1/S2-locking therapeutic strategy to prevent SARS2 invasion.",

The initial entry of SARS2 or SARS into the host cell occurs in two vital steps, receptor recognition by the spike protein and subsequent conformational changes of the spike to form fusion machinery. [7] [8] [9] Both steps are respectively governed by two subunits of the spike, S1 and S2. Receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S1 subunit is mainly responsible for ACE2 recognition, and the S2 subunit forms fusion machinery to target host-cell plasma membrane (PM) after S1/S2 detachment (Supplementary information, Fig. S1a ). [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The sequences of SARS2-and SARS-RBDs are similar (Supplementary information, Fig. S1b ), with highly conserved ACE2 contact residues. [13] [14] [15] Minimal structural changes of SARS2 spike upon ACE2 binding seem not significant enough to trigger the detachment of tightly associated S1 and S2 subunits, for which additional factors might be required.",

            "text": "SARS2 and SARS primarily target the respiratory tract associated with complex mechanical cues. [16] [17] [18] [19] For instance, tensile force induced by membrane bending has been reported to be involved in cell-cell contact as well as in endocytosis. [20] [21] [22] [23] These two physiological processes are reminiscent of viral attachment onto and entry into host cells, leaving the role of membrane bending in viral invasion enigmatic. Similar to endocytosis, once a virion attaches to the epithelium layers of the lung airway, the bent epithelial cell membrane might exert tensile force on the single spike/ACE2 binding complex, which inevitably impacts spike/ACE2 binding and resultant viral host recognition, attachment, and invasion. Several recent studies have reported the structures of the SARS2-RBD with human ACE2 in the static force-free condition, merely demonstrating a similar contact interface to that of the SARS-RBD/ACE2 complex (Supplementary information, Fig. S1c ). It has also been reported that SARS2 and SARS spikes or RBDs bind to ACE2 with similar binding affinities, [24] [25] [26] which hardly explains SARS2's higher contagiousness than SARS. Moreover, S1/S2 tight contact observed from spike structures [26] [27] [28] [29] and the observation that the majority of spikes on pre-fused SARS2 viruses are in pre-fusion state 30, 31 hardly support the spontaneous S1/S2 dissociation model that is proposed based on the recent observation of post-fusion S2 protein in purified full-length wild-type spikes. 27 All of these raise questions whether and how tensile force regulates spike's dissociation from ACE2 during viral invasion into host cells, whether the mechano-dependent binding differentiates SARS2 and SARS, and whether follow-up S1/S2 detachment also requires or is accelerated by tensile force.",

SARS2 shows greater force-enhanced spike recognition of ACE2 than SARS, in good agreement with its higher infectivity. Such mechanical enhancement is very likely to be a universal regulatory mechanism for the invasion of other beta-coronaviruses. A D614G variation of SARS2 spike enhances force-dependent spike recognition of ACE2 and speeds up the follow-up S1/S2 detachment simultaneously. Moreover, we also identify an S1/S2-binding, non-RBD-blocking, and neutralizing antibody derived from convalescent COVID-19 patients that can unexpectedly restrain force-accelerated S1/S2 detachment.",

            "text": "Mechanical force prolongs SARS2-RBD/ACE2 bond lifetime to impede their dissociation To test whether tensile force regulates spike/ACE2 binding and stiffness, we first carried out single-molecule biomechanical experiments with biomembrane force probe (BFP) to quantify the molecular stiffness of the spike/ACE2 complex (Supplementary information, Fig. S2 ) and the force-dependent RBD dissociation from ACE2 on live cells (Fig. 1c , d; Supplementary information, Fig. S3 ). We found that the molecular stiffness of the spike/ACE2 complex is about 1.8 pN/nm (Supplementary information, Fig. S2c ). Increasing mechanical force at a low-force regime (< 10 pN) prolongs bond lifetimes of both SARS2-RBD WT and SARS-RBD WT binding with ACE2 ( Fig. 1e; Supplementary information, Fig. S3c , d). Optimal force (~10 pN) results in maximum bond lifetimes (3.3 s and 0.7 s respectively for SARS2-RBD WT and SARS-RBD WT binding with ACE2), whereas further increasing force beyond 10 pN shortens their bond lifetimes. This optimal force falls in the theoretical range that each spike/ACE2 bond bears (Fig. 1b) . This force-strengthened RBD/ACE2 binding suggests that mechanical cues can be exploited by both SARS2 and SARS to enhance its recognition of host ACE2 and attachment to host cells. Furthermore, the longer force-dependent bond lifetime of SARS2-RBD WT /ACE2 (Fig. 1e) is consistent with and might explain the higher infectivity of SARS2, 37 despite similar contact areas in SARS2-RBD/ACE2 and SARS-RBD/ACE2 complex structures (Supplementary information, Fig. S1b , c) and comparable in-solution [24] [25] [26] and in-situ binding affinities of SARS2-RBD or SARS-RBD to ACE2 (Supplementary information, Fig. S4 ). Together, these results suggest that the force-dependent dissociation rate of RBD/ACE2 binding is a key factor for regulating both SARS2 and SARS viral infection.",

            "text": "Two force-induced intermediate binding states govern mechanical enhancement of SARS2-RBD/ACE2 interaction To dissect the dynamical and structural mechanisms of the mechano-enhanced RBD/ACE2 binding, we next performed steered molecular dynamics (SMD) simulations on SARS2-RBD WT / ACE2 and SARS-RBD WT /ACE2 complexes, and examined their force-induced conformational change and dissociation pathway at atomic resolution. For SARS2-RBD WT /ACE2 dissociation, we found that the tensile force drove the SARS2-RBD WT rotation on the binding interface and gradually increased the inter-domain angle (\u03b1) from~125\u00b0at force-free initial state (I 0 ) to~140\u00b0(Intermediate state 1, I 1 ) and then to~170\u00b0(Intermediate state 2, I 2 ) followed by RBD/ACE2 dissociation, and the inter-domain area (nm 2 ) gradually decreased under the tensile force (Fig. 2a, c; Supplementary information, Fig. S5a , b, Video S2). In the I 1 state, the binding conformation only changes very little compared with the forcefree I 0 state. In the I 2 state, only RBD's receptor-binding motif (RBM) interacts with ACE2 while the other regions dissociate (Supplementary information, Fig. S5c , e, f). Similar force-induced conformational changes on SARS2-RBD WT /ACE2 binding interface were observed along this dissociation pathway (denoted as P 1 ) in all 9 independent simulations (Fig. 2e) . Interestingly, other than the P 1 pathway (Supplementary information, Video S3), another pathway (denoted as P 2 ; Supplementary information, Video S4) was also identified (Fig. 2b , d; Supplementary information, Fig. S5a , b, d) in SARS-RBD WT /ACE2 dissociation. In the P 2 pathway, the intermediate state I 2 is absent, causing direct dissociation of SARS-2 RBD WT /ACE2 from the state I 1 . The P 1 and P 2 pathways occurred 4 and 5 times respectively in 9 independent simulations of SARS-RBD WT /ACE2 dissociation (Fig. 2e) . Thus, the incidence of the P 2 pathway in SARS-RBD WT /ACE2 forced dissociation is 55%, which is much higher than that in SARS2-RBD WT /ACE2 forced dissociation (0%, i.e., no occurrence). The ability of SARS-RBD to resist forced dissociation from ACE2 is weaker in the P 2 than in the P 1 pathway, as no force-induced drastic rotational conformational changes solely sustained by RBM/ACE2 binding occurred in the P 2 pathway. Together, these findings provide biophysical evidence to support the force-strengthened bond lifetime of SARS2-RBD WT /ACE2 binding. We thus postulated that force-induced intermediate states governed dissociation pathway selection and forceenhanced SARS2-RBD WT /ACE2 binding.",

            "text": "To further test this hypothesis, we then aimed to identify key residues for regulating the stability of two intermediate states and for selecting the dissociation pathways in ACE2 interacting with SARS2-RBD WT or SARS-RBD WT . We examined the residues located at RBD/ACE2 binding interface that were essential for forming either I 1 or I 2 states. For SARS2-RBD WT , force promotes hydrogen bond (H-bond) formation of its Q493 with ACE2-K31 when switching from the I 0 to I 1 state (Fig. 3a , b, d; Supplementary information, Fig. S6a ); for SARS-RBD WT , corresponding residue N479 either forms H-bond or not with ACE2-K31 in the I 0 state of P 1 or P 2 pathway respectively, and force does not change N479 binding state with ACE2-K31 when switching from the I 0 to I 1 state in both pathways (Fig. 3c , d; Supplementary information, Fig. S6b, c) . For the I 2 state, it is defined by the interaction between SARS2-RBD WT RBM and ACE2. The interaction, mainly formed by the hydrophobic packing of SARS2-RBD WT -F486 with the hydrophobic center formed by L79, M82, and Y83 of ACE2, solely maintains SARS2-RBD WT /ACE2 binding after the force-induced RBD rotation (Fig. 3e , g; Supplementary information, Fig. S6d ). In contrast, for SARS-RBD WT , these interactions are unstable even in the absence of force (Supplementary information, Fig. S6e , f), as they frequently switch between bound (55% of times) and unbound (45% of times) states (Fig. 3f) . The bound state favors the P 1 pathway (75% of occurrence frequency), whereas the unbound state more likely (80% of occurrence frequency) leads to the P 2 pathway for faster RBD/ACE2 dissociation (Fig. 3f ). Simulations on F486L mutant (SARS2-RBD F486L ) further reveal unstable SARS2-RBD F486L /ACE2 associations (Supplementary information, Fig. S7 ) in the absence of force, confirming the importance of F486 in maintaining RBD/ACE2 mechanical stability. Moreover, both SARS2-RBD Q493N and F486L mutations reduce the force-dependent bond lifetime of SARS2-RBD/ACE2 interaction, shortening the maximum bond lifetime almost by two to three folds (Fig. 3h , i; Supplementary information, Fig. S3e , f). Together, these results collectively suggest a model of mechano-enhanced viral infection in which tensile mechanical force can enhance spike binding with ACE2 to foster viral infection.",

SARS2 with spike D614G variation was more epidemic with enhanced replication and transmission than that without this variation. [38] [39] [40] [41] D614G mutation was reported to decrease S1/S2 cleavage 42 and increase incorporation of the spike into the pseudo-virion. 42, 43 However, the authentic virion does not demonstrate these phenotypes, 44, 45 suggesting that the changed level of S1/S2 cleavage or spike incorporation into the virion is not a convincing explanation for the higher infectivity of the D614G mutant. Moreover, SARS2-S WT and SARS2-S D614G have comparable binding affinities to ACE2 as both slightly increased and decreased affinities of the mutant to ACE2 were reported. 39, 42, [46] [47] [48] Considering that D614G variation makes RBD more flexible and more readily to adopt an up conformation, 39 we hypothesized that D614G mutation might affect force-dependent regulation of the SARS2-S/ACE2 bond lifetime. Indeed, we found that SARS2-S D614G bound ACE2 much more strongly than SARS2-S WT under force with an almost four-time longer optimal lifetime (11.2 s for SARS2-S D614G vs 3.2 s for SARS2-S WT ) under the 10 pN optimal force ( Fig. 4a ; Supplementary information, Fig. S3g -i). In contrast, SARS2-S WT , SARS2-S1 WT , SARS2-S1 D614G , and SARS2-RBD WT bind ACE2 with almost the same force-dependent bond lifetimes ( Fig. 4a; Supplementary information, Fig. S8 ). These results demonstrate that D614G variation enhances force-dependent SARS2-S recognition of ACE2.",

Using SMD simulations, we pulled a spike trimer on its RBDs ( Fig. 5a ; Supplementary information, Video S5) and observed that mechanical force indeed decreased the contact area between S1 and S2 from~450 nm 2 to~0 nm 2 , leading to rapid S1/S2 detachment (Supplementary information, Fig. S9a ). Consequently, SARS2-S WT extended~23 nm in the direction of force application (Supplementary information, Fig. S9b ), which was further validated and confirmed with our single-molecule magnetic tweezers (MT) pulling experiments (Fig. 5b, c) . Single SARS2-S WT presents a pronounced conformational extension (~26.6 nm) mostly under 11.3 pN pulling force ( Fig. 5f , g). Based on Bell model, 49 the S1/S2 detachment rate (or unfolding rate, k u ) of SARS2-S WT is 2.9 \u00d7 10 -4 s \u22121 in the absence of force, suggesting that S1/S2 detachment is unlikely to occur spontaneously. Instead, we found that only 10 pN tensile force could drastically increase the detachment rate to 0.2 s \u22121 (Fig. 5h) , almost 1000 times faster than that in no-force condition, further demonstrating the essential role of mechanical force on activating and accelerating S1/S2 rapid detachment.

Moreover, in the presence of 3H3 mAb, a larger force (~24.3 pN) on average was required to induce a shorter extension distance (~20.2 nm) needed for SARS2-S WT S1/S2 detachment (Fig. 5d, f) , dramatically decreasing S1/S2 detachment rate by~3 \u00d7 10 6 folds from 0.2 s \u22121 to 6.2 \u00d7 10 -8 s \u22121 under~10 pN force (Fig. 3h ). This clearly suggests that 3H3 mAb locks S1/S2 subunits together to stabilize SARS2-S even under force loading, potentially preventing follow-up fusion machinery formation and viral invasion. In contrast, another non-RBD-blocking, S1/S2-binding, and non-neutralizing mAb (clone 4A10, also derived from convalescent COVID-19 patient), 50 hardly affects S1/S2 detachment (Fig. 5e-h) .

The D614G variation reduces the number of interdomain hydrogen bonds (Fig. 6a, b) , specifically abolishing two hydrogen bonds between D614 and K854 or Q836 (Fig. 6b, c) . This led us to hypothesize that D614G variation might weaken S1/S2 association. We next performed single-molecule pulling experiments with MT to characterize S1/S2 mechanical stability in the presence of the D614G variation. Interestingly, a shorter S1/S2 detaching distance on average (~19.1 nm) was observed for a single SARS2-S D614G (Fig. 6d, e) , suggesting that the D614G variation partially impairs S1/ S2 assembly. Compared with 11.3 pN force to detach S1/S2 in SARS2-S WT , a much smaller tensile force (~8.2 pN) is required to detach S1 and S2 in SARS2-S D614G (Fig. 6d, f) , drastically increasing the detachment rate by 35 times from 0.2 s \u22121 (for SARS2-S WT ) to 7.2 s \u22121 under~10 pN force (Fig. 6g) . These results suggest that S1/ S2 subunits in SARS2-S D614G are less mechanically stable than those in SARS2-S WT . Integrating force-dependent spike/ACE2 disassociation and S1/S2 detachment kinetics, we built up a kinetic model and revealed that the D614G variant with stronger force-dependent ACE2 binding not only accelerated S1/S2 detachment but also had an 8-time higher probability than WT to make this detachment occur (0.92 for D614G vs 0.1 for WT at 8.4 pN) (Fig. 6h, i) , providing an unprecedented quantitative kinetic evidence and molecular mechanism to explain higher infectivity of the D614G variant (Fig. 4b, c) .",

Our finding of force-strengthened spike/ACE2 binding provides molecular evidence to support the notion that the attachment of SARS2 virion on the host-cell PM survives longer than SARS in a biomechanical environment. This is reminiscent of the previous observations that mechanical force favors membrane fusion and endocytosis, 22, 51, 52 which are two common routes utilized by the coronavirus to enter host cells. 10, 11, 53, 54 As receptor binding and the follow-up S1/S2 detachment are both essential to trigger the S2 structural rearrangement and fusion machinery formation for the effective viral infection, [10] [11] [12] SARS2-S-binding mAbs with neutralization potency are applied for therapeutic interventions of COVID-19. While most of the studies focused on searching for neutralizing mAbs that block SARS2-S-RBD/ACE2 binding, 55-57 our findings identify an alternative neutralizing strategy that exploits non-RBD-blocking but S1/S2locking antibodies to stabilize SARS2-S structure by preventing S1/ S2 detachment and follow-up S2 fusion machinery formation. Such strategy potentially can compensate or complement receptor-blocking strategy no matter what other novel spike receptor is found. 6, 58 This finding also suggests that mAbs targeting S1/S2 epitopes and restraining S1/S2 detachment may provide high neutralization potency against SARS2 infection by inhibiting pre-fusion-to-post-fusion transition of SARS2-S.",

As the D614G variation disrupts stable contact between inter-protomers to allosterically favor more SARS2-RBD up conformation, 39 this enhancement of force-dependent recognition might be due to the synergistic effect of two or three up RBDs in a single SARS2-S trimer. Although the detailed molecular mechanism for such a synergetic effect is still unclear, there are several possible explanations. One plausible explanation is that the S1 subunits of all three protomers in the D614G variant are more flexible such that it may release the spatial restriction to allow more than one RBD binding with ACE2 dimer simultaneously. Another alternative explanation is that ACE2 sequentially binds with each up RBD of SARS2-S D614G via sliding-rebinding mechanism. 59 Also, we can hardly rule out the possibility that D614G variation may cause a larger extent of force-induced rotational conformational changes of RBD, thereby resulting in a longer force-dependent bond lifetime of SARS2-S/ACE2 binding.",

First, all single-molecule assays performed here were with a widely used soluble recombinant SARS2-S that differs from the native protein in three aspects: 'GSAS' and 'PP' substitutions at residues 682-685 and 986-987, and synthetic trimerization helix substitution at the transmembrane domain, were introduced to stabilize the trimer. Thus, the structures of the native spike might differ from what we observe in the context of the ectodomain. Second, we propose that the D614G variation of SARS2-S could allosterically strengthen its binding with ACE2 under force and simultaneously enhance the force-accelerated S1/S2 detachment, which might favor effective viral infection. However, our experiments do not rule out other possibilities as potential mechanisms. [42] [43] [44] [45] Third, confirmative experimental evidence that mechanical force directly affects SARS2 infection in a setting of authentic SARS2 and live cells is still absent, although we demonstrate that SARS2 exploits mechanical force to impede spike/ACE2 dissociation and accelerate subsequent S1/S2 detachment for effective pseudovirus infection. Fourth, all the SARS2-S mutant infection experiments were performed using pseudovirus infection models in established cell lines, and therefore the results obtained need to be confirmed by authentic SARS2 virus infection experiments in the future. Finally, we propose an alternative neutralizing strategy, the S1/S2-locking neutralization antibody, which also needs to be further investigated.",

For the bond lifetime measurement, an ACE2-expressing U937 cell was driven to approach to and contact recombinant protein-coated microsphere. After 0.1 s of contact, the cell was retracted at 1000 pN/s and clamped at a preset force until the bond broke. The bond lifetime was defined as the duration of the clamped phase. To ensure that~90% bond lifetimes were generated from a single bond, the adhesion frequency was kept < 20% by adjusting recombinant protein densities on the microspheres.

S2a, S3a). When F < 0 pN, the slope of the curve represents the stiffness of the cell (k c , assuming that spike/ACE2 is incompressible). When F > 0 pN, the slope of the curve represents the stiffness (k s ) of the serially connected system, containing a single spike/ACE2 bond and the cell. According to Hooke's law, we can calculate k m = 1/(1/k s \u2212 1/k c ) for each force vs displacement curve.",

            "text": "To estimate the forces exerted on the spike/ACE2 bonds, we first considered the force equilibrium of the virion and then the force equilibrium of the virion and host-cell PM system. As the virion bears forces from the spike/ACE2 bonds, the force equilibrium of the virion requires the resultant force from the spike/ACE2 bonds to be zero. For the force equilibrium of virion and host-cell PM system, the total energy includes the energy stored in the bent host-cell PM and that stored in the deformed spike/ACE2 bonds. After the spike/ACE2 bond forms, the hostcell PM bending and the spike/ACE2 bond deformation must satisfy the compatibility condition. According to the theorem of minimum potential energy, the host-cell PM bending and spike/ACE2 bond deformation should reach the lowest total elastic potential energy. Different types of virus have stiffness ranging from 0.04 to 1 GPa, 35 while different cells have PM stiffness ranging from 0.1 to a few tens of kPa. 36 As a result of the significant difference in these stiffnesses, the virus shape change is negligible, and the host-cell PM adopts the shape of the virion during the virus entry. Since the virion contacts the host-cell PM in a rotationally symmetric manner, we used a spherical coordinate to describe the space with the origin at the center of the virion (O in Fig. 1a) . Any location on the virion shell can be specified by the polar angle (\u03c6) which is defined as an angle between the z-axis (the nadir direction) and the vector from the origin (O) to this location. The angle between the z-axis and the vector from the O' to the same location is denoted by \u03c60. The contact zone can be quantified by the polar angle (\u03c6 C ) which is defined as the angle between the z-axis and the vector from the origin (O) to the very end of the contact edge (Fig. 1a) . For simplicity, we assumed the bent host-cell PM roughly lies on a sphere with the center at O' and the radius of R. The spike/ACE2 bond supports the virion attached to the host-cell PM, leading to a gap between the virion envelope and the host-cell PM. At a certain location \u03c6 in the contact zone, the gap is equal to the spike/ACE2 bond length (l \u03c6 ). The gap at the apex of the virion is denoted by l apex , which is the same as the length of spike/ACE2 bond at the apex. The radius R and gap l apex could change when the contact zone grows. With R and l apex , the length of spike/ACE2 bond at \u03c6 can be described as l \u03c6 \u00bc R \u00c0 r sin \u03c6 sin \u03c6 0 (Fig. 1a) , where r (45 nm) 30 is the radius of the virion and:",

During the virus entry, the host-cell PM can be divided into three parts: (1) the PM in contact with virus bending to a spherical surface; (2) the PM far away from the contact zone keeping in flat without bending; and (3) the PM in the transition zone joining the flat and spherical contact zone that bends to a surface with negative Gaussian curvature. The bending energy is zero in the flat membrane. To minimize the bending energy, the host-cell PM with negative Gaussian curvature must favor a minimal surface for two reasons: the surface area is minimal, and the tension is minimal; the mean curvature is zero, and the bending energy is zero. This minimal curvature membrane has also been found in virus-cell fusion. 78 Therefore, we assume the host-cell PM in the transition zone approximately adopts a minimal surface, and the bending energy is dominantly stored in the spherical contact zone.
