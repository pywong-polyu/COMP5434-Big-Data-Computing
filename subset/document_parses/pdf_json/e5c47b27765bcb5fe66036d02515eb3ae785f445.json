            "text": "In the last century, the increase in traffic, human activities and industrial production have led to a diffuse presence of air pollution, which causes an increase of risk of several health conditions such as respiratory diseases. In Europe, air pollution is a serious concern that affects several areas, one of the worst ones being northern Italy, and in particular the Po Valley, an area characterized by low air quality due to a combination of high population density, industrial activity, geographical factors and weather conditions. Public health authorities and local administrations are aware of this problem, and periodically intervene with temporary traffic limitations and other regulations, often insufficient to solve the problem. In February 2020, this area was the first in Europe to be severely hit by the SARS-CoV-2 virus causing the COVID-19 disease, to which the Italian government reacted with the establishment of a drastic lockdown. This situation created the condition to study how significant is the impact of car traffic and industrial activity on the pollution in the area, as these factors were strongly reduced during the lockdown. Differently from some areas in the world, a drastic decrease in pollution measured in terms of particulate matter (PM) was not observed in the Po Valley during the lockdown, suggesting that several external factors can play a role in determining the severity of pollution. In this study, we report the case study of the city of Pavia, where data coming from 23 air quality sensors were analyzed to compare the levels measured during the lockdown with the ones coming from the same period in 2019. Our results show that, on a global scale, there was a statistically significant reduction in terms of PM levels taking into account meteorological variables that can influence pollution such as wind, temperature, humidity, rain and solar radiation. Differences can be noticed analyzing daily pollution trends too, as-compared to the study period in 2019-during the study period in 2020 pollution was higher in the morning and lower in the remaining hours.",

            "text": "In the last decades, air pollution has become a major threat to health and wellbeing in several countries of the world, most of them being urban or highly populated areas. Scientific investigations showed that exposure to air pollution can lead to an increased risk of developing or exacerbating several diseases, in particular respiratory and cardiovascular ones [1] . The prevalence of diseases such as asthma, type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disorders is also increasing in most of the world [2] [3] [4] . While public health organizations, together with non-profit associations and governments are struggling to apply \"green solutions\" to contain the increase in pollution levels, a sudden reduction of air pollutants concentration was observed in many countries between the end of the year 2019 and the year 2020. During this period, most of the productive activities throughout the world had to come to an unexpected stop due to the pandemic caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the related diseases, COVID-19. This virus was firstly reported in Wuhan, China, and quickly spread causing a high number of intense flu-like syndromes and cases of atypical pneumonia. Compared to influenza viruses, this unknown pathogen showed abnormally high contagious strength, with higher hospitalization and death risks [5] . Despite the initial efforts to contain the disease, the virus spread in several Asian countries outside of China, and at the end of February 2020 the first European case unrelated to the Asian outbreak was found in northern Italy, in the city of Codogno in Lombardy. In the following weeks, Italy suffered a tremendous increase in terms of COVID-19 cases, forcing the government to take drastic actions. Thus, Italy was the first western country to apply severe measures such as a general lockdown, with most of the population confined at home and a shutdown of all nonessential productive activities and services.",

Among other aspects, this area is known to be among the most polluted ones in Europe [6] , since several air pollutants, including particulate matter, often rise to dangerous levels. This phenomenon is due to an unfortunate combination of factors such as high population density, intense industrial activity and geographic position, as the valley is surrounded on three sides by mountains. Starting from China in December 2019, a reduction of human related pollution was observed in all areas where the lockdown was applied by governments. In several parts of the world air pollution dropped to the lowest levels in decades [7, 8] ; this happened particularly in Asian countries such as China and India. In Italy, although a similar effect has been observed, the reduction in terms of concentration was not evident for all pollutants. A significant decrease in nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide was observed during the first period, whereas no drop in particulate matter (PM 10 and PM 2.5 ) was recorded [9] . Peculiar meteorological conditions such as high concentration of sea salt and Saharan sand brought by Eastern winds at the beginning of the lockdown and a coincidental increase in the wind speed for several days could have contributed to this phenomenon [10] . Meteorological factors are known to play a considerable role in modulating particulate matter and other pollutants concentration: wind tends to disperse them, while lower or higher temperatures can create favorable conditions for higher concentrations. The presence of confounders makes it difficult to assess the real impact of traffic, industrial activities and house heating on the pollution levels, especially because they can potentially interact in complex ways. The sudden lockdown condition in which Italy entered between February and March 2020 allowed to analyze how vehicular traffic and factories activities impact on air pollution during the daily life. Although traffic was limited to essential transportations and factories not producing essential goods were closed during this period, results from studies were controversial due to the extreme variability in terms of weather condition typically characterizing the month of March [11] . Air pollution is a typical problem in the Po Valley during winter months [12] , when cold dense air tends to stagnate in the lower layers of the atmosphere. The phenomenon is less common in the warm season as air is less dense and local breezes are more frequent.",

A complex multi technological platform was created in the context of the PULSE project and tested in seven cities: Barcelona (Spain), Birmingham (United Kingdom), Keelung (Taiwan), New York (U.S.A.), Paris (France), Pavia (Italy) and Singapore.

The increase in terms of resolution can be beneficial to study phenomena of public health interest at a neighborhood level, thus taking into account social and health disparities that often characterize large urban environments, as highlighted by studies we performed in the context of the project [13, 14] . Despite this necessity, urban data is rarely collected with a sufficient spatial granularity, due to the high costs and difficulties of the process. Taking air quality as an example, pollution is usually measured by high quality monitoring stations deployed in the cities by official agencies or state departments. Being these instruments expensive and requiring constant maintenance they are usually deployed in small numbers. As an example, the entire city of New York has only 13 monitoring stations while Pavia has 2 stations over an area of about 65 km 2 . For this reason, low-cost and portable sensing technologies are becoming common [15] but generating controversial results: while the frequency and easiness of measurements increase with low-cost technology, the quality of the data collected is often limited.",

These instruments are easy to use as they can be installed on private apartments' balconies and require only a Wi-Fi connection and an electrical outlet. The unit price is relatively low (about $250), as they measure particulate matter using a simple laser counter, that has low production costs and requires low maintenance, although more prone to anomalous readings than more expensive technologies. The network created by these sensors was added to already existing official monitoring stations, property of ARPA Lombardia (Environmental Protection Regional Agency of the region of Lombardy), a public agency that aims at measuring environmental data in the Lombardy region in Italy-where Pavia is located.

Weather parameters are collected as well, and data is freely available upon request on a dedicated portal. An analysis has been performed to evaluate whether measurements performed by the Purple Air sensors were different from the ones performed by one of the official monitoring stations belonging to the local environmental agency ARPA. It was observed that, despite a small offset, the Purple Air sensors' measurements were highly correlated with the official ARPA ones (correlation > 0.9). Thanks to the large number of available devices, a dense sensors network was created, allowing to derive high-quality homogeneous maps through interpolation and to use them in the monitoring of pollution levels and personalized risk for the citizens that move around the city. Besides defining a spatially dense network, these sensors allow also for high temporal granularity in the measurements, by quantifying PM 1 , PM 2.5 , PM 10 ",

The continuous technological improvements in vehicular traffic and energetic efficiency are presumably leading to a slow decrease of average pollution levels in Europe, and this could be a confounding element in the evaluation of the lockdown effects using data from the previous year, since an observed reduction could be due to the general trend instead of the lockdown itself. According to data in literature and past articles, there is some evidence of a PM 10 and PM 2.5 reduction trend in all the area in the last years [19] although with notable fluctuations. Looking at an article published by the Italian National Environmental Protection System [20] , it can be noticed that the reduction trend appears less evident after 2018, with even a little increase, probably not significant, in the PM 10 concentrations in 2020. The article itself states that the meteorological variability could have played an important role in the measurements' variations, as in 2019 and 2020 temperatures were generally higher and precipitations lower than the previous years. Therefore, we assumed that the general trend characterizing the last years probably did not significantly influence the difference in PM concentrations between 2019 and 2020.",

Unadjusted mean and median variations showed conflicting trends of variations: discrepancies with respect to the adjusted mean variations could be partially explained by the non-gaussian distribution of PM measures variations during the different daily hours and by the lack of correction by confounders.",

For several weeks, most of the population was confined at home and all nonessential productive activities were closed. With these measures, a large part of the pollution sources was temporarily stopped, creating the ideal ground to perform scientific studies to verify whether the limitation of traffic and shutdown of some activities had an impact on global and local air pollution. A large number of studies aiming at analyzing these aspects were carried out throughout the world, with results varying depending on the geographical areas covered. Some reports showed a global reduction in several pollutants worldwide [21] , while other local-level studies obtained different results. Wang et al. [22] observed a significant reduction in all pollutants in 325 cities in China, especially in the northern cities, whereas Donzelli et al. [23] performed a similar analysis over a 7 months period for 3 cities in Tuscany, Italy, and reported different results depending on the pollutant (NO 2 levels changed significantly while PMs did not). A general study performed over western Europe performed by Menut et al. [24] taking into account also meteorological variables, showed a general reduction in terms of NO 2 throughout the continent, while the reduction in terms of PMs and O 3 was limited on a general level, but with pronounced local variations. Unlike other areas of the world, a severe reduction of all the pollutants during the lockdown in the Po Valley was not observed [9] , indicating that traffic may not have a huge impact on pollution and that meteorological conditions probably play a role even more important than what was usually thought.",

There are several advantages deriving from the availability of a dense sensors network, such as the possibility to monitor local conditions, estimate pollution levels in each neighborhood and to analyze temporal trends. The choice of the time period considered in the study (i.e., between February and April 2019 and 2020) was motivated by the fact that unique conditions were applied in that period in 2020, as the total lockdown that was instituted had no precedents and was never repeated in the following months. In fact, even if restrictions were kept throughout 2020, the same level of shutdown of all nonessential activities and limitation to all movements were never reached again.",

            "text": "The results of our study show mainly two aspects: first, as expected and already demonstrated in literature, the influence of climatic factors on PM levels is extremely high, second, considering this difference, there has been a mildly significant reduction in PM levels in 2020 during the lockdown, even though pollution levels remained relatively high even without traffic and most productive activities. The latter aspect suggests that most of the relevant pollution sources in this particular geographical area are represented by the heating systems in private houses and commercial traffic, and, even with only essential services active, the peculiar climatic conditions characterized by long periods without wind are able to create dangerous levels of pollution. One interesting result is that looking at the official ARPA data alone, there is not a clear decrease in the PM levels in 2020 if all meteorological variables are not taken into account, whereas there is a definite decrease considering other pollutants. This appears to be in line with other studies conducted over Italy such as [23] and [24] . Considering the variety of pollution sources and local environmental and meteorological situations, the reasons for this are not easy to explain, and a precise characterization of the main pollutants' sources is needed to understand these dynamics. For example, NO 2 is usually produced from anthropogenic emissions such as industrial burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas and vehicle exhaust [25] . A majority of the Particulate Matter, on the other hand, is formed from secondary formation, as PM is a generic measure that includes lots of different types of dusts, including soil residuals, sea salt, car pneumatics debris and all types of combustion processes residuals [26] , including those used in old house heating systems. Traffic, which is the main activity that was reduced during the lockdowns, contributes less to PMs than it does to other pollutants such as NO 2 . This could explain why PM did not have the same reduction other pollutants had. Part of the PM produced in the area of Pavia could come from the agriculture sector, as intensive agriculture is diffuse in all the surrounding areas of Pavia, and was not limited during the lockdown, being food production an essential service. House heating systems, especially older ones, could also be responsible to the limitation in decrease of PM levels, as during the lockdown, with people spending most of their time at home. It is likely that house heating was more needed than during the previous year, considering that the average temperature in 2020 was lower than the one in 2019. Increased house heating could partially explain also the change in the daily patterns that was observed during the lockdown, with a high peak in the first hours of the morning. This result in fact suggests a different behavior of different emission sources, primarily house heating, as there is a pollution increase in the coldest hours of the day, and people staying at home in 2020, together with a lower outside temperature compared to the previous year, probably led to a higher use of heating. On the other hand, during 2019, without lockdowns, the same morning hours were the so-called \"rush hours\", characterized by increased vehicular traffic, that probably leads to an increase in other pollutants and a more constant increase in PMs that reaches higher levels in the central hours of the day.",

These kinds of phenomena could be partly responsible for the absence of a significant decrease of pollution levels during the lockdown if meteorological factors are not taken into account, for example during the month of March 2020 there has been occasional eastern winds that brought some sea salt that could have increased PM levels [10] .",
