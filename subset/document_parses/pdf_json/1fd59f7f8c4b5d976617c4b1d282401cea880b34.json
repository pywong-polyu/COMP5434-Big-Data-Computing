At that time, cases were rapidly increasing in Washington, DC; \u2248200 cases had been reported since March 7. Although city officials ordered closure of nonessential businesses on March 24, FEMA remained open. To protect staff from severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, all persons entering FEMA headquarters underwent symptom and temperature screening. On April 5, after a cluster of 6 epidemiologically linked cases was identified, additional mitigation efforts were implemented, including requiring face masks at all times, requiring that a distance of 6 feet be maintained between employees, and reducing occupancy in the open office space building from a daily average of 1,300 to 400 persons.",

On average, participants had spent 20.5 (\u00b1 12.0 SD) days in the FEMA building since March 2020. We found no significant difference in workplace mitigation activities between seropositive and seronegative participants: 60.0% seropositive versus 60.5% seronegative participants used a face covering most of the time or always, 80.0% versus 76.3% maintained a distance of >6 feet from others most of the time or always, and 86.7% versus 91.1% washed their hands or used hand sanitizer >5 times per day. However, a higher, although not statistically significant, percentage of participants who shared a workspace were seropositive (13.3%) than seronegative (9.8%). The same was true for persons who spent >10 minutes <6 feet from someone who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in the FEMA building; 13.3% were seropositive and 10.2% were seronegative. A significantly higher percentage of seropositive participants lived with someone who had a confirmed positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 (13.3%) than those who were seronegative (0.7%).

This study identified 2 factors outside of the workplace that are potentially associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and transmission in the workplace (despite limited knowledge of whether infection occurred before or after potential exposure): residing with a household member with COVID-19 and using shared transportation. Although seroprevalence for SARS-CoV-2 antibodies was low among office workers, preventing workplace exposures to COVID-19 during March-April 2020 remained challenging. More than half of seropositive participants remained asymptomatic or were never tested for SARS-CoV-2, and 20%-40% of participants did not adhere to masking or physical distancing guidelines. This finding highlights the difficulties of adhering to mitigation efforts in the workplace and the importance of ensuring prevention efforts as persons return to work, such as engineering controls to reduce occupancy levels and modifying areas to maintain a distance of 6 feet between employees (3). Despite hazard controls implemented in the workplace, activities outside of work and noncompliance with mitigation efforts probably contributed to cases and small clusters of COVID-19 among office workers. However, seroprevalence remained at the same level as the overall 3.2% seroprevalence estimate for Washington, DC residents (4).",

We recorded all births and cases of microcephaly occurring during January 2006-December 2008 (Figure) . Most births in Libreville and its suburbs occur in these 2 hospitals; in addition, the hospitals receive newborns with malformations observed at birth who have been transferred from smaller healthcare facilities that lack neonatal departments. We collected most of the 4,312 samples from patients who visited these hospitals, so the 5 ZIKV case-patients likely lived in the 2 hospitals' coverage area.",

For male-born infants, microcephaly corresponded to a cranial circumference of <31.9 cm, and for female-born infants, a cranial circumference of <31.5 cm, measured <48 hours after birth.
