MR studies use randomly allocated genetic variants related to the exposure as instrumental variables for investigating the effect of the exposure on an outcome 16 . It is expected to be independent of confounding factors and has been demonstrated as an efficient and cost-effective strategy to identify causal effects 17 . Recent MR studies have provided evidence of causality for a range of risk factors on COVID-19 (Supplementary Data 1). For instance, BMI and smoking are associated with an increased COVID-19 risk, while no evidence of causal effects was found for circulating 25-hydroxy-vitamin-D levels [18] [19] [20] . However, inconsistent results were also reported for some factors, such as Alzheimer's disease, blood lipids, and physical activity 18, 19, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . Some of these inconsistencies are likely due to the usage of early genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of COVID-19, which have small sample sizes. Moreover, most studies are limited to a small number of candidate factors, leaving many more to be tested and identified. The recent release of large GWAS metaanalysis for various COVID-19 phenotypes offers a great opportunity for MR studies 27 . However, special care and caution are also needed when interpreting the results. Sampling from COVID-19 patients, individuals tested for infection, voluntary participants, or existing cohorts may result in nonrepresentative samples and induce collider bias that distorts phenotypic and genetic associations [28] [29] [30] . The inherent complexity of COVID-19 as an infectious disease and the potential complications in ascertaining cases and controls make it challenging to disentangle risk factors for an increased chance of infection, susceptibility to infection, and disease severity 27, 28 .",

All existing GWAS, as compiled by the Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) OpenGWAS project, were included 31, 32 . We note that some GWAS were on the same traits. In each of these GWAS, independent genetic variants at the genome-wide significance were selected as instrumental variables for the studied trait. The associations between genetic instruments and the risk of severe COVID-19 were evaluated based primarily on three nonindependent GWAS of COVID-19. The COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative (HGI) study A2 from release 4 alpha was used in our discovery analysis. HGI A2 compared COVID-19 patients with confirmed severe respiratory symptoms to population controls 27 . The HGI B2 study, comparing hospitalized COVID-19 patients to population controls, was used as one of our two replication datasets. The other replication dataset, labeled as the NEJM study, was drawn from the first published GWAS study of COVID-19 comparing patients with respiratory failure to healthy controls from Italy and Spain 33 . We note that due to sample overlap and different phenotypic definitions, the HGI B2 and NEJM studies are not independent or strict replications of HGI A2. They mainly serve the purpose of reducing false positives in our prioritized list of risk factors. To ensure the robustness of the prioritized list of risk factors, results based on these three COVID-19 GWAS were compared to those from different releases (4 alpha vs. 4 and 5), different case definitions (very severe respiratory COVID-19 in A2 and hospitalized COVID-19 in B2 vs. any reported infection in C2), and different control groups (population controls in A2 and B2 vs. nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients in A1 and B1). Furthermore, multiple sensitivity analyses were performed to detect and correct for the presence of pleiotropy in genetic instruments. Here, we only report associations that do not have evidence of pleiotropy in genetic instruments and are observed in at least one of the two primary replication analyses. As an indepth investigation into the BMI-related traits, we further conducted a multivariable MR analysis to disentangle the effects of fat mass and fat-free mass. Our findings provide profound insights into the etiology of severe COVID-19 and prioritize candidate causal risk factors for public health intervention and for drug discovery.",

Horizontal pleiotropy occurs when SNPs exert an effect on severe COVD-19 through other biological pathways independent of the studied exposure. To assess the presence of heterogeneity among genetic instruments, Cochran's Q statistic was calculated for heterogeneity for the IVW analyses 42 .

To account for pleiotropy, additional sensitivity analyses were performed with the MR-Egger 40,41 , weighted median (WM) 44 , and weighted-mode methods 45 . The MR-Egger method allows unbalanced horizontal pleiotropic effects even when all SNPs are invalid instruments 40 . The WM method can provide robust causal estimates when at least 50% of SNPs are valid genetic instruments, while the weighted-mode method reports the causal-effect estimate supported by the largest number of instruments 44, 45 .

Starting with the 34,519 GWAS compiled by the IEU OpenGWAS project, we focused on the 14,385 GWAS that are based on European-descent samples, in order to match the major ancestry in the GWAS of COVID-19 and to avoid false positives as results of population discrepancy in genetic effects. The details of traits and their GWAS included in our study are provided in Supplementary Data 3. From each GWAS, genetic instruments were selected as independent genetic variants at the genome-wide significance. Three or more genetic instruments are required for statistical tests of pleiotropic effects, and thus exposures with fewer instruments were excluded. For the univariable MR analysis of each exposure-outcome pair, we first applied the IVW method with a multiplicative random-effect model 39 . We then evaluated the possible presence of pleiotropic effects with Cochran's Q test of heterogeneity and the MR-Egger intercept test for directional pleiotropy 40, 42, 43 . We excluded all exposures with indications of pleiotropy in their genetic instruments to fulfill the key assumptions underlying MR analysis. We retained 1817 exposure GWAS for the discovery analysis with the HGI A2 study, 1740 for the replication analysis with the HGI B2 study, and 1915 for the replication analysis with the NEJM study (Supplementary Data 7). All retained traits have F statistics \u226510, indicating strong genetic instruments. The FDR approach was utilized in each MR analysis to correct for multiple testing of many exposures and to reduce false positives. Based on these three sets of analysis, we defined two sets of results: (1) the significant and replicated results, which have a q-value < 0.05 in the discovery analysis and BMI-related traits. In the univariable MR study, eight BMIrelated traits are positively associated with severe COVID-19 in our discovery analysis and also in both of our replication analyses (Supplementary Data 4). Genetically predicted one SD-increase of BMI is associated with a higher risk of severe COVID-19 (OR per SD increment: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.51-2.37, p = 3.15 \u00d7 10 \u22128 ) Fig. 1 The workflow of our extensive MR study for severe COVID-19.

These results suggest that our prioritized list of risk factors is robust to different data releases and control samples.",

LDSC analysis across these GWAS of different phenotype definitions and data releases revealed very high pair-wise genetic correlations, with the lowest r g of 0.85 between B2 and C2 (Supplementary Data 11) . For the 55 significant and replicated exposures prioritized in our primary analysis with A2 and B2, 39 were identified (p < 0.05) in MR analysis with at least one C2 GWAS from releases 4 and 5, suggesting that these factors may affect both susceptibility and severity ( Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Data 12 and 13) . Notably, BMI-related traits and fat mass fall in this category. There are 16 significant and replicated exposures that were not identified in any MR analysis with HGI C2 GWAS, suggesting that they may mainly affect disease severity (Supplementary Data 13) . For example, zincalpha-2-glycoprotein is associated with an increased risk of severe or hospitalized COVID-19 in our primary analysis with HGI A2 (OR: 1.37, 95% CI: 1.14-1.66), HGI B2 (OR: 1.24, 95% CI: 1.07-1.45), and NEJM (OR: 1.40, 95% CI: 1.08-1.82). But it has no association with the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection in analysis with HGI C2 from either release 4 (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.93-1.16) or release 5 (OR: 1.00, 95% CI: 0.91-1.09). Other notable severityrelated risk factors in this category include prostate-associated microseminoprotein, resistin, corneodesmosin, bradykinin, and C-C motif chemokine 23. On the other hand, there are 24 exposures that are significant (p < 0.05) in all three MR analyses with C2 GWAS, but not significant in our three primary MR analyses of severe COVID-19, suggesting that they may mainly affect susceptibility (Supplementary Data 13) . Notable factors in this category include rheumatoid arthritis, phospholipids in small VLDL, the concentration of small VLDL particles, and matrix metalloproteinase-9. Comparisons across different COVID-19 phenotypes suggest risk factors that may mainly affect susceptibility, severity, or both. However, due to the complexity of COVID-19 disease progression and the bias towards severe cases in most COVID-19 GWAS, we would like to emphasize the preliminary nature of this analysis and caution against overinterpretation.",

Using univariable MR, we first confirmed that BMI-related traits are putative causal risk factors for severe COVID-19. Our multivariable MR results further suggested that the effects of BMI-related traits might be driven by fat mass but not fat-free mass.

In terms of effect size, we found that one-SD increase of BMI was causally associated with a higher risk of very severe respiratory COVID-19 (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: For each specific blood-cell count, its GWAS ID in the Integrative Epidemiology Unit (IEU) OpenGWAS project was shown right after the exposure name. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) are scaled to a genetically predicted 1-standard-deviation (SD) increase in white blood cell trait. Two COVID-19 GWAS were shown. HGI A2 host genetics initiative study A2, HGI B2 host genetics initiative study B2. Associations with p-value < 0.05 were indicated with diamonds, while others with squares. Error bars stand for 95% CI. Detailed summary statistics could be found in Supplementary Data 6. 50 . Our MR estimates are consistent with observational estimates, while the minor differences may reflect different phenotype definitions and the impacts of confounding factors in observational associations. Furthermore, our multivariable MR analysis further showed that fat mass is a causal risk factor for severe COVID-19, while fat-free mass is not. These results suggest that the causal effect of BMI on severe COVID-19 is likely driven by fat mass. The causal effects of BMI and fat mass have plausible biological mechanisms. Fat mass has been known to have deleterious effects on lung function, inflammation, and immunity [51] [52] [53] . In adipose tissue, high production of circulating proinflammatory cytokines and adipokines may intensify virally induced inflammation and immune dysregulation, and contribute to acute respiratory distress syndrome, which is the leading cause of mortality from COVID-19 [54] [55] [56] [57] . Notably, other causal risk factors of severe COVID-19 identified in this study are also related to adiposity, including glucosamine, resistin, prostate-associated microseminoprotein, and zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . These connections suggest a shared mechanism for their contribution to severe COVID-19. Therefore, further mechanistic understanding of fat mass and other related risk factors will shed light on the etiology of severe COVID-19 and provide multiple targets of intervention for prevention and treatment.",

In addition to direct evidence from neutrophils, sum basophil-neutrophil counts and sum neutrophil-eosinophil counts are directly related to neutrophils, and concordant causal effects were obtained using multiple MR methods. We also identified myeloid white blood cell counts and granulocyte counts as being inversely associated with the risk of severe COVID-19, which is consistent with our previous MR findings 63 . In contrast to the negative associations in this MR study, previous observational studies have provided strong evidence that elevated white blood cells and neutrophils but depleted lymphocytes are common in COVID-19 patients [64] [65] [66] [67] . This discrepancy highlights the possibility that observed associations are due to confounding and reverse causation. The causal role of neutrophils in preventing the development of severe COVID-19 has biological support. Neutrophils, the integral components of the innate immune system, are the first line of defense against invading pathogens 68 . Moreover, neutrophils participate in elaborate cell-signaling networks involving cytokines, chemokines, survival, and growth factors that cause downstream proinflammatory effects 69 . On the other hand, neutrophils are involved in the hyperinflammatory responses (e.g., overproduction of neutrophil extracellular traps and cytokine storm) in severe COVID-19 patients. This reflects the reverse causal effect of COVID-19 on neutrophils 70, 71 . Overall, our present results support the potential causal effects of white blood cells, especially neutrophils, on severe COVID-19, likely through an enhanced immune response that suppresses virus infection in the early stage.",

To ensure robustness and reduce false positives, we only reported results that were replicated in at least one replication analysis. Another strength is that we applied multivariable MR analyses to evaluate the independent causal effects of fat mass and fat-free mass. To ensure reproducibility and to encourage open science, we have released our computational pipeline. As a demonstration of the readiness of this pipeline, in the manuscript revision phage, we included additional analysis based on GWAS from HGI releases 4 and 5. We encourage readers to use our pipeline to update results for future HGI releases or for new risk factors from the IEU OpenGWAS database. Comparing our primary analysis based on HGI release 4 alpha to results from releases 4 and 5 demonstrates the high robustness of our prioritized list of risk factors. Additionally, comparing our primary analysis based on severe forms of COVID-19 to results based on any SARS-CoV-2 infection distinguishes risk factors that may mainly impact the susceptibility to infection, the severity of disease progression, or both processes.",

First, our two-sample MR analysis inherits many of the limitations and complications of the COVID-19 GWAS, which meta-analyzed studies with very heterogeneous designs, ascertainment and phenotyping of cases, and sources of control samples. Although significant efforts have been spent in enhancing the robustness of genetic findings and many loci have been shown to be biologically meaningful 27 , the usage of nonrepresentative convenience samples may induce collider bias that distorts phenotypic and genetic associations [28] [29] [30] . Second, although we applied multiple sensitivity analyses in our MR analysis, including the heterogeneity test, MR-Egger, and WM method, we could not fully rule out the possibility that some genetic variants might be pleiotropic. Another approach to test the assumptions of independence and no horizontal pleiotropy is to examine known associations with potential confounders or other phenotypes using databases such as PhenoScanner 47, 48 . We performed an exemplary lookup and validation for six exposures that have a small number of genetic instruments (the five significant and doubly replicated circulating proteins in Supplementary Fig. 4 and glucosamine supplementation in Supplementary Fig. 3 ). No associations with confounders were observed, but four exposures have instruments associated with either blood cell or BMI-related traits, suggesting potential horizontal pleiotropy (Supplementary Data 14) . After excluding these genetic instruments, the effects of three exposures remain significant (p < 0.05, Supplementary Data 15). Therefore, this manual examination of six exposures with PhenoScanner supports the effects of five, while that of interleukin-3 receptor subunit alpha may be explained by horizontal pleiotropy. Similar in-depth analysis could be performed in follow-up studies on other exposures of interest. Third, another limitation of our study is that some GWAS of exposures and the HGI GWAS of COVID-19 have overlapped samples, especially those from the UK Biobank. This sample overlap may induce bias in MR estimates. Strong instruments for the instrument-exposure association are less susceptible to this bias and all traits included in our analysis have strong instruments (F > 10). To mitigate this issue, we also utilized another GWAS of COVID-19, the NEJM study, which does not have overlapping samples with exposure GWAS. Fourth, the three COVID-19 GWAS used in our primary analysis, the HGI A2, HGI B2, and NEJM study, have overlapped cases and therefore do not represent independent replications. Their inclusion in our study design may help reduce false positives in our final list of prioritized risk factors.",

While this practice increases statistical power with much larger controlsample sizes, it may also introduce biases in case ascertainment and thus genetic associations. It is somewhat reassuring that our sensitivity analysis with the HGI A1 and B1 GWAS, which utilized nonhospitalized COVID-19 patients as the control, also observed most of the prioritized risk factors. Sixth, while our primary analysis focuses on GWAS of severe COVID-19, the prioritized risk factors may increase the susceptibility to viral infection or exacerbate disease progression upon infection. Our attempt to distinguish susceptibility-related from severity-related risk factors by including analysis with GWAS of any COVID-19 (HGI C2) is complicated by the fact that the case definition for any COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2 infection is biased toward severe cases. Further mechanistic research is required to decipher the biological pathways underpinning the effects of these prioritized risk factors on COVID-19. Seventh, a further weakness is that the statistical power for some exposures was limited, and some null results might be false negatives. Further positive findings may be revealed if more GWAS with larger sample sizes become available. Eighth, as an effort to reduce complications from population stratification, our study focuses on European ancestry, and thus the findings may not be generalizable to other ethnicities.",

Our findings suggest that neutrophils, granulocytes, and myeloid white blood cells are inversely associated with the severe COVID-19 risk. Our study also identifies putatively causal associations between scores of circulating proteins and severe COVID-19. These findings provide valuable insights into the etiology of severe COVID-19. These prioritized risk and protective factors could potentially serve as drug targets and guide the effective protection of high-risk populations.",
