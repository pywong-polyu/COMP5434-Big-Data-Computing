(80 words max.)-Our study shows that among women diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta was more frequent among women suffering from preeclampsia or gestational hypertension. Moreover, we find that more severe hypertensive disorders were associated with higher viral load in placenta. We identify several cases of placental SARS-CoV-2 positivity at delivery (RT-PCR) in women who have tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 after an initial COVID-19 episode. \u2022 What are the main clinical implications? (80 words max.)-SARS-CoV-2 infection could trigger pathophysiological pathways that could favor the development of hypertensive disorders. The presence of viral load in the placenta weeks after the infection, accompanied by hypertensive disorders, could be considered as a form of chronic COVID-19. We should take this information into account when controlling pregnant women after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Methods: This is a case-control study in women with and without gestational hypertensive disorders after SARS-CoV-2 infection diagnosed by RT-PCR during pregnancy. Patients were matched by gestational age at the moment of COVID-19 diagnosis. We performed an analysis of SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels in placenta. Results: A total of 28 women were enrolled. Sixteen patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 during the third trimester and the remaining 12 patients in the other trimesters. Ten placentas (35.7%) were positive for SARS-CoV-2, 9 of them (9/14, 64.3%) belonged to the HDP group versus 1 (1/14, 7.2%) in the control group (p = 0.009). Those cases with the highest loads of viral RNA developed severe preeclampsia (PE). Conclusion: Among women diagnosed with COVID-19 during pregnancy, the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta was more frequent among women suffering from PE or gestational hypertension. Furthermore, the most severe cases of HDP were associated with high placental viral load, not necessarily associated with a positive nasopharyngeal RT-PCR at delivery. Our data suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy could trigger gestational hypertensive disorders through persistent placental infection and resulting placental damage.",

            "text": "The clinical manifestations of the SARS-CoV-2 infection support a key role for endothelial dysfunction in the pathobiology of this condition. SARS-CoV-2 infection induces an endotheliitis in different organs as a direct consequence of viral infection and the host inflammatory response [8, 9] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is the major cellular-entry receptor for SARS-CoV-2 virus [10] . Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 is present prominently in the alveoli, but also in endothelial cells, which can be directly infected by the virus [11] . Besides, cytokine release syndrome can also drive endothelial damage independently [12] . Consequently, a distinctive feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular harm, with severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis, and microangiopathy, in response to endothelial damage. Therefore, endothelial dysfunction seems to be the pathophysiological substrate for severe It is at present unknown how COVID-19 is associated with increased frequency of HDP (and especially PE) and whether similar mechanisms operate. COVID-19-associated PE-like disease may be an indirect result of maternal disease or more directly related to the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta. While initial studies had suggested that SARS-CoV-2 invades the placenta in some cases [13] [14] [15] , posterior data suggest that it is not very common [16] [17] [18] [19] . Consistent with a low frequent presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta [20] , vertical transmission is rather infrequent [21] ; a systematic review reported a rate of 3.2% vertical transmission in mothers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (diagnosed by RT-PCR) during the third trimester of pregnancy [22] . A recent study of placentas taken from COVID-19-positive mothers [23] describes a low-level presence of RNA in about half of placentas. No substantial histopathological, maternal, or neonatal outcome features were detected associated with this low level of viral RNA. However, a high SARS-CoV-2 RNA level was detected in only one patient, who exhibited severe placental injury in the form of extensive fibrin deposition, necrosis of the syncytiotrophoblast layer of the villi and apoptosis. This observation fits the hypothesis that only limited placental pathology is associated with COVID-19, except for cases with very high SARS-CoV-2 RNA levels, the latter indicative of high viral load.",

Information on these test kits are listed in online supplementary Table 1 (for all online suppl. material, see www.karger.com/doi/10.1159/000520179). As suggested by the manufacturer for nasopharyngeal specimens, cycle threshold (CT) values below 37 were taken as positive. Besides, all women who were hospitalized for delivery were screened for SARS-CoV-2 infection using RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs shortly before giving birth. However, in the case of pregnant women who had already overcome the infection, RT-PCR was only performed around delivery if the latest negative RT-PCR test was more than 3 months ago. As a result, 4 patients (3, 4, 15, and 16) were not tested for SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of delivery. Prophylactic treatment with low molecular weight heparin for 14 days was applied to COVID-19 women diagnosed by RT-PCR [24] . COV-ID-19 has been divided into 3 types [25] : asymptomatic infection refers no clinical symptoms or signs; mild infection refers to symptoms such as fever, cough, headache, anosmia and asthenia; and severe infection refers dyspnea, hypoxemia accompanied by chest imaging compatible with pneumonia and respiratory infection.",

In contrast, among the corresponding 6 control cases without HDP, only 1 tested positive for placental SARS-CoV-2 (Table 2) . It is possible therefore that the continued presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta promotes HDP. Moreover, out of 10 pregnancies with these early SARS-CoV-2 infections for which data are available, only 1 mother remained positive at delivery (N\u00ba 6), while 7 placentas tested positive.

Gestation of normal course until onset of fever, cough, and malaise, with positive result in RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 (CT: 20.2) at 38 + 3 weeks of gestation. The patient presented blood pressure around 150/90 mm Hg, with positive creatinine protein ratio and pneumonia on chest Xray that required treatment with low molecular weight heparin, steroids, and oxygen therapy. Laboratory tests were performed in week 38 + 4, HELLP syndrome was detected (59,000 mm 3 platelets, LDH 443 U/L and GOT 43 U/L), and it was decided to elective delivery at that time by caesarean section due to HELLP and breech presentation. The birth weight of the first male twin was 2,820 g, with the APGAR test 6 and 8 at 1 and 5 min, respectively. The birth weight of the second male twin was 2,840 g, the APGAR test was 2 and 8 at 1 and 5 min, re-spectively. Both were admitted to the neonatal unit and the mother had no contact with the newborns after the caesarean section. RT-PCR SARS-CoV-2 was performed on both, positive at 3 and 2 days of life, respectively, as well as SARS-CoV-2 serologies, which were positive at 19 and 16 days of life, respectively. The analysis of the placenta yielded a clear positive result for SARS-CoV-2 (CT 15.1) [6] .",

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta has been studied in the context of horizontal transmission of the virus [22] with an early study reporting 7.7% positivity (2/26). However, only a very limited number of studies report data that allow a direct comparison between the placental presence of SARS-CoV-2 and HDP. An early prospective cohort study [16] describes the inability to detect SARS-CoV-2 in the placenta by RNA in situ hybridization in 44 women with SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis in the third trimester. Afterward, since the first report describing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 fetal membrane samples [32] , similar reports have followed. Hosier et al. [33] mention high viral load in the placenta (CT <16) of a single woman with severe PE and SARS-CoV-2 infection during the late second trimester of pregnancy. In a posterior study, a rate of 47% SARS-CoV-2-positive placenta tissue was reported in 21 women who were diagnosed (using RT-PCR) between 35 and 40 weeks of gestation [23] . In this latter study, a woman who exhibited severe placental damage delivered a baby with neurological manifestations. Based on these combined 2 cases, the possibility was raised that the severity of SARS-CoV-2-mediated placental pathology might be directly related to placental SARS-CoV-2 viral load.",

Out of 28 samples tested in our study, we identified 10 placental tissue samples that tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (35.7% of total), 9 of them belonging to the HDP group. We observed that, among patients with SARS-CoV-2 infection during gestation, the frequency of a positive placental SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test was much high-SARS-CoV-2 Viral Load in the Placenta of Patients with Hypertensive Disorders 9 Fetal Diagn Ther DOI: 10.1159/000520179 er in the HDP group than the non-HDP group. Furthermore, we detected that the percentage of cases with a positive placental SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test trend differently between PE and AHT (p = 0.065). In fact, the 3 most severe cases of PE (cases N\u00ba 1, 11 and 23), showed higher placental viral load than all the others. Moreover, each of the 3 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in a different trimester of gestation. It has been argued that localization of SARS-CoV-2 to fetal cells such as the syncytiotrophoblast as opposed to maternal uterine cells requires detection by immunohistochemistry or RNA in situ hybridization [16] . We only applied RT-PCR and can therefore not exclude that the placenta samples we have analyzed do contain maternal tissue. Considering that maternal tissue was avoided when taking samples, and for the sake of simplicity, we interpret positive placental RT-PCR results as representative of viral load in villous placenta. This might indicate that in women susceptible to HDP, the presence of placental SARS-CoV-2 may contribute to the severity of the disorder. We suggest that a relationship between a higher viral load in placenta tissue and the severity of the hypertensive disorder deserves consideration.",

Further studies with a large number of patients are required to confirm the association between high SARS-CoV-2 viral load in placenta tissue and the development of HDP. Moreover, our hospital's protocols changed as the pandemic progressed. Therefore, different methodologies have been used for viral RNA detection. As not all tests proved to be equally sensitive and specific, the use of distinct tests may have caused a discrepancy with studies published previously [13, 16, 22] . In addition, we do not have sequencing data from nasopharyngeal maternal swabs available, but all pregnant women were diagnosed before the alpha (B.1.1.7 UK) variant and delta (B.1.617.2 India) were routinely detected in our area. A final limita-tion to address is the fact that for each placenta, we tested only a single sample. As SARS-CoV-2 is not necessarily homogenously present (or absent) throughout the placenta, the identification of samples as positive or negative should be interpreted in this context.",

Besides, as a SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test carried out at the time of birth showed all mothers tested negative, we could rule out the possibility of acute maternal infection during delivery. Some cases we describe with high placenta SARS-CoV-2 levels, specifically patient 1 and patient 11, had negative RT-PCR results at the time of delivery.

We find that the presence of SARS-CoV-2 (although we do not formally prove viral infection) was more frequent in the placentas of those in the HDP group than in the placentas of COVID-19 mothers without HDP. We detect placental RNA representative of SARS-CoV-2 infection at high levels in a limited number of PE cases, and at lower levels in about 25% of placentas from COVID-19 positive mothers. There are different ways in which the infant of a RT-PCR-positive mother could be affected by SARS-CoV-2: maternal inflammation and endothelial damage may be transmitted to the placenta in the form of cytokines which might modulate the fetal immune system [43] . Alternatively, SARS-CoV-2 infection of the placenta may directly influence the fetal environment. The presence of placental viral RNA needs to be investigated in a much larger cohort to clarify if and in what frequency if SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy does trigger gestational hypertensive disorders through placenta-related mechanisms. Our work contributes to the understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 virus affects pregnancy, which includes the possibility that placental infection contributes to pregnancy complications. Better and more detailed understanding of the placental disease process may aid or could be essential for appropriate monitoring during pregnancy and providing appropriate postnatal care.",
