Many of these improvements have been broad strokes interventions, such as removing lead from gasoline and paint, improvements in occupational health and safety, improving water quality and ensuring food safety, affecting the majority of people in the US [1, 2] . Yet, health disparities persist [3, 4] , and the field is increasingly faced with complex challenges of historically rooted structural determinants of health. These challenges include a lack of socio-historical context, misalignment between community and researcher goals [5] , insufficient data granularity and interventions that address specific downstream symptoms rather than root causes of problems [4] . Scientificgrade youth participatory action research (YPAR) studies can help address this gap by leveraging youth's experiential expertise to fine tune scientific data collection protocols for context-specific scenarios, building relationships between researchers and community, collecting nuanced neighborhood level data responsive to local needs [6] , framing findings in local vernacular and contexts, and disseminating results more effectively. In recruiting youth from impacted communities and providing them with mentorship, afterschool educational opportunities, skills development, paid work, college preparation and amplifying 2 of 18 their voices, YPAR can help dismantle long-standing power dynamics [7] . The model prioritizes centering impacted communities, building local capacity and expanding future opportunities for improved wellbeing [8] [9] [10] .",

Researchers from UC Berkeley's Center for Environmental Research and Children's Health (CERCH) partnered with RYSE, a community youth center in Richmond promoting social justice and development opportunities. The project facilitated empowerment among high school youth through: (1) training in environmental health literacy (EHL), professional development, paid employment and college preparation; (2) full partnership in designing and conducting research on the convergence of structural air pollution and community-level health risk factors using both quantitative and qualitative methods; and (3) interpretation of findings, community outreach and advocacy. Youth were facilitated in exploring manifestations of structural violence, explicitly examining features in the built environment that may affect pollution levels in correlation with pre-existing socio-economic burdens, monitoring for disparities in NO 2 , SO 2 and noise pollution and returning results to the community.",

Exposure during pregnancy is associated with low birthweight, premature birth and infant mortality [13] . The vast majority of those most impacted are low-income people of color [12] . Air pollution also presents a significant threat to planetary health, with emissions exceeding earth's absorption rate, risking global warming, mass extinctions and ecological collapse. The health effects of air pollutants among sub-groups with heightened biological susceptibility and vulnerability remains understudied. Susceptible sub-groups include the very young, the very old, those with respiratory diseases and those who face high levels of socio-economic disadvantage and other chronic social stressors. Emerging findings indicate that air pollution may exacerbate both the incidence and harm of COVID-19 [14, 15] , a disease that disproportionately affects communities of color [16, 17] .",

Concerning monitoring and human health effects, the most widely studied air pollutants include particulate matter (PM), ozone (O 3 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ), and sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ) [18] . NO 2 can contribute to PM2.5 and ozone air pollution respectively, and is associated with increased risk of pulmonary distress and asthma symptom exacerbation [18] . SO 2 is the leading cause of acid rain, which is devastating to ecological balance and is associated with respiratory distress, exacerbation of respiratory disease symptoms, increases in overall mortality and cardiac disease hospitalizations in humans [18] . Emissions generating activities are largely driven by commodity production, transportation and participation in growth-focused global markets, and include stationary sources such as heavy production industries and mobile sources such as trucks and trains. Though mobile sources are transient by nature, they generally follow well-established routes, resulting in clusters of heightened emissions.",

Examples include Western colonist's attempted genocide against Native Americans and forced relocation to reservations on \"marginal\" land [24] , Trans-Atlantic slavery, and racial segregation in the early 20th century. In each instance, extreme force was used to establish boundaries, cordoning low income and people of color, and policing behaviors. In the face of resistance, explicit force transitioned to more insidious mechanisms such as withheld GI-Bill housing and education support for Black veterans of WWII [25] , economic divestment and race-based exclusion via redlining [26] , racially biased federal loan practices favoring white farmers [27] , and the mass incarceration of people of color [28] . Here, the opportunities that groups of people are held back from, and the spaces they are held in, engrained in replicating and obfuscated structures, become violence.",

Over the last decade, Occupy/Decolonize Wallstreet, #MeToo and Black Lives Matter have focused on mitigating harm in relation to economic disadvantage, gender discrimination and racism respectively. In 2020, George Floydraised in a low-income, single-mother household, and a Black man-was killed by police in an egregious act of violence [48] . Though complex, research indicates a strong connection between being low income (male) and Black, and higher probability of police arrest, imprisonment [49] , and police violence, with police force being a leading cause of death for young Black men [50] . Re-energized by the pursuit of justice for Floyd, as well as for many before and after him, the Black Lives Matter movement has become the largest US social movement to date [51] . The movement is rooted in resistance throughout deep histories of slavery and continuing racial injustice. Many such injustices have been overt and acute for 400 years. With advances in video recording and communications technology, contemporary manifestations of these historically rooted injustices can now be transmitted, and better articulated, almost instantaneously across vast networks, perhaps therefore increasing societal level engagement. The \"slow death\" of oftentimes invisible, gradual, and mechanistically complex air pollution exposures, frequently the result of unintended and indirect forces, oftentimes manifest in a holding back and a holding within marginalized \"geographies of harm\", stand in contrast. Aptly stated by Foucault, in a distinct but complementary context \"... invisibility is a guarantee of order [52] .\" Noteworthy also, is that George Floyd, deprived of his \"freedom to breathe [53]\" by state violence, was also diagnosed with COVID-19 [48] , itself an airborne respiratory disease disproportionately burdening low income and communities of color in the US, and potentially exacerbated by air pollution. Implications, including potential synergies between increasing public awareness around Black Lives Matter, disparities in the effects of COVID-19, and improved environmental justice are overviewed in the Discussion section.",

Roughly 17,000 people reside in the neighborhoods of Atchison Village and North Richmond, census tracts ranking in the top 90-95th percentile statewide for combined socio-economic and pollution burden [60] . The population in these tracts is >92% non-white, with asthma burdens in the 99-100th percentiles, and diesel burdens in the 84-95th [60] . Richmond houses the largest oil refinery west of the Mississippi, the cause of several air pollution emergencies in recent years including one that hospitalized 15,000 residents [61] , resulting in great concern among many in the community. Previous community-based participatory research revealed that air toxics concentrations, as well as the variety of air toxics, were substantially higher in Richmond than a neighboring, predominantly white and more formally educated community [62] . Richmond faces a violent crime rate almost twice as high as the surrounding county and state as a whole [63] . While 15% of those over 25 years of age in the US do not have a high school diploma, this proportion is 32% or higher in impacted Richmond census tracts, as high as 58% [64] . Physical activity and access to healthy foods are major challenges as well, with nearly half of the population obese or overweight and nearly a third living in food deserts [65] .",

Because the primary goal of regulatory monitoring is to assess whether a region's overall pollution levels fall within air quality standards, these networks are ill-suited to examine spatial heterogeneity of air pollution levels within cities. Though several of Richmond's neighborhoods are impacted by emissions from heavy industry and multiple highways, the city has just one regulatory air monitoring site that measures criteria air pollutants regulated by the US EPA (e.g., NO 2 , SO 2 , PM2.5, ozone, and carbon monoxide). Consequently, little is known about differences in air pollution levels between Richmond neighborhoods. Such limitations leave densely populated areas with potentially insufficient air quality data, which could otherwise guide policymakers in prioritizing local air pollution mitigation efforts. The spatially dense network of air samplers implemented in our study enabled youth researchers to better characterize spatial variability of air pollutant concentrations between Richmond neighborhoods and associate this variability with features of the built environment, many of which exemplify continuing structural violence.",

Through lifetimes of experience in affected communities, locals gain invaluable insight into mechanisms behind key challenges, intersectional harms and assets to address them. This process of engagement frequently reveals unforeseen synergies between organizations, community members and researchers. The \"gold standard\" model for community researcher partnerships is Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR). CBPR emphasizes strengths-based engagement, equitable community inclusion in all facets of research, co-learning between academics and community members, equitable distribution of resources, local capacity building, research and action, addressing local priorities, and sustained engagement [69] . CBPR improves \"relevance, rigor and reach\" [70] . Community input guides study foci and ensures relevance to community needs. Rigor is improved as residents have experiential expertise and can highlight contexts affecting local exposure or vulnerability. Locals may be perceived as more trustworthy than outsider researchers and granted greater access to sensitive information or culturally significant locations. CBPR enhances the reach of findings, as locals know how to frame results using appropriate language that appeals to those most affected, and ideal venues for dissemination [70] .",

Together, we determined the following air quality and emissions source indicators: neighborhood differences in NO 2 and SO 2 concentrations; major roadway density for 250 and 500 m circular buffers around each sampling site; roadway density and pollutant concentrations around sampling sites; railway density in 250 and 500 m circular buffers; greenspace (normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI)) in 250 and 500 m buffers; and federally regulated air emissions site density in 250 and 500 m buffers. To assess possible differences in cumulative impacts of air and noise pollution measurements, and emissions sources, summary scores were computed for the different indices. For example, the summary score for emissions sources was computed by first computing a Z-score for the density of each type of emission source indicator and summing these values for each sampling site. Univariable and multivariable linear regressions were used to determine the relationships between emission source indicators (e.g., roadway density within 250 m) and air pollutant concentrations.",

For context, during the same timeframe of our study, the average NO 2 concentration measured in our study (12. 09 ppb) is similar to the average measurements made at the nearest U.S. EPA monitoring station (13.24 ppb) that is located in the neighboring City of San Pablo. For SO 2 , however, measurements made in our study were not similar to the nearest US EPA ambient SO 2 monitoring station (see Table 1 ). Figure 1 displays spatial locations of each of the 12 air sampling sites. Significant differences in neighborhood ambient NO 2 concentrations were observed (Figure 2 ), with a significantly lower level of NO 2 observed for sites in North Richmond. Linear regression models indicated higher levels of greenspace (NDVI) were significantly associated with lower concentrations of NO 2 (Supplement; Figure S3 ). Greenspace within 250-500 m of sites explained 73% (p-value < 0.001) and 71% (p-value < 0.001) of NO 2 variability, respectively. The spatial density of railroads within 250 m (R 2 = 0.45; p-value = 0.02) and major roadway density within 500 m (R 2 = 0.32; p-value = 0.055) were associated with higher NO 2 concentrations. Noise levels were also positively associated with NO 2 concentrations (R 2 = 0.30, p-value = 0.08). While aggregate NO 2 concentrations showed little correlation with the density of industrial emissions sites, the site with the highest concentrations of NO 2 (14.9 ppb) was closest to a major oil refinery and was 12% higher than the NO 2 measurements from the nearest U.S. EPA ambient air quality monitoring station in San Pablo. Concentrations of SO 2 did not show significant associations with spatial features, with noise levels, or between neighborhoods. As suggested in Figure 3 , census tracts with the highest Non-Hispanic Black populations (south of Atchison) experienced the highest NO 2 concentrations, the highest levels of cumulative air and noise pollution levels, and the highest cumulative density of emissions sources. In addition, tracts south of Atchison with the highest proportion of non-Hispanic Blacks had the lowest levels of neighborhood greenness (Supplement Figure S3 ). Refer to the Supplement (Supplement Figures S1-S3) for further spatial distributions of densities and built environment features considered. We note that although we conducted only spot measurements of sound levels at our monitoring sites, the average site decibel levels recorded in our study exceeded the City of Richmond's noise ordinance limits for exterior noise for every zoning type except for Heavy and Marine Industrial Zones (the highest zoned area for noise).

Significant differences in neighborhood ambient N concentrations were observed (Figure 2 ), with a significantly lower level of NO2 observ for sites in North Richmond.

As youth were applying to college, extra workshops were offered on college application personal statement writing, key dates, and application tips. Youth were given the option of submitting their statements to staff for review and provided with extensive feedback. Youth were also invited to tour UC Berkeley and attended a panel with UC Berkeley undergraduate students of color who spoke about their experiences and provided tips. All youth were accepted to, and attended, leading universities. Verbally, 60% expressed that because of this program they would major in environmental studies or environmental science. The remaining 40% expressed they planned to integrate lessons learned about environmental health into their fields of study. 100% applied to external summer employment opportunities that related to environmental health and 40% were able to secure paid employment, directly addressing air quality concerns. To date, staff have been able to support 40% of youth in obtaining additional paid placements with environmental health organizations and 60% in presenting to graduate level classes. Though these were not explicit study objectives, they reflect the spirit of participatory research, where researchers take measures to support capacity and facilitate opportunities to access important resources. We recommend that researchers engaging in participatory research take similar measures to ensure organic and iterative support beyond explicit study aims, especially those with the privileges associated with being part of an academic institution, with advanced credentials or with otherwise high socio-economic status.

These correlations were in the expected directions (e.g., railways were positively correlated with NO 2 ). Possible cumulative impacts were also observed in our study. Noise levels were correlated with higher levels of NO 2 , suggesting that communities experiencing higher NO 2 levels are doubly burdened with noise pollution. Sampled census tracts with the highest proportion of Non-Hispanic Blacks experienced the highest levels of NO 2 . Again, this suggests that Non-Hispanic Blacks, a historically marginalized group, may be doubly exposed to higher levels of air pollution and social stressors compared to other Richmond communities monitored in our study. Greenspace was significantly associated with lower NO 2 concentrations and was also the strongest predictor of NO 2 . This suggests that greenspace may mitigate some air quality concerns. Moreover, greenspace has been shown in other studies to be conducive to improvements in physical activity [84, 85] and real estate value [86, 87] , thus investment may address multiple symptoms of structural violence. Research further indicates that greenspace may have positive impacts on a range of human health factors [88, 89] .

It has been estimated that the economic value of eliminating health disparities more broadly is in the trillions of dollars [91] with savings from eliminating racial health disparities specifically estimated in the hundreds of billions to trillions over time [92] .

Combined, aspects of CBPR resonate with the concept of Strong Objectivity [96] , that scientific fields require increased, and innately subjective, reflection and diverse inclusion in order to acknowledge, address, and control for, human researcher's implicit biases, thus improving aggregate objectivity. Greater diversity fosters a broader variety of subjectivities that can then cancel out, acknowledge, or balance biases implicit in demographics currently overrepresented in STEM fields.

Diversification of STEM adds a multitude of perspectives and approaches, increasing the probability that new and effective interventions will be developed. Inclusion of marginalized folks may lend a more nuanced understandings of how structural violence and social determinants of health function, as these populations have familiarity with their impacts. Fostering marginalized group's attainment of educational and employment opportunities remediates factors associated with increased chances of bearing environmental burdens. Thus, diversification is both a means to better data and interventions, and end in itself, reducing the probability of structural harm and improving the probability of developmental success.

Several have also worked to foster youth mentorship, college preparedness and diversifying STEM fields for the next generation.",

First, our air sampling took place during a three-week period starting 21 December 2017 and ending in mid-January 2018. Therefore, our findings are generalizable only to the time period sampled and do not capture seasonal variations of air pollutant levels. That being said, we note that NO 2 concentrations measured with the Ogawa samplers were very similar when compared against NO 2 measurements made at the nearest US EPA ambient air quality-monitoring site (see Table 1 ). This finding gives added external validity to our NO 2 measurements. We are less confident about the external validity for SO 2 since SO 2 levels measured were at least an order of magnitude lower than the nearest US EPA air monitoring site. We note that the two Ogawa samplers in closest proximity to the US EPA monitoring site were at least at the same order of magnitude of SO 2 concentrations (0.12 ppb versus 0.43 ppb). However, SO 2 observations made in our study must be interpreted with caution. Further, due to lack of resources, noise measurements were made using spot checks only and do not represent 24 h measurements, as is typically done. However, our spot measurements indicated rather high levels of ambient noise at each site location. These preliminary findings warrant further investigation and follow up.",

By further naming, contextualizing, and quantifying deleterious patterns of environmental disparities, these phenomena are more clearly revealed to be artificial, abnormal, and requiring redress. It is our hope that environmental health disparities, and broader awareness of intersectional structural violence, may be increasingly incorporated into social movements, as well as policy decisions. The imperative nature of issues discussed is exacerbated by the devastation COVID-19 has had, and continues to have, especially on communities of color, and especially among communities exposed to air pollution. In this regard, we encourage researchers to expand their commitment to community based participatory research and contextualize findings within historical and contemporary violence. Participatory models help generate more granular data and more efficiently render meaningful results that are actionable for multidimensional interventions, informed by deeper understandings of how structural violence, and eco-apartheid interact to probabilistically determine built and social environments that deeply affect community member's health. Through YPAR, youth bring a fresh, often marginalized, perspective and hope, helping researchers and communities reify why efforts for improved health equity are of paramount importance, beyond data and abstraction. If properly conducted, the practice of community inclusion helps erode unbalanced power dynamics and socio-economic inequities, improves the long-term sustainability of actions within affected communities, and bolsters capacity to push for a healthier future. Exceeding public health as it is often bound, this may be more conducive to a collective belonging and public healing.
