The active antimicrobial effect of silver cations has been demonstrated by many studies. StopBac is a unique surgical dressing based on the sol-gel process. Silver cations are bound in a colloidal solution in an organicinorganic hybrid organosilicate oligomer. This gel is deposited on a pad using spray atomisation. The result is a polymer nanolayer matrix with prolonged and controlled release of silver ions. This pad forms part of a waterproof hypoallergenic transparent adhesive bandage. The goal of this study was to prospectively evaluate the ability of StopBac to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs) in patients after abdominal surgery. The secondary goal was to compare costs and determine the properties of this new material. A total of 32 patients were included in the study. The patients were followed up until their surgical wounds healed completely. An SSI occurred only in one patient. The aim of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the effect of StopBac (Grade Medical, CZE), a new surgical dressing, in preventing surgical wound infections. StopBac consists of a matrix of organicinorganic hybrid oligomers that ensure the controlled release of silver (Ag+) cations. The importance of silver ions in the treatment of chronic and especially infected wounds has been demonstrated in many studies. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Under laboratory conditions, silver ions demonstrate high antimicrobial activity not only against bacteria but also against viruses and fungi. 6 The antibacterial effect of the StopBac dressing, based on the controlled release of silver ions, is further enhanced locally by the high hydrophobicity of the hybrid polymer matrix layer, which creates an environment unsuitable for bacteria propagation.",

If used correctly, dressings that use silver as an antimicrobial agent are suitable for dressing wounds with bacterial infection. 7 Silver ions have been demonstrated to have an inhibitory effect against both gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial strains. 8 The antibacterial effect of silver ions is also due to their high potential for interrupting the transport and release of potassium ions (K+) from bacterial cells and blocking the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate. 9 Moreover, the ions of silver easily bind to a whole range of biomolecules such as DNA, RNA, and peptides, forming insoluble compounds and thus preventing bacterial cell division and reproduction. 10 Hybrid nanolayers prepared using the sol-gel method based on 3-trimethoxy-silyl propylmethacrylate containing ion-bound silver cations introduced in the form of a solution of silver nitrate, demonstrate high antibacterial effects, and are suitable for medical applications. 7 Our prospective observational study focused primarily on postoperative surgical wounds that were aseptic (hernia surgery) and potentially contaminated (hepatopancreatobiliary and colorectal surgery and nephrectomy). It is a well-known fact that ERCP with stent implantation prior to surgery significantly increases the risk of intra-abdominal infection and wound contamination. 11, 12 However, in our study, neither ERCP nor any other known risk factors affected the development of SSI.
