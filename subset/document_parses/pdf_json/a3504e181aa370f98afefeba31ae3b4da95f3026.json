Disrupting the EZH2-EED interaction, which is required for PRC2 enzymatic activity, is a promising strategy for cancer treatment. However, this kind of inhibitors are still limited. The in-cell protein-protein interaction screening was conducted for approximately 1300 compounds by NanoBRET technology. Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP), protein thermal shift assay (PTSA), and cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) were performed to investigate the regulation of PRC2 by AZD9291. The anti-tumor effects of AZD9291 on breast cancer (BC) cells and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) cells were detected. MicroRNA array assay, luciferase reporter assay, and qRT-PCR were conducted to identify the interaction and regulation among AZD9291, EZH2, and miR-34a. We discovered that, AZD9291, a potent and selective EGFR inhibitor, disrupted the interaction of EZH2-EED, leading to impairment of PRC2 activity and downregulation of EZH2 protein. In addition, AZD9291 declined EZH2 mRNA expression via upregulating the expression of a tumor suppressor, miR-34a. Our results suggest that AZD9291 can serve as a lead compound for further development of antagonist of PRC2 protein-protein interactions and EZH2 mRNA may be a direct target of miR-34a through non-canonical base pairing.",

Previous studies showed that PRC2 was frequently dysregulated in multiple human cancers [1] [2] [3] [4] . The enzymatic unit of PRC2 resides in the enhancer of zeste homolog 2 (EZH2) subunit's SET region, which mediates silencing of target genes via local chromatin reorganization. Furthermore, high levels of H3K27me3 have been found in both hematological malignancies and solid cancers, due to EZH2 overexpression and/or EZH2 mutation [5] [6] [7] . These evidence highlight the development of PRC2 inhibitors as a therapeutic approach for cancer treatment. Indeed, several S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM)-competitive compounds are currently in clinical trials, and have demonstrated efficacy in treating hematological malignancy.",

            "text": "In addition, PRC2 is an obligate multimeric complex, and indeed its components all engage the chromatin substrate in the course of H3K27me3 deposition by EZH2 [8] . EZH2 adopts an autoinhibited conformation when on its own, and its catalytic activity and in vivo stability both require binding to two other core PRC2 subunits, EED and SUZ12 [8] . H3K27me3 recognition by EED is essential in stimulating basal PRC2 activity and propagating H3K27 methylation in repressive chromatin for gene silencing. And the binding of H3K27me3 to EED causes a conformational change of the stimulation-responsive motif in EZH2, leading to the enhanced catalytic efficiency, which was illustrated by crystal structures of the PRC2 complex. This implicated finding PRC2 inhibitors disabled the PRC2 complexes in cancer by destroying protein interactions is an alternative strategy. A stabilized \u0251-helix of EZH2 (SAM-EZH2) peptide has been reported that it selectively inhibits H3 Lys27 tri-methylation in PRC2-dependent MLL-AF9 leukemia cells by disrupting the EZH2-EED complex [9] . Moreover, EED226 and A-395 represent small molecular antagonists of PRC2 protein-protein interactions for disruption of the PRC2 complex [10, 11] .",

We first found that AZD9291, a covalent epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, which has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of nonsmall-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR T790M [12] , disrupted the interaction between EZH2 and EED, impaired the PRC2 complex and inhibited cancer cells proliferation and mobility. Then, we explored the potential regulatory mechanisms and found that AZD9291 also regulated the expression of EZH2 via upregulating miR-34a. Additionally, miR-34a may directly target the mRNA of EZH2 through a non-canonical binding. Therefore, AZD9219 may provide a therapeutic option and indicate us to further improve the efficacy of PRC2 inhibitors.",

Here, we used EZH2 and EED proteins expressed in HEK293T cells to do protein-protein interaction (PPI) monitoring and screening studies that reflect true cellular physiology. An in-house compound bank, containing approximately 1300 known compounds, was screened using this method. Among them, AZD9291, with the concentration of 5 \u03bcM disrupted the interaction between EZH2 and EED significantly, as well as astemizole, which has been reported as a small molecular inhibitor targeting the EZH2-EED interaction [14] (Fig. 1a) . Other EGFR inhibitors, gefitinib and afatinib, and EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors EPZ-6438, GSK126, had no such effects in this assay (Fig. S1a) . Then we performed Co-IP in HEK293T cell to identify if AZD9291 disrupted the binding of EZH2 and EED. As indicated in Fig. 1b, like EED226 , AZD9291 treatment produced a clear decreased EED level when immunoprecipitation of EZH2 followed by immunoblotting with anti-EED antibody. Similar results were obtained using IP EED followed by immunoblotting with anti-EZH2 antibody (Fig. 1b) . Ligand binding to a protein is known to increase its thermal stability, which is reflected by a shift between the thermal denaturation curves of the unliganded protein and the liganded protein. A fluorescence-based thermal shift assay is used to study thermal stabilization of proteins upon ligand binding [15] . Such assays have been used extensively on purified proteins in the drug discovery industry and in academia to detect protein interactions. In the assay, we found that AZD9291 did not dose-dependently shift the melting temperature (Tm) of EED until reaching a plateau (Fig. 1c) , suggesting that AZD9291 did not directly bind to EED protein. Moreover, we found that AZD9291 might directly bind with EZH2, not EED or SUZ12, to increase its stability by CETSA, which method allows studies of target engagement of drug candidates in a cellular context [16] . On the Western blots, we found the presence of detected proteins at the lower test temperatures followed by its disappearance as the temperature AZD9291 inactivates the PRC2 complex to mediate tumor growth inhibition KL Zhang et al. increased. The encouraging thing was that only EZH2 protein appeared at higher temperature after incubation with AZD9291 (Figs. 1d and S1b). Taken together, these results strongly suggested that AZD9291 selectively bound to EZH2 and disrupted the EZH2-EED interaction.",

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines (DLBCL) U2932 and DB, and BC cell lines MDA-MB-453, T47D were exposed to AZD9291 or an enzymatic inhibitor, EPZ-6438 for 72 h. As expected, AZD9291 dose-dependently decreased the EZH2, EED, SUZ12 and H3K27me3 levels in all tested BC and DLBCL cell lines. By contrast, EPZ-6438, which competes for SAM, only inhibited H3K27 methylation, and had no effect on EZH2, EED and SUZ12 expression. In addition, the other histone H3 methylation modifications were unaffected by AZD9291 and EPZ-6438, highlighting the exquisite specificity of AZD9291 for PRC2 inhibition (Fig. 2a) . To better understand the cellular effect of AZD9291, a few genes which were reported as target of PRC2 were selected for validation by qRT-PCR. The changes of gene expression induced by AZD9291 were similar to those induced by EPZ-6438 in BC and lymphoma cell lines. (Fig. 2b and S2a) .

We also found that after a long time treatment, AZD9291 decreased the colony formation number of BC cells (Fig. 2d) . We then examined the effects of AZD9291 on cell cycle distribution and apoptotic ratio of BC cells MDA-MB-453 and T47D, and lymphoma cells U2932 and DB. Compared with control, there was an accumulation of cell population in G 0 /G 1 phase and no significant effect on apoptotic ratio was observed after treatment with AZD9291 ( Fig. 2e and S2b).

Meanwhile, when EGF factor was used to activate the EGFR pathway in advance, AZD9291 also decreased the expression of EZH2 (Fig. S2d ). All these data indicated that AZD9291 decreased the protein level of EZH2, inhibited PRC2 activity, independent of the expression of EGFR.

            "text": "Previous studies emphasized the dissociation of the EZH2-EED complex may impair the stability of EZH2 in cells. So we detected AZD9291's effect on the stability of EZH2. Cycloheximide (CHX) is always used to inhibit protein de novo synthesis. As expected, in the cells treated with CHX and AZD9291 together, the half-life of EZH2, EED and SUZ12 was much shorter compared to the treatment with AZD9291 5 \u03bcM alone (Fig. 3a) . Moreover, we found that treatment with AZD9291 increased the EZH2 ubiquitination in MDA-MB-435 cells (Fig. 3b ). All these data indicated that AZD9291 attenuated EZH2 stability. To our surprise, quantitative real-time PCR showed that AZD9291 treatment significantly decreased the mRNA of EZH2 in BC and DLBCL cell lines (Fig. 3c) . Several studies have indicated that there is a phenotypic discrepancy between the genetic abrogation and enzymatic inhibition of EZH2, and have further highlighted the dominant contributions of the non-catalytic functions in several cancer models [20] [21] [22] . Then mRNA levels of the BRIC5, ARL6IP, TACC3, CEP76, CENPK and CHEK1 genes, which are activated by EZH2 independent of PRC2 were analyzed after treatment with AZD9291. All these genes expressions in BC and DLBCL cells significantly declined as expected (Fig. 3d) . Above all, AZD9291 not only disturbed the interaction of EZH2 and EED, attenuated EZH2 stability, but also decreased the mRNA level of EZH2 and its activated genes. AZD9291 attenuates EZH2 mRNA via miR-34a MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been shown to negatively regulate gene expression by binding to complementary sequence sites in the 3\u2032-untranslated regions of the mRNAs of protein-coding genes, thereby degrading or blocking the translation of these mRNAs [23] . This prompted us to investigate whether miRNAs contribute to EZH2's dysregulation by AZD9291. We performed small RNAsequencing to examine the changes of miRNAs expression in AZD9291-treated MDA-MB-453 cells. Then 38 significantly upregulated and 50 downregulated miRNAs were identified ( Fig. 4a and Supplement Table S1 ). Among these upregulated miRNAs, miR-34a (miR-34a-5p) had attracted our interest, because of its ability to modulate myriad of oncogenic functions in different kinds of cancer [24] [25] [26] . Firstly, we determined the clinical significance and prognostic value of miR-34a expression by analyzing a cohort from the Kaplan-Meier-plotter (http://kmplot. com/analysis/). When METABRIC (n = 1262) dataset selected, miR-34a levels were stratified by the median level, lower levels of miR-34a were associated with poor overall survival for patients with BC (hazard ratio = 0.8, 95% confidence interval = 0.65, 0.98; P[logrank test] = 0.028). Kaplan-Meier plots were generated for the median cutoff (Fig. 4b) . When TCGA (n = 1077) dataset selected, identified 97 TNBC patients, lower level of miR-34a was associated with poor overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.24, 95% confidence interval = 0.07, 0.85; P[log-rank test] = 0.017) (Fig. 4c) , as same result in 996 ER-positive BC patients (hazard ratio = 0.75, 95% confidence interval = 0.59, 0.94; P[log-rank test] = 0.012) (Fig. 4d) .",

If the increased expression of miR-34a is crucial for the downregulation of EZH2, we would expect miR-34a could mimic AZD9291's effect on EZH2. Indeed, miR-34a had the same effects with AZD9291 on cell cycle (Fig. 5a) , apoptosis (Fig. 5b) , and metastasis (Fig. 5c, d) . In addition, miR-34a downregulated the mRNA expression of EZH2 activated genes and upregulated EZH2 inhibited genes (Fig. 5e, f) . Furthermore, infection with the inhibitor of miR-34a (anti-miR-34a) partially restored the protein level of EZH2 and H3K27me3 in AZD9291treated cells (Fig. 5g) . In dual-luciferase test, AZD9291 also decreased EZH2 3\u2032UTR expression like miR-34a did (Fig. 5h) .

Yet clinical benefits of EZH2 enzymatic inhibitors remain unsatisfactory and limited to certain hematological malignancies. Whereas other types of EZH2 inhibitors remain to be optimized, such EZH2-EED interaction disruptors are still in the preclinical stage [10] [NCT02900651]. In this study, we showed that the AZD9291, a potent and selective EGFR inhibitor, disturbed the interaction of EZH2-EED, leading to impairment of PRC2 activity, promoting EZH2 degradation, which was independent of EGFR expression. Further, AZD9291 upregulated the expression of miR-34a, which targeted EZH2 3\u2032UTR and decreased its mRNA and protein level (Fig. 5i) . All these data supported that AZD9291 could serve as a lead compound for further development.",

            "text": "miRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that typically repress the expression of target genes through mRNA degradation or inhibition of translation [34] . EZH2 has been considered to be regulated by miRNAs to promote disease progression. Some miRNAs (e.g., miR-126, miR-138, miR-32, miR-26a, miR-506, miR-137, and miR-101) are reported to directly target EZH2 in different types of cancer and display different functions [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . For example, miR-126 and miR-138 directly target EZH2 transcript and increase the sensitivity of osteosarcoma cells and gastric cancer cells to chemotherapy. In this study, we performed small RNAsequencing and identified that the down-regulation of EZH2 mRNA was caused by miR-34a. miR-34a and its downstream targets have been found to influence cancer stem cells proliferation, metastasis, and chemoresistance of cancers, so that small molecules having a similar function as miR-34a are often regarded as better candidates for cancer treatment [40] [41] [42] [43] . MiR-34a expression is reported to be inactivated by aberrant DNA methylation and this is implicated in tumor suppression [44] . In addition, it has been reported that EZH2 decreases the miR-34a promoter activity though physically interacted with HOTAIR and represses its expression [45] . Treatment with the EZH2 enzymatic inhibitor, GSK126, or the DNA methylation inhibitor, 5-Aza-2\u2032deoxycytidine, partially restored miR-34a levels [46] . However, in our study, we found that miR-34a was upregulated by AZD9291 in DLBCL cells and breast cancer cells. We also proved that there was a non-classical binding site in the EZH2 3\u2032UTR for miR-34a, and suggested that EZH2 mRNA may be a direct target of miR-34a with non-canonical base pairing way, which may give us some hints about miRNA complex and flexible targeting rules. We also found that low expression of miR-34a was associated with poor overall survival in BC patients, especially in TNBC patients. We demonstrated that upregulation of miR-34a inhibited tumor cells proliferation and invasion by decreasing EZH2. These indicated that miR-34a might be a useful biomarker to identify possible responders, which expand the translation avenue for EZH2 inhibitors and combination therapy in cancer treatments.",
