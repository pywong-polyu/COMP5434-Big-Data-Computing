Wuhan city, capital of Hubei province of China, faced the first outbreak of this COVID-19 during December 2019 and all nations of the world are affected by COVID-19 in a gradual manner (Raibhandari et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020a, b) . After China, most South Asian Countries like Japan, South Korea, and others are affected by the cross-border travels. The return of Chinese workers spread COVID-19 in Italy. The Government of India issued an advisory for travelers from China during early January and also started screening the travelers from China (https://www. mygov.in/covid-19/?cbps=1). In response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the Indian Prime Minister announced Janata (people's) curfew on 22 March 2020 from 7 am until 9 pm (https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politicsand-nation/after-janata-curfew-india-gets-ready-for-long-haul/articleshow/74765039.cms). Soon after, the Government of India announced a complete nationwide lockdown, from 24 March 2020 for 21 days (14 April 2020) (https://www.bbc. com/news/world-asia-india-52024239), all the domestic and international flights, trains, and vehicular transport except for non-essential purposes were stopped and banned. Such lockdown was unique in India; total lockdown was not seen in any other countries. This sudden decision impacted poor people and migrant workers in major cities, Delhi, and Mumbai.

The average concentration of PM 2.5 before lockdown was higher in comparison with the concentration after lockdown. The PM 2.5 concentration in Kolkata is reduced by 34.52%, and 27.57% in Delhi, capital of India. In general, PM 2.5 is much higher throughout the year in the northern parts of India especially in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). During pre-monsoon (March-June), winter season (December-January), and crop residue burning seasons (mid-October to mid-November), PM 2.5 varies in a range of 400-800 \u03bcgm/m 3 (Sarkar et al. , 2019 . In Mumbai, Chennai, and Hyderabad, PM 2.5 was reduced by 19.25%, 5.40%, and 3.99%, respectively. The dominance of westerly wind from arid and semi arid region and lower temperature along the Indo-Gangetic plains in the month of March, the average concentration of PM 2.5 remains higher in comparison to other cities. The proximity of Mumbai and Chennai to the sea, the air mass mostly reaches from the sea surface during March and the PM 2.5 , is lower in comparison with Delhi and Kolkata. Similar changes are also observed in the Air Quality Index (AQI) which is a function of PM 2.5 and other emissions. The improvement in air quality is clearly observed mainly due to lockdown during 22-31 March 2020. This lockdown is now extended until 17 May 2020 with little relaxation in some of the localities in cities where no case of COVID-19 was found. In India, complete lockdown was observed in a phased manner. We have considered data only for the phase 1 to avoid influence of crop harvesting, long range transport of dusts, and crop residue burning on the air quality in the month of April and later months. We have carried out an analysis of air mass trajectory for four different time periods. In Fig. 2 , we have shown air mass back trajectories at five locations of US embassies during 10-21 March and 22-31 March for the years 2019 and 2020. The back trajectories provide details about the sources of air mass reaching to five measurement locations. We have observed that Delhi is mostly influenced by western and northwestern air mass during March 2019 and March 2020. Over Mumbai, the air mass is reaching from Northern India and also from the Arabian Peninsula during 2019, whereas in March 2020, first half, air mass is coming from the Arabian sea and surrounding regions, and during 22-31 March 2020, air mass is coming from Gujarat, Rajasthan and also from the Arabian Peninsula. In Hyderabad, during 2019 and 2020, the sources of air mass are different; during 2019, air mass is coming from the southern coastal region and western parts of India. But during 2020, air mass is coming from the Bay of Bengal before lockdown, and during lockdown, the air mass is coming from the Indo-Gangetic Plains and the Bay of Bengal (Fig. 2) . Over Chennai, the air mass is reaching from the Bay of Bengal in the month of March 2019 and 2020, and during 22-31 March 2020, air mass is coming from the eastern parts of India and from the northern parts (IGP). Kolkata city is located in the eastern part of the Indo-Gangetic Plains and is mostly influenced by westerly air mass except 10-21 March 2019; in this period, air mass is coming from Hyderabad and the Odisha region. The HYSPLIT analysis clearly shows the influence of long-range transport of air mass over five different locations. The westerly air mass brings dust that affect the air quality (PM 2.5 and AQI) of Delhi, and further, the dust is transported in the eastern parts of the Indo- Gangetic Plains affecting air quality of Kolkata city. Although this does not happen always, the transport of dust at Kolkata city depends on the wind velocity; during 10-21 March 2020, the westerly air mass from IGP and long-range transport of air mass from southern India influence this city. At Hyderabad, the sources were different during 2019 and 2020. In Mumbai, mostly the air mass was northerly and westerly except 10-21 March when dominant air mass comes from the seaside. Chennai is mostly influenced by oceanic air mass. In Chennai, due to change in source of air mass, the average PM 2.5 was lower during March 2019 compared with March 2020 and also during the lockdown period (as of 22", "cite_spans": [{"start": 756, "end": 777, "text": "(Sarkar et al. , 2019", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 23, "end": 31, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 1981, "end": 1987, "text": "Fig. 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 3013, "end": 3021, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "HYSPLIT model"}, {"text": "March 2020). The long-range transport of the air pollutants influences PM 2.5 concentrations in Chennai during 2020; thus, a high value of PM 2.5 was observed during March 2020. In Fig. 3 , we have shown tropospheric NO 2 over India during March 2019 and 2020 for the periods 10-21 and 22-31 March. Over Delhi, Mumbai, and Kolkata cities, the main sources of the NO 2 emissions are anthropogenic during the month of March. Generally, in this month, biomass burning influences the southern parts of India; as a result, high NO 2 concentration over Chennai and Hyderabad are observed ; the fossil fuel consumption also adds to the pollution level. In central Indian states, Jharkhand and March 2020, the effect of lockdown is clearly observed in the average tropospheric NO 2 concentrations in most parts of India. In Figs. 3 a, b , and c, the National Capital Region (NCR, Delhi areas) is the hotspot for NO 2 concentrations (high values) in the northern parts, but during the lockdown period in the month of March 2020 (complete lockdown and closure of power plants, factories, vehicles, etc.), the NO 2 hotspot is not seen (Fig. 3d) . In the month of March 2019, major NO 2 hotspots (high values) are observed in Jharkhand, Odisha, and Eastern states. Higher values of tropospheric NO 2 concentration is attributed to the dense coal-based power plants and forest fires in Jharkhand and Odisha, and in the Eastern states (Prasad et al. 2006 ). In the Eastern states, crops' residue is burnt to prepare farms for new crops every year during March (Chauhan and Singh, 2017 . But we also observed a decline in NO 2 concentrations during the lockdown period in these parts of India. During the lockdown period starting from 22 March 2020, a sudden drop in tropospheric NO 2 concentrations over IGP is observed during 22-31 March 2020 (Fig. 4) . Such results clearly show that tropospheric NO 2 concentrations are directly related to decline in fossil fuel use and other anthropogenic activities due to complete lockdown in India.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1421, "end": 1440, "text": "(Prasad et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1546, "end": 1570, "text": "(Chauhan and Singh, 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 181, "end": 187, "text": "Fig. 3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 816, "end": 828, "text": "Figs. 3 a, b", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1124, "end": 1133, "text": "(Fig. 3d)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1838, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "HYSPLIT model"}, {"text": "Further, we have carried out a detailed analysis of NO 2 concentration and plotted the temporal variations of tropospheric NO 2 over five major cities (Fig. 5) for the month of March 2019 (blue bar) and 2020 (red bar).

In Mumbai, in both years, 2019 and 2020, a decline in NO 2 tropospheric concentration during 1 March to 9 April was observed, but due to lockdown, low tropospheric NO 2 concentration was observed in the year 2020 compared with 2019. In Hyderabad, tropospheric NO 2 concentration was also affected by lockdown; in March 2019, high values were observed compared with March 2020; a negative slope (red color line) in the month of March 2020 shows a decline in tropospheric NO 2 concentration due to lockdown.
