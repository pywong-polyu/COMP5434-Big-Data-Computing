It is claimed that women lead differently than men and are more collaboration-oriented, communicative, and less aggressive than their male counterparts. However, when talking with women in technology companies' leadership roles, a list of problems women face grows fast. We invite women in software engineering management roles to answer the questions from an empathy map canvas. We used thematic analysis for coding the answers and group the codes into themes. From the analysis, we identified seven themes that support us to list the main challenges they face in their careers.",

One main obstacle to women's retention or participation is that women's contributions and abilities are less valued than men's, and women are generally ignored in mainstream history. A systemic bias against women arose and was perpetuated for thousands of years by philosophers and thinkers. Aristotle's (384-322 BC) writings make his position clear: \"The female is as it were a deformed male. The male is by nature fitter for the command than the female... The justice of a man and a woman is not the same; the courage of a man is shown in commanding a woman obeying. In men, qualities or capacities are found in their perfection, whereas women are less balanced, more easily moved to tears, more jealous; she is also more false of speech [and] more deceptive , however, argued that women, like men, could rule and that those who showed such talents ought to be given access to education. If they are to become rulers, women must have equal access to education and training as men do. Plato advocated education for women so that they could participate equally in society (Frize, 2005) .",

Persistent social phenomena, such as the gender wage gap or the underrepresentation of women in highly competitive occupations and job positions, have been linked to such observations. One prominent hypothesis to explain this phenomenon relates to the idea that the gender of one's opposition could influence competitive behavior. More generally, people may behave differently when competing against adversaries from the opposite sex. If true, this would imply wide-ranging consequences in a number of settings. For instance, numerous work environments are characterized by persistent under-representation of one gender. Women are especially under-represented in jobs that are generally associated with high-pressure environments and large stakes, such as financial management (the share of females at Wall Street remains at approximately 10 percent) or CEO positions in the US (2.5 percent). Other areas with low female employee shares include ITand math-related occupations, where women usually occupy less than 20 percent of positions.",

            "text": "Eagly and Carli (Eagly and Carli, 2003 ) say any female advantage in leadership style might be offset by disadvantage that flows from prejudice and discrimination directed against women as leaders. Prejudice consists of an unfair evaluation of a group of people based on stereotypical judgments of the group rather than its members' behavior or qualifications. When people hold stereotypes about a group, they expect that group to possess characteristics and exhibit behavior consistent with those stereotypes. They also say, consistent with role incongruity theory, stereotype research reveals that people do consider men to be more agentic than women and women to be more communal than men. Also, the communal qualities that people associate with women, such as warmth and selflessness, diverge from the agentic qualities, such as assertiveness and instrumentality, that people perceive as characteristics of successful leaders. In contrast, the predominantly agentic qualities that people associate with men are similar to the qualities perceived to be needed for success in high-status occupations, including most managerial occupations. Novielli and Serebrenik (Novielli and Serebrenik, 2019) said that the interest in the power of emotions stimulated efforts to study the link between emotions and developers' productivity and understand the triggers for emotions during software development and related activities, and assess the impact of emotions on the developers' well-being. They say that a team manager or the scrum master can benefit from understanding the developers' emotions. Such an understanding can, for example, inform retrospective analysis that considers emotions for identifying and correcting uneven task distribution or for providing just-in-time support to a team member stuck in dealing with a programming task.",

First, the data is coded, which means that parts of the text can be given a code representing a certain theme, area, construct, etc. One code is usually assigned to many pieces of text, and one piece of text can be assigned more than one code. Codes can form a hierarchy of codes and sub-codes. The coded material can be combined with the researcher's comments and reflections (i.e., \"memos\"). When this has been done, the researcher can go through the material to identify a first set of hypotheses. For example, these can be phrases similar in different parts of the material, patterns in the data, differences between sub-groups of subjects, etc. The identified hypotheses can then be used when further data collection is conducted in the field, i.e., resulting in an iterative approach where data collection and analysis is conducted in parallel as described above. During the iterative process, a small set of generalizations can be formulated, eventually resulting in a formalized body of knowledge, which is the final result of the research attempt. This is, of course, not a simple sequence of steps. Instead, they are executed iteratively, and they affect each other. We performed a thematic analysis with open coding on the responses from the empathy map. We read and reread the data, looking for keywords, trends, themes, or ideas to outline the analysis. This analysis identified themes across the questions from the survey. Table 2 lists the codes, themes, and quotes.",

Permission to Occupy Authorized Spaces As mentioned at the beginning of this work, Frize (Frize, 2005) says there are serious gender issues that can severely limit women's participation in science and engineering careers, and these are similar in many parts of the world. One main obstacle to women's retention or participation is that women's contributions and abilities are less valued than men's, and women are generally ignored in mainstream history. From the answers we collected, it is possible to see that women want to occupy positions that men traditionally occupied. However, there is also a sensation that women can occupy those roles when \"authorized.\" The positions occupied for those women are as they were given the right to be there, and it is what they deserve.",

We also cannot generalize the results, and no intersectionality evaluation could be done once the three women reported being white women. Intersectionality is the theoretical framework for understanding how aspects of a person's social and political identities (e.g., gender, sex, race, class, sexuality, religion, ability, physical appearance, height, etc.) might combine to create unique modes of discrimination and privilege, coined by Kimberle Crenshaw (Crenshaw, 1989) . However, we intended to bring some initial insights from applying the empathy map technique to these women and raise awareness of what impacts their careers, the challenges they face, and show the distress they are exposed to. This work is the initial step of a broader work where using empirical strategies; we aimed to understand if a software development team with greater gender diversity performs better than a homogeneous team and which factors may be the most impacted by this spectrum of diversity. Data collection is happening in different companies from the information technology industry through surveys, interviews, and code repository analysis from other software development teams' roles. With that, we expect to reach a broader number of women of different races/ethnicities, cultures, etc. So we will be able to analyze the data from the point of view of intersectionality.",
