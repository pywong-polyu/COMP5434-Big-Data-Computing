On 30 January, 2020, the outbreak was declared a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization (WHO) [2] . Two weeks later, the first case of COVID-19 was reported on the African continent in Egypt [3] . In response to the looming public health crisis, African governments introduced regulations and restrictions such as travel bans, border closures, curfews, lockdowns, and social distancing [4] . While these mitigation measures were aimed at slowing down the spread of COVID-19 and preventing healthcare systems from becoming overwhelmed, there have been wide-reaching unintended consequences on health systems. The demand for essential health services has been adversely affected by stay-at-home orders, stigma and fear of contracting COVID-19 infection, travel restrictions, increased financial barriers and misinformation about COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] . The provision of routine health services has been disrupted by the diversion of limited resources and health care workers for COVID-19 prevention and control efforts, the occupational risk faced by health care workers, the lack of personal protective equipment, and breakdowns in procurement and supply chains for medicines and commodities [7, 8] . Similar reductions in the demand and provision of essential health services were observed during the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa [9] .",

Several modelling analyses have assessed the potential impact of disruptions in health service provision on malaria morbidity and mortality. Findings from these analyses have asserted that lack of continuity and disruption of malaria programmes could cause a COVID-19-induced malaria crisis, potentially reversing the gains towards malaria control and elimination [11] [12] [13] [14] . More devastating effects of the pandemic are expected in Africa because of the disproportionate burden of infectious diseases, including malaria, weaker health systems and limited financial and human resources for health [11, 12] . One modelling analysis projected that if the distribution of ITNs was suspended and access to anti-malarial medicines reduced by 75%, an additional 769,000 malaria deaths would occur in sub-Saharan Africa in 2020 [14] . Another modelling analysis estimated that in malaria-endemic areas, the disruption of planned ITN distribution campaigns, because of the COVID-19 pandemic, could cause a 36% increase in malaria deaths in the next five years [12] . COVID-related reductions or suspensions of ITN and IRS campaigns, which are the cornerstone of malaria vector control in Africa, were projected to give rise to the largest number of additional malaria deaths [11] [12] [13] [14] . These estimates most likely underestimate the potential excess mortality as the underlying models do not account for disruptions in the delivery of other life-saving malaria interventions, such as seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) and intermittent preventative treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) [15] . However, these initial estimates inform pandemic response by forecasting morbidity and mortality, estimating healthcare system requirements and assessing the effectiveness of various containment and mitigation strategies.",

In response to COVID-19, the Government of Zimbabwe introduced public health measures to curb the spread of disease on 30 March, 2020 [6, 21, 22] . These measures included closure of borders, restrictions on in-country travel, bans on public gatherings, the closure of schools, colleges and universities, and the designation of quarantine and isolation facilities for suspected and confirmed COVID-19 cases [22, 23] . There was a peak in the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths in September and October 2020 ( Fig. 1 ). Since December 2020, the country has been experiencing a second wave of COVID-19 with a higher transmission rate [24] .

Passive malaria surveillance data are routinely collected from all public and private health facilities and submitted to the HMIS regularly. The malaria data are relatively complete [28] . For this analysis, confirmed malaria cases and deaths data aggregated by month and district were used. Given weekly fluctuations in malaria cases and deaths, monthly data was used for this analysis. This analysis used data up to 30 June, 2020 to ensure the inclusion of the peak malaria transmission season for 2020. Malaria cases and deaths were aggregated by province and year (2017, 2018, 2019, 2020), and stratified by age (< 5 years and \u2265 5 years) and gender (male and female). Using district population counts from the 2012 Census adjusted for annual population growth rate (1.1%) [26] , malaria incidence per 1000 population and malaria mortality per 100,000 population were calculated. Changes in malaria cases and deaths during the pandemic were evaluated by comparing the observed values for January-June 2020 to expected values based on previous years. The expected values were calculated by taking the mean of values for the same months in 2017, 2018 and 2019. Maps of malaria incidence and mortality by year were used to describe the spatial variation at the district level. Data management and analysis were conducted using STATA 15 (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA) and maps were generated using ArcMap 10.5.1 (ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA).",

The increase in malaria morbidity and mortality coincided with both the peak malaria season and the detection of the first cases of COVID-19 and implementation of nationwide containment and mitigation measures to curtail spread of COVID-19. It is likely that several factors explain the observed increase in malaria transmission and outbreaks, including COVID-19-related disruptions in the malaria prevention and control activities, limited availability of malaria commodities, modification of health-seeking behaviour, and possible changes in case management and reporting practices. According to WHO, less than half of the 22 million ITNs, that were expected to be distributed globally in 2020, had been distributed as of November 2020 [32] . Additionally, less than half of malaria-endemic countries that had planned IRS campaigns in 2020 had completed them [32] . Although it is likely the increased morbidity and mortality is the result of COVID-19-related disruptions in malaria prevention and control activities, for Zimbabwe it is unlikely to result from disruptions in IRS. IRS is typically deployed prior to the commencement of the rainy season in November/December. The NMCP began deploying for the 2019/2020 season in November 2019. A total of 2,151,375 rooms (88% of those targeted) were sprayed and a population of 3,164,344 (83% of targeted population) were covered [33] .",

On one hand, lockdowns, curfews, in-country travel restrictions, and fear of infection may have disincentivized accessing routine health services resulting in the reduced uptake of essential health services and increased malaria transmission. In several malaria-endemic countries, including Zimbabwe, there was a decrease in malaria outpatient attendance in 2020 following the implementation of nationwide lockdowns [32] . On the other hand, the excess in malaria morbidity and mortality observed may be a result of efforts by the Ministry of Health and Child Care to maintain essential health services amid the pandemic. Individuals suspected of having malaria are routinely tested for malaria using rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Increased awareness and vigilance by health care workers may have improved and widened testing practices to diagnose malaria and reporting practices. Also, public health messaging encouraging early care-seeking for any COVID-19 symptoms, including fever, may have promoted prompt care-seeking. Given the overlapping symptoms between COVID-19 and malaria, individuals with fever, headache and body aches or weakness who under normal circumstances would not have sought care may have promptly sought care.",

For example, the higher occurrence of malaria might be associated with variations in environmental factors such as temperature and rainfall. Previous research has showed the important role of environmental factors play in malaria transmission in Zimbabwe [34, 35] . To understand the drivers of the observed trends in malaria morbidity and mortality, further contextual information on the far-reaching impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures is needed. Furthermore, given the impact of the pandemic is likely to be lagged in time, further studies should consider time periods beyond the initial few months of the pandemic.",

Second, the analysis made use of routine malaria surveillance data, which are prone to data quality issues and low reporting rates. Although a data quality audit of the malaria data obtained from the national HMIS was not conducted in the present study, previous research suggests high data quality, timely reporting and high completeness [28] . Several research studies have used routine malaria surveillance data from Zimbabwe to assess changes in malaria indicators, such as intervention coverage and incidence rates [29, 30, 34] . Third, the observed trends in malaria incidence and mortality reported here likely do not represent trends in the 2020/2021 season. Lastly, this analysis only presented trends for two indicators: malaria incidence and malaria mortality. There is an opportunity to supplement data from the HMIS with data from household surveys assessing changes in health-seeking behaviour and intervention coverage and data from health facility surveys assessing availability and readiness of health facilities to provide essential malaria services [25] .",
