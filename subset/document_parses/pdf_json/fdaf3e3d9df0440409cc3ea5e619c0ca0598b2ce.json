In Poland, the first case of coronavirus disease of 2019 (COVID-19) was recorded on 4 March 2020, and on 27 December 2020, the first vaccination was performed to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. However, before vaccination, there was a constant struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic, which has become a global threat to public health. This forced the health system to radically change the way health care is organized, including ophthalmology departments [1] . Ophthalmologists have been recognized to be at high risk of COVID-19 infection, due to close contact with patients. Consequently, scheduled ophthalmology advice and surgery during the pandemic have been significantly reduced, and only emergency ophthalmology care has been allowed.",

On the other hand, given their medical knowledge, they are more aware of not only the health risks of COVID-19, but also the possible adverse effects of the vaccine itself. Like other individuals, they are also tired of the constant epidemiological restrictions and limitations of social life.

Married/cohabiting respondents with children were more likely to indicate that the vaccine was effective, compared to those without children or not in a relationship (76.1%, 37%, and 47.2%, respectively; p = 0.001), and feared contamination (65.2%, 33.3%, and 45.3%, respectively; p = 0.023); these factors indicated arguments in favor of accepting vaccination.

Of the respondents, we discovered that 92.1% trust specialists in infectious diseases, virology, and epidemiology in terms of COVID-19 and vaccinations. Moreover, 63.5% of residents learned from the internet, and 13.5% from television and radio broadcasts; however, the obtained information from these sources was not from the abovementioned specialists. Furthermore, 50% of respondents declared that they read professional press regarding COVID-19 vaccination, and 4% declared that they read non-professional press relating to the aforementioned matter. For 19.8% of residents, friends and family were their sources of information about the pandemic. None of the respondents mentioned press conferences organized by the government or individual ministries as sources of information about the COVID-19 pandemic. There were no statistically significant correlations between the type of COVID-19 knowledge sources and gender, marital status, residence place, previous COVID-19 infection, having been in quarantine, or working with COVID-19 patients. A statistically significant relationship between COVID-19 acceptance and the use of individual sources of information on the pandemic has not been confirmed (Tables S1-S3 in Supplement). Multivariate logistic regression for willingness to take the COVID-19 vaccine is shown in Table 2 . ",

Vaccine acceptance studies in a group of healthcare professionals in the United States showed that 36% of HCWs were willing to get vaccinated as soon as possible, while 56% were not convinced to get vaccinated and wanted to wait to learn more about vaccination [5] . In contrast, in a study conducted in the Democratic Republic of Congo, only 27.7% of respondents expressed a willingness to get vaccinated for COVID-19 [9] .

The main concern in both groups was the development of long-term adverse effects after receiving the COVID-19 vaccine [11] .

Additional promptness was significantly strengthened by a positive medical history of recommended vaccinations, a fear of catching COVID-19, as well as a fear of passing on the disease to friends/relatives.

However, one of the main reasons reported by such residents to receive the vaccine was that they would be able to benefit from the reduced epidemiological regime allowed for vaccinated individuals. The people that had contracted COVID-19 acquired, at least temporarily, natural immunity. In most cases, relatives were also simultaneously infected. Therefore, the fear of infection and transmitting the disease to the family is not the most important motivation for vaccination in such individuals. However, it should be emphasized that most of these people, despite having a certain immunity offered by their previous COVID-19 infection, want to get vaccinated as soon as possible. This may be due to their poor experience with SARS-CoV-2 and their uncertainty about the length of the immunization period. Our research has shown that people living alone and without children are less likely to want to be vaccinated. Such individuals may be less afraid of the pandemic, as most of these individuals are young, and are therefore less likely to develop symptoms.",

Moreover, there was a feeling of uncertainty regarding the vaccine's safety. Evidence shows that the newer the vaccine, the greater the level of hesitation and non-acceptance of it [12] . A reason that vaccines typically pose little to no threat is the slow and methodical process of developing them, which can take up to several years. The accelerated approval of the new COVID-19 vaccines may raise doubts as to whether the vaccine has been adequately tested for safety and efficacy. It should also be noted that vaccination acceptance is greatly influenced not only by vaccine type, but also by the quality and availability of the healthcare system, as well as geographical, cultural, social, political, and emotional factors [13] . Another reason for hesitation may be the misinformation spread by anti-vaccine activists, who campaign against vaccines by spreading false information.",

Negative attitudes toward vaccination among HCWs in the United States were also related to distrust in the government [5] . Our research shows that the vast majority of ophthalmology residents derive their knowledge regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and vaccination from infectious disease specialists, virologists, and immunologists, who speak unequivocally in favor of vaccination. Accordingly, the percentage of residents who are unsure about taking the vaccine, and that of residents who refuse vaccination (17.5% and 11.1%, respectively), is apparently high. It was found that, for many young healthcare professionals, theoretical considerations about vaccine safety-supported by clinical trials, but with a limited study group and a short follow-up period-do not provide a sufficient incentive for vaccination.",

Such fears may negatively influence the physician's critical thinking and decision-making. On the other hand, the introduction of a program of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 worldwide provides a certain perspective for the restoration of normality in many areas of life, perhaps most significantly in helping to relieve the psychological stress affecting both patients and HCWs [14] .

Most of the respondents in our study learned about the pandemic from specialists in the field of viral diseases, with a complete lack of trust in politicians in this regard. Therefore, medical authorities should focus more on giving further knowledge regarding the COVID-19 pandemic, and demand and persuade citizens to take the COVID-19 vaccine.
