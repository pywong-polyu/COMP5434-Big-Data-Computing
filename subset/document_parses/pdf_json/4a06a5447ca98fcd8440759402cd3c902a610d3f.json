            "text": "In Segen's Medical Dictionary, silent infection is defined as an infection lacking significant clinical signs of disease. Silent infections may be recognized only in retrospect, e.g., by a 4-fold increase in antibody titres to a particular pathogen, especially viruses. McGraw-Hill Concise Dictionary gives a similar definition. In our article, silent infection includes both confirmed asymptomatic patients and not confirmed with viral shedding. Our epidemiological investigation shows that COVID-19 silent infection transmission may result in not only mild clinical illness but also severe clinical illness. It implies that COVID-19 infection power is quite strong. ere is also a Germany report about asymptomatic carriers, but the final result is unspecific symptom patient [11, 12] . Our epidemiological investigation lasted for 2 months and the index showed no symptom. e silent infection transmission spreads widely and rapidly. It quickly occupied Wuhan and then occupied other 13 cities in Hubei province, in China. Now, it has occupied almost all the countries in the world. e proportion and age-specific distribution of silent infection are very important epidemic characteristics of COVID-19. Our hypothetical models and comparison with HAV indicate that silent infection plays major infection of COVID-19 and focuses on young adults. Meanwhile, the data before January 23, 2020, in Wuhan, China, were also analyzed by a networked dynamic metapopulation model and Bayesian inference [13, 14] . In the analysis, undocumented cases accounted for 86% of the total infection cases. e result is consistent with those based on our hypothetical model. e effective prevention and control for apparent infection is early detection and early isolation. In contrast, the prevention and control for silent infection is overall isolation and overall disinfection. ese prevention and control measures are significantly different. e prevention and control measures of COVID-19 belong to the later. Overall isolation and overall disinfection should be implemented as soon as possible. ese measures are the key for the prevention and control of COVID-19. e successful prevention and control of COVID-19 in other provinces (except Wuhan and Hubei provinces) in China also confirmed that these \"hardcore\" measures are indeed very effective. Most of the provinces in China controlled the COVID-19 epidemic within 2-4 weeks. However, the similar measures of overall isolation in Wuhan and Hubei province continued 2-3 months until the epidemic exponential growth curve passed the turning point. e prevention and control measures in Korea followed overall disinfection but not strictly overall isolation; therefore, it presented a persistent low-level epidemic. However, Italy, Spain, and New York had no isolation and no disinfection at the early stage; therefore, severe outbreak presented in these countries.",

For example, Wuhan tested all citizens after isolation from May 16 to 30, which found about 300 asymptomatic patients in 10 million residents. If the prevention was relaxed, the epidemic would rebound in the city. However, if all residents still wear masks always and wash hands often, and the monitoring work is still running well, there will only be sporadic outbreak, but no epidemic. For sporadic outbreak, we may only take simple measures such as local isolation.",
