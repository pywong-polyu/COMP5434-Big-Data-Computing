The contacted experts were academics working on dementia and psychosocial innovations, industry professionals from eHealth software companies, clinicians, patient organizations, and people with dementia and their caregivers. In step 2, contact persons from the suggested eHealth interventions participated in a semistructured telephone interview. The results were analyzed using a multiple case study methodology.",

The origin of the case studies was also important, as eHealth interventions that had originated in an academic research context less reliably found their way to sustainable implementation. In addition, careful selection of digital transformation strategies, more intersectoral cooperation, and more funding for implementation and business modeling research are recommended to help future developers bring eHealth interventions for caregivers of people with dementia into practice.",

            "text": "Background A recent systematic review [1] showed that very few evidence-based eHealth interventions for informal caregivers of people with dementia have been implemented in practice. eHealth, defined by the World Health Organization as \"the use of information and communication technologies (ICT) for health\" [2] , has the potential to help many people living with physical and mental health issues, including informal caregivers of people with dementia. Informal care constitutes a significant part of dementia care [3, 4] and can include helping with household chores, running errands, facilitating social engagement, and coordinating professional care. In the Netherlands, it has been estimated that approximately 10% of the 16 million inhabitants offer some form of informal care [5] , whereas an estimated 320,000 informal caregivers provide care specifically for people with dementia [6] . However, informal caregivers have also been shown to experience physical and psychological complaints as a result of this caregiving process [7] . Given the fact that the current worldwide prevalence of dementia (50 million people) is expected to triple by 2050 [8] and the health care systems' increasing reliance on informal care [9] , it is important to support these informal caregivers of people with dementia. Previous research has shown that eHealth interventions to support these caregivers have been effective in improving caregiver outcomes, such as self-efficacy, competence, and knowledge about dementia, and in reducing depressive symptoms [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .",

There is preliminary evidence that web-based tools might be at least as effective as face-to-face interventions in delivering psychiatric support [21] , although more research is needed. eHealth as a potential solution to facilitate access to dementia caregiving support is even more crucial in the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic. A recent article in The Lancet on the impact of COVID-19 on people with dementia and their caregivers advised care professionals to organize psychoeducation, self-management, and consultations for dementia caregivers on the web [22] . A survey of 1000 Dutch caregivers of people with dementia by Alzheimer Netherlands showed that the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in the cancelation of day care services for people with dementia as well as insufficient professional and social support. Caregivers mentioned digital contacts, such as video chatting or WhatsApp messaging, as one of the solutions that currently helps them the most [23] .",

They did this in terms of both content and volume. Other case studies (such as Thinkability) offered their eHealth interventions on the web for a fixed price, after which the buyer had access to the service indefinitely. Indeed, in this sample, Thinkability is the only intervention whose cost structure was centered around direct download from the internet by the caregiver, without mediation by an existing health care system. STAR eLearning and the case study 6 modules are also available for the caregiver to access without a health care organization, although these modules are at least partly integrated into existing dementia care systems, such as dementia meeting centers and a care organization, respectively. Finally, some cases, such as Carenzorgt and DementieNL (and Myinlife), made no revenue but instead increased the attractiveness of a larger health care platform or organization:",

Previous research has discussed the frequent outsourcing of services in ICT [41] and emphasized the importance of trust between involved parties in constructing these types of business models in eHealth [42] .

A prevalent, sustainable cost structure is a fixed price for access to the intervention's information or services, which is paid by health care organizations. Another viable option for sustainability is integration into a larger platform that sponsors the eHealth intervention, so no cost is charged from the caregiver. Again, it is clear that when considering the viability of these business models, viewing the intervention within its health care context can facilitate its sustainable implementation [28] . This pertains to both the desirability of the intervention through its contextual fit and its financial viability through its use of revenue structures already in place. A good example of the successful application of these 3 core model elements is OZOverbindzorg, which makes use of fixed price, low cost, and equal buy-ins from collaborations between health insurers and municipalities per participating region. This is in line with the principles discussed in previous research, namely, that costs and benefits should be balanced between parties in eHealth, and one party should not disproportionally benefit from something that is financed by the other party [43] . Here, the benefits are shared between the care organizations and community well-being; therefore, it is fair that both equally contribute to the costs.",

Indeed, most academic interventions are constrained by expiring funding [44] , and integration within existing structures is crucial.

First, there is a possibility of selection bias, as the definition of this sample required responses from the authors' own dementia and eHealth networks. As a result, the first possible bias is toward experts from academia, who are overrepresented in this sample. Second, there is likely a higher than average degree of sample familiarity with the authors' own interventions, Partner in Balance and Myinlife, as the contacted experts belong to the same networks (such as INTERDEM) and are often exposed to other members' research. Moreover, the authors acknowledge the potential bias in reporting the results concerning Myinlife and Partner in Balance, as they were involved in their development and evaluation. Third, it is likely that more interventions originating from the Southern Netherlands were included (as this is where the authors' research group is based), whereas interventions from elsewhere in the Netherlands remained underrepresented. A second limitation concerns the potential self-report bias of the included case study respondents to emphasize positive aspects of their own interventions and minimize difficulties in the responses about their learned lessons. A final limitation concerns the fact that this study did not guarantee respondents' total anonymity; because interventions would be referred to by name (unless respondents explicitly requested otherwise, as in case studies 5 and 8), the intervention could conceivably be linked to one of a few possible intervention respondents. This was discussed before the interview and agreed to by the respondents, who also provided a member check, approving the interview transcript. This lack of total anonymity could have impeded respondents from discussing more sensitive implementation topics candidly, out of fear of (social) repercussions from collaborators. Another possible consequence of this lack of anonymity is that the eHealth contact persons might not have wanted to share important details of their business plans to remain competitive.",

            "text": "Case studies that did not originate from an academic research context seemed to achieve more sustainability, whereas case studies from academic research contexts experienced barriers to financial independence from research grants. Examining the common and differential characteristics of these case studies resulted in the proposal of a core business model for eHealth interventions for caregivers of people with dementia, derived from a sample of case studies currently being used in practice. This proposed core business model suggests increasing desirability, feasibility, and viability by integrating into larger structures; owning and supporting content internally while developing ICT services externally; and offering fixed, low-level pricing. Together with the origin of the case studies, these elements contributed to the sustainability of case studies. Finally, targeted digital transformation strategies, more intersectoral cooperation, and more financial incentives for research on sustainable business models are recommended to help future developers bring eHealth interventions for caregivers of people with dementia into practice.",
