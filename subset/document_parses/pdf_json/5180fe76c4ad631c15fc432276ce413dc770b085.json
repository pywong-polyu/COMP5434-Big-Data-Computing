Endo-\u03b1-1,2-mannosidase (MANEA) is the sole endoacting glycoside hydrolase involved in N-glycan trimming and is located within the Golgi, where it allows ER-escaped glycoproteins to bypass the classical N-glycosylation trimming pathway involving ER glucosidases I and II.

We reveal structural features of the human enzyme that explain its substrate preference and the mechanistic basis for catalysis. These structures have inspired the development of new inhibitors that disrupt host protein N-glycan processing of viral glycans and reduce the infectivity of bovine viral diarrhea and dengue viruses in cellular models.

These results may contribute to efforts aimed at developing broad-spectrum antiviral agents and help provide a more in-depth understanding of the biology of mammalian glycosylation. glycosylation | structural biology | secretory pathway | enzyme | antiviral A sparagine (N)-linked glycosylation is a protein modification that is widespread in eukaryotes and is essential for protein quality control and trafficking (1) . N-linked glycans contribute to protein structure and stability, receptor targeting, development, and immune responses (2) . N-linked glycosylation occurs in the secretory pathway and is initiated in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through cotranslational transfer of the triantennary Glc 3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 glycan from a lipid linked precursor (2) (3) (4) (5) (Fig. 1) . The formation of mature glycoproteins requires the removal of the glucose residues, typically through the action of \u03b1-glucosidases I and II, which are localized within the rough ER. However, in most cell lines and in human patients, genetic disruption of \u03b1-glucosidase I or II or inhibition of their activities does not prevent the formation of mature glycoproteins because of the action of Golgi endo-\u03b1-1,2-mannosidase (MANEA; mannosidase, endo-alpha) (6) , which provides a glucosidaseindependent pathway for glycoprotein maturation termed the endomannosidase pathway (7) .",

The action of MANEA on Glc 1-3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 results in cleavage of the glucosylated mannose in the A branch, releasing Glc 1-3 Man and Man 8 GlcNAc 2 ; human MANEA acts faster on Glc 1 Man than on Glc 2,3 Man glycans (9) . The endomannosidase pathway allows processing of ER-escaped, glucosylated high-mannose glycans on glycoproteins that fold independently of the calnexin/calreticulin folding cycle, allowing them to rejoin the downstream N-glycan maturation pathway. In murine BW6147 cells under normal conditions, flux through the endomannosidase pathway accounts for approximately 15% of total flux through the secretory pathway (10) ; under conditions of glucosidase blockade through knockout or inhibition, MANEA can support as much as 50% of the normal glycoprotein flux, depending on cellular expression levels (10) . MANEA activity accounts for the accumulation of Glc 3 Man tetrasaccharide in the urine of a neonate suffering from CDG-IIb, a rare genetic disease caused by a deficiency of ER glucosidase I (11) .",

Glycosidases in the secretory pathway that trim N-linked glycans play key roles in protein quality control and in the specific modifications leading to mature glycoproteins. Inhibition of glucosidases in the secretory pathway is a proven therapeutic strategy, that holds great promise in the treatment of viral disease. The enzyme endo-\u03b1-1,2-mannosidase (MANEA) provides an alternative processing pathway to evade glucosidase inhibitors. We report the three-dimensional structure of human MANEA and complexes with enzyme inhibitors that we show act as antivirals for bovine viral diarrhea and human dengue viruses. The structure of MANEA will support inhibitor optimization and the development of more potent antivirals. glycoproteins within their envelope (12) . Glycosylation is achieved by coopting host cell glycosylation machinery during replication. Substantial efforts have been deployed in the use of inhibitors of \u03b1-glucosidases I and II as antivirals (e.g., N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, 6-O-butanoylcastanospermine) for the treatment of HIV/AIDS (13) , dengue (14, 15) , and HBV (16, 17) (reviewed in refs. [18] [19] [20] . Inhibition of host glycosylation pathways, in particular ER glucosidases I and II and Golgi mannosidase I, interferes with the viral lifecycle by impairing protein folding and quality control, inducing the unfolded protein response or mistrafficking of viral glycoproteins. These changes can lead to impairment of secretion (17, (21) (22) (23) or fusion (24) (25) (26) or evasion of host immunity (27) . In the case of HBV, when glucosidases are inhibited, mature HBV viral glycoproteins are still produced through the alternative processing provided by the endomannosidase pathway (23) . However, the contribution of the endomannosidase pathway to viral protein assembly under normal conditions remains poorly studied, and the antiviral activity of inhibitors targeting MANEA has not yet been evaluated.",

            "text": "Development of MANEA Inhibitors. GlcDMJ, a cell-permeable inhibitor of MANEA (35, 36) , is composed of the well-known mannosidase iminosugar inhibitor deoxymannojirimycin (DMJ) modified with a glucosyl residue at the 3-position to enhance specificity and binding to MANEA by mimicking the substrate and benefitting from substrate-enzyme contacts in the \u22122 subsite (Fig. 2) . The related compound GlcIFG (31) , which is also cellpermeable (37) , was developed through a similar approach applied to the azasugar isofagomine (IFG). Similarly, ManIFG was synthesized to match the substrate stereochemistry of yeast mannan and is a superior inhibitor of bacterial endo-\u03b1-1,2-mannanases (30) . Because glucosylated mannans are substrates for \u03b1-glucosidase II, GlcDMJ and GlcIFG may potentially be degraded in cell-based systems (38) , leading to loss of inhibition. Examination of the threedimensional (3D) X-ray structure of \u03b1-glucosidase II in complex with N-butyldeoxynojirimycin reveals that binding of the sugarshaped heterocycle involves a pocket-like active site that will not readily accommodate additional substituents (39) . Conversely, it is known that MANEA can cleave Glc 1-3 Man substrates in which a substituent is tolerated at the 3-position of the glucosylated mannose. Therefore, we synthesized CyMe-GlcIFG, which bears a bulky cyclohexylmethyl substituent at the same position, in the expectation that it should be impervious to \u03b1-glucosidase II activity yet still bind to MANEA.",

While we were encouraged by preliminary studies on a bacterial MANEA homolog showing that CyMeGlc-IFG bound better than GlcIFG alone (K d , 284 nM vs. 625 nM), on the human enzyme, CyMe-GlcIFG bound less tightly than GlcIFG, with a K d of 929 \u00b1 52 nM (SI Appendix, Fig. S1E ), consistent with structural features observed subsequently (see below).

In the GlcIFG complex of MANEA, the -2 loop is closed over the active site, and in this conformation, triglucosylated N-glycans are unable to bind to human MANEA. However, the other observed conformations show flexibility in the loop that could allow these extended structures to bind. Of note, bovine MANEA does not process triglucosylated N-glycans (9) . While both bovine and human MANEA have the -2 loop, a Ser227 (human)-to-Lys change in the bovine enzyme was proposed to have contributed to the difference in specificity. Ser227 lies adjacent to and points toward the -2 loop, while the side chain of Lys226 (numbering as in bovine) may interact with the loop and reduce its mobility (Fig. 3F) . Interactions with the loop may explain why CyMe-GlcIFG binds nearly 50-fold more weakly than GlcIFG. Notably, bacterial GH99 endomannanases, which act on complex extended yeast mannan substrates have open active sites and do not contain this loop (SI Appendix, Fig.  S3 ). To test this hypothesis, we determined the structure of BxGH99 with CyMe-GlcIFG (K d of 339 nM; tighter binding than that of GlcIFG alone, 625 nM). The cyclohexyl ring is visible (but mobile) in the density, and indeed the loop in MANEA will occlude binding of the cyclohexyl group (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 4A .

These data showed that the combination of GlcIFG and NAP-DNJ gave a greater reduction than either agent alone, suggesting an additive antiviral effect from inhibiting both the \u03b1-glucosidase I/II and endomannosidase pathways. The addition of NAP-DNJ not only inhibits calnexin-mediated folding and quality control, but also requires viral glycans to undergo processing by MANEA, hence potentiating the antiviral effect.",

The MANEA inhibitors GlcIFG, GlcDMJ, CyMe-GlcIFG, and ManIFG were used to study levels of viral particle formation and infectivity. Viral particle formation, as assessed by secreted viral RNA, was unaffected by treatment with MANEA inhibitors (Fig. 4D) . However, treatment with GlcIFG, CyMe-GlcIFG, and GlcDMJ caused a reduction in plaque number, demonstrating that differences in glycosylation resulting from MANEA inhibition impair DENV infectivity. The greatest effect was seen for GlcDMJ, which reduced the number of plaque forming units by sixfold; ManIFG had no effect. The antiviral effect observed was at a relatively high concentration, but iminosugars are known to have difficulty in gaining access to the secretory pathway (21) .",

The data provide a structural rationale for understanding the change in specificity of this enzyme for monoglucosylated, diglucosylated, and triglucosylated high-mannose N-glycans. We also show the potential for MANEA inhibitors to alter N-glycan structures of viral envelope glycoproteins and reduce viral infectivity. MANEA processes the Glc 1-3 Man 9 GlcNAc 2 structure and provides a pathway for glycoprotein maturation independent of the classical \u03b1-glucosidase I/II-dependent pathways. Treatment of HBV with miglustat (N-butyldeoxynojirimycin, an inhibitor of \u03b1-glucosidase II) impaired viral DNA secretion and led to aberrant N-glycans on M glycoprotein, but other viral glycoproteins displayed mature glycans that arose through the endomannosidase pathway (23) .

In brief, recombinant MANEA-\u039497 featuring an N-terminal His tag was expressed in E. coli from a pColdI system coexpressing the groEL and groES genes encoding the GroEL/ES chaperone system. Recombinant MANEA-\u039497 was purified by metal-ion affinity and cation-exchange chromatography. Extensive crystal screening identified five different crystal forms, with a condition including 1 mM TEW allowing ligand-binding studies without an occluded active site. Structure solution by molecular replacement and refinement featured programs from the CCP4 suite (42) . Structures and observed data have been deposited to the Protein Data Bank. MANEA activity was determined by mass spectrometry using GlcMan 9 GlcNAc 2 as the substrate, with subsequent permethylation and analysis by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectroscopy. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was performed using a coupled assay with GlcMan 3 OMe as the substrate (30) . Ligand-binding thermodynamics were determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. Viral Infectivity Studies. Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDBK) cells were infected with BVDV at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1, followed by incubation with different concentrations of GlcIFG (0 to 1 mM) and in combination with NAP-DNJ for 24 h. Cell culture medium was harvested, and serial dilutions were made and used to infect naive MDBK cells. Cells were incubated for 24 h, then washed and fixed with 4% (vol/vol) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 30 min. Following washing and blocking, cells were permeabilized and incubated with MAb103/105 (1:500 dilution in 5% milk-PBS; Animal Health Veterinary Laboratories Agency) for 1 h. Incubation with antimouse fluorescein isothiocyanate-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500 dilution in 5% milk-PBS; Sigma-Aldrich) and staining with DAPI allowed for the counting of fluorescent foci and calculation of virus titers (in FFU/mL). The samples obtained after treatment for 24 h were treated with Endo H and separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) under nonreducing conditions. The membrane produced following transfer was probed with MAb214 primary antibody and then visualized with anti-mouse horseradish peroxidase secondary antibody (1:1,000; Dako) for 1 h.",

Previously, changes in the N-glycan structure of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein induced by the MANEA inhibitor GlcDMJ were identified by demonstrating a change in susceptibility to hydrolysis by endo-\u03b2-N-acetylglucosaminidase (endo H) (41). Therefore, we digested BVDV envelope glycoproteins E1/E2 with endo H. Increased sensitivity of E1/E2 proteins to endo H cleavage was observed in both GlcIFG and the glucosidase I/II inhibitor N-(6'-[4\u2033-azido-2\u2033-nitrophenylamino]hexyl)-1-deoxynojirimycin (NAP-DNJ), indicating an increased prevalence of high-mannose N-glycans. The increased sensitivity for GlcIFG was greater than that for NAP-DNJ, most likely reflecting the higher concentration of the former. Treatment with a combination of GlcIFG and NAP-DNJ provided an even greater sensitivity to endo H treatment, consistent with more effective cessation of N-glycan processing by blocking the glucosidase and endomannosidase pathways. We next examined BVDV replication in the presence of a combination of GlcIFG and NAP-DNJ (Fig. 4C). These data showed that the combination of GlcIFG and NAP-DNJ gave a greater reduction than either agent alone, suggesting an additive antiviral effect from inhibiting both the \u03b1-glucosidase I/II and endomannosidase pathways. The addition of NAP-DNJ not only inhibits calnexin-mediated folding and quality control, but also requires viral glycans to undergo processing by MANEA, hence potentiating the antiviral effect. To further define the antiviral potential of MANEA inhibitors, we extended these studies to DENV. The MANEA inhibitors GlcIFG, GlcDMJ, CyMe-GlcIFG, and ManIFG were used to study levels of viral particle formation and infectivity. Viral",
