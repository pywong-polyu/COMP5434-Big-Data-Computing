We sought to investigate the presence of maternal viremia in people with SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy who had histologic placentitis versus those without placentitis. SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR was performed on plasma from 6 patients with COVID placentitis and 12 matched controls without placentitis. SARS-CoV-2 infection occurred between 4/2020-1/2021; the latency between SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis and delivery was 0-76 days. Two placentitis cases demonstrated viremia (1 stillbirth and 1 well infant), while 12/12 controls were negative. Future research may consider viremia as a possible marker of COVID placentitis.",

Perinatal pathologists have identified specific placental pathology, termed COVID placentitis, associated with a high risk of stillbirth and poor neonatal outcome [3, 4] . COVID placentitis, characterized by histiocytic intervillositis, increased perivillous fibrin deposition, and villous trophoblast necrosis, has been associated with direct viral infection of the syncytiotrophoblast layer of the placenta. Placentitis represents a clinical dilemma to obstetric providers as it can only be diagnosed on examination of the placenta after delivery. We hypothesized that, due to the interface between syncytiotrophoblast and maternal blood, patients with COVID placentitis would be more likely to demonstrate viremia than SARS-CoV-2-infected patients without placentitis.",

First, the Ct values reported here are near or below the commonly used limit of detection (Ct value 35) for the CDC SARS-CoV-2 qRT-PCR assay used here. To mitigate the risk of false positive detection, we performed at least 4 technical replicates of each tentative positive sample, sequence verified on-target amplification, and included matched controls, none of which amplified. Nevertheless, the risk of false positives in widespread deployment remains possible. Additionally, while viremia was present in all 3 stillbirth cases reported (2 from Shook et al., 1 from this series), viremia was not detected in some placentitis cases we tested, including one case with diffuse placental involvement on pathological examination. Thus, while the presence of viremia may portend an increased risk of placentitis-mediated stillbirth, the absence of detectable viremia may not exclude placentitis. Notably, 2 of the 6 cases of placentitis had >60 day latency between infection and maternal sample. Thus, transient viremia at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection cannot be excluded. Further near-term research is needed to consider low-level viremia as a possible marker of COVID placentitis. ",
