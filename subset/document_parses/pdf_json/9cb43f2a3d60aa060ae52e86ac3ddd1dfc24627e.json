In the present study, temperature, relative humidity, carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration, and median particle size diameter measurements were taken into account. These parameters were analyzed in a computer classroom with 15 subjects during a normal 90-minute class; all the subjects wore surgical masks. For measurements, Arduino YUN, Arduino UNO, and APS-3321 devices were used. Natural ventilation efficiency was checked in two different ventilation scenarios: only windows open and windows and doors open. The results show how ventilation affects the temperature, CO 2 concentration, and median particle diameter size parameters. By contrast, the relative humidity depends more on the outdoor meteorological conditions. Both ventilation scenarios tend to create the same room conditions in terms of temperature, humidity, CO 2 concentration, and particle size. Additionally, the evolution of CO 2 concentration as well as the particle size distribution along the time was studied. Finally, the particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) was investigated together with particle concentration. Both parameters showed a similar trend during the time of the experiments.",

This is even more crucial in environments where many people need to coexist for several hours. Poor air quality is usually understood as an excessively high concentration of particulate matter (PM). However, CO 2 is also a critical component with respect to the quality of indoor air and should be reduced via ventilation. This phenomenon is intensified in classrooms, which are usually crowded, overheated, and poorly ventilated. This results in a possible increase in carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which could be dangerous if the concentration level exceeds the value of 0.15 percentage value of CO 2 (1500 ppm) or even lower levels (1000 ppm). According to Persily [12] , indoor carbon dioxide concentrations are important and have played a role in discussions related to ventilation and indoor air quality (IAQ). The relevance of CO 2 concentrations to ventilation and IAQ standards is based on their correlation to indoor levels of bio-effluents and associated odors and to ventilation rates per person. Hou et al. [13] summarized the main studies focusing on the indoor air quality of classrooms. They also studied the correlation of CO 2 and PM 2.5 (indoor and outdoor ratios) concentrations in classrooms, relating the data to the ventilation rates in classrooms and the classroom occupancy. Rumchev et al. [14] also concluded that populations with a high rate of poverty are a greater risk of suffering problems related to lung health due to the lack of basic ventilation equipment such as chimneys and even windows.",

            "text": "With the purpose of measuring the air quality and the efficiency of ventilation, Dinh et al. [17] noted that CO 2 should be measured as an indicator. If ventilation is controlled by the monitoring of CO 2 levels in indoor environments, people can be prevented from acquiring many diseases, especially those related to respiratory viral infections. CO 2 is an important parameter to measure because it is a marker of the air that has been exhaled and can be linked to the probability of infection through the Well-Riley equation. CO 2 particles are denser than air; however, they are carried with the flow as virus particles would be. CO 2 being higher than a certain level indicates that the ventilation is inadequate, and measures should be taken. Bhagat et al. [18] determined that one of the most efficient strategies for reducing exposure risk seems to be displacement ventilation. When this strategy is designed properly, it helps with vertical stratification and removes polluted warm air near the ceiling. Additionally, wearing face coverings is an effective measure as it reduces the direct ejection of droplets and bio-aerosols. Furthermore, they recommended avoiding mixed ventilation strategies, since that can distribute air through a room and does not provide clean zones. Wang et al. [19] discussed the feasibility of displacement ventilation in schools along with a heat recovery pump. Through this system, classroom air quality has been enhanced, while the energy consumption of the building is reduced. Computational fluid dynamics software (CFD) was used to demonstrate the technical feasibility of this development. Li et al. [20] introduced an innovative alternative ventilator, replacing one part of the window frame with a ventilator whose core component is a cross-flow fan (CFF).",

The most used numerical techniques include CFD technology; see Chillon et al. [23] . Several researchers revealed important information about the exhalation of microparticles during different breathing actions. In this manner, Dbouk et al. [24] demonstrated that 2 m is a safe face-to-face distance between humans to prevent COVID-19 infections only in no stream situations. The same authors corroborated in [25] that using face masks greatly reduces the number of released droplets in the environment. Using face masks also increases droplets' evaporation ratio, due to the fact that droplet clouds are less dense. According to Feng et al. [26] , relative humidity (RH) does not affect the droplets' trajectories but interferes with their evaporation. Aliabadi et al. [27] mentioned that small droplets evaporate more quickly at low RH. Vuorinen et al. [28] added that complete droplet evaporation leads to the appearance of a solid residue. These residues accumulate, forming a suspended cloud called an aerosol. These aerosols travel on air streams. Yang et al. [29] recommended controlling indoor RH to control this manner of spreading droplets. On the other hand, Shao et al. [30] suggested designing effective ventilation strategies to disperse aerosol clouds safely.",

Furthermore, a GUI was developed on Matlab that graphically displays the temperature, humidity, and CO 2 in real time for each sensor. Once the experiment was concluded, the data were saved in an Excel file. Between different techniques of particle sizing, the aerodynamic approach was chosen for the current study. Therefore, an Aerodynamic Particle Sizer (APS) spectrometer was used to measure the aerosol microparticles' sizes inside the classroom. This device model (APS-3321; TSI Incorporated, MN, USA) was successfully used in Aramendia et al. [31] for measuring the nebulized particle size distributions. The aerosol, drawn into the APS inlet, is immediately split into a sample flow through the inner nozzle, and a sheath flow through the outer nozzle. This device generates a signal every time a particle crosses two laser beams placed within the inlet nozzle, providing high-resolution measurements for droplets between 0.5 and 20 \u00b5m (see Figure 2 ). The acceleration of droplets, due to inertia, is smaller for larger droplets. Therefore, the APS theory operation to calculate this acceleration is based on the time between the peaks of the signal produced by the two laser beams, also known as the time of flight. Then, the APS memory, which must initially be calibrated, converts each time-of-flight measurement recorded to the corresponding aerodynamic particle diameter, described as the diameter of a spherical particle with a density of a water droplet (1000 kg/m 3 ) that has the same settling velocity as the measured particle. Pfeifer et al. [32] noticed that the sizing error rarely exceeds 10%. Collected data were acquired, analyzed, and stored by means of the APS 3321 processing software package AIM (TSI Incorporated). Chen et al. [33] described the mathematical models that AIM software used to calculate the quantity of suctioned particles and their size. APS converts each time-of-flight measurement into its corresponding aerodynamic particle diameter (Da).

In both cases, the observed trends were similar. This was an increase in concentrations of PM 2.5 and particles in ventilation situations and decreases in situations with a lack of ventilation. At higher ventilation rates, with windows and doors open, the increasing gradients were higher than at slower ventilation rates or in no-ventilation situations. Figure 6 illustrates how, in the scenario with people inside, the PM 2.5 and particle concentration values showed some irregularities between them. In contrast, in the empty classroom scenario, similar trends in PM 2.5 and particle concentration values over time were seen in the four proposed ventilation situations.
