However, the discovery of the components of these cannabis derivatives and their mechanism of action have been elucidated only in the recent decades. Indeed, the main psychoactive component of Cannabis sativa, 9-tetrahydrocannabinol, was isolated in 1964, by the group of Prof Mechoulam, whereas the main components of the endocannabionoid system, the cannabinoid receptors, their endogenous ligands, and the enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of these endocannabinoids, have been identified in the 80 and 90 decades ( Mechoulam and Parker, 2012 ) .",

This recreational use produces major drawbacks in our modern societies with particular deleterious consequences in young adolescents that present important prevalence of consumption starting at early periods of age. Cannabis consumption in these early periods may have major long-term consequences in brains and personalities that are still under a complex developing process of maturation. Large efforts must be made by scientists, physicians and regulatory authorities to aware our young citizens about the risks of cannabis consumption in these early ages. In addition, the pattern of cannabis consumption has been drastically modified in these last months due to the COVID-19 disease that became a global pandemic on March 11th 2020 changing the daily life of our societies and leading to important changes in the rate of consumption of cannabis and alcohol, among other drugs of abuse.",

            "text": "On the other hand, cannabis derivatives represent pharmacological tools of enormous interest in terms of developing novel possible medications. Indeed, these compounds induce their pharmacological effects by acting in two main receptors, CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, that are very abundant in specific organs of our body that are crucial for the control of multiple physiological functions and the development of several physiopathological processes. CB1 cannabinoid receptors are the most abundant seven transmembrane domain receptor in the brain and they are crucial mediators in the control of multiple central physiological functions including emotional and cognitive responses, rewarding stimuli, pain, emesis and food intake, among many others ( Mechoulam and Parker, 2012 ) . CB2 receptors are abundant in the different tissues of the immune system and are key elements in the regulation of the immune responses ( Dhopeshwarkar and Mackie, 2014 ) . The abundance of both receptors in these two systems and the crucial role that they play in their physiological control provides unique targets for therapeutic purposes that have not been yet exploited. The activity of these receptors can be modulated by direct agonists and antagonists, but also through pharmacological compounds able to modify the levels of endocannabinoids acting on their synthesis, re-uptake and enzymatic degradation systems. All these tools represent unique opportunities for opening novel therapeutic strategies and research on this topic should be promoted to facilitate the possible development of clinical trials that allow to identify the real therapeutic utility of cannabis components and of other cannabinoid ligands.",
