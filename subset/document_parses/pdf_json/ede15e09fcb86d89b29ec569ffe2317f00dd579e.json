            "text": "In this paper, a new way to integrate volatility information for estimating value at risk (VaR) and conditional value at risk (CVaR) of a portfolio is suggested. The new method is developed from the perspective of Bayesian statistics and it is based on the idea of volatility clustering. By specifying the hyperparameters in a conjugate prior based on two different rolling window sizes, it is possible to quickly adapt to changes in volatility and automatically specify the degree of certainty in the prior. This constitutes an advantage in comparison to existing Bayesian methods that are less sensitive to such changes in volatilities and also usually lack standardized ways of expressing the degree of belief. We illustrate our new approach using both simulated and empirical data. Compared to some other well known homoscedastic and heteroscedastic models, the new method provides a good alternative for risk estimation, especially during turbulent periods where it can quickly adapt to changing market conditions.",

One of the main advantages of the Bayesian approach compared to traditional plug-in methods is that the Bayesian methodology makes it possible to employ useful prior information. How to include such prior information has been a topic of interest during the last decades and several different approaches have been suggested. A well known method was proposed by Black and Litterman (1992) who provided an informal Bayesian model based on market equilibrium arguments. Another popular approach was suggested by P\u00e1stor (2000) and P\u00e1stor and Stambaugh (2000) in which asset pricing models were used to include prior information. Tu and Zhou (2010) also suggested a Bayesian model where priors were imposed on the solution of a problem rather than on the original model parameters. Although these methods provide good ways to specify the prior belief, they do not enable a systematic quantification of the certainty in that belief. This puts the investor in a difficult position since it is generally not obvious how certain he or she should be in the prior.",

All trading desks that are bounded by these regulations must perform regular backtesting of their risk models. The backtesting procedure required by Basel is based on a binomial test of a 'hit sequence' where each number in the sequence is 1 if the daily VaR has been exceeded and 0 if it has not been exceeded. Hence it resembles the testing procedure suggested by Christoffersen (1998) . Based on the outcome of the test, different capital requirements are imposed on the bank and models that perform badly will even be prohibited.",

Recently, Kerkhof and Melenberg (2004) and Du and Escanciano (2017) investigated what effect the estimation uncertainty has on exceedances of VaR in the case of a single asset. Both papers derived the variance of the asymptotic distributions of the suggested test statistics. They deduced that the effect can be large, depending on the ratio of the out-of-sample and in-sample period. However, the application of Bayesian methods completely avoids this issue, since it automatically takes the estimation error into account.",

A well-known characteristic of asset returns is that large or small deviations tend to group together in time. This can clearly be seen in financial data from, for instance, the financial crises in 2008 or, more recently, the Covid-19 outbreak in 2020. This phenomenon is known as volatility clustering and it has been documented in numerous articles (see, e.g., Ding et al., 1993; Ding and Granger, 1996) . Different models have been suggested to cope with this, most notably the GARCH model (Engle, 1982) . However, due to the dimensionality issue of the full multivariate GARCH model, the less general DCC-GARCH model is commonly used to model multiple financial assets (Engle, 2002) . The model has also been applied to estimate VaR and CVaR of portfolios (see, e.g., Lee et al., 2006; Santos et al., 2013) . However, fitting a DCC-GARCH model is still quite computationally demanding since it usually involves maximizing a potentially complicated likelihood function. Moreover, there is no guarantee that a global optimum is reached.",
