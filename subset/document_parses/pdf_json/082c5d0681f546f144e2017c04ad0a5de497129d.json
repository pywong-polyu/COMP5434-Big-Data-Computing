The differentiation of active from latent tuberculosis and other conditions may be aided by transcriptomic profiling [13] . The exaggerated inflammation that characterizes HIV-tuberculosis-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is triggered by Toll-like receptor and inflammasome signalling [14] .

Are there inferences that can be made from this very detailed study of susceptibility to tuberculosis conferred by diabetes? Male sex and diabetes have been identified in virtually every study as risk factors for severe COVID-19 infection, associated in the largest study to date with an adjusted hazard ratio for in-hospital death of 1.99 (male sex) and 1.50 for controlled (HbA1c < 58 mmol/mol) and 2.36 for uncontrolled DM [18] . The pulmonary innate immune response in COVID-19 patients with severe disease implicates a macrophage subpopulation with an interferon-associated hyperinflammatory response analogous to that observed in TB patients [19] . Type 1 and 2 interferon stimulation increases angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), the receptor for SARS-CoV2, expression on respiratory epithelial cells. In particular, lungs of patients with HIV-associated TB show A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 the highest expression of ACE2 in epithelial cells, compared to lungs of patients with TB only and healthy lungs [20] . HIV-1 infection, prior to antiretroviral therapy (ART) also induces a similar interferon signalling gene (ISG) profile to that of TB patients, a pattern also implicated in the context of HIV-TB co-infection, even prior to TB symptom onset [16] . Given these findings, it is plausible that individuals with HIV-1 and/or TB infection could be at increased risk of SARS-CoV2 infection not only via immunosuppression but also via increased ACE2 expression, predisposing to enhanced viral uptake.

DM increased the magnitude of gene expression change in the host transcriptome in tuberculosis, notably showing an increase in genes associated with innate inflammatory and decrease in adaptive immune responses. Patients with intermediate hyperglycaemia and tuberculosis exhibited blood transcriptomes more similar to DMtuberculosis patients than to patients with only tuberculosis. Both DM-tuberculosis and intermediate hyperglycaemia-tuberculosis patients had a decreased type I interferon response and a relatively stronger neutrophil component relative to tuberculosis-only patients, suggesting skewing of the TB transcriptome phenotype. Such immunological dysfunction is also present in individuals with intermediate hyperglycaemia, showing that altered immunity to tuberculosis may also be present in this group. The authors conclude that tuberculosis disease outcomes in individuals with IH diagnosed with TB should be investigated further.",

Another recent report documents the coincidence of COVID-19 and tuberculosis[22].Another aspect suggested by the pneumonia elicited by SARS-CoV2 infection is the capacity to enhance TB progression in subclinical and latently infected individuals. The SARS-CoV2 immunological milieu, dominated by IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF), is determined by single cell RNA sequencing (to be orchestrated by inflammatory monocytes that differentiate into various macrophage sublineages, with the proportional representation of sublineages defining the difference between patients with mild or severe disease development[19]. Bronchoalveolar lavage from patients who developed severe pneumonia possessed a unique macrophage population that expressed high levels of inflammatory chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11) and ISGs (APOBEC3A, ISG15, ISG20, GBP1, GBP5, IFITM3, MX1) which are similarly upregulated in TB and HIV-TB patients[16]. Thus, the lung immunological milieu elicited in COVID-19 patients has the potential to exacerbate TB immunopathogenesis in those with latent TB infection, and increase their risk of TB progression.Lastly neutrophil activation in the form of release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NET) has also been suggested to contribute to the severe pneumonia of COVID-19. Neutrophilia also predicts poor outcome in patients with COVID-19. In autopsy samples from 3 COVID-19 patients, neutrophil infiltration into pulmonary capillaries with fibrin deposition and extravasation into the alveolar space was observed [23]. In addition the sera of patients with COVID-19 patients have elevated levels of myeloperoxidase-DNA, and citrullinated ; both specific markers of NET formation [24]. Thus the factors that underly neutrophilic skewing of the transcriptomic response of diabetics to tuberculosis may also contribute to severe pathology in COVID-19. What are the practical consequences? Lower-and middle-income countries are as yet to experience the full brunt of the COVID-19 epidemic. Yet many already have the rising coincidence of DM and endemic tuberculosis. Routine services for both diseases have been disrupted by the initial necessarily vertical approach to COVID-19 control. Good glycaemic control should be emphasised in known diabetics as well as stringent social distancing and shielding as necessary. There is no global policy on the treatment of latent tuberculosis in diabetics: a priority question now urgently in need of evidence. Longitudinal clinicoepidemiologic studies or registers of overlap between DM, COVID-19 and tuberculosis are pressing to advise risk and potential need to change policy.",
