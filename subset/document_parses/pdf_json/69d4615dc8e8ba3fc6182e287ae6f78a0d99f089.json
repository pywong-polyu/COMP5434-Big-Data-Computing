The analysis shows how cross-fertilisation of ideas happens between legal systems around the world when tackling common jurisprudential issues, while at the same time, local considerations mould and shape the particular responses that are required for law to be both effective and ethically sensitive in a given context.",

Regular readers of this journal will know that coverage has been uneven in terms of attracting contributions from the full range of countries that make up the Asian region. It is for this reason that we are particularly honoured to publish our first paper that pertains to Bhutan, or more specifically to the plight of Bhutanese refugees in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic. Thus, McGuire et al. (https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s41649-021-00183-1) offer the first of two papers to be published in two consecutive issues of the journal that examine the mental health needs of resettled Bhutanese refugees in the USA. In this first paper, the authors give an account of the history and reported experiences of members of the Nepali-speaking Bhutanese population who have participated in other pieces of research. Through a qualitative systematic review of the literature and a comparison of the experiences of Bhutanese refugees and other refugee populations going through resettlement processes, this paper reveals both specific social determinants impacting mental health for the Bhutanese refugees as well as similarities across refugee groups. This evidence base lays the foundation for a public health justice framework and recommendations that form the second paper that will appear in the journal in January 2022. This coincides with a change to our publishing schedule: issues will now appear in January, April, July and October of each year.",

However, the experiences of citizens themselves have featured less prominently and it is for this reason that the paper by Siddiqui and Qamar (https:// link. sprin ger. com/ artic le/ 10. 1007/ s41649-021-00181-3) is particularly important and valuable. It captures evidence from Pakistani citizens from April 2020, very shortly after the pandemic was announced by the World Health Organization on 11 March 2020. As well as recounting what are-by now-some globally common and understandable reactions to the threat of infection and to government-imposed restrictions on liberty and free movement, this paper also provides insights about the influences of beliefs about what the pandemic might represent and how people of the Islamic faith should respond. The findings show that religious faith provided an important personal coping mechanism for many during those early days. Equally, the paper raises important wider questions about how to strike a balance between the religious interpretation of scriptural sources and the public health implications and diktats of dealing with a pandemic such as COVID-19 in countries that follow Islam, already being discussed elsewhere (Shabana 2021) .",

In contrast to much of the work published to date on the ethics of AI, which is often engaged in discussion of the \"rightness\" or \"wrongness\" of developments in AI itself and potential applications, this extensive study of almost 500 college students in Japan-two-thirds of whom where non-Japanese citizens-reveals a range of concerns prioritised from a list of ethical issues provided by the authors and on which the students were invited to reflect critically. The results can be read in the paper itself; the overarching conclusion is that robust moral awareness among this cohort was rather limited, and the recommendation is made that more curriculum development is required on the ethics of AI.",

As outlined above, this paper is a very good example of how legal systems influence and infect each other across the globe, while it also provides a well-grounded normative case for discussing how Hong Kong should respond to liability arising from errors in dispensing medicine against the backdrop of a discussion of local developments, regulatory approaches and Hong Kong's own cultural context.",

(https:// link. sprin ger. com/ artic le/ 10. 1007/ s41649-021-00177-z) presents the experiences of a Bioethics Consultation Service in an urban hospital in the USA in the first nine months of the COVID-19 pandemic, reflecting to some extent the paper by Siddiqui and Qamar in capturing early experience of reacting to this new global threat. As well as noting a significant increase in the incidence of bioethics consults and an account of the nature of the consults themselves, the paper is analytically valuable for its reflections on how the service was affected by the advent of the pandemic and for what these experiences mean for our understandings of vulnerability during such times of crisis.",

(https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s41649-021-00180-4) reports on religious perspectives pertaining to precision medicine in Singapore in the wake of the launch of the National Precision Medicine Strategy. In something of a variation on more standard engagement exercises with publics, the authors held a workshop to seek the views of religious authorities in Singapore, inviting them to share their perspectives on precision medicine more generally, and on data sharing more specifically with public and private sectors organisations. Again, without wishing to pre-empt the reporting of the results in the article itself, this paper is a valuable contribution to furthering the remit of the Asian Bioethics Review as an illustration of how many commonly shared values and concerns influence attitudes towards novel bioethical issues and technological developments. It is further evidence that we may have far more in common between us than what might potentially divide us.",
