Given that the number of patients in severe respiratory failure may soon exceed the number of ventilators currently available in Canadian hospitals, interim measures are needed to prevent rationing decisions until new ventilators are available.",

Recently, the provincial veterinary society also became engaged.",

Through this strategy, we identified at least 91 candidate anesthetic machines. These data have now been made available to the Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care. It should be emphasized that industry partners should be informed about any redistribution of these machines as the situation evolves, to ensure the provision of the consumable items as required.",

On 25 March 2020, Health Canada released a document entitled Notice: Importation or sale of ventilators -use of US FDA guidance and Canadian requirements for authorization under the Interim Order, 2 which refers to U.S. Food and Drug Administration guidelines. 3 These documents are valuable references for both hospitals and physicians.",

In addition, strategies to protect anesthetic machines from contamination have also been published by the Anesthesia Patient Safety Foundation. 5 We hope this information will be helpful to our colleagues in other provinces who are seeking options for the provision of emergency ICU ventilator care with anesthetic machines during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
