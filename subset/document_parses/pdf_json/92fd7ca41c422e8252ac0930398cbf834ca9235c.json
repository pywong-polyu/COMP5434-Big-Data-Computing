            "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has seen one of the first large-scale uses of digital contact tracing to track a chain of infection and contain the spread of a virus. The new technology has posed challenges both for governments aiming at high and effective uptake and for citizens weighing its benefits (e.g., protecting others' health) against the potential risks (e.g., loss of data privacy). Our cross-sectional survey with repeated measures across four samples in Germany ( N = 4357 ) focused on psychological factors contributing to the public adoption of digital contact tracing. We found that public acceptance of privacy-encroaching measures (e.g., granting the government emergency access to people's medical records or location tracking data) decreased over the course of the pandemic. Intentions to use contact tracing apps-hypothetical ones or the Corona-Warn-App launched in Germany in June 2020-were high. Users and non-users of the Corona-Warn-App differed in their assessment of its risks and benefits, in their knowledge of the underlying technology, and in their reasons to download or not to download the app. Trust in the app's perceived security and belief in its effectiveness emerged as psychological factors playing a key role in its adoption. We incorporate our findings into a behavioral framework for digital contact tracing and provide policy recommendations.",

The last two waves probed respondents' attitudes toward the Corona-Warn-App itself (see Appendix Table B4 for descriptions of the scenarios). We also collected a variety of attitude measures, such as worldviews and COVID-19 risk perceptions, in order to identify potential psychological predictors of policy acceptance (see \"Methods\" for details). Strengths of our approach include the ability to compare attitudes toward three hypothetical scenarios (in the earlier waves) with actual adoption rates of the Corona-Warn-App (in the later waves). Our cross-sectional study with large representative online samples thus allows us to identify the psychological factors behind the adoption of digital contact tracing technologies, and to examine how those factors change over time.",

As Fig. 4 shows, the acceptability of privacyencroaching measures that could hypothetically be implemented by the government (e.g., temporarily suspending data protection regulations) was fairly high, but tended to decrease over time. Whereas respondents' risk perceptions tracked the pandemic's development in Germany-that is, perceived risk for the country as a whole was higher at the end of March and April (Waves 1 and 2, respectively) and November (Wave 4), when infections were rising (Fig. 3 )-respondents' attitudes toward privacy-encroaching measures followed a different pattern. After the initial shock of the pandemic, the acceptability of all measures tended to decrease from thereon, as reflected in the decreasing percentages of people who deemed these measures \"very\" or \"somewhat\" acceptable. Cochran-Armitage tests for trend corroborate the decreasing rates of acceptability across four study waves, especially for the first four measures in Fig. 4 ( p < 0.001 ). For the other two measures (temporarily relaxing data protection regulations and collecting data on contacts and interactions) there was an indication of a decreasing trend ( p = 0.01 and p = 0.02 , respectively; see Supplementary Table A2 for detailed results).",

Measures such as allowing access to medical records or location tracking data fall into the first pattern. Granting the government access to citizens' medical records was deemed \"very\" or \"somewhat\" acceptable by 68% of participants in Wave 1; this number dropped in each wave, reaching just 35% in Wave 4 despite the rise in infections and new lockdown measures at that time. Acceptability of collecting people's location tracking data followed the same pattern (Fig. 4) . In contrast, measures such as collecting data on people's infections and immunity status or their contacts and interactions seemed to be more responsive to the pandemic's development and associated risk perceptions (see also Supplementary Fig. A3 for correlations between acceptability of privacy-encroaching measures and COVID-19 risk perceptions). For example, 49% of respondents found collecting data on people's contacts and interactions to be \"somewhat\" or \"very\" acceptable at the end of March, during the first phase of the pandemic in Germany. This decreased over the next two waves, then rose to 45% in November, mirroring the increase in infections in Germany at that time. Note, however, that acceptance of this measure stayed below 50% across all four waves of the study.",

We found relatively high levels of acceptance of the three tracking technologies presented in the hypothetical scenarios in Waves 1 and 2 (mild, severe, and Bluetooth). Acceptability of all three was above 50% in both waves. There were no large differences between proportions of respondents who found acceptable the three hypothetical scenarios (Fig. 5) . Surprisingly, although the severe scenario was deemed least acceptable (56% in Wave 1 and 55% in Wave 2 compared to 61% and 64%, respectively, for the mild scenario and 59% in Wave 2 for Bluetooth), its acceptance level was not particularly low. The differences between scenarios virtually disappeared when respondents considered follow-up options (e.g., deletion of all data after 6 months or opting out of data collection). The reported percentage of downloads of the Corona-Warn-App in our samples was smaller (36% and 41% in Waves 3 and 4, respectively) than the acceptability of the hypothetical scenarios. This low number of reported downloads is consistent with the actual download rates for the Corona-Warn-App in Germany (currently estimated at about 30% of the population; see Supplementary Fig. A1 ). The somewhat higher download rate reported here might be explained by the demographics of our sample, which was skewed toward online users aged 18 years or older. When respondents in Waves 3 and 4 were asked whether the Corona-Warn-App should be mandatory, only 29% and 30%, respectively, said yes (Supplementary Table A5 ). This could indicate that people were less likely to find tracking technologies acceptable at later stages of the pandemic (consistent with the trend in Fig. 4) ; it could also indicate a difference in participants' perceptions of hypothetical scenarios and the actual app: The latter leaves less room for interpretation when participants answer the survey questions. Acceptability scores represent the total percentage of participants who chose the response options \"very acceptable\" or \"somewhat acceptable\" to the question \"How acceptable is it for the government to take the following measures to limit the spread of the virus during the COVID-19 pandemic?\" Error bars are 95% confidence intervals computed with the R function prop.test; results of this test are reported in Supplementary  Table A3 . p values from Cochran-Armitage tests for trend shown in gray boxes above the barplots; see Supplementary Table A2 www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Participants understood that the severe scenario posed a greater risk to data privacy and data sensitivity, control over user data, and ability to decline participation than the other hypothetical scenarios. At the same time, they judged the potential effectiveness of the severe scenario to be on the same level as in the other two scenarios (mild and Bluetooth). It is therefore puzzling that the acceptability of the severe scenario was almost on par with the other two (see Fig. 5 ), even though participants thought the risk to privacy protection and the level of intrusion in citizens' lives was much higher. Figure 6 also shows that although participants thought the Corona-Warn-App presented only a low risk of harm, they were pessimistic about its effectiveness, including its ability to reduce the spread of the virus and to help people return to their normal activities. This pessimism toward the Corona-Warn-App was stronger than that toward the hypothetical scenarios presented in earlier waves of the study. Moreover, participants showed only moderate levels of trust in the Corona-Warn-App's security (including trust in collection of only necessary data and only for the purposes related to the pandemic, trust in privacy protection and trust in data security from third parties)-closest to that found in the mild scenario, but higher than that in the severe and Bluetooth scenarios. Given that the technology in the Bluetooth scenario was attributed to Apple and Google, while the Corona-Warn-App was released by the German government, the lower level of trust in the Bluetooth scenario may be due to a lack of trust in commercial corporations and their standards of data protection.",

Reasons against downloading the app include technical issues (\"smartphone\"), data privacy (\"data protection\" and \"trust\"), problems of functionality (\"works\"), and doubts around how www.nature.com/scientificreports/ useful and necessary the app is (\"hold\" and \"brings [nothing]\", translated from German where these words are part of expressions that mean \"I consider\" and \"pointless\"). Overall, the reasons for not downloading the app are slightly more diverse than the reasons for downloading it; this was also the case for the multiple-choice question ( Corona-Warn-App: predictors of download. To further examine why people chose to download the Corona-Warn-App, we fitted a logistic regression model using a set of independent variables measured in the survey as predictors for the dependent variable of downloading the Corona-Warn-App (Fig. 10 ). Once again, trust in the app's security and perceived effectiveness emerged as leading positive predictors of downloading the app. These two variables represent combined measures made up of variables presented in Fig. 6 . The variable \"Trust in CWA security\" included items asking respondents how much they trusted the app to ensure individuals' privacy (\"Trust: Privacy Protection\") and to only collect and use the Corona-Warn-App data to deal with the pandemic (\"Only Necessary Data Collection\" and \"Trust: Data for Pandemic Only\"), as well as how secure they thought the data collected by the app actually is (\"Trust: Security from 3rd Party')' . The variable \"Perception of Fig. 6 . The variable \"Trust in security\" combines four variables: \"Only Necessary Data Collection, \" \"Trust: Privacy Protection, \" \"Trust: Security from 3rd Party. \" The variable \"Belief in effectiveness\" combines three variables: \"Reduce Likelihood to Contract, \" \"Reduce Spread Future, \" \"Return to Activity Future. \" \"Risk of harm\" is a single variable. For items, see Appendix  Tables B6 and for www.nature.com/scientificreports/ CWA effectiveness\" included items asking for people's assessment of whether the app will help reduce the virus's spread (\"Reduce Spread Future\"), reduce their likelihood of coming into contact with the virus (\"Reduce Likelihood to Contract\"), and help them return to their normal activities (\"Return to Activity Future\"). This variable therefore represents people's assessment of the app's potential to impact the course of the pandemic and help them personally (see Supplementary Table B10 for all predictor variables). www.nature.com/scientificreports/ As trust in the app's security and perceived effectiveness emerged as strong predictors of having downloaded the Corona-Warn-App, we used the same modeling approach to assess predictors of both of these variables separately. Supplementary Figures A10 and A11 show the results of the respective linear regression models. Acceptance of privacy limits during the pandemic (a combined measure summarizing all six items discussed under \"Acceptability of Privacy-Encroaching Measures\" and in Fig. 4 ) and trust in science and government guidelines emerged as moderate positive predictors of both variables. Furthermore, believing in conspiracy narratives and perceiving the Corona-Warn-App as harmful were associated with lower trust in the app's security, but not with the perception of its effectiveness. Demographic factors such as a high level of education and identifying as male-but not age-also emerged as positive predictors of having downloaded the Corona-Warn-App. As Supplementary Fig. A5 shows, proportions of respondents who reported having downloaded the app were higher at high and medium levels of education than at a low level: For instance, 46% of participants with a university degree had downloaded the app, relative to just 29% (Wave 3) and 35% (Wave 4) of participants with a low level of education. Slightly more male respondents (Wave 3: 44%, Wave 4: 40%) than female respondents (Wave 3: 38%, Wave 4: 32%) reported having downloaded the Corona-Warn-App. Supplementary Table B10 ). Horizontal point ranges show point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each predictor. Education was dummy coded with the reference level \"medium, \" yielding two coefficients: low (vs. medium) and high (vs. medium) education. Following 30 , we standardized all continuous variables by two standard deviations (SD) and mean centered the binary gender variable. This way a 2-SD change in a continuous predictor variable is approximately equivalent to a change of category in a roughly balanced binary predictor variable (e.g., gender). In a logistic regression model, a slope reflects the relative change in log odds (while keeping all other predictors at their average values). Supplementary www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Finally, we used logistic regression models to analyze the intention to download the Corona-Warn-App among respondents who reported that they had not already done so. Perceived effectiveness of the app emerged as the strongest predictor of intention to download (Fig. 11 ) in both Waves 3 and 4. This finding is in line with self-reported reasons for not downloading the app, where effectiveness concerns (along with privacy concerns) played a large role (see Fig. 8 ).",

The apps were launched with high hopes, but have also posed a number of challenges both for governments aiming at high and effective uptake and for citizens weighing the benefits (e.g., public and individual health) against the potential risks (e.g., loss of data privacy) of these unprecedented measures. Although their epidemiological impact is presently limited or uncertain (Ref. 10 ; but see Ref. 11 ), digital contact tracing apps are poised to become an established epidemiological tool. Ideally, along with other measures, they can help to prevent large outbreaks by relieving the burden on public health agencies. With this potential in mind, it is crucial to understand which factors contribute to the public uptake of digital contact tracing apps. In the present survey Figure 11 . Logistic regression models for intention to download the Corona-Warn-App (Waves 3 and 4). Dependent variable: intention to download the app in the future (yes/no). Coefficients: measures from the survey (e.g., combined score for trust in app security; combined score for conspiracy beliefs; see Supplementary  Table B10 ). Horizontal point ranges indicate point estimates and 95% confidence intervals for each predictor. Education was dummy coded with the reference level \"medium, \" yielding two coefficients: low (vs. medium) and high (vs. medium) education. Following 30 , we standardized all continuous variables by two standard deviations (SD) and mean centered the binary gender variable. This way a 2-SD change in a continuous predictor variable is approximately equivalent to a change of category in a roughly balanced binary predictor variable (e.g., gender). In a logistic regression model, a slope reflects the relative change in log odds (while keeping all other predictors at their average values). Supplementary Table A7 summarizes the regression results for both models. Supplementary Figure A9 provides an alternative arrangement of the same results, where the respective model for each wave is shown in a separate panel. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ in Germany, we focused on psychological factors that foster or inhibit the public adoption of digital contact tracing technologies. Research on risk perception has identified several psychological drivers that figure in people's risk-benefit calculations and contribute to the acceptance of novel technologies (see Refs. [31] [32] [33] [34] . A first factor is the subjective perception of risks, including a risk's severity, defined in terms of perceived lack of control and catastrophic potential (\"dread risks\"), and novelty, defined in terms of unobservable and unpredictable consequences and their potential harm (\"unknown risks\"; see Ref. 31 ). A second factor is the perception of benefits, both personal (e.g., returning to normal activities, avoiding infection) and public (curbing the virus's spread; see also Refs. 32 ). A third and related factor is individuals' degree of knowledge and experience of a technology, which facilitates or precludes accurate assessment of its risks and benefits (e.g., Ref. 35 , see also Ref. 36 ). A fourth factor is trust in the authorities that develop, deploy, or supervise the technology. The trust factor becomes particularly important in the absence of knowledge about technology, as a way to cope with the complexity of the task by relying on experts or relevant authorities for risk management 33, 36 . An additional factor to consider in risk-benefit assessments of digital contact tracing technologies is the context (e.g., the risk posed by the pandemic itself) and its development (e.g., whether infection rates are decreasing or increasing). For example, people might be willing to overlook risks to their privacy temporarily in order to mitigate the health risks posed by the pandemic. Results of our study speak to several of these factors, as summarized in the following sections.",

Acceptability of all six hypothetical privacy-encroaching measures across the four waves was correlated with people's COVID-19 risk perceptions (see Supplementary Fig. A3 ). Moreover, our results suggest that people might distinguish between measures they considered to be more appropriate during the pandemic (e.g., collecting data on infections and immunity status) and measures that were initially deemed acceptable but whose acceptability gradually decreased over time (e.g., granting access to medical records or location tracking data).",

Although users were, on average, more optimistic about the app's effectiveness than non-users, beliefs in the app's effectiveness were in general not high-as also observed by Ref. 19 .

Trust in governments, scientists, and health authorities has also been shown to be a strong predictor of adherence to protective measures and guidelines during the pandemic (e.g., Refs. [38] [39] [40] . Likewise, trust has proved to be a strong predictor of people's attitudes to other novel technologies, such as 5G 34 or gene technology 33 . These converging findings support the notion that trust in relevant authorities can function as a substitute for knowledge about a technology and its risks and benefits (see Ref. 36 ).",

Our analyses highlight several factors that seem to shape people's attitudes toward digital contact tracing technologies, including privacy concerns, trust in the app's security, and beliefs about its effectiveness. In order to conceptualize the confluence and interplay of these factors, we suggest mapping them out within a behavior change framework 28 such as that shown in Fig. 12 . This framework consists of three components, whose interaction determines behavior: capability (an individual's psychological and physical capacity to engage in a behavior), opportunity (environmental affordances and external factors that enable or prompt a behavior), and motivation (mental processes that guide behavior; e.g., habits, emotions, decisions 28 ). Capability encompasses technical capacity (i.e., having a smartphone) and the skills required to download and use the app, as well as the digital skills and risk literacy necessary to understand risk warnings in the app and to communicate test results to the app. In our samples, the majority of participants had a smartphone (Table 1) , and only about 5% of participants cited not having a smartphone as a reason for not downloading the app (see Fig. 8 ). Nevertheless, technical problems related to smartphones (e.g., not having one or the app not working properly) played a prominent role in the open-response questions (see Fig. 9 ). Almost all respondents who reported having downloaded the app also reported that it was still installed on their phone (Wave 3: 92%, Wave 4: 93%) and that they kept Bluetooth switched on either always or when leaving the house (Wave 3: 95%, Wave 4: 93%; Supplementary Table A5) .",

Technical/physical factors include the app's architecture (e.g., where data are stored, the system's security) and the broader system in which it is embedded-for example, the health care system. Connecting opportunity in this behavioral framework to the factors that contribute to effectiveness presented in Fig. 1 , it is clear that a digital contact tracing app must be integrated into the national health care system in order to ensure ease of use (e.g., communicating a positive test result anonymously and without friction).",

This inventory was the same across all scenarios, with one exception: Participants in Waves 1 and 2 were asked about a hypothetical app, whereas participants in Waves 3 and 4 were asked about the Corona-Warn-App itself. All participants also completed an attention check; those who failed to correctly identify the scenario they had seen from three alternatives were excluded from the analysis. The surveys concluded by assessing respondents' political worldviews and their attitudes to hypothetical privacy-encroaching measures. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ The details of these building blocks-perceived risks, scenario, attitudes toward the scenario presented, attention check, and worldview-differed somewhat between waves. Starting in Wave 2, we also included questions tapping participants' assessment of the government's response, estimation of fatalities, and compliance with social distancing rules. From Wave 3, we added further worldview items tapping, for example, attitudes to science and technology and belief in conspiracy narratives. The scenarios also differed between waves.

In Waves 3 and 4, we also surveyed respondents' trust in science and endorsement of conspiracy beliefs. To measure conspiracy beliefs in Wave 3, we adapted a general conspiracy scale from 47 , selecting the five items with the highest item-total correlations and adding one additional item specifically tailored to the COVID-19 pandemic (\"Selfish interests have conspired to convince the public that COVID-19 is a major threat, \" designed based on the conspiracy beliefs inventory by Ref. 48 ). In Wave 4, we created our own items based on COVID-19-related conspiracy narratives that were growing in popularity at the time. To counteract this exposure to conspiracy narratives, we included a debriefing flyer developed on the basis of 49 recommendations at the end of the survey. For all worldview items, see Supplementary Table B8 .",
