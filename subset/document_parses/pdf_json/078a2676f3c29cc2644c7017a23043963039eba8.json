No effective treatment has yet been established and severe morbidity and mortality have been reported to be higher in the elderly and patients with underlying diseases [2] . COVID-19 often starts with non-specific upper respiratory tract symptoms, making it difficult to distinguish from those of other diseases [3] . In particular, influenza virus infections may present similar symptoms as those of COVID-19. The current lack of clinical knowledge about COVID-19 might, therefore, lead to bias and missed diagnoses in cases of co-existing infections. In our hospital, we encountered a case of influenza A virus and SARS-CoV-2 co-infection, which allowed us to analyse the overlapping clinical course of these two viral infections.",

            "text": "A 78-year-old woman, a non-smoker with dyslipidemia and hypothyroidism presented to her primary care physician on 13 February with general malaise and anorexia lasting several days. She did not have other symptoms, such as fever, cough, sputum, or dyspnoea. She had visited Paris, France, from 30 January to 4 February 2020. At that time, her vital signs were within normal limits, including SpO 2 (i.e., 98 % on room air) (Fig. 1A) . On 18 February, she complained of cough and exacerbation of malaise and anorexia and had an associated 3 kg body weight loss. She was referred to our hospital because of a bilateral reticular shadow seen on chest X-rays ( Fig. 1B) and ground-glass opacity (GGO) adjacent to the pleura seen on chest computed tomography (CT) (Fig. 1C, D) . At the time of her visit, she had a temperature of 37.7 C; respiratory rate, 20 breaths/min; heart rate, 106 beats/min (regular); blood pressure, 139/63 mmHg; and SPO 2 of 95 % on room air. Admission blood tests showed elevated C-reactive protein (7.9 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase (106 U/L), alanine aminotransferase (80 U/L), g-glutamyltransferase (153 U/L), alkaline phosphatase (372 U/L), and lactate dehydrogenase (383 U/L). Other blood test results were within the normal range. COVID-19 was suggested based on her prolonged clinical symptoms, travel history, and chest X-ray and CT findings. We thus performed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay of a sputum specimen for SARS-CoV-2 detection. A rapid influenza test, conducted simultaneously, was positive for influenza A virus, and she was started on oseltamivir with ceftriaxone 2 g/day and azithromycin 500 mg/day to cover possible bacterial infections.",

By 21 February, her general malaise had worsened. Chest X-ray (Fig. 1E) and CT (Fig. 1F, G) , re-examined on 25 February, showed improvements in previously noted GGO, appearing more like a consolidation. Given the improvement in her clinical symptoms and CT findings, another PCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection was performed on 26 February which tested still positive. Subsequent SARS-CoV-2 PCR testing on 1 and 2 March tested negative, and the patient was discharged on 5 March. Chest X-ray (Fig. 1H) and CT (Fig. 1I, J) images obtained a day before discharge showed improvements of previously noted consolidation and GGO.

Although the exact infection timing of the two viruses is unknown, this case reveals some important clinical features of COVID-19. Considering that the patient became afebrile one day after receiving the anti-influenza drug, oseltamivir, her initial fever at the time of admission was presumably due to influenza. Although the PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 were not yet known during fever resolution, she was still presumed to be positive COVID-19, based on the imaging findings and medical history consistent with the disease. Thus, it is important to suspect COVID-19 and respond accordingly while awaiting test results.",
