Therefore, understanding differences in the local and systemic response to SARS-CoV-2 infection between children and adults may provide important clues about the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To address this, we first generated a healthy reference multi-omics single cell data set from children (n=30) in whom we have profiled triple matched samples: nasal and tracheal brushings and PBMCs, where we track the developmental changes for 42 airway and 31 blood cell populations from infancy, through childhood to adolescence. This has revealed the presence of naive B and T lymphocytes in neonates and infants with a unique gene expression signature bearing hallmarks of innate immunity. We then contrast the healthy reference with equivalent data from severe paediatric and adult COVID-19 patients (total n=27), from the same three types of samples: upper and lower airways and blood. We found striking differences: children with COVID-19 as opposed to adults had a higher proportion of innate lymphoid and nonclonally expanded naive T cells in peripheral blood, and a limited interferon-response signature. In the airway epithelium, we found the highest viral load in goblet and ciliated cells and describe a novel inflammatory epithelial cell population. These cells represent a transitional regenerative state between secretory and ciliated cells; they were found in healthy children and were enriched in paediatric and adult COVID-19 patients. Epithelial cells display an antiviral and neutrophil-recruiting gene signature that is weaker in severe paediatric versus adult COVID-19. Our matched blood and airway samples allowed us to study the spatial dynamics of infection. Lastly, we provide a user-friendly interface for this data 1 as a highly granular reference for the study of immune responses in airways and blood in children.",

At single cell level, viral entry genes were shown to be most highly expressed in the nasal epithelium in healthy adults 14 . In children, bulk RNA sequencing analysis revealed lower ACE2 gene expression both in upper 15 and lower airways 13, 16 compared to adults, although more recent studies found no correlation with age or infection 17 .",

Changes in blood cell counts and immune cell composition throughout childhood are well described 32 , and recently CyTOF (cytometry by time-of-flight) has facilitated a higher multiplexed panel-dependent description of cell types, with studies focussing on either early childhood 29 or reporting comparison to disease 33 .

In our cell type annotation, we used a conservative approach, using a high cut-off of 1000 UMIs per cell and normalising the data set by donor identity which ensures that cell type differences are consistent between individuals. We identified a small number of melanocytes, in keeping with previously reported primary nasal mucosal melanocytes 46,47 . The major surface epithelial cell populations fall into two broad clusters, with the first covering the basal to secretory cell differentiation pathway, as visualised using Velocyto (Figure 2c) , and these include basal 1, basal 2, cycling basal, secretory, goblet 1 and 2, and squamous cells with markers as specified in is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint",

We therefore carried out differential gene expression analysis (using a multivariate random effect model; see methods) between healthy controls and COVID-19 patients, followed by a GO term enrichment analysis. For the strongly enriched inflammatory epithelial transit cells (IETCs) the DE genes in healthy versus diseased patients were enriched for interferon responsive genes (Figure 2h ) and were associated with an interferon type I, antiviral and cytokine response. When testing interferon-alpha and gamma response signatures across epithelial cell types, expression was highest in secretory and goblet cells (Extended Data Figure 5a) . Healthy children showed an interferon response that increased with age (Figure 2g) . A comparison across conditions (Figure 2g) showed that the interferon response in adult COVID-19 patients was higher than in children with COVID-19.

We generated CITE-seq data for 51 blood samples using a 192 antibody panel recognising 188 proteins. By integrating gene and protein expression data using an integrated Weighted Nearest Neighbor analysis 60 and Leiden clustering 61 , we were able to annotate our 317,854 single cells into 31 cell types (Figure 3a , quality control metrics in Extended Data Figure 7) . While the gene expression data made a greater contribution to distinguishing cell types, the protein expression data strongly contributed to defining T cell subtypes and monocytes, as visualised by pie charts in Figure   3a . Notable genes for which protein expression was more informative than RNA expression levels included CD4 in T cell subsets, NCR1 and CD56 (NCAM1) in NK cells, and CCR6 and IGHD in naive and memory B cells (Figure 3c, Extended Data Figure 8a ). CITE-seq also allowed us to distinguish between cell type-specific protein isoforms, including CD45RA and CD45RO, which are key markers of T cell maturity. While RNA marker genes were consistent with previous reports 24 , the relative contribution of protein data varied significantly between cell types (Figure 3a, Extended Data Figure 8a ). For example, for T cell subsets transcriptional data carried only slightly higher weight than the protein data, whilst plasmablasts, cycling T and NK, and haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) were almost entirely assigned on the basis of RNA expression. To validate our manual cell type annotation and assess its accuracy, we compared it to an automated annotation by Azimuth 62 . is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint This revealed that our annotation was highly similar, but not identical to automated annotation (Extended Data Figure 8b ).",

The presence of GZMA (granzyme A) in both CD4 + and CD8 + naive T cells and NKG7 (Natural killer cell granule protein 7) in only the CD8 + cells may suggest that these early naive T cells have specialised immune functions, with potentially higher cytotoxic activity.

We present a detailed study of the immune and epithelial landscapes over healthy childhood development at single cell resolution. We used this to show clear differences between the immune and airway epithelial response to SARS-CoV-2 between children and adults, while also comparing the immune response in blood and airways in the same individuals. Additionally, we identify a novel epithelial cell state which is seen in COVID-19 patients and healthy children. A key motivation for our analysis was the current COVID-19 pandemic, which frequently starts with infection of the upper airways, where we found the highest total viral load in the surface epithelial goblet and ciliated cells. Viral infections are cleared by cell death and removal of infected cells 77, 78 , which led to a highly dynamic re-structuring of the airway epithelium with a marked increase in developmental intermediates, most notably the novel inflammatory epithelial transit cell (IETC) population, which was not found in previous analysis of healthy adult airways 25, 44, 43 , and a decrease in basal progenitors that is re-balanced post-infection. Upon infection, all adult epithelial cell types showed a strong interferon response, which was markedly reduced in our paediatric patients. Further analysis of mild paediatric COVID-19 cases will have to determine whether this characterises all responses in children or is limited to severe disease. The lack of interferon signals in the airways may explain why ACE2 expression is not induced in paediatric COVID-19. In our data set we also see a strong neutrophil recruiting signature, driven by expression of calprotectin in different epithelial cell types, thus highlighting the key role of epithelial cells in initiating an innate immune response. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in (which was not certified by peer review) preprint The major distinguishing feature of the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in children in blood are striking increases in naive B and T cells as well as ILCs, with a loss of CD16 monocytes.",

Allele specific counts of RNA-seq reads at the SNP location in 1000Genomes Project data were generated for each airway sample. Because the read coverage from the scRNA-seq data was strongly enriched around the 5' end of a gene, SNP loci covered at least 20 reads for more than 90% of samples that were used (19,733 genome-wide SNP loci in total). The SNP genotype from allele specific expression was determined as a maximum posterior genotype after fitting a beta-binomial mixture distribution with underlying probabilities of 0.01, 0.5 and 0.99 for reference homozygote, heterozygote and alternative homozygote, respectively. The overdispersion parameter of the beta-binomial distribution was estimated for each sample independently shared across all SNPs. The genotype data from 1000Genomes samples were combined with the genotype data for our samples, and principal component analysis was performed on the scaled genotype data (mean 0 and standard deviation equal to 1 for each SNP locus). The ethnicity of each sample was determined by the Mahalanobis distance to the four major ethnic groups in the 1000 Genomes Project (African, East Asian, European and South Asian). The first three principal components were used to compute the cluster centre and the covariance matrix for each ethnic group.Cell type composition analysisThe number of cells for each sample and cell type combination was modelled with a generalised linear mixed model with a Poisson outcome. The five clinical factors (age, sex, ethnicity, tissue and COVID-19 status) and the six technical factors (donor, date of sample processing, 10X kit, technician, sequencing batch and sample) were fitted as random effects to overcome the colinearity among the factors. The effect of each clinical/technical factor on cell type composition was estimated by the interaction term with the cell type.

We fit the model on a geneby-gene basis using the estimated variance parameters to test each factor k explaining a significant amount of transcription variation. If the focal factor k is a categorical variable with L levels (e.g., COVID-19 status with 3 levels), we partitioned the levels into one of two groups. There are 2L-1 contrasts which were tested against the null model (removing the focal factor k in the model) to compute Bayes factors.
