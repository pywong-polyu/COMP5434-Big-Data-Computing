B 808 (2020) 135643]. In this viewpoint, black hole entropy no longer obeys the area law and instead it can be given by S \u223c A 1+\u03b4/2 , where the exponent \u03b4 ranges 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 1, and indicates the amount of the quantumgravitational deformation effects. Based on this, and using the deep connection between gravity and thermodynamics, we disclose the effects of the Barrow entropy on the cosmological equations. For this purpose, we start from the first law of thermodynamics, dE = T dS + W dV , on the apparent horizon of the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) Universe, and derive the corresponding modified Friedmann equations by assuming the entropy associated with the apparent horizon has the form of Barrow entropy. We also examine the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the Universe enclosed by the apparent horizon. Finally, we employ the emergence scenario of gravity and extract the modified Friedmann equation in the presence of Barrow entropy which coincide with one obtained from the first law of thermodynamics. When \u03b4 = 0, the results of standard cosmology are deduced.",

Inspired by the fractal illustrations of this virus, recently Barrow proposed a new structure for the horizon geometry of black holes [1] . Assuming a infinite diminishing hierarchy of touching spheres around the event horizon, he suggested that black hole horizon might have intricate geometry down to arbitrary small scales. This fractal structure for the horizon geometry, leads to finite volume and infinite (or finite) area. Based on this modification to the area of the horizon, the entropy of the black holes no longer obeys the area law and will be increased due to the possible quantum-gravitational effects of spacetime foam. The modified entropy of the black hole is given by [1] ",

            "text": "where A is the black hole horizon area and A 0 is the Planck area. The exponent \u03b4 ranges as 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 1 and stands for the amount of the quantum-gravitational deformation effects. When \u03b4 = 0, the area law is restored and A 0 \u2192 4G, while \u03b4 = 1 represents the most intricate and fractal structure of the horizon. Although the corrected entropy expression (1) resembles Tsallis entropy in non-extensive statistical thermodynamics [2] [3] [4] , however, the origin and motivation of the correction, as well as the physical principles are completely different. Some efforts have been done to disclose the influences of Barrow * asheykhi@shirazu.ac.ir entropy in the cosmological setups. A holographic dark energy model based on entropy (1) was formulated in [5] . It was argued that this scenario can describe the history of the Universe, with the sequence of matter and dark energy eras. Observational constraints on Barrow holographic dark energy were performed in [6] . A modified cosmological scenarios based on Barrow entropy was presented in [7] which modifies the cosmological field equations in such a way that contain new extra terms acting as the role of an effective dark-energy sector. The generalized second law of thermodynamics, when the entropy of the Universe is in the form of Barrow entropy, was investigated in [8] . Other cosmological consequences of the Barrow entropy can be followed in [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . The profound connection between gravitational field equations and laws of thermodynamics has now been well established (see e.g. [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] and references therein). It has been confirmed that gravity has a thermodynamical predisposition and the Einstein field equation of general relativity is just an equation of state for the spacetime. Considering the spacetime as a thermodynamic system, the laws of thermodynamics on the large scales, can be translated as the laws of gravity. According to \"gravitythermodynamics\" conjecture, one can rewrite the Friedmann equations in the form of the first law of themodynamics on the apparent horizon and vice versa [30] [31] [32] [33] . In line with studies to understand the nature of gravity, Padmanabhan [34] argued that the spacial expansion of our Universe can be understood as the consequence of emergence of space. Equating the difference between the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk and on the boundary with the volume change, he extracted the Friedmann equation describing the evolution of the Universe [34] . The idea of emergence spacetime was also extended to Gauss-Bonnet, Lovelock and braneworld scenarios [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] .",

            "text": "In the present work, we are going to construct the cosmological field equations of FRW universe with any spe-cial curvature, when the entropy associated with the apparent horizon is in the form of (1). Our work differs from [7] in that the author of [7] derived the modified Friedmann equations by applying the first law of thermodynamics, T dS = \u2212dE, to the apparent horizon of a FRW universe with the assumption that the entropy is given by (1) . Note that \u2212dE in [7] is just the energy flux crossing the apparent horizon, and the apparent horizon radius is kept fixed during an infinitesimal internal of time dt. However, in the present work, we assume the first law of thermodynamics on the apparent horizon in the form, dE = T dS + W dV , where dE is now the change in the energy inside the apparent horizon due to the volume change dV of the expanding Universe. This is consistent with the fact that in thermodynamics the work is done when the volume of the system is changed. Besides, in [7] , the author focuses on a flat FRW universe and modifies the total energy density in the Friedmann equations by considering the contribution of the Barrow entropy in the field equations, as a dark-energy component. Here, we consider the FRW Universe with any special curvature and modify the geometry (gravity) part (left hand side) of the cosmological field equations based on Barrow entropy. The approach we present here is more reasonable, since the entropy expression basically depends on the geometry (gravity). For example, the entropy expressions differ in Einstein, Gauss-Bonnet or f (R) gravities. Any modifications to the entropy should change the gravity (geometry) sector of the field equations and vice versa. We shall also employ the emergence idea of [34] to derive the modified cosmological equations based on Barrow entropy. Again, we assume the energy density (and hence the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk) is not affected by the Barrow entropy, while the horizon area (and hence the number of degrees of freedom on the boundary) get modified due to the change in the entropy expression. Throughout this paper we set \u03ba B = 1 = c = , for simplicity. This paper is outlined as follows. In the next section, we derive the modified Friedmann equations, based on Barrow entropy, by applying the first law of thermodynamics of the apparent horizon. In section III, we examine the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the universe filled with Barrow entropy. In section IV, we derive the modified Friedmann equations by applying the emergence scenario for the cosmic space. We finish with conclusions in the last section.",

In summary, in this section we derived the modified cosmological equations given by Eqs. (18) and (25) in Barrow cosmology. These equations describe the evolution of the universe with any spacial curvature, when the entropy associated with the apparent horizon get modified due to the quantum-gravitational effects. We leave the cosmological consequences of the obtained Friedmann equations for future studies, and in the remanning part of this paper, we focus on the generalized second law of thermodynamics as well as derivation of Friedmann equation (18) from emergence perspective.",

To do this, we consider the generalized second law of thermodynamics for the Universe enclosed by the apparent horizon. Our approach here differs from the one presented in [8] . Indeed the authors of [8] modified the total energy density in the Friedmann equations based on Barrow entropy. The cosmological field equations given in relations (3) and (4) of [8] are nothing but the standard Friedmann equations, in a flat universe, with additional energy component which acts as a dark energy sector [42] . However, as we mentioned in the introduction, here the effects of the Barrow entropy enter the gravity (geometry) part of the cosmological field equations. Thus, we assume the energy component of the Universe is not affected by the Barrow entropy. Besides we consider the FRW universe with any special curvature, while the authors of [8] only considered a flat universe. In the context of the accelerating Universe, the generalized second law of thermodynamics has been explored in [43] [44] [45] .",

He demonstrated that taking into account the quantum-gravitational effects, may lead to intricate, fractal features of the black hole horizon. This complex structure implies a finite volume for the black hole but with infinite/finite area for the horizon. In this viewpoint, the deformed entropy associated with the black hole horizon no longer obeys the area law and increases compared to the area law due to fractal structure of the horizon. The amount of increase in entropy depends on the amount of quantum-gravitational deformation of the horizon which is characterized by an exponent \u03b4.",

These corrections come due to the quantum-gravitational fractal intricate structure of the apparent horizon. To do this, and motivated by the \"gravity-thermodynamics\" conjecture, we proposed the first law of thermodynamics, dE = T h dS h + W dV , holds on the apparent horizon of FRW universe and the entropy associated with the apparent horizon is given by Barrow entropy (1). Starting from the first law of thermodynamics and taking the entropy in the form of Barrow entropy (1), we extracted modified Friedmann equations describing the evolution of the Universe. Then, we checked the validity of the generalized second law of thermodynamics by considering the time evolution of the matter entropy together with the Barrow entropy associated with the apparent horizon. We also employed the idea of emergence gravity suggested by Padmanabhan [34] and calculated the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk and on the boundary of universe. Subtracting N sur and N bulk and using the modification of Padmanabhan's proposal given in Eq. (44), we were able to extract Friedmann equations which is modified due to the presence of Barrow entropy. This result coincides with the one obtained from the first law of thermodynamics. Our study confirms the viability of the emergence gravity proposed in [34, 37] .",
