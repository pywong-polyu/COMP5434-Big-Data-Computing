            "text": "Context: Dedicated implementation efforts are critical to bridging the gaps between current practices and best practices. A quality improvement collaborative (QIC), the Spinal Cord Injury Implementation and Evaluation Quality Care Consortium (SCI IEQCC), was established to meet this need, bringing together a network of clinicians and administrators to systematically improve the quality and equity of tertiary spinal cord injury or disease (SCI/D) rehabilitation care in Ontario, Canada. Methods: Clinicians and leaders from five tertiary SCI/D rehabilitation centers and two not-for-profit SCI/D advocacy groups comprised a network dedicated to supporting implementation of the SCI-High quality indicators in prioritized domains of SCI rehabilitation and related best practices by: (1) building capacity through implementation science education of frontline clinicians; (2) providing resources and support to empower frontline clinicians to lead quality improvement efforts within their institutions; (3) promoting wider learning through a network for sharing ideas, efforts, and experiences; and (4) collecting indicator data to facilitate provincial evaluation of goal attainment. Results: Network members and sites collaborated to implement best practices within six priority domains; in 18 months, significant progress has been made in emotional wellbeing, sexual health, walking, and wheeled mobility despite disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. These efforts encompass heterogeneous challenges and strategies, ranging from developing clinical skills programs, to streamlining processes, to manipulating physical space. Conclusion: A QIC targeting SCI/D rehabilitation demonstrates promise for advancing the implementation of best practices, building implementation science capacity across multiple sites, and for promoting collaboration amongst SCI/D rehabilitation centers and organizational partners.",

            "text": "Spinal cord injury and disease (SCI/D) is a multisystem disorder that requires highly specialized interdisciplinary rehabilitation care. Prior studies show that in SCI/D, passive translation of best practices into routine care is slow and often incomplete. [4] [5] [6] Collaborative approaches to best practice implementation that involve networks of health care organizations may enhance service delivery and improve outcomes. 7, 8 Although there is considerable variability in the way quality improvement collaboratives (QICs) operate, they are typically characterized by organized cooperation of multiple healthcare sites working within a given healthcare condition; they focus on a shared approach to structured activities that promote collaboration and idea sharing, most often with a specific implementation or quality improvement framework with consistent data captured across organizations related to service performance and clinical outcomes. 7, 9 Despite substantial interest in these QICs and sustained establishment of QICs, there is limited, albeit encouraging, evidence to support using this approach to achieve quality improvement and best practice implementation. 7, 10 Prior experience from the Spinal Cord Injury Knowledge Mobilization Network (SCI KMN), which was active from 2011 to 2017 and consisted of 7 participating SCI/D rehabilitation sites across Canada, demonstrated that while a QIC can address quality gaps and build implementation science capacity in SCI/D rehabilitation, it did little to improve the speed of change, did not evaluate the sustainability of best practice implementation, and was vulnerable to funding discontinuation. [11] [12] [13] Consequently, an Ontario-specific QIC, the Spinal Cord Injury Implementation and Evaluation Quality Care Consortium (SCI IEQCChttps://SCIConsortium. ca) was established in January 2019 to expand on the SCI KMN's efforts to build networks and implementation science capacity and further implementation of best practices within SCI/D rehabilitation.",

Second, all site leads and IESs participated in intensive training related to implementation science methodology at a joint meeting in October 2019, as part of capacity building and collaborative network development. Critical components of this training included change leadership and management, drivers and root cause analysis, quality improvement and implementation tools, orientation to the SCI-High indicators, and data management training. This in-person training also fostered extramural relationships to build the strength of the SCI IEQCC QIC, which would be critical for sharing materials, challenges, learnings, and experience between sites. Third, IESs led the translation of this knowledge to their local teams to propagate implementation science ability to team members who did not attend the intensive in-person training and thereby build upon established local improvement culture. Fourth, frequent virtual IES meetings, which were supported by mentors with experience from the SCI KMN and SCI-High, facilitated sharing of progress, challenges, and successes between sites. Fifth, the steering committee and site leaders met monthly to support implementation plans and share site data with the central data repository.",

In addition to ensuring applicability of the indicators, IESs and teams were tasked with customizing their approach to implementation change within their setting. Although the SCI IEQCC and the quality indicators established priority domains and metrics for data collection, sites individualized the aims and change strategies as appropriate for their local improvement projects. The SCI IEQCC training program for IESs provided theoretical knowledge for understanding drivers and root causes, developing change ideas, and important concepts about the psychology of change.

To date, sites have made the most significant progress in emotional wellbeing, sexual health, walking, and wheeled mobility; the two patient safety domains, tissue integrity and UTI, have variable degrees of implementation across the network. Table 2 highlights examples of selected change ideas, Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, and processes that sites have used for each domain, and critical lessons derived from these experiences. Although capturing the entire breadth and depth of the implementation science efforts of the SCI IEQCC to date is beyond the scope of this manuscript, these selected examples illustrate the heterogeneity of the problems and contexts addressed within the domains and at each of the sites -navigating transformations from paper-based to electronic medical records, manipulating physical space to better meet best practices, developing systems of data collection, introducing new and augmenting existing clinical skills, achieving diagnostic consensus amongst diverse groups of clinicians, streamlining practices to reduce variability, and introducing peer mentorship and education programs. Sites' baseline performance varied widely: for some domains, improvements were limited to enhanced documentation to demonstrate that high standards are being achieved; for other domains, improvements required substantial changes to current practices including program development or modification and/or investment of resources. This variability across domains and sites necessitated fostering an individualized approach to quality improvement, allowing teams to begin or enhance their existing work within each domain in a context-congruent manner. This variability was also a key facilitator of expediting change: IESs could share Figure 2 Schematic representation of the evaluation and implementation process for each domain. Following domain prioritization (step one), steps two to six reflect the key implementation activities conducted for each domain within each site. Of note, specific tools linking to the Active Implementation Frameworks reflect practice profiling (step three), implementation driver analyses (step four), and Plan-Do-Study-Act improvement cycles (step six).

First, most sites selected IESs and local team members who contributed to these change initiatives while concurrently fulfilling their clinical role within SCI/D rehabilitation at their site. All sites described benefits of this approach: having experienced frontline clinicians serve as IES while embedded in clinical practice allowed them to better understand current practices and policies, communicate the rationale for practice improvements, carry out Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles, gather critical and timely feedback, and improve engagement amongst key stakeholders. Second, the key domains address problems that affect persons with SCI/D and multiple healthcare providers, so having diverse representation on each implementation team was critical to building consensus for what aims should be set, what best practices should look like, and how to move forward in a way acceptable to all key stakeholders. Third, IESs and their teams endorse intangible benefits to this collaborative work in improvement: for some, working together with colleagues at different institutions united for a common goal to improve the care we deliver has been very meaningful; for others, having implementation teams consisting of persons from multiple disciplines has augmented the collegiality of already collaborative clinical teams. That implementation science work can have these unquantifiable benefits locally and between sites, particularly in the context of the unprecedented stress and change the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, is notable.

The pandemic elevated the importance of this domain as sites adapted existing local programs and/or developed new methods to support the emotional well-being of patients during the pandemic and beyond. Some challenges, such as needing to limit in-person gatherings, were seemingly easily overcome by transitioning to virtual meeting platforms. IESs found the transition from in-person to virtual augmented the sharing of knowledge between and within participating sites; for instance, collaboration for the sexual health domain between sites significantly improved and expedited implementation of practice changes by having content experts from one site synchronously teach not only their own personnel but those at other sites. In contrast, the loss of in-person training was detrimental to other domains; for instance, adapting wheelchair skills training to virtual format ensured it could still take place, but was not as effective as in-person training for such a hands-on skill would be. Moreover, not all team members, particularly some persons with SCI/D living in the community, had access to sufficient equipment and/or technology literacy to participate virtually in a meaningful way. Like virtual care, virtual engagement in quality improvement efforts may remove barriers for some patients and exaggerate them for others. [26] [27] [28] Teams' approach to this problem varied, and regrettably, some teams found restoring the previous level of meaningful engagement was untenable. However, this highlighted the potential negative consequences of virtual care in expanding inequities for some patients, and galvanized teams and sites to consider this impact on service delivery.",

After declaring a state of emergency in Ontario due to the COVID-19 pandemic, inpatients admitted for SCI/D rehabilitation were struggling to obtain usual funding from the provincial government for assistive devices, which precluded timely discharges. Because the SCI IEQCC included leadership representatives from all the inpatient SCI/D rehabilitation centers and Spinal Cord Injury Ontario, we were able to leverage the voice of local leaders, the clinical expertise of the rehabilitation sites, and Spinal Cord Injury Ontario's strong government relations department to effectively advocate for the Ontario government to implement an emergency alternate process for automatic approval for inpatient assistive devices. The network was able to justify with lived experience and evidence why the government's assistive devices program needed to modify its services swiftly to ensure timely funding and access to essential mobility devices during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although this service disruption was outside the scope of the SCI IEQCC activities, the collaborative nature of the network leaders, the frontline work of its contributors, and the partnership with Spinal Cord Injury Ontario led to the rapid identification and resolution of this health system-level problem.",

            "text": "This QIC, and implementation science initiatives like it, serve the critical purpose of accelerating the translation of evidence-based best practices into everyday practices. However, the optimal methods for ensuring implementation remain unclear, and implementation initiatives are therefore critical learning experiences. Learning from efforts that came before it, such as the SCI NO. S1 S155 KMN, the SCI IEQCC has grown from key formative lessons: IESs were trained and supported by improvement experts because implementation science initiatives need mentorship; local teams are self-governing, diverse, and include persons with lived experience and frontline clinicians because representation of relevant perspectives drives engagement; and, change leaders need to be flexible and innovative because implementation challenges will vary across problems, institutions, time, and under external threat, as COVID-19 has shown. Despite the impact of a global pandemic, sites have made considerable strides towards their implementation targets across all domains. As implementation efforts within individual sites and domains progress, reporting on their outcomes will be critical to disseminating evidence of benefit of the QIC and its approach and/or for understanding the limitations of these efforts to better guide future endeavors and others who may lead them. As with many improvement initiatives, the future of the SCI IEQCC depends on ongoing availability of funding to support ground-level, frontline implementation science leadership and the related data collection and evaluation. Given that healthcare is increasingly resource constrained, care organizations may not be able to prioritize such initiatives without external funding. 10, 33 Existing evidence, albeit limited, suggests that QICs may be cost effective and produce cost savings. 10 As networks provide a platform for idea and resource sharing, QICs may augment the cost-effectiveness of implementation initiatives by reducing individual sites' development burden; for instance, SCI IEQCC sites with robust resources on sexual health shared their expertise as well as staff training and patient-level resources with other sites. 25 Nonetheless, most of the initial six key domains addressed by this QIC are unlikely to yield cost savings adequate to support self-sufficiency at this early stage of implementation. Robust implementation of best practices in additional domains, including patient safety domains and those prioritized for later implementation efforts, may offer opportunities for cost-savings that lead towards self-sufficiency, even though this was not a criterion for their selection. Although the delivery of best practices may offer other meaningful benefits to persons with SCI/D and the rehabilitation centers that serve them, future work of this QIC may require cost analysis evaluations to assess if QIC participation offers a relative financial advantage over intramural or extramural funding of individual sites.",

All five tertiary rehabilitation sites have made significant progress in emotional wellbeing, sexual health, walking, and wheeled mobility; immediate further efforts will focus on implementation of the two patient safety domains, tissue integrity and UTI. Key learnings from the first 18 months of the SCI IEQCC include: the importance of diverse team composition, including persons with lived experience and frontline clinician stakeholders, in advancing best practices as well as improving collegiality and meaning in the work; the utility of sharing experience and materials across sites to quickly and effectively drive implementation efforts; and, that there is a need for robust data collection infrastructure to capture implementation challenges and successes. Although data analysis has yet to occur in many of the priority domains to quantify demonstrable benefits, this QIC has demonstrated resilience and adapted to the unforeseen challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, successfully advocated for access to necessary funds for persons with SCI/D, and continues to work together to progress towards best practice implementation. The lessons and experiences from the earliest implementation efforts will be critical for long-term efforts on all domains.",
