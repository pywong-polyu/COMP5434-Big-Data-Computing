[4] [5] [6] Daridorexant (ACT-541468) blocks the actions of the orexin neuropeptides at both OX1 and OX2 receptors (i.e., it is a dual orexin receptor antagonist), which has thus shown to promote sleep and is currently being developed for the treatment of insomnia. 5, [7] [8] [9] [10] In the anticipated clinical dose range of 25-50 mg, in control individuals, daridorexant's pharmacokinetic (PK) profile is characterized by quick absorption, with time to maximum plasma concentration (T max ) of 1-2 h, a terminal half-life (t \u00bd ) of ~ 8 h, a clearance of 5.0 L/h, and volume of distribution at steady-state of 31 L. 8, 11, 12 The absolute bioavailability is 62%. The PK parameters of daridorexant following multiple-dose administration are similar to those observed following single-dose administration, whereby no relevant accumulation has been observed. 13 In a previous absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (ADME) study, 14 C-labeled daridorexant was shown to be extensively metabolized with only traces of parent drug excreted unchanged. 8, 14 Most of the administered radioactive dose was recovered in feces (50-69%), followed by urine (24-35%). Most observed metabolic reactions of daridorexant are mediated by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 oxidative transformations, whereas the three major metabolites of daridorexant, namely M1, M3, and M10, identified in human plasma have considerably lower affinity to OX1 and OX2 receptors than the parent drug and, thus, do not appear to contribute to a significant extent to the pharmacological effect. 8, 12, 14 For drugs that are predominantly eliminated via nonrenal routes and likely to be used in patients with impaired renal function, as is the case for daridorexant, health authorities recommend a reduced study design to assess the PKs in patients with renal impairment to provide appropriate dosing recommendations as, especially in severe renal function impairment (SRFI), can adversely affect other pathways of metabolism (i.e., may also affect the disposition of hepatically cleared drugs). 15, 16 Therefore, the intent of this conducted study was to represent a \"worst-case scenario\" whereby the greatest impact altered renal function might have on the PKs, safety, and tolerability of daridorexant was evaluated.",

Although the final individually matching control subject was not recruited, the study is, nonetheless, from a statistical view considered conclusive and valid, as the number of subjects enrolled in both groups was sufficient to ensure precise estimation of the relevant PK parameters of daridorexant. 16 PK results in control subjects in this study were within the range of variability observed in other studies, in which a single oral dose of 25 mg daridorexant was administered to a similarly aged population. 11, 12, 20 An apparent explanation for the outlier in group A could not be determined as nothing out of the ordinary in terms of demographic characteristics, medical history, and clinical laboratory variables was evident, whereas there was no concomitant intake of other drugs. The inherent variability of expression and function of CYP3A4, both intra-and interindividually, is considered a possible explanation. 21, 22 In patients with SRFI, C max and t \u00bd were virtually identical compared with control subjects, whereas median T max was 0.75 h in both groups. A slightly lower CL/F (by 13%) and V z /F (by 15%) in patients with SRFI was evident, and AUC 0-inf was increased 1.16-fold compared to control subjects. Based on the results of the ADME study, which showed excretion of daridorexant and its major metabolites mainly via the liver, it was not unexpected that the effects of renal impairment on exposure to daridorexant were limited. 8, 14 Renal impairment has been shown to impact the extent of plasma protein binding of a multitude of different drugs. 15, 23 In accordance with previous in vitro and clinical studies, daridorexant was confirmed to be highly bound to plasma proteins (>99%). Herein, no effect of SRFI on concentrations of unbound daridorexant could be determined.",
