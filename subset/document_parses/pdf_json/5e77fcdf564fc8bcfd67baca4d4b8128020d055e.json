The aim of this study was to demonstrate how surgical activity was affected by the virus outbreak and show the changes in practice in a tertiary referral COVID-19 center. The official bulletins of the Italian National Institute for the Infectious Diseases \"L. Spallanzani\" were reviewed to retrieve the number of daily COVID-19 patients. Records of consecutive oncological and transplant procedures performed during the outbreak were reviewed. Patients with a high probability of postoperative intensive care unit (ICU) admission were considered as high risk and defined by an ASA score \u2265 III and/or a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) \u2265 6 and/or a Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Preoperative Risk (RCRI) \u2265 3. 72 patients were operated, including 12 (16.6%) liver and kidney transplantations. Patients had few comorbidities (26.3%), low ASA score (1.9 \u00b1 0.5), CCI (3.7 \u00b1 1.3), and RCRI (1.2 \u00b1 0.6) and had overall a low risk of postoperative ICU admission. Few patients had liver cirrhosis (12.5%) or received preoperative systemic therapy (16.6%). 36 (50%) high-risk surgical procedures were performed, including major hepatectomies, pancreaticoduodenectomies, total gastrectomies, multivisceral resections, and transplantations. Despite this, only 15 patients (20.8%) were admitted to the ICU. Only oncologic cases and transplantations were performed during the COVID-19 outbreak. Careful selection of patients allowed to perform major cancer surgeries and transplantations without further stressing hospital resources, meanwhile minimizing collateral damage to patients.",

            "text": "Since December 2019, the world is struggling against Coronavirus Disease 2019 and in the past months, the life of more than one-third of the planet's population has radically changed [1] . Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has shown to be a very contagious virus potentially causing complicated atypical pneumonia and associated with significant mortality [2] . Despite initially confined to Hubei province, China and Asia, COVID-19 promptly spread to western countries, and in March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern [3] . By early April, we are counting over 1,500,000 cases and 88,000 deaths worldwide, with 209 countries involved over 4 continents [4] . Italy was one of the first western countries diagnosing COVID-19 patients in late January and was certainly the one suffering the most by the sudden outbreak of the disease. Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread throughout the country by the end of February, challenging the healthcare system toward its collapse, increasing the mortality rate and raising the question concerning the need for special measures to contain the crisis. As a matter of fact, by mid-March the Italian cases of COVID-19 were already 20,000 with almost 2000 patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit (ICU) [5] . Consequently, the Italian Government announced extraordinary measures to contain the spread of the pandemic, by means of small confinements in northern Italy, reaching a nationwide lockdown that is still limiting the population [6] .",

On February 4 (Day 4), due to the worsening clinical conditions, mechanical ventilation was needed, and the two patients were admitted to the ICU. Three days later (Day 7), a third patient with positive nasopharyngeal swab was admitted and monitored at the department of infectious diseases. From Day 4 to Day 30 (March 1, 2020), diagnostic nasopharyngeal swabs for symptomatic patients were implemented at our institution as part of a regional referral policy; however, no further patients tested positive to SARS-CoV-2, picturing a stable phase of the epidemic. On March 2 (Day 31), two individuals had a positive swab and were hospitalized; since then, an exponential growth of COVID-19 cases admitted to our hospital was registered as part of a national trend. Sixty-five hospitalized cases were reached on Day 34, nine of which required mechanical ventilation, therefore saturating the capacity of the ICU. On the evening of March 8, the Italian government announced the national lockdown, and the following day (Day 38), the first Institutional guidelines on extraordinary COVID-19 measures were released by our hospital (Fig. 1) : (1) All healthcare workers were required to enhance hygienic measures and wear surgical masks and gloves within the hospital building. (2) Construction works in the ICU started with the aim of increasing the number of beds from 9 to 25. (3) One of our daily general surgery operating rooms was closed to reallocate anesthesiologists and nurses to the management of COVID-19 cases. (4) The OR personnel was trained on how to wear and un-wear special equipment and how to deal with contagious patients. (5) Our surgical department was asked to re-consider and re-work the OR planning to perform only oncological cases and transplantations; outpatient clinics were significantly reduced. (6) Questionnaires on possible infection or contacts with COVID-19 cases were administered to all patients admitted and scheduled for surgery; nasopharyngeal swabs were performed in suspicious cases.

Our department suffered the sudden closure of one daily OR and the significant reduction in the possibility to use ICU beds after surgery, as these were day by day used for the management of COVID-19 patients. As surgeons, we had to completely re-consider our roles and our surgical activity, reckoning with the limited resources. We had to face a healthcare emergency with uncertain future course and adapt accordingly. Surgeries for benign conditions were stopped and the waiting list for cancer was handled and reworked entirely. The most important limitation was the hampered access to the ICU as many patients require intensive monitoring after surgery for cancer, especially when major procedures are needed. Furthermore, we had to deal with the fact that transplantations normally require intensive care management in the postoperative. We were advised to limit the number of surgeries requiring ICU admission as much as possible, to avoid the saturation of resources and failure of the system. As an institutional policy, our transplant center remained opened and we decided to continue with our standard surgical oncology activity, improving selection of patients to limit the need for postoperative intensive care management. Waiting list for liver and kidney transplantations was maintained respecting the same inclusion and exclusion criteria and using the same prioritization. Transplantations were still admitted to the ICU for monitoring through a dedicated pathway with dedicated personnel, despite limiting their length of stay and discharging them to the surgical ward as soon as possible. Notably, we have performed standard numbers of the high-risk surgical procedures, selecting more surgically fit individuals. Furthermore, patients were less commonly having preoperative neoadjuvant chemotherapy and/or previous surgery, significantly lowering intraoperative risks. All the transplantations performed were admitted to the ICU, while only three oncologic patients required intensive care management after surgery: these latter were patients with significant comorbidities that were scheduled for the high-risk surgeries (two pancreaticoduodenectomies for adenocarcinoma and one right hepatectomy for hepatocellular carcinoma). Our policy was pursued in an effort to prioritize patients by cancer prognosis. Indeed, malignancies requiring high-risk surgical interventions (i.e., cholangiocarcinoma, liver metastasis, pancreatic adenocarcinoma, and sarcoma) are generally those with the worst prognosis and more likely to suffer by a delay in treatment [23] . A different approach would have been to rework the waiting list for cancer prioritizing less-invasive procedures (i.e., colorectal resections) with no strict selection of candidates in order to cope with the limited resources [24] . The main issue here is that both strategies will generate a gap in cure that has to be considered in the near future when the COVID-19 crisis will be over. Surgical delay should not affect oncological prognosis, in order to minimize future repercussions of this international health crisis [23] . The alternatives to surgery and their efficacy should be reviewed and discussed for each type of cancer and case by case, in an effort to minimize the waiting list and the loss of patients due to cancer progression [25, 26] . In some cases, systemic treatment could be prolonged or adapted, while in others the window of cure might be missed; sometimes surgery can be postponed, while some other patients need surgical treatment to stay on their pathway [27, 28] . In this setting, multidisciplinary meetings should be reworked to consider patients with cancer in the COVID-19 era, in which resources and future are uncertain.",

Indeed, the significant reduction of outpatient clinics and the limitation in imaging modalities and/or endoscopies might hamper a rapid diagnosis and a prompt referral. As a further issue, it has already been shown that cancer patients are more susceptible to COVID-19 infections: 1% of COVID-19 patients in China had a history of cancer as compared to 0.29% among normal Chinese population [2] . These patients were also having more severe infections and most commonly required intubation and invasive ventilation. One lesson that we have learned in our hospital is that the diagnostic modalities for COVID-19 are important not only to contain the infection and avoid the spread of the disease but also to ensure safe treatment of patients. Questionnaires are useless in our opinion, as we are at the point that this pandemic cannot be detected by recalling contacts or possible exposure to the infection [31] . Indeed, once we have shifted to nasopharyngeal swabs for all patients admitted to our department, we had our first SARS-CoV-2-positive surgical candidate, this patient earlier tested negative to the questionnaire. On one hand, this highlights the importance of swabs for all surgical candidates to contain the infection among patients and healthcare workers; on the other hand, it sheds the light on the need for further evidence concerning the management of positive COVID-19 patients with cancer. Indeed, our patient with cholangiocarcinoma was shifted to non-surgical treatment: our team was unprepared at that time as no recommendations were available and issues regarding potential complications and transmission were raised. Recently, Lei et al. have demonstrated that 34 positive asymptomatic COVID-19 patients undergoing surgery had a 20% mortality rate, and all developed atypical pneumonias. Furthermore, it is very important to stress that our decision unfortunately altered the patient's prognosis, and this highlights the impact of this pandemic on our healthcare system. Finally, special considerations should also be made concerning COVID-19 transplanted patients [32] [33] [34] : indeed, immunosuppressive therapy might lead to an atypical clinical manifestation, such as unspecific viral disease or gastrointestinal symptoms [35] . This should be taken into account in order to minimize unexpected clinical complications and unpredictable outcomes.",

It has been speculated that laparoscopy might increase transmission due to the aerosolized biological fluids [36, 37] . In line with this, we are now using extra protection (double gloves, shield, and filter mask) and filtered gas evacuation systems to avoid any possible transmission during minimally invasive procedures. However, as possible aerosolized fluids happen also as a result of cauterization during open surgery, the surgical community needs more evidence and guidelines concerning the proper use of equipment and resources to be used during surgery [38] .",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first manuscript presenting numbers and statistical analysis highlighting the changes in surgical practice during COVID-19 outbreak. As we write, Italy is already in its fourth week of lockdown, and the emergency seems to have reached the peak. We will be probably moving toward more relaxed containment measures despite a total opening is unlikely. Meanwhile, countries worldwide are facing the ascending phase of this outbreak with a delay of days or even weeks. We believe it is important to share our anticipatory experience on how we have changed and adapted our surgical practice to face this crisis and optimized resources. Future evolution of this infection is uncertain: evidence, policies, and recommendations may change on daily bases hopefully improving the quality of care and minimizing the side effects on more patients. We must be prepared to face the consequent need for care in the coming months. By then, a progressive inverse trend should be encouraged, reallocating resources to assist those who suffered the most by the outbreak, both re-enforcing diagnostic steps, and treatment possibilities to counteract the delay we have so far accumulated.",
