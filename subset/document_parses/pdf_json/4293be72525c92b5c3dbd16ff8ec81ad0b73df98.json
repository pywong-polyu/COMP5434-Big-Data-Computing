This paper aims to analyse the impact on surgical block utilisation and efficiency in an orthopaedics reference centre in Northern Italy.

Number and type of procedures, first case delay, occupancy rate, and turnover time were used as indicators to benchmark the activities.",

            "text": "Results The overall number of surgical procedures decreased by 57%, from 537 in 2019 to 230 in the same timeframe in 2020. Orthopaedic procedures predominated in 2019, with 434 cases (80.8%), while in 2020, trauma was the leading activity, with 200 cases (86.9%). Orthopaedic surgery had a relative decrement of 93% while trauma has relatively increased by 94%. Mean first case delay in orthopaedic room (OR) was two hours and 36 minutes (SD 01:40:21) in 2020 compared with only 19 minutes (SD 00:02:15) in 2019. OR occupancy rate was 59% in 2020 compared with 89% in 2019. Turnover time raised from 21 minutes in 2019 to 53 min in 2020. Conclusions These data clearly show the deep impact of COVID-19 pandemic on OR facilities. Efficiency indicators fell dramatically in April 2020 compared with the corresponding period in 2019. This scenario will deeply affect both the waiting lists and the economic burden of the hospital. Regaining efficiency and maintaining the quality and safety of the process while restoring elective orthopaedic surgery are among the main challenges that surgeons will face in the next time.",

The regional hospital network had to change abruptly to comply with the high demand for hospitalisation and the sudden need for intensive care units. On March 2020, the regional government decided to restructure the hospital services by dramatically reducing orthopaedic room (OR) activities and increasing the availability of sub-intensive and intensive care units (ICU). A hub-spoke system was built up to centralise urgent cases needing specialised care as for cardiology, oncology, and even orthopaedic conditions, while SARS-CoV-2 spreading was reaching the climax.",

Health care providers are continuously striving to reach the highest possible level of efficiency in response to health care needs, and the utilisation of the ORs is a key factor in achieving this goal. Furthermore, OR process quality and safety is of paramount importance for a successful provision of hospital care [6, 7] . Based on the early data of SARS-CoV-2 spreading and the consequent health authorities' indications, all the non-urgent surgical procedures have been quickly stopped in our hospital. In the beginning, this strategy was applied to the majority of elective procedures, according to the regional guidelines. Then, at the climax of the outbreak, all the surgical procedures were cancelled but trauma, acute bone and joint infections, and aggressive or complicated malignant bone tumours. The collected data, here presented, refer to this period of complete lockdown.",

Trauma cases were mostly represented by femoral neck fractures mainly in elderly patients due to falls in the domestic environment. Few highly displaced humeral and wrist fractures in younger patients were also performed. This has been an effect related to the nation-wide lockdown period that has implied a consistent decline in road accidents, job-related accidents, and sports injuries. Noteworthy, a key target for femoral neck fractures in the elderly is to surgically proceed within 48 hours from admission, and this has influenced OR planning.",

However, the greatest delay was recorded for \"COVID\" ORs, with a mean delay of four hours and 23 minutes. The overall occupancy rate consistently decreased from 89% in 2019 to 59% in 2020 although not statistically significant (p = 0.066) because of the high standard deviation (i.e. high variability associated with the situation) However, the decrease in occupancy rate was significant when comparing \"COVID\" and \"non-COVID\" ORs (19.64% vs. 73.84%). Also, the turnover time dropped down from 53 to 21 minutes, although not significant (p = 0.213) due to the high level of variability (i.e. high standard deviation) mainly experienced in the \"COVID\" ORs. Several reasons can explain the recorded worsening of the performances: waiting for SARS-CoV-2 oral swab result, waiting for the completion of exams and visits path, safety procedures, surgical team turnover, reorganisation of the OR teams, planning difficulties. Furthermore, personal protective equipment (PPE) donning can be extremely time-consuming. OR management and planning have required optimisation of human resources already re-employed in COVID-19-related activities. Scrub nurses had to adapt to different surgical procedures, and anaesthesiologists were under pressure having to share time between ICU and ORs, while orthopaedic surgeons were underutilised or \"recycled\" in internal medicine activities in COVID wards.",

The cost of the safety protocols, that now have become mandatory, is also paid in terms of less OR efficiency lost. This complicated situation will increase the financial burden that has to be considered by health care authorities in terms of service refund. Elective surgery has paid, maybe the biggest cost, being completely stopped for more than two months, at the time of writing. When elective surgery will be, at least partially, reinstated, the loss of efficiency together with the expected number of daily procedures will inevitably increase the waiting lists [9, 10] . On the way of reinstating surgical activity, the main concerns are fragile patients that can be infected during hospitalisation. We have to start with patients without major comorbidities. On the other side, patients in need of surgery which can no longer be delayed, are often elderly with a mix of major comorbidities.",

A fundamental concern is about future pandemics and there is an important debate on the institution of dedicated COVID hospital. This study has several limitations. First, the analysis was performed only on one of the two surgery blocks of the hospital for major surgery. Nevertheless, it accounted for the one where trauma is usually performed, and its address was not changed during the pandemic period. Thereby, the comparisons are more reliable. Nevertheless, this paper aimed to exactly describe the impact that the epidemic has had, and is currently having, on the surgical services globally. Different surgical teams operated in the ORs, but again this is a common scenario in the hospital where different orthopaedic teams are active and anyway, they are the ones that usually work in this block. Also, the statistical analysis significance is somehow limited by the small number of cases and the great dispersion of data.",

Efficiency indicators have dramatically fallen during April 2020, and this is particularly evident in the comparison with the corresponding period of the previous year. As has been stated, the reorganisation of the activities as well as the probable need to cohabit with COVID-19 and, consequently, to maintain a certain level of attention, will deeply influence both the waiting lists, with important fallout on patients' management, and the economic burden. Regaining efficiency and maintaining process quality and safety while reinstating elective orthopaedic surgery will thus represent the next challenge for the orthopaedic surgeon, not only in Northern Italy but also in the whole national territory and, maybe, worldwide.",
