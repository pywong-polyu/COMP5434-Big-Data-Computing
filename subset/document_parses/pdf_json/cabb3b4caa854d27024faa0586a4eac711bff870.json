Specifically, they are less likely to be nonsmokers, physically active, and consuming adequate fruits and vegetables than those with the highest socioeconomic status [1] . Similarly, screening for cancers, for cardiovascular disease and for diabetes, all evidencebased actions with well-established evidence for decreasing morbidity and mortality, are lowest in Ontario in low-income neighbourhoods, particularly among residents without a regular primary care physician [2] . These disparities in the uptake of prevention and screening exist despite a universal health care system, where access to primary care services including cancer screening and preventive health checks are free to Ontario residents. Canadian and Ontario studies have found the incidence and prevalence of lung cancer, cervical cancer and diabetes is highest among residents of low-income neighbourhoods [3] [4] [5] .",

People living with low income may have challenges in accessing and attending appointments and may experience competing priorities at healthcare visits, making it more difficult for these individual activities to be adequately addressed [7] . The original BETTER (Building on Existing Tools To Improve Chronic Disease Prevention and Screening in Primary Care) intervention was designed to integrate the approach to, and thus optimize participation in, prevention and screening actions [6] . The BETTER intervention was targeted at primary care patients aged 40 to 65 years and involved assessing a person's risk factors and current participation in evidence-based prevention and screening actions, and using principles of motivational interviewing and brief action planning to support them to set their own goals. The intervention was administered by a \"prevention practitioner\" and consisted of a dedicated preventionfocused visit. The prevention practitioner was an existing non-physician health professional already situated within primary care practices (e.g. nurses, dieticians) and specifically trained to be a prevention practitioner. The BET-TER intervention was evaluated in a cluster-randomized trial, and found a 32.5% increase in the number of prevention and screening actions that were met by patients in the intervention group versus the control group [6] .",

We designed BETTER HEALTH to be delivered through local public health instead of primary care, and to engage people through community organizations and direct communication strategies. Thus, our objective was to test the effectiveness of the BETTER HEALTH intervention at improving participation in chronic disease prevention and screening actions for residents of low-income neighbourhoods six months after informed consent compared to residents of low-income neighbourhoods randomized to wait-list control.",

Staff from the local public health unit, Durham Region Health Department, were eager to be active partners and co-investigators in the study and agreed that public health nurses would be well suited for the role of prevention practitioner. As well, our identified neighborhoods aligned with neighborhoods that had already been designated as a priority by the public health unit.",

All sixteen were randomly allocated to one of the study arms before participants were recruited. Co-author RS randomly selected the neighborhoods using the \"sample()\" function contained in the statistical software package 'R' [11] . A random number generator in R was then used to randomly allocate neighborhoods to each arm: immediate BETTER HEALTH versus six-month waitlist, and the allocation was then shared with the rest of the study team.

Upon getting a sense of their overall health status from the prevention prescription, participants then chose the goals that were most important and feasible to address. During the process of goal-setting, the prevention practitioners helped participants identify barriers to goals and discussed ways to overcome these barriers, including those related to the SDOH. Prevention visits occurred in mutually convenient and safe locations, such as the offices of the public health unit, community centres, participants' homes, or other locations jointly agreed upon by the participant and the prevention practitioner. At the prevention visit, if the patient was eligible based on history and agreed, prevention practitioners measured height, weight, waist circumference and blood pressure using portable equipment. For the first four visits of the study, the two prevention practitioners reviewed together the baseline survey responses and the resulting prevention prescriptions for fidelity.",

We determined the crude rate ratio (without accounting for clustering) for the intervention group compared to the wait-list group. To obtain an estimated rate ratio that accounted for the clustered design, we then developed a mixed-Poisson regression model that included a cluster-specific random effects term to account for correlation arising from individuals within the same cluster. The natural logarithm of the denominator (number of eligible items at baseline) was incorporated into the model as an offset term. The dependent variable was the number of met items at follow-up, and the exposure was the study arm.

In the current study, participants were eligible for a mean of 8.6 of 19 (45.2%) evidence-based actions. This higher proportion of unmet actions at baseline is not surprising considering that our participants were living with significant socioeconomic disadvantage; many were unemployed, living with low household income and had relatively low education levels. As previously noted, people living with low socioeconomic status are less likely to be up to date on screening and more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors [1, 2, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Despite the socioeconomic disadvantage experienced by our study population, we found that the BETTER HEALTH intervention was effective in improving uptake of prevention and screening actions and that retention in the study was quite high (114/126, 90.5%), which likely reflects a high degree of participant support and engagement. The BETTER intervention has also been shown to be successful in both urban and rural primary care settings [6, 25] . Of note, when BETTER was implemented in rural primary care settings, people with lower income improved on the composite index to a greater degree than their counterparts in an adjusted analysis [25] . Taken together, these findings suggest that the BETTER intervention can be effective in a broad variety of settings and for a diverse array of participants who are motivated to make improvements in their health, including in both the primary care and public health contexts, and perhaps especially for those living with social disadvantage.",

Qualitative research as a part of BETTER HEALTH will explore which components of the intervention led to its success from both the participant and prevention practitioner perspectives and how to make BETTER HEALTH sustainable, and future research will adapt, and explore the effectiveness of, the BETTER intervention for adults under 40 years of age living with social disadvantage, for whom the potential to reduce premature morbidity and mortality is substantial [24, 30] . Importantly, this future research will explore the potential of the adapted intervention in both the primary care and public health contexts, as we recognize that public health resources can be quite limited, particularly considering recent demands created by the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "This study has several limitations. First, as noted, our research coordinator may have served as a co-intervention. However, this would bias our findings toward the null hypothesis, and the differences we observed might have been even larger if the survey had been self-administered. It is important to note that many participants had low literacy and a sustainable BETTER HEALTH intervention would likely require an interviewer-administered health survey. Second, we did not engage with the primary care providers of study participants and only one participant asked to be connected to the primary care provider arranged by the study team. Connection of the prevention practitioners with participants' primary care providers may have led to greater improvement in actions that required a provider's involvement, such as cancer screening and lipid and glucose testing, in the intervention arm. Third, we relied exclusively on self-report from study participants, which is subject to recall and social desirability bias (the tendency to under report socially undesirable actions and to over report socially desirable actions) [31] . However, we wanted to ensure that our intervention would be effective for those with no, or loose, primary care contact, and thus did not use medical record data. Fourth, we excluded non-English speakers, excluding a sociodemographic group that is likely at even higher risk of inadequate medical care. Fifth, we did not explore the role of other sociodemographic characteristics such as race/ethnicity and immigration status that may intersect with income. Sixth, we do not know if changes documented at six months, such as improvement in diet and physical activity, were sustained beyond that time period. Health-related behaviour change is notoriously hard to maintain in the long term [32] [33] [34] . Finally, we did not explicitly compare the clusters based on factors that may have affected uptake of recommendations, such as proximity to primary care or access to public transportation. However, we received input from public health on our clusters who felt that the included clusters were comparable.",
