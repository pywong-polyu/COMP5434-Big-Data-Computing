            "text": "The newly discovered COVID variant B.1.1.529 in Botswana has more than 30 mutations in spike and many other in non-spike proteins, far more than any other SARS-CoV-2 variant accepted as a variant of concern by the WHO and officially named Omicron, and has sparked concern among scientists and the general public. Our findings provide insights into structural modification caused by the mutations in the Omicrons receptor-binding domain and look into the effects on interaction with the hosts neutralising antibodies CR3022, B38, CB6, P2B-2F6, and REGN, as well as ACE2R using an in silico approach. We have employed secondary structure prediction, structural superimposition, protein disorderness, molecular docking, and MD simulation to investigate hostpathogen interactions, immune evasion, and transmissibility caused by mutations in the RBD region of the spike protein of the Omicron variant and compared it to the Delta variants (AY.1, AY.2, & AY.3) and wild type. Computational analysis revealed that the Omicron variant has a higher binding affinity for the human ACE2 receptor than the wild and Delta (AY.1 and AY.2 strains), but lower than the Delta AY.3 strain. MD simulation and docking analysis suggest that the omicron and Delta AY.3 were found to have relatively unstable and compact RBD structures and hampered interactions with antibodies more than wild and Delta (AY.1 and AY.2), which may lead to relatively more pathogenicity and antibody escape. In addition, we observed lower binding affinity of Omicron for human monoclonal antibodies (CR3022, B38, CB6, and P2B2F6) when compared to wild and Delta (AY.1 & AY.2). However, the binding affinity of Omicron RBD variants for CR3022, B38, and P2B2F6 antibodies is lower as compared to Delta AY.3, which might promote immune evasion and reinfection and needs further experimental investigation.",

            "text": "Viruses naturally have the ability to change their genetic makeup with time, which does not affect it drastically, but these changes may affect host range, disease severity, transmissibility, diagnosis, re-infection, the performance of vaccines and other therapeutics, etc. 1 The coronavirus spike (S) protein located throughout the virus surface is important for interaction with the host cell. The S protein (1273aa) is composed of signal peptide (amino acids 1-13), the S1 subunit (14-685aa), and the S2 subunit (686-1273aa). S1 and S2 mainly mediate host angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) receptor recognition and binding, followed by membrane fusion [4] [5] [6] [7] . To be precise, it is the RBD domain (319-541aa residues) located in the S1 subunit that binds to the host cell ACE2 receptor 6 . After binding with ACE2, a serine protease TMPRSS2 located on the host cell membrane is essentially required for S protein priming and helps viral spread. This TMPRSS2 (transmembrane protease, serine-2) proteolytically cleaves the peptide bond Arg685-Ser686 of the S1/S2 site and separates the two subunits. The S2 subunit, which remains within the viral envelop, ultimately attaches to the host membrane. The process of fusion and infection is further enhanced due to irreversible conformational changes of S protein by the second proteolysis at the S2' site (Arg815-Ser816). TMPRSS2 also cleaves ACE2 and promotes uptake of SARS-CoV and likely SARS-CoV-2 virions as well. In the secretory pathway of the infected host cell, SARS-CoV-2 S protein is preactivated by furin-mediated proteolysis, which requires a single bond cleavage for the fusion process activation and subsequent entry into the cell 8,9 . Mutations in the spike region may affect the way the virus interacts with the host or responds to antibodies. The D614G mutation in spike protein enabled higher ACE2 binding affinity and was correlated with higher transmission and increased viral loads in COVID-19 patients 7,10 . The Delta variant (B.1.617.2) of SARS-CoV-2 with higher infectivity was the leading factor in the third wave of the COVID-19 pandemic 11 . Multiple sub-lineages of Delta variants were observed to be circulated among populations. From data submitted in Nextstrain database, the PANGO lineage AY .1 contains T19R, T95I, G142D, E156-, F157-, R158G, W258L, K417N, L452R, T478K,   D614G, P681R, D950N and PANGO AY.2 contains T19R, G142D, E156-, F157-, R158G,   A222V, K417N, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, D950N and PANGO lineage AY.3 contains   T19R, E156-, F157-, R158G, L452R, T478K, Delta variant mutation Del157-158 in the NTD of the S protein is considered to be associated with antibody escape 12, 13 . The Delta variant has been shown to have a higher replication rate, transmissibility, viral load as well as immune evasion [14] [15] [16] ",

The binding score of ACE2R-Omicron RBD is higher (18208) than that of ACE2R-wild RBD, which is 17910, but it is less than ACE2R-Delta AY. 3 (19084) . The ACE2R-Delta AY.1 & 2 binding score 16886 is the lowest of all (Table   1) ",

According to WHO update on 28 November 2021, the current information about the transmissibility, disease severity, reinfection, effectiveness of existing vaccines, tests and treatment is not clear. Efforts are being made to better assess Omicron. In the present in silico study, we have analysed the effect of mutations on the structure and binding affinity of the RBD region of Omicron and Delta variants (AY.1, AY.2, & AY.3) with ACE2R and with five different monoclonal SARS-CoV-2 neutralising human antibodies, namely CR3022, B38, CB6, P2B-2F6, and REGN. The MD simulation done in this study provides insights into the structural variations. The docking analysis of the RBD region of Omicron and Delta variants (AY.1, AY.2, & AY.3) with the ACE2 receptor (ACE2R) and with selected antibodies showed differences in binding affinity when compared with the wild SARS-CoV-2 (original strain) spike-RBD region.",

The framework is then equilibrated at 300 K temperature and 1 atm for 100 ps using the canonical ensemble (NVT) (constant number of particles, volume, and temperature) and the canonical ensemble (NPT) outfit (constant number of particles, pressure, and temperature). We extended the MD run time to 100 ns (RBD Wild type, Delta Variants) and 20 ns (Omicron) after finishing the equilibrium measure.

Also, the analysis suggests changes in S protein physiological properties like polarity and hydrophobicity at multiple positions, as shown in figures 2 (C) and (D). The RBD variant protein was determined to be intrinsically disordered as compared to wild (Figure 3). Plaxco and Gross (2001) argue that protein disorder is critical to understanding protein function and folding mechanisms.

All these results suggest that mutations may have altered the structures and physiochemical properties of Omicron as compared to wild and the Delta variants.

We also kept track of each atom's RMSF variations to examine how the mutation changed the dynamic behaviour of the protein. Wild, Omicron, Delta (AY.1 & AY.2), and Delta AY.3 had average RMSF values of 0.16 nm, 0.17 nm, 0.15 nm, and 0.15 nm, respectively. In some regions, the RMSF value in AY.3 have intramolecular h-bonding of 171.28, 174.04, 177.71, and 178.23, respectively (Figure 5). 158.48 nm2, 154.52 nm2, 154.31 nm2, and 152.34 nm2 were the SASA values in Wild, Omicron, Delta (AY.1 & AY.3), and Delta AY.3 correspondingly (Figure 5).4. DiscussionGenetic lineages of SARS-CoV-2 have been arising and spreading around the world since the commencement of the COVID-19 pandemic. The S protein mediates the attachment of the virus to the host cell-surface receptor that making it a major target of neutralizing antibodies following SARS-CoV-2 infection39,40 . SARS-CoV-2 S Protein has a major role in host-pathogen interaction41 . As per the WHO report and its international networks of experts till now a numberof mutations in genomes of SARS-CoV-2 virions have been reported that are expected to be either neutral or moderately detrimental. Some mutations are expected to impact virus biology by affecting viral antigenicity, transmissibility, pathogenicity, and infectivity. Mutations in the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 are expected to alter the antigenic phenotype of SARS-CoV-2 and affect immune recognition too that requires immediate attention 42,43 . UK variant of B.1.1.7 lineage has 8 mutations in S protein that seems to be remaining susceptible for RNA-based COVID-19 vaccine BNT162b2 44 . South African variant of lineage B.1.351 having E484K mutations reported being incompliant for neutralizing antibody as well as convalescent plasma and sera from the vaccinated population 45 . A variant of B.1.1.28 lineage first identified in Brazil has 10 RBD mutations and one within the furin cleavage site. This variant was also found to have resistance for RBD targeted neutralizing antibody similar to B.1.351 46,47 . Lineage B.1.526 that contains E484K variation has been reported in New York first and found to have resistance for therapeutic monoclonal antibodies meanwhile low susceptibility for neutralization by vaccine sera or convalescent plasma 48 . In 2021 B.1.67 (L452R & E484Q) RBD variant was reported in India which brought a deadlier second wave in the country within a short time. In silico analysis of structural stability and molecular simulation data of double mutant predicted reduced binding affinity for CR3022 antibody as well as lower vaccine efficacy of double mutant with antibody in comparison to wild type 35 . The B.1.617.2 lineage named as delta variant has become a more transmissible and dominant strain and the structural changes due to mutation may have caused the reduced response to vaccines. A study has shown that the mutation in the Delta variant causes reduced binding with neutralizing antibodies and thereby escaping the immunity 49 . The newly emerged omicron variant has been found to have the highest number of variations among all earlier reported SARS-CoV-2 variants (32 RBD variations and 18 non-RBD variations) which invoke an evaluation of the potential of infectivity and contagious characteristics of this variant as well as vaccine and antibody efficacy. Here we performed computational analysis of the changed structure of spike glycoprotein of Omicron variant and also compared with most transmissible and dominant Delta variants (AY.1, AY.2, & AY.3) as well as wild SARS-CoV-2 (original strain) to investigate the discrepancy in susceptibility to the infection and potential for immune evasion. To estimate the binding efficiency of the variant's RBD region to ACE2R we carried out docking analysis of the RBD region to ACE2R. The binding score of ACE2R-Omicron RBD is 18208 while for ACE2R-wild RBD is 17910, ACE2R-Delta AY.3 is 19084 and ACE2R-Delta AY.1 & 2 are 16886 which shows that the omicron's RBD has higher binding affinity for ACE2R compared to wild SARS-CoV-2 original strain and Delta AY.1 & 2 whereas lower affinity compared to Delta AY.3 strain. The binding affinity of Delta AY.1 & 2 for ACE2R is least among all. Docking for evaluating binding efficiency of RBD region for five different humanmonoclonal antibodies viz. CR3022, B38, CB6, P2B-2F6, and REGN has also been done and found that the binding score of Omicron-RBD for antibodies CR3022, B38, CB6, P2B-2F6, and REGN is 8768, 13240, 13660, 11900, and 14696 respectively which is lesser than the binding score of wild-RBD as well as Delta AY.1 & 2 except for REGN. The binding score for Omicron-RBD for CR3022, B38, and P2B-2F6 is lesser than that of Delta AY.3 sub-lineage while for CB6 and REGN binding score is slightly higher for Omicron-RBD as compared to Delta AY.3 sublineage. Our docking analysis revealed lower interaction of Omicrons-RBD with human antibodies compared to wild strain of SARS-CoV-2 and deadly Delta variant and higher interaction with ACE2R compared to wild strain of SARS-CoV-2 and Delta AY.1 & 2 while lower in comparison to Delta AY.3. Next, we superimposed the 3D structure of the RBD region of SARS-CoV-2 wild strain with Omicron, Delta AY.1, AY.2 & AY.3 to predict alteration in structural and physiochemical parameters. This analysis shows intrinsically disordered Omicron-RBD protein along with a change in helix, strand, and the coil of Omicron structure as compared to the wild and Delta variant strains. Besides structural changes, polarity and hydrophobicity of Omicron were also found different from the wild type which indicates that the omicron variant is structurally and physiochemicaly different from wild stain however major alterations in whole RBD structure were found in Delta variants AY.3 in contrast to Delta AY.1 & AY.2 and Omicron. MD simulation was done to analyze the impact of mutations on protein structure. MD simulations provide insights into protein's behavior in its natural environment and compute its trajectory over time, providing information on changed protein structure and fluctuations that may help to analyze flexibility and stability 50 . Pathological phenotypes can be caused by changes in protein stability and flexibility 51 . We evaluate the transient characteristics of wild-type and mutant Spike RBD to understand the functional and structural differences between the two. High fluctuations of RMSD were observed in Omicron and Delta AY.3 variants as compared with wild type while lower in Delta AY.1 & AY.2. The RMSD analysis showed lower average RMSD value of wild type in order [wild type < Delta (AY.1 & AY.2) < Omicron < Delta AY.3] suggesting wild RBD was more stabilized and Delta AY.3 and Omicron showed unstable structure. A higher RMSF value was observed in Omicron that shows a more flexible structure than other variants which showed limited movement in the structure. In comparison to wild, the lowest Rg value found in Delta (AY.1 &AY.2) followed by Delta AY.3 and Omicron that intimates more compactness in protein structure. Intramolecular H bonds showed higher fluctuations in all mutant variants compared with wild type; albeit they overlapped at times and were higher and lower than wild type at other periods in the case of Delta (AY.1 & AY.2), Delta AY.3, and Omicron (Figure 5). Intramolecular H bonding showed that the wild type had a lower average number of hydrogen bonds than Omicron, Delta (AY.1 & AY.2), and Delta AY.3 sequentially. The stiffness of proteins and their interactions may be affected by fluctuations in total intramolecular H bonds 52 . The highest SASA value was observed in the wild type than the variants in decreasing order: wild > Omicron >Delta (AY.1 & AY.3) > Delta AY.3 which indicate that the examined variants are less accessible than the wild-type protein, which might affect their capacity to interact with other molecules.",
