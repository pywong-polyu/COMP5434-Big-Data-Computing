In terms of the content of tweets, we argue that there is a chasm between the biomedical and biopsychosocial elements of ACP, including patient narratives. If used properly, Twitter conversations and National Health Care Decision Day hashtags could be harnessed to serve as a connecting point among organizations, physicians, patients, and family members to lay the groundwork for the trajectory toward a good death.

In particular, Twitter has been studied as a tool for communicating about cancer [20] , human papillomavirus vaccines [23] , and Alzheimer disease [24] . Recent work has indicated that Twitter can be a useful tool for health care participants to communicate about ACP, suggesting that \"Twitter is a new avenue for patients, clinicians, and advocates to engage with each other to better understand each other's perspectives related to ACP\" [25] . Key to the diffusion of information and the creation of communities on Twitter is the use of hashtags, which could serve to unify discourse and induce a sense of support and belonging [26, 27] . Coupling this with recent calls to reconsider approaches to ACP [9, [28] [29] [30] , we extend this work as this study situates Twitter as a social media tool and relevant NHDD hashtags as a mechanism to engage in conversations related to ACP.",

            "text": "Although possibly appearing contradictory in nature, the concept of a good death carries a great deal of significance for patients, loved ones, and health care participants alike [17, 31] . Although each person's perception may differ on how a good or successful death would be defined by them personally, there are commonalities with what this experience entails. Such experiences are constructed of elements related to physiological, social, existential, and spiritual components [32] , which are then reflected in specific actions such as pain management, being in the presence of loved ones, and respecting the patient's values and wishes [33, 34] . However, a good death manifests itself differently for each person, considering their history, cultural background, attitudes, health conditions, and personal views and attitudes toward death [35] . Although much work has been dedicated to establishing a more positive death experience, the ability to die well continues to be inhibited by several challenges, including poor communication, physical and systemic barriers, lack of knowledge related to the disease trajectory, and discontinuity of care [17] . A recent commission put forth a report to help refocus on and find value in death. Five principles were offered to help re-envision death and dying, including \"the social determinants of death, dying, and grieving are tackled; dying is understood to be a relational and spiritual process rather than simply a physiological event; networks of care lead support for people dying, caring, and grieving; conversations and stories about everyday death, dying, and grief become common; and death is recognized as having value.\" [5] In an attempt to make sense of the dying process and find value amidst death, we present the Opportunity Model for Presence During the EOL Process (OMP-EOLP) and argue that for a quality dying experience to take place, health care participants must be included at every step of a health care journey [17] . Opportunities for presence include integrating such conversations into the sociocultural context of individuals, which helps normalize and reduce the stigma of engaging in EOL conversations. Specifically, the biopsychosocial and spiritual elements of health care participants and their values and culture, including media exposure and language, make up the sociocultural context. As the conversation starts in a sociocultural context, it continues when either a terminal diagnosis is made or returns to a conversation regarding ACP throughout the normal aging process. Additional opportunities for presence during the EOL process include the place of care, knowledge about family members' health status, and the moment of death. With high engagement at each step of the way and by having a presence check, the opportunity to die well is improved. We argue that from a public health perspective, ACP conversations using Twitter can influence engagement throughout the EOL process.",

First founded in 2008, the NHDD was created with the goal of providing clear, concise, and consistent information related to health care decision-making [36] . Since then, the initiative's goal has been to target the general public, health care providers, and facilities to provide free, simple, and uniform tools to guide this process [37] . Now managed by The Conversation Project, started by Ellen Goodman in 2010, NHDD is described as a public engagement initiative [18] , which was started by Goodman when she and a group of colleagues started sharing personal stories related to good deaths or hard deaths they had witnessed. The NHDD serves to encourage patients to express their wishes regarding their health care. In turn, this effort also exhorts providers and facilities alike to respect such wishes, regardless of what is expressed or asked for. Although efforts related to NHDD comprise community interventions, interpersonal interactions, and in-person events, such efforts have also been conducted on the web. This includes the integration of web-based toolkits featuring ACP resources, as well as engaging viewers on social media platforms such as Twitter [25] .",

From #BlackLivesMatter [26, 27] to #OccupyWallStreet and #MeToo [38] , hashtags have been used in recent years as an efficient way of solidifying networked activism and diffusing discourse around social issues. Beyond connecting social media users using similar linguistic symbols, hashtags are also useful for broadening discursive communities, for example, by attracting the attention of journalists and other elites [39] . Hashtags have been used to promote public health interventions, causes, and events and facilitate 2-way communication between public health officials and the public on multiple occasions, such as #LiveFitNOLA [40] and #GetUsPPE [41] . In fact, so potent is the use of hashtags for health campaigns and discussions that in the realm of vaccines, they were used both by those promoting science, such as the provaccine #DoctorsSpeakUp [42] , and malicious actors who hoped to sow discord among Americans, such as the Russian Internet Research Agency's use of the antivaccine hashtag #VaccinateUS [43] . Most recently, Cutshall et al [25] focused on ACP and brain tumor stakeholders with #BTSM (brain tumor social media), connecting such hashtag engagement and related activism efforts and extending it to advance efforts toward EOL care, specifically ACP.",

Specifically, it looks at how EOL, ACP, and NHDD are discussed among Twitter users and what conversations might be able to tell us in terms of individuals' attitudes and potential behavioral intentions regarding ACP. In light of this, we pose the following research questions (RQs): With this, we analyzed tweets published over a full year, between August 1, 2020, and July 30, 2021 (N=9713), to understand how social media had been used as a tool for promoting a day dedicated to making health care decisions, which we call discussions of ACP. For the purposes of this study, we use the term ACP to broadly encompass the whole process of engaging in conversations about EOL goals of care, regardless of whether an AD is completed.",

To identify discourse around the NHDD that did not use hashtags, we also collected tweets using the exact terms national healthcare decision day, advance care plan, goals of care, and goals-of-care. Using these keywords, we collected all available tweets published between August 1, 2020, and July 30, 2021 (N=9713) on Twitter using the company's academic application programming interface (7410/9713, 76.27% after removal of duplicates).",

The ANTMN method suggests a four-step process: topic modeling, topic networking, community detection, and qualitative analysis, as shown in Figure 1 . Topic modeling (in this case, using latent Dirichlet allocation) is an unsupervised machine learning method that identifies themes in large textual data [45] . The modeling's unsupervised, inductive nature makes it especially useful for work with corpora in which the set of possible topics and themes is not known a priori [46] . Topics are distribution lists of word probabilities based on their co-occurrences in the same documents (in our case, Twitter posts and tweets). Importantly, although the modeling stages were performed inductively and with no reliance on prior theory, after automated modeling, researchers interpreted the results by qualitatively studying the most common words related to each topic and the most representative documents for each topic. Harnessing the breadth of the data, we also looked at dynamic changes in prevalence topics and themes over time.",

Having one or more conversations about EOL wishes does not guarantee a smooth or high-quality EOL process. This is critical when applied to the OMP-EOLP, and public dialog is related to EOL taking place [3, 14, 16] , in this case, via Twitter. The opportunity for presence is achieved through social media engagement. However, this is only 1 factor in the OMP-EOLP, and the continued high level of engagement of health care participants needs to follow the EOL trajectory. Although we cannot evaluate the success of this in this study, we argue for both academics and clinicians that an understanding of conversation at a public health level is necessary so that future efforts can be tailored more effectively to meet the needs of health care participants.

By avoiding the use of clear terms surrounding death and dying, although well-intentioned, the lack of clarity can perpetuate confusion among health care providers and the public alike. On the basis of qualitative analysis, goals of care were intertwined with ACP, and a point of discussion and disagreement is whether goals of care equate to ACP. Other similar tweets shed light on how various social issues, such as racism and prior negative health care experiences, also fuel this mistrust, which leads to greater barriers that get in the way of the ACP process. The connection with the OMP-EOLP is that the sociocultural factors of health care participants are at play in ACP conversations on Twitter. It is critical for health care providers to be aware of this mistrust in underrepresented communities. For example, the well-documented mistrust of the health care system in the African-American community stems from unethical research practices such as the Tuskegee Syphilis study [53] . Support for this connection is illustrated in the Social Determinants of Health framework, wherein there are factors at play that are not biomedical but instead, a result of where we live, work, and age that influences our health [5, [54] [55] [56] .",

Knowing who is involved in such conversations is important as it allows us to better target resources for pre-existing conversations related to EOL wishes and planning.

However, we cannot definitively make assumptions about each user's profession based on the corpus. That said, based on the content in conversations and seeing as it was medically based and filled with technical jargon, we can determine involvement as some form of health care provider or practitioner. In addition, individual users sometimes referenced their own experiences on the job either in hospitals or medical settings, such as medical students or acting physicians. The involvement of such professions in these conversations would make sense, given that Twitter is a social media platform that is used for engaging in public, large-scale, health-related, and oftentimes stigmatized conversations (Tenzek et al, unpublished data, 2022) [19, 61] . In practice, this can be helpful for health professionals who need to locate continuing education credits or are interested in attending workshops related to ACP. Furthermore, the social work profession had a large presence in the analysis. Scholars have argued that any health professional could initiate a conversation related to ACP, which is critical in light of COVID-19 [63] . Research suggests that any one of the team members may be the one to engage in a conversation related to ACP with patients, and recently, chaplains have been identified as key professionals in helping with ACP, moving ACP conversations upstream [3, 5, 57] . We argue that being aware of the opportunities for engagement at different times in the health care experience becomes important for a quality EOL, and collaboratively communicating within the team becomes even more critical to providing quality care [17] .",

Recent work suggests that language choice, including specific words and simplicity, is critical to how people receive messages related to ACP [64, 65] . The results of this study point to the presence of information about this incredibly difficult, complex, and stigmatized topic, which is shared in \u2264280 characters. We see in the current results is that it is mostly professionals and clinical terminology about the EOL process from health care providers' perspectives, generally independent from overarching health care facilities or organizations. The professionals who had the right jargon could follow and contribute to the conversation; however, those without the medical dictionary and appropriate hashtag legend to make sense of all the information in tweets may not receive the messages or bypass them if they cannot understand. This means that individual physicians and health care workers are taking this initiative upon themselves to share with and educate others; however, this may be problematic. This study contributes to previous research that argues that engaging in public dialog about ACP must meet the public's perceptions and beliefs about ACP and not of those who already believe ACP is important and have taken action [7] . Furthermore, upon observation, the NHDD hashtag does not directly communicate to audiences that it is an effort to help people plan for death. We should question whether the language choice was intentional in an effort to help audiences be more receptive to a goal-related conversation about health care decisions in general or if the avoidance further reinforces the taboo nature wherein US culture and societies silence this difficult conversation (Tenzek et al, unpublished data, 2022) . On a global scale, we see efforts in England called Dying Matters and Good Grief and Good Death in Scotland, where there is no question about what will be discussed. We argue that in the sociocultural context, using language as an opportunity for engagement is critical, and further studies should examine people's perceptions of willingness to talk about dying based on the hashtag being used.",

Our analysis revealed unique ACP considerations, including patients with Alzheimer disease and prison populations, which are complex and stigmatized issues in health care. Using the Social Determinants of Health framework [5, [54] [55] [56] in connection with the OMP-EOLP, we suggest a shift in ACP conversation to focus more broadly on the issues of literacy, access, and trust in health care as a resource for individuals. A recent study found that although 80% to 90% of people may be aware of ACP and believe that it is important, less than half (10%-41%) actually named a proxy or filled out a form [7] . It appears that education and awareness may not be the biggest barriers to ACP; people are aware that it exists, but there may be little action toward identifying specific wishes for care along the EOL continuum from diagnosis through death [17] . Morrison et al [30] argued that unless the health care system supports goal-centered care and provides resources to follow through with physician-patient conversations and consequential delivery of care, ACP outcomes will fall short of the intended goal; that is, providing the care at EOL that the patient wants. We see this conversation taking place on a global scale, as internationally, there are efforts to bring value back into the EOL [5] .",

In doing so, part of the health care experience is ACP throughout a lifetime, not only at EOL, thus shifting ACP conversations upstream [3, 66] . This is incredibly important for clinicians and scholars to be aware of as we strive to re-envision ACP so that people are more comfortable engaging in ACP conversations. In terms of the content of tweets, we argue that there is a chasm between the biomedical and biopsychosocial elements of ACP, including patient narratives. Aligning with Cutshall et al [25] , if used properly, Twitter conversations and certain hashtags can be harnessed to serve as a connecting point among organizations, physicians, patients, and family members. It is a difficult but worthy effort to lay the groundwork for the trajectory toward a good death.",

We were not able to compare hashtag use in a pandemic, nor were we able to definitively determine the authors of the tweets. On the basis of our findings and a recent report of the Lancet Commission to reimagine death, the pandemic may have further stigmatized, instilled fear, or created hesitancy toward engaging in EOL conversations [5] . Future work should explore prior conversations to reveal trends or changes in conversations over time and delve further into the implications that COVID-19 has had on how we discuss dying.

The key is figuring out how to continue to promote and inform the public in the United States about NHDD and, subsequently, about ACP. As the use of social media continues to be part of our daily lives, we argue that Twitter can also be used to promote EOL processes. Third, although Twitter is becoming more popular as a way of engaging in discussions encompassing diverse perspectives without geographical boundaries, current trends in social media use indicate that other social media platforms such as Facebook and Instagram have more users. In addition, with the rise of TikTok during the COVID-19 pandemic [67] , researchers should consider moving toward building a bridge that connects social media messages related to ACP across platforms and users alike.

Although several prominent conversations did occur across Twitter, the present analysis shows that there is still work to be done regarding the successful integration of ACP into common everyday practice and conversation. This study allows us to see what is present and subsequently lacking in ACP conversations. In turn, the findings can aid in structuring interventions to help better promote NHDD and help practitioners and patients alike reap the benefits of ACP. Ultimately, the findings can provide more opportunities for conversations about ACP and hopefully encourage open communication about EOL decision-making and planning as a foundation for future presence through the EOL process.",
