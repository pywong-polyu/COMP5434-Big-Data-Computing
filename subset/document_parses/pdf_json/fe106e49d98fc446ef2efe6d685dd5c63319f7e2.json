            "text": "Objectives. We aimed to gain an understanding of the paradox of the immunity in COVID-19 patients with T cells showing both functional defects and hyperactivation and enhanced proliferation. Methods. A total of 280 hospitalised patients with COVID-19 were evaluated for cytokine profiles and clinical features including viral shedding. A mouse model of acute infection by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) was applied to dissect the relationship between immunological, virological and pathological features. The results from the mouse model were validated by published data set of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) of immune cells in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients. Results. The levels of soluble CD25 (sCD25), IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and TNF-a were higher in severe COVID-19 patients than nonsevere cases, but only sCD25 was identified as an independent risk factor for disease severity by multivariable binary logistic regression analysis and showed a positive association with the duration of viral shedding. In agreement with the clinical observation, LCMV-infected mice with high levels of sCD25 demonstrated insufficient anti-viral response and delayed viral \u00aa clearance. The elevation of sCD25 in mice was mainly contributed by the expansion of CD25 + CD8 + T cells that also expressed the highest level of PD-1 with pro-inflammatory potential. The counterpart human CD25 + PD-1 + T cells were expanded in BALF of COVID-19 patients with severe disease compared to those with modest disease. Conclusion. These results suggest that high levels of sCD25 in COVID-19 patients probably result from insufficient anti-viral immunity and indicate an expansion of pro-inflammatory T cells that contribute to disease severity.",

            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by SARS-CoV-2, is characterised by pneumonia and hyper-inflammatory immune response with a cytokine storm. Most patients present with mild to moderate illness followed by recovery but a substantial number of patients develop severe disease characterised by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and lead to elevated mortality. 1, 2 Like infections of other highly pathogenic human coronaviruses, disease severity in COVID-19 increases during virus clearance, suggesting that the severe illness is mainly caused by the host immune response. 3 Clinical studies have reported various dysregulation of the immune system in COVID-19, but the underlying immune mechanism for severe illness remains to be elucidated. 4 The mixed phenotype of T cells represents a major paradox of immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. 4, 5 Lymphopenia is a common feature of patients with severe COVID-19, and several studies reported reduced cytotoxicity and polyfunctionality of T cells with upregulated expression of exhaustion markers in patients with severe disease [6] [7] [8] [9] while other studies revealed the association of enhanced activation and proliferation of T cells with severe illness. 10, 11 In this study, we assembled 280 hospitalised patients admitted with COVID-19 and found that soluble CD25 (sCD25), unique among a panel of cytokine markers, was selectively associated with disease severity, organ injuries and prolonged viral shedding. Using a mouse model of acute viral infection, we discovered that the elevation of sCD25 was caused by the insufficient anti-viral T-cell immune response and the resulting expansion of CD25 + PD-1 + CD8 + T cells, which participated in pro-inflammatory response drove disease severity. Enhanced expansion of CD25 + PD-1 + T cells was also recorded in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) of COVID-19 patients with severe disease compared to moderate disease. These results suggest that a divergence between anti-viral and pro-inflammatory T-cell responses drives COVID-19 severity.",

            "text": "Soluble CD25 is associated with severe illness in patients with COVID- 19 We conducted a retrospective study of proinflammatory cytokine profiles in 280 hospitalised patients admitted with COVID-19 at Tongji Hospital, Huazhong University of Science and Technology in Wuhan from 27 January to 5 February 2020. 12 According to 2019 clinical practice guideline from IDSA and ATS for diagnosis and treatment of adults with community-acquired pneumonia, 13 they were categorised into severe (139/280, 49.6%) and nonsevere (141/280, 50.4%) groups within 15 days after admission. Epidemiological, demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with COVID-19 are shown in Table 1 and 2. Similar to other reports, 1,2,4,14 we found serum levels of sCD25, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) were higher in severe cases than in non-severe cases (P < 0.01), whereas the levels of IL-1b showed no difference between two groups (P = 0.228) (Figure 1a and Table 2 ). We took the advantage of this reasonably sized cohort and conducted univariable binary logistic regression analysis. Older age, hypertension, diabetes, elevated levels of sCD25, IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-a were all positively associated with severe illness (P < 0.05) ( Table 3) . However, multivariable binary logistic regression analysis including these seven variables only identified age and sCD25 as independent risk factors for disease severity (Table 3) . Since sCD25 was measured at hospital admission, we next examined the predictive value of sCD25 for disease severity, which was evaluated by the highest activity during the disease course. The levels of sCD25 negatively correlated with lymphocyte counts (lymphopenia, 51.8% in severe vs 32.6% in non-severe, P = 0.001) and positively correlated with the levels of high-sensitive Creactive protein (hsCRP, 92.8% in severe vs 72.3% in non-severe, P < 0.001) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH, 80.3% in severe vs 53.2% in non-severe, P < 0.001) (Figure 1c-e and Table 2 ). As markers for systemic inflammation and organ injury, lymphopenia and increased hsCRP and LDH are common clinical features of severe COVID-19. 12, 15 In line with strong correlations between sCD25 and these indicators, COVID-19 patients with higher than normal sCD25 with upper limit (reference value, 710 U mL \u00c01 ) showed higher incidences of multiple organ damages including ARDS (28.8% in sCD25-normal vs 41.2% in sCD25high, P = 0.030), liver injury (9.8% in sCD25normal vs 24.3% in sCD25-high, P = 0.001) and kidney injury (9.1% in sCD25-normal vs 24.3% in sCD25-high, P < 0.001) (Figure 1f  and  Supplementary table 2) .",

Duration of viral shedding was calculated as the period from the illness onset to the date of the first negative result of nucleic acid tests. Notably, among tested pro-inflammatory cytokine markers, sCD25 was the only marker that showed a positive association with duration of viral shedding (Figure 2b ), suggesting prolonged viral persistence and/or defective anti-viral immunity in patients with high levels of sCD25. Together, these data from COVID-19 patients suggest that, among elevated cytokine markers, sCD25 is associated with disease severity and a potential inefficiency in viral clearance.",

Contrasting with high concentrations of sCD25 in COVID-19, sFasL and sCD62L were reported being decreased, 18 indicating there was no ubiquitous enhancement of proteolytic cleavage activity.

Viral dose and host genetic background determine the kinetics and magnitude of host immune response and result in different pathogenic outcomes from mild symptom to severe illness including mortality. [20] [21] [22] [23] Therefore, LCMV infection can be used to model certain features of host immunity and To analyse the overall function of T cells in LCMVinfected mice, we applied principal component analysis (PCA) of 21 variables for T-cell activation, differentiation and function gained by flow cytometry (Supplementary table 3 ). The total of 14 mice with LCMV infection were segregated into two clusters ( Figure 3e ) with a significantly higher sCD25 in Group 2 (red, n = 5) than in Group 1 (green, n = 9) (Figure 3f ). To understand the relationship between sCD25 levels, T-cell function, viral clearance and disease severity, we projected sCD25, viral titres and weight change to the PCA space generated by T-cell functional variables and found these total 24 variables forming three major modules by hierarchical clustering (Figure 3g ). Compared to Group 2 with higher sCD25, Group 1 with lower sCD25 was featured in the first module, composed of variables indicating strong activation of T cells (high T/B ratio and high activation marker CD44) and, furthermore, the generation of viralspecific short-lived effector CD8 + T cells (KLRG1 and LCMV-specific gp33 tetramer) (Figure 3g and h). The effective anti-viral immunity, indicated by higher frequencies of gp33-tetramer + CD8 + T cells, was associated with viral clearance (Figure 3h ). In contrast, mice in Group 2 with higher sCD25 were featured by the second module consisting of a disparity of CD4 + and CD8 + T cells (Figure 3i ), which agreed with the negative relationship between sCD25 concentrations and the frequencies of CD8 + but not CD4 + T cells reported in COVID-19 patients. 24 Mice in Group 2 also showed enhanced IL-2/CD25 expression in both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and higher viral loads (Figure 3g and i). The expression of CD25 is upregulated in T cells in response to antigen and IL-2. 24 Based on our results, high levels of sCD25 and increased expression of CD25 on CD8 + T cells in viral infection were likely to be caused by insufficient anti-viral immunity, which resulted in sustained antigen stimulation and enhanced IL-2 signalling. This notion supports the observation in COVID-19 patients that high sCD25 positively correlated with prolonged duration of viral shedding (Figure 2b ).",

PCA and hierarchical clustering analysis revealed that PD-1 as a variable was part of the third module which composed of variables associated with the expression of proinflammatory cytokines and effector molecules in T cells and also weight change in infected mice (Figure 3g ). At day 8 post-infection, weight changes in mice ranged from 10% loss to 5% gain To test whether CD8 T cells indeed drove disease severity, we infected mice with the genetic ablation of CD8 + T cells (CD8-KO). The lack of CD8 + T cells reduced sCD25 levels ( Figure 4c ) and protected mice from weight loss and organ damages caused by acute viral infection (Figure 4d and e) .

In contrast to IL-2Rb (CD122) was expressed in all three clusters (Figure 5c ), IL2RA (CD25) was selectively upregulated in Cluster 14, which also expressed PDCD1(PD-1) (Figure 5d ). Therefore, CD25 + PD-1 + T cells were highly enriched in Cluster 14 of T cells in BALF from COVID-19 patients. Notably, Cluster 14 co-expressed CD38 and MKI67(Ki67) (Figure 5d) . A recent study comprehensively analysed T-cell and B-cell subsets in COVID-19 patients and found that PD-1 + CD38 + Ki67 + T cells were increased in blood of patients with more severe disease. 11 Compared to Cluster 9, Cluster 14 demonstrated higher expression of survival marker BCL2, inflammatory cytokine IFNG and key molecules constituting the IL-2 signalling pathway including STAT5A and PRDM1 (Blimp1) (Figure 5e ). 16 Although both effector T-cell clusters expressed significant levels of GZMB (Granzyme B) (Figure 5f ), Cluster 9 showed stronger expression of cytotoxic molecules PRF1 (Perforin) and FASLG (Fas ligand) than Cluster 14, accompanied by increased expression of ID2, the transcription factor supporting effector T-cell differentiation 25 (Figure 5g ). These results suggested that Cluster 9 displayed a phenotype associated with short-lived effector cells whereas CD25 + PD-1 + Cluster 14 had certain features of effector memory cells showing enhanced survival and proliferation. 25 We then compared the percentages of different clusters in samples from patients with moderate or severe COVID-19. 10 Cluster 6, as na\u20ac \u0131ve and resting memory T cells, were comparable between moderate and severe patients (Figure 5h ). In contrast, Cluster 9, likely to be short-lived effector T cells, reduced significantly by~2-fold while CD25 + PD-1 + CD38 + Ki67 + Cluster 14, representing effector or effector memory T cells with enhancing survival and proliferation, expanded 3-4 fold in severe illness, despite not reaching a statistical significance due to sample variation (Figure 5h ). These analyses of BALF T cells from patient again supported a notion that the better generation of short-lived effector T cells was associated with enhanced control of the disease while the expansion of CD25 + PD-1 + T cells with pro-inflammatory function and better proliferation and survival might drive disease severity, echoing the observation in the mouse model ( Figure 4 ). Since PD-1 + CD38 + Ki67 + T cells, closely related to CD25 + PD-1 + CD38 + Ki67 + Cluster 14, were found increased in blood of patients with more severe disease, 11 further studies are required to investigate the relationship between CD25 + PD-1 + CD38 + Ki67 + T cells in BALF and disease severity or viral shedding.",

Importantly, CD25 + PD-1 + T cells were also found expanding in BALF of patients with severe COVID-19 compared with modest patients. These results support a model whereby patients with severe disease might mount insufficient anti-viral immunity so that persistent viral stimulation, IL-2 signalling and other factors drive excessive pro-inflammatory Tcell response, providing a possible explanation to reconcile the mixed phenotype of T cells in patients with severe COVID-19. The molecular mechanism underlying the distinction between the cytolytic and pro-inflammatory function of T cells is not fully understood. However, a recent study revealed that the alternation of TCR signalling via modulating CD3 subunits can maintain the killing function while reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-2, IFN-c and TNFa, 26 which were found to be associated with CD25 + PD-1 + T cells in this study.",

In the mouse model of infection with SARS-CoV, the augmentation of anti-viral T-cell responses could enhance viral clearance and ameliorate lung pathology, thus preventing otherwise uniformly lethal infection in aged mice. 28 The divergence between anti-viral and proinflammatory T-cell responses implies a two-stage therapeutic strategy. The initial therapy should aim to enhance anti-viral immunity to reduce viral loads while, at the second stage of excessive inflammation, the treatment should target nonspecific activation of the immune system, including CD8 + T cells. The identification of elevated sCD25 levels and the expansion of CD25 + PD-1 + CD8 + T cells provided potential biomarkers to determine the imbalance of anti- viral vs pro-inflammatory T-cell responses in acute viral infection. This should be validated in additional patient cohorts using pseudotime analysis. Notably, respiratory syncytial virus infections in children showed infants with severe bronchiolitis had increased serum levels of sCD25. [29] [30] [31] Similarly, patients with severe H1N1 infections had elevated levels of sCD25 compared to patients with mild infections. 32 By examining monitoring immune signatures of hospitalised patients infected with A/H7N9 influenza virus, rapid and robust anti-viral T-cell responses were found in patients with early recoveries while delayed and diminished responses were associated with prolonged hospital or fatal outcomes. 33 Together, these results from different viral infections in multiple human studies suggest that a divergence between anti-viral and proinflammatory T-cell responses might represent a common mechanism that drives the illness, with sCD25 as a potential biomarker.",
