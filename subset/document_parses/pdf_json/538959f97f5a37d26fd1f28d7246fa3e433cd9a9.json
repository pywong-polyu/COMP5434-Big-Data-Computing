Applying and removing restrictions on a system with uncontrollable inertia, as represented by an epidemic outbreak, may create critical instabilities, overshoots and strong oscillations of infected people around the desirable set-point, defined as the maximum number of hospitalizations acceptable by a given healthcare system. A good understanding of the system reaction to a change of the input control variable can be reasonably achieved using a proportional-integral-derivative controller, widely used in technological applications. In this paper we make use of this basic control theory for understanding the reaction of COVID-19 propagation to social restrictions and for exploiting a very known technology to reduce the epidemic damages through the correct tuning of the containment policy.",

Since a sizeable fraction of people infected by COVID-19, especially older and with underlying preexisting medical problems, are likely do develop serious illness with a fatality rate well above the typical seasonal influenza [3] , many countries have adopted drastic or moderated social restrictions with the goal of reducing and controlling R 0 by limiting the population mobility that determines the interaction among people.",

The best condition, would then be a compromise, in which R 0 is brought close to the unity (or, better, \u2264 1) with the number of active cases reasonably close to a given threshold represented by the capability of a healthcare system to maximize the number of recovered people and to avoid the system collapse. This threshold is of course close to the maximum number of available intensive care hospitalizations.

It is worth nothing that if the system response is known a priori, the control condition can be determined mathematically independently of the PID mechanism, or alternatively one can calculate the PID coefficients a priori. We will forget anyway this aspect and we will proceed as if the epidemic system response was completely unknown. This generalizes the specific control to a real epidemic system, as the COVID-19, i.e. not completely modelled in all its, sometimes unknown, details. In the model we distinguish three categories of individuals, known as compartments: S(t) for the number of susceptible, I(t) for the number of infectious and R(t) for the number of recovered, or better removed. The last category might include recovered and deceased individuals together or separately.

The implementation assumes the basic reproduction number as input parameter and the number of infected (or active cases) as output.

For our basic model we show that the best way of achieving an optimal control is to react promptly at the beginning of the pandemic by lowering the mobility of a factor two and then increase the social restrictions slowly in order to reach the desired set-point, affordable by the healthcare system. Anyway this procedure is desirable when the pandemic is already out-of-control over a wide geographical area, because the first attempt should be of course the complete confinement of the outbreak, by drastically limiting the patient zero area and nearest contacts, when possible.",
