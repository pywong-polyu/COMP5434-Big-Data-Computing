Study design In a retrospective cohort study, linear mixed models were used to compare growth outcomes from birth to 24 months corrected age for very low birth weight (VLBW) infants with surgical NEC to those with spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP). Kaplan-Meier curves were developed to demonstrate the duration of parenteral nutrition (PN) use. Result Height differed by surgical NEC and SIP over time (interaction p = 0.03). Surviving infants with surgical NEC had lower head circumference z-scores at 24 months. Of infants surviving surgical NEC, 71% received PN for >60 days after diagnosis. Conclusion The majority of infants with surgical NEC have a delay in achieving enteral autonomy. There was a difference in linear catch-up growth over time between infants with SIP and surgical NEC at 24 months.",

Inability to provide enteral feeding during the acute phase of the disease, incomplete bowel length following surgical resection, malabsorption, and complications like obstruction or stricture are all risk factors for growth failure even with use of parenteral nutrition (PN). Infants with severe NEC are at risk for intestinal failure, or the inadequate intestinal absorption of nutrients that leads to growth failure and dependence on PN [1] . Optimizing growth in these infants can improve neurodevelopmental outcomes [2] . It is known that higher parenteral protein provision following surgery for NEC leads to improved head circumference growth [3] . Understanding which of these factors are modifiable will assist care providers in focusing resources.",

VLBW infants with SIP were chosen as the control as they were expected to have comparable average birth weights and gestational ages. Additionally, both groups experience a surgical procedure and are expected to receive similar management by being cared for by the same group of surgeons and neonatologists (e.g., ventilator support, antibiotic use, etc.). These groups might have different functional ability to achieve enteral autonomy, or independence from PN [4] .

This institution provides consistent nutritional management for such patients with oversight by a dedicated NICU intestinal rehabilitation rounding team. The Institutional Review Board at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC) approved this study prior to initiation of study procedures (IRB# 9223). The list of potentially eligible subjects was generated through billing codes in the electronic medical record (Fig. 1 ). This data set was also used in a separate analysis; details of classification of the infants is described elsewhere [5] . Manual chart review of clinical and surgical data including progress notes, surgical reports, and pathology reports, was accomplished through agreement by two study investigators to verify diagnosis and determine study inclusion. A third investigator adjudicated in case of dissent. Subjects were excluded if they did not meet diagnostic criteria for either SIP or NEC, if they had a birth weight greater than 1500 g, if they had a diagnosis of both SIP and NEC, or if NEC or SIP was a historical diagnosis and infant did not receive care for the disease during the admission at the study institution. Infants were excluded if they had a congenital gastrointestinal anomaly such as gastroschisis. NEC was classified by the modified Bell's staging criteria, and infants were designated \"surgical NEC\" if they received a peritoneal drain or laparotomy for treatment of NEC [6, 7] . Study data were extracted from the electronic medical record, and then collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture (REDCap) tools hosted at CCHMC [8] .",

Although both cohorts had significantly decreased height z-scores from birth to discharge, SIP infants had more catch up growth at 18-24 months of corrected age whereas the height z-scores of surgical NEC infants remained similar from discharge to 18-24 months of corrected age. We did not find a statistically significant difference in the weight outcomes in VLBW infants with surgical NEC or SIP. This is a surprising finding, given that infants with surgical NEC underwent bowel resection, had longer length of stay during their initial NICU hospitalization, and had greater use of PN and elemental formula compared to SIP infants. Although it was not a statistically significant difference, there was a trend towards higher numbers of subspecialist follow up appointments and additional hospitalizations in the group with surgical NEC. While many of these infants met the classic definitions of \"extrauterine growth failure\" or \"postnatal growth failure\" (weight < 10th percentile at discharge), experts have recently suggested that other growth metrics are more important for predicting neurodevelopmental outcomes [12] . Postnatal head-sparing growth may be critical to optimize neurodevelopment, and this is important as infants with NEC are at risk for neurodevelopmental impairment [13] [14] [15] [16] .",

Our study is novel in that it adds the details of nutritional management and reveals the growth differences in surgical NEC despite the prolonged duration of PN. Enteral autonomy is a consideration for classifying infants with intestinal failure, as this functionally defines whether infants are dependent on PN for survival. One definition of intestinal failure in infants is the need for PN for greater than 90 days [4, 20] . Other experts use a cutoff duration of 60 days [21, 22] . Using either definition, a substantial proportion of infants with surgical NEC fulfilled the criteria for intestinal failure. This was true even though only 29% of these infants had short bowel syndrome per remaining intestinal length. In addition, 19.5% of the infants with medical NEC received >60 days of PN after diagnosis. Notably, most infants with medical NEC would be cared for in the regional Level 3 birth hospitals and only transferred to CCHMC for the need for subspecialist care, so this represents a biased population of infants with medical NEC. It is clear that the ability to achieve enteral autonomy is more complex than the length of bowel resected.

The beginning of the epoch for inclusion was chosen to follow infants after institutional changes were made to the care of preterm infants, such as establishment of a donor milk protocol [23] . The endpoint was chosen so that all included infants would have growth outcome and follow up data through 24 months corrected age. Along with the low rates of NEC at our institution, this limited the potential sample size. Multicenter studies or networks might be able to generate a larger sample size, but they may have difficulty attaining the level of detail in management choices that we are able to describe. The results of this study may help inform future larger, multicenter studies.",

Use of elemental formula as a supplement to maternal milk following surgical NEC, for example, is part of our evidence-based approach to allow for bowel adaptation that may be center-specific [4, 24, 25] . Although patient and family variables are factored into a decision to place a gastrostomy tube or send an infant home with PN, there may be considerable center-based variations in care [21] . Our intestinal rehabilitation team considers continuous enteral feeding to be a critical element to assist in bowel remodeling for patients with intestinal failure, and gastrostomy tubes are placed to deliver continuous enteral feeding. Some of the foci of management strategies at our center include careful postoperative fluid and nutritional management, early and aggressive enteral feeding advancement, and use of PN to achieve goal macronutrient provision [25] . There is emerging literature on biomarkers to predict intestinal recovery [26] . Novel treatments such as teduglutide, a recombinant human glucagon-like peptide-2 analog that promotes an intestinal adaptive response, may be the next strategy to achieve enteral autonomy in these patients [27] .",
