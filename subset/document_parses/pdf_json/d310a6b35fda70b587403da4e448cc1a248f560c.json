It is common in the intensive care unit and is associated with poorer outcomes. Good quality sleep is important in the prevention and management of delirium. Melatonin is a natural hormone secreted by the pineal gland which helps in the regulation of the sleep-wake cycle. It is possible that melatonin supplementation in intensive care improves sleep and prevents delirium. Methods and design: The 'Prophylactic Melatonin for Delirium in Intensive Care' study is a multi-centre, randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether melatonin given prophylactically decreases delirium in critically ill patients. A total of 850 ICU patients have been randomised (1:1) to receive either melatonin or a placebo. Participants were monitored twice daily for symptoms of delirium.",

The SAP has been developed and submitted for publication before the database has been locked and before the treatment allocation has been unblinded. The SAP contains details of analyses to be undertaken, which will be reported in the primary and secondary publications. Discussion: The SAP details the analyses that will be done to avoid bias coming from knowledge of the results in advance. This trial will determine whether prophylactic melatonin administered to intensive care unit patients helps decrease the rate and the severity of delirium.",

It is particularly common in patients in intensive care units (ICU), with a wide range of prevalence reported in the literature (11-80%) [2] [3] [4] . Delirium in ICU is associated with poorer outcomes, including higher mortality, more time on a ventilator, increased length of stay (LOS), greater postoperative complications, increased need for tracheostomy, increased medical costs, and higher risk of dementia and cognitive impairment [3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

LOS was chosen in addition to the percentage of delirium-free assessments as a significant relationship between delirium and LOS has been observed. Delirium assessment is by its nature subjective and the investigators wished to also allow the study to be powered to detect a reduction of LOS of 1 day (as an objective patient-orientated outcome). An audit of 100 patients across the two primary sites was used to provide preliminary data to guide sample size calculations where an average of 54% of assessments were deemed delirium free (standard deviation of \u00b1 45%). The research group is interested in being able to detect a 10% increase in the percentage of delirium-free assessments. This would require a sample size calculation of 319 per group. Adjustment for non-parametric data (15%) increases this to 367 per group. It is expected that up to 10% of patients recruited in the study will not be assessable for delirium at any point during the study. To account for this, and missing data/loss to follow-up, the sample size was increased by 15% to 423 patients per group (total rounded to 850).",
