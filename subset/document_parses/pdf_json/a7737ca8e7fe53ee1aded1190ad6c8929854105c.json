Additionally, the rate of cesarean sections is among the highest in the world and questions remain regarding the increased risk of postoperative morbidity and mortality for patients with COVID-19 undergoing surgery. 8 Our findings identified diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and obesity as significant conditions associated with mortality in the obstetric population, similar to the general population ( to 14.6% of all fatal cases, while the remaining 21,4% received non-invasive ventilation only. Failure to adequately report these variables in the surveillance system cannot be ruled out due to its retrospective nature. The data seem to reflect that obstetric patients may face barriers to access ventilators and intensive care. This is not a novel issue within the Brazilian healthcare system and it is aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic; shortage of healthcare providers and lack of intensive care resources are well-described chronic challenges in Brazilian maternity services. 9 ",

Since only women presenting with severe symptoms are tested, it is certain that the number of COVID-19 infections in this population is underreported.
