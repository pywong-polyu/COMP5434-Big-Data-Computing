We plan to enrol 1,000 patients in Denmark, Sweden, Switzerland and India. The primary outcome is days alive without life support (invasive mechanical ventilation, circulatory support or renal replacement therapy) at day 28. Secondary outcomes include serious adverse reactions at day 28; all-cause mortality at day 28, 90 and 180; days alive without life support at day 90; days alive and out of hospital at day 90; and health-related quality of life at day 180. The primary outcome will be analysed using the Kryger Jensen and Lange test adjusted for stratification variables and reported as adjusted mean differences and median differences. The full statistical analysis plan is outlined in this protocol.",

[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Until recently, the care of COVID-19 patients was primarily supportive, including respiratory support. On 16 June 2020, the preliminary results of the Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY (RECOVERY) trial were publicly announced. 8 In this randomised clinical trial (RCT), 6,425 hospitalised patients with suspected or confirmed COVID- 19 were randomised to open-label dexamethasone 6 mg daily for up to 10 days or usual care. 8 The results demonstrated a 17% relative risk reduction (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.74 to 0.92%) in 28-day mortality with dexamethasone with a possible larger clinical benefit in patients receiving invasive mechanical ventilation. 8 The results from all critically ill patients included in the RECOVERY trial and 6 other ongoing or recently completed RCTs were summarised in a prospective meta-analysis that demonstrated lower 28-day mortality among patients who received corticosteroids as compared with usual care or placebo (odds ratio (OR) 0.66, 95% CI 0.53 to 0.82). 9 Following these results, updated guidelines from the World Health Organization (WHO), the National Institutes of Health and the Infectious Diseases Society of America now recommend systemic low-dose corticosteroids for 7-10 days in patients with COVID-19 requiring supplemental oxygen. [10] [11] [12] In July 2020, we surveyed doctors at potential COVID STEROID 2 trial sites to assess clinician's preferences for systemic corticosteroid use in patients with severe COVID-19 after the preprint publication of the RECOVERY trial (unpublished data).",
