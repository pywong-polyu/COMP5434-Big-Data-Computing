It is an India-and US-based international human rights organization that mainstreams discussions about violence against women and girls by harnessing the power of pop culture, media and community mobilization to inspire people. It mainly targets the youth and sensitizes them. Breakthrough has launched one campaign-What kind of man are you? (2005)-on domestic violence. Communications tools used included print ads, radio spots, in-theatre PSAs and billboards, all of which have since been translated into seven languages. The campaigns reached 75 million people and prompted more than 8,000 text messages and other inquiries to Breakthrough's anonymous query hotline. (15) .",
