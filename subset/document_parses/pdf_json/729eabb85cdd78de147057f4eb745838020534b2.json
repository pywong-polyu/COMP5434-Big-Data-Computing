In the study, a cross-sectional analysis was performed of all the patients admitted with SARS-COV-2 infection confirmed by PCR to an asthma reference center in a hospital serving a population of 500,000 inhabitants, from March 1 to June 30. Age, sex, asthma status and the presence of comorbidities were recorded from the electronic medical records. In patients with asthma, data on the phenotype, severity and treatment received were also compiled. The severity of COVID-19 was recorded based on the needs of oxygen and ventilatory support and the chest x-ray findings. Disease was defined as severe if the patient needed FiO 2 <40%, very severe if they needed FiO 2 > 40%, and critical if they needed ventilatory support. The patients were divided into two groups: T2 (with the subgroups T2-Th2 and T2-ILC2) and Non-T2 (Table 1) . Patients were considered to have a T2-Th2 phenotype if, according to clinical history, they were allergic, a T2-ILC2 phenotype if they were not allergic and if an absolute eosinophil count of more than 300 cells per cubic millimeter were found in peripheral blood, and a non-T2 phenotype if the above criteria were not met.",

It may seem counter-intuitive that, although excessive T2 inflammation is known to facilitate viral exacerbations of asthma (15) , in these patients it is a protective element and that the presence of a cellular environment in which there is a T2 response with an increased presence of cytokines in the Th2 pathway may protect against SARS-COV-2 infection.
