Customs offices worldwide have traditionally relied on local resources to accumulate knowledge and detect tax fraud. This naturally poses countries with weak infrastructure to become tax havens of potentially illicit trades. The current paper proposes DAS, a memory bank platform to facilitate knowledge sharing across multi-national customs administrations to support each other. We propose a domain adaptation method to share transferable knowledge of frauds as prototypes while safeguarding the local trade information. Data encompassing over 8 million import declarations have been used to test the feasibility of this new system, which shows that participating countries may benefit up to 2-11 times in fraud detection with the help of shared knowledge. We discuss implications for substantial tax revenue potential and strengthened policy against illicit trades.",

However, these advanced models only benefit customs offices that have the capacity to build deep learning models and train them. Many developing and low-income countries do not have such data infrastructure. One method to bootstrap model learning is to utilize shared logs of frauds across custom offices within geographical proximity, as illicit patterns are likely similar in those regions. Sharing knowledge can facilitate data initiative and strengthen policy against illegal trade activities. However, \u2020 Corresponding authors data sharing has not been considered due to privacy concerns, as trade information entails critical industry and business relationships. This research proposes a first-of-a-kind collaborative customs fraud detection system that enables information sharing across regional boundaries. We use techniques in domain adaptation and propose a new data prototyping method to extract transferable knowledge from import declarations. Figure 1 illustrates the workflow. Data donors or source countries share logs of speculative trades, for instance, 1,000 import declarations after removing identifiable information like importer names. Information about the vast majority of normal trades is not shared. Furthermore, instead of the raw data, its embedding is shared in the form of prototypes. At the receiving end, target countries access the accumulated knowledge of fraud patterns from the memory bank and refine their local knowledge via soft attention. Target countries that typically lack infrastructure will likely observe new fraud transactions thanks to the model. This information will loop back to the central memory bank to strengthen the combined knowledge and be shared with all contributing members.",

Contrastive learning is used to extract discriminative features between classes (Kang et al. 2019; Thota and Leontidis 2021) , and the memory module is used to augment target features using incremental information (Asghar et al. 2020; Zheng and Yang 2019; Liu et al. 2020) .

Regularization and adaptive source selection methods have been proposed to mitigate this problem Abuduweili et al. 2021) .

Vanilla transfer learning (i.e., passing only model parameters) may suffer from the catastrophic forgetting problem, in which the finetuned model tends to \"forget\" the source dataset's discriminative feature during fine-tuning (Kirkpatrick et al. 2017 ). To avoid this fallacy, we adopt the memory bank concept (Wu et al. 2018 ) to enhance the model capacity by storing additional representations from the source dataset D s in the memory bank. We compress knowledge as a prototype, a representative embedding for a group of semantically similar instances. This structure also ensures that shared knowledge no longer contains individual trade information. After pretraining, knowledge of frauds and non-frauds is clustered separately and condensed to generate transferrable prototypes. We apply K-means clustering to extract the centroid set as prototypes for each class (i.e., C s = C frauds \u222aC non-frauds ). These extracted prototypes C s are stored in the memory bank M , allowing knowledge transfer from the source country s. Recipients can utilize any subset of the transferred knowledge for their classification task and detect previously unrecognized illicit trades in D t .",

For the target country M, the use of DAS from country N increases the tax revenue 11 times from 0.0466 to 0.5152. The exact benefit differs by country, implying that various factors like the log similarity between countries may play a role. Parameter sharing (i.e., column indicated as Vanilla Transfer) sometimes leads to degraded performance due to negative transfer. Transfer learning via the adaptive knowledge consistency technique (i.e., Adaptive Transfer) no longer shows this limitation. Sharing knowledge in the form of prototypes shows the best performance in terms of tax raised, as indicated in the final column of the table. Note this method also increases data protection of the source countries. (1) when no knowledge is shared and only the target country's logs are used for detection, (2) when the source country's knowledge is shared via direct parameter sharing, (3) when knowledge is shared via transfer learning to mitigate the negative transfer problem, and (4) when knowledge is further embedded as prototypes and shared as proposed in our system. The ratio of tax raised by DAS is substantial compared to other settings. Exp 2. Multi-Source Scenarios Accumulating knowledge from more than one country further increases the performance of the fraud detection system. Figure 4 shows the average Revenue@5% for using no source at all, a single source, two sources, and three sources. To compute, we averaged the performance of all possible combinations according to the number of source countries. The additional gain in raised tax is most noticeable for using a single source, yet there is a revenue gain with every added source. When all available source knowledge is used, the target countries benefit nearly 2 to 11 times increase in total tax raised.

Efficacy of Memory Contents Additionally, we discuss the augmentation effect when the source knowledge is transferred through the memory bank. For comparison, we consider a baseline of random memory bank with the same size, inspired by the prior work that randomly injected noise provides practical benefits to deep models (Poole, Sohl-Dickstein, and Ganguli 2014) . Table 5 shows that memory bank usage provides non-trivial improvements than using random memory banks. This finding confirms that information shared by source countries is successfully leveraged in the form of prototypes. Exp 6. Dependency on Prototype Count Knowledge of frauds is shared as compressed representations called prototypes. The number of prototypes can determine the resolution of transferred knowledge. For instance, one may assume selective fraud patterns may be shared when limiting the prototype count. We test the sensitivity of the model on prototype count |C s | by setting it from 10 to as large as the source data size |D s |. Table 6 shows detection performance remains intact by |C s |, implying that the model is not sensitive to the choice of hyper-parameters as long as the prototypes are used.

Custom offices with weaker infrastructure will likely observe the largest increase in raised tax, whereas the more equipped customs offices will see a smaller gain. However, the benefit needs to be interpreted in two other aspects. First, once the system is set up, the cost of fine-tuning for additional prototypes will be minimal. Hence, any increase in detection performance translates to a potentially substantial additional tax revenue in the target country. Second, empowering countries with weak infrastructure will enable the detection of new fraud patterns that were previously unseen. The new fraud patterns collected from target countries will be shared back to the memory bank. This helps strengthen policy against illicit trades by removing weak spots in the global trade chain and further benefit participating countries (Wang 2018) . Qualitative analysis can be used to show how well the shared information discriminates against illicit transactions. Figure 6 compares embedding results of the target country, without knowledge (i.e., left) and with knowledge (i.e., right). Using the source-enhanced features helps better distinguish frauds from non-frauds. This particular example shows a fraud case that was newly detected by DAS. Without the shared knowledge, this declaration would have been missed. In contrast, the knowledge augmentation placed this declaration more closer to the fraudulent cluster in the embedding.",

In addition, the product categories that frequently appear in fraud-like logs and normal logs have different rank orders, as illustrated in the examples.
