In 1989, Williams and Pembroke were the first to report the dog's ability to detect malignant tumors 2 . Since then, many studies have been published advocating the ability of canines to detect many non-infectious and infectious diseases. Indeed, K9 dogs were successfully trained and used to detect different types of cancers 3 , diabetes 4 , epilepsy 5 , bacteriuria 6 , malaria 7 , and viruses 8 . The chemical basis for such precise and sophisticated olfactory sense is the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOC) that represent a large range of stable chemical compounds, volatile at room temperature, and are detectable in body secretions. There is growing evidence that diseased cells produce a different pattern of VOCs than that of normal cells 9 . These VOCs are likely to have a distinct odor that seems unfathomable to humans.",

Soon after the start of the pandemic, detection of viral nucleic acid for screening purposes replaced the conventional thermal scanners around the globe due to the poor efficacy of thermal scanners. Although different viral nucleic acid (vRNA) detection methods have been reported 10, 11 , quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) is the one being widely used. The type of clinical specimen has been also shown to influence the sensitivity of RT-PCR. For example, lower respiratory tract specimens showed the highest positive rate followed by sputum and nasal swabs. Feces and blood had the poorest rates and no virus was detected in urine samples 12, 13 . These tests vary in sensitivity and specificity. Pooled analysis from 16 studies estimated sensitivity of 87.8% (95% CI 81.5-92.2%) for an initial reverse-transcriptase PCR test 14 . Current available evidence also suggests that the specificity of the test is moderate (63-78%). It means that a positive test is highly suggestive of true COVID-19, but a negative test does not rule out the disease 15 . A number of factors, varying from reagents to the technical staff, have been proposed to be associated with the inconsistency of RT-PCR 16 .",

Several tests were developed for disease screening, diagnosis, and monitoring. Those included molecular, serological, thermal, and other testing platforms. The tests would detect viral nucleic acid, viral antigens, antibodies, cytokines, or other viralrelated indicators. Initially, thermal scanners were introduced at the ports of entry to control the spread of the disease. However, the identification of symptomless carriers significantly reduced the efficacy of their use in detecting COVID-19 positive patients. On the other hand, the widely used RT-PCR is costly, requires trained staff, expensive equipment, and reagents. The long turnaround-time hampers its use for fast and long-term mass screening. Keeping in view the success of canine olfaction in the detection of human disease with ample scientific evidence, it is suggested to evaluate the use of canines for the detection of COVID-19 patients.",

This approach is associated with much reporting bias 21, 22 . The diagnostic test characteristics of real-time PCR and detection dogs tests have never been compared. On the other hand, Bayesian latent class analysis models (BLCMs) present a suitable option for the simultaneous estimation of sensitivity and specificity of two or more tests without any assumption about the underlying true disease status of each subject 23 . To the best of our knowledge, there are no published studies that apply a BLCM framework to quantify the accuracy of RT-PCR and K9 test for the assessment of COVID-19 infection in the human population. The objective of the present study is to estimate the Se and Sp of real-time PCR on nasal samples and K9 test on sweat samples for the detection of COVID-19 virus within a Bayesian framework and compare it to the traditional diagnostic test evaluation assuming PCR as a gold standard. Additionally, the true withinprevalence of COVID-19 infection in the investigated populations was estimated.",

The presented data show that as the prior probability, which reflects the prevalence of infection, increases, the PPV of the test will also increase. A 10 times increase in prevalence, from 0.005 to 0.05, will more than double the PPV of the test from 0.35 to 0.85. Similarly, a 10 times increase in prevalence from 0.01 to 0.1, will almost double the PPV of the test, from 0.52 to 0.92. The NPV, however, shows a slight decrease as the prevalence increases. This reciprocal variability relationship between PPV and NPV at variable prior probabilities of infection is illustrated in Fig. 1 . The high NPV of the K9 dogs test supports the use of this test for screening purposes as it will screen out individuals who do not need to do the more expensive, time-consuming, and labor-intensive RT-PCR test.",

Training in imprinting phase two was completed in 2 days containing an average of three sessions per day, consisting of four line-ups on average, and a total of 24 positive samples and 192 mock samples. Training in imprinting phase three was completed in 1 week, 5 days training consisting of three training sessions per day, where each session contained an average of four line-ups. Training in imprinting phase four was completed in 4 weeks, 5 days per week training, containing an average of three sessions per day; each training session consisted of an average of four line-ups, and a total of 234 positive samples and 144 negatives samples were used in the imprinting phase three and four. After completing the imprinting phases, the trained dogs were taken to the operational setting for acclimatization and testing. During this stage, the samples were collected and tested from randomly selected persons.

Basically, BLCMs are premised on three key assumptions: (1) the target population should consist of two or more subpopulations with different prevalences, (2) the sensitivity and specificity of the index tests should be constant across the subpopulations, and (3) the tests should be conditionally independent (CID) given the disease status 23 .

Comparing the diagnostic accuracy of the detection dogs and the real-time PCR tests using Bayesian latent class analysis (LCA). A Bayesian latent class model fitted in OpenBUGS v3.2.2 was used to infer the sensitivity and specificity of the two tests (K9 test and RT_PCR) 44 , as well as the two populations (African and Asian) prevalences as per the standards for reporting diagnostic accuracy studies that use STARD-BLCMs 45 . In particular, the test accuracy of the diagnostic tests under evaluation was assumed to be similar across the study populations, i.e., sensitivity and specificity constancy. The two tests under evaluation (K9 test and RT_PCR) are based on two different principles of action assuming a conditional independence between the two tests.

Each qRT-PCR reaction mix contained 1\u00d7 TaqMan Fast Virus-1-Step Master Mix (Life Technologies), 250 nM of TaqMan probe, 400 nM of each PCR primer, and 5 \u00b5L of extracted RNA. qRT-PCR was performed with a Thermal Cycler (BioRad, Model CFD3240). The RT-PCR had a temperature profile of 55\u00b0C for 20 min, then 95\u00b0C for 3 min, followed by 45 cycles of amplification (95\u00b0C for 30 s and 60\u00b0C for 1 min). latent class analysis. Owing to the imperfection of reference tests, the Bayesian latent class analysis models (BLCMs) present a suitable option for theFig. 2 Training stations lined up at the Federal Customs Authority (FCA) facilities in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, for the training of explosives detection dogs. a Training devices with samples' containers placed right behind the metal olfaction cones. b The dog handler is deployed to work with the dog as a team.
