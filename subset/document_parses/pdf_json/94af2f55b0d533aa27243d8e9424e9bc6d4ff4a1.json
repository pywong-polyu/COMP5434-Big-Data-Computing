One such strategy in the primary prevention of cervical cancer is HPV school-based vaccination amongst girls aged 9-12 years (a bivalent vaccine [targeting HPV 16/18] with a 2-dose schedule [six months apart]) [10, 11] . Since its implementation in 2014, early indications are that vaccine coverage and uptake are high (86.6% vaccinated with the first dose) [10] ; however, the uptake between the first and second doses declines by about 25% [10] . Literature suggests parental vaccine hesitancy for the HPV vaccine might be higher than for other childhood vaccines [12, 13] . Long-term sustained effort should be considered to facilitate future successful implementation of HPV vaccination [10, 11] . Beyond vaccination efforts, current cervical cancer screening guidelines issued by the South African National Department of Health (SANDoH) recommend the provision of screening via Pap smear at intervals to the general population of low-risk women who are asymptomatic and HIV-negative. This includes three screening tests within a lifetime performed every 10 years, starting at 30 years of age until 50 years, as the onset of cervical cancer before 30 years is rare [11] . If an abnormality is detected, repeat screenings, including any required treatment, are recommended at three-yearly intervals until a screen result is negative [14] .",

HPV-based primary screening, as advocated for by the South African HPV Advisory Board, is supported by current literature and global practice [15] . HPV testing has a greater sensitivity in detecting precancerous lesions as compared to cytology, and allows for longer intervals between screening tests in the instance of negative screening results [14] .",

The American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology's (ASCCP) risk-based management guidelines suggest that additional evaluation (e.g., colposcopy with biopsy) is necessary even when cytology results are negative [18] , and surveillance with cytology, alone, is only acceptable if HPV screening or co-testing is not feasible [18] . The current South African Cervical Cancer Screening Guidelines suggest HPV testing where resources allow, and the HPV Advisory Board recommends the commencement of such screening at an earlier age of 25 years among HIV-negative women [14] .

However, given the high prevalence of HPV, the implementation of follow-ups for all HR-HPV-infected women could potentially add pressure on an already burdened primary healthcare system [29] . With other HR-HPV types making up the vast majority of infections in our study, there may be a more urgent need for clinical research on a larger valent (e.g.; 9-valent) vaccine product. While the Cervarix vaccine used by the nationwide vaccination programme protects more widely than just HPV-16 and 18 in other country populations [30] , it does not necessarily reduce the need for a nonavalent vaccine.",
