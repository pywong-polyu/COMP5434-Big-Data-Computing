            "text": "Background and Objective: pandemic has had devastating impacts on not only the health and socio-economic conditions but also on the education sector in various countries. Consequently, the world of education entered a new era of E-learning. This descriptive study, thus, aims to evaluate the standpoint of medical and dental undergraduates regarding E-learning amid the Covid-19 lockdown. Methods: A descriptive online questionnaire was used to gather responses via Google forms. The questionnaire consisted of questions categorized as technology access, online skills and relationships, students' views, and student's perception of possible advantages of E-learning. Two hundred and eighty three medical and dental students of CMH Lahore Medical College participated in the study. Results: One hundred and seventy nine female and 104 male students responded to the questionnaire. The results of the study showed students encouraging the accommodation of E-learning into current teaching practices. Students agreed online study material not only provides flexibility in the learning process (p = 0.003) but also saves time (p = 0.012). Female participants showed a more positive readiness response towards e learning than males (p = 0.001). Results also showed students have easier access to online teaching resources. Regarding online lectures, the students believe that online lectures were more organized (p = 0.001) and stimulated student interest (p = 0.026). Students believe that frequent participation in the learning process is important for success in online education (p = 0.002). Conclusion: Undergraduate medical and dental students from the said private medical college are well equipped and ready to shift towards online education.",

            "text": "COVID-19, beginning in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 remains an imperative problem affecting millions worldwide. 1 It was declared a pandemic on March 11, 2020 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and by March 25, 2020 the total confirmed cases that were reported rose to 414,179. 2 Together with infecting individuals' health, COVID-19 continues to damage the socio-economic conditions and education of any country it has touched, thus being more than just a medical emergency. 1, 3, 4 Countries lost no time in trying to combat the adversity by imposing strict restrictions on large gatherings, instructing individuals to practise social distancing, launching health promotion and disease prevention programs and so forth. 4 Flights to and from China were suspended by most countries and the governments urged on banning travel until the situation alleviates. 2, 5 With limitations on gatherings came the closure of malls, restaurants, workplaces, and educational institutions. Shutdown of educational institutions has caused the world to move towards E-learning. 6, 7 This, in turn, poses another challenge for countries with a low socio-economic status, like Pakistan. 8 Pakistan, as it continues to face a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases, had its institutions switch to E-learning as per instructions by the Higher Education Commission (HEC) of the country. 9 Under this list of institutions come the medical colleges of the country with both, the medical undergraduates and the lecturers, being affected by the shift from 'on-campus' classes to virtual lectures. 10, 11 Not being very familiar with such teaching methodologies, instructors and students struggle to consolidate these with their plan of continuing medical education while maintaining the quality of it. 12, 13 Lack of expertise in operating the electronic resources and the concomitant problem of limited access to the internet, computers and the other facilities due to social and economic setbacks is an obstacle for online learning and teaching. 14 Hence, this research was conducted with an aim to obtain the standpoint of medical and dental students of a private medical college in Pakistan regarding the transition to online learning, its effectiveness and their satisfaction over what has been achieved since the shift. This will add to the current studies concerning the readiness of students for adapting to this new mode of education. It is an especially important inclusion to literature that is aimed towards the incorporation of online learning in medical education.",

With undergraduate students from both MBBS and BDS taking part in this, the research was conducted from May to June 2020. A sample size of 283 participants was used which was calculated from Rao soft using the formula Z2p (1 -p) / m2 and a confidence level of 95%. The tolerable margin of error was kept at 5%. A 20 item questionnaire was used to gather responses via Google forms. Informed consent was taken from all participants prior to data collection. The response settings were done to restrict only one response from a person. The questionnaire contained statements used to assess the stand point of students regarding E-Learning. The statements were categorized into categories as follows: technology access, online skills and relationships, students' view and student's perceptions of possible advantages of E-Learning. With each statement, a 5 point Likert scale response was used from strongly agree (SA) to strongly disagree (SD). 15 The original version of the questionnaire used was developed by Watkins et al. 15 Permission to use questionnaire was obtained from the author through email. Ethical approval for this research was obtained from ethical review committee of CMH Lahore Medical College and Institute of Dentistry, Lahore (Reference Number 57/ERC/CMHLMC Dated 24th May 2020). All data gathered was entered into and analyzed by SPSS version 25. Frequencies and percentages were obtained for the responses and Chi-square test was used to compare responses based on gender. A p-value of < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.",

Percentage of participants with access to technological equipment was high (strongly agree=39.2% and agree=39.9%). Response of participants about possessing online skills and relationships was encouraging (44.9% answered strongly agree and 38.9% answered agree). The difference between the viewpoint of male students and female students in this category of variables was statistically different for each response as shown in Table-I. The next category, that is, students' point of view on online lectures, showed a positive response with 43.1% of participants agreeing that instructors were available and helpful. Along with this, 37.5% of the individuals could understand course related information via online videos. Furthermore, it was shown that 39.2% of the participants agreed on presentations being clear but 30.0% of these were not sure about whether the instructor stimulated interest and 28.6% of them disagreed. Further analysis of the statistics presented evidence of 32.2% of participants agreeing over frequent participation being pivotal for success in online lectures with 23.7% remaining unsure. The difference between the viewpoint on male students and female students is shown in Table-II. The final category, involving both students' perception of possible advantages of E-learning, indicated that 38.2% individuals agreed about E-learning providing flexibility in learning, however, a mixed response was observed regarding better understanding of lectures through online classes as statistics reveal 30.0% agreeing while 27,6% disagreeing. Additionally, a higher percentage (33.2) of participants disagreed over the possible benefit that E-learning can improve communication between teachers and students. A higher percentage of students strongly agreed (17.7%) and agreed (31.4%) on the possible advantage of saving time.

This suggests that e-learning has helped improve teaching concepts and has led to a reform with a student centred model being preferred by instructors. 19 The Covid-19 pandemic has led to transition to an online medium of instructions not only for preclinical years, but also in clinical sciences which has deferred the attainment of skills in many cases. According to literature review, there is continuous evolvement of options which may lead to modification of the educational calendar for students in their clinical years or instructors may employ virtual cases for demonstrations. 20 Based on our findings, this can be possibility as a majority agrees that online teaching stimulates student interest and is an efficient means for understanding as well as communication.",
