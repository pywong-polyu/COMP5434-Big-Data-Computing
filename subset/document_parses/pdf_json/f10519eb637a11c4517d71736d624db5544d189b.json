Can we just apply the general definition of a public good for all health goods? Should we consider different types of health goods? If yes, how do we delimit the frontier between a public good and a private good? With a rapid glance at the diversity of organizations in the healthcare system that exist in the world, it appears there is little consensus on what can and should be defined as a public good. Generally speaking, all countries have a mixed health system, combining pro-market elements with welfare state safeguards, and China is no exception: all reforms of the healthcare system implemented since the 1980s have swung between both. To understand the Chinese health system and its recent evolution, we need to start by defining the global framework in which the \"health good\" is set.",

All reforms of the healthcare system implemented since the 1980s have swung between both. 1 From 2003, and more intensively from 2009, a number of reforms have been implemented to facilitate universal access to basic care. The result is public healthcare coverage, designed for primary care improvement with the emphasis on a basic care basket accessible to all. All these reforms lean toward a pro-welfare state policy. At the end of 2013, following the Third Plenum of the 18th Central Committee of the Communist Party, a new set of reforms were launched, in favour of private hospital investment, including the privatization of some existing public hospitals, showing a clear shift towards a pro-market and competition policy.",

In our example, it can be the number of people at a given moment in the street.

This implies that the price has not been fixed by one side as a result of market condition. It is said that the price is a \"price taker\". \u2022 Homogeneity of product: health products or services are assumed identical, homogeneous, without differentiation, hence totally substitutable. In such cases, consumers can make trade-offs based on price only. In reality, there are differences amongst health goods. Yet, when these differences do not generate a non-substitutability, health goods can still be considered quite homogeneous. On the other hand, when there is non-substitutability, pure competition between health suppliers is no longer possible. This can explain the difficulties the Chinese regulator has in trying to improve the health system by setting up additional local health centres. For customers, being treated in a local centre or in an excellent quality level hospital are indeed non-substitutable. This also explains the congestion in the excellent quality level hospitals (called further Level 3 hospitals). \u2022 Freedom of entry and exit: no barrier prevents a producer or consumer from entering the market. Symmetrically, agents can leave the market at any time. This point emphasizes the asymmetry created by taxes imposed on a part of the healthcare market, namely the private sector. The public sector is immune to this financial burden. Besides, the obscurity of land rights regulations when setting up private healthcare centres may also explain the slow growth of a private healthcare institution market. \u2022 Transparency: the market delivers comprehensive information to agents on the nature, quality and price of available goods. We will see that this point is key for the establishment of a list of medical drugs considered as essential, including for generic medicine. \u2022 Mobility of production factors: labour and capital can move from one market to the other in the pursuit of better profit. Here, the doctor's status and the medical staff's level of training between the different areas, including rural and urban ones, is one reason for the inefficiency in the Chinese healthcare system.",

Recent reported scandals in Chinese newspapers regarding products widely praised in search engines but which turn out to be hazardous show the fragile level of information available to customers. Another story that made the headlines was about a 21-year-old Chinese student suffering from cancer. To select his treatment and hospital, he searched for information on the quality of the available treatments on Baidu. This is the number one search engine in China and it controls 80% of the search market. Unfortunately, the information he gathered turned out to be wrong. He publicized his distress about this erroneous information in a long post just before he died. 4 This drove Baidu to publishing a number of press releases, maintaining that ethics should come before profit. But is this really the role and responsibility of such a for-profit organization? What role should the regulator have in such cases? Should this kind of information not be distributed by a non-profit or public service organization? \u2022 In addition, there are usually not that many suppliers in the healthcare market. For instance, for drugs or medical devices, patents often ensure a monopoly situation on many products for some years. Likewise, hospitals delivering high quality standards tend to be in a monopoly situation in the area they cater for. They have an autonomous management making it possible for them, to a large extent, to set prices themselves. 5 Healthcare demand then has no choice but to accept the price quoted for the treatment. Depending on the severity of the affliction, two factors come into play. On the one side, demand from patients and their relatives tend to become increasingly price inelastic: 6 the health good is acquired, whatever its cost. Additionally, emergency is often linked to the severity factor of a pathology. Therefore, under the pressure of time, the price variable gets little scrutiny in the decision process, potentially leading to individual bankruptcy. This was a very common phenomenon in China before the implementation of public insurance. 7 These insurance schemes address patient solvency issues, but the market is still failing, as price is not the result of supply and demand but is set by the supplier. \u2022 As far as healthcare is concerned, there is a large gulf between supply and demand. Supply has extensive information about the state of the patient that he or she does not even possess. It is thus possible to generate unnecessary costs through over-diagnosis and overprescription of drugs and examinations. This phenomenon is called induced demand, in other words a surplus in demand caused by the supplier's behaviour and not by the patient's actual health needs. This has been observed in hospitals with high quality standards and has been extensively documented in empirical literature. 8 In the case of China, a \"zero mark-up\" 9 policy has been implemented for a few years by the government, in order to control the price of medical drugs prescribed to patients, with a very minimal margin rate for a list of drugs considered as essential. Yet, government price control over hospitals that have financial autonomy is tricky, in particular in the case where information is asymmetrical, the regulator having little data feedback from the ground level. For the regulator to actually assess the relevance of all procedures and prescriptions, a comprehensive information feed would be necessary as well adequate administrative resources to process this information.",

In the context of unequal distribution of revenue, elasticity can be observed the other way around, through income elasticity. For a healthcare demand that is considered fixed, there are three types of income elasticity. Inferior goods are goods whose consumption increases when income decreases: they are substitution goods to others that are no longer affordable. As an example, take medical drugs bought online: price is often the purchase trigger, as they are usually cheaper, but criticized for their dubious origin and quality. In that sense, they can be considered inferior goods. Similarly, online consultations are heavily debated as they have attractive prices but lack guarantees on the quality of diagnosis. Implicitly, what critics of online consultations denounce is their inferiority. They do not enable a comprehensive examination and complete diagnosis to be made and are substitutes for more expensive physical consultations. 10 Superior goods are goods where demand increases with income. As far as healthcare is concerned, these usually encompass goods that have little impact on vital prognoses. Finally, normal goods are goods where demand is not sensitive to income. This category includes the goods that pose a threat of personal bankruptcy, as patients and their families are likely to pay for heath goods until they are in financial difficulties.",

Depending on the criteria chosen to define good health, health policies and programmes can be very different from one country to the next. For example, in some countries such as France, some cosmetic surgery procedures are commonly reimbursed provided the positive psychological effects of the treatment are observed and described by a doctor. In many other countries, such as China, cosmetic surgery is never covered by any public insurance scheme. Scientific and technological innovations will also create new ways to address health that were previously not considered. The part they are to play in the \"health standard\" is yet to be defined and is currently very variable from one country to the next. Obviously, internet and connected devices bring about a whole new set of tools that improve information to patients and thus enable them to improve their health. This encompasses apps for smartphones targeted at the general public or devices such as connected watches that can measure sleep cycles, number of steps and calories burnt. But there are also more medically specialized devices such as those supporting patients with diabetes, by measuring glycemic levels through glucose capture in the abdomen or in the eye. They make it possible to identify the optimal timing for an insulin injection. Other devices can help address cardiac emergencies by measuring heart rate. Whether these devices should be covered by public insurance is currently a source of debate, and is dependent, among other things, on the nature of the good-superior, normal or inferior.",
