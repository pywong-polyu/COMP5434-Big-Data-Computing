[1] [2] [3] [4] TNF inhibitors may decrease symptoms and slow the progression of disease in these patients. 3, 4 Current guidelines from the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) recommend using TNF inhibitors in patients who do not respond to monotherapy with first-line disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs, such as methotrexate. 4 Numerous TNF inhibitors have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with the oldest being infliximab (Remicade, Janssen Biotech) which came to market in 1998. 5 In recent years, several biosimilars to infliximab have been developed, including infliximab-dyyb (Inflectra, Pfizer), infliximab-abda (Renflexis, Merck), infliximab-qbtx (Ixifi, Pfizer), and infliximabaxxq (Avsola, Amgen). 6 Biosimilars are highly similar to their respective originator reference products, with only minimal clinical differences in safety, purity, or potency. 7, 8 Although noninferiority or equivalency studies of biosimilars and their originator products are conducted, biosimilars are not often directly compared with each other. Thus, there may be unrecognized differences in efficacy or safety between biosimilar agents themselves. This lack of evidence makes it challenging for clinicians, payers, and healthcare organizations to make decisions about drug formularies and clinical care when choosing between biosimilars.",

There was no minimum sample size requirement for inclusion of a study in the meta-analysis.

Information on relative effects was converted to a probability that a treatment would be the best, second best, third best, fourth best, or worst by ranking each therapy according to the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). The SUCRA represents a numeric summary of A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t the overall rank distribution associated with each treatment and supplements graphical representations for a given outcome. The SUCRA value is 1 when a treatment is certain to be the best and 0 when a treatment is certain to be the worst. [21] [22] [23] Results Study characteristics. The initial literature search yielded 294 results. After removing duplicates, 192 article titles and abstracts were reviewed, which resulted in 181 exclusions. The most common reason for exclusion was a non-RCT article type. The remaining 11 articles underwent fulltext review and, of these, 6 were excluded ( Figure 1 ). Thus, a total of 5 studies that cumulatively enrolled 2,499 patients met inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis. A summary of these studies is provided in Table 1 . Figure 2 A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Risk of bias. All 5 of the included studies were determined to have a low overall risk of bias (eFigure 1). Although all studies were randomized, authors of 3 of the 5 studies failed to provide specific details on how the random allocation sequence was generated; however, based on reviewer judgment, this was not deemed to have resulted in a high risk of bias given that these were large, multicenter trials run by experienced clinical trial teams. This decision was acceptable under the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool (version 2) methodology. 16 Comparative efficacy. In general, individual study results for efficacy demonstrated equivalence of each biosimilar to the infliximab reference product in terms of ACR20 response (Table   1 ). Infliximab-axxq 24 and infliximab-dyyb 27,28 were the only products associated with a higher ACR20 response rate than the reference product, whereas infliximab-qbtx 25 and infliximab-abda 26 both were associated with lower response rates (albeit still within the prespecified equivalence margins).",

Overall, the point estimates and 95% CIs of our ACR20 efficacy results suggest that there are no clinically meaningful differences between agents. Although infliximab-axxq was found to have the highest probability of being the best at achieving ACR20 response based on SUCRA ranking probabilities, this result must be interpreted with caution. Specifically, SUCRA rankings may exaggerate small differences in relative effects, especially when based on data from a limited network 23 ; this is because SUCRA analysis does not consider the magnitude of the difference in effects. Therefore, it is A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t possible that the first-ranked treatment may be either slightly better or vastly better than the second-ranked treatment. Additionally, SUCRA values do not account for the possibility of random chance in the model. 23 Similar to the primary efficacy results, the results of analysis of SAEs showed comparable and nonsignificant differences between products. However, these safety results should also be interpreted with caution given that the follow-up period varied between studies from 22 to 54 weeks.

Biosimilars must undergo a rigorous comparison against the reference product in order to gain regulatory approval. Specifically, manufacturers must demonstrate biosimilarity through a totality-of-the-evidence approach, which includes structural and functional analytical studies, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic evaluations, and, if necessary, immunogenicity studies, animal studies, and other comparative clinical trials. 7 However, individual biosimilars are not directly compared with one another. Thus, although a biosimilar may be determined to be equivalent or noninferior to a reference product (depending on the study design), this does not preclude comparative differences between biosimilar agents. Thus, the results of this evaluation may help clinicians, payers, and healthcare organizations make decisions about the choice of biosimilar agent. With all other things being equal, product cost and contractual opportunities may become the primary deciding factor when selecting an infliximab biosimilar for formulary inclusion.",

Additionally, while the included studies were all highly similar with regard to methodology and design, follow-up periods differed significantly. Long-term data were available only for infliximab-dyyb and infliximab-abda, which could have impacted the applicability of our findings.

The results of the sensitivity analysis were consistent with findings of the primary efficacy analysis, indicating that follow-up period duration did not greatly impact the results (see eTable 2).

Given that only 5 studies met the inclusion criteria, the network was limited and reliant on indirect comparative evidence for biosimilar agents.

Mean patient ages ranged from approximately 50 to 55 years, and mean disease duration ranged from 6.4 to 8.5 years. Included patients across studies also had moderate to severe RA, as determined through assessment of the number of painful joints, number of swollen joints, and a composite measure consisting of the disease activity score for 28 prespecified joints (DAS28) plus scoring components based on C-reactive protein level. Although mostly similar to patient populations in the other evaluated studies, patients in the study of Takeuchi et al 28 may have had slightly less severe disease, as evidenced by a lower mean tender joint count and lower mean DAS28 value. Infliximab and biosimilar dosing and administration parameters were also identical across studies, with a 3-mg/kg dose infused at weeks 0, 2, and 6 and followed by a maintenance dose every 8 weeks thereafter. The primary difference between studies was the duration of follow-up, which ranged from 22 to 54 weeks.",
