When I wrote Welfare and Well-being: Social Value in Public Policy (2008), it had not been used since Schumpeter's The Nature and Essence of Economic Theory, 1908 (Trans. Bruce McDaniel. New Brunswick: Transaction Publishers (2010)), and then only to denote the value of collective goods. But the significance of social value in public policy has increased sharply during the coronavirus crisis, because of the polarisation in political responses to the pandemic and the economic recession it brought about, which seems certain to ensue as we emerge from lock-down.",

Because the divisive effects of the long stagnation in the real value of wages had fed into the Brexit vote, especially in the North of England, and strongly influenced the outcome of the December, 2019, General Election, an Immigration Bill to address the new situation was due to be debated in Parliament soon after the strictest phase of the lockdown was lifted.

The UK's administration felt obliged to offer asylum to some 3 million Hong Kong citizens with British passports, allowing them to enter the country and qualify for citizenship after six years. Even though there was evidence that many would not avail themselves of this opportunity because of family and community ties (BBC World Service, 'From Our Own Correspondent', 12 July, 2020), this would represent a dramatic change of direction in immigration policy.",

It accused the Bank of having 'manifestly' breached the principle of proportionality with mass bond purchases (of over 2.2 trillion euros and expected to rise further) and having trespassed from monetary to broad economic policy-making ('Germany's Top Court Clashes with European Central Bank in Revolutionary Ruling', by Ambrose Evans Pritchard, The Telegraph website, 5 May, 2020).",

Although this is remembered most vividly for the Christine Keeler scandal, over a Cabinet Minister's involvement with a high-class prostitute, the underlying issues which came to the surface then were issues over the country's future global role. With the independence of so many of the former Empire countries in Africa during the previous decade (what Macmillan called the 'Wind of Change'), there was a vacuum which became obvious, because the overture by the Prime Minister and his envoy, Edward Heath, towards General de Gaulle over membership of the European Community had been suddenly rebuffed.",

Having supported Britain's earlier attempt to join the European Common Market, he opposed membership in the 1970s, and became anti-American as well (Edgerton 2019, pp. 260-1) .",

Second, the ambitions of China, based on a combination of authoritarianism, technology and consumerism, are driving a new wave of globalisation, which poses a threat to liberty and human rights across large parts of Asia and Africa.
