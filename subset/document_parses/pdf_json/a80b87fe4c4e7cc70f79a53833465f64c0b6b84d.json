One explanation for a lack of known exposures is that COVID-19 transmits in spaces that are believed to be safe. A handful of studies have made some headway in identifying such situations. For example, one study found that COVID-19 could transmit through the air over relatively long distances [6] and another highlighted the impact of air conditioning vents [7] . A third study found that a cluster of 17 cases were traced to indirect transmission in shared spaces at a shopping mall in Wenzhou, China [8] . Still other studies have revealed that individuals in a constricted space could spread COVID-19 via inhaled transmission over potentially large distances by following airflow within a restaurant [7] and the Diamond Princess cruise ship [6] .",

            "text": "A recent review concluded that transmission within constricted indoor spaces is critically important [9] . However, outdoor exposures have been reported, yet relatively little is known about conditions that reduce safety of outdoor social contacts. There are reports of sporadic outbreaks in outdoor environments, including at a construction site in Singapore [10, 11] , jogging [10] , or during conversation [12] . Because of much lower risk outdoors [13] , close outdoor contacts are often described as being risk-free, and exposure-mitigating strategies have focused on promoting the use of exterior spaces when conducting social activities in efforts to mitigate risk of exposure. Outdoor gatherings (for example, participating in events such as backyard barbecues, sitting near to others while watching outdoor events, standing in line outside, or socializing outdoors), may be sensitive to circumstances that may influence their protective features. If exposure occurs outside, simulation studies suggest that transmission may be hampered by the same factors as are commonly seen in studies of indoor transmission including the air turnover rate [13] . Indeed, one preliminary study reported evidence of an association globally between weather dynamics including lower temperatures and lower wind speed with small increase in COVID-19 incidence [14] that may be non-linear [15] , with at least one locality in Indonesia reporting local findings supporting this pathway [16] .",

When exterior temperatures are warm enough (16-28 \u00b0C) to allow for outdoor social contacts to occur comfortably, we anticipated that increased wind speed would reduce overall transmission risk.

Negative binomial regression was chosen over alternatives including Poisson because we were concerned about the potential for over-dispersion in the outcome [19] since the infectious disease caseload is highly variable and because COVID-19 appears to spread commonly through super-spreading clusters [20] . A nine-day lag between exposure and case registration was assumed, consistent with epidemiological estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 [21, 22] coupled with a two-day testing and one-day reporting lag period that has been common in Suffolk County since testing became widely available. Unadjusted and multivariableadjusted incidence rate ratios (IRR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% C.I.) were reported. The interval between infection and disease ascertainment is unobserved and varies geographically by local testing availability and reporting systems: it can be reduced in places where testing is easy to find and lengthened in places where testing is difficult or requires hospitalization. As such, we conduct a sensitivity analysis considering the range of values of time intervals between exposure and case reporting. For our lagging period, we allowed four days because our experience suggests that it takes two days to report testing results to the Department of Health, and an additional day to report those results publicly. Fifteen days was selected as a ceiling for index case analysis to reduce the risk of sequential outcomes from prior case/exposure cycles consistent with prior publications [23] . However, in sensitivity analyses we report results for a 4-13-day range to clarify the impact of those choices. We used the log-likelihood to compare model fit for different lags.",

Current evidence suggests that COVID-19 is airborne and is predominantly spread indoors. The present study examined variations in wind speed under the hypothesis that higher winds may disperse COVID-19 viral particles away from people socializing outdoors, thereby offering increased protection among individuals who may have been exposed to COVID-19 outdoors. We found that slow average wind speed (< 8.85 KPH) was associated with increased incidence of COVID-19 on days that had temperatures supporting socializing outdoors (16-28 \u00b0C; aIRR = 1.45 [1.28-1.64], P < 0.001). This study supports the view that while transmission was lowest when days were in comfortable ranges (from 16 to 28 \u00b0C), on these days the risk was highest when wind speed was slow. This study suggests that low wind speed may reduce the protective impact of weather ranging from 16 to 28 \u00b0C. Results align with anecdotal reports from local Departments of Health and from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [24] , who have noted that gatherings of increased risk include outdoor social gatherings such as \"Backyard Barbecues\". One interpretation of this evidence may be that airborne transmission in shared outdoor spaces is feasible on days when the wind is insufficient to disperse viral particles. For example, wind speed in weather outside of the 16-28 \u00b0C temperate zone may make social activities less pleasant or may increase the risk of transmission in outdoor settings with stale air.",

Understanding the geographical distribution of cases resulting on wind-less compared to similar windy days may help determine other factors, such as population density or housing density, that modify impact of reduced wind speed. Additionally, multilevel analyses might examine the extent to which social activities might be affected most by reduced wind speed. Yet, while geographic targets are critical, further research is also needed to determine the extent to which reduced wind speed is more, or less, impactful with novel COVID variants or with other respiratory diseases.

Although there is little reason to think that shared indoor spaces would increase on days of lower wind speed in the 16-28 \u00b0C temperature range, we cannot conclusively state that higher wind speed protected any individuals. Our results were strongly influenced by covariates as evidenced by the change in IRR observed in unadjusted versus adjusted models; it is always possible that key confounders were missing from our model. For example, we could not address the potential for non-independence that may emerge when individuals who have previously survived COVID-19 may be re-infected. However, sensitivity analyses examining the percent change of new cases on a given day relative to the eight-day backward/forward average case count attempted to address temporal changes in incidence patterns directly within the outcome variable, and our results were similar.

Notably, this choice may mean that cutoffs used here may not apply in other situations. More analysis is necessary if weather data are going to be relied upon to help understand caseload in other areas. We reported a nine-day exposure-test positive reporting lag structure; however, sensitivity analyses suggested that a 16-day lag structure may work better. The 16-day lag is outside of the expected lag period for cases in our area. Still, we felt that it might indicate that case dynamics could proceed from asymptomatic younger individuals to cause secondary cases in older individuals reported 16 days later.

Instead, this study may suggest that individuals socializing outdoors may not be completely safe by being outdoors and should remain vigilant, especially on days where airborne particles may be less likely to disperse due to contextual factors such as reduced wind speed, that may reduce the benefits of socializing outside.
