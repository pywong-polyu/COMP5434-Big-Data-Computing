Fondo Maria is an abortion accompaniment fund that provides informational, logistical, financial, and emotional support to people seeking abortion care in Mexico. This cross-sectional study examines the factors that influenced decisionmaking and contributed to delays in accessing care and explores experiences with Fondo Maria's support among women living outside Mexico City (CDMX). We describe and compare the experiences of women across the sample (n = 103) who were either supported by Fondo Maria to travel to CDMX to obtain an abortion (n = 60), or self-managed a medical abortion in their home state (n = 43). Data were collected between January 2017 and July 2018. Seventy-seven percent of participants reported that it was difficult to access abortion care in their home state and 34% of participants indicated they were delayed in accessing care, primarily due to a lack of financial support. The majority of participants (58%) who travelled to CDMX for their abortion did so because it seemed safer. The money/cost of the trip was the most commonly cited reason (33%) why participants who self-managed stayed in their home state. Eighty-seven percent of participants said Fondo Maria's services met or exceeded their expectations. Our data suggest that people seeking abortion and living outside CDMX face multiple and overlapping barriers that can delay care-seeking and influence decisionmaking. Abortion accompaniment networks, such as Fondo Maria, offer a well-received model of support for people seeking abortion in restrictive states across Mexico.",

            "text": "In April 2007, lawmakers in Mexico City (CDMX) passed legislation that decriminalised abortion in the first trimester of pregnancy within the jurisdiction. 1 Recently, legislators in Oaxaca and Hidalgo and the Supreme Court of Mexico voted to decriminalise abortion, but substantial obstacles to implementation remain. 2, 3 Prior to these legal changes, abortion was highly restricted outside of CDMX. 2 In 2018, rape was the only circumstance for which abortion was legal in all 31 states outside of CDMX. 4, 5 Twenty-three states allowed abortion when the life of a woman* was at risk, 15 in the case of severe fetal malformations, and 15 when the health of the woman was at risk. 4, 5 Even when women living outside of CDMX have pregnancies that fall under the legal circumstances permitting abortion in their state, they may be unable to access a legal abortion locally due to a lack of information, restrictive legal interpretations, a lack of willing providers, and a limited history of affirming jurisprudence. 6 As such, people in Mexico, particularly those who live outside of CDMX, continue to face a number of barriers that limit their access to abortion services. Barriers include the financial and logistical burdens of travelling to CDMX, which have the greatest impact on women with less formal education, unmarried women, and women who live further from the capital. 7 Abortion stigma, which contributes to and perpetuates a culture of silence around abortion, may also act as a barrier to care. [3] [4] [5] In Mexico specifically, research has documented widespread stigmatising attitudes towards abortion irrespective of legality. 8, 9 Research has also identified partner or family member opposition as a barrier to obtaining care, particularly for those living outside of CDMX, where stigmatising attitudes appear to be more prevalent. 7, 10 In this context, services that are personcentred, support self-care, empower people to make autonomous decisions, and offer practical support to help people overcome barriers, may improve access to safe, high-quality abortion inside or outside of the formal sector. 11 In Mexico, as well as in other restrictive contexts globally, community-oriented feminist organisations committed to defending and promoting sexual and reproductive rights have pioneered offering such services, using a model of abortion support referred to as abortion accompaniment. 12, 13 Using the accompaniment model, these organisations provide support and evidence-based information, and often help people to safely access and use medications for abortion outside of the formal health sector. 12, 14 Accompaniment organisations differ in the methods they use to connect with people seeking abortions (phone, text, inperson) and the types of support they provide (e.g. financial, logistical, emotional, etc.), but they share the common goals of decreasing barriers to safe abortion services, empowering individuals with the information and support they need to make informed decisions, and ultimately realising their choices.",

That said, in accordance with clinical guidelines, 16 callers beyond 10 weeks of pregnancy are only offered the option to travel to CDMX. Once callers have made a decision, Fondo Maria supports them to make plans to travel or self-manage. They offer those who travel the option of being accompanied to the abortion clinic in CDMX and provide those who stay in their home state with the option to receive support and information over the phone or via textmessage throughout the medical abortion process. To the extent possible, Fondo Maria also offers financial support based on the specific needs of their caller, which may include support to cover the costs of the procedure, travel, medications, accommodations, and food. Between May 2009 and May 2020, Fondo Maria helped over 10,500 people in Mexico access abortion services.",

Fondo Maria counsellors provided study information to all callers when they first contacted the hotline. Callers who expressed interest in participating were transferred to a study administrator before receiving accompaniment support. The study administrator described the study, answered questions, obtained informed consent to both collect baseline data (including sociodemographic data routinely collected by Fondo Maria staff) and contact participants to complete follow-up surveys one and six months after the baseline survey. The study administrator completed the consent process and administered the baseline survey via telephone and the caller was reconnected with a counsellor to receive accompaniment support. Because the baseline survey was administered before participants received accompaniment support, women had not yet made the decision to travel to CDMX or stay in their home state at the time that they completed the baseline survey. Thus, participants were categorised as having either travelled to seek an abortion at one of seven clinics in CDMX with the support of Fondo Maria (FM Clinic) or having been supported by Fondo Maria to self-manage a medical abortion in their home state (FM State), based on records kept by Fondo Maria staff which were linked to surveys through the participant's study ID prior to the administration of the midline survey.",

            "text": "This analysis provides insight into the contexts in which women sought abortion, the factors that influenced decision-making and delays, and experiences with the abortion accompaniment model of care among women living in restrictive abortion settings in Mexico. The majority of women in this study perceived abortion to be very difficult to access in their home state and their experiences and choices were influenced by costs associated with obtaining abortion, a lack of time, perceptions about the safety of medical abortion outside of the clinic setting, and worries about disclosure. Participants had positive experiences with Fondo Maria, adding to the existing evidence that abortion accompaniment is a wellreceived model of support for people seeking care in contexts with limited availability of legal abortion services. 18, 26, 33, 34 The factors that women cited as influencing their choices, contributing to delays, and shaping their experiences with travel demonstrate the types of obstacles that women living outside of CDMX face to obtaining abortion care. In exploring these factors, it is important to note that we collected data on factors influencing decisions and delays at the midline survey only, one month after participants had their abortion. We did not ask questions about how Fondo Maria's support may have shifted participants' experiences and calculations or how it may have helped participants overcome barriers to care. As such, it is challenging to tease apart whether the barriers that emerged in the data represent participants' baseline needs, or obstacles that remained even with Fondo Maria's accompaniment support. That said, regardless of whether they represent baseline needs or persistent obstacles, these barriers provide important insights into the environment people outside of CDMX navigate to seek abortion care. These insights will be instructive for accompaniment networks and other organisations who seek to offer services and design interventions to increase access to options for safe abortion in Mexico.",

While Fondo [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] They also highlight the importance of making additional investments into accompaniment organisations to enable them to provide more financial support or remote support when travel costs remain a barrier. That said, a majority of participants who did not get an abortion as early as they wanted to, reported that financial support would have helped them obtain care earlier.

            "text": "Note: Participants could select more than one option, percentages may add to more than 100% close to the legal limit. Given that all participants received their abortion shortly after taking the baseline survey, this data point likely reflects participants' levels of financial support prior to working with Fondo Maria, showing that, despite the financial barriers, all participants were ultimately able to get the care they wanted with the support of Fondo Maria. Future research could explore the extent to which Fondo Maria's financial support enables people to access abortion services which they might otherwise find to be inaccessible and/or explore how to further reduce delays, which may be particularly important for those who wish to travel to CDMX and risk presenting past the legal limit. 41 A number of participants made choices about their abortion experience based on concerns about the relative safety and effectiveness of clinic-based care compared to self-management. Approximately 75% of the participants who travelled to CDMX for their abortion did so primarily because they thought it was safer, or because they did not know how to use the medications or did not trust that the medications would work. These findings may indicate that, though some people might have a preference for one procedure or another for personal reasons, fears or scepticism about the safety and effectiveness of medical abortion broadly, and self-management specifically, may persist despite Fondo Maria's efforts to provide clear and accurate information to people seeking an abortion. 21, 24, 25, [42] [43] [44] [45] These data align with findings from recently published qualitative studies of women seeking abortion care in Mexico, 46, 47 which have documented that the legality associated with clinic-based abortion care may make it feel safer for participants from both a clinical and legal standpoint. It is critical for people to have improved information about and access to all forms of care, but broader dissemination of reliable and accurate information about medical abortion by organisations like Fondo Maria may enable more people to make fully informed choices based on individual preference and circumstance. This could potentially allow people to circumvent other barriers like cost and time associated with travel if self-management is right for them. Reliable information about and access to home-based self-care may be particularly important given the recent restrictions imposed on movement and a potential preference to avoid travel during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. 48 Our findings also highlight the role fear of disclosure and a desire for secrecy can play in influencing women's decision-making processes and delaying access to care, particularly among women in the FM State group. Preferring to have an abortion at home was the third most commonly cited reason for self-managing an abortion at home, followed by being worried someone would find out. For some in the FM Clinic group, this fear made travelling to CDMX more burdensome. These worries may be linked to abortion stigma, which, in addition to creating barriers to care, may influence the decisions people make about their pregnancies and abortions including whether they carry an unwanted pregnancy to term, what methods they use to terminate their pregnancy, and who they tell and rely on for support. [49] [50] [51] Previous evidence has found that the desire for privacy, comfort, and autonomy motivates people to self-manage their abortion. [52] [53] [54] Taken together, our results point to the barriers that remain for people seeking abortion care in Mexico, even with the support of organisations like Fondo Maria. Recent judicial and legislative shifts suggest that more widespread access to abortion care may be on the horizon, but issues related to provider/facility objection and bringing national and state-wide laws into alignment raise questions about how sweeping this shift will be. 3 In the meantime, a need for the type of services Fondo Maria provides persists and as legislators and activists work to translate the decriminalisation of abortion in the first trimester into practice, particular attention must be paid to building a coordinated ecosystem in which laws, policies, organisations, and communities support people in seeking and obtaining abortion care and decreasing barriers to care. Such an ecosystem must support people to access the type of care they wantwhether that is a clinic or self-managed at home. Organisations, advocates, and policymakers should look to organisations like Fondo Maria who have prioritiesd supportive feminist principles in accompanying people to seek abortion.",

A recent comparative analysis of women who sought abortions in CMDX found that those who had travelled to CDMX from outside the city were better educated on average than both CDMX locals who sought services and residents of their own communities. 55 Additional evidence shows that those travelling to CDMX for legal abortion services travelled from less marginalised municipalities. 56 When compared to the sample of travellers presented in this paper and overall statistics on women seeking abortions in Mexico, our participants appeared to have even higher educational attainment, and a larger proportion was single and nulliparous. 55, 57 These sociodemographic findings suggest that those who call Fondo Maria for support may have more access to information, time, and resources than other people seeking abortion in Mexico. It is thus possible that the types of barriers encountered by women in our sample may have an even greater impact on women who do not access Fondo Maria's services. In light of these findings, Fondo Maria and other accompaniment networks may want to explore strategies to increase awareness about the services they offer to reach a wider range of people in Mexico, some of whom may be in the greatest need of their support.",

[58] [59] [60] Additionally, prior research has noted the limitations of commonly used measures of satisfaction, positing that high levels of satisfaction among abortion clients may be more linked to the achievement of the desired outcome of pregnancy termination 60-62 rather than an evaluation of the service provision. That said, as part of our larger study, we recruited a sub-sample of participants who travelled to CDMX without Fondo Maria's support (data for this group is not included in this analysis), and participants from this group reported that greater emotional support may have helped them obtain abortion care earlier at a higher rate than participants in both FM groups. 63 This suggests that Fondo Maria's services may meet a particular need among individuals seeking abortions, and may help people get the care they want when they want it. Further research should incorporate nuanced explorations of users' experiences with accompaniment services to provide additional insights about their experiences.",

Additionally, the response rate for the midline survey was lower for the FM State group than for the FM Clinic group, and fairly low overall. As such, our sample may not be representative of all people who obtained support from Fondo Maria, particularly those who stayed in their home state or had lower educational attainment or were older. Likewise, the sociodemographic profile of included participants suggests that our sample may not be representative of all people in Mexico seeking abortions. Our sample also only includes women who were ultimately able to access abortion care. Our data do not account for the experiences of, or the barriers faced by, people living outside CDMX who needed abortions but were ultimately unable to obtain them.",

Similarly, we cannot know if participants who got care when they wanted it were able to do so because of Fondo Maria's services, or if participants who said their travel was easy would attribute the ease of their experience to Fondo Maria's support. Further research is needed to explicitly explore abortion-seekers' baseline needs and document the role that accompaniment networks like Fondo Maria play in meeting them. Despite these limitations, our findings provide novel insight into the experiences of women from restrictive contexts in Mexico who sought abortion with accompaniment support, and also uniquely allow us to consider the distinct experiences of those who travel for clinic-based care and those who self-manage locally.",

They centre the individual circumstances of each person seeking an abortion in their support services. In doing this work in this way, Fondo Maria and other accompaniment organisations connect individuals to safe care and important information and also contribute to a growing movement in abortion care that seeks to centre the needs and autonomy of people seeking care and provide services in empowering, supportive settings that meet people where they are. Such an approach has positive implications for the safety and accessibility of abortion services, and the experiences of those seeking care. 64, 65 Increasing the visibility and accessibility of accompaniment organisations like Fondo Maria may enable more people to access safe services in a timely manner, make choices based on individual preference, navigate financial and logistical burdens, and help even more people get the abortions they need. However, even with organisations like Fondo Maria, barriers remain for people seeking abortion care in Mexico. Looking forward, it is critical that the perspectives and needs of people seeking abortion guide efforts to implement the decriminalisation of abortion to ensure that existing barriers to care are addressed and compassionate, person-centred care is available to all people.",

El Fondo MARIA es un fondo de acompa\u00f1amiento durante el aborto que brinda apoyo informativo, log\u00edstico, financiero y emocional a las personas que buscan servicios de aborto en M\u00e9xico. Este estudio transversal examina los factores que influyeron en la toma de decisiones y contribuyeron a retrasos en acceder a los servicios, y explora las experiencias de mujeres que viven fuera de la Ciudad de M\u00e9xico (CDMX) con el apoyo brindado por el Fondo MARIA. Describimos y comparamos las experiencias de las mujeres en la muestra (n = 103) que fueron apoyadas por el Fondo MARIA para viajar a CDMX para obtener un aborto (n = 60) o que autogestionaron un aborto con medicamentos en su estado de residencia (n = 43). Se recolectaron datos entre enero de 2017 y julio de 2018. El 77% de las participantes informaron que les result\u00f3 dif\u00edcil acceder a servicios de aborto en su estado de residencia y el 34% de las participantes indicaron que tuvieron retrasos para acceder a los servicios, principalmente por falta de apoyo financiero. La mayor\u00eda de las participantes (58%) que viajaron a CDMX para tener un aborto lo hicieron porque les pareci\u00f3 ser m\u00e1s seguro. El dinero/gasto del viaje fue la raz\u00f3n m\u00e1s citada (33%) por la cual las participantes que autogestionaron el aborto permanecieron en su estado de residencia. El 87% de las participantes dijeron que los servicios del Fondo MARIA cumplieron o superaron sus expectativas. Nuestros datos indican que las personas que buscan servicios de aborto y viven fuera de CDMX enfrentan barreras m\u00faltiples y coincidentes que pueden retrasar la b\u00fasqueda de servicios e influir en la toma de decisiones.
