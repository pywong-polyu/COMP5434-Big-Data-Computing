The designed smart bracelet aids people to navigate life safely by monitoring health signs; and detecting and alerting people when they violate social distancing regulations. In addition, the bracelet communicates with similar bracelets to keep track of recent contacts. Using RFID technology, the bracelet helps in automating access control to premises such as workplaces. All this is achieved while preserving the privacy of the users.",

            "text": "Contact tracing aims to identify potentially infected individuals in a timely fashion to properly treat and isolate the spread of infections. While contact tracing has long been in practice, it has -until recently -been manually performed. Many automated contact tracing protocols have been recently proposed in the literature such Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (PEPP-PT) [1] , Coalition [2] , and the Decentralized Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing (DP-3T) [3] . Compared to other protocols, (DP-3T) has been more successful where privacy is a key concern. In DP-3T, devices regularly broadcast unique and continuously-changing tags. Each device stores both the set of tags it broadcasted and the tags it heard. When a user is tested positive, he/she can voluntarily permit the device to send the tags it broadcasted to a central database that stores all \"infected\" tags. Other devices regularly check and compare the tags they heard against the database. If a match is found, the device alerts the user to take proper measures. The main strength of DP-3T is that no information that can be used to identify the user is collected, hence, providing strict privacy. However, the protocol lacks a mechanism to track duration of exposure when tags change. In this work, The authors would like to express their sincere gratitude to the Deanship of Scientific Research at KFUPM for the immense support provided. Our gratitude is extended to the Technology Advancement and Prototyping Centre (TAPC) at the Dhahran Techno Valley for the technical support and facilities.",

The solution is comprised of a smart bracelets equipped with sensors to monitor the vital signs of its wearer and provide an early warning when abnormal symptoms arise. In addition, the bracelet can detect when another bracelet is physically too close and reminds the user to respect social distancing regulations. The bracelet also listens and stores messages form nearby bracelets which are then used to warn those who had contacted a confirmed COVID-19 patient; in order to take necessary measures such as executing a quarantine. As privacy is a key concern in such applications, we have adopted a fully privacy-preserving approach. Yet, if necessary, the bracelet can also be used by authorities and employers to control access to certain places. Using Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID), the bracelet can be scanned using an electronic reader to determine the users' risk level, and consequently grant or deny him/her access.",

The second issue is the proximity detection and computation of separation distance using RSSI. As RSSI is typically unreliable, machine learning was used to build a model to perform this task. The third is chrachterising couhging and health condition through fusion of sensor data. In addition to presenting exciting research issues, the application demonistrates a well-rounded example of integration between many interrelated technologies, namely IoT, ML, Cloud Computing, RFID, and BLE; working hand-in-hand to deliver a timely and crucial application. The demo includes a functional prototype demonistrating all the described functionalites working toegther to achieve the claimed application. ",

When the risk level of the wearer changes, the module -if permitted by the user -uploads the user's generated tags to the cloud and stores the new risk level on the RFID tag. This module has been implemented using Raspberry Pi as seen in Figure  3 . The software of the module includes multiple threads for various tasks. The software maintains two tables: contacts and tags. The contacts table contains all the heard tags, the time each tag was first heard, and the total exposure time; while the tags table stores the tags sent by the node itself.",

When a user is deemed infected, the tags he used are uploaded to the cloud. Other devices constantly contact the cloud to retreive the list of infected tags and compare them to the locally stored ones. This way, exposure detection is identified by the end devices rather than the cloud which improves privacy.",

Infected tags coming from the same node are linked together. This allows computing the exposure duration across different tags coming from the same bracelet.
