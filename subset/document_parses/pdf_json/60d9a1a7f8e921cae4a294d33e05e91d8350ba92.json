According to the World Health organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), globally, as of 2020, around 1 in 4 people were determined to be lacking access to potable water in their place of residence [2] . Particularly, in Pakistan, an estimated 70% of households drink water contaminated with bacteria [3] . However even in Pakistan, there are differences between rural and urban environments in general and even differences between urban environments themselves. In Karachi for example, data gathered by research officers of the Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources (PCRWR) estimates that up to 91% of drinking water is unsafe to drink [4] . This is in stark contrast to the data collected by the same council in which they found that only 62% of drinking water out of the 29 major cities tested across Pakistan to be unfit for consumption [5] . Furthermore, there are differences in respect to time and in this case an unfortunate one, as a current primary concern is the increased contamination of water through the years. This is evidenced by PCRWR reports conducted in 2015-2016 which find that only 57% of water samples in major cities were contaminated [5] .",

For example, in Pakistan, about 50% of all diseases and 40% of deaths occur due to poor quality of drinking water [6] . Secondly, the leading cause of death in infants and children is diarrhea, a waterborne disease. The root cause of waterborne diseases is water with the addition of municipal sewage and industrial waste at various sections of the water distribution network. This coupled with the inefficient and sometimes nonexistent water disinfection and water quality checks at treatment plants [6] are major contributing factors to the high rates of water contamination. Given the circumstances of the pandemic, prior sanitation issues, and the lack of adequate research, it is imperative to address the health impacts of the deteriorating environmental conditions. This is especially so within the context of Karachi where the growing population needs and governmental dysfunction at the municipal level is expected to worsen the already pre-existing health burdens. Therefore, this article's aim is to bring awareness to the present issues regarding the poor sanitation standard and practices in Karachi, Pakistan, as well as the current efforts surrounding water sanitation and lastly identify challenges with corresponding recommendations to tackle the issues.",

Moreover, this gap is expected to grow along with the city's growing population, and to meet the increasing demand many illegal water hydrants have been installed across the city. KWSB officials report these illegal hydrants have led to theft of 30 million gallons of water along with revenue losses of around Rs 1.3 billion annually [8] . To make matters worse, some KWSB officials have been criticized for taking bribes and underreporting many of the illegal hydrants which has masked the true economic impacts of such theft [9] .",

In addition to chemical contaminants, high levels of Escherichia coli (E.coli) were found in Karachi's water sources and the city's water was labelled as the most contaminated water in all of Sindh by Pakistan Council of Research in Water Resources' (PCRWR) research teams [12] . This excessive contamination of groundwater means it requires treatment before it is safe for consumption and yet only 62% households receive water with any prior treatment while 1.91 of the 2.16 million cubic meters (mcm) of wastewater remains untreated on a daily basis [10] . Furthermore, many residents have complained that the water tastes salty or looks cloudy and have often found insects crawling in it.

There has been a recent surge in extensive drug-resistant typhoid cases and overcrowded slums with poor sanitation infrastructure prove to be ideal breeding grounds for these microorganisms [14] . The situation is further complicated by the spread of COVID-19, which presents with symptoms similar to typhoid fever, making differential diagnosis difficult [15] . As previously stated, Karachi's water is highly contaminated with E. coli which increases the prevalence of diarrhea. This along with high figures of open defecation (25 million) in Pakistan further contaminate the water [16] . Open defecation could further accelerate the spread of diseases like rotavirus and Helicobacter pylori, both of which are transmitted by direct or indirect contact with an infected person's feces [17, 18] . Lastly, diseases like malaria and dengue can also spread through contaminated water as the vectors for these diseases, Anopheles and the Aedes mosquitos respectively, breed in pools of stagnant water [19, 20] . Overall these water-borne diseases exert a significant burden on the city's healthcare system and urgent efforts must be made to improve the sanitation services in Karachi.",
