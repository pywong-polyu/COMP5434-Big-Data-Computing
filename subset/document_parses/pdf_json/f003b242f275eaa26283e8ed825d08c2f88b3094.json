Due to the fact that a small proportion of gamblers develop problems, responsible gambling (RG), player protection, and harm minimization have become core areas for gambling regulators. The present study replicated a previous one carried out by Bonello and Griffiths in 2017 to determine whether there had been any significant changes by leading gambling operators due to increased regulatory pressures over the past few years. Fifty leading online gambling operators were audited in relation to their RG practices as well as engaging with their customer services by posing as a problem gambler. Results indicated that overall RG practices appeared to have improved in the past 3 years based on the information in dedicated RG webpages, the increase in RG tool availability, and the communication with customer services. Despite the fact that RG practices appear to have improved, there were still areas for improvement.",

Gambling regulation is usually centered around the possible risks associated with gambling and with the main role being consumer protection (Villeneuve & Meyer, 2010) . Despite this, in some jurisdictions such as Malta, online gambling may be more viewed as an economic issue rather than around its potentiality of being a health problem (Marinaci et al., 2019) . Online gambling has gone through an overhaul in terms of consumer protection in the past 5 years due to an increasing amount of countries regulating online gambling and in turn enforcing consumer protection measures. It is one thing to have such regulations in place, but it is another to have them in practice. In fact, such discrepancies have resulted in penalties and in a few instances gambling licenses being revoked. For instance, in 2018, the UK Gambling Commission threatened to revoke five online gambling operator licenses due to failures in consumer protection in the prevention of anti-money laundering and consumer interactions (Kott, 2020a) .",

Here, operators are obliged to not only inform consumers about gambling risks but also take a proactive role in helping individuals to moderate their gambling consumption (Kashina, 2020a) . Denmark updated their secondary gambling legislation so to increase consumer protection to continue enforcing RG practices (Kott, 2020b) . On the first day of 2019, a new licensing regime was introduced for Swedish operators that included RG measures such as RG-related messaging when the consumer accesses their gambling account, along with information about RG tools, and their accrued total financial losses for the previous year (Kott, 2020c) . Spelinspektionen (the Swedish gambling regulator) followed on the footsteps of the UK Gambling Commission and introduced financial penalties for operators failing RG measures, as well as having the power to revoke gambling licenses (Altaner, 2020) . This increased RG focus has also had its effect on the Maltese regulator where new regulations were proposed in 2018 which included an increase in RG messaging to its consumers (Kashina, 2020b) .",

            "text": "In order to better understand gambling operators' practices, researchers have attempted to explore this practice through descriptive studies. Smeaton and Griffiths (2004) were the first to do this by examining the RG practices of 30 online gambling websites based in the UK. It was evident that more attention was needed in this area as there was a lack of RG initiatives at the time (Blaszczynski et al., 2004) . Smeaton and Griffiths reported that 23 out of the 30 examined operators had no reference to responsible gambling, and 26 out of the 30 operators did not have a reference or referral to a gambling help organization. This lack of RG commitment was further reflected by the fact that only one of the operators examined had an option to self-exclude. Marionneau and Jarvinen-Tassopoulos (2017) carried out a similar study of French online gambling operators where it was noted that RG tools were not always easy to use, and information about RG was not on the same platform that was used to gamble on. However, it was noted that every licensed website examined conformed to all the RG obligations placed by the law, including having a warning banner, an option to self-exclude, an option to set up limits, and information based on the consumer's account history. Bonello and Griffiths (2017) evaluated the 50 most advertised gambling operators in Malta to understand the different consumer protection practices available to gambling consumers. Their study showed that the majority of operators had an RG page, but most of these pages contained commercial information on this page. Most operators offered the possibility to set limits and to self-exclude. Cooney et al. (2021) evaluated online gambling operators based in Ireland (replicating the study by Bonello and Griffiths [2017] ) and concluded that RG tools were inconsistent. The majority of the operators had an RG page and included links to gambling help organizations. Limits were available across most of the operators, almost half offered session-time reminders, and almost all offered self-exclusion options, through customer service or online application. Consistency across different operators would help as most gamblers use more than one online gambling account (Auer & Griffiths, 2012) , and therefore having consistent RG tools being used by different gambling operators would help in minimizing harm. Moreover, RG tools not only increase customer trust, but also result in less disputes due to gambling issues (Gainsbury et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "There have been a number of reviews concerning the efficacy of responsible gambling tools over the past few years including both general reviews of all RG tools (e.g., Drawson et al., 2017; Harris & Griffiths, 2017; Ladouceur et al., 2017; McMahon et al., 2019; Tanner et al., 2017) and reviews of very specific RG tools such as pop-up messaging (Bj\u00f8rseth et al., 2021) and limit-setting (Delfabbro & King, 2021) . Ladouceur et al. (2017) systematically reviewed all studies that had examined the efficacy of RG tools that had been examined in a real-world gambling environment. The review included 29 studies and primarily covered self-exclusion programs and limit-setting tools with only six studies providing the \"scientific rigor necessary to offer interpretative confidence,\" and the evidence concerning efficacy of RG tools and programs was \"very limited\" (p.233). Harris and Griffiths (2017) examined the efficacy of RG tools that were used by the gambling industry to reduce gambling-related harm (i.e., mandatory play breaks, limit-setting, pop-up messaging, and behavioral tracking tools). They evaluated 20 studies and noted many of the methodological weaknesses of the studies examined. While there appeared to be some efficacy in relation to limit-setting, the efficacy of other RG tools was somewhat limited. Drawson et al. (2017) examined the efficacy of what they described as \"protective behavioral strategies in gambling\" (e.g., monetary limit-setting, time limit-setting, self-exclusion). They reviewed 33 studies and concluded that evidence was best for selfexclusion programs but that the findings across all studies was inconsistent and that there were many methodological limitations that affected the generalizability of the results. The same team carried out a systematic review of gambling industry-implemented harm-minimization strategies . They reviewed 27 studies and concluded that there was some preliminary efficacy among RG tools such as self-appraisal pop-up messages, removal of large-note acceptors on slot machines, and $1 maximum bets. However, the quality of the studies was limited, and there was a reliance on retrospective self-report alongside the lack of adequate control groups. McMahon et al. (2019) carried out a review of systematic reviews and examined 55 studies within 10 systematic reviews examining RG tools such as self-exclusion, personalized messaging, pre-commitment, and limit setting. They concluded that the efficacy of such tools was limited by the extent to which gamblers adhere to voluntary (rather than mandatory) systems. They also claimed that the studies evaluated were \"generally poor\" and \"dominated by evaluations of individual-level harm reduction interventions, with a paucity of research on supply reduction interventions\" (p.380). Bj\u00f8rseth et al. (2021) carried out a meta-analysis examining the efficacy of pop-up messaging in 18 published studies although only three of these were real-world studies with most carried out in laboratory settings. They concluded that pop-up messaging had moderate effects in curtailing gamblers' behavior and that pop-ups are an important part of gambling operators' RG tool portfolio. Delfabbro and King (2021) carried out a systematic review of mandatory and voluntary pre-commitment and limit-setting RG tools. The review examined 25 studies and expressed caution about the potential benefits of limit-setting systems, but some mandatory limit-setting tools appeared to have at least some efficacy.",

Details of the specific RG practices that were investigated are found in the following section. The study examined best international practices regarding RG. Given that many operators provide gambling services to multiple countries, and different countries have different gambling regulations, the authors took the approach of examining what RG tools were utilized by operators rather than trying to determine whether the operator adhered to specific country regulations regarding harm minimization.",

A pseudonym was created for the account, as well as a fictional date of birth and address.

For the second question, the response expected by customer services was that there should be an increase or removal of such limits and resulting in a \"cooling off\" period. If this happened, it was assessed positively. For the final statement, the responses by customer services were categorized as (i) good practice, (ii) terminated account, and (iii) bad practice. Good practice comprised providing assistance, RG information, and information on how to seek help for a gambling problem. Terminated account referred to when the operator did not initiate communication about RG and help-seeking but simply terminated the relationship with the customer without the customer being told anything by the operator.

Most operators (n = 46; 92%) referenced a help group where the consumer may seek help with problem gambling, and 42 had a self-assessment test available (84%). Eight operators used the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI; Ferris & Wynne, 2001 ) as a self-assessment tool, and one operator had adapted the DSM-5 criteria for gambling disorder (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). Four operators offered a link to the Brief Biosocial Gambling Screen (BBGS; Gebauer et al., 2010) . Four operators used the GA-20 Test (Gamblers Anonymous, not dated). Eight operators provided a link to external websites where gamblers could take a self-test. More specifically, four operators provided a link to the UK charity GamCare where the customer was then redirected to a link for the self-assessment test developed by Sustainable Interaction. Three operators provided a direct link to the self-assessment test developed by Sustainable Interaction, and one operator provided a link to Gamblers Anonymous website.

A number of gambling regulators specifically state that any commercial communication must not be directed to known vulnerable individuals such as those who have self-excluded or have let the gambling operator know they have a gambling problem (e.g., Malta Gaming Authority, 2018). This means that the online operator should refrain from sending promotional communication to such consumers, and most of the operators did this (n = 43; 86%).

However, the first author received an email stating that a self-exclusion was placed on the account from all four operators. For the remaining eight operators, the customer service representative did not really answer the question and gave very vague answers such as affirming the statement or confirming that the situation must be difficult. Despite the answers not being ideal, for all these operators, the first author received an email stating that the account would be closed and that a self-exclusion was applied on the account. Bad practice was present for 11 operators (22%). For an operator to fall in this category, the response received to the statement would not be reflective of a responsible gambling operator and meant they did not provide support to an individual who admitted they had a gambling problem. These varied quite a bit. Examples include one operator highlighting that the choice is dependent on the consumer so there is nothing the operator can do. Another operator mentioned that the first author could have a bonus because current times are tough on everyone (supposedly referring to COVID-19 situation), and another customer service representative highlighted that it is only a gambling problem if an individual experienced it all the time and not periodically.",

The presence of an RG page was found for all, but two of the operators examined, and in one case, the RG page was not visible on the main page of the operator, where it is most needed. A notable change from the previous study was the reduction of promotional communication on the RG page. In the 2017 study, only six of the operators (12%) had no promotional communication on their RG page, whereas in this current study, 43 operators had no promotional material on the RG page (86%). Operators have a responsibility to their consumers to prevent gambling-related harm as much as possible (Monaghan, 2009) , and providing a non-commercially inclined RG page is the least the operator may do. This also emphasizes that there is an element of responsible and fair practice by the operator, which is not only in accordance to the regulation and codes of conduct but increases customer retention which in turn aids to a profitable business model (Gainsbury et al., 2013) .",

Having a more comprehensible representation of these RG tools would not only help the consumer refer to the page, but when displaying a positive attitude towards RG, and the tools, will help in normalizing these which will further help more in consumers using them (Procter et al., 2019) . Gambling filtering software helps consumers that might be gambling too much to limit their gambling by reducing accessibility, even on websites that are not locally regulated; therefore, promoting such a tool would also help (Gamban, 2021) .",

Despite this, no operator realized that the account that the first author created did not contain real information; therefore, it might be easy for someone under the legal age to register and play. This can result in a major issue highlighted by Calado et al. (2017) because minors should not be allowed to gamble because gambling during adolescence may not only lead to problem gambling, but also addiction to other things (e.g., psychoactive substances). Similar to the 2017 study, almost all operators sent an email containing commercial information. This is understandable from a business perspective because it might encourage the consumer to play more, but less than half of the operators (42%; n = 21) only sent an email that contained some RG information or at least a link to the RG page. The most worrying aspect was that one operator's link leading to the RG page was to commercial information, which could be either be a mistake or a nonresponsible way of getting gamblers to play more.",

            "text": "Deposit limits are a good way of ensuring that consumers play within their limits, and voluntary deposit limits may encourage less churn and more sustainable revenue with the consumer through loyalty (Auer et al., 2019) . These are also RG tools that appear to have some proven efficacy based on systematic literature reviews (e.g., Delfabbro & King, 2021;  Harris . Although these tools may not be used frequently, their efficacy is still high, and consumers that set these limits gamble at sustainable levels (Gainsbury et al., 2020) . The popularity of these tools may also be due to how the operator promotes such tools. The present study showed that less than half of the operators (40%; n = 20) offered the option to set a limit on the deposit money page, which might also influence how many gamblers use this limit more effectively. Almost all the operators (98%, n = 49) offered RG tools such as limit-setting tools and short periods of taking a break from gambling. Most operators (96%, n = 48) offered the option for the consumer to have a break from gambling by using the self-exclusion tool. RG tools such as limit-setting and self-exclusion appear to be beneficial for the consumer and for the operator and are deemed useful by players (Griffiths et al., 2009) although proven efficacy of self-exclusion schemes is somewhat limited Tanner et al., 2017) . A previous study found that online poker players mentioned that RG tools increase trust in the operator because it shows that the company has integrity (Wood & Griffiths, 2008) . Regular consumers may set voluntary limits to prevent themselves from gambling too much (Hing et al., 2015) . This is beneficial for the operator because it might increase the chance for the consumer never to go overboard and result in a sudden break from gambling. One factor which should be rectified is the offering of RG tools onsite. Five operators did not offer the consumer the option to self-exclude online, and this might not be the best RG approach because it might hinder consumers from taking a much-needed break from gambling.",

By using this methodology, the researchers were able to get a glimpse of the help a consumer would get first-hand from the operator. Although communication appears to have been better than the previous study, improvement is still needed. Online gambling is a very competitive business, and by focusing on consumer loyalty and investment, this would render the business successful (Gainsbury et al., 2013) . Customer service interaction was the factor that differentiated the operators among them and showed which companies were really committed to RG. There may be a number of reasons why specific customer service interactions were not ideal. It could be that the operator is not taking RG that seriously, and therefore consumers highlighting that they might have an issue with gambling is not deemed as important enough to render an intervention. Another possible explanation could be that the customer service representatives were not sufficiently trained in RG, and therefore could not handle the customer contact properly.",

In terms of replication of Bonello and Griffiths' (2017) previous study of the world's top 50 gambling websites, only 32 of these were still in operation at the time of the present study. Therefore, while the methodology was identical, the population sample was somewhat different in the present sample and may have influenced the findings. In relation to evaluating customer service interactions, only one interaction took place and may not necessarily have been representative of all customer services. Future studies should include more than a single interaction. Given that there is still improvement needed by gambling operators in the area of RG, future replication studies are needed along with a larger number of operators. Future research could also investigate whether there are differences in RG tool provision among gambling operators on different regulating jurisdictions. Other studies could also specifically examine how compliant the gambling operators are in relation to the jurisdictional gambling regulations.",
