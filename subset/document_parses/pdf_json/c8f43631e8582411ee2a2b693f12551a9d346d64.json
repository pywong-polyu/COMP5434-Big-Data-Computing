            "text": "It has become a trope to speak of the increasing value of health data in our societies. Such rhetoric is highly performative: it creates expectations, channels and justifies investments in data technologies and infrastructures, and portrays deliberations on political and legal issues as obstacles to the flow of data. Yet, important epistemic and political questions remain unexamined, such as how the value of data is created, what data journeys are envisioned by policies and regulation, and for whom data types are (intended to be) valuable. Drawing on two empirical cases, (a) interviews with physicians on the topic of digital selfcare, and (b) expectations of stakeholders on the use of Real-World Data in clinical trials, as well as existing literature, we propose a typology of what health data help us to do. This typology is intended to foster reflection about the different roles and values that data use unfolds. We conclude by discussing how regulation can better accommodate practices of valuation in the health data domain, with a particular focus on identifying regulatory challenges and opportunities for EU-level policy makers, and how Covid-19 has shed light on new aspects of each case.

While debates about data quality, interoperability, and access may have previously been restricted to largely expert circles, with the pandemic these questions became the topic of prime-time news and trends on social media. For example, Tomas Pueyo's data analytics about the spread of Covid-19 infections piqued the interest of millions in epidemiological research and assessments (Pueyo 2020) . The reading of infection data dashboards and case-load updates became part of many people's daily media consumption. Analyses of geocoded infection and mobility data were debated in relation to questions of whether 'hard lockdowns work' (Heiler et al. 2020) . Models of how airborne particles travel illustrated potential exposure for daily activities such as going to the grocery store (Guarino and Achenbach 2020) . While there were heated debates on-and off-line about how to interpret infection data and about what data are missing, the value of health data never seemed to come into question.",

            "text": "What is health data? How does it become valuable? The EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) defines 'data concerning health' as \"any personal data related to the physical or mental health of a natural person, including the provision of health care services, which reveal information about his or her health status\" (General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 2016, p. Recital 35). This seems to limit the remit of health data to personal data, namely data that is related to an identified or identifiable natural person-excluding anonymous and anonymised data that cannot (or can no longer) be linked to any specific individual (meaning that pseudonymised data are considered personal data and thus within the remit of the GDPR). As Purtova (2018) and others have argued, however, because personal data is not only data that links to an already identified individual person, but also data that could lead to the identification of a specific individual, the remit of personal data is very broad-and extends to IP addresses, mobility data, and consumer data. In addition, the GDPR's formulation that health data is personal data 'related to' the health of people also in the sense that it \"reveal[s] information about her health status\" (GDPR), this makes the remit of health data even wider: It is possible to link almost every dataset with others and discover associations from which health-related characteristics can be inferred-even if the original datasets are not immediately health-relevant (Prainsack, 2017; Prainsack and Van Hoyweghen, 2020) . For example, if seemingly innocuous characteristics such as the purchase of certain types of consumer goods online, or the watching of daytime television, are associated with healthrelevant outcomes, then the initial data on online purchases or the consumption of TV streaming services has become health-relevant as well (Duhigg, 2012) . In this sense, all types of data can yield information that is relevant to health-a fact that regulation does not adequately accommodate.",

The second layer consists of data that was collected in other, not explicitly health-relevant contexts but that is, or can be relevant, to answer a health-relevant question-such as a person's activity tracker data or consumption habits. The third layer is data that may seemingly have nothing to do with health, but that could disclose health relevant information as a byproduct, or if linked with other data-such as holiday pictures, credit card purchases or social media postings (Weber et al. 2014) .

            "text": "In exploring value-creation in the health data domain, we begin our reflections on the notion of value. In a market setting, products and services are valued by consumers and producers and prices are attached accordingly. Of course, not everything that has value has a price (our personal health, for instance), and things with the same price tag can have very different values for different people (the price of a heart implant, for instance). Value is not intrinsic to a specific product or service, but depends on context and relationships (e.g. between provider and user). This turns our attention from value to valuation as a social process that each of us is deeply involved with in a variety of settings. Different subfields of sociology are engaged with studying the basic social process of valuation and evaluation-from cultural and economic sociology, to inequality studies and sociology of science (see also Layer 1: data created in the process of clinical or other healthcare settings to answer questions with explicit health relevance Layer 2: data created in contexts that are not explicitly health relevant that were analyzed to answer an explicitly healthrelevant question Layer 3: behavioural and other data that have no immediate health relevance but that can disclose health-relevant information \"as a by-product\" Lamont (2012) . Building on Lamont, Helgesson and Muniesa outlined a research programme for 'valuation studies' that understand value as a social construct-not in the sense that value would only be the outcome of shared belief, but of organised social work aimed at making things valuable (2013, p. 6) . The result of this organised social work in some cases can be the objectification of a given value, one that is materially consequential albeit historically contingent (Mitchell and Waldby 2010) .",

Whether at the policy level, in public administration, in many realms of economic activity, or in scientific activity, different actors have a range of expectations about how value is drawn from data. This ranges from the 'data as oil' metaphor to more sector-specific discussions in manufacturing or health. According to Wilson and colleagues, one important element in determining the value of a specific dataset is the purpose for which it can and will be used. The value of data is also always influenced by relational factors (Wilson et al. 2020) : not only because the value of a dataset can be influenced by who curated or collected it (e.g., because the data curator is known to be particularly rigorous, or because data from particular data sources or subjects are difficult to obtain), but also because different actors value the same dataset differently. Sometimes the same actors attach different types of value to the same dataset, e.g. financial value and personal value. A patient might value his or her health monitoring data as a reassurance of a current health status. He or she might also value it financially if offered an opportunity to do so. It is also for this reason that value is not completely separable from the process of valuation: Rather than being the result of valuation, different types of value serve as reference points for the practice of making something valuable.",

In the online space, the data that individuals provide through their social media activity can become the main assets of companies' data infrastructures (Tempini 2017) . In politics and public administration, certain actors can derive value from the mere (and repeated) call for more data (Hoeyer 2019) . In the realm of science, powerful analytical tools might indeed be available to create value (financial, epistemic, etc.) out of large amounts of data available to academic actors-the problem is moving the data around. This requires solutions to a number of social, ethical and semantic challenges (Leonelli 2019) , and these solutions are not always available to all. Work is required to draw value from data, and the capacity to carry out this work (curate large amounts of data, hold data in storage infrastructure, sell data in the right form at the right time, etc.) is unevenly spread.",

In order to enable both communities to benefit from the data (and to draw financial value from it for the company's purposes), the conflicting demands of sufficient patient engagement (necessary to get data at scale) and sufficient semantic context (to achieve a suitable degree of specificity in the data) need to be balanced. Other authors have focused on various forms of 'data work' necessary to produce and, ultimately, to draw value from data in healthcare and related fields (Fiske et al., 2019a (Fiske et al., , 2019b Medical scribes, a profession dedicated to clinical documentation alongside physicians, collect data that is imported into electronic health records (Bossen et al. 2019 ); data curators package 'small facts', physical traces left by experimental apparatuses, for data journeys (Leonelli 2010) ; researchers invest in long-term care relationships with their data (Pinel et al. 2020) .

Such a systematic overview is also necessary if we seek to reform regulation to better fit data use in the digital era. In reflecting on the Covid-19 pandemic, and increasing calls for the need for 'more' data, or the inherent value of data in devising appropriate public health responses, we argue it is productive to shift the focus away from generalised notions of data that are considered sensitive or not, or data that can 'facilitate research' or 'improve healthcare' to instead consider data in terms of roles and uses, within a suite of relationships and practices that can, in turn, affect value. We move towards this shift in approach through the creation of a typology of the roles of health data, which we have inductively derived from two empirical case studies conducted by the authors, and is informed by the above literature on value and health data. Our intention is to focus on what is actually being done by and with health data: the roles it plays, the forms of value it creates, and for whom. This focus has specific relevance for examining the role of health data in regulation, in unfolding crises such as the pandemic, and can be expanded for considering the shifting uses and applications of health data in society.",

Following this, each author discussed coding results, and refined sub-themes to ensure a high degree of inter-coder reliability, with the aim of identifying different roles that data play in health research and medical practice, and extrapolating different types of value that they yield. All four authors met repeatedly to generate and consolidate the roles that they had drawn from their data to create a typology. Specific attention was paid to the use of health data during the Covid-19 pandemic, between the period of January 2020-April 2021. This included reflections drawn from the involvement of two of the authors (BP and AF) in a longitudinal, qualitative 9-country study on the pandemic (\"Solidarity in times of a pandemic, SolPan\"), as well as literature review.

These data can be interpreted in relation to changes over time, correlations or in relation to other data-based criteria. Further, partly due to the greater availability of digital tools and molecular technologies, ever wider aspects of people's bodies and behaviors become observable and are being datafied (i.e. captured in digital data). This process yields larger amounts of health data that clinicians or researchers can interpret. Patients themselves also use the data gained from empirical observation for self-oriented sense-making affecting their interpretation of a situation. This happens, for example, when a pregnant woman entering fetal movements into an app considers the app part of her sensory instruments. Bodily observations, whether collected through analog observations or digital tools, can also influence personal or clinical decisions, and contribute to meaningmaking around one's health and body. As Weiner et al. (2020) have shown, close attention to how data is, or is not recorded, can provide insight into how self-monitoring data flows (or does not flow) to big data sets. For example, a patient trying to eat a specific diet may remember what she ate in the last two or three days, but certainly not a few months ago; if she did not keep a diet journal there would be no way to access this information. The same patient using a diet app where she uploads pictures of everything she eats and enters the approximate size (or calorie count) creates a dataset that is available for interpretation for a long time, both for her personal use and, theoretically, for others as well. The resulting data can be useful on multiple levels, for the person herself, for their care providers, or within the context of a larger data set for a researcher or a company interested in deriving user insights. Physicians in the DSC study echoed this idea, noting that self-tracking devices could encourage self-observation, which may be personally valuable for patients in managing their health. We also observe this trend of datafication facilitating observation and interpretation in the context of Covid-19, e.g. with regard to self-testing: a new type of health data becomes individually and socially meaningful when the SARS-CoV-2 infection status is relevant knowledge for participation in public life.",

Medical research and practice have always been about classifying. In its most basic form, different types of health data are used to classify individuals as sick or healthy. Patients are routinely classified, whether on the basis of their disease ('diabetic'), their probability for developing a particular disease ('at risk'), or on the basis of specific health traits ('obese'). Patients are also clustered by type of disease or risk factor, and these relationships are often further quantified in relation to biomarkers. For example, in the DSC study, one physician illustrated this point by referring to a digital programme used to determine eligibility for a particular kind of surgery. Patients were asked to input information about their weight and activity over the course of months into an app, in order to inform the decision taken with doctors on whether or not they would be a good candidate for the surgery. In the RWD study, it was pointed out by interviewees that routine health data collected for administrative purposes (e.g. ICD-10 disease classification codes used documented for reimbursement purposes) can help to identify (classify) suitable subjects for clinical studies. In the Covid-19 context, data is used to quantify viral load and classify SARS-CoV-2 infection status. In a research context, several thousands of Covid-19 patients logged their symptoms daily in an app (Sudre et al. 2020) with the goal of enabling the discovery of associations between symptoms that were previously not linked to Covid-19. Similarly, data mining exercises have been able to detect associations between comorbidities that have led to a reassessment of patient risk (Bhavnani et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2020) or an investigation of the underlying causal pathways ). This, in turn, could change the classification of some diseases, and also shed new light on quantitative distributions.",

But data can also generate hypotheses, e.g. in the context of inductive data mining. As the RWD study showed, real-world data from administrative healthcare processes or from publicly held disease registries can help to develop hypotheses on disease pathways or comorbidities. As the data quality in these registers is often limited (e.g. because of a lack of resources for data cleaning) or affected by bias (e.g. because data are collected for accounting, not for medical documentation), the use of these data for hypothesis testing is more challenging. Despite the excitement about RWD, the experts interviewed considered that hypothesis testing requires particular efforts in terms of data quality and will continue to rely heavily on controlled experimental environments.",

This could form a hypothesis that could be investigated with other data. For example, the German Cancer Society's Infinity idea (Rachel et al. 2021; Deutsche Krebsgesellschaft 2019) shows what a process of hypothesis generation and testing might look like. Oncological knowledge oriented to the needs of patients is created when findings from care generate new research ideas and hypotheses.

Data sets can be automatically updated, for example, to include the most recent pharmacological information on drug interactions or available medications, as well as for different forms of cross-referencing.

For example, in the DSC study, one participant explained that the use of an app for migraine symptoms resulted in a much more streamlined process of patients reporting when they took medications at the onset of symptoms. This, the doctor said, was much better compared to analogue modes of logging which patients often left at home or did not have with them when symptoms began. In the Covid-19 context, we have seen data-driven automation in triage algorithms and symptom testing, contact tracing as well as the use of machine learning approaches to image analysis (e.g. of lung CT scans; see Lai et al. 2020 ).",

As one physician in the DSC study noted, doctors have long been viewed as \"Gods in White\" in Germany, whose expertise was largely beyond the reproach of patients (DSC Interview 4). One way in which such hierarchies are shifting is with regard to healthcare data, which historically was strictly within the realm of the professional. A power shift to the patient was also indicated by an interviewee in the RWD case study. The interviewee argued that patients will be empowered in their relationship with the \"Gods in White\" if they know more about the performance of the medication they are prescribed (Interview A).",

While such instances can increase the knowledge and agency of patients (leading to possible empowerment), there are other instances where data disempowers patients-for example when they are faced with data that may or may not say something important about their health but that they cannot interpret themselves (and may need to pay for help in interpreting). For example, one geneticist in the DSC study brought up the case of non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). In Germany, the companies who conduct NIPT will only do so upon request by a physician. The results are then returned to the physician, not the patient, and are generally not covered by insurance.

Data biases can also reflect human biases, such as sexist or racial stereotypes: For example, women, or people of color, are less likely to receive a diagnosis because their pain is dismissed as a cultural or gender-specific expression despite showing the same symptoms as white men.

As health data is personal and sensitive (generally speaking, as well as particularly within the GDPR in the EU), it is generated in controlled environments with ethical and legal frameworks in place, e.g. regarding consent for primary or secondary use. In clinical research, for instance, an established practice of data collection is through clinical trials, very often in the form of randomised controlled trials (RCTs). There are occasions, however, where RCTs are not possible, e.g., due to lack of resources. Sometimes, an RCT might be unethical, or it might be impossible to find enough study participants. In these cases, using data from outside RCTs might serve as a proxy. One example would be the construction of a historical or so-called virtual control group out of routinely collected health data (administrative data or medical record data). This is an example of proxying. For example, in the RWD study, a respondent noted that as personalised medicine becomes more advanced, resulting in ever smaller case groups, eventually it will not be possible to complete an RCT because there are not enough patients with a particular subgroup of, for example, lung cancer (Interview C). Other examples in this vein include in silico medicine, systems medicine, virtual datasets, and projects creating data doubles for sharing, such as the Human Brain Project (https:// www. human brain proje ct. eu/ en/) or in education such as the Visible Human Project (Waldby 1997) .",

The basic problem is that measurements cannot be made deep in the lungs of sick patients, where ventilator-induced damage occurs. Doctors use their experience to adjust the ventilator optimally for the patient, since there is no measured value for this. Scientists at the Technical University of Munich created an anatomically-functional digital twin of the lung from individual CT scans and lung function measurements. Instead of relying purely on machine learning, they used a complex, model-based approach that is backed not only by CT images of the lungs but also by large amounts of physical knowledge. In this combination, diseased lungs can be realistically simulated, and proxy data used to inform improved clinical care. Agent-based simulation models also try to create digital twins of real humans and their behavior in order to model epidemiological dynamics (Cuevas 2020) . In simulation models, digital twins or virtual study arms, the practice of proxying enables experiments or interventions that would otherwise not be possible.",

It also can be useful for particular populations, such as children managing a chronic disease like diabetes for whom routine doctors' visits disrupts school attendance and increases the social burden of their health-as was noted by several participants in the DSC study. Similarly, patient-collected data, e.g. on lifestyle or health registry data, can make the process of identifying possible participants in a clinical study more efficient, reducing the cost of clinical research. The digitisation of processes in health care (hospital patient management, inter-professional communication, etc.) is another example where digital health data is perceived as valuable, because it enables a more efficient service delivery. As one interviewee noted in the RWD study, the increasing availability of data on patients is leading to more targeted and those more efficient clinical trials: \"Because the more patients you have and the more knowledge you have about them, you can actually screen them before you even try to send them to a clinical trial.\" Routine data from registers, but also health data collected through patient-facing apps can be helpful, such as in the targeted recruitment of patients for phase IV clinical trials (Interview A).",

In the DSC study, one doctor noted that one of their principal concerns with the increasing availability of digital tools and on-line, direct-to-consumer testing options, was that it was motivated by financial profit and not by medical benefit: \"I'm personally quite skeptical of sending things off to somewhere where you pay privately.

It can also take place in an academic environment where actors might get access to resources (research project participation, infrastructure access, etc.) due to the possibility of future data access or exploitation. As Hoeyer (2019) has shown, certain political actors also derive value from data by stating that more data is required in the future (such as to solve certain problems, or to address specific issues). In the RWD study, an example for the aspirational value of data was seen in the prospect of a well-documented oncological treatment, including investments in documentation and data quality control, which played a part in a reform of the institutional setup of cancer care in an Austrian region (Interview D). Better oncological data was expected to improve clinical practice, which led to institutional investments and organisational reform.",

Very often, the availability of different kinds of data leads to deliberation, or reflection on what changes are necessary-whether in terms of large-scale epidemiological data or in individual clinical cases. For example, in the DSC study, one doctor described the debates that would likely ensue if more patients were to start employing at-home diagnostic testing and bringing those results to their doctors. The availability of at-home testing could provide data that providers were unsure what to do with, or were uncertain of if it were reliable, thus prompting a need for follow-up testing. The respondent went on to discuss other examples, such as direct-to-consumer genetic testing that might give a result of a polymorphism that increases the likelihood of developing a condition such as osteoporosis. The doctor pondered what kind of course of action this at-home genetic result might lead to when the data was brought into the clinic, as well as whether or not further testing requested by the doctor on the basis of the at-home finding would be reimbursed by an insurance company.",

Specifically, the work done in the context of (1) quality control and improvement was regularly seen as adding value emerging form data use. This included the standardising and cleaning datasets, recoding, or mitigating bias. The (2) collection of large sets of high-quality data from many units of observation/individuals was seen to enhance the value emerging from the use of such data. Also (3) the facilitation of data linkage and reuse (e.g. the standardisation of data and annotation, interoperability, legal foundation for reuse, storage), as well as (4) improving accessibility were seen to increase value for data users. Work done towards (5) creating human-machine interfaces and improving machine readability, and (6) the contextualisation of datasets (e.g. by adding metadata, fitting data and context of use by various forms of data manipulation, recoding, or anonymising) was also seen to positively influence the value emerging from data use, as was (7) regulatory alignment (e.g. fitting data and regulatory environment, ethics of data collection and use). Finally, (8) claiming ownership of data (legally and practically), and controlling data use, and were seen to either add value or detract from it, depending on the specificities of the situation (Who claims ownership?

Here, our typology can be useful for better differentiating between the purpose of use: rather than speaking of 'medical treatment' or 'pandemic management,' the typology enables a more precise consideration of, say, anticipation of treatment outcome, proxy replacement of study subjects, classification of disease clusters, and more. In doing so, we argue that to assess the value of specific instances of data use, the typology provides a missing link between types of data (survey data/registry data; personal data/non-personal data; etc.) and purpose of use (pandemics management, insurance fraud detection, drug research, medical treatment, etc.). Only on this basis we can answer the question whether data use has benefits for specific groups of people, or even for society as a whole-and at what costs this may come and for whom. The proposed typology aims to assist in this work. As it is now, we anticipate that the typology will be most useful for researchers and those involved in regulation.",

In an age where different datasets can be integrated and interlinked, and health-relevant inferences can be made even from health information that has no obvious link to health, we argue that it no longer makes sense for regulators to put so much weight on the characteristics of data sets (Prainsack 2017) . Instead of working from a premise that certain types of data are more or less risky or sensitive, regulation should pay more attention to the practice, context, and purpose of use of datasets. As the examples illustrating the typology show, value depends on context and relationships: what value is achieved by using a specific set of health data and by whom? Aggregated sets of de-identified data that are analysed, for example, to see how healthcare services can be organised to better meet the needs of underserved populations, should be treated differently from the same datasets being used to help a commercial health insurer sort out which patients are 'undesirable.' In other words, a key criterion for regulation should be whether specific types of data use are in the public interest. Public interest is the case, very generally, if it will plausibly have clear benefits for many patients, society as a whole, or future generations, and no person or group will experience significant harm. Moreover, public interest is more pronounced if the benefits are likely to mate-rialise for underprivileged groups than for privileged people, due to the overall lower baseline and potential size of impact. (Prainsack and Buyx 2016, p. 497) If we subscribe to the idea that regulation should pay explicit attention to whether or not a specific instance of data use is in the public interest, we need more fine-grained instruments to differentiate between different types of value that data create, and for whom. The typology proposed here should be understood as an intermediate step for assessing the public value of a specific data use. We need to better understand the roles health data assume to then link this to values and actors. This task takes on increased importance during moments such as the Covid-19 pandemic where health data has taken on new prominence in public debates over the management of health risks and inequalities, and the restriction of individual liberties in the name of public health. Knowing that the use context is classification or anticipation is not enough to decide whether a specific instance of data use is in the public interest (as anticipation can lead to better treatment choices, but also to risk-adjusted insurance fees).",

In reflecting on the roles of data over the past year during the Covid-19 crisis, we have seen that different interpretations of regulation such as the GDPR have led to a patchwork response and increasing calls for data sharing in the name of public health. As Becker et al. (2020) argue, the pandemic has created a situation where there are clear reasons for attending to the public interest in health data processing. Existing provisions in the GDPR related to the processing of health data and other derogations to data subject rights on the basis of public interest could help more countries to contribute to public health research. Others have argued that the use of such exemptions may actually place an ethical obligation on policy makers and practitioners in the context of the pandemic to support collaborative research efforts in global health (McLennan et al. 2020) . Focusing on the use and not the type of data (such as format or source) can help researchers, regulators, and the public to advance a more nuanced discussion of the risks, harms and benefits that emerge from the context of use. The transition to use turns our attention the ways that data flow, and how flows are divided and obstructed: where and how data flow, and who ends up using them, have valuation effects which are far more complicated than understandings of data as simply 'open.') This transition in attention helps shift focus from the legal question of whether a specific dataset can be considered anonymous (for an overview see the discussions around the GDPR; Finck and Pallas 2020; \"General Data Protection Regulation [GDPR],\" 2016, p. Recital 26) to the question of assessing the benefits and harms of using the dataset.",

In showing the different repertoires of valuation and types of value in health data, we believe that the typology complements scholarship on data flows literature. Yet at the same time, the typology illustrates that the flows of value and valuation do not necessarily correspond with the physical flows of data; a focus on data use instead of data type can foster an openness to the ways that data are being taken up in the world rather than a continued focus on pre-determined types within the healthcare context.",

The typology identifies the roles of digital data in the health domain, asking: What can data (help actors to) do? What value does the data create? What practices affect the value of the data? Below we elaborate on each of the roles of digital data that we have identified, with the caveat that the typology does not aim to be exhaustive nor are the categories intended to be exclusive.
