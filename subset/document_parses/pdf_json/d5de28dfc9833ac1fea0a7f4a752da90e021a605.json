Even in the high pressure area of the esophagus, at the level of the cricopharyngeal muscle, the overtube containing the SGB passed through easily, thus minimizing the risk of damage to the esophagus or device loss in the digestive tract. The use of the overtube practically annulled the risk of tracheal aspiration of saline solution or food residues, thus making the procedure of tracheal intubation unnecessary for controlling these risks. Furthermore, the shortened removal time of SGB resulted in using fewer antispasmodics and decreasing thereby the patient's discomfort, mainly due to lower transparietal stimulation by the endoscopic apparatus and consequent reduction of the spasms of the cardia and the esophagus.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "All the 14 patients who completed the 6-month treatment with SGB lost weight, the mean loss being 11.3\u00b16.2 kg, which is less than the losses of other larger clinical series: Herv\u00e9 et al.

The continuous use of the PPI during treatment is mandatory to ensure this safety by protecting the gastric mucosa and the balloon shell from the deleterious effect of the hydrochloric acid. As a result of this continuous use and consequent reduction in gastric acidity, the patient's digestive tract becomes a more favorable environment to the Candida sp, and this explains the colonization of the SGB shell by these fungi in some of the cases.
