Because the genome sequence for one of these isolates 4 is available, we conducted comparative evolutionary analyses of the spike gene of this strain 5 (CCoV-HuPn-2018), with other available Alphacoronavirus 1 spike sequences. The most N-6 terminus subdomain (0-domain) of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 spike protein has sequence similarity 7 to Transmissible Gastroenteritis Virus (TGEV) and CCoV2b strains, but not to other members of 8 the type II Alphacoronaviruses (i.e., CCoV2a and Feline CoV2-FCoV2). This 0-domain in CCoV-9 HuPn-2018 has evidence for relaxed selection pressure, an increased rate of molecular 10 evolution, and a number of unique amino acid substitutions relative to CCoV2b and TGEV 11 sequences. A region of the 0-domain determined to be key to sialic acid binding and 12 pathogenesis in TGEV had clear differences in amino acid sequences in CCoV-HuPn-2018 13 relative to both CCoV2b (enteric) and TGEV (enteric and respiratory). The 0-domain of CCoV-14 HuPn-2018 also had several sites inferred to be under positive diversifying selection, including 15 sites within the signal peptide. Downstream of the 0-domain, FCoV2 shared sequence similarity 16 to the CCoV2b and TGEV sequences, with analyses of this larger alignment identifying 17 positively selected sites in the putative Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) and Connector Domain 18 (CD). Recombination analyses strongly implicated a particular FCoV2 strain in the recombinant 19 history of CCoV-HuPn-2018 with molecular divergence times estimated at around 60 years ago.",

            "text": "We hypothesize that CCoV-HuPn-2018 had an enteric origin, but that it has lost that particular 21 tropism, because of mutations in the sialic acid binding region of the spike 0-domain. As 22 selection pressure on this region was reduced, the virus evolved a respiratory tropism, 23 analogous to other Alphacoronavirus 1, such as Porcine Respiratory Coronavirus (PRCV), that 24 have lost this region entirely. We also suggest that signals of positive selection in the signal 25 peptide as well as other changes in the 0-domain of CCoV-HuPn-2018 could represent an 26 adaptive role in this new host and that this could be in part due to the different spatial 27 distribution of the N-linked glycan repertoire for this strain. 28 29 53 component of CoV host tropism is the binding of the spike protein with host cellular receptors. 54 The spike protein is responsible for host receptor binding and fusion of the virus and host cell 55 membranes (Li, 2016). It is comprised of the N-terminal S1 region, containing the receptor 56 binding domain (RBD), and the C-terminal S2 region, responsible for membrane fusion. The 57 CCoV receptor in dogs, and for the rest of the type II members of the Alphacoronavirus 1 58 species, is amino peptidase N (APN) (reviewed in Millet et al. 2021). The human common-cold 59 coronavirus, HCoV-229E, another Alphacoronavirus, (not Alphacoronavirus 1) also uses APN. 60 Structural studies involving porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV; closely related to TGEV) 61 indicate that it binds to a site on porcine APN that differs from the site at which HCoV-229E 62 binds to hAPN (Reguera et al. 2012; Wong et al. 2017), implying that there are multiple ways for 63 this interaction to take place. Importantly, feline APN can serve as a functional receptor of type 64",

Type I and type II Alphacoronavirus 1 viruses were 101 not included together in sequence alignments used for selection analyses, because of the 102 divergence between these two types. 103 We prepared two sets of alignments for comparative sequence analyses. The first of 104 these (set I) included TGEV, CCoV-HuPn-2018, and the CCoV2b strains. This set of sequences 105 was assembled for the analysis of the N-terminus subdomain and we only consider results 106 involving the first 288 aligned amino acid positions (up to and including position 266 of CCoV-107 HuPn-2018) referred to as the 0-domain in the FIPV structural paper (Yang et al. 2020) , and 108 here.

Each of the resulting GARD fragments served as input to the selection analyses, 122 concomitant with their respective phylogeny, which was inferred using RaxML (Stamatakis 123 2014) under the GTR+\u0393 nucleotide substitution model. 124 We performed site-, branch-, and alignment-level selection tests based on the dN/dS 125 (nonsynonymous / synonymous) ratio estimation as implemented in the HyPhy software 126 package v.2.5.31 (Kosakovsky Pond et al. 2020) . We used the MEME method (Murrell et al. 127 2012) to look for episodic diversifying selection pressure at individual sites across the entire tree 128 (both sets I and II). We tested the CCoV-HuPn-2018 terminal branch for evidence of selection, both overall (some subset of sites along this branch), using the aBSREL , and 130 BUSTED methods, and at individual sites using the FEL (Kosakovsky Pond 131 et al. 2005) and MEME (Murrell et al. 2012) methods. We modified the FEL and MEME tests to Information Criterion (BIC). Each tree with the best-fitting substitution model was then used as 146 input for root-to-tip regression analysis, where correlation coefficients were calculated using the 147 heuristic residual mean squared function. If a strong temporal signal exists (a linear relationship 148 between genetic distance and sampling time), the correlation coefficient will be positive. For 149 GARD partitions with correlation coefficient greater than 0.1, temporal signal was confirmed 150 using TDR. The R package TipDatingBeast (Rieux et al. 2017 ) was used to generate ten 151 random permutations of sample dates for each GARD alignment. BEAST2 (Bouckaert et al. 152 2014) was then used to estimate the evolutionary rate for both alignments with the true sample 153 dates and alignments for each randomized replicate. If the mean clock rate estimate of the 154 alignment with real sample dates fell outside the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) for the 155 randomized date set, temporal signal was deemed sufficient for subsequent analyses. (Yang et al. 2020) . S1, S2, of spike are highlighted and the protein is further subdivided into functional subunits and subdomains. Blue dots represent sites under positive selection in CCoV-HuPn-2018 as identified by MEME and FEL in the single branch tests; red dots represent sites that are unique in CCoV-HuPn-2018, but are not under positive selection; black \"x\"s indicate sites under positive selection in the MEME test of the complete alignment that had moderate EBF values for CCoV-HuPn-2018. Red text labels accompany each subdomain/functional unit and are based on the original FIPV spike structure (Yang et al. 2020 ): SP, signal peptide; 0 domain; A domain; B, includes RBD-Receptor-Binding Domain; C; D; UH, upstream helix; S2', S2' cleavage (predicted furin site, using ProP1.0 (Duckert et al. 2004) ); FP, fusion peptide; HR1, heptad repeat region 1; CH, central helix; CD, connector domain; HR2, heptad repeat region 2; TM, transmembrane domain; CT, cytoplasmic tail. The dashed line between D and UH refers to a region of peptide with no sequence similarity between FIPV and CCoV-HuPn-2018; this region includes the S1/S2 furin cleavage site in FIPV, which is absent in CCoV-HuPn-2018. The vertical black lines represent the breakpoints of the GARD identified non-recombinant fragments, and are labeled numerically. The \u29ea symbol represents a 3' GARD fragment of alignment set I that was analyzed for positive selection; this GARD fragment was determined from an alignment of just CCoV2b and TGEV sequences (set I). The 5' end of GARD fragment 2 represents the onset of FCoV2 sequence similarity (set II). when we refer to a sequence as a donor in the following descriptions, it applies to, and is limited 217 by, the sequences in this alignment, and that other closely related genetic variants could be the 218 precise donor. A total of 19 recombination events were well supported (Table S3 ) by a subset of 219 three or more of the recombination detection methods implemented in RDP5 including BURT, 220 RDP, MaxChi (Smith 1992) and GENECONV (Padidam et al 1999; ) . Of the 19 supported (Table S4) (Rasschaert et al. 1990 ). This 0-domain deletion and the resulting loss in sialic acid 279 binding led to a switch in tropism and pathogenicity for PRCV to predominantly respiratory tract-280 tropic (Krempl et al. 1997) . TGEV on the other hand can infect both the respiratory and enteric Yang et al. 2020; 330 Wu et al. 2009 ) and the specifics of the interaction between these loops and APN, even 331 between closely related viruses, can be very different . that the signal peptide can influence the glycan profile and antigenicity of the HIV surface 344 protein gp120 (Yolitz et al. 2018) , prompting these authors to suggest that despite the fact the 345 signal peptide is not part of the mature protein, it is likely to be subject to immune pressure.",

The origins of WSU 79-392 1683 may also include two recombination events in the Orf1ab region with FCoV1 and CCoV as 393 sequence donors (Herrewegh et al. 1998 ). These observations lead us to conclude that WSU 394 79-1683, or its close relative, has had a prominent role in the evolution of CCoV-HuPn-2018 and 395 that these viruses have repeatedly coinfected hosts, resulting in recombinant progeny. 396 We propose that at some time in the history of CCoV-HuPn-2018, its spike protein 0- ",

The genome sequence of one of these isolates was 42 obtained, while the other seven were diagnosed based on PCR tests. Genomically, the virus 43 resembles a CCoV type II, but also shares high nucleotide sequence similarity with other type II 44 Alphacoronavirus 1 viruses: feline CoV (FCOV2), and the porcine Transmissible Gastroenteritis 45 Virus (TGEV). 46 Zoonotic transmissions of CoVs represent an important threat to human health, with 47 many unknown possible reservoir hosts. The Vlasova et al. report is the first example of a 48 Canine CoV isolated from a human patient with pneumonia, although the virus has not been 49 confirmed as the causative pathogen and inter-individual transmission has not been 50 established. However, the obvious importance of a jump from a companion animal such as a 51 dog or a cat, or from a farm animal such as a pig, to a human host, raises concerns and 52 questions about possible adaptative tropism of veterinary coronaviruses to humans. A key spike gene of a CCoV such as CCoV-HuPn-2018, acquired either through recombination or 79 diversifying selection, could facilitate adaptation to a new host's receptor(s). Here, we provide a 80 further perspective on the recombination history involving the spike gene of CCoV-HuPn-2018, 81 with other members of the Alphacoronavirus 1 type II species, and characterize selection 82 pressures across the spike gene, focusing on where such events are in relation to spike",

The 0-255 domain of CCoV-HuPn-2018 (GARD partition 1; Fig. 1) had seven unique amino acid residues 256 relative to the sequences in the set II alignment, two of which were inferred to be evolving under 257 positive selection (one in the signal peptide). This portion of the CCoV-HuPn-2018 NTD 258 comprises 288 residues with homology only to available TGEV and CCoV2b isolates. Earlier 259 studies have reported on this similarity, implicating recombination between CCoV2 and TGEV 260 (Wesley 1999; Decaro et al. 2009) in the origins of CCoV2b (Wesley 1999). These recombinant 261 CCoV2b are circulating among the domestic dog population (Decaro et al. 2009). The 0-domain 262 region (Fig. 1) is subject to relaxed selection (analysis conducted with RELAX -Wertheim et al. 263 2015) compared to the other CCoV sequences (GARD partition 1; RELAX results: K=0.07; 264 p=0.005). It has an increased rate of molecular evolution relative to the other CCoV and TGEV sequences (significant Tajima's relative rate test, implemented in MEGA X -Kumar et al. 2018; 266 all three codon positions, as well synonymous alone, and for most nonsynonymous pairwise 267 comparisons). This selective relaxation suggests that at least some of the history of CCoV-268 HuPn-2018 involves the loss of function or loosening of functional constraints of this domain, 269 and may also suggest that this region may have different functional roles in humans and dogs. 270 The role of spike NTD domains in CoV infections is increasingly being recognized. The 271 NTD may act as a co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2, interacting with tyrosine-protein kinase receptor 272 UFO (AXL; Wang et al. 2021) and possibly sialic acids (reviewed in Sun 2021). Sialic acid 273 binding in the NTD has been confirmed for TGEV and PEDV (Schultze et al. 1996; Liu et al. 274 2015). Point mutations or a short deletion near the N-terminus in TGEV eliminate sialic acid 275 binding, and are associated with lower viral pathogenicity (Krempl et al. 1997). The complete 276 absence of the 0-domain in porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV; closely related to TGEV), 277 which includes the region involved in the Krempl et al (1997) experiments, eliminated sialic acid 278 binding",

Krempl 283 et al. identified, and experimentally confirmed, a ten-residue region of the 0-domain that is 284 essential for TGEV pathogenicity. This same region in our TGEV/CCoV2b/CCoV-HuPn-2018 285 alignment has three amino acid changes and one amino acid deletion in CCoV-HuPn-2018 286 relative to TGEV (and no changes in TGEV). Regions upstream and downstream of these ten287 amino acids are strongly conserved. This general region of the sequence, between 143-168 of 288 our alignment (Supplementary Fig. S5; 143-153 of CCoV-HuPn-2018 sequence), is the most 289 variable section of the 0-domain across these viruses, with two gaps to accommodate two six 290 amino-acid insertions in the CCoV2b sequences. Although these CCoV2b insertions are of the 291 same length, they differ in amino acid composition. 292 In summary: (a) CCoV-HuPn-2018, shows evidence of relaxed selection in the 0-domain 293 portion of NTD; (b) there are numerous amino acid changes for CCoV-HuPn-2018 in this region 294 that were not associated with signals of positive selection (Fig. 1); (c) the 0-domain of CCoV-295 HuPn-2018 has an increased rate of molecular evolution; (d) unique amino acid changes, and 296 an amino acid deletion, in CCoV-HuPn-2018 are evident in a ten residue area of the 0-domain 297 experimentally determined to be key to sialic acid binding in TGEV and to affect TGEV 298 pathogenicity (e) this same specific sialic acid binding region of CCoV-HuPn-2018 shares no 299 sequence similarity to CCoV2b, as does much of the surrounding sequence, including two 6 300 amino acid insertions unique to CCoV2b -a solely enteric pathogen (f) Alpha-respiratory 301 viruses such as PRCV and HCoV-229E have lost the 0-domain; (g) CCoV-HuPn-2018 was 302 associated with a respiratory infection in the Malaysian patients. This leads us to hypothesize 303 that CCoV-HuPn-2018 had an enteric origin, has lost that particular tropism, due in part to 304 mutations in the sialic acid binding region of the 0-domain, resulting in reduced selection 305 pressure for this subdomain. Analogous to other Alphacoronavirus 1, such as PRCV, that have 306 lost this region entirely, it has evolved a respiratory tropism. Furthermore, we suggest the 307 possibility that the CCoV-HuPn-2018 lineage might eventually lose this region entirely, just like 308 PRCV, but that we are witnessing early stages of this process. A similar deletion of 197 amino 309 acids has been reported in the 0-domain of some strains of PEDV, an Alphacornavirus 2 (Oka 310 et al. 2014); in this case, without evidence of tropism shift, but with experimental evidence that 311this deletion attenuates the virus, likely due to its loss of sialic acid binding(Hou et al. 2017).",

As 354 a control we also performed the N-linked glycosylation site inference on the FIPV UU4 355 sequence using NetNglyc and identified almost all of the experimentally verified sites (Yang et 356 al. 2020) for this sequence. Thus, CCoV-HuPn-2018 appears to have a slightly different 357 repertoire of N-linked sites compared to CCoV2b, and with several of these differences 358 occurring in the 0-domain. None of these N-linked glycosylation sites were positively selected in 359 CCoV-HuPn-2018. Positive selection of sites within signal peptides has been reported for other 360 viruses, such as cytomegalovirus, where it was demonstrated that the selected variants affect 361 the timing of signal peptide removal and viral glycoprotein intracellular trafficking (Mozzi et al. 362 2020). We propose that positive selection in the signal peptide of CCoV-HuPn-2018 could 363 reflect an adaptive role in this new host and that the unique amino acid changes in the signal 364 peptide of CCoV-HuPn-2018 compared to CCoV2b and TGEV, could be playing a role with 365 regards to the N-linked glycan repertoire of this strain.

Two of the recombination events identified by RDP5, at the 5' end of 370 the A-domain (events 5 and 13 in Fig. S2), have similar predicted breakpoint locations which 371 overlap almost exactly with GARD partition 2. For one of these events (event 5), CCoV-HuPn-372 2018 is identified as a possible sequence donor and FCoV2 as a recombinant, and in the other 373 (event 13), CCoV-HuPn-2018 is the proposed recombinant with FCoV2 as the proposed donor 374 sequence. The detection of both events involved the same FCoV2 sequence (strain WSU 79-375 1683; accession number JN634064), isolated at Washington State University in 1979 376 (McKeirnan et al. 1981). A 2009 survey of cats in two Malaysian catteries, using PCR primers 377 designed from strain WSU-79-1683 and FIPV79-1146, found a high prevalence of FCoV test 378 positives (Sharif et al. 2009). While these apparently convergent recombination events could 379 indicate a recombination hotspot, it is also plausible that either (1) there was a single 380 recombination event in FCoV2 that was misidentified as a recombination event in CCoV-HuPn-381 2018, or (2) there were two unique recombination events, as inferred by RDP5, one in FCoV2 382 and the other in CCoV-HuPn-2018. 383 The FCoV2 JN634064 sequence is also a very close sister group to CCoV-HuPn-2018 384 for GARD partitions 2, 6, 7, and 8 (Supplementary Fig. S1), with 6-8 spanning most of the S2 385 domain. The BEAST analysis timed the split of WSU 79-1683 and CCoV-HuPn-2018 in partition 386 7 at 1957. The high prevalence of FCoV2 in Malaysian cats, suggested by the Sharif et al. 387 study, concomitant with their primer construction strategy, suggests the possibility that a WSU 388 79-1683-like virus could be the prevalent FCoV2 strain in Malaysia. There are also the 389 experimental results of",

Importantly, other viruses in this group such as 398 PRCV, exhibit a similar evolutionary trajectory where an eventual complete loss of this region of 399 the protein is associated with a shift from enteric to respiratory tropism. Both the molecular 400 details underlying how the loss of this domain contributes to tropic shift of this sort, and the 401 reason(s) that zoonotic host shifts in CoVs are frequently coincidental with respiratory infection, 402 remain important unsolved mysteries. Timing of the origins of CCoV-HuPn-2018 to 403 approximately 1957 suggest that this virus may have been circulating undetected in humans, 404 dogs, cats, or intermediate unidentified hosts for decades. This, in turn, leads us to whole-405 heartedly concur with the suggestions of Vlasova et al. that a systematic survey should be 406 conducted for the prevalence of CCoV-HuPn-2018 in the host species that comprise the 407 complex history of this virus. 408 Conflicts of interest: None declared.",

Partial spike 89 sequences of Alphacoronavirus 1 were excluded from our analysis, as were strains determined from associated publications, to have been be serially passaged (including experimental inoculations of any kind). CCoV type II viruses are currently split into two groups: CCov2a and CCoV2b. Our choice of CCoV2b as our representative CoV from the dog host is based on the fact the most N-terminus subdomain of the spike protein of CCoV2b and TGEV share sequence similarity to CCoV-HuPn-2018, whereas this is not the case for either CCoV2a or FCoV2. Spike domain site positional mapping is based on serotype I feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV1;Yang et al. 2020) which is the only Alphacoronavirus 1 with a currently available spike protein crystal structure. Although a similar domain map is not available for type II Alphacoronavirus 1s, there is sufficient amino acid sequence similarity between type II Alphacoronavirus 1s and FIPV",
