This review highlights the medical, social, and cultural factors of AUD in older adults and provides guidelines for its screening, evaluation, and management. Recent Findings The COVID-19 pandemic has created additional challenges and barriers to care, as older adults may have disproportionate worsening of anxiety, depression, and substance use resulting from increased isolation related to physical distancing and shelter-in-place guidelines. Summary All older adults should be routinely screened for AUD with standardized screening tools. If a patient's screening results are positive, a clinician should conduct a brief assessment, which may be supplemented by laboratory tests. Most older adults at risk for alcohol misuse do not need specialized SUD treatment, but most can benefit from Screening, Brief Intervention, and Referral to Treatment (SBIRT) to prevent substance misuse before it occurs. Medications for the treatment of AUD in older adults include naltrexone, acamprosate, disulfiram, gabapentin and topiramate. Psychosocial treatments, including mutual help groups, are equally important.",

In the 2012-2013 Wave of the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC III), 2.3% of adults aged 65 years and older met criteria for Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD) within the past 12 months, and 13.4% met criteria during their lifetime [2] .",

            "text": "Older adults are not a homogenous group, however, and their presentations may vary based on medical comorbidities, lifestyle factors, and duration and severity of substance use. Additionally, they may have a range of opinions and attitudes towards substance use; thus, an age and culturally sensitive and individualized approach can improve treatment outcomes [3] . Chronological age may not reliably predict health status. Some adults over 65 years of age may have better physical health status than their similarly aged peers. On the other hand, chronic alcohol use contributes to increased morbidity, exacerbation of existing health conditions, and neurotoxic and neuropathological changes [5] . Despite this growing problem, AUD in later life is often underdiagnosed, underreported, or overlooked, and consequently is often not managed [4\u2022] . Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) criteria are geared towards younger adults and may not appropriately screen and diagnose older adults. Social and occupational impairments due to alcohol use may go unnoticed or unreported for older adults who are retired, live alone, or are socially isolated [4\u2022] . DSM criteria highlight increasing use and efforts to cut back on use. However, many older adults continue with problematic drinking at the same level as they have for years and may have problematic use without efforts to cut back and at lower levels of use compared to younger adults [6] . Additionally, AUD in older adults can mimic other diagnoses which are common in later life, such as cognitive impairment or depression. Ageist beliefs among patients, family members and providers pose additional barriers to diagnosis and treatment. Older adults may minimize their substance use to healthcare providers. Family members may believe that SUDs in late life do not exist or do not need treatment, and consequently overlook substance use among older adults. Finally, healthcare providers may refrain from asking about substance use due to fear of offending older adults or may focus more on their reports of physical complaints [7] .",

In a self-report survey of 1982 American adults, 34% reported binge drinking during the COVID-19 pandemic. For every week spent at home, there was a 1.21 greater odds of binge drinking (95% CI: 1.08-1. 35) , and binge drinkers with previous or current depression had greater increase in alcohol consumption compared to those without depression (AOR 1.80, 95% CI: 1.15-2.81) [9] . A study of 3358 middle-aged British adults found that the prevalence of highrisk drinking increased from 19.4% between 2016 and 2018 (when the cohort was aged 46-48 years) to 24.6% in May 2020 (aged 50 years) and the prevalence of drinking >4 times a week doubled from 12.5% to 26% during this period [10] . This increase was not moderated by gender, marital status, education level, or presence of a chronic illness. Barriers to SUD care during COVID-19 include the closure of treatment facilities, focus of emergency departments on COVID-19 patients, physical distancing and shelter in place orders affecting mental health, and threats to income and resources of individuals with SUDs [11] . Older adults are especially vulnerable to the physical and mental health challenges and barriers to SUD care imposed by the intersection of the COVID pandemic and the SUD epidemic.",

Older adults are more likely to be taking multiple medications which increases their risk for drug-drug interaction and falls.

Other psychoeducation can include discussion of medical consequences of alcohol use such as cognitive impairment, increased risk of falls, and liver dysfunction/disease. Motivational interviewing techniques are commonly used in BAIs and can be administered not only by a physician, but also other members of the treatment team such as nurses, social workers, and psychologists. Historically, BAIs have often been delivered as part of the SBIRT model, and thus are seen commonly in the primary care setting [28] . Treatment planning should involve shared decision making to choose the level of care that is the least intensive but will still address the patient's needs. Depending on the patient's needs and treatment goals, treatment may be able to be provided in a primary care or general mental health setting; alternately, referral to specialty treatment may be indicated. An individualized assessment will help determine what level of care is indicated. Factors shown to improve patient outcomes include shared decision making with the patient and incorporation of the older adult in treatment programs where other members are of similar age and functional status [29] [30] [31] . Treatment planning for the older adult should also include consideration of age-related factors such as cognition, hearing impairment, or any other physical or functional decline [14\u2022 ]. If cognitive impairment is present, the extent of the patient's impairment will need to be assessed and treatment planning may need to involve family members or legal guardians [32, 33] .",

Connecting patients to social support is also key to recovery from alcohol use disorder. Older adults have better longterm outcomes when their social supports promote abstinence [50, 51] . Sources of social support include family and friends, religious or spiritual groups, and mutual-help groups. Mutualhelp programs can include more structured programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) which help connect patients to a network of peers to whom they can relate [14\u2022] . For patients seeking an alternative to AA, Self-Management and Recovery Training (SMART) differs from AA in that it is run by trained volunteers and is based on principles of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational interviewing (MI). Some of the CBT and MI skills include building and keeping up motivation, coping with urges, managing thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and living a balanced life [14\u2022 ]. During the COVID-19 pandemic, mutual-help groups are more likely to be occurring through \"virtual\" platforms such as video or telephone which can be an advantage for patients needing to physically distance or if transportation is a barrier. However, some older adults may lack the necessary technology.",
