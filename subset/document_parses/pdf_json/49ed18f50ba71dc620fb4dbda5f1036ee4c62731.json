The transmission of aggregates requires neuron-released Tau to interact with surface receptors on target cells. However, the underlying molecular mechanisms in astrocytes and downstream effects are unclear. Here, using a spatially resolved proteomic mapping strategy, we show that integrin \u03b1V/\u03b21 receptor binds recombinant human Tau, mediating the entry of Tau fibrils in astrocytes. The binding of distinct Tau species to the astrocytic \u03b1V/\u03b21 receptor differentially activate integrin signaling. Furthermore, Tau-mediated activation of integrin signaling results in NF\u03baB activation, causing upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, induction of a sub-group of neurotoxic astrocytic markers, and release of neurotoxic factors. Our findings suggest that filamentous recombinant human Tau-mediated activation of integrin signaling induces astrocyte conversion towards a neurotoxic state, providing a mechanistic insight into tauopathies.",

NFTs are formed primarily by hyperphosphorylated Tau, a soluble microtubule-binding protein abundantly expressed in neurons of the central nervous system (CNS) 1, 2 . The primary function of Tau is to stabilize microtubules, but its intrinsic misfolding propensity prompts it to form toxic filamentous aggregates, particularly in neurons during aging. In addition to AD, Tau-containing NFTs have been linked to brain dysfunctions in other neurodegenerative diseases such as Pick's disease and frontotemporal dementia, which are collectively termed Tauopathies 1 .",

This protein propagation process may involve the release of Tau in either monomeric or aggregated forms, followed by the uptake by recipient cells (neurons or glial cells) 7 . Tau fibrils formed along this path can serve as 'seeds' once inside a target cell, converting endogenous Tau monomers into an aggregation-prone toxic conformer. Accumulating evidence suggests that both monomeric Tau and Tau aggregates can be released from neurons independent of cell death, and this process is enhanced by neuronal activities [8] [9] [10] . The mechanisms underlying Tau release are controversial.",

We used the labeled protein to generate PFFs following a wellestablished protocol ( Supplementary Fig. 1b) 31 , and then treated mouse primary astrocytes with labeled monomeric Tau or PFFs. Incubating astrocytes with Tau for up to 6 h did not cause detectable cell death ( Supplementary Fig. 1c ) but led to efficient internalization of Tau PFFs. Unlike immortalized cell lines, Tau PFF uptake by primary astrocytes was largely unaffected by heparin ( Supplementary Fig. 1d, e) , a competitive inhibitor that blocks Tau PFF binding to HSPGs in some cell lines [19] [20] [21] . This result is in line 6 with another study, which suggests that primary astrocytes do not use HSPGs for Tau PFF internalization 32 . Instead, an unknown Tau receptor(s) is involved.",

Therefore, we employed a proximity labelingbased proteomic mapping strategy using purified APEX2-tagged Tau monomer as the bait ( Figure 1a ). APEX2 is an engineered peroxidase that can covalently tag proximal lysine side chains with biotin molecules in the presence of biotin-phenoxyl radicals 33 . Because the relatively large APEX2 fusion might affect the interaction of Tau with the plasma membrane, we first used Sh-SY5Y cells to characterize the membrane interaction of Tau fusion proteins (Figure 1b) . When APEX2 was fused to the C-terminus of Tau, Tau-APEX2 bound efficiently to the cell surface in a dose dependent manner, but the addition of APEX2 to the N-terminus abolished the binding ( Supplementary Fig. 2a, b) . Thus, consistent with previous reports 34, 35 , Tau binding to the plasma membrane is mediated by a sequence near the N-terminus, which can be masked by a proximal APEX2 fusion.",

Following cell surface biotinylation and streptavidin pulldown, these proteins could be detected by immunoblotting using antibodies recognizing their corresponding tags (Figure 1d, Supplementary Fig. 2e ), suggesting that they could indeed be biotinylated by Tau-APEX2. Similar experiments performed in primary astrocytes further confirmed that endogenous ITG\u03b1V/\u03b21 could be biotinylated by Tau-APEX2 but not APEX2 (Figure 1e ). Importantly, after Tau-APEX2 binding to the cell surface, immunoprecipitation of Tau-APEX2 from cell extracts using a Tau specific 8 antibody also co-precipitated endogenous ITG\u03b1V/\u03b21 ( Figure 1f ).

Furthermore, knockdown of Talin1, an adaptor essential for integrin signaling and integrin-mediated endocytosis 41-43 also led to a significant reduction in Tau PFF uptake (Figure 2e , f, g). The fact that knockdown of three different integrin pathway components all reduced Tau PFF uptake ruled out the possibility of an off-target effect. Intriguingly, treating cells with a potent inhibitor (PF-562271) of the focal adhesion kinase (FAK), an essential integrin regulatory kinase downstream of Talin1 did not affect Tau PFF endocytosis (Figure 2h , i), nor did it affect cell viability ( Supplementary Fig. 3c ).

Interestingly, qRT-PCR showed that both Tau monomer and PFFs induced the expression of many pan-reactive and A1 specific genes such as Gbp2, H2-T23, Ggta, Ligp1, Psmb8 etc with PFFs generally causing a higher level of induction than monomer ( Figure 6a ).

Knockdown of either Itg\u03b1V/\u03b21 or Talin1 dramatically reduced Tau PFF-associated gene induction (Figure 6b, c, Fig. S5 ), so did the treatment with PF-562271 and the NF kB inhibitor PDTC (Pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate) 50 (Figure 6d , e) .

Tau-containing aggregates have also been detected in glial cells (both microglia and astrocytes), although endogenous Tau is not expressed in these cells. This suggests that pathological Tau inclusions may also be transmitted from neurons to glia [56] [57] [58] [59] .

In light of these observations and our findings, we propose that integrin receptors on astrocytes may sense extracellular Astrocytes, as the most abundant glial cells in the CNS, are a well-established modulator of neurodegeneration-associated inflammation 47 . Specifically, diseaseassociated abnormal proteins such as A\u03b2 and \u03b1-Syn fibrils can change astrocyte physiology. For instance, different A\u03b2 species can activate disparate astrocytic cell receptors to induce the pro-inflammatory NF-\u03baB pathway [68] [69] [70] [71] .

This gain-of-function state, which has been associated with astrocytic inflammation, was suggested to play a causal role in neurodegeneration, but the upstream signals that promote astrocytic activation are unclear. Particularly, existing evidence suggests that the A1 state could only be achieved by a relayed signal elicited from microglial cells exposed to an extracellular insult such as LPS. By contrast, we showed that even in the absence of microglia, misfolded Tau aggregates can trigger astrocyte activation via ITG\u03b1V/\u03b21. This suggests that astrocytic inflammation may be a key contributor to tauopathies. Additionally, given that neurons are usually the major source of secreted Tau, our findings raise the possibility that astrocytes may monitor the healthy state of neurons by sensing the level of misfolded Tau released.",

This model does not exclude the possibility that the astrocytic inflammation status may be partially modulated by endocytosed Tau-integrin complex or by a combined activation of integrin and other cell signaling pathways on the cell surface. Intriguingly, Tau fibrils and monomers can differentially activate integrin signaling, which might be due to their different oligomeric states. In support of this view, recent studies have underscored the role of liquid-liquid phase separation in transmembrane receptor signaling 66 . Specifically, the coagulation of membrane receptors into a gel-like state upon binding to a multivalent ligand can dramatically amplify the magnitude of downstream signaling. Indeed, receptor clustering upon binding of a multivalent ligand is known to potentiate the outside-in integrin signaling 67 .",
