Rho-associated coiled-coil-forming protein kinase (ROCK) consists as two isoforms, ROCK1 and ROCK2, and both are playing critical roles in many cellular responses to injury. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the differential role of ROCK isoforms on TGF-\u03b2 signaling in lung fibrosis and repair. For this purpose, we tested the effect of a non-selective ROCK 1 and 2 inhibitor (compound 31) and a selective ROCK2 inhibitor (compound A11) in inhibiting TGF\u03b2-induced remodeling in lung fibroblasts and slices; and dysfunctional epithelialprogenitor interactions in lung organoids. Here, we demonstrated that the inhibition of ROCK1/2 with compound 31 represses TGF-\u03b2-driven actin remodeling as well as extracellular matrix deposition in lung fibroblasts and PCLS, whereas selective ROCK2 inhibition with compound A11 did not. Furthermore, the TGF-\u03b2 induced inhibition of organoid formation was functionally restored in a concentration-dependent manner by both dual ROCK 1 and 2 inhibition and selective ROCK2 inhibition. We conclude that dual pharmacological inhibition of ROCK 1 and 2 counteracts TGF-\u03b2 induced effects on remodeling and alveolar epithelial progenitor function, suggesting this to be a promising therapeutic approach for respiratory diseases associated with fibrosis and defective lung repair.",

Transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 plays a major role in promoting myofibroblast differentiation. However, excessive and persistent TGF-\u03b2-induced myofibroblast differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) deposition contribute to pathological tissue remodeling that occurs in a broad range of lung diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (Grzela et al., 2016) , asthma (Fehrenbach et al., 2017) , and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) (King et al., 2011; Hirota and Martin, 2013; Ohgiya et al., 2017) . Myofibroblasts are contractile cells possessing morphologic and biochemical features that are intermediate between fibroblast and smooth muscle cells. These contractile fibroblasts secrete ECM proteins such as collagens, which are the most important load-bearing component of the parenchymal lung connective tissue, crucial for maintaining structural and mechanical organ functionality (El Agha et al., 2017) . Moreover, the differentiated myofibroblasts are characterized by enhanced expression of \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA) and other cytoskeletal proteins contributing to the contractile activity of these cells (Meng et al., 2016; Florian et al., 2019; Winters et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "As such, the persistent presence of myofibroblasts in disease may actually contribute to defective repair by airway and alveolar epithelial cells. Mesenchymal-epithelial interactions normally contribute to epithelial regeneration after injury, yet myofibroblasts are less effective in supporting epithelial repair (Demayo et al., 2002; Horowitz and Thannickal, 2006; Meng et al., 2016) . Previously, we reported that TGF-\u03b2-induced myofibroblast differentiation profoundly skews the canonical WNT/\u03b2-catenin signaling in human lung fibroblasts, and results in reduced secretion of factors that nurture epithelial repair such as FGF7, FGF10 and HGF (Ng-Blichfeldt et al., 2019) . Furthermore, TGF-\u03b2 increases the expression of WNT-5A and WNT-5B by myofibroblasts (Ng-Blichfeldt et al., 2019) , and such mesenchymal WNT-5A/5B signaling represses alveolar epithelial repair by inhibition of canonical WNT signaling (Wu et al., 2019a) . Currently, there are no pharmacological treatments available in the clinic that effectively prevent or reverse the aberrant TGF-\u03b2-induced changes in remodeling and lung repair.",

Two isoforms, ROCK1 and ROCK2, were described as being part of this family of RhoA-GTP interacting proteins. Several studies have revealed a diverse range of functions of ROCK1 and 2 in the context of lung diseases (Htwe et al., 2017) and ROCK inhibitors have potential therapeutic applicability in lung diseases such as asthma, COPD and pulmonary fibrosis (Hallgren et al., 2012; Vigil et al., 2012; Htwe et al., 2017; dos Santos et al., 2018; Knipe et al., 2018) . A recent study also showed that the gene expression of both ROCK1 and ROCK2 were increased in the lungs of the patients who died from Covid-19 (Ackermann et al., 2020) . Pharmacological inhibition of ROCK using ROCK inhibitors has been shown to prevent airway remodeling and lung fibrosis in animal models (Qi et al., 2015; Knipe et al., 2018) . Fasudil, a classic non-selective ROCK inhibitor and vasodilator approved in Japan for the treatment of brain vessel vasospasm induced by subarachnoid haemorrhage, is reported playing protective roles in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in animal models (Jiang et al., 2012) ; however, its clinical applications are limited by the modest ROCK inhibition efficacy and poor selectivity (Tumbarello and Turner, 2006; Hallgren et al., 2012; Pireddu et al., 2012; Rath and Olson, 2012; Vigil et al., 2012; Xueyang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018) .",

To fill this gap, we have selected from existing patents two potent ROCKinhibitors: compound 31, a dual ROCK1 and ROCK2 inhibitor, and compound A11, a ROCK2 selective inhibitor. We then evaluated their efficacies in three in vitro models to identify their potential in restoring TGF-\u03b2-induced changes in myofibroblast differentiation and impaired alveolar epithelial progenitor cell function. Our results show that dual ROCK1 and 2 inhibition prevents myofibroblast differentiation and ECM deposition induced by TGF-\u03b2 in lung fibroblasts and PCLS, whereas ROCK2 selective inhibition did not. Furthermore, our results reveal that dual ROCK1/2 and ROCK2 inhibition restores the defective TGF-\u03b2-induced changes in mesenchymal-epithelial progenitor interactions during organoid formation, suggesting ROCK inhibition as a promising therapeutic target for pulmonary diseases characterized by defective lung repair.",

Cultures were maintained in DMEM/F12 with 5% (v/v) FBS, 2 mM glutamine, antibiotics, insulin-transferrin-selenium (1x, Gibco #15290018), recombinant mouse EGF (0.025 \u03bcg/ml, Sigma #SRP3196), bovine pituitary extract (30 \u03bcg/ml, Sigma #P1476), and freshly added all-trans retinoic acid (0.01\u03bcM, Sigma #R2625) at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Media was refreshed every 2-3 days. The total number of organoids per well was counted manually 14 days after seeding using a light microscope at \u00d720 magnification. Organoid diameter was measured at the same day using a light microscope connected to NIS-Elements software. Thereafter, organoid cultures were fixed for immunofluorescence. After washing three times with PBS, the coverslips were transferred onto glass slides and were mounted by mounting medium contains DAPI (Abcam #ab104139). Organoid were fixed within ice-cold acetone/methanol (1:1) medium for 15 min at \u221220\u00b0C, then were blocked in PBS, supplemented with 5% BSA Ng-Blichfeldt et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019a) . Cultures were incubated with primary antibodies Rb anti-pro-surfactant protein C (pro-SPC, Millipore AB3786) and mouse anti-acetylated tubulin (ACT, Santa Cruz sc-23950) diluted 1:200 in PBS with 0.1% BSA and 0.1% Triton-X100 at 4\u00b0C overnight. Thereafter, cultures were washed 3 times in PBS (>1 h between washes) and incubated with secondary antibodies donkey anti-rabbit (Jackson Immunoresearch, 711-165-152) and donkey antimouse (Jackson Immunoresearch, 711-165-152) diluted 1: 200 at room temperature for 2.5 h. Cultures were excised from inserts and mounted on glass slides with mounting media containing DAPI (Abcam #ab104139) and glass coverslips.",

To investigate whether the novel ROCK inhibitors are able to restore the defective organoid formation, we designed the organoid assay as shown in Figure 4A . Murine CCL206 lung fibroblasts were Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org January 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 609509 5 differentiated into myofibroblasts by TGF-\u03b2 (2 ng/ml) in the absence or presence of compound 31/compound A11 for 24 h. Afterward, the pretreated fibroblasts were extensively washed to remove the stimuli and co-cultured with freshly isolated mouse lung epithelial cells (CD31 -/CD45 -/EpCAM + cells). Myofibroblast differentiation with TGF-\u03b2 reduced the number of epithelial organoids formed at day 14, in line with our previous findings (12). Both compound 31 and compound A11 were able to restore the reduced numbers of organoids in a concentration-dependent manner to levels seen in the control cultures ( Figures 4C, D) . TGF-\u03b2 induced myofibroblast differentiation had no impact on the median diameter of the organoids formed ( Figures 4E, F) . In combination with compound A11, however, the median diameter was slightly decreased by 1 \u00b5M yet increased by 10 \u00b5M compound compared to TGF-\u03b2 stimulation alone ( Figure 4F ). Myofibroblast differentiation with TGF-\u03b2 significantly reduced the proportion of alveolar (proSPC + /ACT \u2212 ) organoids yet increased the proportion of airway organoids (proSPC \u2212 /ACT + ) quantified after immunofluorescence staining (Figures 4G-I) . This was partially restored by dual ROCK1/2 inhibition with compound 31, whereas ROCK2 selective inhibition by compound A11 had no such effect (Figures 4H, I) . As the main effect of ROCK inhibition on the fibroblast was to reduce \u03b1-sm-actin expression and stress fiber formation (Figure 2) , we also investigated the role of stress fiber formation in itself on the ability of fibroblasts to support organoid formation. Pretreatment of fibroblasts with jasplakinolide, a compound that restricts mobility by promoting actin polymerization, appeared sufficient to mimic the effect of TGF-\u03b2 ( Figure 4J) . Interestingly, we spotted direct cell-cell contact between fibroblasts and developing epithelial organoids in the assay ( Figure 4K ). This is consistent with our observation that in our lung organoid cultures, direct contact of fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells is essential for organoid growth. Thus, organoids only form if fibroblasts and epithelial progenitors are in direct contact within the Matrigel. Organoids do not form if fibroblasts are cultured on the adjacent bottom chamber or if conditioned media of fibroblasts is used, confirming the essential role of fibroblasts in alveolar organoid formation (Supplementary Figure S1 ).",

Thus, we investigated whether ROCK inhibition may impact on the expression of these secreted factors. We focused these studies on compound 31 as this compound had the strongest impact on reversing the TGF-\u03b2 effects throughout this study. We examined the mRNA expression level of several key components of WNT signaling and FGF signaling pathways, which play an important role in tissue regeneration. Intriguingly, TGF-\u03b2 increased the mRNA level of WNT-5A (p < 0.05) and WNT-2B in MRC5 fibroblasts but had no influence on AXIN2 (Figures 5A-C) expression. When compound 31 was added, the increased expression of those WNT ligands was normalized in a concentrationdependent manner (Figures 5A-C) . Moreover, TGF-\u03b2 stimulation increased FGF2 mRNA expression and decreased FGF-7 and HGF expression ( Figures 5D-F) . Compound 31 reduced FGF2 expression and restored FGF7 and HGF expression in a concentration-dependent manner ( Figure 5D-F) . Thus, TGF-\u03b2 activation in fibroblasts distorts the mesenchymal-epithelial interactions via WNT signaling and FGF signaling pathways, which was reversed by dual ROCK 1/2 inhibition.",

            "text": "A better understanding of the mechanisms that regulate phenotype and function of lung (myo)fibroblasts may lead to the identification of therapeutic targets. TGF-\u03b2 is a master regulator of myofibroblast differentiation in fibrosis, as evident from several in vitro and in vivo studies (Meng et al., 2016; Nagai et al., 2019; Ng-Blichfeldt et al., 2019; Noe et al., 2019; Saidi et al., 2019) . In this study, we investigated the potential of two novel ROCK inhibitors with different selectivity against two ROCK isoforms in counteracting TGF-\u03b2 induced effects on myofibroblast differentiation and alveolar epithelial progenitor organoid formation. Interactions between pulmonary fibroblasts and epithelial cells not only contributes to homeostasis but also to Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org January 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 609509 lung repair in many pathological conditions (Demayo et al., 2002; Horowitz and Thannickal, 2006; Hirota and Martin, 2013; El Agha et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019a; Ng-Blichfeldt et al., 2019; Noe et al., 2019; Zepp and Morrisey, 2019) . We previously showed (Ng-Blichfeldt et al., 2019) that this interaction is disturbed if fibroblasts are transdifferentiated into myofibroblasts by TGF-\u03b2. A reduction in SPC + alveolar organoids was observed after TGF-\u03b2 treatment and an increase in the number of ACT + airway organoids. ROCK 1 and ROCK 2 inhibition was able to restore the reduced organoid formation in response to TGF-\u03b2 in current study and dual inhibition partially restored the number of SPC + alveolar organoids, whereas selective ROCK2 inhibition did not. We propose two mechanistic explanations for this TGF-\u03b2 effect, being restriction of fibroblast motility and alterations in secreted factors, both of which are normalized by dual ROCK1/2 inhibition. Indeed, fibroblasts are needed in co-culture with Frontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org January 2021 | Volume 11 | Article 609509 8 epithelial cells in order to form organoids and organoids form only if fibroblasts are in direct cell-cell contact. We speculated that fibroblast motility is required for this effect. TGF-\u03b2 restricts fibroblast motility by increasing \u03b1-sm-actin stress fibers. In support, we show that dual ROCK1/2 inhibition can inhibit both the stress fiber formation and the reduced organoid numbers in response to TGF-\u03b2. Furthermore, pretreatment of fibroblasts with jasplakinolide, which restricts fibroblast mobility by inducing \u03b1-sm-actin stress fiber formation, is sufficient to disturb the organoid formation to a similar extent as TGF-\u03b2 (Ng-Blichfeldt et al., 2019) .",

            "text": "In the past 2 decades, the development of pharmacological ROCK inhibitors has gained increasing interest; however, in the majority of published studies classic ROCK inhibitors, such as Y27632 and (hydroxy) fasudil, both of which target the ATPdependent kinase domain of ROCK1 and ROCK2, are utilized. The two ROCK isoforms, ROCK1 and ROCK2, are structurally similar sharing \u223c60% overall amino acid identity, and within the N-terminal kinase domain, they are \u223c90% homologous. Accordingly, the design of isoform selective inhibitors has until now been very challenging. Unfortunately, both these first generation ROCK inhibitors have poor ROCK inhibition potency, and are additionally unselective against a range of other kinases, especially those in the AGC family (Tumbarello and Turner, 2006; Hallgren et al., 2012; Pireddu et al., 2012; Rath and Olson, 2012; Vigil et al., 2012; Xueyang et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2018; Cantoni et al., 2019) . To fill this gap, we selected, as tool compounds, two ROCK inhibitors previously described in two distinct patents, a ROCK 1 and 2 inhibitor (compound 31), and a ROCK2 selective inhibitor (compound A11). Our results show that they elicit non-identical effects in TGF-\u03b2-induced remodeling. We show an increase of \u03b1-SMA expression in TGF\u03b2 activated human fibroblasts and the murine PCLS, and only compound 31 was able to downregulate the contractile marker expression in both models, indicating that dual ROCK 1/2 inhibition is necessary for preventing contractile activity in pulmonary fibroblasts. A recent study (Knipe et al., 2018) using genetic ROCK inhibition showed that there is no significant decrease in \u03b1-SMA expression with individual ROCK1 or ROCK2 knockdown as compared with nontargeting siRNA in response to TGF-\u03b2, however, they showed a reduction of \u03b1-SMA expression when ROCK1 and ROCK2 were simultaneously knocked down. Together, this indicates that dual ROCK1 and ROCK2 inhibition profoundly attenuates the contractility of fibroblasts. Interestingly, we found dual ROCK1 and ROCK2 inhibition prevented the synthesis of collagen expression induced by TGF\u03b2, however, ROCK2 inhibition tended to enhance it, suggesting the activity of each ROCK isoform may play counteractive roles in response to TGF-\u03b2 signaling. Knipe R.S., et al., also observed a reduction in collagen expression with the knockdown of ROCK1 or with both isoforms in response to TGF-\u03b2 (Knipe et al., 2018) . Additionally, Yu Zhang, et al., showed that ROCK2-siRNA on TGF-\u03b2-stimulated ARE luciferase reporter expression was blocked by co-expression of ROCK2; and the inhibition of human ROCK2 overexpression in response to TGF-\u03b2 was blocked in the presence of ROCK kinase inhibitor Y27632 in human liver cells, suggesting that ROCK2 acts as a negative regulator of the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway (Zhang et al., 2009) .",

            "text": "Furthermore, functional alterations in the FGF signaling pathway were observed. Fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) are members of the heparin-binding growth factor family that are often involved in morphogenesis and wound repair and FGF signaling dysregulations is implicated in many disorders (Ornitz and Itoh, 2015; Fehrenbach et al., 2017; Ohgiya et al., 2017; Plikus et al., 2017; Shiraishi et al., 2019; Weiner et al., 2019) . FGF2 has attracted increasing attention in lung biology recently and is reported as an important factor in airway remodeling by increasing the deposition of proteoglycans resulting in bronchial hyperresponsiveness in asthmatic airways (Kim et al., 2018) . FGF10, a member of the FGF7-subfamily, is widely reported as a primary regulator for branching morphogenesis, cellular differentiation, and response to injury (Prince, 2018; Weiner et al., 2019; Zepp and Morrisey, 2019) . We reported previously that mesenchymal FGF7, HGF, and FGF10 support alveolar organoid growth, and exogenous FGF7 and HGF rescue TGF\u03b2-induced reduction in organoid number when added to the organoid culture. Our transcriptional analysis also showed that TGF-\u03b2 upregulated the expression of FGF2 but downregulated the expression of FGF10 and HGF in human fibroblasts and compound 31 counteracts TGF-\u03b2 effects. Additionally, a recent publication showed that the gene expression of Col1\u03b11, FN1, FGF2 and HGF were all increased in lungs of the patients who died from Covid-19 (Ackermann et al., 2020) , genes that are all TGF-\u03b2 responsive, yet inhibited by dual ROCK1/2 as we show in this study. Taken together, these results suggest that TGF-\u03b2 elicits modifications of contractility and secreted factors in fibroblasts, and ROCK 1 and 2 inhibition is able to counteract such effects.",

            "text": "According to the human lung cell atlas (https://asthma. cellgeni.sanger.ac.uk/) (Schiller et al., 2019) and the IPF lung cell atlas (http://www.ipfcellatlas.com/) (Adams et al., 2019) , the expression of ROCK1 is much higher than ROCK2 in both pulmonary epithelial cells and stromal cells (Supplementary Figure S2) . Interestingly, ROCK1 increased in (myo)fibroblasts in response to IPF pathology, however, ROCK2 shows opposite alterations in fibroblasts and myofibroblasts (Supplementary Figure S3) . These data suggest that the role of ROCK1 in IPF pathology (at least at transcriptomic level) might be more profound as compared to that of ROCK2 and might explain why the protective effect of dual ROCK1/2 inhibition is more profound than ROCK2 selective inhibition in the current study. In further support of this contention, the level of ROCK1 has been demonstrated to function as a clinical progression marker for IPF (Park et al., 2014; Knipe et al., 2016) . This is consistent with our functional studies showing that ROCK2 selective inhibition is less effective than ROCK1/2 inhibition. An earlier study (Hallgren et al., 2012) showed that fibroblasts isolated from the parenchyma of severe COPD patients that have more contractile phenotypes are associated with enhanced ROCK1 expression, and the ROCK inhibitor Y27632 blocked this contraction. Thus, it would be interesting to evaluate the effect of selective pharmacological inhibition of ROCK1 in future studies; unfortunately, ROCK1 selective inhibitors are currently not available. Giving the structural similarity between ROCK1 and ROCK2, there are no immediate structural features that can be exploited to design ROCK1 selective inhibitors, while in case of ROCK2, the optimization of van der Waals contacts between the more flexible glycine rich loop and the portion of the molecule underneath P-loop can favor selectivity. However, it is hard to use these observations to guide the design of a ROCK1 selective inhibitor. In addition, hypotensive effects of systemic ROCK inhibition appear to be associated mainly with ROCK1 and this may have driven for discovery of ROCK2 selective inhibitors as safer drugs. Since ROCK1 isoform-selective inhibitors are not currently available, additional studies using genetic approach to specifically delete ROCK1 or ROCK2 will be necessary to elucidate specific roles of these two isoforms in the development of pulmonary remodeling and repair. Such studies will be needed to determine whether an inhibitor for either ROCK1 or ROCK2 may be as effective as a nonselective inhibitor and may be better tolerated.",

Total RNA was extracted form MRC5 fibroblasts using the TRIzol method. RNA concentrations were determined using a ND-1000 spectrophotometer and equal amounts of total mRNA were then reverse transcribed (Promega, Madison, United States 0). The cDNA was subjected to real-time qPCR (Westburg, Leusden, The Netherlands) using SYBR green as the DNA binding dye (Roche Applied Science, Mannheim, Germany) on an Illumina Eco Real-Time PCR system (Westburg, Leusden, the Netherlands), with denaturation at 94\u00b0C for 30 s, annealing at 59\u00b0C for 30 s and extension at 72\u00b0C for 30 s for 40 cycles followed by 10 min at 72\u00b0C. Real-time qPCR data were analyzed using LinRegPCR analysis software and the amount of target gene was normalized to the endogenous reference gene 18S ribosomal RNA for mouse PCLS and to SDHA for human fibroblasts. The specific forward and reverse primers used are listed inSupplementary Table S1.MRC5 fibroblasts were cultured on the coverslips within the culture plate to perform immunofluorescence experiments. Cells were washed twice with PBS and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 10 min at RT. Then cells were washed again twice with PBS and were incubated with Alxea Fluor \u2122 488 Phalloidin (ThermoFisher, A12379) 1:40 diluted in PBS for 20 min at RT.",
