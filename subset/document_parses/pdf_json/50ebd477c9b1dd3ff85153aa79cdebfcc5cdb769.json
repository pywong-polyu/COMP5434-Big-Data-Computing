            "text": "Selection to the health professions remains a contentious issue internationally. The updated Ottawa consensus statement on selection and recruitment to the healthcare professions 1 reported a growing evidence-based approach to selection. It also noted conflicting drivers around diversity, differential attainment, retention and institutional aspirations. Similar conflicts have been reported in dental student selection. 2 In the UK, there is a growing evidence base around medical student selection, but few papers examine dental selection closely. 3, 4 Existing literature suggests that conflict might exist during dental student selection when aspirations to widen access to the profession are enacted by using admission tests. 3 Evidence to support the predictive validity of dental selection tools is limited but there is tentative evidence of a small but significant relationship between the University Clinical Aptitude Test (UCAT) and assessment outcome 2,5 and although weak, there is a relationship between UCAT scores and medical school assessments. 3 The selection of students for entry to UK dental schools has traditionally followed a consistent process: an initial assessment of academic qualifications, the assessment of qualities obtained from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) application form (personal statements and references) and an interview. Once this process is completed, dental schools then make offer decisions. While selection processes remain at the discretion of individual universities, this approach remains similar across all dental schools in the UK. 4 In 2005, a collaboration between 23 medical schools and 8 dental schools led to the development of the United Kingdom Clinical Aptitude Test (UKCAT) (www.ucat.ac.uk). International collaboration in 2019 led to the test being used in Australia and New Zealand and following this expansion UKCAT changed its name to UCAT. In the UK 30 medical schools and 14 dental schools now use the UCAT as part of their selection processes for undergraduate programmes.",

In 2013, the UCAT Situational Judgement Test (SJT) component of the test was introduced with candidates' performance allocated to one of four bands; Band 1 being allocated to the highest performing candidates. The Decision Analysis subtest was replaced by a Decision Making subtest in 2017 and reflected a desire by the UCAT Consortium to test a broader range of decision-making traits within the test. The UCAT cognitive test scores have, since inception, provided a standardised tool that dental schools could use in student selection. 5 As highlighted above, the consortium formed from UCAT members has enabled participating schools to develop and determine how best to use the test, the consortium being informed annually regarding test content, scoring and statistical performance of the test. 6 This paper describes changes and trends in the use of UCAT scores in dental selection by UK dental schools from 2011-2019. It follows a similar but not identical approach to a recent review of the use of UCAT scores in medicine. 7",

It was believed that cognitive ability, as well as academic potential, should be evaluated if doctors and dentists with traits felt desirable to the profession were to be recruited. The UCAT is now firmly embedded as an admission tool and now represents a significant factor in assisting selection to dentistry programmes in the UK and is used by all but two universities for entry to undergraduate dental training. The two non-UCAT schools are Leeds (who use the BioMedical Admissions Test in selection) and University of Central Lancashire (who do not utilise an admissions test for entry to their graduate entry programme).",

Even in cases where the UCAT factor is relatively low, UCAT scores are likely to have an impact given the ceiling effect of high academic grades required by universities. In the early years of the UCAT Consortium, there was some reluctance on the part of dental schools to use the test too strongly and a cautious, watchful approach was applied. Since 2011, there has been a shift to use the test more robustly in dental student selection, most notably as a factor method to identify those suitable for interview. In 2019, eight schools used the test in this way; on average, UCAT was weighted to contribute a value of around 30% in selection decisions.",

Such strong drivers have not significantly influenced dental student selection, possibly because competition has been traditionally lower than for medicine. In addition, political attention around widening access though purportedly relating to all the professions has tended to focus on medicine. While dentistry (anecdotally) can claim to have greater ethnic diversity in applications, widening access in terms of socioeconomic status remains a challenge. 13 In the event of there being a greater focus in the future on widening access in dental selection, this might lead to further changes in selection processes. While the test may be less sensitive to some measures of socioeconomics than school leaver qualifications, 14 there is no evidence (to date) of it reducing disadvantage in medical selection. 15 This is perhaps acknowledged by those schools adjusting UCAT requirements (usually alongside school leaver requirements) for these applicants.",
