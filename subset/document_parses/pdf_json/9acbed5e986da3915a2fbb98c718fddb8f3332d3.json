Remdesivir was previously under development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease in the wake of the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa. While it was a promising therapeutic agent for Ebola virus disease in preclinical studies [4] , monoclonal antibodies outperformed remdesivir in a phase III clinical trial [5] and remdesivir is no longer being developed in this indication. The antiviral activity of remdesivir against coronaviruses, however, has rendered the drug of great interest during the current global pandemic. The novel coronavirus disease 2019 , caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, was first reported in Wuhan, China, in December 2019 [6] . The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 January 2020 and a pandemic on 11 March 2020 [6] , spurring an international effort to rapidly identify treatments that might ease the burden on healthcare systems.",

Under its terms, Ligand Pharmaceuticals would supply Gilead with a uniquely modified cyclodextrin (Captisol \u00ae ), the chemical structure of which was rationally designed to optimize the solubility and stability of drugs including remdesivir [26] , for use in a Captisol-enabled program directed against Ebola virus disease (in addition to other programs, if expansions to the agreement were agreed by the companies) [25] . In turn, Ligand would receive an upfront Drug Master File reference fee, as well as commercial revenue from the shipment of Captisol to Gilead [25] . As of April 2020, Ligand is supplying Captisol to Gilead for use in clinical trials evaluating remdesivir in the treatment of COVID-19 [27] .",

Once remdesivir triphosphate has been mistakenly incorporated into the chain and a small number of subsequent nucleotides (typically three, in coronaviruses) have been added, RNA synthesis is terminated [29] [30] [31] [32] . Remdesivir has broad-spectrum antiviral activity against numerous viruses including Ebola virus, Nipah virus and respiratory syncytial virus, as well as endemic and zoonotic coronaviruses [1] [2] [3] [4] . In primary human airway epithelial cell cultures, remdesivir inhibited the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with submicromolar half-maximum inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values [3] .

This antiviral effect appears to be virus-specific; remdesivir is not cytotoxic at \u2264 10 \u03bcg in this culture system [3, 33] . In Vero E6 cells, EC 50 values of remdesivir and its metabolite GS-441524 against SARS-CoV-2 were 1.65 \u03bcM and 0.47 \u03bcM, respectively, reflecting the lower capacity of Vero E6 cells to metabolize remdesivir [33] . When clinically relevant concentrations of remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate were co-incubated in HEp-2 cells infected with respiratory syncytial virus, chloroquine phosphate dose-dependently antagonized the antiviral activity of remdesivir. With increasing concentrations of chloroquine phosphate, higher remdesivir EC 50 values and reduced remdesivir triphosphate formation in normal human bronchial epithelial cells were observed [18] . Consequently, the coadministration of remdesivir and chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulphate is not recommended [17, 18] .",

In patients with severe disease, time to recovery was 12 days with remdesivir and 18 days with placebo (rate ratio 1.37; 95% CI 1.15-1.63); there was no significant treatment difference for patients with mild/ moderate disease (time to recovery 5 days in each group) [18] .

Patients were within 12 days of symptom onset at enrolment. Patients were randomized to either intravenous remdesivir (single daily infusions of 200 mg on day 1 and 100 mg on days 2-10; n = 158 enrolled) or volume-matched placebo infusions (n = 79). Clinical improvement was defined as a two-point reduction on a six-point ordinal scale of clinical status or live discharge from hospital (whichever was earlier) within 28 days of randomization. It should be noted that this study was underpowered (statistical power reduced from 80% to 58%), not reaching its target enrolment due to control of the outbreak in the region [42] .",
