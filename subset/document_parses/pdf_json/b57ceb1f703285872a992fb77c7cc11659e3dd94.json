Variation in individual susceptibility or exposure to infection exacerbates this effect. Individuals that are more susceptible or more exposed tend to be infected earlier, depleting the susceptible 25 subpopulation of those who are at higher risk of infection. This selective depletion of susceptibles intensifies the deceleration in incidence. Eventually, susceptible numbers become low enough to prevent epidemic growth or, in other words, the herd immunity threshold (HIT) is reached. Although estimates vary, simple calculations suggest that herd immunity to SARS-CoV-2 requires 60-70% of the population to be immune. By fitting epidemiological models that 30 allow for heterogeneity to SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks across the globe, we show that variation in susceptibility or exposure to infection reduces these estimates. Accurate measurements of heterogeneity are therefore of paramount importance in controlling the COVID-19 pandemic.",

As of 06 May 2020, more than 3.5 million cases have been confirmed and almost 250,000 died (1) . Scientists throughout the world have engaged with governments, health agencies, and with each other, to address this emergency. Mathematical models have been central to important decisions 5 concerning contact tracing, quarantine, and social distancing, to mitigate or suppress the initial pandemic spread (2) . Successful suppression, however, leaves populations at risk to resurgent waves due to insufficient acquisition of immunity. Models have thus also addressed longer term SARS-CoV-2 transmission scenarios and the requirements for continued adequate response (3) . This is especially timely as countries begin to relax lockdown measures that have been in place 10 over recent weeks with varying levels of success in tackling national outbreaks.",

More susceptible and more connected individuals have a higher propensity to be infected and thus are likely to become immune earlier. Due to this selective immunization, heterogeneous 15 populations require less infections to cross their herd immunity thresholds (HITs) than homogeneous (or not sufficiently heterogeneous) models would suggest. We integrate continuous distributions of susceptibility or connectivity in otherwise basic epidemic models for COVID-19 and show that as the coefficient of variation (CV) increases from 0 to 4, the herd immunity threshold declines from over 60% (4, 5) to less than 10%. Measures of individual 20 variation are urgently needed to narrow the estimated ranges of HITs and plan accordingly.",

Selection results in the removal of the most at-risk individuals 10 from the susceptible pool as they become infected and eventually recover (some die). This selective acquisition of infection and immunity results simultaneously in decelerated epidemic growth and accelerated induction of immunity in the population. The herd immunity threshold (HIT) defines the percentage of the population that needs to be immune to reverse epidemic growth and prevent future waves. Figure 3 shows the expected downward trends in the HIT for 15 SARS-CoV-2 as the coefficients of variation of the gamma distributed susceptibility or exposure are increased between 0 and 4 (to assess robustness to changing the type of distribution see Figure S22 for equivalent plots with lognormal distributions). While herd immunity is expected to require 60-70% of a homogeneous population to be immune given an ! between 2.5 and 3, these percentages drop to the range 10-20% for CVs between 2 and 4. Therefore, a critically 20 important question is: how variable are humans in their susceptibility and exposure to SARS-CoV-2? Hitherto, there is no definite answer to this question.

Defining the percentage of the population that must be immune to cause infection incidences to decline, herd immunity thresholds constitute convenient targets for vaccination coverage. In idealized scenarios of vaccines delivered at random and individuals mixing at random, herd 25 immunity thresholds are given by a simple formula (1 \u2212 1 ! \u2044 ) which, in the case of SARS-CoV-2, suggests that 60-70% of the population would need be immunized to halt spread considering estimates of ! between 2.5 and 3. A crucial caveat in exporting these calculations to immunization by natural infection is that natural infection does not occur at random. Individuals who are more susceptible or more exposed are more prone to be infected and become 30 immune, which lowers the threshold (14) . In our model, the herd immunity threshold declines sharply when coefficients of variation increase from 0 to 2 and remains below 20% for more variable populations. The amplitude of the decline depends on what property is heterogeneous and how it is distributed but the downwards trend is robust (Figures 3 and S22) .",

Seroprevalences estimated from various settings are currently widespread, but reportedly between less than 1 and just over 20%, including estimates from Kobe, Japan (3.3%) (21) and Guilan province, Iran (22%) (22). While seropositivity estimates 25 are limited by epidemiological context and current estimates are undoubtedly affected by testing uncertainties, our results suggest that some estimated values may be closer to reaching herd immunity thresholds than otherwise predicted, if populations were sufficiently heterogeneous. Worth nothing, however, that these estimates may have been offset by the social distancing measures. 30 Given current uncertainties, a high level of pragmatism may be required in incorporating results from serological surveys into policy decisions. We have assumed that infection elicits persistent adaptive immunity. This assumption is justified by encouraging reports on animal models and humans recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, even though volatile immunity has not been ruled out yet. Our results are robust as long as recovered individuals remain immune for several 35 months. Any test that allows for retrospectively detecting past infections is therefore a convenient tool for monitoring the prevalence and distribution of individuals who may have acquired immunity. It would be imperative to conduct repeated serological studies in representative samples of the population (23) especially as control measures are relaxed, not necessarily to imply that antibodies themselves are neutralizing but to identify past infection and 40 potential for immune protection. Given a percent positivity in an initial survey, the curve traced by subsequent measurements could indicate if and how rapidly a population is moving towards the herd immunity threshold, and simultaneously advise which control measures should be enforced.",
