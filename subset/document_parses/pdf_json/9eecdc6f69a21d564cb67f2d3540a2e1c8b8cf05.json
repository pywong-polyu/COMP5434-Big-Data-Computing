The main adverse outcomes of COVID-19 infection are precipitated by a severe viral pneumonitis, which in turn may lead to direct respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome, pro-thrombotic coagulation dysfunction, secondary sepsis, refractory metabolic acidosis, and eventual multiorgan failure with a fatality rate of up to 3.5% [2, 3, 9] .",

Virions can be detected for up to 3 h after aerosolization and up to 3-4 days on surfaces [13] . Upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy procedures are recognized to be aerosol-generating procedures (AGP) and endoscopy staff are therefore considered to be also at an increased risk of infection through this route [1, 4, 6, [14] [15] [16] . During lower GI endoscopic procedures, transmission to staff could also potentially occur through inadvertent contact/splashing with contaminated fecal droplets [12] . For this reason, national and international GI societies/organizations issued rapid guidelines [15] [16] [17] [18] during the pandemic peak. The main universal recommendation was for endoscopy services to strictly limit their activity to emergency or non-deferrable procedures, while postponing all elective and non-urgent endoscopic procedures [15, 16] . The rationale behind these recommendations was: (i) to decrease the potential risk of infection to both patients and staff [19] ; and (ii) to allow redeployment of both medical and nursing members of the endoscopy team to areas of the institution where they were needed most-i.e., for the care of the everincreasing number of inpatients with COVID-19 infection on our wards and in the intensive care unit (ICU).",

Furthermore, analysis of our projected figures shows that the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may have even more severe repercussions for future hospital activity and economics, as we aim to recuperate any canceled or postponed activity. In addition, the potential wide-ranging repercussions of delay in cancer care and other pathologies are still not fully understood, and studies to shed further light on them are required.",
