Seroprevalence rates were low in children aged \u226412 years 130 despite close contact, and similar to observations from other European countries with comparable 131 nationwide estimates [1, 9] . Interestingly, the likelihood of infection among persons in close contact 132 with children was not statistically significantly increased, most likely indicating a low contribution in 133 transmission, as suggested previously [10] [11] [12] [13] . On the other hand, particularly young adults, who 134 engage in relatively more social interaction as opposed to older age groups [14] and often living in 135 larger (student) households, most probably play an increased role. Applying physical distancing 136 measures within households may not always be feasible, however stressing its relevance in outbreak 137 management could help to reduce (ongoing) transmission.

The risk factor analyses in the main text use logistic regression based on binary classification of the data (seronegative versus seropositive). Here, we also provide an underpinning of this classification using a twocomponent mixture model. In this model, samples are not rigidly classified as either seronegative or seropositive, but belong to either the negative or positive component with certain probability [1, 2] . As the probability of seropositivity may depend on age, we model the mixing parameter (i.e. the probability of seropositivity, or seroprevalence) with an age-dependent penalized spline [3] . We fit the model to antibody concentration measurements from the population sample described in the main text while incorporating information from a test panel of proven negative and positive samples [4] . Subsequently, we derive test characteristics (sensitivity, specificity) for various cut-offs, showing that the binary classification used in the main text performs well. In a final step we present additional results for the weighted seropositivity estimates by municipal health services, and for the age-specific odds of seropositivity.",

Here, the probability of infection calculated as the estimated positive density (at a certain concentration) divided by the sum of the positive and negative densities (at that concentration) [1] .

Technically, both sensitivity and specificity are calculated using cumulative density functions of the negative (specificity) and positive distributions (sensitivity) [1] . Figure S6 In Table S3 we show test characteristics for two specific scenarios. The first takes cut-offs that maximize the Youden index. Here, the estimated optimal cut-off is -0.56 (95%CrI: -0.67--0.44) and the estimated maximal Youden index is 0.97 (94%CrI: 0.95-0.98). This cut-off, however, is not useful in practice as expected seroprevalence is low (< 10%), and control of the false positive rate is more important than control of the false negative rate. Therefore, in a second scenario we aimed at a specificity of 0.999. Such specificity can be reached with the test, at a cut-off of 0.04 and a sensitivity of 0.943 (which is really good for such specificity!). In the following and in the main text we have opted for a cut-off of 0.04. Finally, Figure S8 shows the posterior distribution of test sensitivity at a cutoff of 0.04 (log(AU)/mL). Mean and standard deviation of the distribution are 0.942 and 0.0151, respectively. These values can be incorporated in Rogan-Gladen-type corrections for estimating true prevalence from observed apparent prevalence in binary classification [10, 11] . ",
