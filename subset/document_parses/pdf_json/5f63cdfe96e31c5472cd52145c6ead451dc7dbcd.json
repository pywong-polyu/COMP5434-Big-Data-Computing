Fewer were settled in the southern region of Europe, such as Spain (1193), Italy (413) and Portugal (879) [3] . Since 2015, the UKhas resettled over 25,000 refugees [4] , 19 ,768 of the most vulnerable were resettled under the Vulnerable Persons Resettlement Scheme (VPRS) [5] . Resettlement priority for the UK is based on the urgency of security and/or medical needswith additional priority to women and children that are at risk of violence or exploitation or with family links in the UK [6] . Most schemes offer Leave to Remain residency for five years, with Gateway providing Indefinite Leave to Remain [5, 6] . The UNHCR provides an out of country assessment for each application to determine their eligibility and refugee status [6] . Cases eligible for the UK resettlement schemes are forwarded to the Home Office who determine if the refugee meets their criteria. 2 of 11 For refugees accepted on a UK resettlement scheme they have a pre-departure medical health assessment (MHA). The MHA is administered by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) on behalf of the Home Office. The MHA is shared with local government through a Health Information System (HIS) process that uses a secure platform. The IOM's MHA is similar to 80 other countries' pre-departure assessment [7] . Therefore, the findings from this study could be applicable to international refugee resettlement.",
