Patients and methods In this non-interventional retrospective study, carried out at a tertiary hospital within the Spanish National Health System, all adult patients who were admitted in the Orthopaedic Surgery and Traumatology Department between March 9th and May 4th, 2020, were included. Clinical, biological and radiological data, as well as mortality rates, were collected from hospital medical records. Results A total of 293 periods of hospitalization were analysed in 288 patients. Mean age was 66.1 years old and 57.3% were females. Nineteen patients (6.48%) met the inclusion criteria to be categorized as a nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2. In a comparison between patients with and without nosocomial infection, age, mortality and hospital length of stay were statistically significant (p < 0.05). The median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in our cohort was 16 days (6-86 days). No statistically significant differences were found in sex, living situation, reason of admission or period of admission (even if we observed that most of the nosocomial infections (78.9%) occurred in March). Conclusion We have found a 6.48% of nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2, but with an important reduction of it after undergoing preventing protocols that included screening RT-PCR test for COVID-19. Age and hospital length stay were statistically significant risk factors for nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2. For the progressive restoration of the surgical activity, we recommend to correctly select the patients in elective surgery and to encourage fast-track programs and early discharge of patients with fractures.",

Spain was one of the first European countries to deal with this virus outbreak, declaring the State of Alarm on March 14th, 2020. This State of Alarm had several consequences on the Spanish population, imposing restrictions mainly in the free circulation of people and educational activity. People were allowed to move around public spaces only in very specific cases, like buying food or medicines, and all educational activities were cancelled [1] .",

However, as one of the trauma care centre referrals in Spain, covering a catchment area of more than 550,000 inhabitants, medical assistance was needed to supply to a considerable number of patients in this period. Special measures were adopted to minimize the risk of infection with COVID-19 for patients as well as for health professionals. Notwithstanding protective measures, the risk of contracting the virus during hospitalization period (or immediate outpatient care) did not appear to be unimportant, and the main clinical outcomes of the patients, such as early mortality, seemed to be magnified.",

To our knowledge, only two studies have reported the rate of nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2 between patients. Luong-Nguyen et al. reported a 4.9% (15/305) of nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2 in three different department of digestive surgery [2] . Vanhems et al. reported an infection rate of 20% among patients in a French geriatric unit [8] . Differences of these rates may be explained by the mean age of the patients analysed. Protective measures applied and early PCR test screening instauration may have also played an essential role to decrease nosocomial infection with COVID-19. In Luong-Nguyen et al., mean age of patients with COVID-19 nosocomial infection was 62 years old; meanwhile, in our study, the mean age was 78.3 years old. Vanhems et al. reported that the index case had 97 years old.",

Spain is currently expected to be the country with the most elderly population in the world by 2040 % percentage, n number, SD standard deviation, COPD chronic obstructive pulmonary disease *Values are given as the median (range) [9] .

In the present study, proximal femoral fracture was the most common reason for admission (33.8%). As the increase in the severity of COVID-19 with age is clearly studied [12] , protective measurements were applied universally in our department, but with special emphasis in elderlies.",

Until March 31st, at admission, an RT-PCR for COVID-19 was only requested if the patients had symptoms or had a pathological chest X-ray evaluated by a radiologist (Fig. 4) . Due to the increase of pandemic outbreak and looking after the protection of health workers, the protocol was improved. All patients admitted wore surgical mask and underwent an RT-PCR test for COVID-19. The positive effects of these measures were studied with the bivariate regression analyses, which did not find statistically significant differences between the patients hospitalized with COVID-19 in our institution and the risk of developing nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection in our department (OR 1.0; 95% CI: 0.998-1.002; p = 0.80).",

Hospital length of stay was a statistically significant risk factor for nosocomial infection with SARS-CoV-2 (p < 0.001). Luong-Nguyen et al. reported a median time from admission to diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection of 34 days (5-61 days). In their study, 12 patients (80%) were diagnosed % percentage, n number, SD standard deviation *Does not include proximal femoral fractures after a hospital length of stay greater than 14 days [2] . However, they only made a descriptive analysis of patients with nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection, with no comparison [2] . Due to the imminent restoration of the surgical activity, to understand modifiable risk factors of nosocomial SARS-CoV-2 infection becomes crucial for all surgery departments. As most of orthopaedic surgery is elective, pre-operative optimization of patients is more essential than ever [13] . Modifiable variables and correct selection of patients, as well as preventing protocols to restrict increases of hospital length stay, should be carefully evaluated. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 21,494,459 patients undergoing a knee arthroplasty, Shah et al. found that a pre-operative haemoglobin < 13.0 g/dL (95% CI = 0.34 to 0.98; p < 0.001) OR odds ratio, CI confidence interval was a risk factor for an increased hospital length of stay [14] . In a prospective study, Piuzzi et al. concluded that increased age, higher body mass index and greater Charlson Comorbidity Index were predictors of a longer hospital length of stay (p < 0.001) [15] . Notwithstanding, most studies have found that early discharge is not an independent risk factor for major complications or readmissions following arthroplasty [16, 17] . As well, programs for a rapid return to home in elderly patients who have undergone surgery for fractures have already demonstrated better results in terms of readmission rates, mobility and autonomy [18, 19] .",
