Here we investigate if and how individual responses to a shared threat reflect those patterns of ideological difference. In seeming contradiction to the general association between social conservatism and pathogen avoidance, the more socially conservative political party in the United States has more consistently downplayed the dangers of COVID-19 during the ongoing pandemic. This puzzle offers an opportunity to examine the contributions of multiple factors to disease avoidance. We investigated the relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautionary behavior in light of the partisan landscape of the United States. We explored whether consumption of, and attitudes toward, different sources of information, as well as differential evaluation of various threats caused by the pandemic -such as direct health costs versus indirect harms to the economy and individual liberties -shape partisan differences in responses to the pandemic in ways that overwhelm the contributions of social conservatism. In two pre-registered studies, socially conservative attitudes correlate with self-reported COVID-19 prophylactic behaviors, but only among Democrats. Reflecting larger societal divisions, among Republicans and Independents, the absence of a positive relationship between social conservatism and COVID-19 precautions appears driven by lower trust in scientists, lower trust in liberal and moderate sources, lesser consumption of liberal news media, and greater economic conservatism.",

Although case counts across most of the United States were relatively low compared to the subsequent fall and winter waves, the pandemic's effects were already widely felt. Many people adopted a suite of prophylactic behaviors, including mask wearing, social distancing, disinfecting, and social isolation to avoid infection. Many businesses, services, and schools were ordered closed in order to stem the spread of the pandemic. In turn, the effects of the pandemic and subsequent closures resulted in substantial economic decline, sparking political debate about both the cost-benefit trade-offs of COVID-19-related restrictions, as well as the nature and extent of economic relief measures. Notably, the pandemic was also heavily politicized [1] . In general, politicians from the Republican party and sympathetic media figures downplayed the direct health severity of the pandemic relative to their Democratic counterparts, while emphasizing the costs of closures and restrictions to both the economy and personal liberty.",

Here, in two studies conducted in the spring and summer of 2020, we explore the partisan patterns of U.S. responses to COVID-19 as a case study that challenges theoretical frameworks that link together political orientation, attitudes toward traditional norms, threat sensitivity, partisanship, and cost-benefit trade-off calculations between competing sources of threat.",

An emerging body of theory and research suggests that individual differences in social conservatism are associated with individual differences in threat sensitivity-the tendency to process threat-related cues as salient, attention-garnering, emotionally evocative, and behaviorally motivating. At an ultimate level, such an association could occur if, over historical and evolutionary timescales, traditional social norms reliably mitigated threats. As a consequence, at the proximate level, and potentially independently of conscious awareness, individuals who are more sensitive to the possibility of threats may assume that traditional and socially normative practices offer a form of precaution and threat management.",

First, specific traditions may actually provide direct protection against threats; cultural evolution may produce norms that instrumentally mitigate the costs of either specific threats, or certain domains of threat, including pathogens [8] . Individuals might explicitly recognize or implicitly assume the specific connections. However, because the functionality of norms is frequently opaque to adherents [9, 10] , hazards may be implicitly assumed to be addressed by endorsing traditions broadly, even in domains apparently unrelated to a given class of threats. This holds true so long as the frequency and magnitude of those instrumentally threat-mitigating traditions outweigh the potential costs of following non-instrumentally adaptive traditions as part of a wholesale commitment to traditions broadly (although traditions can have adaptive value outside of their instrumentality, see below).",

Variation in threat sensitivity may thus shape political behavior and party preferences in countries such as the U.S. [6, 14] , with higher threat sensitivity associated with both greater traditionalism and greater social conservatism. When considering associations between threat avoidance and socially conservative attitudes (encompassing both general attitudes toward traditions, and specific policy preferences that emphasize social continuity), it is important to distinguish distinct dimensions of political orientation. Social and economic conservatism reflect different ideological foci, where the former concerns attitudes toward social change, and the latter concerns attitudes toward fiscal policy [15] . Although these ideological dimensions sometimes cohere in contemporary political entities-such as the Republican party in the U.S. -the association may not be inherent. Assuming that social conservatism centers on maintaining the (real or imagined) practices of the past, while economic conservatism does not, the traditional-norms account laid out above privileges the former as the driver of the association between threat sensitivity and political ideology in general, implying that social conservatism should be more strongly related to threat avoidance than other forms of political ideology and related attitudes.",

Convergently, evolutionary modeling work has demonstrated that, at the group level, high degrees of objective threat favor the evolution of greater norm adherence [17] . However, the extent to which sensitivities to different categories of threats are associated with political ideology is contested [18] , and the volume of evidence varies by threat domain. Pathogen threat is one of the most extensively studied domains, and socially liberal, less traditional individuals have consistently been found to be less pathogen-avoidant than their conservative counterparts [19] [20] [21] . In sum, if greater threat sensitivity leads to upregulated threat-mitigation behaviors across different domains, then the general endorsement of traditions should tend to co-occur with other investments in threat mitigation such as pathogen avoidance behavior [19, 22] .",

Indeed, the possibility that temporal variation in threats results in conservative shifts is not mutually exclusive with the possibility that trait threat sensitivity influences social conservatism. Rather, both relationships may result from a shared underlying process that links threat to resistance to social change.",

Such measures present threat cues, offering participants some basis for estimating the costs of exposure to threats, and therefore the benefits of threat-avoidance, but generally leave unspecified the costs of avoiding the threats (e.g., opportunity costs, increased vulnerability to other threats, etc.). Thus, prior research [6, 19, 21, 27] has focused mostly on the benefits of threat avoidance, in turn limiting the ecological validity of the findings. Greater attention to costs is needed to more fully understand cost-benefit tradeoffs. Accordingly, recent work has started to address the effects of tradeoffs on threat and pathogen avoidance behaviors [28, 29] . In addition, the previously discussed empirical observations of conservative shifts in response to real-world threats likely implicitly summarize the cost-benefit trade-off calculations that individuals may be making.",

The COVID-19 pandemic involves a dangerous pathogen threat, one that is both highly salient for much of the world's population, and has had marked effects on real behavior. The extent to which variation in individuals' costly prophylactic responses associate with variation along the social and political dimensions discussed above may therefore illuminate the hypothesized relationship between socially conservative attitudes and threat sensitivity. Specifically, precautions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic may reflect threat sensitivity in the pathogen domain in light of the real-world trade-offs between different threat domains. Indeed, speaking to the possibility of these kinds of trade-offs, initial evidence suggests that individuals make COVID-19 precaution trade-offs with the mate-seeking domain [28] . Further, because reports of actual behavior summarize many of the implicit calculations being made by individuals, COVID-19 precautions plausibly more accurately reveal the intersection of baseline threat sensitivity and trade-offs among multiple threat domains than do questions about hypothetical cues of pathogen presence, generic items about danger, or broad statements regarding concern about the pandemic.",

Accordingly, two possibilities exist regarding the relationship between threat sensitivity, socially conservative attitudes, and COVID-19 precautions. On the one hand, if more threat-sensitive individuals focus on the danger posed by COVID-19 over and above the conflict with various traditions entailed by precautionary behaviors, then they will report both greater precautionary behavior and greater valuation of traditions than will less threat-sensitive individuals. On the other hand, highly threat-sensitive individuals may view such behaviors as threats in themselves, endangering individual liberties or economic prosperity.

Yet, in the U.S., the politicization of COVID-19 has resulted in supporters of the Republican party-despite being characterized by higher social conservatism and a stronger commitment to traditional cultural values [15, 35] -taking a more skeptical view of the danger posed by the disease [3] , enacting fewer real-life precautions [5] , and holding more negative attitudes toward precautions such as mask wearing [36] . This suggests either that the traditional-norms account is incorrect, or that other factors are influencing Republicans-either trade-offs with attempts to mitigate other threats, conflicts with traditions, or broader factors that are independent of threat mitigation per se. For example, different information environments-as a function of the types of media individuals consume, and the types of figures whom individuals trust-may relate to the specific threat cues that are experienced as most salient [37] .

Alternatively, individuals' media choices may reflect, rather than cause, abiding differences that drive potential variation in responses to the pandemic along partisan lines; our data will not adjudicate between these possibilities.",

Republicans and Democrats differ, on average, along multiple demographic dimensions, including ethnicity, gender, age, and education; they also live in regions differing in population density, creating differences in opportunities for disease transmission [44] .

If disgust sensitivity is an emotion-potentiating mechanism for motivating some pathogen avoidance behaviors, then it should positively correlate with actual prophylaxis.

Because disgust proximately motivates pathogen avoidance, disgust sensitivity measures may statistically account for the relationship between socially conservative attitudes and COVID-19 behaviors.

We then ran two studies using identical methods 43 days apart; these conceptually replicated and extended the principal results of the pilot. Study 2 tested the replicability of Study 1, particularly given changes in the pandemic that could affect relationships between American political attitudes and precautionary behavior.

Further, political ideology is complex, and encompasses both specific policy preferences in a given political context, as well as the kinds of general attitudes that help shape those preferences; in the context of social conservatism, the endorsement of tradition is likely a constituting attitude of the ideology. To operationalize social conservatism in light of these considerations-characterized by both specific policy preferences involving matters of tradition and cultural change, and general attitudinal orientation toward tradition and change -we created a composite socially conservative attitudes ideology scale. This composite scale consisted of the rescaled responses from the Dodd-style issues index and the conventionalism subscale of the ASC (see previous sections for example items). Both the issues index and the ASC scale have been widely used to measure social conservatism and attitudes toward tradition [e.g., 19, 49] . Further, because these individual scales focus on, respectively, general attitudes toward tradition, and specific policy preferences related to social conservatism, combining them provides a more complete measurement of socially conservative ideology. The resultant composite socially conservative attitudes variable was measured on a -1-to-1 scale, where increasing scores indicate increasing socially conservative attitudes.

Indeed, among Republicans, economic conservatism negatively correlated with concern over the direct health consequences of the pandemic (see S3 Appendix). Further, economic conservatism appears to contribute to the suppression of an underlying relationship between socially conservative attitudes and precautionary behaviors among Republicans, revealing a conflict between economic considerations and reaction to the pathogen threat posed by COVID-19. We did not find evidence that Republicans were more likely than Democrats to report taking personal steps to buffer themselves against the potential economic consequences of the pandemic (see S3 Appendix). This may be because their buffering efforts are focused on behaviors such as protesting public health orders, rather than on the economic precautions we measured; alternatively, the perceived conflict between economic considerations and responses to the health threat of COVID-19 may be primarily ideological in nature. Informational considerations may also bear on the interacting effects of economic and social conservatism in shaping prophylactic behaviors. By virtue of shared coalitional membership, the priorities of Republicans for whom economic conservatism is paramount may color the information environment or valuations of Republicans for whom social conservatism looms largest. Addressing the concerns of powerful U.S. economic conservatives, conservative leaders and media, and other coalitional supporters in Republican social networks may prioritize the economic dangers of lockdowns and aid appropriations over the health threats of COVID-19; this may then influence social conservatives' perceptions.",

The suppressor variables that were observed among Republicans and Independents could plausibly be responsible for a lack of a socially conservative shift among members of those political affiliations. Specifically, as our present data show (see S3 Appendix), lower trust in scientists and liberal and moderate information sources, lower consumption of liberal media, and higher economic conservatism appear to clash with the perception that COVID-19 poses a substantial health threat. This diminished perception of hazard may weaken compensatory threat responses in social conservatives.

Disgust reactivity is thus implicated in responses to this real-world pathogen threat, suggesting that theories such as the traditional-norms account can be justifiably applied to, and tested in relation to, this pandemic. However, socially conservative attitudes remained a robust predictor of prophylaxis after controlling for disgust sensitivity, hence precautionary behaviors aimed at avoiding COVID-19 do not appear to be fully explained by disgust responses. Measures of pathogen disgust sensitivity, including that which we employed, do not specify a context for confronting the pathogen threat, and hence the costs of avoiding the threat are unclear. In contrast, the costs of avoiding COVID-19 are real and substantial, and may be expected to vary significantly across individuals. Finally, while disgust sensitivity correlated with social conservatism among Democrats, it did not consistently do so among Republicans or Independents.

In Study 1, controlling for the combined effects of the suppressors yielded a significant positive relationship between precautionary behaviors and socially conservative attitudes among members of all major U.S. parties.

For example, in regard to the relationship between socially conservative attitudes and the suppressor variables, longitudinal research might investigate the extent to which partisan media environments shape beliefs and behaviors regarding different threats, versus the extent to which individuals seek out media environments that accord with their previous beliefs. Further, especially given the question of social conservative shifts during periods of threat, the direction of causality for the relationship between socially conservative attitudes and COVID-19 precautions found in this study is undetermined. For example, our results are consistent with the possibility of a socially conservative shift among Democrats most threatened by the pandemic; we cannot disentangle that causal pathway from one in which Democrats who were more socially conservative to begin with responded to the pandemic with greater threat avoidance. Again, longitudinal research may provide leverage on this issue. Alternatively, experimental elicitations of threat could also probe the question of directionality. However, it would be difficult to build the real-world contextualizing factors found in this study into an experimental design, thus limiting the inferential value.

In regard to data quality, we pre-screened for high-reputation workers-which has been shown to have a strong positive effect [65] -used re-captcha at the beginning of the survey to exclude automated bots, and included multiple attention checks.

Therefore, the overall generalizability of our test of the real-world validity of the traditionalnorms account of the relationship between socially conservative attitudes and pathogen avoidance is limited by the lack of cross-cultural corroboration.

However, many of these studies do not differentiate between political orientation and partisan identity, nor do they consider the potential interaction between them, nor examine suppressor variables linked to partisanship. These studies conclude that conservatism broadly negatively predicts COVID-19 precautions and concern. However, this result is potentially superficial, as it may owe variously to a) treating social conservatism/liberalism as isomorphic with political party affiliation; b) failure to measure distinct dimensions of ideology, such as social conservatism/liberalism, and economic conservatism/liberalism; c) failure to consider whether the effects of conservatism vary as a function of partisanship; and/or d) failure to assess suppressor variables linked to partisanship. In contrast, our results indicate that complex interactions between party affiliation and political ideology produce relationships between conservatism and COVID-19 precautions that run counter to the common assumption that conservatism is negatively associated with COVID-19 precaution. Our findings thus suggest that, both in research regarding COVID-19 and politics in the United States, and in a wide variety of related investigations, it is advisable to treat ideology and party affiliation as potentially non-substitutable, interacting variables.",

In particular, it appears that competing political factors, media consumption choices, and differences in trust may be affecting what may be underlying relationships between traditionalist social attitudes and sensitivity to pathogen threats. We speculate that Republicans-relative to Democrats-are likely exposed to and/or seek out informational environments that minimize the direct consequences of COVID-19. Instead, these informational environments may emphasize threats that resonate more strongly with the economic and libertarian dimensions of conservatism that also characterize the Republican party. These dynamics may have been amplified by the looming 2020 U. S. general election, where political and media elites in the Republican party may have been particularly motivated to downplay the threats and costs associated with the pandemic because of the potential for negative electoral consequences.
