However, the research on the influence and the control mechanism of different air conditioning systems on the transmission path of virus aerosol particles exhaled by patients is still limited. To evaluate the effects of different air conditioning systems on the spread of human exhaled pollutants, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to study the movement and diffusion of exhaled air from two rows of 12 sitting adults in a hospital's closed transfusion room. In this paper, three different air conditioning systems are considered: Ceil-supply and Down-return (Ceil-to-Down), Upsupply and Down-return (Up-to-Down), Down-supply and Up-return (Down-to-Up). The distribution of exhaled air velocity, temperature, and virus particle concentration were studied, and it is found that the horizontal diffusion distance of exhaled pollutants is about 0.75 -1.1 m. When up to down systems are used, the air conditioning system shall be closed in time in case of respiratory infectious diseases, so as to avoid cross-infection in the enclosed space. A relatively clean air area with a height of about 1.1 m will be formed, which can inhibit the transmission of the virus to a certain extent when using the down-to-up system. But for those who are exposed to the enclosed space for a long time, the down-to-up system is not the most suitable air conditioning system.",

With the spread of the epidemic, such cases have occurred in China and other countries and regions in world. According to China's novel coronavirus pneumonia diagnosis and treatment plan (Trial Seventh Edition), the epidemiological characteristics of the COVIDa e-mail: caorainy@163.com (corresponding author) 19 show that the main route of transmission is respiratory droplet and close contact, when exposed to high-concentration aerosols for a long time in a relatively closed space, there is the possibility of infection after transmission by aerosol. In the early stage of the epidemic, there were many cross and cluster infections in families, offices and hospitals, such as in Harbin and Japan. When a virus-infected patient enters a closed space, the pathogen is discharged into the surrounding air environment by means of breathing, speaking, coughing, and sneezing [1] . With the strong disturbance of the air flow, the pathogen can spread to a certain distance with the help of aerosol state, thus infecting other healthy human bodies. For an enclosed space, such as an office or hospital infusion clinic, how to accurately quantify the transmission of exhaled air from a virus-infected person will be of great significance for controlling and preventing the spread of the disease.",

            "text": "From the outbreaks of SARS in 2003 and H1N1 flu in 2009 to the COVID-19 outbreak in 2019 [2, 3] , in order to control and reduce the risk of the spread of these infectious virus aerosols, many scholars have focused their research on the dynamics of human exhaled airflow in a closed environment and the effects of droplet containing aerosols on human health, which is also the first step to understand and study the transmission of virus infection. A healthy person inhales the air around the head (5-6 l/min) into the human lung through the respiratory tract, after the absorption of the lung, and then exhales the waste air from the mouth (4.2% CO 2 , 6.2% water vapor) to the surrounding air environment [4] [5] [6] . A virus-infected patient's air droplets exhaled through breathing, speaking, coughing, and sneezing may contain a large amount of virus particles. They move in the air through the aerosol state and will infect healthy people around them. In a relatively calm environment, the infected patient can cough or sneeze to spray droplets out of the face about 2-3 m without taking protective measures such as masks [7] . Because of the very obvious infection symptoms when talking, coughing, and sneezing, healthy people usually keep alert and keep away from patients, so they often reduce the risk of infection from pollution sources. But for normal breathing, especially in the incubation period of disease, patients or suspected cases without any symptoms, people will lose vigilance to the possible cross-infection, which will greatly increase the risk of infection. In addition, although the intensity of normal breath and speech breath is low, normal speech breath is also an important way of disease transmission, because it has a high frequency. For example, when breathing normally for 2 h, the total amount of air exhaled is 1600 L, which is equivalent to the amount of air emitted by 100 coughs. Therefore, the impact of the release of droplets on the human body during normal breathing cannot be ignored. It can be seen from the above that the diffusion process of the air generated by breathing during normal speech should also be highly valued by researchers.",

            "text": "Generally, the frequency and intensity of respiration depend on the metabolism of human body. The ventilation capacity of a healthy adult lung is about 5-6 l/min, 10-20times/min. For the sake of simplicity, many researchers ignore the inhalation process and only consider the exhalation process through nose or mouth. For example, Xu et al. [8] used nondestructive Schlieren photography technology to carry out visualization and quantitative experimental research on the development characteristics of breath dynamics of 18 healthy human subjects while standing and lying down, providing a large number of experimental test data. Soon-Bark Kwon et al. [4] also used related technical methods to study the initial velocity and angle of the exhaled air flow when the human body coughs and speaks. Li and Zhao et al. [9] used numerical simulation technology to study the exhalation and inhalation of the human body model, and the movement of exhaled air from the nose was simulated. In a calm environment, due to the effect of buoyancy [10] , the exhaled air jet has a tendency to go down first and then up. This is because the surrounding air temperature is usually lower than the temperature of the exhaled air, which is generally kept between 32-33\u00b0C, and the temperature will change with the entrainment of the surrounding air in the jet process. The speed and angle of human exhaled air play an important role in the transmission process of virus aerosol particles, so it is necessary to conduct in-depth study on the process of human exhaled air and its affected areas.",

With the acceleration of many resumption processes, how to effectively prevent and control the transmission of new coronavirus (COVID-19) through the air conditioning system has also been the concern of many scholars. For example, for the closed space of the hospital, Sasan faridi [11] and others collected and detected the air at 10 monitoring points in a hospital ward in Iran, and found that the new coronavirus (COVID-19) did not stay in the air for a long time, which mainly depended on the respiratory tract to transmit the exhaled air aerosol particles. He [12] conducted a 2-week continuous measurement of indoor and outdoor air particle concentration in PICU, Royal Children's Hospital, Brisbane, Australia, to study the indoor particle trajectory under different air conditioning systems. Similarly, R. Yam [13] , Taesub Lim [14] , R.E. Stockwell et al. [15] , RB, Montvale [16] , Villafruela [17] , Shengwei Zhu et al. [18] also studied the virus transmission rules for different buildings and different types of air conditioning and ventilation systems. For general office buildings, Zhang et al. [6] used CFD to study the characteristics of exhaled air flow of adults sitting in quiet indoor offices, and analyzed the effects of different head posture, breathing mode, breathing rate, indoor ventilation on the respiratory flow, and the diffusion of exhaled pollutants. Wei [19] critically reviewed the impact of different office building air conditioning systems on the spread of viruses, and suggested that replacement ventilation may not be suitable for building spaces where respiratory infections need to be considered. For the closed vehicle interior space, Liu [20] summarized the prediction, design and analysis methods of airflow distribution in the cabin. Parham Azimi [21] conducted a numerical evaluation of the risk of airborne influenza infections under three mixed ventilation methods in public transportation (such as bus microenvironment) and obtained their ability to limit the risk of airborne influenza infections.",

It is very difficult to quantitatively analyze the transmission path of virus particles, but it is a work that can be concluded through data analysis to quantitatively analyze the size of the impact area caused by the exhaled air of human body. The air exhaled by the human body model is first mixed with the surrounding air, the speed gradually decreases, and it will be affected by the internal air conditioning system in the enclosed space during the subsequent movement. Under the above-mentioned comprehensive action, the distribution of indoor air flow velocity cloud diagrams composed of three different air conditioning systems is shown in Fig. 5 . Figure 5 shows the air velocity contour of the enclosed space under the action of three air conditioning systems. Exhaled air of the human body model shows different distribution rules under the influence of the three air conditionings. In Fig. 5(A) , fresh air is sent into the enclosed space from the middle of the ceiling. The initial velocity is large, and it can be directly jetted to the middle position of the two rows of mannequins, which is the activity area of family members or medical staff. Near the breathing area of the human model, the exhaled air of the model first forms a vortex area above the head, and then gradually merges into the whole air flow field in the closed space. It can be seen that the area affected by the exhalation of the human model is mainly near the head position of the model. In Fig. 5(B) , the fresh air clings to the top wall and is incident from both sides of the top. During the process of jet flow to the middle position, it gradually drops under the effect of its own gravity, and then drops to the middle area as a whole after converging at the middle position of the closed space. At this time, the breathing area of the human model is similar to (A), and a vortex area is formed above the model head. However, for Fig. 5(C) , the eddy current area of the head position of the manikin moves compared with (A) and (B), and the overall distance between this area and the head position increases, that is to say, a eddy current is formed in the area where doctors or family members stand when communicating with patients.",

In addition, because the top air supply speed is large and the air supply volume is relatively concentrated, which makes the wind speed of the mouth position of the mannequin in the Ceil-to-Down environment drop the fastest and the largest.

Figure 7 also shows that the three air supply methods will cause the distribution of the temperature in the middle of the enclosed space to be lower and the temperature around the human body model to be higher.

However, in the three air supply modes (A), (B) and (C), the air temperature at the head and foot position of the human body model shows a large difference, in which (C) mode is the largest, and is greater than 3\u00b0C. In this air supply mode, the thermal comfort of the human body is less than the other two air supply modes.",

Healthy people are extremely susceptible to infection if exposed to this environment for a long time. Fig. 9 The relative concentration distribution of virus particles in the enclosed space under: A Ceil-to-Down system; B Up-to-Down system; C Down-to-Up system Through the analysis of the indoor air velocity and temperature distribution law under the combined action of the human body model exhaled air and different air conditioning systems, in order to more accurately describe the propagation of virus particles in the enclosed space, now assume that there is a person in the enclosed space who is a virus-infected patient, and all the gas exhaled from his mouth and nose carries virus particles. At this time, assume that the concentration of virus particles in the exhaled air is 100%. As the exhaled air mixes with the surrounding air and the virus particles diffuse themselves, the particle concentration gradually decreases. Now the particle concentration distribution characteristics (relative to the percentage concentration at the outlet) are expressed in the form of the following cloud diagram. The specific results are shown in Fig. 9 . Figure 9 shows the concentration distribution of virus containing aerosol particles exhaled by patients in the enclosed space after indoor movement fewer than three kinds of air conditioning systems. It can be seen that under the Up-to-Down system (B), a relatively uniform mixture of virus particles and indoor air is formed in the enclosed space. In the middle part of the enclosed space, that is, the active area of medical staff is also infected, in this kind of environment; it is very easy to cause hospital infection of the first-line medical staff. Comparing (A) and (C), it can be found that in (A), because of the top air supply, a relatively narrow clean area is formed in the closed space, and this clean area is related to the size of the air supply outlet and the speed of the air supply outlet. In (C), because there is a strip air supply at the bottom, a relatively stable and wide clean space can be formed in the closed space, which can effectively control the spread and spread of virus particles in the area, so as to effectively protect the safety of medical personnel entering the closed space.",

Assuming that the height of a normal frontline medical staff is in the range of 1.5 m~1.8 m, and the head position is also in the above height range, it can be seen that the better indoor clean area due to the good floor air supply mode cannot produce satisfactory protection ability for front-line medical staff.",

It is of great significance to understand the specific movement track of the virus particles for indoor protection. For this reason, the movement track of indoor virus particles is simulated and analyzed, and the specific results are shown in Fig. 11 . It is assumed that the second human model sitting on one side of the enclosed space is a virus-infected patient. Figure 11 shows that the person whose head of the human model in the enclosed space is marked as red is a virus-infected patient. In three different air conditioning systems, the virus particles emitted from the mouth of the patient will form a circulation flow in the enclosed space. In Fig. 11 (A) Ceil-to-Down system, as the fresh air is mainly sent into the room from the middle of the roof, the movement track of the virus is significantly larger than that of (B) Up-to-Down system and (C) Down-to-Up system. In addition, in Fig. 11 (C) Down-to-Up system, due to the long slit form of the floor air supply inlet and the loose sealing of the internal doors or windows in the enclosed space, the fresh air entering the enclosed space will form a long air duct surrounding the whole human body model, and present the particle precipitation effect of the \"cyclone separator.\" Among them, the virus particles exhaled by the patients with virus infection will move horizontally along with the occurrence of horizontal movement, and continuously move horizontally along with the pressure change inside the long air duct in the horizontal direction on one side of the room, which will have an impact on the healthy population sitting on the same side as the patients with virus infection.",

Compared with the other two systems, the clean area can not only prevent healthy people from cross-infection, but also provide medical staff with safe working area. However, the size of the isolation area, especially the height value, is related to the speed and flow of the air supply inlet. Under the simulated working condition, the height is about 1.1 m, which can reduce the probability of infection of non-viral infection patients who are seated in the closed space. Unfortunately, the height of the head breathing area of the medical staff or other adults passing through the environment is higher than this value, and the cleaning area can only protect the children with low height.",

When the human body is breathing normally, the horizontal diffusion distance of exhaled pollutants is about 0.75~1.1 m when the three kinds of ventilation air extraction systems are used. 2. When the Up-to-Down system is used in a closed office building or medical building, when there is a viral epidemic in the area, the central air conditioning system should be closed in time to avoid cross-infection in the closed space. 3. When the Down-to-Up system is adopted, a relatively clean air area with a height of about 1.1 m will be formed in the enclosed space.
