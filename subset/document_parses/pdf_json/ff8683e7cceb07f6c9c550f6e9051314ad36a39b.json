IORD has Research Ethics Committee and Confidentiality Advisory Group approval (19/SC/0403, 19/CAG/0144) for use as a deidentified electronic research database 9 . COVID-19 diagnosis was retrospectively defined as a composite of select internationally standardised diagnostic codes (using ICD10 codes Z208, Z861, J128, M358, Z115 and/or a positive PCR test for SARS-CoV2 during the patient encounter. We determined a patient had deteriorated if they required application of NIV, were admitted onto ICU or died within four weeks of admission, remaining patients being censored at that point. All data analyses were undertaken in R (version 4.0.2). Out of 3,280 patients reviewed in acute ambulatory care over the study period, 771 (23.5%) were suspected of having COVID-19, with serum calprotectin levels available within 48 hours of presentation to hospital (Table 1). Of the 771, 222 (28.8%; 6.8% of all those reviewed) had a final diagnosis of COVID-19 and 25 (11.3%) of these patients reached the composite endpoint (18 died, 6 commenced on NIV and 2 admitted onto ICU, where one individual died after commencing on NIV).Univariate associations with risk of deterioration were observed for several variables including Charlson comorbidity index (P=8.1x10 -5 ), oxygen saturation (P=7.6x10 -3 ), and Creactive protein (P=4.5x10 -5 ), but not neutrophil count or calprotectin(Table 1). Calprotectin had a univariate area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUROC) estimate of 0.61 (95% confidence interval 0.48-0.74) compared to 0.76 (0.67-0.84) for CRP in patients with COVID-19 (Figure 1A) with a similar pattern observed for all 771 individuals tested (AUROC 0.62 and 0.79 respectively). Use of CRP had a statistically greater capability of discriminating risk of deterioration compared to calprotectin in both analyses (P=0.01).",
