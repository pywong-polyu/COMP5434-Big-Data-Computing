It has infected millions of people and continues a mortifying influence on the global population's health and well-being. In this situation, genome sequence analysis and advanced artificial intelligence techniques may help researchers and medical experts to understand the genetic variants of COVID-19 or SARS-CoV-2. Genome sequence analysis of COVID-19 is crucial to understand the virus's origin, behavior, and structure, which might help produce/develop vaccines, antiviral drugs, and efficient preventive strategies. This paper introduces an artificial intelligence based system to perform genome sequence analysis of COVID-19 and alike viruses, e.g., SARS, middle east respiratory syndrome, and Ebola. The system helps to get important information from the genome sequences of different viruses. We perform comparative data analysis by extracting basic information of COVID-19 and other genome sequences, including information of nucleotides composition and their frequency, tri-nucleotide compositions, count of amino acids, alignment between genome sequences, and their DNA similarity information. We use different visualization methods to analyze these viruses' genome sequences and, finally, apply machine learning based classifier support vector machine to classify different genome sequences. The data set of different virus genome sequences are obtained from an online publicly accessible data center repository. The system achieves good classification results with an accuracy of 97% for COVID-19, 96%, SARS, and 95% for MERS and Ebola genome sequences, respectively.",

Since then, tens of thousands of samples have been sequenced worldwide [2] . Genomics, which is concerned with the genetic substance of an organism, is one of the most promising fields of research for COVID-19. Genome sequence analysis uses an organism's genome information to guide clinical experts to give more personalized therapeutic or diagnostic decision-making strategies. By unlocking the virus's genetic information and the most badly affected hosts (patients), experts might hope to inform public health, make better decisions and find effective treatments. An organism's genome comprises four nucleotide bases (Adenine-A, Guanine-G, Cytosine-C, and Thymine-T) stored as an encoded sequence that forms its nucleic acids. The novel COVID-19 genome sequence is an enclosed single-stranded positive-sense RNA (Ribonucleic acid) from a long family called Coronavirus, approximately 30 kB long, categorized under three groups, in which two are responsible for infections in mammals, such as bat SARS-CoV like; (MERS-CoV) [3] .",

In contrast, significant to promote distinct biomedical data for personalized medicine, this integrative research of omics and clinical data creates complex scientific and computational demands for researchers, medical experts, and clinical services. Due to this, there is a need for computational techniques that facilitates the evaluation of extensive high-dimensional and heterogeneous data sets (i.e., those consist of distinct attributes) and systems that might give easier, cheaper, extensible, and comprehensive experimental and analytical solutions. For instance, such data sets may produce together: e.g., molecular data (genes, proteins, physiological evaluations), including measures of critical organ systems, medical image data (consist of CT, MRI scans, etc.).",

There is a developing demand for computational methods that enable the analysis of large complex and highdimensional genome data sets. Artificial intelligence can promote new findings in these data sets without indicating specific rules and interests in different genomic data pipeline stages. Mostly developed work in artificial intelligence with genome data sets has been taking place within the analysis and perception stage. Artificial intelligence has been devoting significant incremental developments in clinical genome analysis, such as phenotyping in rare syndromes, cancer, its variants investigation, and explanation. Although, mostly artificial intelligence-based work in the field of genomics is within the research phase. The demand of machine and deep learning techniques for functional genomics analysis is rising. Most aspects of genome analysis have been traced by these techniques, from genome sequencing, phenotyping, and variant identification, to downstream analysis. Now improvements in computing, artificial intelligence, and the increase in biomedical data sets enable advances to existing fields of service. Simultaneously, these advancements in open access research and open-source tools make artificial intelligence use and prosperity across various types of genome studies.

The COVID-19 and other viruses, including SARS, MERS, and Ebola genomes, are used in this study. We start our analysis by reading the DNA sequence; by doing this, we extracted the nucleotides information or length of the genome sequence, the length of the COVID-19 genome sequence is 29,903, SARS genome sequence is 2975, MERS genome sequence is 30,119, and Ebola genome sequence length is 18,959. The visualization results of the nucleotides of each genome sequence DNA are shown in Fig. 2 . DNA is the hereditary material in organisms found in the cell's nucleus (where it is called nuclear DNA). The DNA information is saved as a code formed from four chemical bases: Adenine-A, Guanine-G, Cytosine-C, and Thymine-T, as shown in Fig. 2 . It can be seen that the composition of nucleotides in each genome sequence is different. The nucleotides in DNA have been shown in different colors. For example, we just plotted the first three hundred nucleotides of each genome sequence; it can be easily observed that the distribution of nucleotides is varying. In Fig. 3 , we have shown the composition of each nucleotide in the DNA of different genome sequences. It can be seen that the frequency of the nucleotides A and T are higher than the frequency of C and G. Due to the nucleotides pairing, the most present nucleotide in COVID-19, SARS, and MERS is T, while the most present nucleotide in Ebola is A. It is concluded that A and T are the most present nucleotides in all of the genome sequences; the distribution of other nucleotides still varies. We can observe that there is a big difference between the amount of Cytosine-Guanine (GC) and Adenine-Thymine (AT) in both COVID-19 and SARS. Using the nucleotides frequency, we can also determine the GC% for each genome sequence, which gives important information regarding the stability of the DNA. The amount of GC is pretty much close to AT, which will lead us to assume that the GC percentage of the Ebola virus genome sequence has the highest GC percentage estimated as 45.50%, which means it has the most stable DNA. Second, comes the SARS and MERS Virus genome sequence with 40.76% and 41.76% of GC percentage, respectively, and the genome sequence with the least stable DNA is COVID-19 with 37.97%. This information is important for researchers as the stability of DNA is essential to resist change.",

The process called gene expression: data from a gene is used to synthesize an operative gene product. These products are often proteins. Thus we performed transcription in which DNA is copied out into a messenger RNA (mRNA), and using translation, mRNA is translated into amino acids. It is a translation from one code (nucleotide A T C G sequence) to another code (amino acid sequence). Not all amino acid sequences are proteins. Only the sequences with more than 20 amino acids code Figure 6 shows the open reading frames (ORFs) in the COVID-19, SARS, MERS, and Ebola genome. After converting the DNA into amino acids, as now we have the protein sequences, we used an open reading frame, which is the portion of a reading frame that can be translated. It is a portion of a DNA molecule that carries no-stop codons when changed into amino acids. The genetic code shows DNA sequences in combinations of three base partners, which determines that a double-stranded DNA molecule can be interpreted in any of six probable reading frames, like three in reverse and three in the forward direction. A long reading frame is an acceptable component of a gene. 4 It usually starts with an origin codon (normally AUG) and terminates at a stop codon (ordinarily UAA, UAG, or UGA). We used the transcription and translation to genome sequences with (Genbank format). It shows the ORFs in the genome sequence and the GC% content. The graph on the x-axis showing the GC%; it is important to understand where the coding regions are in the genome sequence.

We used SVM, a popular and efficient supervised machine learning classifier used for regression and classification problems. We used multiple genome sequences of all four types of viruses, performed some pre-processing, manually assigned class labels, and extracted useful features provided to SVM classifiers. We randomly splitted the collected genome coding sequences into training and testing samples at ratio of 80% and 20%, respectively. At the output, the classifier Fig. 1 . The SVM classifier determines a hyper-plane in feature space that best segregates the sequence data into four classes. The further the data points fall from the hyperplane, the higher the chances are of being classified correctly. The data points that are nearest to the hyper-plane are referred to as support vectors. If these support vectors are eliminated, the hyperplane's position will alter; thus, they are considered the crucial elements of the data set. The distance between either side of the hyperplane and the support vectors is referred to as the margin. The target is to select a hyper-plane with the largest margin between each point in the training set and the hyper-plane to correctly classify the new data. Since SVM are binary, multi-class problems need to be reduced to several binary classification problems. In this work, we used linear SVM. The objective function of SVM classification is provided as follows;",

Second, we used different visualization methods to analyze these viruses' genome sequences. The comparative data analysis helps to get important information from the genome sequences of different viruses. Finally, we applied a machine learning based classifier, i.e., SVM, to classify different genome sequences. The data set of different virus genome sequences are obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information Data Center repository. The proposed system achieves good classification results with an accuracy of 97% for COVID-19, 96% for SARS, and 95% for MERS, and Ebola 95%, respectively. In the future, we might extend this work for the analysis and classification of other genome sequences. Researchers are encouraged to use other artificial intelligence based techniques for the analysis and classification of genome sequences.",
