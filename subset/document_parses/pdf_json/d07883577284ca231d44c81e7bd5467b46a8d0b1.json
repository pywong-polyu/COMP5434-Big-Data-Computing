However, risk factors for SLD in individuals with obesity have not been examined. OBJECTIVES: To identify the independent risk factors for SLD among participants with obesity from the UK Biobank. METHODS: A total of 80,224 UK Biobank participants with obesity (body mass index[BMI] > 30 kg/m 2 ) and 242,822 without obesity, of European descent without clinical history of liver disease and liver cancer were prospectively followed for the onset of SLD, defined as a composite diagnosis of cirrhosis, decompensated liver disease, hepatocellular carcinoma and/or liver transplantation. Risk factors for incident SLD were assessed by Cox proportional hazards models. Different clinical phenotypes were derived by latent class analysis (LCA). RESULTS: Obesity conferred a 2.6-fold increased risk for SLD that was abolished after the inclusion of waist circumference (WC) in the model. Among individuals with obesity, age (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.05, 95%CI 1.03-1.07, p = 3.9 * 10 \u22127 ), type 2 diabetes (aHR 2.18, 95%CI 1.55-3.05, p = 6.2 * 10 \u22126 ), PNPLA3 rs738409 (aHR 1.59, 95%CI 1.33-1.9, p = 3.1 * 10 \u22127 ) and WC (aHR 1.04, 95%CI 1.02-1.06, p = 8.5 * 10 \u22126 ) were independent predictors of SLD. BMI category-specific WC thresholds allowed a better risk stratification compared to traditional ones. By LCA, the clinical phenotype at highest risk for SLD was that with BMI < 35 kg/m 2 and WC above BMI-category specific thresholds. CONCLUSIONS: Age, WC, type 2 diabetes, and the PNPLA3 variant are the main risk factors for SLD in individuals with obesity. WC is the principal mediator of SLD risk conveyed by increased BMI. BMI category-specific WC-thresholds may refine the SLD risk more accurately than traditional thresholds.",

However,~500 million individuals are estimated to be obese [11] , making this proposal unfeasible. ALT values do not correlate with histological findings and are unhelpful in both the diagnosis of NAFLD and determining disease severity [12] . The identification of risk factors to stratify individuals with obesity that will progress to severe liver disease (SLD), i.e., cirrhosis, cirrhosis decompensation, HCC, and liver-related death, emerges as crucial. Indeed, it may allow to prioritize subjects with obesity to the screening for NAFLD and advanced liver fibrosis. However, to the best of our knowledge, the identification of risk factors for SLD specifically in individuals with obesity from the general population has not been done.",

At the baseline assessment visit, they completed a touchscreen self-administered questionnaire and a computer-assisted interview regarding medical history, current pharmacological therapy, sociodemographic characteristics, smoking status, alcohol consumption, dietary habits, physical activity, and family history of major diseases. Baseline anthropometric measures (e.g., height, weight, and waist circumference) were assessed by trained staff using standardized procedures. Blood samples were collected for genome-wide genotyping and biochemical analyses, including serum glucose, total cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), and albumin (AU5800, Beckman Coulter). The protocol for sample collecting, processing, and storage was developed using a highly automated and validated approach [18] .

Multivariable models were carried out to correct for potential confounders, and included variables associated with outcome with a p value < 0.1 at univariate analysis. The proportional hazard assumption was verified through the inspection of the Schoenfeld residuals. Risk estimates of different WC thresholds for the development of SLD were also computed applying Cox proportional regression models corrected for age and gender. Finally, we assessed whether the main risk factors for SLD aggregated into distinct classes (clinical phenotypes) using the latent class analysis (LCA). We used this method to test the hypothesis that the UKBB population of subjects with obesity comprises N sub-populations (classes) characterized by the co-occurrence of risk factors. N was fixed at 3 for both genders, corresponding to the value that maximized the goodness-offit (evaluated by Bayesian information factor -BIC-) of models with different class numbers ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Once the classes were obtained, the specific incidence of SLD within each clinical phenotype was computed. All cumulative incidence curves for SLD occurrence were calculated using Aalen-Johansen estimator, with incident non-NAFLD liver disease and mortality entered as competing event for SLD. Analyses were stratified according to gender and conducted with R statistics 4.0.2 (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria).",

In this regard, previous studies have identifed risk factors for SLD in diabetic participants of large population based studies from Sweden and UK [21, 22] . However, to date, there is no study specifically aimed to verify the determinants of SLD in individuals with obesity.",

Obesity was a significant risk factor for SLD even after adjusting for confounders, including age, gender, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia. However, the association between obesity and SLD was abolished when WC was included as a covariate in the analysis, and, most notably, even when the model was adjusted only for WC. These results suggest that abdominal adiposity is the main determinant of SLD risk conveyed by obesity. Consistent with this notion, WC is robustly associated with all-cause and cardiovascular mortality [23] [24] [25] [26] . With respect to liver disease, literature on the association between WC and SLD is scarce and somehow controversial [27] , but a recent metanalysis suggests that measures of central obesity are better than BMI at prognosticating SLD [27] .",

In this context, we demonstrate that type 2 diabetes is still the most dangerous comorbidity with respect to the risk of adverse hepatic outcomes even when the analysis is limited to subjects with obesity. Concerning genetic variants, NAFLD is a multifactorial disease whose heritability estimates has been found to range from 20% to 70%, depending on different type and design of the studies [29] [30] [31] . Moreover, as we reviewed elsewhere [32] , most of the variants which have been more consistently associated with liver fat content, i.e., PNPLA3 rs738409, TM6SF2 rs58542926, and MBOAT7 rs641738, have been subsequently associated also with development of NASH and fibrosis, suggesting that the amount of hepatic fat is a crucial driver of disease progression [33, 34] . Accordingly, a polygenic risk score designed for its capability to predict hepatic fat content has been associated with liver injury, inflammation and fibrosis [33] .",

            "text": "In our study, abdominal adiposity, i.e., WC, was an independent driver of disease progression in individuals with obesity. The gender-specific thresholds were originally developed in a large sample of white men and women in which a WC of 102 cm and 88 cm, respectively, corresponded to a BMI of 30 kg/m 2 [37] . Thus, these thresholds were designed to be used in place of BMI as an alternative way to identify those in need of weight management rather than for their relationship with health risk. Accordingly, in this study,~84% and~99% of obese with BMI 30-34 kg/m 2 and Fig. 1 Cumulative incidence of severe liver disease across groups of individuals with normal weight, overweight, and obesity, in the overall population and stratified by gender. P values are from log-rank tests. \u226535 kg/m 2 , respectively, were above these thresholds (see Fig. 2 ). Although redefining WC thresholds based on the underlying class of obesity improves the risk stratification and prediction for cardiovascular events [15, 16] , these BMI category-specific WC thresholds have never been investigated before with respect to the occurrence of SLD. Here we found that BMI category-specific thresholds allow a refinement in risk stratification for SLD, which is higher in women and in those with BMI 30-34 kg/m 2 . Notably, for subjects with the highest WC thresholds, a BMI \u2265 35 kg/m 2 was even protective with respect to BMI 30-34 kg/m 2 . Results obtained by latent class analysis recapitulated these findings. In both genders, the obese clinical phenotype showing the highest rates of cardiometabolic comorbidities and the highest risk for SLD was that with BMI < 35 kg/m 2 and WC above BMI category specific thresholds. Indeed, for any given WC, the higher the BMI the lower the risk of death [38] , likely because larger BMI may be driven by an increased accumulation of subcutaneous adipose tissue in the lower body that is known to be metabolically healthy [14] . This is consistent with the finding that, while in univariate analysis BMI shows a strong positive association with visceral adipose tissue, after adjustment for WC the association becomes even inverse and BMI is positively associated with lower body subcutaneous adipose tissue and skeletal muscle mass [39] . This observation is consistent with the negative association commonly observed between BMI and morbidity and mortality after adjustment for WC. This study has several strengths: a) the large sample size, with inclusion of more than 80,000 subjects with obesity and more than 240,000 without obesity from the general population; b) the prospective design; c) the extensive analysis of genetic and acquired risk factors in all participants; d) the use of standardized procedures and of a centrally validated protocol for blood samples collection, processing and storage in the UK Biobank. The present study has also some limitations. First, asymptomatic advanced liver disease (e.g., compensated cirrhosis or new-onset HCC on NAFLD) may have been overlooked. However, liver-related diagnoses were linked from multiple registers (i.e., hospital records, death register and cancer register) to limit this bias. Similarly, even in a minority of cases, subjects identified with portal hypertension or varices may be affected by non-cirrhotic rather than cirrhotic portal hypertension. We have also to aknowledge that the WC thredsholds we have used were originally derived for the prediction of cardiovascular disease. However, it was not within the aims of our study, nor consistent with its design, to derive and validate novel thresholds for the prediction of SLD in subjects with obesity. Rather, we aimed to provide proof of concept that BMI-category specific WC thresholds Fig. 2 Incidence of severe liver disease at the end of follow-up of different thresholds of waist circumference, according to BMI classes in individuals with obesity. Numbers at the base of bars represent the total population in each group along with percentage of subjects over the WC threshold. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01 for comparison of incidence of severe liver disease across BMI groups. P value of 6 * 10 \u22127 and 6 * 10 \u22123 , for comparison of incidence of severe liver disease across different thresholds of waist circumference in BMI 30-34.9 and \u226535 kg/m 2 , respectively. All comparisons were carried out by means of \u03c7 2 test. may refine risk stratification for SLD in subjects with obesity. Finally, the vast majority of the UK Biobank individuals are of European descent, so future studies are needed for extending these findings to different ethnic groups.",
