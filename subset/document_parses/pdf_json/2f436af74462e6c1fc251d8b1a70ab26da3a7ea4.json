Methods This was a retrospective multi-centre study, which included patients who sustained fractures between 20 January and 19 February 2020. The collected data included patients' demographics (age and gender), injury-related (injury type, fracture location, injury mechanism, places where fracture occurred), and treatment modality. SPSS 23.0 was used to describe the data and perform some analysis. Results A total of 436 patients with 453 fractures were included; there were 153 males and 283 females, with an average age of 76.2 years (standard deviation, SD, 7.7 years; 65 to 105). For either males or females, 70-74 years was the most commonly involved age group. A total of 317 (72.7%) patients had their fractures occurring at home. Among 453 fractures, there were 264 (58.3%) hip fractures, accounting for 58.3%. Fall from standing height was the most common cause of fracture, making a proportion of 89.4% (405/453). Most fractures (95.8%, 434/453) were treated surgically, and 4.2% (19/453) were treated by plaster fixation or traction. Open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) was the most used surgical method, taking a proportion of 49.2% (223/453).",

Numerous countries have implemented strict control measures to limit the flow of people, including blockade of city, traffic control, strict access to the community, and selfisolation at home. China has the most serious COVID-19 outbreak since 20 January 2020, and governments at levels implemented the multi-aspect prevention measure to control the epidemic situation and by now these measures have demonstrated to be highly effective.",

Furthermore, in the context of Covid-19, the physical deterioration, prevalent comorbidities, and the potential psychological effects generally place the elderly population at increased risk of accidental events, including cerebrovascular disease (stroke and transient cerebral haemorrhage). In addition, there is an increased concern that the elderly might be at a higher risk of falls and related fractures, due to the more prevalent osteopenia and osteoporosis with aging [4, 5] . These accidental events not only increase the consumption of medical resources that have been already scarce but also make the sustainers susceptible to or infected with COVID-19 via the way of transmission in the hospital. Yanbin Zhu, Wei Chen and Xing Xin contributed equally to this work. Between 20 January and 19 February, which was the most important period for Chinese to struggle against COVID-19, and after then the true inflection point emerged. In this multicentre study, we retrospectively collected data of hospitalized elderly patients who sustained fractures during this period, and our aim was to investigate the epidemiologic characteristics. We hope these data could provide valuable references for the prevention of such accidental injury in this special international situation. This study was approved by the institutional review board of the third Hospital of Hebei Medical University and consent was waived for its retrospective nature.",

            "text": "Under the current global pandemic of COVID-19, knowledge of injury characteristics in the elderly are more important than ever before, because of the higher of morbidity and mortality in such population, if they are infected with 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV). This study retrospectively collected data on fractures in the elderly patients of 14 hospitals in China within a month of the worst COVID-19 outbreak, showing the disproportionately high prevalence of hip fractures (58.3%), low-energy falls being the major injury mechanism, and predominance of home for fractures occurrence. During the epidemic period, governments at all levels in China implemented the strictest measures, and community workers adopted grid checking and voucher access, which greatly reduced the flow of people. On January 23, 2020, the day Wuhan was closed, the foot fall of the shopping malls and supermarkets decreased significantly by more than 95% in numerous cities of C h i n a ( h t t p s : / / b a i j i a h a o . b a i d u . c o m / s ? i d = 1659210676897303602&wfr=spider&for=pc). Up to 19 February, almost all the population was isolated at their own home, except for some workers transporting anti-epidemic materials, health care providers, and administrative staff. In this study, fractures occurring at home or nearby accounted for a proportion of 89.2%, and 94.5% were caused by fall from a standing height or a low height (< 1 m), which was consistent with the strictest anti-epidemic measures. Therefore, targeted measures at home should be considered for effective prevention of such injury. These measures could include keeping adequate light and dry ground in the living room and washing room, antiskid shoes, and Loose fitting and comfortable clothes should be worn on a daily basis, and sitting rather than standing for a bath is important. We also suggest that, for individuals who are seated or lying a long time, slowly getting up by holding on to something (handrail, armchair, or wall) should be considered. Of particular note, for patients who had one or several comorbidities with need of long-term medication management, medications for at least six months should be stocked, considering the epidemic situation of COVID-19.",

This figure was about two to three times as that reported in the elderly patients in the literature [6, 7] . It can be predicted that this will present a great pressure to the medical and health-care centres, given the burden of hip fracture and the increased rate of related morbidities. Based on our an aesthesia and treatment policy which was reviewed during the outbreak of COVID-19, most patients with hip fractures or others will be selected to receive regional/local or intrathecal anaesthesia; general anaesthesia is prescribed only in patients with spinal fractures, pelvis fractures, combined injuries, or in the case of a full stomach but in need of emergency operation. Even in those requiring general anaesthesia, laryngeal mask anaesthesia (LMA) instead of intratracheal intubation anaesthesia (IIA) is chosen, with the aim to reduce or avoid the potential respiratory symptoms to confuse that which was caused by COVID-19. Minimal invasive surgery should be chosen as possible for these fracture patients, to reduce hospitalization stay and to reduce the workload burden of healthcare providers. We suggest that reasonable decision-making for peri-operative management of fractures in elderly will be of great significance in the reduction and even prevention of spread of 2019-nCoV in hospitals.",

The detailed reasons for this include the depressed mood caused by long-term self-isolation and use of unfamiliar chainsaws to repair something due to professional and skilled workers having stopped providing door-to-door services during COVID-19. Accordingly, how to relieve panic, depression, or irritability during the epidemic period is also a topic that needs to be paid attention to. Emotional relief should not only address behaviour but also should provide psychological guidance, such as appeals to the network, relatives, and friends or even psychological doctors. In addition, we suggest that elderly population should not try something unfamiliar and dangerous for them, which might place them at a high risk of injury.",

However, the variables in this study were relatively few, including demographics, injury-related characteristics, and treatment modality. Therefore, recall bias for patients might is likely to be small. Secondly, there were no relevant data on patients' medical conditions, such as comorbidities, presence of osteoporosis, and medications management strategies, which might also have effects on fractures in the elderly. Thirdly, no control group was set for intuitive comparison with findings of this study. But based on strict measures taken currently during COVID-19, we think the differences are dramatic.",
