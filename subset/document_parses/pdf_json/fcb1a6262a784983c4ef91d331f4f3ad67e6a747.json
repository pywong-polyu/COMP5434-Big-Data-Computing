The empirical base of the study was corpus data, materials from online media, social networks, microblogging, blogs, instant messengers, forums, reviews, and video hosting data. The Spanish-language database included 6,640,912 tokens and 43,251,900 characters; the German-language database included 16,322,042 tokens and 109,139,405 characters; and the Russian-language database included 16,310,307 tokens and 109,060,935 characters. With a neural network approach, a multilingual analysis was performed, which made it possible to analyze the topic structure and the semantic network with the allocation of the semantic core and the associative network. Differential and integral features of the identified structures based on the material of these three databases made it possible to determine the general and different characteristics of the perception by Spanish-, German-, and Russian-speaking users of the development of the pandemic, a number of social problems, attitudes toward various types of vaccines, observance of preventive measures, and readiness for vaccination.",

Based on the project data, a study was conducted in 16 European countries in the early period of the pandemic, which showed that Europeans reacted in a similar way to information about the COVID-19 spread in other countries; national differences were of no importance, but age, gender, and educational background affected the perception of COVID-19 under certain conditions. In addition, perceptions of this decease were more consistent in explaining overall stress than taking preventive measures against COVID-19 (Dias Neto et al., 2021) . The perception of COVID-19, the reaction of society to the introduced anti-COVID-19 measures, the need for protective measures (the requirement to observe social distancing, wear masks, wash hands, etc.) largely determines the behavior of people and, as a result, the effectiveness of the fight against the pandemic (Bilgili et al., 2021) .",

            "text": "Research has also shown that Americans perceive the COVID-19 threat as significantly greater than other causes of death to which it has recently been compared, including seasonal flu and car accidents. It is important to note that citizens were less apt to help victims of COVID-19, as they consider such assistance to be dangerous for themselves, and patients with COVID-19 to be more infectious and more responsible for their condition (Niemi et al., 2021) . Similar conclusions are drawn by other researchers who have found that many people, such as health care providers and citizens living in high-risk areas, may experience negative attitudes caused by COVID-19 (Adja et al., 2020; Singh and Subedi, 2020) . Patients with COVID-19 have experienced various types of discrimination, such as isolation, denial of service, harassment, and bullying (Turner-Musa et al., 2020) . As a result, people who become infected or only suspect they have symptoms of COVID-19 postpone seeking medical help or even hide the disease. Such behavior seriously threatens the safety of others, makes it extremely difficult to take anti-COVID-19 measures, and contributes to the spread of the infection (Dubey et al., 2020) . Discrimination against patients with COVID-19, according to experts, is widespread throughout the world, for example, in America, Nepal, Jordan, India, Italy, and China (Aacharya and Shah, 2020; Chopra and Arora, 2020; Khasawneh et al., 2020; Sahoo et al., 2020; Singh and Subedi, 2020; Turner-Musa et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021a) .",

Simulations have shown that vaccination of older people reduces deaths, while vaccination of younger and more socially active people minimizes infections (Wang et al., 2021) . For example, researchers found that Chinese teenagers have a positive attitude toward COVID-19 vaccines (Cai et al., 2021) . Analysis of the intention to receive a vaccine against COVID-19, as well as predictors of such intentions in the Norwegian population, showed that the majority (61.6%) of participants intend to get vaccinated, 24.8% of the population are not sure, and 13.8% are not going to receive the vaccine (Wolff, 2021) . It is important to analyze the motivation of citizens of various countries when making a decision on vaccination. Researchers found that, among Americans, older Asian men with higher levels of education correlated with vaccination (Malik et al., 2020) . Predictors of a positive vaccination decision for British adults are positive beliefs, less fear of side effects, willingness and positive attitude toward obtaining the necessary information to make a reasonable decision to get vaccinated against COVID-19, an increased perception of the COVID-19 risk to others (but not to themselves), old age, and participation in the influenza vaccination in winter 2019/20 (Sherman et al., 2020) . For Australians, refusal to get vaccinated is determined by the belief that the COVID-19 threat is exaggerated by inadequate medical literacy and under education (Dodd et al., 2021) . North American respondents prefer to rely on natural immunity; the lack of confidence in the benefits of the vaccine is determined by fears of unintended consequences in the future and unwillingness to contribute to the commercial profit of pharmaceutical companies (Rosman et al., 2021) . Results of German studies show that, since April 2020, when the intention to get vaccinated was estimated at about 79%, a steady decline has been observed throughout 2020. The lowest rates were recorded in early and mid-December, when only about 48% of the population were ready to get the vaccine against COVID-19. Following this drop, support for vaccination has risen again to 68% by early March 2021 (Betsch et al., 2021) .",

In addition, the n-gram representation of the network is formed by iterative re-weighting at a given number of steps, or based on the convergence criterion of the ranking process. Thus, lexemes are analyzed in the context of syntagmas of a given (n) length on a semantic network formed on the basis of text analysis. The frequency network of the text is built as a set of pairs of words that are found in the sentences of the text. The network vertices are weighted by their frequency of occurrence in the text. The connection weight of a pair of vertices in the network corresponds to the frequency of occurrence of word pairs in text sentences (Kharlamov and Pilgun, 2020) .",

When discussing the specifics of the vaccine production and the vaccination process, actors focus on issues of vaccine knowledge, number of doses, immune response, explanatory process and vaccination strategies. After the emergence of several types of vaccines, actors began to actively discuss the merits of specific vaccines. Pfizer/BioNtech, AstraZeneka, Janssen, and Sputnik received the most attention in the discussion. All vaccines are of foreign origin. Despite the fact that the vaccination process has begun, Spanish users continue to worry about the spread of the infection, its new variants, and waves of infections; at the same time, actors emphasize the decline in the spread of the infection. In addition, other anti-infection measures such as masks and other restrictions are still in place. In the segment of the semantic network dedicated to persons responsible for vaccination, doctors, communities, risk groups, government entities, women, and public sector employees take pride of place. In the vaccination process, Spain aligns itself with the WHO, as well as with the experience of various EU countries and other Latin American countries because of the language proximity, and organizes the process on a territorial basis, while participation in vaccination differs in different cities and autonomous communities.",

After the emergence of several types of vaccines, the actors began to actively discuss the merits of specific vaccines. Moderna, Pfizer/BioNtech, AstraZeneka, and Johnson received the most attention in the discussion, and Germany also participated in the production of some of them. Despite the vaccination, people in Germany are worried about the spread of infection, its new variants, serious consequences, and deaths from the coronavirus infection. Moreover, other protective measures against infection are still in place, such as tests, quarantine, self-isolation, and wearing masks. In the semantic web, a segment is distinguished associated with those responsible for administering vaccinations, along with communities, population groups, with different gender and professional characteristics. The actors are actively discussing the actions of the authorities, politicians, and leading political parties in Germany on the eve of the elections. In the vaccination process, Germany is guided by its own research institute RKI, the experience of various EU countries and other countries, and also organizes vaccination on a territorial basis, and the organization of vaccination differs in individual cities and provinces.",

The study demonstrated the big availability and easy access to the big number of varied sources of information for the German users. The Germanspeaking actors also demanded to provide objective and truthful information about vaccination and its effectiveness and criticized the control and discrimination against vaccination opponents. The data show that the actors negatively perceive information support for vaccination, believe that there is a lack of convincing information in Germany, and doubt the advisability of vaccination. Negative perception is also noted among Russian-speaking users, who received a significant amount of conflicting information from various sources. Spanish-speaking actors mainly relied on official reports and data, without questioning the competence of the authorities in organizing vaccination campaigns. Thus, it can be concluded that the data indicate a high degree of loyalty of the Spanish actors to vaccination supported by trust in the government; therefore, the feasibility of vaccination was practically not discussed by the Spanish actors.",
