The second achievement was about the adverse outcomes of WPV on HPs. Until now, several adverse outcomes of WPV to HPs had been identified, such as physical and mental health problems (9, 10) , poor quality of life (11) , poor sleep quality (12) , and negative work-related outcomes (13) . The next achievement was about the associated factors for WPV against HPs. Several social-demographic (14, 15) and work-related characteristics (16) (17) (18) (19) were also identified to be associated with WPV among HPs.",

When we reviewed these publications about WPV worldwide, we could easily find gender differences in the prevalence of WPV against HPs. However, the results were conflicting. Some studies supported the higher prevalence of WPV among male healthcare professionals (MHPs) (20) (21) (22) , and some studies supported the higher prevalence of WPV among female healthcare professionals (FHPs) (23) . Some studies reported there were no differences between MHPs and FHPs (24) . As we know, the occupational classifications of medical professionals in Chinese hospitals, like many other hospitals in the world, are highly segregated by gender. For example, there are more females among nurses, and there are more males among surgeons. The association between gender discrimination and WPV among HPs was also supported in the previous study (25) . On the other side, gender differences are also one of the characteristics of Confucianism in China. For men, they mainly undertake the economic responsibility in their family, and they may be influenced by the work-related factors. For women, they mainly take care of their families, and they may be influenced by their family events. The differences may result from the different outcomes of WPV between MHPs and FHPs. All of these remind us that there should be some gender differences for WPV toward HPs in China.",

The findings can give us important implications for the policies and interventions of WPV against HPs.

First, we randomly selected three municipalities from all the 17 municipalities in Shandong province. Second, in each of the selected municipalities, three counties/districts were randomly selected. Third, one municipal hospital was randomly selected from each of the municipalities, and one county-level/district-level hospital was selected from these counties or districts. Totally, three municipal hospitals and nine county-level/district-level hospitals were selected to conduct the survey in this study. In the municipal hospitals, we selected three inpatient areas from each department. In the county-level/district-level hospitals, we selected two inpatient areas from each department. The inclusion criteria of the HPs were the ones who had signed the labor contracts with the selected hospitals. HPs who were receiving training in the selected hospitals were excluded from this study. Finally, there were 3,426 valid questionnaires, which were analyzed in this study.

The gender difference for the responses to WPV was supported, and it was not statistically significant for PV, VV, and BPV. Several factors associated with WPV among MHPs and FHPs were also found in this study, such as education and depression. For MHPs, lower income levels and managers were at a higher risk of WPV, and more working hours were associated with a higher risk of WPV among FHPs. The first finding of the higher prevalence of WPV among MHPs was not new. As we mentioned above, previous studies also supported the higher prevalence of WPV among MHPs in China (40, 41) . However, there were some studies, which reported a higher prevalence of WPV among FHPs in Western countries (23, 24, 42) . The reason may be explained by the Chinese traditional culture about the weak position of women in their workplaces, and they are relatively less to be treated as targets of WPV. In this study, we also reported a lower prevalence of WPV (47.8%), compared with previous findings (about 60%) in China (41) . It may be caused by the recent reforms in the Chinese healthcare system and medical education, which was discussed in the previous study (43) .",

One of the reasons may be that most of the WPV against HPs are not very serious to HPs, and the HPs do not need to take action the response. The other reason may be that being silent may be one of the best choices to control further harm from WPV. For FHPs, silence may be a better choice because of their weak status in physical strength.",

These negative outcomes of healthcare services may result in WPV from these patients' relatives. Actually, the positive association between depression and WPV had been identified in previous studies (50) .

As we know, in Chinese families and traditional culture, men should take more responsibility in their families than women, and this makes them may care about their income. In this situation, a lower income level may result from a higher level of job burnout (53) , which is also a risk factor for WPV (54, 55) . For male managers, they need to deal with more problems about WPV than females in their hospitals or departments because of the culture of female protection, which makes them at higher risk of WPV.",
