            "text": "Bivalve molluscan shellfish like clams and oysters, etc., are capable to bioaccumulate surrounding contaminants from waters into their digestive systems and posing serious threats of food poisoning. Detection of rotaviruses (RVs) in shellfish is of particular importance because RVs are prone to genome reassortment resulting in the emergence of new RV variants that may compromise vaccine safety. Herein, we have detected the wild-type RVs and Rotarix/RotaTeq vaccine strains in freshwater clams collected on the riverside, Kawasaki city, from July 2019 to January 2020 and correlated the detected genotypes with that of gastroenteritis cases of nearby clinics to understand the transmission of RVs in the environment. The wild-type RVs were detected in 62 (64.6%) out of 96 freshwater clams in every study month: July, September, November, and January that are considered as off-season for RV infections. The most frequent genotypes were G2 (42.9%), G8 (28.6%), G3 (14.3%), G1 (7.1%), and G10 (7.1%), which remained comparable with genotypic distribution found in the clinical samples over the last few years indicating that these RVs may accumulate in clams since a long time. However, G10 genotype was detected in clam but not in clinical samples suggesting the presence of asymptomatic infection or RVs could be carried out from a long distance. Importantly, vaccine strains, RotaTeq (1%) but not Rotarix (0%), were also detected in a clam. Attention must be paid to monitoring the potential transmission of wild-type and vaccine RV strains in the environment to prevent the emergence of new variants generated from genome reassortment with vaccine strains.",

To prevent severe RV illness, two live attenuated oral RV-vaccines, Rotarix (GlaxoSmithKline, Rixensart, Belgium) and RotaTeq (Merck & Co., Whitehouse Station, NJ, USA) were recommended by World Health Organization (WHO) to be introduced in every country since 2009 (WHO, 2019 ). Yet, RVs were found responsible, mostly in developing countries, for an estimated 258 million diarrheal cases and 128,515 deaths annually worldwide among children < 5 years while 228,047 deaths among all ages (GBD, 2016 Diarrhoeal Disease Collaborators, 2018 . However, the death toll remained as high as 453,000 among children younger than 5 years in 2008 when RV-vaccines were not implemented widely (Tate et al., 2012; WHO, 2019) . In fact, RV-vaccines played a dramatic role in reducing disease severity, hospitalizations, and mortality in RV infection through providing a broad heterotypic immunity because of RV's cross-reactivity (Burnett et al., 2017; Hoque et al., 2018a Hoque et al., , 2018b Kawata et al., 2021) . However, RV infection yet remains unpreventable not only because of RV's genotype diversity and reassortment capability but also for its highly contagious nature (Hoque et al., 2018a (Hoque et al., , 2018b (Hoque et al., , 2019a (Hoque et al., , 2019b . Not only children but also adults could be infected and can spread the virus though the illness may remain less severe or asymptomatic in adults (Anses, 2012; Snelling et al., 2011) . A large number of RVs are shed through the stool of infected persons and spread out easily via contaminated food, unwashed hands, and contaminated inanimate objects like toys, towels, etc. (Stanford Children's Health, 2021; Victoria et al., 2014) .",

Recently, rotavirus vaccines (2 doses of Rotarix or 3 doses of RotaTeq) have been included in the national vaccination program of Japan from October 1, 2020 (Kawata et al., 2021) . The average RV-vaccine coverage was 47.6% until the end of 2014 which has been increased gradually in the following years (Kawata et al., 2021) . Rotarix is administered in 2 oral doses: 1st at 6-14 weeks and with 4 weeks' interval 2nd within 24 weeks, while RotaTeq is administered in 3 oral doses: 1st at 6-14 weeks and with 4 weeks' interval from each 2nd and 3rd doses by 32 weeks. These are live vaccines that can replicate in vaccinees and are shed in feces which is more common after the first dose from 1 to 15 days post-vaccination (Anderson, 2008) . This shedding could be prolonged as long as 360 days after the last dose in immunocompromised patients (Patel et al., 2010) . RV-vaccine strains have been shown highly stable in the aquatic environment (Gautam et al., 2014) . Therefore, shedding of the vaccine viruses may cause transmission of live vaccine viruses from vaccinated to unvaccinated children resulting in a potential threat of vaccine-associated diseases, especially, in immunocompromised individuals (Yen et al., 2011) . Previously, RotaTeq vaccine-acquired RV infection was reported among children with severe combined immunodeficiency disorder (Werther et al., 2009) . Again, vaccine viruses may reassort with other strains to produce reassortants that may remain associated with acute gastroenteritis (AGE) (Gautam et al., 2014) . Such reassortants derived from the RotaTeq vaccine strain and wild-type human RV strains have been detected in AGE cases (Bucardo et al., 2012) . Accumulation of RVvaccine viruses in shellfish thus possess potential health risk and needs to be investigated.",

Table 1 , twenty-four clams were collected per study month and investigated for wild-type RVs and RVvaccine strains. Among total 96 clams, wild-type RVs were clams, average Ct value \u00b1 standard deviation was 32.2 \u00b1 0.9) clams were detected RV-positive in July 2019 followed by 75% (18 out of 24, Ct: 33.95 \u00b1 1.2) in November 2019, 51.2% (13 out of 24, Ct: 34.2 \u00b1 1.5) in January 2020, and 37.5% (9 out of 24, Ct: 34.8 \u00b1 0.8) in September 2019. However, the detection of vaccine strain did not correlate with the number of wild-type viruses detected. Single clam positive for RotaTeq vaccine virus was detected in November 2019 (Table 1) with Ct value 36 indicating clearly positive. The copy number was separately evaluated in this clam and determined 1-2 copies/clam. No Rotarix vaccine strain was detected in the study. G-genotyping analysis suggested that RVs detected in clams were of G1, G2, G3, G8, and G10 genotypes (Fig. 1) . To find out the relationship between RVs in clams and gastroenteritis cases, we collected the information of the last few years of RV detection in the children of nearby Kawasaki City Institute for Public Health. As shown in Fig. 1 , the RV season in clinical samples existed from February to June, while RVs were detected in clams from July to January (Table 1) . The most frequent genotype in clams were G2 (6 out of 14, 42.9%), followed by G8 (4 out of 14, 28.6%), G3 (2 out of 14, 14.3%), G1 (1 out of 14, 7.1%) and G10 (1 out of 14, 7.1%). Interestingly, similar genotypic distribution was observed in the clinical samples of nearby clinics when investigated from 2017 to 2020: G2 (16 out of 47, 34.0%), followed by G8 (14 out of 47, 29.8%), G3 (10 out of 47, 21.3%), G9 (4 out of 47, 8.5%) and G1 (3 out of 47, 6.4%). Thus, the predominating genotypes in clams and clinical samples of the last few years seem associated. However, the genotypes predominated in the clinical samples in that particular study year (2019-2020) were G8 (13 out of 22, 59.1%) followed by G3 (4 out of 22, 18.2%), G9 (3 out of 22, 13.6%), G1 (1 out of 22, 4.5%) and G2 (1 out of 22, 4.5%), not looked properly associated with the genotypes in clams.",

The detection of RVs in clams in all detection months (July, September, November, and January) suggested that RVs may remain present in shellfish in all seasons including the off-season of RV infection.

Here, we did not use the pooling method because we aimed to detect wild-type/vaccine RV strain from individual clams. The primers and probes used here for selective detection of Rotarix and RotaTeq vaccine strains were very specific to Rotarix NSP2 and RotaTeq VP6 genes, respectively, that were developed and validated by Gautam et al. (2014) exhibiting 100% sensitivity, 98.6-99% specificity, 92.5-96% PPV, 99-100% NPV with 91-94% efficiency and 1-2 copies limit of detection toward selectively detecting target vaccine strains. Here, the Ct value of the single RotaTeq-positive clam was 36 indicating clearly positive and the copy number was evaluated 1-2 copies in the clam. RV-vaccines are used in all months. So, vaccine strain could be found at any month. Nevertheless, vaccine strains were detected fewer than wild-type strains, probably because disposable baby diapers are widely used in developed countries for infants younger than 6 months when vaccine doses are administered.",

However, conventional RT-PCR remained less sensitive than real-time RT-PCR, and all RV-positive samples did not yield clear amplicons of the VP7 region for sequence-based genotyping. Genotypes detected in clams remained comparable with those detected in AGE cases of nearby clinics of the last few years but not with that particular year only. However, the G10 genotype detected in clams was not found in clinical samples. Thus, the data of genotypic analysis of clams and clinical samples raised several possibilities: 1. RV strains of previous years may persist in clams for a long time, 2. strains from asymptomatic infected individuals can be accumulated, 3. RVs, not only from nearby areas but also from a long distance across, may be carried away by river water and accumulate in the clams in bay areas.",

Our data suggest that RVs from infected patients, either symptomatic or asymptomatic, or from long distances can be accumulated in bivalve mollusks and can persist for a long time. The shellfish of off-season also may remain contaminated with RVs and may remain responsible for the next seasonal RV outbreak. Furthermore, we provided evidence of the accumulation of vaccine strains in bivalve mollusks that pose a threat of unexpected infections and virus genomic reassortments. Although the detection rate of vaccine strains in clams remained low in Japan, it may vary in other countries. Further studies are required to understand the viability and whether this bioaccumulation and bioconcentration of bivalve mollusks have any stimulating role in genetic reassortment.",
