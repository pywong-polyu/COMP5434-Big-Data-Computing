It provides commentary on this definition, and presents five contextual factors that need to be considered when applying bioethics norms to a biopharmaceutical industry setting: (1) dual missions; (2) timely and pragmatic guidance; (3) resource stewardship; (4) multiple stakeholders; and (5) operational complexity.",

As life sciences research and clinical care become increasingly complex, the biopharmaceutical enterprise frequently faces issues with important ethical implications that may not be fully addressed by public policy or industry guidelines. Current examples include access to medicines, drug shortages; use of human biological samples; genomics; use of \"big data\"; personalized medicine; quality of life and regenerative medicines; data transparency; research in low resource settings; clinical trial diversity; and most recently, the conduct of clinical trials during a pandemic. Systematic analysis and application of ethics standards provides needed guidance for 'gray areas' like these topics that lack specific policy or guidelines.",

Clinical informed consent focuses on the risks and benefits of individual patient treatment. Clinical research informed consent focuses on an individual's well-being within the setting of a clinical trial and its associated risks and benefits. Public health informed consent focuses on an individual's well-being in the context of a societal intervention and its associated risks and benefits.",

In order for this additional content to be meaningful, it is important to understand the scope and context to which bioethics norms are to be applied. Bioethics as applied to a biopharmaceutical industry setting often is construed either too broadly (merged into a general discussion of ethics) or too narrowly (limited to research ethics) with little examination of its proper scope. Given the influence of the biopharmaceutical industry and the ongoing scrutiny of its ethics, it is necessary to consider how bioethics as a discipline (distinct from but complementary to legal compliance and business ethics) relates to this influential sector of the global healthcare system.

The former addresses general business conduct and the latter addresses corporate culture and processes. Applied ethics domains are not necessarily mutually exclusive and should be integrated when appropriate, including integration with professional codes of conduct (e.g., medicine, nursing, science, etc.). As explained by Drews [25] , the obligations derived from medical, scientific or corporate codes of ethics \"are not incompatible a priori\" (p. 27), but they can conflict with each other in important ways. A physician or scientist in a corporate setting can find it challenging to be bound by all three. Facilitating such integration takes intentional, system-wide effort that acknowledges the challenges. 'Research' refers to scientific activities that precede or support human clinical trials of a novel investigational biopharmaceutical product or line extension (i.e., new use) for an already-approved healthcare product. This includes basic research, drug discovery and preclinical testing [28] . The focus of research is to identify, evaluate and optimize molecular or biologic entities. Once an entity demonstrates sufficient pharmacological activity and is deemed safe enough to test in humans, then it becomes a 'candidate' product and moves to clinical development.",

A related argument is that a profit motive at least should be tempered-because healthcare products are inherently different from other products due to their consumable nature, and because patients have potential vulnerabilities that reduce their ability to make autonomous decisions (e.g., vulnerabilities due to the disease, treatment, emotions, relationship power differentials, or lack of choice or access) [37, 38] . Alternatively, some have proposed that (a) profit is a virtue because it fuels an enterprise from which many benefit [11] ; (b) a commercially competitive biopharmaceutical industry is the best option for developing safe and effective healthcare products [39] ; (c) there is no morally relevant distinction between biopharmaceutical companies and businesses that produce other commodities [40] ; and (d) profitability is acceptable as long as the societal benefits are deemed substantial enough to balance the monetary gain. Society's willingness for an industry to make a profit from the misfortune of ill-health has been referred to as \"the grand bargain\" [41, 42] .",

The challenge is how to ethically manage dual responsibilities to make a profit and contribute to society's common good. The literature is replete with discussion on the topic of balancing these dual missions. This paper does not aim to resolve the issue, nevertheless, we share several pragmatic ways it can be addressed. First, there needs to be a corporate commitment to bioethics. Operationalizing this commitment falls under the applied ethics domain of organization ethics. There are a number of operational models that can be adapted for an industry setting [12, 13, 27, [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] , depending on available resources. Whichever model is chosen, a concerted educational effort to make bioethics part of daily discussion facilitates the incorporation of norms into business decisions-serving as an important ballast to commercial factors. It is prudent to keep the bioethics effort organizationally separate from R&D or business units to manage internal bias for specific research efforts or product decisions [18] . Soliciting external expert input is another important exercise for navigating challenging issues; although the professional ethics of this practice is debated due to conflicts of interest and potential corporate pressure to tailor advice to commercial desires [5, [48] [49] [50] [51] . Some, however, think the legitimate need for advice can be managed with methodology to mitigate these risks [5, 52, 53] .",

Are the medical/scientific/societal needs great enough to consider additional clinical trials despite initially failed attempts (e.g., Alzheimer's disease treatment research)? Appropriately managing failure encompasses balancing bioethics responsibilities to multiple stakeholders.",

The industry has an inherently complex network of varied stakeholdersboth internal and external to its operations. A possible (but not exhaustive) list includes patients, patient advocates, research participants and collaborators, independent researchers, business partners, vendors, healthcare practitioners, payers, regulators, healthcare authorities, local communities, policy makers, employees, and investors. Because the industry is but one of many members in a modern healthcare system, a company may have limited ability to directly affect an issue involving multiple parties. Nevertheless, it is a key participant and stakeholders have high expectations that it should uphold its responsibilities across its broad scope of influence. Therefore, discernment of industry-specific roles and responsibilities and how to address them is a fundamental part of bioethics deliberation.",

Figure 2 depicts a framework to appreciate categories of patients from a clinical trial perspective that may be impacted by a bioethics issue. There can be up to six categories of patients whose medical needs and contributions to research must be considered and prioritized. Identifying patient categories relevant to an issue is an effective way to ensure comprehensive bioethics deliberations. Appreciating the stories of individual patients within these categories is an Fig. 2 Patient categories. There are two patient categories that must be considered when assessing bioethical responsibilities of the biopharmaceutical industry-current and future patients. Within the category of current patients, there are two subcategories-those for which there is not a clinical trial and those for which there is a clinical trial. Within the latter category, there are four additional subcategories. Most biopharmaceutical bioethics deliberations require consideration of at least two or more categories or subcategories effective method for avoiding group generalizations [61, 62] . The needs of each relevant group can be evaluated in light of clinical trials factors, such as phase of development, severity of the indication under study, and availability of treatment options.",

This topic increasingly is generating bioethical debate in the public and private policy arena, most notably in the United States [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] . The debate centers on whether a biopharmaceutical company has an ethical obligation to provide investigational product to patients with a serious or life-threatening disease who have exhausted treatment options. The ethical tension is that company resources are focused on active R&D efforts designed to help future patients with specific indications, but current patients with serious conditions may not be able to wait for a new product approval. Diverting effort away from clinical trials may delay product access for current and future patients waiting for innovative treatment. However, not providing immediate access to an individual could adversely affect the well-being of that patient. The number of stakeholders with interests in this issue is extensive and highlights the need to delineate industry's role and responsibility(s) to provide treatment outside of clinical trials [68] .",

Commentary on the scope of this definition explains that companies have ethical responsibilities to both individuals and society, which extend throughout the product lifecycle. To address these responsibilities, biopharmaceutical bioethics engages with research, clinical and public health ethics. Application of bioethics norms can occur at a company guidance level and at a case-specific level. Deliberations should incorporate both bioethics and company values and principles.
