The various prediction algorithms are being used to capture the MHC peptide binding preference, allowing the rapid scan of entire pathogen proteomes for peptide likely to bind MHC, saving the cost, effort, and time. However, the number of known binders/non-binders (BNB) to a specific MHC molecule is limited in many cases, which still poses a computational challenge for prediction. The training data should be adequate to predict BNB using any machine learning approach. In this study, variable learning rate has been demonstrated for training artificial neural network and predicting BNB for small datasets. The approach can be used for large datasets as well. The dataset for different MHC class I alleles for SARS Corona virus (Tor2 Replicase polyprotein 1ab) has been used for training and prediction of BNB. A total of 90 datasets (nine different MHC class I alleles with tenfold cross validation) have been retrieved from IEDB database for BNB. For fixed learning rate approach, the best value of AROC is 0.65, and in most of the cases it is 0.5, which shows the poor predictions. In case of variable learning rate, of the 90 datasets the value of AROC for 76 datasets is between 0.806 and 1.0 and for 7 datasets the value is between 0.7 and 0.8 and for rest of 7 datasets it is between 0.5 and 0.7, which indicates very good performance in most of the cases.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Cytotoxic T cells of the immune system monitor cells for infection by viruses, or intracellular bacteria through scanning their surface for peptides bound to MHC class I molecules [1] .

T cells do not recognize soluble native antigen but rather recognize antigens that has been processed into antigenic peptides, which are presented in combination with MHC molecules. It has been observed that peptides of nine amino acid residues (9-mers) bind most strongly; peptides of 8-11 residues also bind but generally with lower affinity than nonamers [3, 4] .

Back propagation network learns using a method of gradient descent to search for a set of weights that can model the given classification problem, so as to minimize the mean squared distance between the network's class prediction and the actual class label of the samples. The learning rate helps to avoid getting stuck at local minimum in the decision space (i.e., where the weights appear to converge, but are not the optimum solution) and encourages finding the global minimum. If the learning rate is too small, then learning will occur at a very slow pace. If the learning rate is too large, then oscillation between inadequate solutions may occur [17, 18] . In gradient descent, learning rate determines the magnitude of the change to be made in the parameters, i.e., weights and a bias of nodes as per (1) and (2); furthermore, the updated weights and biases are given by (3) and (4). The value of error (Err j ) at output node and at internal node is given by (5) and (6), respectively. The input and output to each j-th unit are given by (7) and (8), respectively. For a given training set of input vectors, the learning rate L is kept fixed which leads to poor convergence in case of a small dataset. To improve the convergence, variable learning rate (i.e., the learning rate is updated after each input vector in a given training set of input vectors) has been used as per (9) . The error is calculated using (5) after each training vector, and the learning rate is increased by a value a, if the error on the subsequent training vector decreases.
