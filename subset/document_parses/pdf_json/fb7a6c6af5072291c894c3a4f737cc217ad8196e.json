However, doing intersectional HCI work is uniquely expensive: it leads to a combinatorial explosion of empirical work (expense 1), and little of the work on one intersectional population can be leveraged to serve another (expense 2). In this paper, we explain how representations employed by certain analytical design methods correspond to type abstractions, and use that correspondence to identify a (de)compositional model in which a population's diverse identity properties can be joined and split. We formally prove the model's correctness, and show how it enables HCI designers to harness existing analytical HCI methods for use on new intersectional populations of interest. We illustrate through four design use-cases, how the model can reduce the amount of expense 1 and enable designers to leverage prior work to new intersectional populations, addressing expense 2.",

Such one-dimensional approaches have been insufficient at understanding and supporting people with certain combinations of multiple, intersecting identities [17, 25, 52, 53] . A well-known example is the facial recognition failure rate for Black women [8, 9] , in which facial recognition systems achieved high accuracy when predicting between gender (Figure 1a ), or skin color (Figure 1b ), but these one-dimensional comparisons did not reveal the huge lack of support for dark-skinned women ( Figure 1c ).",

            "text": "At the heart of the need for intersectional HCI is the fact that some intersectional populations have much less representation than others in the decisions designers make. Returning to the facial recognition example, relatively few data points from the intersectional population of dark-skinned women were collected for the lower-right quadrant of Figure 1 (c) [9] , so that intersectional population had relatively little influence on the system's ultimate efficacy. In contrast, the intersectional population of light-skinned men was overrepresented in the formative and in the evaluation data. Not surprisingly, the system's efficacy for that intersectional population was very high [9] . This suggests that a key to reducing the expense of serving intersectional populations is finding ways to give every intersectional population an equal voice-despite the challenges of getting access to an equal number of data points for each such population. This is where type abstraction, borrowed from programming language theory, can help. A type in a programming language stands for all possible values of that type. For example, type Integer stands for all possible integer values, and in the example of Figure 1 , type Skin Color stands for all possible skin color values. Types thus provide equal representation to every value of a type.",

However, the Court's research failed to identify such discrimination, because General Motors had hired white women and Black men and the research neglected the complained race and gender discrimination that Black women experience [17, 65] .

She then evaluated the accuracy of three AI classifiers (Microsoft, Face++, and IBM) intersectionally using the PPB dataset. She showed that giving attention to equal representation in training data in each intersectional group resulted in higher accuracy than what other datasets had been able to achieve [7, 9] .

Thus, for ordinal facet types satisfying the assumptions of Section 4, the type-based analyses can't miss an error. Erring on the safe side, the type-based analysis might report an error when the value-based analysis might not, but this is exactly the behavior we need because when an error is found for one of the extreme values, it is a relevant error that could be missed by a value-based analysis that did not happen to test with that value.",

For example, a practitioner trying to address the needs of elderly, low-SES women, can analyze their prototype via AgeMag [44] , then via SESMag [35] , then via GenderMag [10] . The practitioner can then compose (take the union of) the issues found separately with AgeMag, SESMag, and GenderMag, to obtain inclusivity issues that elderly women in low socio-economic situations will face, as well as those faced by people in the other intersections of these three diversity dimensions. 5 Accumulating the results in this way is justified by applying the theorem backward. Use case #2: Divide-and-Conquer by a team for complex evaluations: By the same token, a team of HCI practitioners could divide-and-conquer a multi-dimensional analysis by splitting it into different dimensions, with different subteams doing the analysis on the different dimensions. For example, one subteam might do the AgeMag analysis while another does the GenderMag analysis, and so on. In fact, a team could even divide up the work of a single iMag analysis. For example, one subteam might do an analysis in terms of only the first three facet types, with another subteam focusing on the remainder of the facet types. Doing so might help ward off the facet popularity phenomenon, in which a team habituates to considering certain facet types and tends to neglect others (as reported in [11] ).",

It uses extreme values of each population trait (e.g., high and low self-efficacy) to give HCI designers a process by which to ensure that the software simultaneously supports individuals at each end of each trait's range of values. These traits are chosen with the assumption that it is sufficient to design for the two endpoints of the scale, such as for people with both high and low technology self-efficacy, since solutions that simultaneously support both ends of the ordered range also support values within the range.2 How can we apply InclusiveMag to a multidimensional population of possible identities? Prior intersectionality works have shown the insufficiency of considering, for example, gender and socioeconomic status separately. But to specifically consider a sufficient sample of all the possible facet value combinations a person could have, one would have to consider the needs of on the order of 2 kinds of people to handle traits.Figure 5illustrates the problem; if a design team who can afford to do a fixed number of investigations tries to consider the needs of individuals with many facet values across many dimensions, their sampling becomes less and less adequate, spread more and more thinly through the multi-dimensional space of possible traits.InclusiveMag-generated methods address the expense of the need for multiple investigations with people with different traits(Figure 5a) by: (1) identifying facet types (i.e., range of possible values of a human trait) that tend to differ (statistically) along some identity spectrum, and (2) eliminating inclusivity bugs that affect people at both ends of each facet type's range of possible values. The intersectional approach we describe below extends this technique to multiple dimensions(Figure 5b,c). In the following section, we describe the space of intersectional design in terms of sets of facet types, and show that adding dimensions of intersectionality means adding, not multiplying, facet types to consider, making intersectional analysis tractable for a design team with limited resources.",

Each facet type Facet is an ordered set of all possible values of that type, whose minimum and maximum values are denoted by max(Facet) and min(Facet), respectively.The purpose of iMag(Dim) is to analyze a software use case's inclusivity across the diversity dimension Dim.iMag(Dim) works by examining a set of states State = {state 1 , . . . , state } of the software use case for two contrasting, extreme values, for each of the facet types. These contrasting extreme values are usually captured by personas. To cover the complete space of all facet values, the two personas are designed so that they each represent the opposite extreme values for every facet type. A Dim-persona is thus defined as a set of facet values {facet 1 , . . . , facet } with facet \u2208 {max(Facet ), min(Facet )}.The designers' task is now to use their iMag-generated method to find inclusivity issues in their software. They examine a state state \u2208 State through the lens of an extreme facet value-min(Facet ) or max(Facet )-and then potentially identify one or more issues of type Issue. This single analysis step can be formally represented by a function spot : Facet \u00d7 State \u2192 2 Issue that takes a facet value and a state and returns a set of issues.3 For a given persona persona = {facet 1 , . . . , facet }, iMag(Dim) applies spot(facet, state) for each facet value facet \u2208 persona and state state \u2208 State.4 To simplify the following definition, we define the function spot, which identifies all issues for both extreme facet values of a facet type and a particular state.spot(Facet, state) = spot(min(Facet), state) \u222a spot(max(Facet), state) With spot we can now formally define the function iMag, which collects for a dimension Dim and a set of states State all issues identified by spot.

The last category of intersectional HCI research analytically studies the oppressions, misconceptions, and fallacies that are upheld when designing software for users with intersectional social identities. This category relies on oppression and intersectionality theories by Patricia Hill Collins and Kimberle Crenshaw, and is profoundly rooted in social work and women's studies. An example of this category is the Anti-Oppressive Design Framework introduced by Symth et al. to guide the understanding and responses to the complexity of the experiences of intersectional users[61] in both the things we create and the environments in which we design. Current intersectional-HCI analytical studies center around several questions that individuals at the decision-making table should ask, such as:Fig. 4. Reporting the accuracy of facial recognition classifiers (i.e., Microsoft, Face ++, and IBM) along social categories (i.e., skin color and gender) is significant to highlight the disparities within subgroups. Note that darker-skinned individuals are less likely to be classified than lighter-skinned individuals, and darker-skinned females are less likely to be classified than lighter-skinned males and females.[7] What oppression would this work strive to eliminate? At what level? and At which intersections?[61] Am I thinking about everyone as I am designing this tool?
