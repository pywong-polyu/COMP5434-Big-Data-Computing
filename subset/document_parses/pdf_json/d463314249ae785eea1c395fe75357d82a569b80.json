Our goal is to better understand and detect the physiological and behavioral indicators of implicit biases. This paper investigates whether we can reliably detect racial bias from physiological responses, including heart rate, conductive skin response, skin temperature, and micro-body movements. We analyzed data from 46 subjects whose physiological data was collected with Empatica E4 wristband while taking an Implicit Association Test (IAT). Our machine learning and statistical analysis show that implicit bias can be predicted from physiological signals with 76.1% accuracy. Our results also show that the EDA signal associated with skin response has the strongest correlation with racial bias and that there are significant differences between the values of EDA features for biased and unbiased participants.",

People can hold biases against or for others based on characteristics such as the individual's age, gender, gender identity, physical abilities, religion, sexual orientation, or weight [14] . Due to their automatic and unintentional nature -and often unrecognized impact on judgment and behavior -implicit biases can lead people, even those most committed to egalitarian ideals, to be unsuspecting perpetrators of discrimination. Existing bias interventions have two primary shortcomings: (1) they have been designed as \"one-shot\", \"one size fits all\" solutions and (2) they have not successfully aided individuals in identifying bias-triggering contexts or situations as they occur in real time. These shortcomings are in large part due to the difficulty and lack of feasibility of assessing or detecting bias as it manifests itself in daily life.",

For example, a participant is described as having an unconscious bias towards white appearing faces if they are faster at completing the task when white faces are paired with words like \"good\" and Black appearing faces are paired with words like \"bad.\" Based on the differences in participants' speed in pairing faces and evaluations in Black-good/White-bad and Black-bad/White-good conditions, participants are categorized as having no bias, a slight bias, a moderate bias, or a strong bias [12] . A meta-analysis of 122 studies of the IAT found that the predictive validity of the IAT is greater for social sensitive topics, such as race, where the test has greater predictive validity for bias than self-report measures [11] . Even small differences between individuals on the IAT have been linked to differences in discrimination in hiring, in salary, in criminal proceedings, in school discipline and grading, and in health care decisions [10] . What the IAT fails to tell us, however, is whether there are also physiological responses associated with bias.",

Prior work has begun to establish one avenue for such interventions: the linking of unconscious bias activation with distinct patterns of concomitant physiological activity, patterns that are consistent with threat responses in intergroup contexts. Researchers have found that learned threat responses to outgroup members are indicated by distinct patterns of neural activity (e.g., amygdala activation: [3, 4] ); cardiovascular reactivity [6, 13] ; and skin conductance [8] ). For example, the intensity of participants' neural activity is related to differences in assessed levels of prejudice. Participants' anterior cingulate cortex activity is greater for participants with more assessed prejudice than their less prejudiced peers when they are asked to engage in a labelling activity after being shown Black appearing faces [5] . Similarly, in another study, when participants were confronted with individuals who appeared Asian, but had Southern American accents, the participants demonstrated unusual cardiovascular responses, had poorer task performance, and manifested negative and defeat-related behaviors [6] . In studies of bias against individuals with mental illness, researchers found that the reactions and decisions of participants when interacting with individuals with mental health concerns were correlated with skin conductance measures, indicating a possible relationship between skin conductance measures and bias [8] .",

We used XGBoost, a machine learning ensemble meta-algorithm that uses decision trees as base-learner algorithms, under the framework of Bootstrap Aggregation (Bagging) and Boosting mechanisms. This method can also report the ranking of each feature from its average importance and its contribution to the algorithm's decision-making process. Since the number of biased and unbiased participants was imbalanced (26 biased vs. 20 unbiased), we applied oversampling technology in the leave-one-participant-out cross validation to balance the number of participants in both groups. We divided the signal stream of each sensor into 5 second intervals and extracted features as discussed in previous sections. We used this short time window to capture fine-grained and micro features from data. This process generated a dataset of 5-second samples as rows and sensor features as columns. We then applied our machine learning algorithms on the 5-second sample dataset in a leave-one-person-out cross validation. This approach classified each 5-second sample of each participant's data into the two labels of 0 (unbiased) or 1 (biased). The process resulted in sequences of 0 and 1s for each participant (see Figure 1 ). We developed an algorithm to iteratively smooth the sequence and generate consecutive blocks of 0 and 1 labels. First, the sequence was parsed and blocks of labels with length of 1 were replaced with the neighboring majority label on both sides. For example, 1101 was smoothed to 1111. Then segments with length of 2 were checked and smoothed in the same way. The process continued until either at most three consecutive windows were created or the frequencies of the remaining segments were greater than the mean value of the original segments' frequencies. We then chose the label that had the largest consecutive block in the sequence as the final label. This strategy generated the ranking of features during the cross validation. We further analyzed the set of features that had a high importance rate in more than half of the iterations. To measure the performance of the algorithms, we calculated accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall statistics for the biased and unbiased groups. ",

In addition to the accuracy of classifying biased vs. unbiased samples, we wanted to identify temporal patterns that might emerge in participants' physiology during the IAT. With the ratio of majority class (biased samples) as baseline (56.5%), our results indicated that XGBoost provided an overall accuracy of 19.6% above the baseline respectively (Accuracy = 76.1% and F1 =75.8%,). The algorithms could accurately label the majority of samples belonging to the biased class (Recall of 76.9%) compared to the unbiased class, which was expected given that the majority of the samples belong to the biased class. The higher impact of accurate classification of samples in the biased class to some degree compensates for more false negatives in the unbiased samples (Recall of 75%). Figure 2 shows the features that had highest ratings in the majority of the iterations during the cross-validation. We only show the features with the frequency above 23, which is half the number of participants (46). The majority of those features were from the EDA signals.",

The EDA measures of skin conductivity had the strongest related to bias. The EDA measures constituted the majority of highly ranked features, and the EDA measure of standard deviation differed the most between the biased and unbiased groups. Further, the increase in participants' physiological reactions over the duration of the IAT indicates that bias responses themselves might increase over prolonged interactions, which has important practical implications for designing bias interventions. Our findings on skin conductivity demonstrate the need for more research on physiological indicators and bias, so that we can learn if this finding is limited to just the race IAT, just these participants, or if the finding is broadly true for more biases, situations, and samples.",

The sample for this study consists of only 46 students, and the findings might vary with a larger sample. In addition, the small sample size created a severe class imbalance and limited our ability to do multi-class classification to infer different levels of bias. While we mitigated this problem by grouping the data samples into two categories of biased and unbiased, ideally, we would only use data samples that were labeled as highly biased or not biased to have a clear distinction between the two categories, as would be possible with a larger sample. Further, the data we collected came when students were taking the IAT and not when they were in everyday situations where bias might be triggered. The Covid-19 pandemic interrupted the planned data collection and the next steps for research are to both collect data from more participants and to collect data when participants are engaged in real or simulated environments that might trigger bias to confirm the real-world applications of the work.",
