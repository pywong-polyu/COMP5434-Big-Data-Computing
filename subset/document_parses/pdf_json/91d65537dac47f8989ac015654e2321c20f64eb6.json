Fifty-nine percent 136 (84/141) of positive patients received their care at Yale New Haven Hospital, 24.1% (34/141) at 137 Bridgeport Hospital and 16.3% (23/141) at Greenwich Hospital. The median age of the cohort 138 was 30 years (IQR 25-34) (Table 1). The median pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) was 139 28.4 kg/m 2 (IQR 24.1-35.1). Forty-four percent (61/141) of women were Hispanic, 27.3% 140 (38/141) were non-Hispanic white, 21.6% (30/141) were non-Hispanic black, and 7.2% (10/141) 141 were of Asian or other race.

Comparison of race/ethnicity breakdown between SARS-CoV-2 145 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f positive and negative groups revealed overrepresentation of Hispanic women in the positive 146 cohort, p<0.001.
