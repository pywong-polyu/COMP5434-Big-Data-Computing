Specifically, construction needs to be constantly aware of safety and risk balanced with timely project delivery. Guidance for COVID-19 must therefore be implemented in a way that reflects working practice and pressures. There is, however, a potential knowledge gap regarding the practical feasibility and impact of applying COVID-19 measures within construction, made more difficult by factors such as the temporary nature of projects and complex working arrangements. This article presents a commentary on safe construction during, and beyond, COVID-19, covering the human factors challenges and practicalities of implementing COVID-19 measures. We observe that while guidance is strong on risk management, understanding of how best to implement this guidance",

Also, care must be taken that implementing guidance does not detract from general safety, which is also challenged by increased pressures on delivery arising from COVID-19. There may, however, be opportunities for safer working practice arising from new awareness of health, hygiene, and safety risk. The role of safety leadership is overlooked in guidance yet is vital to ensure safe application of COVID-19 working practices. The key message is that COVID-19 needs to be integrated and promoted within a general risk management approach, in part because this takes account of differing priorities regarding safety risks, rather than overly focussing on COVID-19, and also because the effectiveness of COVID-19 mitigations can be amplified by integration with pre-existing safety processes.",

Sites have had to adjust to social distancing, implementing new hygiene and personal protective equipment (PPE) measures, and accommodating a greater level of working from home for roles that are not essential to front-line work. The importance of health and hygiene, as well as safety, has never been clearer. All of this has had to occur while maintaining safety in the conventional aspects of work, in a sector which ordinarily has multiple hazards. Delivering safety is a significant challenge (Health and Safety Executive [HSE] , 2019; van der Molen et al., 2018) , especially where multiple organizations of different sizes work together, as is typically found in medium to large construction projects (Pe\u00f1aloza et al., 2020; Rowlinson, 2004; Stiles et al., 2012; Woolley et al., 2020) .

A PDO is established with a number of companies, co-ordinated via contractual obligations, for a determined period of time (Rowlinson, 2004) ; key duty holders being the client, principal contractors, and the supply chain. Table 1 presents an example of a medium-sized PDO and some of the key characteristics (this is an anonymized aggregation of six pre-COVID-19 projects). These projects are highly dynamic, increasing in total numbers of people on site and numbers of sub-contractors as the project progresses.

This includes safety management roles, where those who may have regularly been on-site now rarely visit the site. The result is that there is a reduction in focus on general safety on site, resulting in reduced compliance. Additionally, an implication of COVID-19 is that there have been fewer competent people on site, either through illness or due to efforts to limit the numbers of people for reasons of social distancing. The implication is that, with fewer competent people, staff have to resort to workarounds and less safe practices. For example, with fewer people on site with competencies for using plant to move materials and tools, workers may resort to manual lifting and carrying, and pressure remaining to work more quickly for those operating the plant.",

Safer behaviors may be developed by new prescribed practices by safety managers or supervisors, but COVID-19 has also generated some ad hoc behaviors that are developed by the workforce. In a recent observation as an example, placing steelwork columns (e.g., for steel frames or for rail overhead line masts) onto bolts is usually a task where people can expose themselves to finger and hand entrapment by moving too close when positioning the steel. Instead, workers have taken to using metal rods to push the steels into place to maintain social distancing, but also reducing the overall safety risk of entrapment. There is the opportunity to observe and learn from these ad hoc workarounds and implement them in more routine practice. This requires extra time and resources, and in practice people may try to work round each other in an unplanned, and often risky, manner.",

            "text": "Supporting COVID-19 working in construction also requires answers to a number of research questions. The first of these is to understand what truly is the epidemiological impact of COVID-19 on construction. While initially this was seen as a sector of risk, it is unclear whether the early indications of infections were due to a faster return to work in comparison to other sectors or some specific factor of construction work, or its demographic. Also, and possibly more relevant to those in human factors and ergonomics, is whether there was an overall decline or improvement in site safety, and in which categories of incidents or accidents changes occurred. This could be modeled using resilience frameworks (Pe\u00f1aloza et al., 2020; Wilson et al., 2009) Acknowledging the limitations of this article (U.K.-based construction, medium scale projects, informal observation rather than empirical data and analysis), work should look at the multitude of different construction projects. This needs to cover the very small (e.g., domestic construction) through to the very large (projects like High Speed 2), and those with a high priority and value (e.g., rail electrification [DfT, 2020] ). It should also cover specialist types of work, such as working in tunnels, underground, or other enclosed spaces, that might put particular pressures on adhering to guidance.",

On the other hand, smaller pieces of equipment (e.g., shovels) are usually taken from communal stores on an ad hoc basis without specific controls. These communal stores may not have a \"stores person\" to manage the tool cleaning, and so forth, and thus new COVID-19 controls are more difficult to apply. Making arrangements for secure storage of such tools on site can increase contamination risk.The example of using a stores person to manage communal tools highlights the choice between collective versus individual controls. While collective measures are higher up the control hierarchy, they often require extra resources (in cost, an extra person on site, management time, and surveillance). Individual control measures have greater reliance on individual compliance to COVID-19 controls, as there is less reliance on organizational safety management",

There is a reliance on face to face briefings to deliver key safety information, and these are increasingly conducted outside, taking account of social distancing restrictions. Whilst the weather has on the whole been accommodating over summer months, how to carry out briefings externally as COVID-19 continues into the winter months may need further consideration. Before COVID-19 formal engagement with the frontline was often in meetings (safety committees or safety action groups) or through on-site leadership tours. This has changed, particularly on larger projects, due to often limited internal space to accommodate face to face sessions whilst meeting social distancing requirements. With fewer non-essential site visits being undertaken from those not permanently site based (to reduce risk of transmission and exposure) there have been fewer leadership tours undertaken. This form of engagement generally takes place in less confined areas with general dilution ventilation, and so does provide a means of continued leader and workforce engagement.Since the start of the pandemic, there has been an increased use of technology to facilitate communication and engagement. Whether these are replacing traditional face to face meetings now hosted via an online system, or through increased use of social media channels set up within projects to communicate more effectively, and remotely, for example, whatsapp groups. Another potential use of technology is QR Codes to track individual briefing records within a project. Up to this",
