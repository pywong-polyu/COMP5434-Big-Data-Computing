            "text": "Combined stress has been seen as a major threat to world agriculture production. Maize is one of the leading cereal crops of the world due to its wide spectrum of growth conditions and is moderately sensitive to salt stress. A saline soil environment is a major factor that hinders its growth and overall yield and causes an increase in the concentration of micronutrients like boron, leading to excess over the requirement of the plant. Boron toxicity combined with salinity has been reported to be a serious threat to the yield and quality of maize. The response signatures of the maize plants to the combined effect of salinity and boron stress have not been studied well. We carried out an integrative systems-level analysis of the publicly available transcriptomic data generated on tolerant maize (Llute\u00f1o maize from the Atacama Desert, Chile) landrace under combined salt and boron stress. We identified significant biological processes that are differentially regulated in combined salt and boron stress in the leaves and roots of maize, respectively. Protein-protein interaction network analysis identified important roles of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), galactinol synthase 2 (GOLS2) proteins of leaf and proteolipid membrane potential regulator (pmpm4), metallothionein lea protein group 3 (mlg3), and cold regulated 410 (COR410) proteins of root in salt tolerance and regulating boron toxicity in maize. Identification of transcription factors coupled with regulatory network analysis using machine learning approach identified a few heat shock factors (HSFs) and NAC (NAM (no apical meristem, Petunia), ATAF1-2 (Arabidopsis thaliana activating factor), and CUC2 (cup-shaped cotyledon, Arabidopsis)) family transcription factors (TFs) to play crucial roles in salt tolerance, maintaining reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and minimizing oxidative damage to the cells. These findings will provide new ways to design targeted functional validation experiments for developing multistress-resistant maize crops.",

India is ranked 101 st among the 126 countries with a global hunger index (GHI) score of 27.5 which falls under the \"serious\" category, making it a topic of immediate concern [2] . Global food security has become a serious concern, with the periodic climate change which comes with direct and indirect adverse effects through temperature rise, rainfall, reduction of groundwater levels, soil erosion, flooding, etc. on agricultural production of important crops like rice, wheat, maize, barley, and soybean [3] . This change in climate also helps to increase the incidence of diseases and pests making the agricultural plants vulnerable to them [4] . Being sessile and grown under a direct environment, plants are constantly exposed to different types of severe environmental stresses, i.e., abiotic that are governed by non-living factors like soil salinity, temperature, water, and biotic, governed by living pathogens [5] .",

            "text": "Salinity stress is one of the most common stress conditions which affects about 20-50% of irrigated lands worldwide and causes an annual economic loss of up to 12.6 billion dollars [6] . Salinity stress is generally governed by water-soluble salts present in the soil that affect the plant by causing reduction of water and osmotic potential, chlorophyll, etc. leading to death [7] . Reports say that more than 800 million hectares of land have been affected by salinity, and some of them have been rendered completely unusable for agriculture [8] . Roots being the only route for mineral transport to the plants, ions generated from salt enter the plant body via transporters, with their excess transport leading to internal damages to the plant [9] . Boron is an important micronutrient for plants. Deficiency as well as excess amounts of boron acts as two different stress conditions that hamper plant growth and development and restrict crop production worldwide [10] . Different regions around the globe like California, India, Chile, Peru, Malaysia, the Middle East, and some parts of Australia contain an adequately high amount of boron in the soil restricting agricultural production in these areas. Plants, in fact, experience combined stress in the natural environment and respond accordingly, which is quite different from the response to single stress conditions. In the natural environment, soil salinity is considered to be a companion of boron, as it is accumulated as sodium salts in high saline areas due to its soluble nature. This combination of boron and salinity stress is called \"BorSal.\" BorSal can occur naturally through high boron and saline soil or irrigation with high salt and boron containing water [5, 6, 11, 12] .",

It has proved to be the most versatile cereal crop due to its adaptability in various climatic zones and 83% of its production being used in feed, starch, and biofuel industries. Despite its range of adaptability, maize cultivation in the world is limited by diseases and abiotic stress factors leading to a grain loss of about 11% of the total production. As maize is a moderately salt-sensitive crop, salinity stress considerably affects its growth and development and thereby reduces overall yield, which is a matter of immediate concern.",

            "text": "Since the past decade, along with experimental analysis, scientists have been using high-throughput omic approaches to understand the systemic complexity and gain mechanistic insights of plants during stress conditions [13] . The transcriptomic approach for studying the expression and regulation of coding regions of the plant genome in response to different stress conditions has aided in capturing significant information on stress resistance genes and transcription factors [14, 15] . Transcriptomic study of maize during single heat stress has identified 167 putative transcription factors belonging to different TF families like myeloblastosis (MYB), apetala2-ethylene responsive element binding protein (AP2-EREBP), basic leucine zipper (b-ZIP), basic helix loop helix (bHLH), NAC, and WRKY (a TF family renamed with singlet codes of tryptophan, arginine, lysine, and tyrosine) [16] . Maize seeds treated with zinc are reported to improve tolerance against boron toxicity by activating genes related to carbon metabolism, hormone signal transduction, ribosome assembly, etc. [17] . Similarly, the application of salicylic acid improved ROS scavenging systems in the plant during boron stress [18] . Li et al. [19] performed a global transcriptome analysis of maize during individual drought, salinity, heat, and cold stress and reported 167 commonly regulated genes with 10 upregulated and 2 downregulated TFs, respectively. The majority of these analyses reported results targeting a single stress response. A limited number of transcriptomic studies have been conducted in maize against combined stress response, namely, drought and cold stress [20] , cold and heat stress [21] , and cold and drought stress [22] . The study conducted by Huanca-Mamani et al. [23] , on combined salinity and boron stress in maize, focused on their effect in the noncoding regions of maize. Hence, we performed an integrative systems-level transcriptomic data analysis using the publicly available maize dataset to identify the differentially expressed genes along with the common and unique molecular signatures expressed during stress resistance in leaves and roots.",

The fastq files followed alignment using Hisat2 against the Zm-B73-REF-ERENCE-GRAMENE-4.0 maize plant reference genome [26] resulting in large sam files. These sam files were then compressed into bam files, and they were subjected to read mapping at the gene level using the featureCounts tool [27] and taking Zea_mays.B73_RefGen_v4.49 as the annotation file (gtf). The count data obtained were subjected to differential expression analysis using the DESeq2 R package [28] for the identification of differentially expressed genes Table S1 ). Taking p adj \u2264 0:05, the list of DEGs was created for two datasets ( Figure 2 ). The VennDiagram tool (https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/ webtools/Venn/) was used to check for common and unique DEGs in leaf and root (Figure 3(a) ). Hierarchical clustering of the overlapping DEGs was done using MeV (version 4.9.0) [29] to observe their expression in leaf and root, respectively (Figure 3 (b)). The data was then followed for downstream analysis.",

The gradient gradually progressed towards leaves that responded to abiotic and chemical stimuli such as osmotic stress, water deprivation, chemical, inorganic substance, and alcohol (Figure 4(b) ). This suggested that a major portion of stress tolerance in maize got built up in the root system and progressed towards the shoot system. By comparing the top five GO terms enriched in leaf and root for all three-time points, it was observed that salinity and boron stress were triggered in both leaves and roots for basic metabolic responses.

Proteins related to hormone transport [57] and biosynthesis are expressed along with guard proteins like nucleoredoxin which protects antioxidant enzymes from ROS-mediated oxidation [58] . Two putative genes (Zm00001d038181 and Zm00001d044529) coded for the hormone transporter protein family nitrate transporter 1/peptide transporter (NRT1/ PTR) which plays an important role in the transport of hormones like IAA (indole-3-acetic acid/auxin), GA, JA, and ABA [59] . Genes that coded for hormones were found to express in both leaves and roots, resulting in the coordinated regulation of combined stress. Apart from this, we also observed 8 proteins, which are not yet characterized and have been grouped as unknown (Supplementary Table S2 ). From the above analysis, it can be inferred that the plant tries to establish complete coordination between root and leaf by activating proteins in both the stress-affected regions.",

As observed from the PPI network analysis, the hub genes identified from leaves are mainly involved in growth and development, regulation of cellular ROS levels coupled with heat shock absorption activity. The genes pro1 and glo1 were reported to play a key role in photorespiratory metabolism which catalyzes the oxidation of glycolate to acetaldehyde and produces H 2 O 2 (hydrogen peroxide) ( Figure 5(a) ). The photorespiration process is significant in maize despite it being a C4 plant because of the evolution of this pathway, preventing toxic glycolate accumulation. Hence, C4 photosynthesis in maize is photorespiration-dependent throughout seedling development [60] . The function of P5CS was reported in embryogenesis, pollen development, fertility, and reproductive development [61] . Its involvement in proline biosynthesis made it the rate-limiting enzyme and is subjected to feedback inhibition by proline which in turn regulates proline levels under normal as well as in stress conditions [62] . Reports have also shown that proline accumulation increases during salinity stress making it a compatible osmolyte for osmotic adjustment. This phenomenon also results in the stabilization of proteins, membranes, and subcellular structures, buffering of cellular redox potential and protection of cellular functions by ROS [63] . The aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) enzyme is reported to be involved in proline homeostasis and indirectly detoxify cellular levels of ROS [64] , aids in another development by acting as a nuclear restorer of cytoplasmic male sterility [65] . This enzyme also aids in reducing the effect of cellular toxicity as a result of lipid peroxidation during drought and salt stress [66] .",

The pmpm4, as its name suggests, is involved in cation uptake that regulates the membrane potential of root cells thereby maintaining intracellular ion homeostasis during salt stress [67] . The BMY1 and mlg3 genes function as key regulators of growth and development [68, 69] . While BMY1 aids in the process of seed germination and maintaining the physiological quality of seeds [70] , mlg3 forms polypeptides that accumulate in the plant tissues as well as in maturing embryos experiencing water deficit. This accumulation of polypeptide is dependent on abscisic acid and limitation of water uptake and helps in protection against osmotic shrinkage during stress [71] . The overexpression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) during combined salinity and boron stress gave an indication of the resistant parameters that are induced/coexpressed to confer higher tolerance. HSP101 is required in the translational enhancement of mRNA [72] , for heat-induced thermotolerance [73] and maintenance of a high basal thermotolerant state in the germinating kernels [74] . HSP70 of the HSP family is involved in regulating cellular ROS levels by maintaining antioxidant enzymes and their activities, resulting in a significant increase in stress tolerance and cryoprotection [75] . It also functions as a chaperone by stabilizing new proteins and ensuring their correct folding or by aiding in the refolding of proteins that were damaged by cell stress [76] . COR410 belongs to group II late embryogenesis abundant (LEA) proteins, also called dehydrins. Dehydrins are the low molecular weight proteins that take part in protective reactions to dehydration in plants [77] . They have been reported to bind to metal ions that can inhibit the production of ROS at its source [78] . They can also bind to DNA as well as proteins and membranes; this would ultimately protect the structural integrity of DNA and the proteins from damage by environmental stress [69] .",

The transcription factors belonging to the families NAC, HSF, bHLH, HD-ZIP, and MYB are expressed in both leaves and roots due to their involvement in transcription regulation, DNA binding, regulation of ABA signaling, and cell growth. The NAC family is reported to be one of the largest plant-specific transcription factor families that function as positive or negative regulators of plant immunity to biotic stress and as modulators of abiotic stress responses [83] . It has been reported that NAC44 helps in plant secondary wall formation and in enhancing salt tolerance [84] proving its expression to be of spatial importance against salinity stress response. The HSFs are an important group of stress-responsive TFs identified in a large number of plant species that function in transcriptional regulation during abiotic stress. They have been reported to activate several target genes in response to environmental stresses of high temperature, heavy metals, oxidants, and drought [85] . The bHLH transcription factor in plants also comprises one of the largest TF families for their regulation in several abiotic stresses. They regulate their transcriptional expression by specifically binding to the cis-elements in the promoter region of the target genes involved in stress response. They also aid in regulating the synthesis of flavonoids that in turn, aid in the maintenance of ROS homeostasis during abiotic stress [86] . HD-ZIP, commonly referred to as homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factors, enhanced tolerance to drought and salt stress and increased sensitivity to abscisic acid [87] . It acts as a positive transcriptional regulator against drought and salt tolerance in plants through an ABA-dependent signaling pathway. The MYB transcription factors are found to be widely distributed in plants, mainly for their involvement in ABA response [88] and the phenylpropanoid metabolism pathway. They are directly linked to the control of the cell cycle in plants, thereby promoting maintenance during stress conditions [89] . The transcription factors unique to leaf and roots have shown to be responsive towards different modes of abiotic stresses (Table 1) . 4.6. Dynamics of Gene Regulatory Network Topology. The hub TFs identified from the regulatory network analysis of leaves were dbf1, hb41, mybr24, HSF1, and HSF8, and that of roots were NAC44, HSF17, and hb41, respectively.",

MYB TFs are reported to be involved in the negative regulation of salt-sensitive overlay (SOS) protein which is a sodium/potassium transporter [110] and activation of the ABA signaling pathway [111] conferring stress tolerance. HSF1 and HSF8 of the HSF family are known for epigenetic regulation by binding to a number of genes such as APX2 (ascorbate peroxidase), HSPs, heat stress-associated 32-kD protein (Hsa32), FK506-binding proteins (ROF1), and drought-regulated gene 29A (RD29A) which coordinately help the plant in stress adaptation [112] . NAC44, a part of the NAC TF family (NAM, ATAF1, 2, and CUC2), is involved in drought and salt tolerance, growth, and development [113, 117] by regulating defense responsive genes like late embryogenesis abundant (LEA), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and glyoxalase.",

Our observations have also predicted the possible activation of a signal crosstalk mechanism between the leaves and roots with an overlapping expression of genes and transcription factors regulating defense response, hormonal response, and cellular processes. Further study on the significant hub genes and transcription factors would help understand the mechanistic insights of their working and to develop multistress-resistant varieties of maize.",
