            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) is an infectious disease caused by coronavirus. Most people infected with COVID-19 develop mild to moderate respiratory problems. The virus mainly spread through saliva droplets or nasal discharge when an infected person sneezes or coughs (11, 12) . COVID-19 is the most crucial issue we face now, and it has had a significant impact on our lifestyle (13) . However, children generally suffer from a milder form of the illness (14) . The COVID-19 pandemic has touched all parts of society. People with mental disabilities are particularly vulnerable to the physical, psychological, and social effects of this pandemic (15) . COVID-19 can also affect ASD patients; the impact of this pandemic on this group will be more significant than ordinary people (16, 17) . Children and adolescents with ASD are more susceptible to the disturbing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and quarantine on their mental health (18) . Many governments have now taken more restrictive measures to prevent the spread of the disease. One of these measures is staying at home for parents and children. In this situation, caring for little children with ASD can be upsetting for families and caregivers (19) . The coronavirus pandemic is changing the function of society. Environmental changes, disruption of daily activities, and lower access to services and social networks will profoundly affect ASD patients and their families, and sometimes it will devastate them (20) . These children usually receive therapeutic interventions a few hours a week at home, hospitals, or private institutions with special therapists. But at present, children with ASD should not be engaged in interventions to maintain their health, prevent more parental stress and aggravation of children's behavioral problems (19) . Depression, trying to cope with change, and having difficulty interacting with others are some of the challenges ASD patients deal with most of the time. However, amidst a pandemic, these challenges are exacerbated (21) . COVID-19 increases anxiety and distress in ASD patients. Adaptation to increased health recommendations and observance, social isolation, and social distance has changed the usual lifestyle of people with ASD and upset them (22) . Overall, 20% of ASD patients are diagnosed with anxiety, and 11% suffer from depressive disorders (23) . The further distress caused by the coronavirus pandemic means that ASD patients with a cognitive disturbance may experience worsening their mental health. Even those ASD patients, who did not have mental health problems, were at higher risk for developing them, especially anxiety (24) and depression (25) . Also, uncertainty about COVID-19 and the constant flow of new information can affect ASD patients and increase their anxiety and distress (23) . The coronavirus, combined with its high rates of infection and mortality, has created global psychosocial effects. The widespread fear of COVID-19, the so-called corona phobia, has led to many psychiatric manifestations in various social groups (26) . It is necessary to conduct a study to determine and collect the various psychosocial consequences of COVID-19 for people with ASD due to the high prevalence and many problems compared to other people in the community and even people with other disabilities. These consequences need to be investigated in order to help improve the psychosocial condition of these people by eliminating the unfavorable psychological and social conditions that have doubly affected the lives of these people and their families. This research provided evidence for policymakers, NGO planners, individuals with ASD and their families, as well as psychological and counseling service providers to develop evidence-based protocols and interventions for this group to improve their mental health and social status in the situation of COVID-19 epidemic and even after the end of this condition.",

One in three empirical studies discussed the psychological distress, health challenges, and mental health in caregivers and families during the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 is questioning the routine of our young children with ASD, and they are called to respect rules and habits that are not always understandable for them (i.e., disinfect your hands, do not touch your eyes or nose, and cover your mouth. They are also not able to see people they would like to meet and must stay at home). These changed routines could cause profound suffering for them.

(19) Results of the study revealed that the impact of health anxiety on the psychological wellbeing levels among mothers with autistic children are more substantial than it was among mothers with normal children. It was found that mothers with autistic children, compared to mothers with typical children tended to have a higher level of health anxiety about chronic diseases and were inclined to have a lower level of dispositional hope and psychological wellbeing. The current crisis has created an unprecedented demand for parent support. Still, it has also forced us to curtail in-person services and, instead, interact via phone and the Internet media. With simple exercises based on known principles, strategies, and kernels, behavior analysts connecting with parents online may promote positive parenting to the extent that had never happened before. We have focused on the ways to promote prosocial conduct at home by pointing out that these actions are reflections of superpowers possessed by children. But it is equally valid that parents, navigating an unprecedented situation with no lead time, are the unsung heroes of this era. At present, the COCID-19 emergency is still representing a massive psychological overload for all individuals. Additionally, returning to the same level of activity as before the COVID-19 pandemic may not be easy. Our retrospective study did not show a significant change in our individuals' problematic behaviors with ASD after initiation of COVID-19 restrictions. We could cautiously hypothesize that the preventive countermeasures we adopted effectively reduced distress in individuals with ASD. An online survey (with the online questionnaire)",

Establishing new routines for ASD patients may create challenging behavior and resistance and increase caregivers' stress, especially if administered suddenly and without warning (23) . COVID-19 pandemic affects all parts of society. People with mental disabilities are especially vulnerable to the physical, psychological, and social effects of the pandemic (15) . Excessive stress may worsen caregivers' mental health; as this burden increases, higher rates of depression and anxiety are reported by the patients. These conditions affect their daily functioning and prevent them from providing optimal care (42) . Therefore, policymakers must recognize this group's complex needs and the psychological damages they encounter. Particular attention should be paid to this group of people, and efforts should be made to minimize and alleviate their discomfort (21) . To better deal with this type of psychosocial problem of different groups of society, the government, health care personnel, and other stakeholders should develop proper models of intervention and prevention of psychosocial crises (26) . The aim of this study was to investigate the psychological and social consequences of COVID-19 on ASD patients and their families. The evaluation of the published articles showed significant points. Nistic\u00f2 et al. (2020) noted that people with a highfunctioning ASD in the first two months of the COVID-19 pandemic suffer more from depression, anxiety, stress, and the symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) compared to the healthy control group (27) . The study results by Rodriguez showed that the mental health of the children with ASD changes in crises such as this pandemic. Violence, sleep disorders, irritability, screaming, and stereotyped behaviors were the most common changes (28) . In the Asbury et al. study, many families reported that COVID-19 impacted their mental health and often led to an increase in their fear and anxiety, and a few families reported increased anxiety, low mood, and stress (29) . In the Bent study, parents with autistic children expressed their experiences with social skills, e-learning, transfer, structure, difficulty and the stress associated with COVID-19 during the COVID-19 pandemic (30) . The Colizzi study also showed that most parents of ASD patients found the period of change, and the restrictions followed the onset of emergencies so challenging that they needed more commitment than before. Behavioral problems worsened in more than one-third of ASD patients (31) . Lee et al. (2020) showed an increase in social disorders such as loss of a job, increased marital conflict, and financial instability. These increasing behavioral challenges lead to problems in parent-child interactions and stress in family relationships. Some other papers in this study also indicated that parents have experienced increased anxiety and stress and needed more support (32) . Cassidy and Nicolaidis (2020) revealed the points and challenges considered for all people, especially adults with ASD. Some of them included dealing with uncertain-ty, changing daily routines, amassed social isolation, increased vulnerabilities, more financial and job instability; increased mental health problems, including anxiety, and challenges in managing concurrent physical health issues, increasing need for formal and informal supports and concerns about health care resources (17) . Narzisi study showed that COVID-19 disrupted the routines of little children with ASD, and they were asked to respect the rules and customs which were never understandable by them (9) . In Stankovich et al. study, parents of autistic children raised their concerns about pandemics and emergencies. The main challenges were related to the child's behavior and the problems that parents encountered in receiving the necessary services and support for these children (36) . The results of the Szabo et al. study showed that the current crisis had created an unprecedented demand for parental support (37) . Brondino et al. also found that the loss of specific long-term interventions in this group might lead to a loss of skills, decreased positive behaviors, and an increase in incompatible behaviors (38) . The Jeste et al. study results showed that telemedicine and tele-rehabilitation are available during the COVID-19 restriction period. Also, it may provide opportunities for sustainable care and education once these restrictions are waived (39) . The results of the Manning et al. study showed that during the COVID-19 crisis, ASD patients and their families report high levels of stress and disturbance in life. Most of the stress areas were related to isolation, illness, and financial problems (40) .",
