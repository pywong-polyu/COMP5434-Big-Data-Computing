            "text": "Healthcare systems worldwide are currently facing major challenges due to the global spread of coronavirus . It is expected that the pandemic may hit in several waves in the coming year and healthcare systems have to be prepared for these waves. 1 On February 27, 2020, the first COVID-19 case was confirmed at a regional acute University hospital in Denmark. This resulted in an immediate organizational response coordinated according to the national and WHO 4-phase pandemics strategy. 2 This included an emergency leadership committee that was in full charge of coordination and modification of the infrastructure at the hospital on a daily basis. Two COVID-19 units and a test center were established, resulting in re-organizing and moving units and staff, as well as recruiting and training staff in intensive care. Frontline leaders across the hospital had to face major challenges in order to postpone all non-acute operations, secure patients the best possible care and treatment, and to ensure a safe environment because a focus on employees during a pandemic is crucial. 3 Healthcare leaders are familiar with continuous change and developments, but the COVID-19 situation has forced leaders to face challenges many have never experienced before. [4] [5] [6] There is still a lack of leadership literature regarding healthcare leaders experiences in the present situation, but learning from the SARS pandemic highlights that when no standard procedures exists, effective leadership is key to successful crisis management and vital for staff commitment to their professional responsibilities. [7] [8] [9] This includes, but is not limited to, effective communication, coordination and decision-making, collaboration, and collective behavior. 10, 11 Leadership under such circumstances is difficult and may lead to feelings of role overload, conflict or ambiguity if the leader's values and beliefs are compromised. 12 However, leaders may also gain unintended positive experiences and acquire leadership competencies that could not have been gained elsewhere, for instance those regarding virtual leadership. 12, 13 Purpose This study aims to identify the differences in experiences of leaders in the beginning of the coronavirus (COVID- 19) pandemic and to generate knowledge for future leadership during and post crises.",

In the process, the questionnaire was reduced to the final 27 items that were found adequate to represent the construct. 24 The items focused on four overall themesconcerns (including values and beliefs), coordination and decision-making, collaboration (internal and external) and communication. 10, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Subsequently, an expert panel consisting of two nurse leaders and a medical doctor assessed the content validity and evaluated the clarity of the questions, including identification of any gaps and that the questions addressed the four themes. 24 Face validity of the questionnaire was achieved by pilot-testing the survey with a group of four healthcare leaders and subsequently the wording of four questions were adjusted. The survey was developed in Danish and then translated for academic purposes by a native Englishspeaking senior researcher.",

In a study of Taiwanese nurse leaders during the SARS epidemic, significant support from other leaders was found to be an important factor in ensuring quality of care. 7 Therefore, our study indicates that interpersonal actions among ward managers and their nearest leaders, and among the heads of departments and hospital leaders were experienced as less supportive and compassionate. 31 This is a worrying finding and it further highlights the need for consistency in leadership behaviors and practices at all levels. In that context, the importance of \"shared values\" among leaders at all levels of an organization has been previously highlighted. 32, 33 The existence of such shared values provides a benchmark for leadership practices across an organization and at all levels.",

Interestingly, despite their tasks seeming meaningful to them, the leaders who had a leadership education felt more overloaded and were more concerned about the health and wellbeing of patients, staff, own and own family's health. This is an interesting finding, as it highlights the role that leadership education plays in helping leaders to balance task assignment/achievement with the wellbeing of persons. In particular, this finding opens a space for exploring the place of person-centred leadership in times of crisis. 28 At such times, task achievement inevitably becomes the key priority. However, the welfare and well-being of persons who are affected by such crises is of equal concern, but is often relegated to a lower level Journal of Healthcare Leadership 2021:13 submit your manuscript | www.dovepress.com DovePress of priority. Person-centred educated leaders have the expertise to integrate these concerns, recognizing that the well-being of all persons is a key strategy in effective task achievement and leadership effectiveness. 28, 35 Regarding coordination and decision-making, significantly more leaders with formal management education experienced that they had the necessary management competences to handle the situation compared with the leaders who did not have formal education. Despite evidence of the value of management education, some health professionals are still promoted to leadership positions on the basis of their clinical expertise without having the specific management competence. 36, 37 The results of our research is an important message to hospital leaders, to prioritize raising the education level of existing leaders, as well as setting a requirement for a higher level of educational preparation in the appointment of future leaders.",
