A stochastic agent-based model of COVID-19 intracellular dynamics is introduced here, that incorporates essential steps of the viral life cycle targeted by treatment options. Integration of model predictions with an intercellular ODE model of within-host infection dynamics, fitted to patient data, generates a generic profile of disease progression in patients that have recovered in the absence of treatment. This is contrasted with the profiles obtained after variation of model parameters pertinent to the immune response, such as effector cell and antibody proliferation rates, mimicking disease progression in immunocompromised patients. These profiles are then compared with disease progression in the presence of antiviral and convalescent plasma therapy against COVID-19 infections. The model reveals that using both therapies in combination can be very effective in reducing the length of infection, but these synergistic effects decline with a delayed treatment start. Conversely, early treatment with either therapy alone can actually increase the duration of infection, with infectious virions still present after the decline of other markers of infection. This suggests that usage of these treatments should remain carefully controlled in a clinical environment. as the nucleocapsid (N) protein (figure 1a). N protein forms a complex with the genomic RNA (gRNA), and thus aids its compaction for ease of packaging within the viral envelope. The S protein binds the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor on human cells and is therefore essential for cell entry. The model also includes non-structural proteins that are important for the viral life cycle, such as the replicase-transcriptase complex (RTC), and keeps track of the numbers of gRNAs (and subgenomic sgRNAs) at different stages of the replication process. These include both the original plussense template of the RNA molecules, as well as their negative-sense variants that arise transiently during transcription. There are nine negative-sense sub-genomic RNAs (-sgRNAs), corresponding to different gene products. In particular, there is an individual one for each of the structural proteins, allowing the virus to produce these components in the different quantities required for formation of viral particles [16] .",

(-)sgRNAs are produced through discontinuous transcription [19] , where elongation of nascent (-)RNA continues until the first functional transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) is encountered. A fixed proportion of RTCs will disregard the TRS motif and continue to elongate the nascent strand, while the remainder will halt synthesis of the nascent minus strand and instead synthesize (-)sgRNAs [20] . The nine TRS motifs in the SARS-CoV-2 genome correspond to the nine sgRNAs produced, hence the choice to elongate or terminate synthesis occurs up to nine times during the elongation process [21] . The (-)RNA and (-)sgRNAs produce positive-sense RNAs by recruiting RTC. The sgRNAs are translated to form proteins using cellular ribosomes. In the final step, a gRNA and the structural proteins (S, M, N and E) form a new virion according to an assembly reaction that takes the stoichiometry of the different viral components into account [16] , and the virus particle is then released from the host cell.",

            "text": "We note, however, that the length of the time lag, and correspondingly the total number of virions released, are affected by some of these parameters and therefore warrant a more detailed investigation. For example, increasing the ribosomal protein production rate (electronic supplementary material, figure S3a) or the RTC nucleotide association rate (electronic supplementary material, figure S3b) decreases the time lag and therefore increases the number of virions released. By contrast, variation of the half-life of RTC or the formation rate of RTC from the constituent proteins does not have a significant effect on the time lag (electronic supplementary material, figure S3c and d). Figure 1b shows the time lag to the release of the first virion from an infected cell as a function of the ribosomal frameshifting probability q and of the RTC elongation probability r. Figure 1b indicates that decreasing r results in a rapid increase in the time lag: for example, when r = 0.55 and the virus produces many sub-genomic fragments, this time lag is longer than 200 h. This implies that viral load is maximized for the scenario that the RTC favours continuation of the transcription process when encountering a TRS. Given the importance of frameshifting in the coronavirus life cycle to control the relative numbers of different viral components, it has been argued that the virus will have evolved to optimize this ratio. In particular, frameshift signals have been characterized experimentally previously to have efficiencies in the range of 20-45% [27] [28] [29] [30] , although a recent study has suggested that the frameshift rate may be slightly higher [31] . Our model identifies an optimal value of 0.3 < q < 0.5 as the range with the lowest time lag and hence maximal virion release (figure 1b), in good agreement with the experimentally determined range of 20-45%.",

Remdesivir, originally developed as a treatment for hepatitis C virus and later trialled for efficacy against Ebola, acts as a nucleoside analogue that mimics adenosine nucleotide [32] . During the replication process, RTC may insert remdesivir molecules instead of adenosine, resulting in capping of the strand and thus terminating replication [25] . We have included additional reactions into the model that describe remdesivir binding to the RTC complexes on the gRNAs and sgRNAs to capture this (see electronic supplementary material for details), and track the effect of a given, fixed number of remdesivir molecules per cell on the release of viral particles from an infected host cell. Figure 1c ,d shows the impact on viral load released from a single-infected cell for two different concentrations of remdesivir, as well as treatment starts at different times post infection (TPIs). In figure  1c , a free concentration equivalent to 25 remdesivir molecules per cell is considered, corresponding to a concentration of approximately 0.06 \u03bcM (see electronic supplementary material) [26] .

Magenta (long-dashed), green (dotted), red (dashed-dotted) and orange (dashed) curves show the impact(s) of treatment start at TPIs of 50, 30, 20 and 10 h, respectively. Figure 1c demonstrates that starting treatment during the latent period reduces the total number of virions released significantly. Even given a later treatment start the rate of virion production is slowed down, but the earlier treatment is started, the stronger the reduction in the virion production rate. Our results are consistent with experiments that probed the impact of remdesivir on mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infection [33] , which also revealed that starting treatment earlier and during the latent period is more effective, as is the case also in other betacoronaviruses. Figure 1d shows the impact of doubling the drug concentration (equivalent to a concentration of 50 molecules of remdesivir per cell). In this case, starting treatment early during infection at 20 h post infection reduced the number of virions released on average by more than half. However, starting treatment later in the infection, such as 30 or 50 h post infection, decreases the number of released virions by a smaller fraction. This suggests that although an increased drug concentration can be beneficial, starting the treatment earlier is more effective at reducing viral load than an increase in dosage.",

Uninfected cells are infected by free virions at rate \u03b2.

Antibodies are produced at rate p A proportional to the viral load and are degraded at rate d A . After viral clearance, the antibody level is kept at a homeostatic level, because of the long-lived plasma and memory B cells. To represent this, we add a logistic term with proliferation rate r A and carrying capacity A m to the antibody equation. A fixed basal level of effector cells is assumed (\u03bb E /d E ), and upon infection the population of effector cells will expand at rate \u03b1(L + I)E [37] [38] [39] . Both L and I have an impact on the immune response, because infected cells during the latent phase are producing viral proteins. Although infected cells at different stages of infection are likely to express slightly different levels of viral peptide-MHC (major histocompatibility complex) on their surface, we assumed that the rates are the same for L and I in order to minimize the number of free parameters in our model. royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R.

As \u03bb E /d E is the basal level of effector cells, it is assumed to be constant for each patient [37] . Thus, \u03b1 and \u03bc are parameters that are probably varying in different patients. In particular, they would be expected to be lower in immunocompromised patients than for a patient with a healthy immune system [37, 39, 43, 44] . Figure 3d (red curve; see also electronic supplementary material, figure S5 ) demonstrates that although reduction in the value of \u03bc can increase the damage to healthy cells (T) slightly, this effect is much stronger when reducing \u03b1 (figure 3g, blue curves). Even though decreasing either of these parameters causes a slower decline in viral load after the second peak ( figure 3e,h) , a smaller value of \u03b1 in addition increases the maximum of both peaks. Figure 3j ,k,l (magenta curves in electronic supplementary material, figure S5) model the case where just the humoral immune response is weakened, i.e. where the proliferation rate of antibodies r A is reduced [42] . In this case, viral load shows three peaks, and the damage to healthy cells recovers only slowly. This demonstrates that each component of the immune response plays a different, and crucial role in the recovery process.

This means that infected cells in the latent phase (L) do not transition to phase I, and begin shedding virions at a reduced rate (following a time lag \u03c4) compared with cells that were already in phase I at the onset of treatment. However, as our numerical results show that the delayed model (electronic supplementary material, figure S6 ) has the same behaviour as the model without a time delay, i.e. \u03c4 = 0, (figure 3), we set \u03c4 = 0.

Cells in phase L produce virions at the reduced rate of p(1 \u2212 e). Our intracellular model (figure 1c,d) suggests that starting therapy during the latent period can reduce the level of virions released by approximately 99% on average. We thus assume e = 0.99 for the efficacy of remdesivir in cells in phase L. This is a good approximation, as all values of e calculated from figure 1c are above 98%, regardless of treatment start time. Cells that were already in the productively infectious phase (I) at the time of treatment start are assumed to produce virions at rate p(1 \u2212 \u03b7), where \u03b7 \u2264 e is the efficacy of remdesivir in these cells. Figure 1c indicates that starting therapy during the productively infectious period can reduce the level of released virions by approximately 90% on average. Therefore, we set \u03b7 = 0.9. We note that these values of e and \u03b7 are consistent with values used in previous models [6, 7, 21] . Figure 3a -c illustrates the impact of treatment on viral clearance in a patient who would most likely recover without treatment, as the parameters have been chosen as the median values of the 12 patients who have recovered from COVID-19 without treatment (table 1). In this generic scenario, a treatment start 7 days post infection (dpi), which is approximately the time of the first peak in viral load, prevents the second peak from occurring (black dashed lines in figure 3 ). An earlier treatment start at 6 dpi also leads to the same result. However, starting treatment even earlier at 5 dpi (black dash-dot lines in figure 3 ) also reduces the damage to healthy cells. Even though free virus declines slower in this case, the area under the viral load curve (AUC), an infection-related quantity commonly used to help the assessment of a treatment against acute viral diseases [47] , is much smaller. In respiratory infections, even after viral clearance the immune response can cause respiratory and systemic symptoms in some incidences [47, 48] . A treatment start at 5 dpi results in a reduction in the peak of immune response cells, suggesting that early treatment perhaps could mitigate against this.",

Our model enables the impact of CP therapy on viral dynamics to be studied for different treatment starts and doses, thus addressing the bottle-neck pointed out in the recent literature of finding the optimal dose and start for CP treatment [5] . Using again median values from table 1 to generate a generic patient profile as a control, and using three immunocompromised cases that are presented in figure 3 (red, blue and magenta curves, representing cases with reduced values for the immune response parameters \u03bc, \u03b1 and r A , respectively) we studied the impact of CP therapy. Electronic supplementary material, figure S7 shows the minimum level of therapeutic antibodies\u00c3 m that is needed to reduce the AUC by 25% and 50% as a function of the start of treatment (in dpi) and the factor f by which therapeutic antibodies are less efficient than those produced by the host during the infection. It indicates that the level of\u00c3 m that is needed for an effective reduction in the AUC is at most around 3 \u00c2 10 11 molecules ml \u22121 . This is in good agreement with clinical data, reporting a 200 ml dose of CP and A m \u00bc 4 \u00c2 10 12 molecules ml \u22121 (see Methods) [5, 42, 49] . Indeed, this implies that each dose would contain about 8 \u00c2 10 14 molecules, resulting in\u00c3 m \u00bc 2:6 \u00c2 10 11 molecules ml \u22121 on the basis of an average level of 3 l blood in the body [50] . Hence, a reduction of the AUC by 50% is achievable. Electronic supplementary material, figure S7 also shows that AUC reduction is comparable in the range 0.7 \u2264 f \u2264 0.9, therefore, we use the average value of this range (f = 0.8) in our calculations. Our conclusions are robust for efficiencies greater than or equal to 0.15, while for values of f below 0.15 the outcomes vary for different immunocompromised cases. Using these parameters, we present a comparative analysis between antiviral and CP therapy and explore their synergistic potential. Figure 4 shows that similar to the case of antiviral therapy in figure 3 , an early treatment start is more effective in the reduction of tissue damage and the level of AUC compared with a later therapy start (cf. electronic supplementary material, figure S8 for the equivalent of figure 3 for CP therapy; cf. electronic supplementary material, table S3 for AUC values). While figure 3 reveals scenarios in which an antiviral therapy does not mitigate against tissue damage (such as a later treatment start at 6 or 7 dpi), figure 4 shows that using CP therapy can reduce tissue damage even for those delayed treatment starts. Interestingly, figure 4 shows that starting CP therapy early can increase the duration of infection more than for antiviral therapy, implying that for an early treatment start using remdesivir is more effective. By contrast, for later treatment starts CP therapy reduces the viral load faster and decreases tissue damage compared with remdesivir therapy. Our model also enables us to probe the synergies of these treatments options. Figure 4c ,f,i and l indicate that for an early treatment, combination therapy mitigates against a longer duration of the infection (cf. electronic supplementary material, table S4 for AUC values). However, for later treatment starts any synergistic effects are minimal and combination therapy has the same outcome as CP therapy in isolation. Thus, unless infection is detected early, e.g. though an efficient track and trace system, treatment would probably start at a time when CP therapy in isolation would be as effective as combination therapy. Figure 5 indicates the impact of starting treatments after the onset of symptoms, i.e. the day on which symptoms were first reported by the 12 patients in the study [3] used for model fitting. Both treatments reduced the duration of the infection significantly (in 67% of the patients), enabling a faster recovery, or otherwise have no significant impact on the duration of the infection. However, in some cases in which the peak in viral load and the AUC are significantly reduced (electronic supplementary material, table S5), the treatments have not decreased the duration of infection. This figure also shows that there are cases for which the duration of infection is not reduced by one treatment, but would be reduced by royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R. Soc. Open Sci. 8: 210082 combination therapy of both treatments. In the other cases, these treatment options have more or less similar effects, although CP therapy performs slightly better, and in these cases there is not a notable synergistic effect.",

Vaccination options against SARS-CoV-2 are actively pursued and a number of treatments are now in use in the clinics, but there are still many open questions regarding when and how best to administer these treatments, either in isolation or in combination. Whilst modelling of disease transmission has already played a key role in informing policy makers [51] , models of within-host dynamics have not yet had a prominent role in combating the disease. There is a precedence of intracellular modelling for other viral diseases, such as hepatitis C virus [2] . However, such models cannot be readily transferred to coronaviral infection, as viral life cycles are very different. Here we introduce a within-host model of a SARS-CoV-2 infection that contains sufficient details specific to coronaviruses to enable antiviral strategies against SARS-CoV-2 to be compared and to analyse their synergies. We demonstrate this via a comparative analysis of an antiviral treatment (remdesivir) and CP therapy, which apart from steriod treatment are the most prominent forms of therapy currently used against COVID-19 infections. In particular, we compare disease progression for different treatment starts and dosages, and thus provide new insights into these therapeutic options.",

Surprisingly, our model suggests that early treatment by either form of therapy alone can actually increase the duration of infection compared with a later royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R.

Our model also enabled us to perform a comparison between the antiviral treatment and CP therapy, and explore their potential synergistic effects. The model reveals that early into the infection an antiviral treatment using remdesivir could be more effective than CP therapy, and a combination therapy can significantly reduce the duration of infection. However, for later treatment starts, CP therapy appears to be more beneficial than antiviral therapy, and there are no longer any significant synergistic effects that would warrant combination therapy.

As SARS-CoV-2 is a novel infection, we assume that E(0) = 0 and that the basal level of effector cells is low (\u03bb E = 1 and d E \u00bc 0:5 d \u00c01 ) [53] . However, considering a higher basal level does not change model outcomes regarding the viral dynamics, as \u03b1 and \u03bc, the proliferation rates of effector cells and removal rate of",

            "text": "infected cells by effector cells, are estimated using viral load data fitting. Note that increasing \u03bb and decreasing \u03bc simultaneously does result in the same viral dynamics, although it will change the value of the peak in effector cells. Since data are only available regarding viral load, we decided to fix the basal level of effector cells before finding other parameters [42, 53] . Initially, there is no specific antibody, therefore A(0) = 0 and d A \u00bc 0:033 d \u00c01 [42] . We use 1 \u03bcg ml \u22121 immunoglobulin G (IgG) positive control as a strong positive standard [49] . Thus, we assume A m \u00bc 1 mg ml \u00c01 \u00bc 4 \u00c2 10 12 molecules ml \u22121 . Although we are setting the individual's antibody carrying capacity to a fixed value [42] , we also checked that variation of the parameter does not impact the qualitative results and therefore all conclusions remain valid. d A is measured for HBV infection, but it has been shown that r A A(1 \u2212 A/A m ) \u2212 d A A is equivalent to a logistic growth of antibodies with growth rate \u03c1 A = r A \u2212 d A [42] . Since we are fitting r A , fixing d A does not have a significant impact on the model. The same argument is valid for d E , and as we are assuming a fixed basal level (\u03bb E /d E ), changing d E would not have a significant effect on our results.The patient data used is only available from the time after onset of symptoms, and the initial viral load at the start of the infection is not recorded. We therefore estimate the value V(0) assuming the infection is transmitted via droplets. The average number of expelled droplets during talking is assumed to be 1000 [54, 55] . It has also been reported that more than 50% of droplets have a size range between 50 and 75 \u03bcm [55] . Thus, the average volume in expelled droplets during talking is equal to 1:1 \u00c2 10 \u00c04 ml. The median level of viral load on the day of symptom onset in patients in this study is estimated as 5 \u00c2 10 3 virion ml \u22121 [56] . We assume that infected individuals infect others before the onset of symptoms, and we therefore assume an average level of 10 3 virion ml \u22121 are available for transmission. Thus, assuming V\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0:1 virion ml \u22121 appears to be a reasonable choice [6] . This value is also comparable to those used in modelling of influenza [57] .Since structural identifiability is a necessary condition for model fitting, we used the method by Castro & de Boer [58] to show that our model (2.1) is structurally identifiable (see electronic supplementary material, section S3 for more detail). We estimate the remaining parameters and the incubation period (the time between the beginning of the infection and the onset of symptoms) by fitting V from the model (2.1) to patient data individually in Matlab using the method in Ciupe et al. [42] which uses the minimum search function for data fitting. Although we fitted patient data individually, which is suboptimal compared to population fitting using mixed effects, the outcomes of the model were in agreement with clinically measured values, such as the incubation period and the onset of appearance of antibodies in the body. The resulting parameter values are presented in table 1. Decreasing/increasing of V(0) (V\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0:01 virion ml \u22121 or V\u00f00\u00de \u00bc 1 virion ml \u22121 ) does not change the estimated values of parameters significantly and only changes the estimated incubation period by \u00b11 day. Additionally, we used residual bootstrapping to provide 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the parameter estimates following [37] (electronic supplementary material, table S2). For each set of patient data fV 1 ,V 2 , . . . ,V n g, we calculated the normalised residuals e i \u00bc V i =V i ,i \u00bc 1,2, . . . ,n, where fV 1 ,V 2 , . . . ,V n g denotes the viral load values predicted by the model. We then created the set fV \u00c3 1 ,V \u00c3 2 ,:::,V \u00c3 n g where V \u00c3 i \u00bc V i \u00c2 e j for e j randomly chosen to be any of the normalised residuals or 1, the latter to include the option that the data remains unchanged. We created 50 samples and fitted each individually to the data. We then calculated the 95% CI for each given parameter across the 50 parameter sets (electronic supplementary material, table S2). We generated 500 simulations based on randomly chosen parameters from the 50 parameter sets, and then used these curves to calculate the 95% CI for each patient (see red shaded areas in electronic supplementary material, figure S4 ). As the 95% CIs have negligible width compared with the widths of the curves, given the logarithmic scale, we also added the mean plus/minus standard deviation as shaded green areas in order to reflect the noise in the data, especially for P4 and P6. We note that the predicted two-peak behaviour is consistent with observations in W\u00f6lfel et al. [59] , and indeed is expected in any model that includes the adaptive immune response [60] . royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rsos R. Soc. Open Sci. 8: 210082",
