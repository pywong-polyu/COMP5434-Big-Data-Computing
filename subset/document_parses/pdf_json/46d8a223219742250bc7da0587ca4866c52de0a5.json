This paper sheds light on the less studied roles of Business Associations (BAs) in supporting women entrepreneurs to overcome the challenges and women's role in BAs. Despite the significance of BAs to small-scale businesses, the role of BAs as avenues for access to knowledge, network and mentoring for women entrepreneurs has been under-examined in literature on women's entrepreneurship/gender. The study compares three tourism sectors to study what facilitates the membership and leadership role of women entrepreneurs in the BAs. This study verified new avenues that can be introduced to support women entrepreneurs through BAs. In order to identify the nature of small-scale enterprises (SSE) in Sri Lanka, the first section deliberates on gender and entrepreneurship and how BAs support women entrepreneurs in tourism industry. The next section seeks to explain the methods of this study leading to section 3 wherein the main findings are illustrated leading to conclusion.",

            "text": "Another area of discussion in literature envisages the challenges faced by women entrepreneurs in work-family balance. Even though one of the important reasons why women start their own business is to balance between work and family, this often fails since their inability to afford sufficient paid help to replace themselves in the family (Ratten and Tajeddini, 2018) . There is a constant tension for women entrepreneurs between the demands of the family and children versus the demands of an expanding business in terms of investments in time as well as finances due to the gender-based division of labor in families and communities. Women entrepreneurs are often forced to prioritize investment in their children's education and food over enhancing their entrepreneurial skills for expanding their businesses (Arachchi and Gnanapala, 2020; Fernando and Kumari, 2020; Madurawala et al., 2016) . Women's roles in the household and family responsibilities are often unshared by men, and hence, such gender roles restrict the time available for business. A significant debate among scholars is on the relationship between entrepreneurship and women's household responsibilities that is whether entrepreneurship allows women to balance their family responsibilities with work (Surangi, 2018) or family responsibilities hinder women's entrepreneurial aspirations.",

            "text": "The third area that often discussed on women entrepreneurs is around the issue of gender norms that restrict women's mobility in public spaces and their access to information. Such restriction in mobility leads women to weaker social network, thereby creating another disadvantage on women entrepreneurs compared with men. Studying the gender differences between networks, Pryke (2017) found that people who have large number of contacts in different places have better access to information, which can make them more competitive. A number of studies have found that there is a significant difference between women's and men's networks (Watson, 2012; Bogren et al., 2013; Roomi et al., 2009) . Gender-based norms regarding appropriate behavior do impact on women's networks limiting their network to kinship-ties while men's networks remain much wider. With lack of access to skills, information, credit, and knowledge, women entrepreneurs tend to hold a low self-confidence. Some scholars admit that tourism entrepreneurship allows women to balance their family responsibilities with work, which is why it attracts more women (Tajeddini et al., 2017) . However, others argue that family responsibilities hinder women's entrepreneurial aspirations (Brush et al., 2009; Segovia-Perez et al., 2019) . Tourism is a sector where the needs and reality of women in enterprises are complexly intertwined as Surangi (2018:118) noted:",

Gender discriminatory practices in the business world created barriers to the flow of information, training, and networks in finance and banking, while multiple social roles related to family and childcare reduced women's confidence in small business enterprises (Madurawala et al., 2016) . Effective business networks, experienced mentors, and access to financial and business information and knowledge are crucial for women small-scale entrepreneurs to overcome structural and institutional barriers to growth.

Due to resource constraints, SMEs are more dependent on BAs for services such as information and contacts than multinational corporations (Bennett and Ramsden, 2007) . This is all the more critical in the case of women small-scale business entrepreneurs as women's access to finance, information and connections are limited by gender norms and institutional structures.

Gendered hierarchy in organizations is maintained through arguments about women's reproductive responsibilities.

To draw an equitable comparison between women and men entrepreneurs, an equal proportion of men entrepreneurs (195) were selected from the total number of men in the 2014 statistics (total of 542). The same number of men respondents with women entrepreneurs were selected for each category (accommodation, F&B, retail) using the stratified random sampling method (using a random number table from the list at Hikkaduwa Urban Council office for each business category). Hence, the total sample for semi-structured questionnaire survey was 390. The semi-structured questionnaire survey was used with the intent of collecting information under three segments; (1) personal information of the small scale business owners (2) performances of the business and (3) women's empowerment in business (control over business decisions, representing the business to the business circle, participation in BA activities, decision making in the household). The first author made an appointment with each respondent by calling them on telephone, later having set up the appointments at the time and place of the respondents' convenience. In order to conduct the semi structured interviews, the first author sought the help of two women research assistants. One interview lasted for around 45 min. The third tool of primary data collection was in-depth interviews in order to examine the reasons for the pattern discovered in the questionnaire survey. In-depth interviews enabled the researcher to obtain a holistic understanding of the perceptions about their business, their future prospects, and their relationships with other family members and other members in the business circle. Twenty-four in-depth interviews (12 women, 12 men) were conducted with four male and four female entrepreneurs from each of the three sectors (accommodation, food and beverage, retail). Respondents were selected from among the semi-structured survey respondents on the basis of the rapport established between the informants and interviewer during the questionnaire survey. Respondents who were willing to share detailed business data and whose survey data revealed interesting nuances to the case were purposively selected for in-depth interviews.",

The transcribed text was coded observing connections, patterns and meanings that is relevant to the objective. The analysis was driven by the data itself. The discussion focused on factors that determine men and women's role in BA and the sectoral difference of these factors. Some of the questions that were investigated were: how being male or female has made an impact on running the small scale enterprise, what are the differences among men and women in BA activities, how do they understand role of BA as an entrepreneurial support agent, what are their experience in their participation in BA.",

Although BAs can significantly support women entrepreneurs, the male-dominated structure keeps women disempowered. Lack of experience and the demands of family duties are often used by men as an excuse to deny women leadership positions in BAs.",

However, when women seek entry into powerful networks to expand their businesses, they encounter the glass ceiling within BAs. BAs are similar to other organizations in terms of how their structures and processes operate to maintain existing structures of power and privilege. This study shows that since the existence of BAs, women's membership has not increased their role in BAs office bearers and leadership. Organizations perpetuate male dominance which not only make running businesses difficult for women, but also exclude women from positions of power and influence, and from powerful networks. While BAs have the potential to be useful to women entrepreneurs, the male-dominated culture of BA leadership marginalizes women and hence the potential is not fully utilized, as was also seen by Plaza et al.
