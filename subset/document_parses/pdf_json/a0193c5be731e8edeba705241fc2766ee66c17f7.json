            "text": "How do students discover ecology? Answering this question is essential for diversifying the environmental workforce because scientific disciplines, such as ecology, are often not discovered until students enter academia and are exposed to different disciplinary options. Ecology, and many of the environmental sciences, have persistent and alarmingly low numbers of underrepresented minorities (URM; African American, Hispanic American, Native American, and Pacific Islanders), while other science and technology fields have shown progress in diversification. Why does such underrepresentation persist in environmental disciplines? Social factors such as sense of belonging, science identity, implicit biases, and stereotypes all have been explored and are known to influence the participation of URM students in science. The unique role of the field experience in environmental sciences as a \"rite of passage\" and \"authentic\" research experience is one important influence on how URM students experience ecology. Interventions using social elements such as belonging and sense of place are demonstrated ways to broaden participation particularly in environmental science fields, yet dramatic underrepresentation still persists. Here we review known factors affecting and enhancing the recruitment and retention of URMs in the sciences and focus on comprehensive strategies shown to be effective recruiting URM students into the environmental workforce.",

As background, in 1992, the Ecological Society of America (ESA) surveyed the diversity of its membership (Lawrence et al. 1993a ). At the time, the data showed <5% ethnic diversity in ESA members. Approaching the ESA centennial in 2015, more than 20 yr later, ESA membership had reached at most 9% (Beck et al. 2014) . The same survey also assessed how members had first become interested in ecology (Lawrence et al. 1993b) . Sixty percent of the respondents had discovered ecology at an early age by participating in some guided field experience program and 32% were introduced to the discipline by a college professor. More recent data in 2015 continued to show the importance of mentors and field experiences in their discovery of ecology. 4 Minority communities are not less interested or engaged in the environmental issues associated with ecology as a whole (Leiserowitz et al. 2018) . The impacts of global climate change and associated environmental problems tend to be concentrated in communities of Manuscript (Otto et al. 2017 ) and the juxtaposition of poor communities of color and environmental toxins laid the foundations for environmental justice research, policies, and activism (Bullard 2018, Pearson and Schuldt 2018) .",

The need to make the environmental workforce match the increasingly diverse demographics of human communities has prompted research inquiry on what factors specifically affect URM students' career choices in environmental science fields. For environmental careers, elements influencing URM engagement include many different factors such as family support (Armstrong et al. 2007) , participation in guided experiences in nature appreciation (whether in urban or more natural field sites; Aloisio et al. 2018) , exposure to careers in ecology (Morales et al. 2020) , connecting environmental study in some way to interests in solving local and global community problems that affect minorities , and field research experiences as high school or college students in any type of environmental setting (Flowers et al. 2016 , Burrow 2018 , O'Connell et al. 2018 , Beltran et al. 2020 ). All of these experiences can lead URM students into further study of the environment. However, even with engagement by good mentors, URM students face additional barriers that include a lack of connection between the scientific field research opportunities, and life in their own communities (Hugo et al. 2013) in ways that do not promote comfort and engagement in studying environmental issues of interest (Miriti 2019 ).",

Since environmental study often requires field work, research has focused on internal factors associated with the rites of passage connected to the field experiences that create a sense of identity and belonging as an ecologist (Morales et al. 2020) . Field experiences, whether a formal field class or research experience in outdoor settings, are considered a critical part of how students choose to enter the environmental workforce (Kloser et al. 2013 , Flowers et al. 2016 , Thompson et al. 2016 , Fleischner et al. 2017 , Berkowitz et al. 2018 , Beltran et al. 2020 . Many programs require students to have research experiences and professional organizations often rate these experiences as critical for employment (Haynes and Jacobson 2015) . The field experience for applied ecology professions is a pivotal experience that can be a barrier, or an enabler, of student participation especially for underrepresented groups. The connection between appreciation for issues of global environmental concern (climate change, environmental justice for example) and the pursuit of ecological study at the college level has not been effectively made for most URM students (Taylor 2017 , Hansen et al. 2018 .",

The 4DEE stresses the importance of science communication, field work experience and data/technology skills as consistent and critical parts of such instruction. The 4DEE curriculum focuses on what content to cover in college courses to better address the needs of societal-environmental problem-solving (Smith et al. 2019) . Bringing human dimensions into ecological studies and field experiences is complex and, outside of urban field experiences, does not appear to be a widely used in ecology and potentially could engage more URM students (Russ et al. 2015 , Taylor 2017 .",

An example of a multifactor intervention is the Rocky Mountain Science and Sustainability Network's (RMSSN) academy, started with a five-year grant from the National Science Foundation to G. Bowser and M. A. Brown in 2009 (NSF DBI0956059; DBI#1624191) , to form a research coordination network in undergraduate biology education (RCN-UBE). RMSSN was an informal learning program to teach ecology and environmental sciences, with several distinct goals: (1) engage underrepresented students in a field experience to have them build capacity in designing experiments around core ecological concepts, (2) provide a team-based experiences to build confidence in understanding data design and scientific inquiry; (3) build a sense of belonging for all students to be a part of science inquiry, and (4) provide critical thinking skills and data analysis around a sense of place associated with applied ecological principles. Connecting local ecological issues to global issues, and engagement in citizen science has been a valuable component and a critical assessment component for students post RMSSN academy (Gretzel et al. 2014 , Halliwell and Bowser 2019 , Halliwell et al. 2020 ; Fig. 3 ).",

Applicants share how they view environmental issues as well as their own assessment of what a leader is. The RMSSN application avoids questions that put emphasis on field skills (e.g., have you ever been camping?) or easy-to-learn skills (do you know how to set up a tent?). Such reframing of questions about skills can raise the applicants' perception of their ability to be leaders in a novel or unfamiliar setting. Using social skills, such as the ability to work with or lead a group of peers (e.g., have you ever led a team of your peers on a novel adventure?), as the core metric for a field experience, elevates a different pool of applicants who see themselves as leaders regardless of their experience in actual field settings. This first step is critical, yet often is overlooked, as the application process itself can discourage students from even considering the experience and/or the field of ecology itself. These early interventions can bring different students into ecology by focusing on skillsets they can define themselves (I see myself as a leader because. . .) regardless of whether the student is from an urban apartment building or rural farming community.",

SEEDS students participate in group field trips to an important ecological site with faculty mentors, attend a leadership gathering at the annual ESA conference, where they are assigned mentors, and engage in scientific and social activities. A series of short multifactor interventions (3-4 d to 1 week) take place over a year that include developing professional skills, group projects, social components, reflection, and sharing .

An ecological mindset is an outcome when observations of patterns are combined with developing a sense of identity and belonging within the field of ecology.

Mostly will not work. . .\" (Skrip 2015) . Barriers to underrepresentation by a specific minority group can be subtle and hard to detect. The integration of cultural competency with traditional pedagogy needs to occur in ecology, especially in field settings, such as research stations or field camps, where the sense of belonging and identity experienced by majority demographic can create barriers for those from diverse cultural groups. Field experiences work when they are combined with team-building exercises that create a sense of belonging and provide that rite of passage for all students leading toward a lifelong passion for ecology (Thompson et al. 2016 , Halliwell et al. 2020 . The sense of place component works when combined with a connection to the students' family values/cultural heritage and upbringing that also creates a sense of belonging for participating students: \"My people were here too and I am not the first!\" (African American student response on discovering the story of Buffalo Soldiers in Yellowstone National Park [Halliwell and Bowser 2019] ). Recent acknowledgements from land grant institutions of the prior sovereign nations lands upon which they sit represent one path that highlights the value of telling the stories that respect the importance of place (Lee and Ahtone 2020) . Such stories help reconnect all students with the culture of the landscapes providing them with perspectives of the many diverse cultures embedded with the same landscape. Similar acknowledgments in field locations create that same connection to the cultural landscape, woven tightly around the ecological processes themselves and creating special bonds for different cultural and demographic groups. Groups that may have Notes: The 4Cs are comfort, connection, confidence, and capacity. All students accepted in the program need to be assessed pre-field experience for measures of success indicated. called the landscape home or trace historical routes or passages find meanings that connect to that sense of belonging and place. Mentoring models for diversity advocates and allies need to include stories that combine a sense of belonging and a sense of place that acknowledges the diversity of students entering academia today.",

Why is this urgent and relevant today? Rapid global environmental change and increasing impacts of wildlife-human disease transfer provide an immediate sense of urgency since the people who are most impacted by these changes are the same who are left out or pushed out of science careers. Such affected groups need to have access to robust scientific data that are provided within their cultural context and by scientists who reflect those same audiences (Fig. 5) . Communicating science in a culturally competent and relevant manner has never been more critical, especially as the world seeks solutions for global challenges like the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change. Developing an \"ecological scientist mindset\" in all students, regardless of cultural identity, promotes global wellbeing and sustainability. Moving forward, having a science workforce that is not only integrated but works together across cultural spaces and identifies as a science community with shared data knowledge should be our common vision for our students and future practitioners of science.",
