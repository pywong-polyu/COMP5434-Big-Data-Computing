The research was conducted as a correlational descriptive study and included 253 nurses working in a university hospital in Turkey between October and December 2020. The data were collected via an online survey using psychometrically valid scales to assess the nurses' compassion and provision of spiritual care therapeutics. The nurses had a high compassion level and a medium level of spiritual care therapeutics. Compassion level explained 31% of the frequency of spiritual care therapeutics. As nurses' compassion levels increased, the frequency of their provision of spiritual care therapeutics to patients also increased.",

Spiritual care comprises interventions aimed at strengthening healthy and sick individuals through coping mechanisms against stressful situations as well as providing counselling for some situations and interpreting the situations that individuals experience (Saraco\u011flu 2019). In this context, spiritual care addresses the needs of the spirit when the individual experiences disease or sorrow. It also includes the individual being understood, receiving belief support, engaging in prayer, or just being listened to. Spiritual care starts with compassionate relationships (Giske et al. 2015) . Therapeutic approaches such as establishing safe relations with the patient, showing empathy, listening to the patient's concerns and values, learning about the patient's religious beliefs that affect the meaning of the illness and supporting the patient's religious beliefs and practices are nursing interventions within the scope of spiritual care .",

One of these personal factors is nurses' compassion levels. Nurse compassion is effective in increasing patient satisfaction, accelerating the recovery process and decreasing the length of hospital stay and treatment costs (Dewar et al. 2013; Dalgal\u0131 et al. 2018) . Additionally, compassion enables nurses to establish therapeutic communication with patients and facilitates their ability to understand patients, recognize their emotions and needs and meet their spiritual needs (Uslu et al. 2016) . Studies indicated that nurses have high compassion levels (Arl\u0131 et al. 2018; B\u00fcy\u00fck et al. 2021; \u00c7ing\u00f6l et al. 2018; \u0130\u015fg\u00f6r 2017; Meyer et al. 2015; Karada\u011f et al. 2018) .
