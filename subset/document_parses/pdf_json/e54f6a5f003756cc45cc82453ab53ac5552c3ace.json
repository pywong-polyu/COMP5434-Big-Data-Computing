            "text": "Purpose: Coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic is the significant public health crisis of the 21st century that has disrupted personal, local, and international territorial relationships. Earlier studies have shown that people with HIV were at least twice at risk of dying from COVID-19 than the general population. There are also deep concerns about the indirect impact of COVID-19 on women within the reproductive age group in Sub-Saharan Africa who were already struggling to access reproductive healthcare services. In addition, pregnant HIV-positive women have an increased rate of anxiety and depression. This study, therefore, examined depression and anxiety disorders in pregnant HIV-positive women in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients and Methods: This cross-sectional study used a structured questionnaire containing sociodemographic information, Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and General Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) assessment tools. Data obtained were analyzed using Statistical Package for Social Science version 26. Results: Ninety-nine (99) representing 78% of 127 pregnant HIV-positive women enrolled in the PMTCT program were eligible for this study. This number matched 99 randomly selected pregnant HIV-negative in the study areas as controls. Major depressive disorder (MDD) and severe anxiety disorder were significantly higher among the HIV-positive group than in the HIV-negative group (PHQ-9 Mean \u00b1 SD 8.0 \u00b1 5.4 vs 2.3 \u00b1 2.9; p = 0.000) and (GAD-7 Mean \u00b1 SD 5.9 \u00b1 4.6 vs 1.2 \u00b1 2.2; p = 0.000). Conclusion: Given the high prevalence of major depressive disorder and severe anxiety disorder among pregnant HIV-positive women, mental health care should be incorporated into the prevention with positive interventions and strategies to reduce the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan city of China in late December 2019 has dramatically impacted lives and relationships. 1, 2 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been described by WHO as the leading health crisis of the 21st century. [3] [4] [5] It seems that the coronavirus will be around for a long time. Although there was an initial decline in its pandemic curve, another wave of COVID-19 is rapidly re-surfacing in most countries of the world, 6 hence, the need to devise strategies to continue to neutralize its direct and indirect effects on morbidity and mortality. Most countries in the world have improved their human capital over the past decades; unfortunately, this is being threatened by the impact of the pandemic on healthcare, citizens' liberties, and the economies of nations. There are deep concerns about the indirect impact of COVID-19 on women within the reproductive age group who already struggle to access reproductive healthcare services, particularly in resource-constrained countries. Shreds of evidence have supported that COVID-19 affects pregnant women and those who have co-morbidities disproportionately. 7, 8 Although Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) presents a more chronic progression than COVID-19, it continues to be a significant global public health issue, having claimed more than a 36.3 million lives so far. 9 The availability of antiretroviral drugs has reduced HIV infection to chronic disease. HIV-positive women now live longer, achieve pregnancies, and are exposed to and infected with SARS-CoV-2. Earlier studies from South Africa and the United Kingdom have shown that people living with HIV were at least twice at risk of dying from COVID-19 than the general population. [10] [11] [12] There is a consensus among studies that the highest risk of mortality is among blacks, Asians, and other people from minority ethnic communities living with HIV. [10] [11] [12] [13] Contrary to the above, a scoping review of literature by Prabhu et al did not show a higher risk of morbidity from Covid-19 among HIV-positive people compared to the general population. 13, 14 Supposedly, pregnancy should be a period of psychological well-being, particularly among Africans with a high premium on childbearing. However, mental health disorders are prevalent among African women during pregnancy. 15 Depression and anxiety disorders are the most common mental health disorders frequently encountered in pregnancy. The literature has quoted a prevalence of 13% and 12%, respectively. 16, 17 According to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines, various forms of anxiety disorders (including generalized anxiety disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, phobias, post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety disorder, and tokophobia (extreme fear of childbirth), and depression are under-recognized throughout pregnancy and the postnatal period. 18 Mothers with these disorders may not get proper antenatal care services and pay less attention to their health status. Studies have shown that depression and anxiety are associated with low birth weight, preterm delivery, and intrauterine growth restriction. [19] [20] [21] These may be due to the stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis by the physical and psychological stressors associated with maternal depression and anxiety disorders. 22 In the postpartum period, there may be a problem with proper bonding between the mothers with mental health disorders and their newborns, reduced attention for the care of newborns with the risk for infant infections, under-immunization, malnutrition, impaired childhood growth and development, and even behavioral problems culminating into developing mental disorders in adulthood. 23, 24 Expectedly, pregnant HIV-positive women will have a heightened rate of anxiety and depression. 25, 26 The current escalating COVID-19 pandemic may worsen this. This study investigated the prevalence of depression and anxiety among pregnant HIV-positive women during the COVID-19 pandemic. The PHQ-9 27 and GAD-7 28 scales were used to measure depression and anxiety, respectively, in pregnant HIV-positive women as cases, and the outcome was compared with those of pregnant HIV-negative women who will serve as controls. This study was the first to address this subject in our environment and the first to compare the prevalence of depression and anxiety among HIV-positive and HIV-negative. This study would serve as a baseline for comparing future studies. In addition, the outcome of this study will help formulate management plans that will mitigate the indirect impact of COVID-19 on people living with HIV.",

After completing the first section, the participants were counseled to tick their desired answers in section two, which assessed depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) and anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorders-7 (GAD-7). The questions were explained verbally in the requisite local language (Yoruba) for those not fluent in English. The questionnaire was pretested to avoid possible ambiguity by administering it to 50 randomly selected antenatal clinic attendees at the Ekiti State University Teaching Hospital in the month preceding the month of commencement of the research. The coefficient of reliability of 0.85 was obtained, which was considered appropriate.",

            "text": "COVID-19 pandemic heralded an unprecedented heightened psychosocial distress among everyone and everywhere. This current study compares depression and anxiety among pregnant HIV-positive and HIV-negative women during the current COVID-19 pandemic. This study revealed that 49.5% of pregnant HIV-positive women met the criteria for major depressive disorder MDD (PHQ-9 \u226510) with a mean and standard deviation (PHQ-9 Mean \u00b1 SD 8.0 \u00b1 5.4 vs 2.3 \u00b1 2.9; p = 0.000). The study also observed that 37.4% of pregnant HIV-positive women have severe anxiety disorder with a mean and standard deviation (GAD-7 Mean \u00b1 SD 5.9 \u00b1 4.6 vs 1.2 \u00b1 2.2; p = 0.000). Various researchers have observed that pregnant women are physiologically prone to mental disorders during stressful life events due to the elevation in plasma cortisol levels. 21 While this may be one of the reasons for the high rate of psychological morbidity among the participants during the pandemic, others have also observed that women living with HIV have an increased prevalence of most common mental health disorders 10-13. Although studies have shown that common mental disorders like depression and anxiety are common in pregnancy, 16, 29, 30 there have been few studies among pregnant HIVpositive women. 31, 32 We are not aware of any study that has compared depression and anxiety among HIV-positive and HIVnegative pregnant women in our environment. In Nigeria, Thompson and Ajayi 33 found a prevalence of antenatal depression of 24.5% among pregnant women; similarly, in a study done in Ekiti State among pregnant women, psychological morbidity was 36.7%. 34 These prevalence rates are far less than 49.5% found among HIV-positive pregnant women but slightly higher than 21. 4128 anxiety (25% and 24.3%) and (32.5% and 28.9%) in Tanzania and Ethiopia respectively. The prevalence of depression and anxiety found in these studies was far less than in our study conducted during the COVID-19 pandemic. The finding of significantly higher mean age of pregnant HIV-positive women than the HIV-negative women seen in this study (34.2\u00b14.1 vs 32.0\u00b13.5) may be due to stigmatization, higher use of family planning and more reported cases of union dissolution may delay marriage, conception and childbearing among the HIV-positive women. [35] [36] [37] This study also found a strong association between marriage type and psychiatric morbidity among HIV-positive patients. Frequent marital disharmony in polygamous marriages in southwestern Nigeria may be responsible for this finding. This finding supports previous meta-analyses that have indicated that women in polygamous family settings are more susceptible to worsened mental health than their monogamous counterparts. 38, 39 A significant limitation of this study is the small sample size. However, this may have little effect on outcome because the prevalence of HIV in Ekiti State is about 2.9% according to the 2014 sentinel survey. 38, 40 Another limitation is the study's crosssectional nature, which makes it difficult to establish causality.",

We, however, found a higher prevalence of these mental disorders in pregnant HIV-positive women than those found by other researchers before the advent of the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the findings in this study may suggest that the COVID-19 pandemic has heightened depression and anxiety in pregnant HIV-positive women. We suggest that mental health care should be incorporated into the prevention with positive intervention and strategies to fill this conspicuous mental health gap and mitigate against the indirect consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic among HIV-positive pregnant women.",
