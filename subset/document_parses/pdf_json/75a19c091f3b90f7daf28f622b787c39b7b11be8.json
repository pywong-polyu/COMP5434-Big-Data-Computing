With more and more people getting affected during the second wave, the hospitals were over-burdened, running out of supplies and oxygen. In this scenario, prediction of the number of COVID-19 cases beforehand might have helped in the better utilization of limited resources and supplies. This manuscript deals with the prediction of new COVID-19 cases, new deaths and total active cases for multiple days in advance. The proposed method uses gated recurrent unit networks as the main predicting model. A study is conducted by building four models that are pre-trained on the data from four different countries (United States of America, Brazil, Spain and Bangladesh) and are fine-tuned or retrained on India's data. Since the four countries chosen have experienced different types of infection curves, the pre-training provides a transfer learning to the models incorporating diverse situations into account. Each of the four models then give a multiple days ahead predictions using recursive learning method for the Indian test data. The final prediction comes from an ensemble of the predictions of the combination of different models. This method with two countries, Spain and Brazil, is seen to achieve the best performance amongst all the combinations as well as compared to other traditional regression models.",

Owing to the nation wide lockdown starting from 24 March 2020, imposed by the Indian government, the number of COVID-19 cases in the first wave were limited. However, with the opening up of the cities, its' transport systems and allowance of various festivities, India has faced a very severe second wave with the peak at almost 4 lakh new cases a day. Although the peak seems to be over, the actual number of people to be affected in the coming days is very difficult to determine. There had been an exponential rise [14] of new cases in the second wave and as of 13 August 2021, there are close to 4 lakh active COVID-19 cases in India.",

Various mathematical models have been used to predict and to understand the spread of the disease [3] . Auto-regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARI-MA) has been used [21, 11] as the standard model to predict the behaviour of the infection curves in different countries. The model was able to capture the total case statistics because the number of total cases is seen to follow a standard exponential curve. The number of new cases each day is highly uncertain and involves a lot many variables. Therefore, it is much more difficult to handle using ARIMA [16] . Researchers [22] have therefore explored support vector machines to predict the daily COVID-19 cases. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have also been tested and have become the state of the art models for predicting the daily number of cases. Researchers [19] have compared various RNN models like Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) [9] , Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and Bi-LSTMs. They have observed that these models are much more robust when compared to ARIMA or Support Vector Regression (SVR) [24] . Transfer learning and ensemble modelling has also been applied to study the statistics of daily COVID-19 cases [5] and it has shown to perform even better than the standard LSTM-RNNs.",

It takes some time to get these supplies and the patients might be critical in that period. Therefore, a predictive method for several days, providing the number of new cases per day, fatalities per day and total active cases has been proposed in this manuscript. Some researchers [18] have attempted the multi-step prediction of cumulative COVID-19 cases. However, multi-step prediction of daily new cases, daily fatalities and total active cases simultaneously is difficult due to their chaotic nature. The proposed model alleviates these problems and gives a multivariate multi-day prediction for the daily statistics.",

To achieve this, the proposed method uses a combination of several learning methodologies and integrates them into one.

We have, therefore experimented on the variation of RMSE with the look-back period. After experimenting, the look-back period of 14 days has been found out to giving the best results. A grid search methodology was also followed for finding the right hyper-parameters (learning rate, epochs of training etc) for the GRU model.

The results are shown separately for the 3 COVID-19 parameters predicted in this study. For doing an in-depth analysis, the effect of finetuning on Indian data is also seen by showing the results for the above mentioned methods without fine-tuning in Table  2 . To see the stability of the analysis, all the results have been shown as an average of 20 independent runs, with the standard deviation in the results shown as well in Figures  2 to 4 .
