One in four dieticians considered quitting his/her job. While 65.8% of participants reported counseling COVID-19 patients, a third did not use any online platform for counseling. The most cited challenge to dietetic practice during the pandemic was 'maintaining work-life balance' (43.1%). The mean CD-RISC score was 72.0 \u00b1 14.0. After adjustment, working in a hospital or public clinic (as opposed to private clinic), having a condition preventing face-to-face counseling, considering quitting job and feeling neutral or dissatisfied with the appreciation were associated with lower resilience scores, while counseling COVID-19 patients was associated with higher scores.",

They are integral members of the healthcare team, and they play a role in maintaining the health and wellness of individuals and communities, especially in the care and control of patients with chronic diseases. Similar to other healthcare professionals, dieticians faced personal and professional challenges during the pandemic and were at risk of occupational stress and burnout [2] . Dieticians have played an integral role in caring for COVID-19 patients, especially those who are hospitalized and are at increased risk of malnutrition or wasting during the hospital stay [5] . Dieticians have a role in ensuring the safe delivery of nutrient-rich foods through feeding tubes to help them recover and regain the muscle mass and weight that may have been lost [4] . They are experts in determining the nutritional demands of each patient, taking into account their age, gender, and underlying medical conditions. In addition to that, patients with pre-existing health conditions such as diabetes, cancer, and obesity, also require continuous support from dieticians. As such, dieticians have used telehealth techniques such as video conferencing and online consultations to support these patients during lockdowns [4] . Likewise, dieticians have helped clients in reducing stress through lifestyle, exercise, food, and sleep information and resources; both in-person and virtually to reach the greatest number of clients. Studies reported a 41% increase in the use of telehealth among dieticians for providing care as compared to the period prior to the pandemic [6] . The expectation was that dieticians will adapt rapidly to the changes occurring in the delivery of care; however, several concerns were raised by them, including but not limited to billing and reimbursement, best practices, and health insurance coverage [6] .",

Additionally, job insecurity and uncertainty about the virus might impact dieticians' quality of life [8] . Recent studies from Brazil revealed that dieticians' well-being and quality of life have decreased during the pandemic due to poor compensation and lack of professional recognition [7, 8] . The physical and mental well-being of dieticians, similar to other healthcare professionals, is directly linked to their work performance and quality of life. On the same note, healthcare professionals who are experiencing job stressors and low job satisfaction are more likely to quit their jobs and provide poor quality services [9] .",

Whereas family-work conflict is a form of interrole conflict that occurs when the pressure of personal and family life interferes with work responsibilities [10] . A recent study showed that 47.2% of registered dieticians experience work-family conflict and 14.8% experience family-work conflict [3] . It is evident that the presence of work-family conflict is associated with lower life satisfaction, increased burnout, and higher turnover intention. The fact that the dietician workforce is a female majority presents additional pressures and risks since it has been demonstrated in literature that professional working females are disproportionally affected by work-life imbalances and may be at higher risks of professional burnout and turnover [11] .",

Along with this transition, the prevalence of obesity and other cardio-metabolic disorders has increased [18, 19] . Dietary change is one of the key strategies to treat and reduce obesity [20] . Dieticians are the key players in this strategy as they are specialized with weight management, in addition to their significant role in treating COVID-19 patients. Therefore, enhancing the resilience of dieticians is essential to improve the health and well-being of the population. The main objectives of this national study were to investigate the conditions and changes of the work environment of UAE dieticians during the COVID-19 pandemic and examine their resilience levels and the factors associated with it. The study aims at suggesting a number of evidence-based policy and practice recommendations that could support the practice of dieticians, enhance their resilience and eventually improve their satisfaction and retention in the UAE labor market.",

The link for this questionnaire was sent to dieticians by phone and by email. In the absence of an inclusive registry for all dieticians practicing in the UAE, a multitude of sources were sought to maximize the reach of the survey. More specifically, lists of names and contacts of dieticians were obtained from the Ministry of Health (MOH), Dubai Health Authority (DHA), as well as alumni of the various nutrition and dietetics programs in the country. Given that some of these lists may overlap and to avoid duplication of data collection, dieticians were asked not to complete the questionnaire should they have previously participated in this study. Prior to filling the questionnaire, participants read and signed an informed consent which included information about the purpose of the study, its protocol, and time needed to complete the questionnaire. The anonymity and voluntary nature of participation were also stated in the consent form. Once dieticians agreed to participate, they were given the choice to complete the questionnaire in either the English or Arabic language. The study protocol as well as the English and Arabic versions of the consent form and questionnaires were reviewed and approved by the Research and Ethics Committee at the University. Data collection took place between January and May of year 2020.",

Table 1 described the characteristics of the study participants. The sample had a higher proportion of female participants as compared to males (87.6% vs. 12.4%) and consisted of rather young dieticians, with participants 45 years and older making up only 14.4% of the total sample. A bit shy of two thirds of respondent had a Bachelor of Science degree (65.2%). Around 40% of participants reported being licensed by the MOH, 32% by DHA, while 18.1% of participants had a license to practice from another country in addition to that from the UAE. More than half of responding dieticians worked in hospitals (56.1%) while the rest were distributed almost equally between private and public health clinics ( Table 1) . The practice-related characteristics during the COVID-19 pandemic of study respondents are described in Table 2 . Almost 14% of participants indicated that they do not feel well equipped with the required knowledge and skills to practice during a pandemic and 26.4% reported not having access to PPE and supplies to safely carry out the work with patients. Half of the responding dieticians reported being concerned to a large extent for their safety and health while practicing during the pandemic. Furthermore, 45% of respondents were either neutral or dissatisfied with the support they received for practicing during the pandemic. In addition, 37.7% of respondents also reported being neutral or dissatisfied with the appreciation they received during the pandemic. Among participants, 1 in 4 dieticians had considered quitting his/her job. While 68.7% of respondents indicated working from home, 65.8% reported counseling COVID-19 patients (Table 2) . Table 3 outlined the reflections of study participants with regards to practicing during the pandemic. With regards to online counseling, a third of the responding dieticians did not use any online platform for counseling while 61.4% and 36.2% indicated they needed to improve their online counseling techniques and their computer-based skills for online platforms such as Zoom and Microsoft Teams, respectively. Of dieticians who conducted online counseling, 11.8% did not follow up With regards to the results of the resilience assessment, the mean score of the CD-RISC was 72.0 \u00b1 14.0. As for the internal consistency of this questionnaire, the Cronbach alpha of the 25 items was 0.946. The means \u00b1 SD of the scores corresponding to the five resilience domains as measured by the CD-RISC are presented in Fig. 1 . Spirituality had the highest mean score (4.3) followed by the personal competence, high standards, and tenacity (3.9). Trust in one's instinct, tolerance of negative effects, and strengthening effects of stress had the least mean score (3.6). After adjustment, the results of the multiple linear regression presented in Table 4 showed that, compared to dieticians practicing in private clinics, those working in hospitals or public clinics had significantly lower resilience score (\u03b2 = \u2212 5.4, CI \u2212 9.24, \u2212 1.48 and \u03b2 = \u2212 5.7, CI \u2212 10.53, \u2212 0.92, respectively). In addition, dieticians having a condition preventing them from face-to-face counseling had lower resilience scores (\u03b2 = \u2212 3.7, CI \u2212 7.01, \u2212 0.41). Better resilience was also negatively associated with considering quitting job (\u03b2 = \u2212 5.0, CI \u2212 8.39, \u2212 1.58) and with feeling neutral or dissatisfied with the appreciation received as a practicing dietician during the pandemic (\u03b2 = \u2212 3.2, CI \u2212 6.27, \u2212 0.13).

Study findings showed that half of the dieticians were to a large extent concerned for their safety and health while practicing and a comparable proportion did not feel that their practice is adequately supported during the pandemic. Close to two thirds of dieticians were involved in caring for COVID-19 patients and 38% were either neutral or dissatisfied with the appreciation they received for their services. Perhaps most disconcerting was the fact that a quarter of the surveyed dieticians indicated consideration for quitting their jobs. Three out of each five dieticians expressed the need to enhance their online counselling skills and confirmed the subjective reporting of anthropometric measurements by the patients they were counselling during the pandemic. Among the challenges to dietetic practice during the pandemic, maintaining work-life balance was the top challenge (43.1%) followed by keeping positive energy (39.6%) and maintaining face-to-face counseling (39.6%). Dieticians reported relatively high resilience scores with the spirituality domain being the highest and the trust in one's instinct, tolerance of negative effects, and strengthening effects of stress being the lowest. While counselling COVID-19 patients was positively associated with higher resilience scores, hospital employment, having a condition preventing face-to-face counselling, considering quitting job and being neutral or dissatisfied with appreciation received during the pandemic were negatively associated with resilience scores.",

While much focus was dedicated to appreciating and supporting frontline physicians and nurses caring for the COVID-19 patients during the pandemic [23] , and rightfully so, supporting the practice of dieticians may not have been viewed as a comparable priority despite their valuable services to COVID-19 patients. The lack of support became more evident with 45% of respondents being either neutral or dissatisfied with the support they received for practicing during the pandemic. Support during the pandemic is not a luxury, especially if it safeguards an optimal delivery of patient care. It is disconcerting that half of the responding dieticians expressed a large degree of concern over the safety of their practice. Safe practice enables at the basic level providing dieticians who maintained face-to-face counselling with adequate access to PPE (26% indicated not having adequate access) and supporting dieticians working from home with training on effective techniques for safe and secure online counselling. Such support extends beyond the basic training on using online conferencing software to valid and effective collection of anthropometric measurements using digital technologies and online tools. Tools that may improve telemedicine services by dieticians include pedometers and wearables, electronic home-scales, and continuous glucose monitoring. On the same note, the adoption of digital health platforms such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Health Informatics Infrastructure (ANDHII), an electronic webbased tool, can allow dieticians to remotely monitor and evaluate their patients [24] . Study findings also revealed that the level of dissatisfaction during the pandemic has not only affected the delivery of safe and effective patient care, but also caused the destabilization of the workforce with a quarter of surveyed dieticians indicating consideration for quitting their jobs. A comparable proportion of dieticians indicated concerns over their job security. Furthermore, two out of each five dieticians indicated challenges in maintaining work-life balance, maintaining positive energy, and offering face-to-face counselling. The abovementioned results call on concerned public and private decision and policy makers to immediately and effectively respond to the needs of dieticians to enable them to maintain safe practice, enhance their satisfaction and improve their retention.",

Yet such an investigation has not been previously carried out on dieticians in the Middle East region. The mean resilience score in this study was 72.0 \u00b1 14.0, which falls relatively higher as compared to investigations carried out on other health professionals in the region [26, 27] . Zooming into the specific resilience domains, analysis revealed that spirituality had the highest mean score followed by the personal competence, high standards, and tenacity. Spirituality plays an important role in the Middle East region, particularly among Muslim populations [28] . Previous studies have reported significant associations between spirituality and mental health outcomes such as anxiety, depression, self-esteem, hope and optimism, and overall well-being [29] . Further studies from the Middle East also revealed that spirituality encompasses both personal and professional lives of individuals [28] . We could thus infer that spirituality played a significant role in dieticians' ability to cope with the COVID-19 pandemic. While participants in this study had a relatively high rating in their competence as dieticians, they had the lowest rating for trust in one's instinct, tolerance of negative effects, and strengthening effects of stress. The findings, hence, highlight an opportunity for policy and decision makers to support the dietician workforce by offering stress relief programs to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic. These programs have been implemented elsewhere, covering several areas: providing leisure activities, training on psychological skills to deal with multiple stressors, ensuring regular visits from psychological counsellors to support staff and listen to their stories, and providing a safe place where healthcare workers can rest and temporarily isolate themselves from their families a \u00df represents the linear regression coefficients. Significant \u00df (< 0.05) are bolded * Adjusted for age, gender and variables that were significant (0.05) in the simple linear regression were entered in the multiple regression model when needed [30] . Implementing such psychological support interventions is expected to help dieticians reduce stress to better respond to the pandemic. In this study, counselling COVID-19 patients was positively associated with higher resilience scores. This finding suggests that providing services to COVID-19 patients decreases fear and enhances the sense of service for care professionals. It has been suggested that individuals who are able to help at times of crisis are usually better able to cope and overcome negative feelings [31] . A study describing the experiences of healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic revealed that a sense of responsibility to reduce patients' suffering and safeguard the country was pervasive throughout their stories [32] . This sense of responsibility has been proved to act as a powerful catalyst for building resilience [33] .",

            "text": "Analysis of study findings showed that hospital employment, having a condition preventing face-to-face counselling, considering quitting job and being neutral or dissatisfied with appreciation received during the pandemic were negatively associated with resilience scores. Working in a hospital (especially in the absence of adequate access to PPE), and having a chronic condition increase the risk of developing serious and severe symptoms if COVID-19 is contracted and is thus negatively associated with resilience. Customized support programs need to be offered to dieticians with chronic conditions and for those working in hospitals to enhance their resilience. Providing support programs falls under the purview of both the institution and the government. Health institutions have a role in ensuring the availability of essential facilities to ease dieticians' workload during these difficult times. Such facilities include installing an efficient, user friendly, and secure information technology infrastructure to ensure easy access for relevant databases and information from remote locations [34] . Moreover, institutions should incorporate policies and strategies to promote flexible practices that enable dieticians to juggle between their work and family responsibilities, thereby decreasing the psychological stress and enhancing resilience [34] . Likewise, the government has a role in reducing the pressure on dieticians along with other healthcare professionals, through providing PPE, reducing the workload intensity of dieticians, adopting strict infection control measures, and offering practical guidance [35] . Based on previous studies, these measures helped protect the mental health of healthcare professionals during previous outbreaks [34, 35] . Finally, and as per the results of previous studies, resilience was negatively associated with intention to quit [34, 36] and with absence of adequate support [34] . These findings reinforce the importance of extending adequate and customized support to dieticians during the pandemic. Such support would not only enhance the resilience of dieticians, but would also improve their retention [34] .",

While this finding may not be in line with previous research, it arguable that during the COVID-19 pandemic, demographic factors such age and sex, have less of an effect on resilience while other factors more directly linked to the pandemic exert a significant influence on resilience. In fact, the results of this study showed significant associations among many COVID-19-related characteristics and the resilience of dieticians, such as 'presence of any condition that prevents you from face-to-face counseling' , 'the efficiency of dietetic counseling after COVID-19 pandemic compared to before COVID-19 pandemic' , and 'Have you counseled COVID-19 patients' .",

First, the absence of a national registry of dieticians in the country could have limited the reach of subjects' recruitment. That said, the sample size as well as the diverse age ranges, educational levels and place of practice of participants supports the representativeness and generalizability of the results. Second, the COVID-19 lockdown and restrictions imposed in the UAE during data collection imposed the online nature of the data collection in this study. Though this method of data collection method eliminates potential interviewer bias and social desirability bias, it is possible that participants may have misread or misunderstood certain questions. Third, our sample is skewed towards younger age. Although, there is no comprehensive registry of dieticians in the UAE in order to compare its age distribution with our sample, the overall population age distribution of the UAE is generally skewed towards a younger age. In 2020, the forecasted largest age group in the UAE was those between 30 and 34 years, at around 1.8 million. The second largest age group in the country was between 25 and 29 years. [37] . Lastly, as this study was conducted using a cross-sectional design, the results could not imply any cause-effect relationship as reverse causality remains a possibility.",

The findings showed that, despite counseling COVID-19 patients, considerable proportions of dieticians indicated a high level of concern for one's safety, were not satisfied with the institutional support or were not appreciated during their practice. In line with these findings, the results of this study showed that 25% of dieticians are considering quitting their jobs. Such results were observed despite the fairly good overall resilience levels of the dieticians found in this study, which were mainly driven by a high level of spirituality and personal competence. Improving trust in one's instinct, tolerance of negative effects as well as maintaining work-life balance were areas of improvement identified in this study. Taken together, the findings of this study call for concerted efforts to ensure safe practice conditions for dieticians during the pandemic, including but not limited to, providing self-protecting equipment and training on digital health to allow remote counseling for patients. In addition, the findings highlight an opportunity for policy and decision makers to support the dieticians' workforce by offering stress relief programs (such as leisure activities and training on psychological skills to deal with multiple stressors) to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic.",
