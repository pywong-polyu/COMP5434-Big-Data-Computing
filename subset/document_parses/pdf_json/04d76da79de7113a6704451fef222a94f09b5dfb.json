Flow cytometry, a leading technology in cellular analysis, has been used broadly in the drug development process for over 20 years. In drug discovery, it is used for target identification, to characterize target biology and disease pathways and lead compound characterization and early mechanism of action evaluation (1) . It is used preclinically for proof of concept studies, preliminary safety evaluation, and first-in-human dose selection. For chimeric antigen receptor T cell (CAR-T) therapy and other cell-based therapies, flow cytometry is now being used in the manufacturing phases in order to evaluate product quality (purity, viability, and concentration) and post-infusion in order to monitor cellular kinetics (2, 3) . Receptor occupancy (RO) assays have become critical measurements in the development of protein-based therapies including bi-specific compounds targeting cell surface receptors such as immune-checkpoint inhibitors (4) (5) (6) . RO data are often used in pharmacokinetics/ pharmacodynamic modeling in order to guide first-in-human dosing ranges (4) (5) (6) . Nonetheless, the most frequent application of flow cytometry in drug development is likely in the clinical development phase where flow cytometry is used to monitor the cellular composition of the immune system for patient selection, to evaluate the efficacy of cell-depleting therapies and vaccine efficacy, and to assess measurable residual disease in leukemia, along with other numerous applications (7) .",

In a drug development setting, increased dimensionality enables a deeper understanding of the impact of novel therapies on the immune system and the targeted disease and from a logistics standpoint, it also increases the efficiency of sample usage which can be very important in clinical trials where minimizing the specimen collection volume per patient visit is critical.",

Fortunately, there are automated solutions to address these issues. Unsupervised or hypothesis-generating data analysis approaches are valuable to identify cell subsets which were not previously considered and to reveal associations between cell types, between diseased and healthy populations, or between treatment groups, which may not have been included in the initial hypothesis.",

A major development arrived in the 1950s with the Coulter Counter developed by Wallace & Joseph Coulter. This instrument consisted of two chambers containing liquid streams separated by a microchannel. As particles move through the microchannel, they displace an equivalent volume of liquid which is detected as a voltage pulse whose height is proportional to the cell number. In the early 1960s while working at IBM's Watson Laboratory at Columbia University, Kamentsky et al. developed the Rapid Cell Spectrophotometer, which using an arc lamp as a light source could measure cell size and nucleic acid content (8) . In 1965, Fulwyler introduced the Los Alamos Flow Microfluorometer, a forerunner of modern flow cytometers based on electronic cell volume and electrostatic deflection for segregation and sorting (9) .",

Next, in the early 1970s, the cytograph/ cytofluorograph and the PAS-8000 flow cytometers appeared, and in 1976, Herzenberg et al. at Stanford University designed the first cell sorter (11) . Fluorescence-based cytometry initially had numerous names including \"impulszytophotometrie\" which translates from German to \"pulse cytophotometry\" in English.

These fluorescent signals as well as scattered lighter signals were recorded.

With the introduction of solid-state lasers, benchtop instruments equipped with a single, fixed laser and fixed filters capable of three-color analysis became available in the late 1980s. Sorting was not possible with these instruments, but they were less expensive and could be used directly by research scientists without the need for dedicated operators. As a result of the decreased cost and ease of use, the benchtop flow cytometers became used more broadly and many laboratories purchased their own instruments outside of the core facilities.",

This class of assay became a critical component in the development of antiviral therapies for HIV/AIDS as the CD4 cell absolute count measurement was a key drug efficacy indicator and a required measurement in the care and treatment of patients receiving these compounds. Additionally, the use of CD45 and SSC to identify cellular populations in blood and bone marrow provided the foundation for characterizing normal and aberrant hematopoiesis, giving rise to the utility of cytometry in diagnosing and monitoring leukemia and lymphomas in clinical laboratories (14) . When six-color instruments became available, the assay for the detection of the major lymphocyte subsets (total T cells, CD4 and CD8 T cells, B cells, and NK cells) was reduced from a two-tube assay to a single-tube assay which allowed for greater efficiency and still more accurate measurements.",

It should be noted that while the introduction of the yellow-green laser did not necessarily (depending on the instrument) increase the total number of lasers on the instrument or result in greater number of detected parameters, it facilitated the generation of stronger, cleaner signal detection and thus is considered a major advance. This point is something to be aware of when evaluating newer instruments. For example, the 18-color instruments available today can be custom configured with up to 5 lasers and are equipped with digital detection systems which capture a greater amount of the emission signal, thus increasing sensitivity of the measurement (Table I) . As a result, these instruments not only have high dimensionality, but they are also more sensitive as a greater portion of the fluorescence emission can now be captured.",

            "text": "The first solution to the impasse of moving beyond 18color detection towards higher-dimensional analysis arrived in 2009 with mass cytometry or cytometric time-of-flight (CyTOF\u00ae) instruments that combine aspects of both flow cytometry and mass spectrometry (20, 22, 23) (Figure 4 ). Mass cytometry makes use of heavy metal isotope probes rather than fluorescent probes. An antibody tagged with a specific metal-element binds to a cellular antigen. Then, the metal-tagged cells are quantified in an inductively coupled plasma (ICP) mass spectrometry detection system, i.e., the metal-tagged cells are nebulized into single-cell droplets and introduced into the ICP (24, 25) ( Figure 4 ). The resulting charged atomic ion clouds from cellular components are transferred into the high vacuum of the mass spectrometer along with ions from the argon plasma. To resolve the specific probe ions, the mass cytometer is configured with quadrupole-time-of-flight (qTOF) which acts as a filter and allows only the heavier elemental ions consisting primarily of the masses of the metal-tagged probes, to be quantitated by TOF mass analysis and counted in discrete, time-separated detector channels ( Figure 4 ). The intensity of the signal detected results from the number of specific probe-derived ions striking the detector and is proportional to the amount of probe bound to the target ( Figure 4 ). The CyTOF provides at least three orders of magnitude of resolution between adjacent detection channels, greatly reducing the need for fluorescence spectral overlap compensation and its associated challenges (26, 27) . Mass cytometry allows for profiling about 40-50 parameters on a single cell. The relative ease of designing highparameter panels is an advantage of mass cytometry. However, low throughput efficiency and lower sensitivity of dimly expressed antigens have been identified as current limitations with the existing instruments. Thus, assays where a large number of events and longer acquisition collection times are required, such as rare event detection, may not be feasible using mass cytometry (28) . In addition, these instruments have a large footprint and require facility considerations associated with argon gas storage in high volume labs.",

            "text": "In spectral cytometers, collected light signals from individual fluorophores are separated by spectral unmixing rather than compensation/spectral overlap subtraction (12) . This results in better conservation of signal resolution compared to compensation, easing some of the challenges cytometrists have encountered while optimizing compensation matrices for high-parameter flow cytometry panels (7, 19) . In addition, most spectral cytometers can treat autofluorescence as a parameter and thus can extract it from fluorescent signal, further enhancing signal resolution (7). This may significantly reduce the background, particularly when analyzing highly autoflorescent cell lines and certain tissues such as the brain (35) . An additional advantage of spectral flow cytometry is it follows a similar workflow to conventional flow cytometry, using the same reagents and similar sample staining procedures.",

Several independent factors influence the background of a fluorescent probe, and one is its autofluorescence in the same channel detector as the cells. Other contributors to background include signal spillover into other detectors as well as the ability to be excited by more than one laser. New probes continue to appear on the market; some were created with novel chemistries such as Phiton\u2122 technology, and others were created with modifications of existing chemistries. Advantages of the new probes include additional choices of emission spectra (i.e., more colors), increased signal strength, and decreased background contributions. Depending on the context, there may be independent value to having different spectral overlaps compared to having improved signal-to-noise ratios.

The advantages of this category of probes are that they deliver consistent, discreet excitation profiles, are relatively stable, and are easy to conjugate to antibodies. In addition, organic dyes are soluble and thus less susceptible to aggregation and precipitation. They are not sensitive to organic solvents; this property along with their small size makes them well-suited for intracellular and intranuclear staining as well as phospho-flow applications. Texas Red which is susceptible to hydrolysis has largely been replaced by molecules with similar spectral properties but better solubility and photostability properties. Despite its continued wide usage, FITC is known to be pH sensitive and has a high rate of photobleaching and a broad emission spectrum. Other disadvantages of the initial organic dyes are that the difference between excitation wavelength and emission wavelength, named the Stokes shift, is small (50-100 nm); thus, the signals are not among the brightest.

This process is known as F\u00f6rster or fluorescence, resonance energy transfer (FRET). The development of tandem dye technology was a major advancement in flow cytometry as it expanded the pool of available options which could be used with existing lasers and detectors (Table I) . For this reason, tandem dyes were quickly adopted and continue to be broadly used. The first available tandem dyes were composed of a large protein donor, such as PE or APC, attached to a small molecule (cyanine) acceptor (e.g., PE-Cy7, PE-Cy5.5, APC-Cy5.5, and APC-Cy7). More recently, tandem dyes are being generated with the newer dyes being used as donor such as synthetic organic polymers or acceptor molecules such as eFluors\u00ae. The tandems with synthetic organic polymers do not require the emission of the donor to overlap with the excitation of the acceptor which allows for tandem with high Stokes shifts, emitting as far out as 785 nm with a 405-nm excitation. Advantages of tandem dyes include their brightness, with large Stokes's shift values (150-300 nm). The major disadvantages of tandem dyes include lot-tolot variability and stability issues (72, 73) . Next-generation tandem products such as Fire\u2122 and Dazzle\u2122 from BioLegend reduce some of the issues associated with tandem dyes.",

QDs are further coated with polymers which facilitate the attachment of biomolecules such as proteins, monoclonal antibodies, oligonucleotides, or streptavidin. Unlike fluorescent probes, their emission is not measured in Stokes shifts; laser excitation results in the creation of excitons proportional to the size of the QD and to the wavelength of the emitted fluorescence. Varying the amounts of cadmium and selenium results in QDs which can emit energy in the form of light over a range of wavelengths generating very bright signals and offering the advantages photostability and long shelf life (77, 78) . The invention of QDs was instrumental in the progress of flow cytometry towards 18-color analysis. Disadvantages include their size preventing the diffusion through cell membranes (79, 80). Moreover, nonspecific protein adsorption to the QD particle surface may prevent QD-conjugated ligands from interacting with their respective cellular receptors further decreasing signal in the readouts (81) . Although QDs are optimally excited with UV or violet lasers, they can also be minimally excited by multiple lasers, thus leading to compensation challenges. Thus, these reagents have now largely been replaced with the polymer dyes.",

Introduced in 2012, polymers are as bright as phycobiliproteins and Qdots and are available in a wide range of emission wavelengths which, like organic dyes, retain discreet excitation profiles. Brilliant Violet\u2122 (BV421), the first dye available within this category, truly revolutionized multiparameter flow cytometry as it was the first bright dye which could be excited off the violet (405 nm) laser (82) . At the time of its release, most instruments including clinical instruments were already equipped with violet lasers; thus, BV421 increased panel design options for many users. Given that polymer dyes are only excited at specific wavelengths, there are no issues with multiple laser excitation. Other advantages include photostability and reliable conjugation to antibodies. Currently, there are numerous subcategories of commercially available polymer dyes such as multiple Brilliant Violet\u2122 (BV), Brilliant\u2122 Ultraviolet (BUV), and Brilliant\u2122 Blue (BB) and Super Bright dyes from eBioscience.

With the commercialization and clinical adoption of flow cytometry, instrument vendors integrated software into the computer workstations which allowed users to use the tools to automate daily quality control processes, visualize data in histograms or bivariate plots, and obtain various statistical outputs such as population frequency and fluorescence intensity values. By the 1990s, 3rd party software packages became available such as FlowJo and FCS Express. The availability of independent analysis software gave the user more flexible and sophisticated data analysis tools.

These approaches fall into three categories: (1) supervised, (2) unsupervised, and (3) mixed machine learning. Supervised algorithms, such as flowDensity, flowLearn, and OpenCyto, are designed to recapitulate manual, predefined gating of known cell populations and markers. The advantages of these approaches include reducing subjectivity in gate placement resulting in lower variability and decreased time for gating and improved overall efficiency, yet still closely following the principles of manual gating, which remains the gold standard for gating of cytometry data. Unsupervised algorithms largely fall into 2 categories: (1) dimensionality reduction and (2) clustering algorithms. Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Tdistributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (tSNE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (uMAPS) are among the tools currently being used with highdimensional flow cytometry data sets for mapping and visualization of data into a 2D space. Clustering algorithms that group the cells together based on similarities such Phenograph and FlowSOM are also widely used. Unsupervised approaches can potentially reveal multidimensional relationships between cells not observed by prescribed gating strategies. Machine learning is a broader approach that utilizes a combination of algorithm-based tools to fin signals at cellular level in large datasets and identify biomarkers of disease severity, progression, or clinical response to therapeutic interventions. Computational approaches have also provided tools to improve the preprocessing steps of analysis such as sample quality assessment, normalization, and transformation (91) . Many of the algorithms have been reviewed in recent publications to compare performance and speed across a wide variety of patient samples in immune, infectious, and oncology disease areas (92) (93) (94) (95) (96) . More recently, computational multi-omics approaches have elucidated immune heterogeneity in COVID-19 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus (97) .

These technologies combine proteomics and transcriptomics at the single-cell level with next-generation sequencing (NGS) in order to provide a high resolution of cellular differences. The cells are labeled with antibodyoligonucleotide conjugates or antibody-derived tags (ADTs) ( Figure 6 ). DNA-barcoded antibodies convert the detection of proteins into quantitative, sequenceable readouts. A potentially limitless number of markers could be used for immunophenotyping and unbiased transcriptome analysis given that the issues related to spectral overlap or isotopes availability are not relevant.",

The RT primers are anchored to the bead and are made up several components including an oligo dT to prime the RT, a unique molecular identifier (UMI) to uniquely tag each molecule, and a barcode unique to each bead to distinguish one cell from all other cells. Next, the cells are lysed, allowing the mRNA molecules and the antibody oligos to hybridize to the RT primers by their poly A tails ( Figure 6 ). The cDNA is then synthesized from both ADTs and cellular mRNAs. The cDNAs are amplified, purified, and finally pooled for sequencing in one scRNA-seq run using existing methods such as 10x Genomics, Drop-seq, and ddSeq (101).",

Recommendations and latest developments can be found on the developer's website https://citeseq.com/computational-tools/. This technology, first described in 2017, is rapidly evolving and now includes the ability to multiplex samples through a process coined \"Cell Hashing\" and the ability to detect intracellular proteins.

The new probes display a variety of features such as increased signal to noise characteristics, greater stability, and resistance to environmental fluctuations. The availability of more wavelength choices for solid-state lasers combined with the ability to include a greater number of lasers on the instruments has broadened the available wavelengths for excitation and opened up the possibility of using newer fluorophores while decreasing some of the existing compensation issues. An equally important but perhaps less obvious contributor to increased dimensionality is the quality of the signals generated. The newer instruments are not only capable of collecting signals from a greater number and more diverse array of probes, but they are also able to capture a greater portion of the fluorescent signals. This functionality originally introduced in the digital instruments has matured in its presentation in the spectral instruments and other higherdimensional instruments.",

In addition, their implementation in drug development is providing a deeper and truer understanding of the impact of novel therapeutic interventions. However, given the aggressive timelines during drug development and the likely necessity of quickly addressing the next global pandemic, significant challenges remain before greater than 30-parameter analysis become routine practice in drug development and in particular, in clinical trials. Not only are additional fluorophores needed, there is also a critical need to decrease the assay development and data analysis timelines for high-content assays. These requirements could be satisfied with integrated automation solutions, better tools for panel design, and improved data analysis software packages (106) . As discussed above, data analysis has been identified as a rate-limiting step in cytometry and major contributor to data variability. Not only are new data analysis tools needed, but a pathway to implement them in regulated environments is critical. Too often a lack of clarity from regulators regarding implementation of new software packages impedes their implementation (107) . Additional requirements for successful adoption of these new higher-content solutions to single-cell analysis in the context of multicenter clinical trials include more robust strategies for instrument setup and cross-instrument standardization procedures.",
