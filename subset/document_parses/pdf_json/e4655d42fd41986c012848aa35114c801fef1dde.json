Pregnant women are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 and have a 70% higher infection rate than agematched adults [1] . Between January 22, 2020 and December 6, 2021, a total of 150,036 pregnant women were confirmed with COVID-19 infections in the United States (US) alone. A PCR positivity rate of 15.4% with SARS-CoV-2 was reported in women presenting in labor in New York City, regardless of symptoms [2] . Pregnant women with COVID-19 typically experience mild illness, and their births are often uncomplicated [3] . However, there have been reports of pregnancy complications like pre-eclampsia, preterm birth, intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), and stillbirth, as well as serious maternal illness which required intensive care, and even maternal death [4] . The recent Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report on November 19, 2021 indicated that a COVID-19 diagnosis during the delivery hospitalization was associated with an increased risk for stillbirth in the US, with a stronger association when the Delta variant was predominant [5] .",

A cytokine storm at the placenta may trigger placental malperfusion and even abruption, and the intravasal coagulation at the utero-placental level can cause IUFD. The human placenta expresses receptors of SARS-CoV-2 and proteases that trigger viral fusion [10] . Pregnant women infected with SARS-CoV-2 during the first and third trimesters may have higher risks of inducing exaggerated responses causing a cytokine storm [11] . In the third trimester IUFD present in this study, our data suggests that the excessive infiltration of immune cells and cytokine storm at the placenta due to the Delta variant caused severe placental inflammation and damage, which likely resulted in placental abruption and the demise of the fetus. The limitation of our study is that we did not have access to control placental tissue from a A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t gestational age-matched pregnant individual with gestational diabetes, but no SARS-CoV-2 infection for comparison of the pathological and cytokine expression levels. Thus, our comparison was to a normal placenta. However, a previous study reported no significant differences in the expression of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-8, and several other genes of interest in the placentas of women with gestational diabetes mellitus relative to those of healthy pregnant women [12] , whereas we found TNF-\u03b1 and IL-8 were significantly elevated in our COVID-19 patient.",

The presence of SARS-CoV-2 infection in placenta has also been reported in COVID-19 patients [3] . Among these cases of placental infections, one mother experienced a complicated second trimester pregnancy with preeclampsia and placental abruption, one had mild COVID-19 symptoms with a normal, healthy birth, and one experienced moderate symptoms while the neonate also contracted COVID-19 and suffered from neurological manifestations. However, IUFD associated with maternal SARS-CoV-2 infections have been generally rare, and all of these cases were associated with severe maternal complications [15] [16] [17] . The maternal characteristics and symptoms included overweight or obese individuals experiencing mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms. Additionally, different extents of placental inflammation were reported, such as inflammation and fibrin deposition in and between the villi [15] , chorionitis, infarction, and necrosis of the placental parenchyma [16] and mixed inflammatory infiltrates in the subchorial space [17] . There is also evidence of minimal to no placental changes in some diabetic women compared to control groups [18] .",

However, among pregnant women, there is only 24% vaccine coverage of individuals with at least 1 dose in the US as of November 27, 2021. The rise of the Delta variant coupled with high vaccine hesitancy in pregnant women raises public health concerns regarding the potential for greater disease severity and worse outcomes, as observed in the unvaccinated patient discussed in this case. Evidence shows that the COVID-19 vaccine has high levels of effectiveness against symptomatic disease with the Delta variant after full vaccination [6, 24] .Thus, vaccination should continue to be strongly advocated and will likely continue to reduce SARS-CoV-2 infection risks for pregnant women and their fetuses.

Viral RNA from the placenta was COVID-19 positive.The virus was determined to be a Delta variant by sequencing, with the spike genetic mutation signature including T19R, R158G, L452R, T478K, D614G, P681R, and D950N, and deletions at positions 156 and 157 compared with the prototype pandemic Wuhan strain. Currently, two Delta variants (Delta-142G and Delta-142D), are co-circulating in the United States, and this patient was infected with Delta-142D, which has been predominant in Missouri since May 2021. Pathological analysis of the placenta was performed. The umbilical cord was slightly twisted and torn near the insertion site. There was no sign of maternal vascular malperfusion, viral inclusions, erythroblastosis, villous edema, suspicious lesions on the placental disk, membrane inflammation, or umbilical cord phlebitis or arteritis. However, pathology confirmed intervillous inflammation composed of neutrophils and monocytes. The placenta showed villi with rims of fibrin, areas of degeneration, and loss of syncytiotrophoblastic layers. Syncytiotrophoblastic knots and stromal vascular karyorrhexis was seen (Figure 1A). This was observed in all examined sections, indicating diffuse involvement. To understand the association of SARS-CoV-2 infection with IUFD, IHC and qPCR were performed to confirm antigen presentation and expression of inflammatory mediators in the placenta was measured. Extensive SARS-CoV-2 antigen was identified throughout the placental disc in villous cytotrophoblasts and throughout the cytoplasm of syncytiotrophoblasts (Figure 1B). Additionally, abundant SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected. Thus, we interpret this case as a Delta variant inducing an acute inflammatory response. Gene expression level of proinflammatory markers associated with viral infection in the placenta were quantified. Compared with those markers in the placenta from a healthy woman, 9 of 13 dramatically increased from COVID-19 infection including tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 with an increase of 199.60 [\u00b129.02, standard deviation; p=0.0329]-fold, interferon gammainduced protein 10 (IP-10) (80.38\u00b127.21; p<0.0001), interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 (54.97\u00b12.33; p<0.0001), markers stimulated by the Delta variant were associated with the trophoblastic necrosis and lesions crossing the placenta, which ultimately led to placental abruption. Neutralizing antibody titers typically peak around 60 days after illness onset of mild COVID-19 infections [9]. Neutralizing antibody titers against both Delta variants from the patient's sera 2months after disease onset were quantified. Results showed that the patient had homologous geometric mean titers of 320.00\u00b10.00 against Delta-142D and heterologous geometric mean titers of 201.59\u00b175.42 against Delta-142G. In comparison, the neutralizing titers against the early US variant (WA1) were still present but considerably less, with titers of 50.40\u00b118.86. The high neutralizing antibody level of the patient indicated stimulation of the immune response against SARS-CoV-2, suggesting that the patient was not immunocomprised and demonstrated a proinflammatory response to the pathogen.",
