Lupus anticoagulants (LAs), autoantibodies directed against phospholipids or protein-phospholipid complexes, manifest clinically with an increased risk of thrombosis. While these autoantibodies are uncommon, the distinctive clinical presentation in conjunction with the typical laboratory findings often enable straightforward identification of the underlying autoantibody. However, the presence of a concomitant acquired FVIII inhibitor and LA is exceedingly rare with fewer than 20 documented cases. All prior patients presented with life-threatening hemorrhage, thrombosis, or both, prompting comprehensive hematologic evaluation and subsequent identification of the pathologic antibodies. We describe a novel case of a patient with no signs of hemorrhage or thrombosis who was incidentally found to have both a FVIII inhibitor and LA during evaluation of a prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT). This finding resulted in FVIII inhibitor-directed management, including immunosuppressive therapy. The unique presentation of an incidental FVIII inhibitor and LA in an asymptomatic patient without thrombotic or bleeding complications highlights the potential challenge in elucidating the etiology of a prolonged PTT, as LAs and FVIII inhibitors both prolong the PTT, and each entity can interfere with assays designed to detect the presence of the other autoantibody. This case underscores the importance of recognizing that patients with major underlying disturbances in their hematologic physiology, but in whom clinical symptoms have yet to manifest, may potentially be overlooked until such symptoms are evident.",

Acquired hemophilia A is a rare bleeding disorder caused by autoantibodies that bind to and neutralize the activity of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). Individuals with FVIII inhibitors almost universally present with a bleeding diathesis, frequently to an extent that is life-threatening [1] . In contrast to the hemorrhagic features of FVIII inhibitors, lupus anticoagulants (LAs) are autoantibodies directed against phospholipids or protein-phospholipid complexes, which manifest clinically with an increased risk of thrombosis or fetal loss [2] . While these autoantibodies are uncommon, the distinct clinical presentation in conjunction with the typical laboratory findings often enable straightforward identification of the underlying autoantibody. However, the presence of a concomitant acquired FVIII inhibitor and LA is exceedingly rare with fewer than 20 documented cases (Table 1) . Although the true prevalence of concurrent FVIII inhibitors and lupus anticoagulants is unknown, to date all previously described patients presented with life-threatening hemorrhage (11/16 patients), thrombosis (2/16 patients), or both (3/16 patients), prompting comprehensive hematologic evaluation and subsequent identification of the pathologic antibodies. We were unable to identify any prior report of incidental discovery of the co-occurrence of these autoantibodies.

She denied any history of autoimmune disorders or recent infections, including COVID-19. A complete metabolic panel and complete blood count were unremarkable. Coagulation studies included a PTT mixing study that did not correct (32.1 s at 0 min, 37.3 s following incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min). LA testing demonstrated an abnormal silica clotting time (SCT) (ratio 1.28, reference: < 1.20) and an abnormal dilute Russell viper venom time (dRVVT) (ratio 1.23, reference: < 1.20). Anticardiolipin IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies and anti\u03b2 2 -glycoprotein IgM, IgG, and IgA antibodies were not elevated. The prolonged PTT, abnormal mixing study, and abnormal SCT and dRVVT were all consistent with the presence of a LA. However, due to the abnormal PTT mixing study with near-correction at 0 min and re-prolongation at 60 min, combined with the weak LA positivity, further testing was performed to assess for an additional coagulation factor deficiency and/or presence of a factor inhibitor.",

A LA can interfere with PTT-based factor activity assays, resulting in a falsely decreased FVIII activity level and an erroneous diagnosis of congenital or acquired hemophilia A [18] . FVIII inhibitors, although less common than LAs, may lead to false positive results for LAs, particularly using the SCT, leading to a misdiagnosis of antiphospholipid antibody syndrome [18] . To differentiate between these two groups of autoantibodies, chromogenic FVIII activity testing and the dRVVT are valuable, as neither are affected by the presence of the other autoantibody [18] . Additionally, LAs frequently function as immediate inhibitors with no correction at 0 min in the PTT mixing study, while FVIII autoantibodies typically display time-and temperature-dependent inhibition [18] .",

In practice, the indication for further laboratory testing to identify an inhibitor or factor deficiency is driven by compatible clinical findings, such as the presence of a significant bleeding disorder (e.g., coagulation factor deficiencies or inhibitors) or thrombosis (e.g., antiphospholipid antibodies). However, this patient's asymptomatic presentation necessitated specialized coagulation testing and result interpretation based on the knowledge and experience that the presence of multiple inhibitors is possible. Oftentimes, patients with laboratory abnormalities, such as a prolonged PT or PTT, are evaluated only if they endorse symptoms.

The identification of a prolonged PTT and abnormal mixing study with partial correction, albeit not to the normal range, may lead providers to prematurely conclude that the patient had an isolated LA. Had evaluation concluded with detection of the LA, the patient would not have received appropriate management of a FVIII inhibitor, and at most would have undergone repeat LA testing > 12 weeks later. However, the astute recognition that a weak LA did not entirely explain the partial PTT correction with mixing at 0 min and prolongation at 60 min subsequently resulted in the identification . 1) , the FVIII inhibitor might have been undetected, possibly resulting in significant morbidity or mortality. Hemorrhage in patients with acquired hemophilia A is exceptionally common (> 90% of patients present with bleeding), and often severe (approximately 70% of patients develop severe hemorrhage) [19] . In addition to the significant risk of hemorrhage associated with FVIII inhibitors, the risk of thrombosis was also significant in our patient with a LA, as evidence demonstrates that patients with LAs have a thrombosis odds ratio 5-16 times greater than persons without LAs [20] . The detection of the FVIII inhibitor enabled the initiation of appropriate therapy. Acquired FVIII inhibitor therapy has two primary goals: to alleviate clinically relevant bleeding and to eliminate the FVIII inhibitor and mitigate the risk of hemorrhage [21] . Treatment options for achieving hemostasis in patients with FVIII inhibitors include recombinant activated factor VII and activated prothrombin complex concentrate [21] . To eliminate the autoantibody, current guidelines for immunosuppressive therapy suggest corticosteroids alone for patients with FVIII \u2265 1% and an inhibitor titer \u2264 20 BU [21] . If no response is seen after 3-4 weeks, cyclophosphamide or rituximab should be added. For patients with FVIII < 1% or inhibitor titer > 20 BU, corticosteroids in combination with cyclophosphamide or rituximab is recommended [21] .",
