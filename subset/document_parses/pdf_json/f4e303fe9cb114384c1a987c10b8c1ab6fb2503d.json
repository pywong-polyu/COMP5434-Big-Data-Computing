            "text": "Purpose: This research examines the emerging role of respiratory oscillometry associated with integer (InOr) and fractional order (FrOr) respiratory models in the context of groups of patients with increasing severity. The contributions to our understanding of the respiratory abnormalities along the course of increasing COPD severity and the diagnostic use of this method were also evaluated. Patients and Methods: Forty-five individuals with no history of smoking or pulmonary diseases (control group) and 141 individuals with diagnoses of COPD were studied, being classified into 45 mild, 42 moderate, 36 severe and 18 very severe cases. Results: This study has shown initially that the course of increasing COPD severity was adequately described by the model parameters. This resulted in significant and consistent correlations among these parameters and spirometric indexes. Additionally, this evaluation enhanced our understanding of the respiratory abnormalities in different COPD stages. The diagnostic accuracy analyses provided evidence that hysteresivity, obtained from FrOr modeling, allowed a highly accurate identification in patients with mild changes [area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC)= 0.902]. Similar analyses in groups of moderate and severe patients showed that peripheral resistance, derived from InOr modeling, provided the most accurate parameter (AUC=0.898 and 0.998, respectively), while in very severe patients, traditional, InOr and FrOr parameters were able to reach high diagnostic accuracy (AUC>0.9). Conclusion: InOr and FrOr modeling improved our knowledge of the respiratory abnormalities along the course of increasing COPD severity. In addition, the present study provides evidence that these models may contribute in the diagnosis of COPD. Respiratory oscillometry exams require only tidal breathing and are easy to perform. Taken together, these practical considerations and the results of the present study suggest that respiratory oscillometry associated with InOr and FrOr models may help to improve lung function tests in COPD.",

            "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is one of the main causes of morbidity and mortality worldwide. It is responsible for a major public health issue in the 21st century, resulting in an increasing economic and social burden. It is currently the fourth and will soon become the third most frequent cause of death, accounting for 6% of all deaths in the world. 1,2 COPD is defined as a chronic respiratory condition that is characterized by a persistent progressive limitation of airflow associated with an inflammatory response in the airways and lung, responsive to harmful particles or gases. 2, 3 Airflow limitation, which is characteristic of the disease, is basically caused by four major mechanisms: loss of elasticity; alveolar destruction as a result of emphysema; decrease in airway calibers; and obstruction of small airways with secretion, a result of chronic bronchitis. 4 Airflow limitation is usually diagnosed by spirometry, an exam performed to classify and grade the severity of the disease. The diagnosis occurs from the ratio of volume expired in the first second/forced vital capacity (FEV 1 / FVC) after bronchodilator (BD) <0.70, and its classification in stages is based on the parameter of volume expired in the first second (FEV 1 ). 2, 4, 5 Despite being considered the gold standard, spirometry requires high cooperation on the part of the volunteers, and great effort in the execution of the expiratory maneuver. These factors become a major disadvantage, since this procedure can temporarily cause several changes in bronchomotor tone, which can result in variation in the quality of the final exam results. 6, 7 The forced oscillation technique (FOT), also known as respiratory oscillometry, consists of a non-invasive method, which aims to assess the resistance and reactance of the respiratory system during spontaneous ventilation. The method is based on the application of sinusoidal pressure variations in the opening of the airway through a mouthpiece during spontaneous ventilation. The exam is simple to perform, requiring a short time to be performed and little collaboration from patients. 8, 9 This method has reached a high level of sophistication, currently representing the state of the art in terms of assessing lung function. It has been successfully applied in our laboratory and in several other research groups to diagnose changes in respiratory mechanics associated with various diseases. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] The extended RIC model (eRIC) has been suggested as a model that shows improvements compared to the basic RIC model. In these models, R is the central airway resistance analog, Rp describes peripheral resistance, and I and C are associated with pulmonary inertia and compliance, respectively. The eRIC model can also be used to assess total resistance (Rt = R + Rp). 19 Fractional-order models (FrOr) in combination with respiratory oscillometry have recently been proposed, allowing a more detailed and accurate description of the dynamic behavior of the respiratory system. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] These models help to obtain a new view on the mechanisms associated with peripheral changes in the diseased lung. 25 They can provide information associated with resistive properties and hysteresis, which reflects the increase in heterogeneity and changes in lung structure. Information is also provided on the damping factor, associated with parenchymal deformity and elastance. 18, 25 A previous study by our group showed that these parameters are adequate to describe the initial effects of COPD, observed in individuals with mild disease. 18 However, there are no studies in the literature evaluating the description of the effects of COPD in advanced stages using these models. The contribution to the understanding of the pathophysiology of COPD and the diagnostic use of these models has not yet been investigated.",

This includes the resistance of the airways and tissue resistance originating from the lung and chest wall, along with the effect of gas redistribution (pendelluft). 29 S describes the resistance change with frequency and is related to respiratory system non-homogeneities, 30 while Rm is related with the mid-frequency range resistance, which is sensitive to the airway caliber, reflecting resistance in the central airways. 31 There is not a consensus in the literature concerning what are the best parameters to interpret respiratory impedance curves. To contribute to elucidate this question, other widely used respiratory resistance parameters were also analyzed: the resistances at 4 Hz (R4), 12 Hz (R12) and 20 Hz (R20), representing the low, mid and high-frequency spectra, respectively, and the frequency dependence of resistance, which was represented as the difference between R4 and R20 (R4-R20).",

These patients have an obstructive disorder, which confers a marked degree of oxidative stress, protease-antiprotease imbalance, inflammation and consequent reduction in body weight. 39 The heights of the groups studied are similar; this is the parameter of greatest importance for the definition of impedance values. 27 The reductions observed in the spirometric parameters were consistent with the classification values for the severity of COPD. 2 The measurements of traditional respiratory oscillometry are described in Table 2 . Smooth muscle hypertrophy and bronchial wall fibrosis are factors that can contribute to increases in airway and tissue resistance. The increases observed in resistive parameters are associated with inflammation of the mucous glands due to high levels of tobacco consumption, which results in airway obstruction.- 40, 41 Similar results have been reported for silicosis. 11 S and R4-R20 reflects the heterogeneity of the respiratory system. 42 Recent studies have shown associations between resistance variations and the degree of morphologic abnormalities of small airways assessed with endobronchial optical coherence tomography in COPD and heavy smokers. 43 It should be noted that these parameters are also influenced by the shunt impedance from the upper airway, as well as by the tissue resistance. The changes observed indicate increasing heterogeneity of the respiratory system with the progression of the disease. Similar results were obtained in previous studies in Cystic Fibrosis 19 and Silicosis. 11 The more negative reactance (Xm) found in the patient groups reflects the reduction in homogeneity of the respiratory system and in dynamic compliance of the subjects under study. 3 Table 2 also showed a significant reduction in dynamic compliance (Cdin), which is related to the elastic properties of the respiratory system. This decrease may be associated with changes in lung tissue, chest wall, increased resistance and changes in airway distensibility. 31 Thus, the reduction in value between groups could be associated with the progressive increase in airway resistance and the reduction of apparent compliance of the respiratory system. 41 Similarly, the increase observed in Ax is related to the elastic properties of the respiratory system. It also reflects increases in the degree of obstruction of the peripheral 19 and the consequent reductions in apparent compliance.",

These changes are related to the worsening of ventilation homogeneity and reduced lung compliance. 41 There was a significant increase in Z4 in the sick groups. This parameter assesses the absolute value of the respiratory impedance, being associated with the work performed by the respiratory muscles to overcome the resistive and elastic loads, in order to promote airflow in the respiratory system. 12 The increase observed in Zrs is consistent with the clinical changes usually seen in COPD, which include increasing dyspnea with the evolution of the disease. Figure 4 describes the results of the eRIC model between the groups studied. R showed increases in all groups of patients studied when compared to the control group ( Figure 4A ). This increase is related to the presence of secretion in the central airways, typical of COPD, resulting in changes in the lung parenchyma. 2 These changes are also related to increased inflammation and decreased radial traction in the airways. 40 The most significant correlation of R with spirometric parameters was with FVC (Table 3) , which indicates that this parameter may reflect the presence of lower mobilized lung volumes. Rp is theoretically associated with peripheral airways. In agreement with this hypothesis, there was an inverse and significant correlation between Rp and descriptive spirometric parameters of peripheral obstruction ( Table 3 ). The increase in Rp observed in all stages of COPD ( Figure 4B) is associated with the fact that the effects of smoking start in the most peripheral airways, causing inflammation and narrowing of these airways, which causes an increase in resistance in this region. 19 Previous work by our group on asthma and asbestosis has shown similar results. 12, 25 Recently, there has been a re-emergence of the interest in the study of small airways from a pathophysiological viewpoint and even for clinical management. 44 The results presented in ( Figure 4B ) indicate that this methodology could be useful in identifying changes in this \"silent zone\".",

In the present study, I showed a significant reduction ( Figure 4D ). This can be explained by the concepts of choke points 45 and apparent inertance. 46 The oscillatory signal used by FOT to assess the impedance is prevented from passing through the choke points. It precludes FOT from considering the lung beyond the choke point so that the measured inertance reflects the airways that are proximal to the choke points. Thus, the increase in respiratory obstruction introduces a reduction in the apparent mass of the gas measured by the FOT, in the associated pressure necessary for the acceleration of the gas, and consequently, in the measured inertance. This proposition is consistent with the direct associations observed between inertance and spirometric indexes of central and peripheral airway obstruction (Table 3) .",

Table 3 shows a direct association of C and spirometric indexes of central and peripheral airway obstruction. These results are in line with this proposition. Considering the FrOr parameters, G showed a significant increase in the comparison between groups ( Figure 5A ). This result is consistent with the pathophysiology of COPD since, during the course of the disease, airway resistance increases due to increased secretion and changes in the lung parenchyma. 18, 48 In agreement with this interpretation, Table 4 shows that G presented significant correlations with all spirometric parameters, including those that describe peripheral airways, but mainly with the central airway descriptors (FEV1).",

The reduction observed in mild and moderate patients may be explained, at least in part, by a predominant effect of tissue destruction (emphysema) in these groups of patients. In these stages, lung volume increases resulting in air trapping. In more severe stages of the disease, with increased airflow limitation and air trapping, hyperinflation begins to occur. In the presence of hyperinflation, at higher pulmonary volumes, the interaction between the lung tissue and the chest wall results in an increased respiratory elastance. This increase in severe groups may also reflect heterogeneity, which can be explained by the increase in structural changes in the lungs. 25, 49 These changes are related with increased airway inflammation, destruction of the lung parenchyma and inhomogeneous ventilation. 25, 50 The inverse associations observed with FVC and the spirometric parameters related with respiratory obstruction (Table 4) are consistent with the aforementioned hypotheses.",

These correlations are similar to the results observed in previous studies. 3, [11] [12] [13] [14] 32, 41, 52 These results indicate that these models provide complementary data to spirometry. This confirms the importance of the models studied in order to provide additional information about the mechanical characteristics of the respiratory system. It is also important to remember the marked methodological differences between FOT and spirometry.

These results are consistent with the proposition that the lower airways are the most affected in patients with COPD, and that changes in them occur since the earliest stages of the disease.",

            "text": "Considering the parameters of the FrOr model, \u03b7 was the one that obtained the highest diagnostic accuracy in the identification of mild COPD, among all the parameters studied (Figures 8 and 9 ). This finding is in line with previous studies showing that \u03b7 was the more sensitive parameter in detecting an initial decline in lung function of adult patients with sickle cell anemia. 53 An explanatory theory for this finding may be proposed observing Figure 6 . The FrOr model presented the smallest errors in all of the groups under study. In the control group, this result reflects the ability of this model to characterize the positive frequency-dependence of the resistance observed experimentally in some healthy subjects. In patients, the underlying reason may be the ability of the FrOr models to adjust to fractional values of 20 dB/dec, in contrast with integer-order models, which are limited to integer multiples of 20 dB/dec. The evidence presented in Figures 8 and 9 supports the notion that FrOr models may be useful in more advanced COPD. Parameters from this model (\u03b7) presented adequate diagnostic accuracy in moderate patients and high accuracy (G) in groups of severe and very severe patients. These results are consistent with previous studies concerning the differentiation between malignant and benign breast lesions detected on X-ray screening mammography, 54 cancer detection, 55 screening for hemodialysis patients, 56 differentiation of low-and high-grade pediatric brain tumors, 57 and Parkinson's Disease severity assessment. 58 As expected, the diagnostic accuracy of the traditional, eRIC and FrOr parameters increased in more advanced stages of the COPD (Figure 9 ). Rp was the most accurate in groups of patients with moderate and severe disease. This finding probably describes the ability of this parameter to adequately encapsulate the main physiological changes observed in these two classes of patients. In very severe patients, traditional, eRIC and FrOr parameters presented similar high diagnostic accuracy.",

This resulted in significant and consistent correlations among these parameters and spirometric indexes. Additionally, this evaluation enhanced our understanding of the respiratory abnormalities in different COPD stages. The diagnostic accuracy analyses provided evidence that FrOr modeling (\u03b7) allowed a highly accurate identification in patients with mild changes. Similar analysis in groups of moderate and severe patients showed that eRIC modeling provided the most accurate parameter (Rp), while in very severe patients, traditional, eRIC and FrOr parameters were able to reach high diagnostic accuracy. These exams require only tidal breathing and are easy to perform.
