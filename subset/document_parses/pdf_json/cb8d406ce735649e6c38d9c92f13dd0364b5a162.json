In recent years, there has been an emphasis on making predictions and decisions based on the results of such learning, and the use of AI in the medical field has increased. It has been successful in building models for retrospectively identifying abnormalities in diverse types of images [2] . In particular, systems for detecting colorectal cancer, skin tumors, cerebral aneurysms, and influenza infection, among others, by AI-based imaging diagnosis have been consecutively developed. In rheumatology, many results related to treatment support have been reported. Studies have successfully predicted the response to treatment and the prognosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients using data on clinical markers and genetic analyses. In 2019, Kim et al. used transcriptome profiling of RA synovium to predict treatment responses from inflammatory signals [3] . Furthermore, Guan et al. used clinical data and single-nucleotide polymorphism sequence data to predict the patient response to antitumor necrosis factor therapy [4] . Subsequently, many prognostic predictors of the patient response to treatment and rehospitalization have been reported for RA, systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), juvenile idiopathic arthritis, spondyloarthropathy, and osteoarthritis.

Therefore, to facilitate the diagnosis of IgG4-RD, in this study, we attempted to determine whether AI could properly diagnose IgG4-RD using only physical examination and blood test data obtained at the first visit, which are available to general practitioners, without using images and pathological findings that require a diagnosis by specialists.",

As a result, the invasiveness to the patients is high, and the high cost of medical care has become a problem. Thus, this study investigated whether AI can be trained to differentiate IgG4-RD from other rheumatic diseases by learning the typical cases of both IgG4-RD and non-IgG4-RD, and whether proper diagnosis is possible.

In addition, 204 patients with other rheumatic disorders that needed to be differentiated from IgG4-RD who visited the aforementioned institutions between January 2019 and June 2019 were also included in the study. All subjects provided informed consent to participate in the study based on the information provided in the study. IgG4-RD was diagnosed based on the comprehensive diagnostic criteria for IgG4-RD (Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare Research Group, Japan, 2011) [6] . Among those who visited the aforementioned institutions before 2010, only those with a definitive diagnosis according to the comprehensive diagnostic criteria were included in this study. The differential diseases were as follows: Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome (SS; N=106), SLE (N=25), polymyositis/dermatomyositis (N=19), microscopic polyangiitis (N=6), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA; N=11), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (N=10), multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD; N=19), and sarcoidosis (N=8). In actual clinical practice, the differential diagnosis of IgG4-RD is very important. Hyper-IgG4emia is not specific to IgG4-RD as it is also detected in eosinophilic diseases, such as EGPA, eosinophilic pneumonia, some bronchial asthma, and MCD [7] . It is also necessary to differentiate IgG4-RD from other disorders, including SS in sicca symptoms, SS and sarcoidosis in lacrimal and salivary gland swelling, SLE in hypocomplementemia, and myositis and vasculitis in interstitial pneumonia. Depending on the diagnosis, the treatment and prognosis may vary greatly. However, because IgG4-RD is a rare disease, the differential diagnosis can be difficult. In this study, the diagnostic or classification criteria developed by the relevant societies and research groups were used [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

Ten percent of the patients and controls were randomly selected to be validation samples. Of the remaining cases, 80% and 20% were included as training and test samples, respectively [16] . This process was performed randomly by a computer for each of the IgG4-RD and non-IgG4-RD groups. Finally, validation was performed with the validation sample that was separated at the beginning. A prediction model was developed using the training sample with the outcome set to extract IgG4-RD cases from among the cases of diseases that needed to be differentiated from IgG4-RD. We also performed analyses for the situations with known and unknown serum IgG4 concentration, which are considered to be an important variable in the diagnosis of IgG4-RD. In the latter situation, we purposely excluded the IgG4 concentration from the analysis. Cases with missing data were excluded from the study. The value of missing data was 0.7%. R version 3.6.1 software (https:// cran. ism. ac. jp) was used for the analyses.

The algorithm of the decision tree depicts the characteristics of this disease very well; in IgG4-RD, more than 90% of the cases have hyper-IgG4emia [7, [20] [21] [22] , and the CRP level is often low. Yamada et al. reported that less than 10% of cases had a CRP level \u22651.0 mg/dL [23] . Furthermore, the absence of an elevated serum IgM level is considered to be important in differentiating MCD [24] . The most used nodes and branches in this study were diagnosed by CRP, IgM, and hyper-IgG4emia. On the other hand, in the Gini impurity in the random forest method, serum IgG4 was extracted as the most important variable, followed by the levels of serum IgA, IgM, and sIL-2R, and the age at the first visit. The cutoff values for the age at the first visit and serum IgA concentration in the Gini impurity are unknown due to the nature of the random forest method [25] , but IgG4-RD often occurs in the elderly [26] , and age is presumably used to differentiate IgG4-RD from MCD, as described above [24] .",

The algorithm of the decision tree showed that it is more complicated when the IgG4 value is unknown than when it is known. Even the most frequently used branch of the tree had five nodes: they were the age at the first visit, the concentrations of serum IgG, IgA, and IgM, and the peripheral leukocyte counts. In this tree, a new node was added: a peripheral white blood cell count <10,960 /\u03bcL. The peripheral white blood cell count has not been given much attention in the diagnosis of IgG4-RD until now. In the future, as a new perspective, it may be necessary to keep in mind that leukocytosis is not very common in IgG4-RD. In contrast, in the Gini impurity in the random forest method, in which the accuracy was restored, the age at the first visit was extracted as the most important variable. Regardless of whether the serum IgG4 level was known, the most important factors that were extracted were generally the same. In other words, in the random forest method, when the serum IgG4 level is known, it is the most important factor for diagnosis, and the age at the first visit and the levels of serum Ig and sIL-2R are also important variables, and when the serum IgG4 level is unknown, the age at the first visit and serological markers other than the serum IgG4 concentration are important for the diagnosis.",

When building a machine learning model, a large representative and diverse dataset should be collected. Since this study focused on the differential diagnosis of IgG4-RD, it was not adjusted to the frequency of the disease in actual clinical practice. In addition, all subjects were Japanese, and it is unclear whether our results can be extrapolated to other populations. Also, the test items used in this study included items that are not used in daily practice in Europe and the USA. In Japan, registries for intractable diseases are currently being constructed, and we hope to overcome these problems in the future using the databases from these registries and through collaborations with other researchers throughout the world. Machine learning is expected to be widely used in lifelong health management [27] , and in the near future, we will build a large database that will be constantly updated and close to daily clinical practice. In addition, we would like to integrate the clinical and multi-omics data to establish an algorithm that can be applied for the diagnosis of IgG4-RD and other diseases, and for the prediction of prognoses, such as for drug selection, and responses to treatment. Based on the results of this study, we believe that AI will facilitate the further understanding of pathological conditions and enable drug discovery.",

A Decision tree algorithm. The blue color in the figure indicates the predicted percentage of IgG4-RD cases, and the red color indicates the percentage of non-IgG4-RD cases. The CART tree model revealed that the key process fluctuations leading to the diagnosis of IgG4-RD in this process were the age at the first visit, several serum biomarkers, and the peripheral counts of white blood cells and its fractions. For example, the right branch of the CART tree indicated that if age at the first visit \u226551.5 years, serum IgM level was <201 mg/dL, peripheral counts of leucocytes <10,960/\u03bcL, serum IgG level was \u22651,253.5 mg/dL, and serum IgA level was <289.5 mg/dL, it was shown that IgG4-RD is significantly more likely than non-IgG4-RD.

The validation of this algorithm showed that its accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.852, 0.917, and 0.667, respectively, and the AUC was 0.763 IgG4-RD from non-IgG4-RD. When the serum IgG4 level was known, it was the most important factor for the diagnosis, and the age at the first visit and the concentrations of Ig and sIL-2R were also important variables.
