Despite the scientific evidence on the effectiveness of social distancing measures, they are not being practiced uniformly across the U.S. Accordingly, the role of compact development on the level of adherence to social distancing measures has not been empirically studied. This longitudinal study employs a natural experimental research design to investigative the impacts of compact development on reduction in travel to three types of destinations representing a range of essential and non-essential trips in 771 metropolitan counties in the U.S during the shelter-in-place order amid the COVID-19 pandemic. We employed Multilevel Linear Modeling (MLM) for the three longitudinal analyses in this study to model determinants of reduction in daily trips to grocery stores, parks, and transit stations; using travel data from Google and accounting for the hierarchical (two-level) structure of the data. We found that the challenges of practicing social distancing in compact areas are not related to minimizing essential trips. Quite the opposite, residents of compact areas have significantly higher reduction in trips to essential destinations such as grocery stores/pharmacies, and transit stations. However, residents of compact counties have significantly lower reduction in their trips to parks possibly due to the smaller homes, lack of private yards, and the higher level of anxiety amid the pandemic. This study offers a number of practical implications and directions for future research.",

First, density could increase awareness of the virus and make residents more precautious about following social distancing recommendations. In addition, residents in dense areas have more shopping options in close proximity to their place of residence while people in low density, suburban areas often have to rely on a single big-box retailer such as Walmart for all of their shopping needs which potentially increases the concentration of people in the store, the need for travel, and the length of the trips. Third, urban density facilitates online shopping and urban shoppers are more likely to shop groceries online (Farag, Schwanen, Dijst, & Faber, 2007) . The same applies to online restaurant home-delivery orders. The service that is less likely to be available in outer lowdensity suburban areas.",

Previous studies found that older adults and non-White population are more likely to avoid public spaces, large gatherings, and public transit during the epidemic outbreaks such as SARS and Avian Flu (Jones & Salathe, 2009; Lau, Yang, Tsui, & Kim, 2003; Rubin, Aml\u00f4t, Page, & Wessely, 2009 ). Previous studies from Hong Kong during the SARS and Avian Influenza also show that highly educated individuals are more precautious to practice protective behaviors such as social distancing (Lau, Kim, Tsui, & Griffiths, 2007; Leung et al., 2003) . Similarly, according to a series of studies, by Quinn, Kumar, and colleagues, low-income and less-educated individuals have more exposure to the H1N1 Swine Flu pandemic due to the lack of access to recourses such as workplace policies, paid sick days and job security that would enable them to practice social distancing (Kumar, Quinn, Kim, Daniel, & Freimuth, 2012; Quinn & Kumar, 2014; Quinn et al., 2011) . These findings have been confirmed by recent studies, in March and April 2020, focusing on the COVID-19 pandemic (Block, Berg, Lennon, Miller, & Nunez-Smith, 2020; Weiss & Paasche-Orlow, 2020; Wright, Sonin, Driscoll, & Wilson, 2020) .",

            "text": "Perhaps one of the greatest indicators of social distancing measures both in terms of putting the order in place by elected officials and also complying with the order by public is the political affiliation. Research shows that individuals' viewpoints and behaviors are largely shaped by the views of their political party leaders (Cohen, 2003) . In other words, political partisanship is an influential force in shaping citizens' attitudes and preferences (Satherley, Yogeeswaran, Osborne, & Sibley, 2018) . The behavior towards the COVID-19 pandemic is not an exception. A recent study in the U.S. points to the political partisanship as the strongest predictor of the early adoption of social distancing policies with Democratic \"blue\" states implementing the Shelter-in-place order far earlier than Republican \"red\" states (Adolph, Amano, Bang-Jensen, Fullman, & Wilkerson, 2020; Painter & Qiu, 2020) . As of April 2020, even after more than 1.2 million confirmed cases and 70,000 deaths in the U.S., still five Republican states including Arkansas, Iowa, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota have not adopted the shelterin-place order (Mervosh, Lu, & Swales, 2020) . Accordingly, the Republican party leaders and the conservative media have been accused to downplay the severity of COVID-19 pandemic (e.g. Smith, 2020) which has led to substantially lower level of concern by Republican voters; according to multiple national polls, in March and April 2020 (CIVIQS, 2020; Gallup, 2020; . In the same line, recent empirical studies in the U.S. counties showed that Republican voters had been less engaged in social distancing from January 27 to July 12, 2020 to reduce the risk of transmission (Allcott, Boxell, Conway, Gentzkow, Thaler, & Yang, 2020) . In addition, previous studies show that democrats are more likely to rely on science in decisionmaking than conservatives who tend to be more skeptical of scientific evidence and recommendations (Blank & Shaw, 2015; Kraft, Lodge, & Taber, 2015) .",

In other words, higher levels of social capital and civic engagement could indicate a higher level of social responsibility and particularly compliance with the government decisions that collectively benefit the society such as social distancing, according to two recent studies published in March and June 2020 (Barrios, Benmelech, Hochberg, Sapienza, & Zingales, 2020; Dyevre & Yeung, 2020) .",

Due to hierarchical structural for the data (days nested within counties) we employ hierarchical modeling in this analysis which is explained in the next section. Note that social distancing interventions could be implemented in different ways including the school and business closures, isolating infected people from others, wearing masks, adherence to the 6-feet standard distance with other people and the mandatory stay-athome order which requires all residents to stay at home and leave their residential place only for essential needs. The focus of this study is only on stay-at-home order as one form of social distancing interventions. Table 1 presents the list of outcome and independent variables, the data sources, and descriptive statistics. All variables are computed for 771 metropolitan counties in the U.S; although the final sample for each model depends on the availability of travel data to each destination.",

According to Google, the mobility metrics are generated based on a set of anonymized information from Google users who opted-in to Location History. Google includes travel data from every Android user who has agreed to turn on location tracking and iPhone users that have Google Maps installed on their smartphones. Google computes the percentage changes of these metrics from a baseline based on historical data. The reference baseline is defined as a five-week period from January 3, 2020 to February 6, 2020 and the baseline value for each day of the week equals to the median value of the same days of the week during the five-week period. For instance, for any Friday the baseline value would be the median value of five Fridays in the 5-week baseline range. The changes in movement (compared to the baseline) for each destination is published as a percentage and if there is not sufficient data to ensure anonymity or reliability of metrics, the value for that specific day and/or destination has not been reported (Aktay et al., 2020) .

MLM accounts for the dependency among individual observations which in our work would be the observed days for each county. Furthermore, within a multilevel model, each level in the dataset (e.g. repeated observations within counties) is represented by its own sub-model (see Fig. 1 ). In other words, MLM can be used to estimate individual growth models for each county and the regression parameters such as intercepts, slopes are used as random effects to explain the variation in level-2 (county level) along with other level-2 (county level) independent variables (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002) . Basically, a separate curve is estimated for each county, with a different intercept and slope. Then, at Level-2, the intercepts and coefficients from Level-1 are modeled in terms of the full range of county-specific variables. County variables were uncentered, as is typically the case in growth curve models. These are random coefficient (random slope) models, as the slopes of the power functions were found to vary significantly from county to county.",

A power function was chosen because we observed that the relationship between the dependent variables versus days since the effective day of shelter-in-place order is non-linear, as show in Fig. 1. As Fig. 1 shows, the reduction rates in trips to the main three destinations increase at first and then decrease over time. Given the initial explosive growth of reduction in trips, we would expect that the number of days since the shelter-inplace order was in place is raised to a power greater than 1.0 for most counties. These plots also show the day-by-day variation of compliance with the stay-at-home order in each county. Again, MLM allows us to model this daily variation while accounting for the hierarchical structure of the data and the variations in the county-level factors. Days were grand mean centered, meaning that they were measured as deviations from the grand means across all of the counties. At some point, based on the plots generated for counties like Cook County, IL, or New York County, NY, the drop in trips will level off to form an S-shaped or logit curve while in San Francisco County the compliance with the stay-athome order increase at first and then decrease forming a U-shaped curve. This U-shaped curve is the case across most counties and metropolitan areas of the United States, so the simpler power function seems the right functional form for this modeling exercise.",

This is not surprising considering the wellestablished literature that shows physical and psychological health benefits of parks and greenspaces (e.g. Sugiyama, Leslie, Giles-Corti, & Owen, 2008) . Shelter-in-place order could lead to an increase in the sense of anxiety and isolations in people due to extreme restrictions about social gatherings in workplace, school, and other non-essential places (Jacobson, Lekkas, Price, Heinz, Song, O'Malley, & Barr, 2020) . A visit to park serves as a feasible alternative to families for mitigating the anxiety and stress that is generated by the pandemic and its consequences (Jennings & Bamkole, 2019) . It is also possible that in some states the stay-at-home order puts more restrictions in place for people's visit to parks. Based on our review of stay-at-home order policies in different states, in most cases the policy allows residents to have a short walk or a visit to parks, following the 6-feet standard distance with others; however, there may be more restrictions in some states and/or counties that is not controlled in this analysis.",

For instance, Miami County in Florida has experienced the most reduction (71.9 percent reduction) in park trips while Calumet county in Wisconsin has about 193 percent increase in park trips during the shelter-in-place order. The highest reduction in trips to transit stations belongs to Arlington County in Virginia (about 83 percent) while Shawnee County in Kansas has experienced about 9 percent increase in trips to transit stations. Summit county in Utah has the highest reduction (about 58.5 percent) in grocery trips while Henderson County in Kentucky has experienced 38.6 percent increase in trips to grocery store and pharmacy, compared to the baseline. Our HLM models investigate the role of compact development and other confounding factors in explaining the observed geographic variations in trips to these destinations across the U.S. metropolitan counties. Note that all findings are only applied to the stay-at-home order period and are not applicable to possible reductions in prior days during the pandemic.",

            "text": "Tables 3-5 present the HLM models for trips to grocery store/ pharmacy, park, and transit station; respectively. We present the findings related to the variable of greatest interest (compactness score) in this section. Please see Technical Appendix A for model results and discussion of other control variables. Measures of overall model fitness show that the models perform reasonably well. According to Garson (2013), the likelihood ratio (LR) test helps to assess the fitness of Random Coefficients (RC) model using the reduction in deviance of RC models with predictors comparing to the intercept-only (null) model without predictors. The LR test shows whether the reduction was statistically significant which; as the result, the fit of a RC model is significantly better than the null model. We conducted this test and included the results in the Tables 3-5. The results of these tests show that our three RC models' deviances are significantly lower than their null models at the 0.001 probability level across all three models. One of the most important findings of this study is that travel reductions during the shelter-in-place order change over time in a nonlinear form, as shown in Fig. 1 . More days since the shelter-in-place order leads to significantly higher reductions in people's trips to groceries/pharmacies, parks, and transit stations while Republication counties (with the higher percentage of residents who voted for President Trump in 2016) are less likely to experience this reduction. However, the negative sign of days-squared indicates that, at some point in time since the effective date of the shelter-in-place order, the curve turns into a declining trend (see Fig. 1 ). While we don't have an explanation for this finding, we share one possibility. According to a recent study of shelter-in-place order in Italy, individuals are more likely to jeopardize compliance with the social-distancing measures when they face negative surprises. An example of such surprises is giving a certain date for ending the shelter-in-place while it could be unrealistic due to unexpected outcomes of the pandemic. Sharing a certain end date can falsely generate optimistic expectations while decision-makers will ultimately need to extend the given end date; which would be a negative surprise for the public. This situation causes disappointment leading to individuals jeopardizing their compliance with the stay-at-home order (Briscese, Lacetera, Macis, & Tonin, 2020) . Note that the relationship between percent reduction in grocery trips and days-squared is not statistically significant likely due to a large variation between counties.",

First, the relationship between the number of days since the effective day of the shelter-in-place order and reduction in travel is non-linear. At the beginning of the shelter-in-place order, there is a high reduction in people's travel and the reduction in travel has an increasing trend for the first few days. But as we move forward with the order, at some point in time, which varies from county to county, the curve turns into a declining trend, meaning that there is less observed reduction in travel compared to the previous days. This is a common pattern that we observed in trips to all three destinations. It is still an open question why people are more in compliant with the shelter-in-place order at the beginning and what factors change in the middle of this journey that leads to the changes in travel behavior. Considering how costly is the shelter-in-place order to the citizens, communities and the government, these questions are important and call for further investigations in future studies. Second, we found that the challenges of compliance with the stayat-home order in compact areas are not related to minimizing essential trips to grocery store and pharmacy. Quite the opposite, residents of compact areas are doing a much better job in reducing their essential trips and have significantly fewer and shorter trips to destinations such as grocery store, pharmacy and transit station. Indeed, compact development could facilitate the implementation of stay-at-home orders due to better services of home-delivery grocery shopping. It is also possible that residents of dense places voluntarily engage in social distancing; being more cognizant of the threat.",

This situation coupled with the smaller homes and the lack of private greenspaces (yard) in compact counties could increase the feelings of anxiety and isolation and visiting a park appears to be one was of mitigating these mental and psychological challenges.",
