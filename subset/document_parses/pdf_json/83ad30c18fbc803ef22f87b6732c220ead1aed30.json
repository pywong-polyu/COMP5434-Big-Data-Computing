Furthermore, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, there has also been a rapid shift to promote asynchronous learning through electronic platforms. [11] [12] [13] Electronic self-paced modules (SPM) may be a promising alternative given the flexibility it offers students and the appeal it has to the millennial generation. [14] [15] [16] Studies have compared TDS to SPM in teaching EBM to undergraduate MS, and have found SPM as effective as TDS in improving knowledge and attitudes. 5, 17, 18 However, there is limited data to investigate the effectiveness of SPM for enhancing the application of EBM knowledge and skills to actual patients in the clinical setting. 6, 8, 19, 20, 21 We aimed to compare the effectiveness of a single traditional classroom session (TDS) versus an interactive self-paced, multimedia module (SPM) on the application of EBM skills to an actual patient encounter among pediatric clerkship students. As a secondary aim, we compared changes in knowledge, attitudes, confidence and ability to access evidence between TDS and SPM teaching methods and describe student reflections regarding EBM.",

Prior to using the t-test, Levene's test was used to determine the homogeneity of variance and met the assumption (p=.55). The mean CAT scores were also compared in the subgroup of MS-2 students that had not yet taken the EBM course at the medical school using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The secondary outcomes i.e. the average scores on knowledge, as well as 5-point Likert scale items for attitudes, confidence, and frequency of accessed data sources were analyzed using repeated-measures analysis using the mixed model procedures (PROC MIXED with REPEATED statement to take into account the covariance structure of the data). The protocol defined in PROC MIXED used the REML (restricted maximum likelihood) option with subjects as random effect and time as repeated measure with an autoregressive heterogeneous (ARh) covariance matrix option. The ARh covariance matrix was used because the time period between sessions varied in the protocol. The least square means (LS means) statement of SAS PROC MIXED was used and compared between sessions and also sessions at each time point using the Student's t test. Missing data was assumed missing at random. To assess for attrition bias due to missing data at 3 months, a sensitivity analysis was performed with inclusion of only students that completed all three time points of data for secondary outcomes.

This finding is important for educators who aim to integrate EBM teaching in the clinical setting. In our setting, the TDS and SPM sessions followed by the CAT assignment served as review of fundamental EBM concepts plus application of the concepts to a real patient case carried by the student. We were pleased to see that the students' general reflections encompassed not only the importance of EBM but strategies for efficient integration into practice, the utility of EBM and even specific future goals. The reflections show how teaching application of EBM in the clinical setting puts EBM knowledge into meaningful context for the students. When determining which modality of teaching is best suited for a program, educators should weigh the challenges of developing SPM with the challenges in sustaining TDS. TDS requires availability of instructors to sustain this mode of teaching whereas SPM comes with the cost of the software, skills needed to use the software and time.",

Students reported a mild decline in attitudes toward EBM and a decline in the frequency of accessing evidence. By including EBM curricula throughout clerkships, students could continue to practice strategies to identify evidence relevant to their clinical questions and become more comfortable with the uncertainty that can arise when only small studies or lower quality studies are available. Furthermore, suboptimal role models for evidence-based practice are a barrier to teaching. 32 Certainly, this barrier would be more pronounced when trying to implement longitudinal EBM curricula. The SPM mode for asynchronous teaching and utilization of academic health librarians as instructors could be tools to help overcome this barrier. 33 Integrating a librarian led session to teach and reinforce efficient search strategies related to clinical questions could have a sustainable impact on students.",

[14] [15] [16] Lastly, due to COVID-19 pandemic, educators have had to create innovative educational opportunities and there has been a quick shift towards virtual learning. The shift to distanced learning may serve as a footing for continued virtual teaching options even in the post-pandemic era. [11] [12] [13] Since completion of this study, the SPM has been incorporated into the clerkship curriculum and feedback has been positive. We have several strengths and limitations to our study. One strength is the design of our study with randomization and blinding. Our study, however, utilizes a single center with students from one medical college and these students do receive one EBM course during their 2 nd year of medical school. It is uncertain whether the results would differ for MS who do not receive any early education in EBM. It is possible that one mode of learning may be more effective over the other for these students. We had a small sample of MS-2 students (n=11) that did not complete the course at the medical school prior to participation and their mean scores were lower. Further studies are needed to evaluate the most effective mode of teaching for students that receive EBM education for the first time during clerkship.",

We did not have literature available from prior research to guide a sample size calculation but our estimates of the primary outcome, the CAT scores, are very similar between groups with overlapping, narrow confidence intervals making type II error unlikely. Another limitation of this study is the low three-month response rate for the survey results. We are reassured, however, that outcomes measured in students that completed all 3 times points of surveys were similar to the full population making the likelihood of attrition bias low. Additionally, we conducted analyses as per the modality of teaching received rather than the group assigned but there was minimal cross-over between groups and the characteristics of students in SPM and TDS remained similar, making bias unlikely. Blinding of facilitators or students was not possible due to the nature of the interventions but the students were unaware of the grading rubric used for the CATs and the grader for the CATs was blinded to group assignment and student identity. Lastly, in students randomized to the SPM, adherence to completion of the module, the timing of viewing the module during the rotation and time spent on the module was not formally tracked.",

For the subgroup of MS-2 students (n=11) that did not complete the medical college EBM course prior to participation, the mean CAT scores were 73.0 (95% CI 59.7-86.2) and 82.5 (95% CI 59.7-105.3) for SPM and TDS, respectively (p=0.78). Secondary outcomes were available via questionnaire for 100% (127/127) pre-course, 95% (121/127) post-course and 33% (42/127) 3 months post-course. Baseline pre-test knowledge, attitudes, confidence, and accessing evidence were not statistically different between groups. (Table 2) Small but statistically significant improvements were seen in all outcomes from precourse to post-course in both TDS and SPM interventions. (Table 2, Figure 2) Improvements were sustained from pre-course to 3-month post intervention for knowledge and confidence for SPM and TDS.
