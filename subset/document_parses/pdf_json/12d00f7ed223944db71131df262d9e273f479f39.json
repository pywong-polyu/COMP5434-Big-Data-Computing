            "text": "For preventing the outbreaks of Covid-19 infection in different countries, many organizations and governments have extensively studied and applied different kinds of quarantine isolation policies, medical treatments as well as organized massive/fast vaccination strategy for over-18 citizens. There are several valuable lessons have been achieved in different countries this Covid-19 battle. These studies have presented the usefulness of prompt actions in testing, isolating confirmed infectious cases from community as well as social resource planning/optimization through data-driven anticipation. In recent times, many studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of short/long-term forecasting in number of new Covid-19 cases in forms of time-series data. These predictions have directly supported to effectively optimize the available healthcare resources as well as imposing suitable policies for slowing down the Covid-19 spreads, especially in high-populated cities/regions/nations. There are several progresses of deep neural architectures, such as recurrent neural network (RNN) have demonstrated significant improvements in analyzing and learning the time-series datasets for conducting better predictions. However, most of recent RNN-based techniques are considered as unable to handle chaotic/non-smooth sequential datasets. The consecutive disturbances and lagged observations from chaotic time-series dataset like as routine Covid-19 confirmed cases have led to the low performance in temporal feature learning process through recent RNNbased models. To meet this challenge, in this paper, we proposed a novel dual attention-based sequential autoencoding architecture, called as: DAttAE. Our proposed model supports to effectively learn and predict the new Covid-19 cases in forms of chaotic and non-smooth time series dataset. Specifically, the integration between dual self-attention mechanism in a given Bi-LSTM based auto-encoder in our proposed model supports to directly focus the model on a specific time-range sequence in order to achieve better prediction. We evaluated the performance of our proposed DAttAE model by comparing with multiple traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning-based techniques for time-series prediction task upon different real-world datasets. Experimental outputs demonstrated the effectiveness of our proposed attention-based deep neural approach in comparing with state-of-the-art RNN-based architectures for time series based Covid-19 outbreak prediction task.",

            "text": "In the end of year 2019, the rapid spread of novel corona-virus pandemic, named as: Covid-19, over the world has causes tremendous pressures on multiple social aspects. This pandemic also leads to major challenges for researchers in various disciplines (Khan et al., 2021; Kucharski et al., 2020; Liu, Magal, Seydi, & Webb, 2020; Wu, Leung, & Leung, 2020) . Recently, the appearance of Covid-19 \u2032 s delta variant (Li, Lou, & Fan, 2021) has dramatically increased the number of infected patients who need intensive medical treatments. These public health associated disasters has led to severe burdensome for the hospitals even with countries that had high-levelled public healthcare systems and infrastructures (Micah et al., 2021) . In fact, this variant of Covid-19 is considered as the most contemporary dangerous one. It has flagged out a new pandemic wave through the world with an unimaginative speed. Many real-world case studies in different countries have showed that the tremendous growth in the healthcare requirements for Covid-19 patients. It is the results of fast person-to-person transmission (Fidan & Yuksel, 2021; Pitchaimani & Devi, 2021) of the Covid-19 delta variant as well as shortage of suitable strategies for preventing the spreads of virus among groups of confirmed Covid-19 cases to other healthy ones. In addition, the shortage of proper data modelling and short/long-term Covid-19 outbreak forecasting solutions also led to challenges for the governments to effectively manage as well as plan for social resource optimization (Nascimento et al., 2021) .The accurate pandemic forecasting mechanism also supports for the governments to properly impose suitable policies to simultaneously deal with the expansion of Covid-19 as well as ensure the social/economic stability (Miao, Last, & Litvak, 2022) . Due to the severe influences of this pandemic in multiple social aspects, it is considered as necessary for building data analysis systems which support to capture the spreading temporal patterns of this pandemic. These systems can explicitly support for governments to have suitable plans in both economic recovery and daily life renormalization. Therefore, it is needless to say that the precise forecasting in number of new COVID-19 cases is considered as an important problem. The prediction results can be utilized to facilitate the planning of available resources in public healthcare system. Moreover, for the long run it supports to efficiently optimize the social management strategies/policies for Covid-19 spread prevention as well as treatments for infected patients. To deal with the pandemic outbreak prediction problem, many researchers have proposed different statistical/mathematical and machine learning (ML)-based approaches as data-driven predictive solutions (Khan et al., 2021) for fighting against the rapid escalations of new confirmed Covid-19 cases.",

            "text": "Since, the medical reports of confirmed infectious cases are collected and stored as time series data form, most of predictive models are designed to learn capture temporal and sequential patterns of Covid-19 outbreaks. Commonly in most of countries, the outbreaks of Covid-19 frequently occurred at different spreading levels which are tightly respected to specific time-dependent periods. Moreover, recent studies also show that the spreading level of this pandemic is also relied on the changes in some natural aspects, like as temperature, seasonal weather, etc. (Chin et al., 2020; Zhou, Gao, Xie, & Xu, 2020 ) Therefore, the fluctuation patterns of these outbreaks are naturally non-linear and dynamic which are mainly depended on multiple natural/non-natural aspects. Moreover, the traditional linear and statistical prediction approaches are considered as unable to capture non-linear temporal information from the reported daily confirmed Covid-19 cases. This type of dataset might contain high level of chaotic observations, noises and disturbances due to the influences of multiple internal/external aspects. In general, most of classical linear time-series data-driven prediction models highly relied upon the regression paradigm without the capability in considering non-linear data patterns. Therefore, within the Covid-19 outbreak prediction problem, they might totally fail to sufficiently capture the dynamism of Covid-19 infectious transmission through the community at different time-dependent periods. Moreover, from the perspective of real-world applications, the Covid-19 pandemic prediction system should be able to continuously learn from previous historical data in order to obtain the long-range and temporal features from data to achieve better and more accurate predictions. From the past, multiple statistical models, like as: Auto Regressive (AR), Moving Average (MA), Auto Regressive Moving Average (ARIMA), Nonlinear Auto-regression Neural Network (NARNN) etc. have been widely applied to capture the linear patterns of routine number of confirmed infectious case data to conduct forecasting. However, these models are still far from sufficiently preserving the real-time and temporal information from reported Covid-19 routine data.",

            "text": "Recently, there are several studies presented the efficiency of applying ARIMA model in the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak prediction problem (Katris, 2021) . In this approach, the reported Covid-19 data is modelled as the time series pattern to achieve useful information for predicting the new Covid-19 infections. In very recent years, the integrated ARIMA-based approach is utilized as the predictive model is widely applied in different time series datasets. The ARIMA and its variants are widely used due to its flexibility in analyzing temporal information from a given time series dataset through using different statistical ordered parameters. Recent works have demonstrated success of ARIMA integrated predictive systems in handling prediction task for multiple types of infectious diseases (Cao et al., 2020; He & Tao, 2018; Liu, Liu, Jiang, & Yang, 2011) , including the Covid-19 pandemic (Benvenuto, Giovanetti, Vassallo, Angeletti, & Ciccozzi, 2020; Dehesh, Mardani-Fard, & Dehesh, 2020) . However, most of ARIMA-based predictive techniques are still unable to preserve temporal information as well as perform the non-linear regression to deal with complex and highly-noise routine reported Covid-19 data. This type of infectious data is majorly influenced by different external aspects. In order to deal with the non-linear and complex sequential data pattern learning, there are several studies (Ceylan, 2021; Wu et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2014) have applied the NARNN-based approach to enable the capability of predictive system in performing non-linear and time-series based data analysis problem. In this approach, the temporal information is efficiently preserved from the input time-dependent observations through the neural network based learning paradigm. In general, the NARNN is considered as a neural network based approach which explicitly supports to obtain the temporal information from time series data through utilizing different sequences of a given dataset and train them with corresponding parameter weights through the back-propagation learning procedure. Recent enhancements (Ceylan, 2021; Hansun et al., 2021) in the integration of NARNN with predictive systems have demonstrated remarkable performances in dealing with short-term Covid-19 outbreak forecasting problem. The successes of NARNN in complex time series based prediction task has clearly indicated that deep neural network is the potential and key factor for achieving better performance in temporal/sequential data representation learning and prediction problem.",

            "text": "Recently, there are notable achievements of deep learning in multiple disciplines of computer science domain, like as natural language process (NLP), computer vision (CV), etc. These deep learning's progresses have shed lights on reaching higher level of sequential/temporal data representation learning as well as time series based prediction task (Lim & Zohren, 2021) . Among advanced deep neural architectures, recurrent neural network (RNN), like as: Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM), etc. have played an indispensable role in time series data modelling and representation learning problem. Among RNN-based architecture, GRU and LSTM are considered as the most popular deep neural architectures. These RNN-based architectures have been widely utilized in different types of time series based modelling and fine-tuning processes for effectively handling prediction problem. Specifically, GRU and LSTM can effectively learn and capture the long-range temporal information in forms of generated hidden states through different sequence-connected neural state cells. There are several recent studies (Chimmula & Zhang, 2020; Zeroual, Harrou, Dairi, & Sun, 2020) have shown the outperformances of LSTM-based neural architecture in time series based Covid-19 new case prediction task. The LSTM model enables to capture temporal information representation learning and time-dependent training for data prediction. However, most of recent RNN-based time series based predictive models still encountered several major limitations. The limitations are mainly related to problems in handling highly noise/non-smooth sequential data as well as long-range dependency. Since, the reported Covid-19 cases are sometime reported as a cumulative sequence with multiple upward/downward trends which produce a non-smooth sequential data pattern. Thus, it might challenge the capability of LSTM in logically preserving these disturbances to make correct predictions. Moreover, the most of RNN-based architectures like as GRU/LSTM is unable to learn and properly interpret long input sequences due to the vanish/explosion of gradient during the backpropagation learning process. In order words, LSTM-based predictive models tend to likely focus and remember much on it last processed sequences rather than preserve the long-range dependencies of all input sequences. Therefore, it might fail to sufficiently capture the trends of Covid-19 outbreaks within long-range periods.",

The utilization of sequential auto-encoding (AE) mechanism in In this study, for achieving better performance in Covid-19 case prediction problem, we utilize a sequential (Bi-LSTM) based autoencoder to encode and generate rich-semantic temporal representations of historical observations. The learnt rich temporal information from sequences are later used to assist the fine-tuning process of Covid-19 trend forecasting problem. In general, the application of AE enables to learn a latent representation of the data which is split into different neural components (encoding/decoding). It later allows us to efficiently disentangle the latent time-dependent features from the given set of historical observations which are currently evaluated. Specifically our proposed DAttAE model in this paper is designed upon the inheritance of the well-known sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) architecture (Sutskever, Vinyals, & Le, 2014) . To deal with noises/lagged observations from time-series dataset, it is integrated with the attention mechanism (Bahdanau, Cho, & Bengio, 2015; Vaswani, 2017) which is mainly inspired from the NLP domain. In general, the historical confirmed Covid-19 case data in forms of time series are passed through an autoencoding based architecture. The given sequential AE is composed with two separated Bi-LSTM based encoder and decoder as a sequential self-learning approach (as illustrated in the main block of Fig. 1-A) . Within the given proposed AE architecture, first of all, we achieve the concatenated (backward/forward) hidden states of the input sequences in forms of reported number of Covid-19 cases within a specific timedependent range through the encoding component. Then, the encoder's outputs are fed into another Bi-LSTM architecture to simultaneously interpret and produce the transformed hidden states of the original input sequences. Next, both learnt hidden states of the encoding and decoding components of our given AE are passed through separated attention layers to generate the combined attention weights (as illustrated in the Fig. 1-B) . The ultimate purpose of applying the dual selfattention filtering mechanism in the outputs of the Bi-LSTM based AE architecture is to estimate the importance levels of all data entries in each input sequence. It directly supports to enhance the prediction finetuning process in the after all. Finally, the concentrated attention weights of both encoder and decoder are fed into a full-connected layer to predict the number of Covid-19 cases.",

In order to deal with this problem, in our approach the neural attention mechanism has been adapted to achieve noise-reduced sequential representation of a given input sequence.

However, most of traditional approaches like as the popular auto-aggression based techniques (ARMA, ARIMA, etc.), Na\u00efve Bayesian probabilistic addictive decomposition techniques for time-series, etc. have failed to sufficiently capture the long-range time-dependent features between consecutive observation entries. Moreover, within the short/long-term time series prediction approach through deep learning, multiple complex recurrent neural network based architectures have been utilized to dealing with the long-ranged historical observation representation learning. These RNN-based models have sufficiently supported to capture the richsemantic time-dependent features within time-series dataset to performance significant improvements. However, these deep learning based predictive model normally performed inaccurate predictions while dealing highly noise/chaotic sequential datasets with unpredicted growing patterns like as the routine reported Covid-19 case dataset. In recent times, there are few works have been concentrated on the utilization of attention mechanism within the sequential auto-encoding paradigm. The utilization of neural attention based mechanism with different full-connected components have effectively assisted to capture the short-term growing patterns of disturbing/chaotic time series datasets. Majorly inspired from previous works for the case study of Covid-19 outbreak prediction, we dedicated our efforts on discovering on how the integration between dual self-attention neural architectures can efficient support the sequential AE-based architecture.

These NARRN-based models (Ceylan, 2021; Hansun et al., 2021) support to model the flexible timedependent growth patterns of Covid-19 diseases in different real-world datasets. In general, the NARNN approach is basically considered as an initial artificial neural network based technique. It mainly relies on neuron-varied learning paradigm to deal with the time series based modelling and prediction problem. On the same approach of applying multi-layered neural architecture for handling Covid-19 spreading prediction problem, recent works of Wieczorek, M. et al. proposed an application of stacked multi-layered full-connected neural architecture to preserve the temporal information from the routine reported Covid-19 datasets (Wieczorek, Si\u0142ka, Wo\u017aniak, 2020) . However, the simplicity of NARNN architecture is considered as unable to preserve the long-range temporal information of complex time series datasets to effectively perform the short-terms prediction.",

For the general literature reviews of potential applications of different deep neural architectures in sequential data representation learning and Covid-19 outbreak forecasting problem, Zeroual et al. (Zeroual et al., 2020) have conducted extensive comparative studies between different RNN-based and auto-encoding (AE) based architectures to present the potentiality of these advanced neural architectures in handling real-world time series based Covid-19 datasets.

To evaluate the accuracy performance of this Covid-19 risk zone categorization task, we mainly used two metrics which are the Accuracy and F-1 measure (as shown in equation (9) and (10)).

Each GRU's neural cell contains two types of logic gates: reset and update which support to control the preserved sequential information of each data entry in a sequence when it is passed through it.

For the dataset VN-62P is the zone classification for 62 provinces of Vietnam. Similar to that, for HCMC-12D dataset is the zone classification for 12 high-populated/large districts in HCMC, Vietnam. In order to conduct Covid-19 zone identification depending on criteria which have been described in previous section, similar to the daily Covid-19 case prediction problem, we used the trained deep learning-based models, including our proposed DAttAE model, to predict the daily number of infection cases in each region (provinces for the VN-62P dataset and districts for the HCMC-12D dataset). Then, we relied on the assessment criteria for Covid-19 risk zone categorization in Table 2 to identify the corresponding classes (red, orange, yellow and green zones) for all regions at specific time-steps. Finally, the Covid-19 risk zone categorization results are evaluated under the Accuracy and F-1 evaluation metrics for the comparison purposes between different baselines. We evaluated the performance of each model in Covid-19 risk zone classification task with two types of time-interval, which are: daily and weekly. The Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 show the experimental outputs for both daily and weekly Covid-19 zone risk classification task through different techniques, within the VN-62P and HCMC-12D datasets, respectively. Specifically, as shown from the experimental outputs, our proposed DAttAE model also slightly leverage the accuracy performance of Covid-19 risk-zone classification task in both VN-62P and HCMC-12D datasets. In more specific, our proposed DAttAE model explicitly achieves better accuracy performances in terms of F-1 based accuracy than the GRU, LSTM and Bi-LSTM approximately 3.92 %, 2.79 % and 1.57 %, within the VN-62P dataset and 12.33 %, 14.15 % and 1.53 % within the HCMC-12D dataset, respectively. In comparing with recent deep learning based studies, such as: COVID-ANN and COVID-RNN, about proposed DAttAE model also achieve better performances for this task about 5.41 % and 1.79 % in the VN-62P, 5.06 % and 8.01 % in the HCMC-12D dataset.",

Specifically, for the experiment with number of training epochs, we trained our model with different number of epochs within range of [10, 500] and reported the changes in accuracy performances for the Covid-19 case prediction task in terms of RMSLE assessment metric. The experimental outputs in Fig. 10 -A presented that the DAttAE model achieved the stability in accuracy performance within 400-500 training epochs for both VN-62P and HCMC-12D datasets. For the (k LSTM ) parameter, the experiments in Fig. 10 -B showed the ideal number of used LSTM's cells for our model is about \u2265 32.

The accurate daily Covid-19 infection case forecasting and risk zone categorization provide crucial information to governments for effectively planning social resources and imposing suitable policies to prevent the Covid-19 pandemic escalation in different regions. To effectively model and retain the temporal and growing patterns of time series based reported Covid-19 confirmed infection cases, we proposed a novel Bi-LSTM based auto-encoding mechanism with the custom dual selfsupervised attention mechanism, called as DAttAE. The proposed DAt-tAE model not only enables to sufficiently preserve them temporal information from complex/non-smooth time series dataset but also ensures the readiness of learnt sequential embedding vector for dealing with the short-term prediction problem with chaotic noise/disturbance through the application of self-supervised attention mechanism. The utilization of attention mechanism for integrating with the archived sequential embedding vectors which are produced by encoder and decoder supports to estimate the important level of all data entries in each input sequence. Then, the calculated attention weights of input sequences are later used to explicitly facilitate the forecasting-driven fine-tuning process in the after all. The application of attention mechanism with RNN-based architecture such as Bi-LSTM enables to better preserve longer chaotic time series in which temporal latent features are sufficiently capture within deeper neural network architectures. Extensive experiments in real-world reported Covid-19 datasets in Vietnam demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed ideas.",

The proposed model in this paper might be useful for the governments to effectively forecast as well as optimize multi-sector social resources for preventing the Covid-19 pandemic spreading. To effectively deal with complex and non-smooth fluctuations of routine reported infectious cases and deliver more accurate prediction results, we applied the custom dual attention mechanism within our Bi-LSTM based sequential auto-encoding model to efficiently reduce noises and lagged observations from the Covid-19 reported data. The effectiveness of our proposed ideas in this paper have been demonstrated through extensive experiments in real-world Covid-19 datasets. However, our proposed DAttAE still be unable to incorporate the routine reported Covid-19 data with other associated information resources, such as external environmental/geographical aspects in order to achieve better prediction results. The environmental/geographical aspects like temperature, contamination, geographical locations, etc. (Bashir et al., 2020; Rasheed, Rizwan, Javed, Sharif, & Zaidi, 2021) are considered as important direct/indirect factors which might lead to the raise in number of Covid-19 infectious cases.

Therefore, traditional statistical methods might be unable to sufficiently fit non-linear patterns of the given dataset which leads to the downgrade in the accuracy for short-term prediction of Covid-19 transmission growth. Same on the statistical approach, recently Zhang et al. proposed a the R0-based statistical technique for forecasting the Covid-19 infection rate of the outbreak which was occurred in the Diamond Princess cruise ship[7]  . Similar to that, Varotsos, C. A. et al. proposed a novel probabilistic model, called as: Covid-19 Decision-Making System (CDMS) to measure the spread of Covid-19 disease for prompt actions and further planning activities(Varotsos & Krapivin, 2020). Also considered as an probabilistic approach, in recent studies(Amaral, Casaca, Oishi, & Cuminato, 2021),Amaral, spreading predictive model which is relied on the Spread of Disease (SIR) model(Cooper, Mondal, & Antonopoulos, 2020) to evaluate and forecast the Covid-19 outbreaks in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil and Brazil. However, it was still unable to accurately predicting complex non-linear escalations of Covid-19 cases in different time steps. Moreover, traditional mathematical and statistical techniques are also limited in retaining the temporal information from the routine reported infectious cases in forms of time series data.",
