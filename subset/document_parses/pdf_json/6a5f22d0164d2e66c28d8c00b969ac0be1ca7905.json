Objectives To determine the feasibility and preliminary effectiveness for larger randomised controlled trials of 3D headmounted (HMD) virtual reality (VR) for managing cancer pain (CP) in adults. Methods Thirteen people receiving palliative care participated in a single-session randomised cross-over trial, after which they completed a qualitative semi-structured interview. We also compared the effects of 3D HMD VR and 2D screen applications on CP intensity and levels of perceived presence. Feasibility was assessed with recruitment, completion rates and time required to recruit target sample. Results Although recruitment was slow, completion rate was high (93%). Participants reported that the intervention was acceptable and caused few side effects. Although participants reported significantly reduced CP intensity after 3D HMD VR (1.9 \u00b1 1.8, P = .003) and 2D screen applications (1.5 \u00b1 1.6, P = .007), no significant differences were found between interventions (\u2212.38 \u00b1 1.2, 95% CI: \u22121.1-.29, P = .23). Participants reported significantly higher levels of presence with the 3D HMD VR compared to 2D screen (60.7 \u00b1 SD 12.4 versus 34.3 \u00b1 SD 17.1, mean 95% CI: 16.4-40.7, P = .001). Increased presence was associated with significantly lower pain intensity (mean 95% CI: \u2212.04-\u22120.01, P = 0.02). Conclusions Our preliminary findings support growing evidence that both 3D and 2D virtual applications provide pain relief for people receiving palliative care. Given the relative lack of cybersickness and increasing access to portable VR, we suggest that larger clinical studies are warranted.",

Recent meta-analysis shows pain prevalence in people with cancer at 66% in advanced metastatic disease compared to 39% after curative treatment and 55% during anticancer treatment [2] . While patients prefer care at home, data unfortunately show that here is where pain control is poorest and is undertreated in about one-third of patients [3] . Pharmacological treatments for CP show significant adverse effects on quality of life plus the potential interactions with anti-cancer drugs [4, 5] . Psychological factors further contribute to the experience of CP where distress is shown to significantly increase pain severity and pain-related disability [6] . Despite best practice advocacy for pain management in palliative care settings [7] , there remains a significant burden of unrelieved pain.

VR is a computer-simulated creation of a 3D environment [8] and is an effective treatment for medical and psychological conditions such as post-stroke rehabilitation and anxiety [9, 10] . Current VR systems include head-mounted devices (HMDs) with 3D-enabled glasses with additional devices including headphones for noise-cancelling and sound, head and/or body-tracking sensors and other input hardware such as joysticks and data gloves [11] . Together these form a realistic multisensory experience described as a real or simulated environment where the perceiver experiences a sense of presence, defined as an illusion of 'being there' [12] . Investigations into the mechanisms of VR analgesia in experimental settings show that the degree of analgesic effect is dependent on the user's sense of presence in the virtual environment [13] . Moreover, meta-analysis shows no difference in effectiveness between specifically developed software and commercially available games using 3D environments [14] , thus increasing access to affordable VR options for use in experimental and clinical pain settings.",

Both 3D AND 2D platforms were well tolerated by participants who described positive experiences during and after sessions. Encouragingly, all participants reported they would use VR regularly if given the chance. Thus, given this positive feedback in association with the high completion rates, user comfort, increasing ease of access to affordable VR platforms and encouraging quantitative findings, prospect of future studies is promising. Although this feasibility study was not powered to detect differences between intervention and control, our findings indicate that participants with CP report significant decreases in CP intensity during, immediately post-intervention and up to 20 min after both interventions. However, although participants reporting significantly greater levels of presence during 3D HMD VR compared to a 2D screen session, there were no significant differences in reductions of post-treatment pain intensity between the two interventions. This may be due to participants being able to sit comfortably close to the screen using the bedside table and not feel confined by the headset. Qualitative feedback contributes a deeper evaluation of positive and negative experiences that may explain these findings. First, high levels of user satisfaction engagement and immersion especially using 3D HMD VR support differences in levels of presence between platforms. Second, given the low level of CP intensity at baseline, participants may have had difficulty perceiving changes after each intervention. These latter findings are supported by previous work showing more moderate to severe pain at baseline predicts more significant responses to analgesic interventions [35, 36] .",

Our findings for 3D HMD VR are comparable to a previous study using similar technology on people reporting CP. Using ESAS, Niki and colleagues investigated the effects of 3D HMD VR (Google Earth\u00ae) to reduce symptom severity in 20 terminal cancer patients [37] . Here, both studies report comparably significant reductions in all symptoms except nausea and lack of appetite using 3D HMD VR. Given the association between a lack of appetite and nausea in people with advanced cancer and the potential for cybersickness when using VR, these results are understandable.",

Not surprisingly, they found significant decreases in pain intensity due to the combined analgesic effects of immersive VR and morphine. The greater effects of VR in combination with another form of analgesia are further supported by previous studies where decreases in SCI pain intensity were greater using 3D HMD VR plus transcranial direct current stimulation compared to VR alone [38, 39] .",

            "text": "The duration of VR analgesia is an important factor. Analgesic actions of VR are divided into two types: distraction and neuroplasticity. Distraction as investigated in this study represents short-term diversion of attention away from pain towards an alternative stimulus described as 'hijacking' attention, emotion and memory. These effects have most recently been shown in mood-related populations where using functional magnetic resonance imaging, VR interventions decrease activity in the thalamus and limbic areas associated with anxiety and pain both acute and chronic [40, 41] . Alternatively, neuroplasticity relates to long-term functional and structural changes in neuronal pathways that occur following long-term practice of skills, such as playing a musical instrument or VR use involving interactive real-time simulations of skills or activities. In this study, we investigated short-term analgesic effects that were assessed during, immediately and up to 20 min following each intervention session. Attention distraction is most likely the best explanation for the analgesic effect of VR for pain in this study, especially concerning short-term or single session VR use.",

Second, due to COVID-19, study recruitment was slower than anticipated. Encouragingly however, another common reason for non-participation was the successful management of pain on the ward where potential participants reported no pain at the time of assessment for eligibility. However, although the low sample size may have contributed to reduced significance in analgesic effect between the two groups, the size of the effect following 3D VR (43%) is encouraging and suggests a strong albeit temporary analgesic effect. The significant link between immersiveness and analgesia combined with the findings indicating the significantly greater sense of presence with 3D VR also supports the potential of 3D VR to produce analgesia in this setting.",
