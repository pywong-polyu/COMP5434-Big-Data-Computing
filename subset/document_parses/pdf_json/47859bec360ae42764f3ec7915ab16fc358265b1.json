We employed a mixed methodology (bottom-up [20] , using the costs generated by acute ischemic stroke patients within the Cluj County Emergency Hospital (CEH); and top-down [20] , which takes budgets allocated to CEH for specific procedures such as thrombolysis, and other public data on chronic care from the framework contract, on pensions and informal care [11, 21, 22] ). This study was designed from the societal perspective [23] to include multiple types of costs incurred by ischemic stroke, impacting society as a whole. The study's main objective was to estimate in-hospital direct costs and indirect costs of first-ever acute ischemic stroke patients from Cluj county who have been treated in a stroke-like center (CEH) between the 1 January 2019 and 31 December 2019.",

Patients were excluded based on age (minors), past or present diagnosis of hemorrhagic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA), known history of stroke, and receiving treatment in Cluj but residing in another county. For patients included in our study cohort, we excluded hospitalization caused by stroke relapse and have included only AIS index cases.

Based on informant consultations, we also included patients with a primary diagnosis of G81 (hemiplegia and hemiparesis) with I63 recorded as any of the first three secondary diagnoses during 2019. According to our interviews with key stakeholders, AIS patients are routinely coded with G81 to increase per-patient tariffs. Based on a subgroup of AIS patients already matched upon receiving the database, 17.10% of patients with an index case received have been eligible for thrombolysis and have a primary diagnosis coded with G81 followed by secondary diagnosis coded with I63. The practice of purposely miscoding acute ischemic stroke patients is used in order to increase hospital funding. Identifying a first-ever ischemic stroke was challenging due to the fragmentation of electronic medical health records at the national level. Medical histories could not be correlated across several hospital databases due to data anonymity and lack of access. Patients previously treated for AIS at CEH were excluded based on medical history. CEH medical records require physicians to describe patient status and diagnosis. Based on this string field, we performed several operations for case selection using the wildcard filter option of Tableau Prep data cleaning software. Keywords used to identify candidates for the manual exclusion of patients with prior stroke were \"recurrent\", \"repeated\", \"repetition\", \"relapse\", and \"antecedent\". We also excluded deliberate (e.g., I63 classification otherwise labeled explicitly as TIA) and accidental (e.g., I63 classification described explicitly as HS) miscoding using the same method, with appropriate synonyms for each criterion.",

The framework contract for providing medical services at the national level stipulates that a patient has access to one initial rehabilitation consultation, two check-ups, and twenty-one procedures [28, 29] . The cost of primary care was calculated by averaging quarterly values for per capita and per service funding, multiplied by the number of hospitalized patients (inhospital deaths were excluded), and the number of points and consultations [30] . Hospital subsidies were computed by dividing expenses from state budget subsidies and expenses from local budget subsidies [31] to the total hospitalization days in 2019.

Next, we calculated the cost of mortality for members of the active population who have died before hospital discharge. The number of patients from the active population who died during initial hospital admission (n = 7) was added to the GDP per capita for 2019 [34] and to the exchange rate for June 2019 for USD [35] . The cost for state pension was obtained by multiplying the number of inactive patients by the number of months and the average value for a state pension in 2019 for Cluj county [21] . The age threshold for the inactive population was calculated based on gender, date of birth, and month of retirement of the active population. Costs generated by patients who have died before hospital discharge were used in computing the cost of mortality for first-ever AIS patients. The cost of subsidies for disabled stroke survivors was calculated by multiplying the number of active patients from the population with the average value for social compensation [11, 21] . Informal care was estimated based on the ratio between informal care and productivity from the \"European Cardiovascular Disease Statistics 2017\" report [22] .

The results of our costing exercise are similar to those reported by Lorenzovici et al. (2020) , where hospitalization and laboratory tests are the highest inpatient cost, drivers. This study used hospital financial controlling data to measure in-hospital costs generated by stroke patients from six hospitals (first-ever and recurrent cases), classified according to I60.0-I66.9 (ICD-10). Our average figures for direct medical cost lie between \"Clinical Hospital 2\" (EUR 1230.27) and \"City Hospital 2\" (EUR 1011.55), as reported in the study mentioned above [18] .",

Our study also fails to include transportation costs for patients residing outside of Cluj-Napoca and patients admitted to rehabilitation wards through interhospital transfer or on-demand. Informal care provided by a family member or by paid caregivers is not included. This is a gap in our analysis, since studies have shown that even though patients had access to rehabilitation, they still need daily help after stroke onset [57] . Finally, this study does not consider out-of-pocket expenditure in the private sector (roughly 20% of financing at the national level) and informal payments. Based on these limitations, we conclude that the amount of indirect cost is likely to have been underestimated. Our study has several methodological strengths, including using all first-ever AIS patients hospitalized in the timespan of one year in the selected center and calculating stroke-related costs from the societal perspective for one year, the recommended time window for the cost of illness studies [20] . Our work also provides insight into the incidence of first-ever AIS cases in Cluj county in 2019, the equivalent of 164 cases per 10,000 inhabitants.",
