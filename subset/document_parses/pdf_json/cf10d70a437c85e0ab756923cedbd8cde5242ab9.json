Therefore, most antiviral discovery efforts are focused on the re-purposing of clinical stage or approved drugs. While emerging data on drugs undergoing COVID-19 repurpose are intriguing, there is an undeniable need to develop broad-spectrum antivirals to prevent future viral pandemics of unknown origin. The ideal drug to curtail rapid viral spread would be a broad-acting agent with activity against a wide range of viruses. Such a drug would work by modulating host-proteins that are often shared by multiple virus families thereby enabling preemptive drug development and therefore rapid deployment at the onset of an outbreak. Targeting host-pathways and cellular proteins that are hijacked by viruses can potentially offer broad-spectrum targets for the development of future antiviral drugs. Such host-directed antivirals are also likely to offer a higher barrier to the development and selection of drug resistant mutations. Given that most approved antivirals do not target host-proteins, we reinforce the need for the development of such antivirals that can be used in pre-and post-exposure populations.",

To date, this novel coronavirus has infected over 33 million people in 213 countries and resulted in over 1million deaths worldwide [2] . Despite SARS-CoV-2 being the seventh known coronavirus to infect humans, the therapeutic landscape has remained barren, creating an urgent demand for the development of effective therapeutics for COVID-19 patients. While effective COVID-19 management requires both antiviral and antiinflammatory treatment strategies, the need for a potent and safe antiviral for therapeutic and prophylactic use is undisputed. However, the expectations of developing safe and selective antiviral agents in a short time frame are impractical given that drug development from target discovery to approval takes 12 years on average [3] . Therefore, initial efforts have been focused on the repurposing of clinical stage or approved drugs. Even with therapeutic repurposing as a rapid strategy to redirect approved or clinical-stage drugs that were originally discovered for other diseases, the global community has witnessed the intricacies, nuances and challenges of drug development.",

            "text": "Most approved antiviral drugs target viral proteins, often acting selectively against one virus. Historically, drug development efforts have disproportionately focused on targeting viral proteins leading to the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs). However, viruses exploit numerous host proteins to carry out essential steps in their life cycles, and these proteins can be targeted for the development of hostdirected antiviral agents (HDAs). Since viruses from one family often employ the same host proteins, targeting these proteins can produce agents with broadspectrum antiviral activity and offer a higher barrier to the development of drug resistant virus strains. A key feature of HDAs is that their development can occur prior to the discovery of a new viral pathogen. The need for HDAs is underscored by the fact that there are over a dozen zoonotic viruses that have caused deadly human disease in recent years and will remain potential sources for future outbreaks. The last decade alone has witnessed two epidemics prior to COVID-19 in the form of the 2012 MERS epidemic (caused by another coronavirus) and the 2016 Zika epidemic (caused by an arthopod-borne flavivirus). A pre-existing repertoire of first-line, broad-acting HDAs that can be readily deployed may be beneficial in slowing the initial viral spread or in suppressing outbreaks. Later, HDAs can be complemented with DAAs and vaccines since their development hinges on the knowledge of specific viral proteins. While broad and deep investigation of viral-host pathways and targets is needed, the following examples illustrate a few of many cellular pathways that are utilized by different viruses, including coronaviruses, to replicate and cause infections.",

The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) is a ubiquitously expressed serine protease that is crucial to the cleavage and activation of both, hemagglutinin (HA) of human influenza viruses and the spike (S) protein of SARS-like coronaviruses [12] . TMPRSS2 is dispensable for host development and homeostasis and thus may constitute an attractive therapeutic target [13] . Camostat, a clinical-stage serine protease inhibitor, is able to block viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses [12] . Serine proteases involved with the pathogenesis of respiratory viruses are classified as trypsin-like proteases) which possess structurally conserved active site. This feature of trypsin-like proteases may be exploited for the design of inhibitors with broad-spectrum activity [14] . However, such targets are not without limitations as viruses often access molecular and biological redundancies in their host. Although camostat inhibited SARS-CoV-2 entry and replication, it did not completely abolish viral replication, likely reflecting residual S protein activation through alternative means. This is not surprising as the SARS-CoV-2 can also use the endosomal cysteine proteases cathepsin B/L to activate and prime its S protein in TMPRSS2 null cells. However, it must be noted that S protein processing by TMPRSS2, but not cathepsin B/L, is essential for viral entry [15, 16] .",

Inhibition of IMPDH leads to depletion of intracellular guanine nucleotide (GTP /dGTP) levels and thus limits RNA and DNA synthesis needed for viral replication.

            "text": "Gordon et al. expressed 26 tagged, SARS-CoV-2 proteins in human cells to identify proteins that physically associated with each viral protein. They identified over 300 host proteins that bind to SARS-CoV-2 proteins, many of which are suspected of contributing to the viral life cycle. Among the interactors were Sigma1 and Sigma2 proteins. The authors tested 69 approved or clinical-stage compounds and found that the drug compounds targeting either the mRNA translation and/or regulators of Sigma1 and Sigma2 receptors displayed a prominent antiviral effect. Sigma1 receptors are localized at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes and the mitochondria-associated membranes (MAM). They are multifunctional proteins involved in essential cellular processes, including protein folding, degradation, ER trafficking and oxidative stress, cell survival, and mitochondrial function [24] . Sigma1 receptors have previously been implicated in the regulation of Hepatitis C [25] and Sendai virus replication via modulation of ER stress and the antiviral innate immune response [26] . Since multiple viruses induce ER stress, the Sigma1 receptor could be possible therapeutic target.",

While chemistry associated toxicities routinely encumber any drug development program, pathway-related toxicities are more complex. A common benefit of DAAs is that they are designed to hit a viral protein and not a host protein, thereby reducing theoretical concerns of off-target effects. However, even with DAAs, off-target effects are unavoidable as there are over tens of thousands of known host proteins. For HDAs, such considerations must take center stage as targeting proteins or pathways that are important to cellular development and homeostasis should be avoided. The cardiac toxicity of HCQ in the COVID-19 setting effectively illustrates this point [8] [9] [10] . In the development of HDAs, the prospect of pathway-related toxicities will require more rigorous investigation in the preclinical and translational stages of drug development. These concerns must be tempered by the fact that such liabilities are routinely faced in the development of drugs for non-viral diseases where host proteins are consistently pursued, including diabetes, oncology and autoimmune diseases. Thus, modern drug development teams are adequately prepared to include such considerations during the mechanism of action and translational workup on a drug candidate.",

It is noteworthy, that such riskbenefit analysis was recently employed by the FDA and the Data Safety Monitoring Committee in the ATCC-1 trial endorsing an emergency approval of remdesivir for COVID-19. While serious adverse effects (SAEs) were reported in 114 of the 541 (21%) patients in the remdesivir group, the approval suggests a higher tolerance for accepting SAEs in favor of the benefits associated with short term use.",
