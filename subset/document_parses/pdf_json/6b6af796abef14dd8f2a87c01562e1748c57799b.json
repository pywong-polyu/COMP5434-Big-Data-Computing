Thus, distance education has also been put into practice for nursing education. 3, 4 However, the issue on how to maintain basic skill practices and communication skills training, which are the primary elements of nursing, is an issue of concern in our country, as it is in various other countries. 4 On the other hand, instead of considering distance education as a single method used for nursing education, it is considered as a method that supports formal education, ensures patient safety, reinforces life-long learning, and provides equality in opportunity. 5 Distance education is defined as a systematic teaching technology where students and instructors are present in different places, providing individuality, flexibility, and independence to students in terms of time and location. 6 The learning environment in distance education is provided with the student management system (SMS) established using certain software systems. The SMS is composed of certain elements for teaching-learning, which enable the management of the environment via a network connection. The system provides educational software for distance learning, enabling classes to be held simultaneously or asynchronous and provides various functions (e.g., animations, videos, and addingediting-sharing teaching materials, such as presentations, interactive virtual classes, debates and forums, surveys, assignment giving, reports, and messaging) to users for the teaching-learning environment. 3, 6 In Turkey, distance learning for nursing was first started in 1993 for the undergraduate program. This was followed by the nur- Institute has been providing distance associate degree education for surgical nursing, pediatric nursing, public health nursing, fundamentals of nursing, and psychiatry nursing since 2012-2013. 7, 8 In general, it can be stated that in Turkey, distance nursing education is used for associate degrees, degree completion, and graduate studies. It is not used for undergraduate education, it is also not accessible by nurses and nursing students. 8, 9 Considering the vagueness of the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains uncertain as to how much more nursing education can be maintained entirely through distance education. Thus, distance education should be a matter of concern both locally and globally to embrace the concept of life-long learning and to make it accessible for everybody. 10 Nursing students, who are important elements of the nursing education system, should be sufficiently qualified to fulfill the requirements of this system. It is important to identify nursing students' attitudes towards distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic and the factors affecting these attitudes, and to introduce necessary regulations to increase the levels of these attitudes. Accordingly, this study was conducted to investigate the factors affecting nursing students' attitudes towards distance education during the COVID-19 pandemic, seeking answers to the following questions:",

Because of the COVID-19 pandemic, at the university where the study was conducted, nursing education at undergraduate and graduate levels was provided on a common online platform, so the attitudes of all nursing students towards distance education were asked to be questioned. The sample size was calculated using the simple random sampling method with a known population (n = Nt 2 pq/d 2 (N \u2212 1) + t 2 pq; N: population size, n: sample size, p: frequency of occurrence of the event under examination, q: unprecedented frequency of the event under investigation, t: theoretical value obtained from t table with a certain degree of freedom and margin of error, d: desired \u00b1 deviation according to the frequency of the event). The power of the study is defined by 1-\u03b2 (\u03b2 = probability of type II. Error) and research must have 80% power in general. In our study, the number of cases to be included to reach 80% power at \u03b1 = .03 level was calculated as 280; however, it was more appropriate to consider it as 310 due to possible losses. The study was completed with a total of 318 students (84% of the population).

Creating content is one of the most important elements of distance education.3 Although the instructors of our university are experienced with creating class content for the nursing curriculum, they needed technical support for creating online class content and presentations. On the other hand, distance education is an unusual method, especially for nursing, and our education system did not have sufficient infrastructure and hardware to support it. However, the student information system of all universities in our country established infrastructure support units to swiftly provide classes. Thus, classes of nursing students were conducted without any problems via computer programs, such as Adobe Connect, Microsoft Teams, and Zoom. All questions that the students had on classes and how to use the system were answered and solved 24/7 by both the student information support unit and the instructors of our university. Therefore, the positive attitudes of the students towards the academic operation of the education might indicate that the education was provided successfully during the COVID-19 pandemic period at the academy where the research was conducted.",

Thus, a different teaching method could be tried to develop positive attitudes in nursing students towards distance education. The effects of distance education during the COVID-19 period on nursing students could be investigated in different studies. Moreover, new and different methods could be developed on how to maintain a wholesome nursing education during COVID-19 and possible future pandemics.",
