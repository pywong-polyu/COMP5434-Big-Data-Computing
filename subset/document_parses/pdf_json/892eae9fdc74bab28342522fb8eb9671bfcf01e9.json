The results of the heterogeneity analysis show that the influence of CCCP is more significant in the provinces with weak law enforcement and small hydropower investment and northern provinces. This study suggests that the Chinese government can promote corporate technological innovation by improving the environmental compensation system and increasing environmental law enforcement to improve electrical energy efficiency. Meanwhile, renewable energy projects should be the focus of future investment.",

            "text": "With the increasing frequency of human economic activity, global warming intensifies, and the global temperature is estimated to rise by 1.5 \u00b0C between 2030 and 2052 (Ipcc, 2018) . Therefore, how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions has been a perennial topic of concern for scholars (Mills, 2011; Zhang and Fan, 2019; Talaei et al., 2020) . Currently, global coal consumption is the main source of greenhouse gas emissions (Zeng et al., 2021) . Dieter (2012) attributed the failure of the Kyoto Protocol to the neglect of the Abstract In recent years, energy efficiency has been considered an extremely cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. China is a country with the world's largest coal consumption and heavy reliance on thermal power generation. Therefore, the relationship between the coal consumption constraint policy (CCCP) in China and electrical energy efficiency is a topic worthy of study. Based on the panel data of 30 provinces in China during 2005-2016, this paper employs the difference-in-differences (DID) to examine the impact of CCCP on electrical energy efficiency in China. The results indicate that the implementation of the CCCP reduces electrical energy efficiency in the pilot provinces. Based on the mechanism tests, increase in global greenhouse gas emissions because of coal consumption. Steckel et al. (2015) considered that the growth of coal consumption in China, India, and other developing countries is the main reason for the increase in energy production's carbon intensity. As the world's second-largest economy, the increasing energy consumption and environmental pollution in China have raised widespread concerns about the sustainable development of its economic growth (Bi et al., 2014) . Especially in terms of its coal consumption, it has become a dominant topic in climate change mitigation (Korsbakken et al., 2016; Tang et al., 2018; Zhang, Bai, et al., 2018; Zhang, Liu, et al., 2018) . According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy 2021, China is currently the largest coal energy consumer and the largest emitter of carbon dioxide (see Fig. 1 ). From 2011 to 2020, China's total coal consumption accounts for approximately 50% of the world's total coal consumption (see the upper part of Fig. 1 ). In addition, China's total CO 2 emission is also a quarter of the world's total CO 2 emission (see the bottom part of Fig. 1 ). Due to many advantages such as large reserves and low prices, coal has been dominant in China's energy consumption, which far exceeds the average of 20% in developed countries (Guo et al., 2018) . However, while supporting the rapid development of China's economy and society, it can also bring severe environmental problems (Hao et al., 2015) . Under this background, the coal consumption constraint policy (CCCP) was proposed by the Chinese government in 2011 in order to reduce the consumption of coal and protect the environment. Previous studies have investigated various topics related to the CCCP, which mainly focused on two aspects. One is to explore the relationship between CCCP and economic growth (Bloch et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2018; Chai et al., 2019) . The other is to predict the peak of coal consumption and future coal demand under the Chinese control plan (Hu et al., 2014; Li, Liang, et al., 2015; Li, Lin, et al., 2015; Zhang, Bai, et al., 2018; Zhang, Liu, et al., 2018) . However, there are few studies in the literature considering the relationship between CCCP and electricity. To improve environmental quality and change energy structure, China has implemented a strategy of \"electricity energy substitution\" 1 to achieve sustainable development. It cannot be ignored that, as a country that relies heavily on thermal power generation, coal accounts for 63.22% of all power generation fuels in China (see Fig. 2 ). Consequently, China's coal power generation will inevitably release large amounts of greenhouse gases (Bi et al., 2014) .",

However, the causal relationship between CCCP and electrical energy efficiency has not been examined. Hence, this study regards the CCCP's introduction as a quasi-natural experiment and employs the DID model to address the endogenous problem. Secondly, for research in the field of electricity, the impact of CCCP on electricity consumption, renewable energy generation, and the pattern of power transmission has been explored in previous literature (see Table 1 ). This paper focuses on electrical energy efficiency and examines the impact of CCCP on electrical energy efficiency, which expands existing research and provides new evidence on CCCP. Finally, this paper further illustrates the impact mechanism of CCCP on electrical energy efficiency from the perspective of the super-position of cost effect and innovation effect, which makes up for the gap between the CCCP and energy efficiency in the field of mechanism research. The rest of this paper is organized as follows. \"CCCP and its influence on electrical energy efficiency in theory\" provides a brief overview of China's coal consumption constraint policy and its theoretical effects on electrical energy efficiency. \"Data and methodology\" introduces the data and methodology. \"Empirical results\" shows the empirical results and offers robustness checks. \"Further discussion\" explores the mechanism and conducts a heterogeneity analysis. \"Conclusion and policy implications\" provides the main findings and policy implications.",

In 2011, the \"Twelfth Five-year Plan for Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction\" defined a group of CCCP pilot areas, including the Jing-Jin-ji Region (Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei), Yangtze River Delta (Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Jiangsu), and Pearl River Delta (Guangdong). Until 2013, the macro-policy requirements on CCCP were basically established. However, no specific technical programs or measures were put in place. From 2014 to 2016, the government issued specific measures, and the coal equivalent substitution was included in the environmental impact assessment. Coal consumption management in China entered the phase of \"coal equivalent substitution.\" During this phase, the thermal power sector becomes the main target of treatment. The replacement of coal comes mainly from implementing centralized heating, energy-saving technology for coal-consuming equipment and the use of clean energy, etc. After 2016, coal consumption Fu and Wu (2018) Under the background of the CCCP, the power transmission scale will still increase, whereas the ratio between coal and electricity transmission will display a downward trend Ji et al. (2018) The CCCP will stimulate renewable energy generation, especially in wind power Chen and Chen (2019) The natural gas and electricity consumption would be increased by implementing CCCP, contributing 15% and 4% to national SO2 and NOx emission control targets Guo et al. (2020) The CCCP has a positive impact on the share of electricity consumption in total energy consumption. The proportion will be increased by 4.898%",

            "text": "The coal consumption constraint policy belongs to the category of environmental regulation. At present, two competing academic perspectives regarding the impact of environmental regulation on energy efficiency are prevailing. The first academic perspective is based on the Porter hypothesis (Porter 1991) . The prominent argument of this view is that environmental regulation has incentives to induce technological innovation in the regulated firms, generating a compensatory effect of innovation and improving energy efficiency (Berman & Bui, 2001; Bi et al., 2014; Telle & Larsson, 2007) . Specifically, reasonable environment regulation can change the impact of price effect and market scale effect on energy factors, which shifts the preference of technological innovation (Acemoglu et al., 2014) . There are opportunity costs 2 associated with the use of energy factors in the context of environmental regulation. If the opportunity cost is more significant than zero, the relative price of energy factors will increase, promoting technological innovation in favor of energy conservation. Additionally, the implementation of environmental regulation leads to external constraints on the energy use of market subjects and inhibits their impulse investment and blind expansion of scale. This will weaken the impact of the market scale effect on energy use and thus discourages technological innovation in favor of energy use. As an external constraint, CCCP can raise coal prices and accelerate the closing or reconstruction of small power plants, facilitating efficient technologies (Li, Liang, et al., 2015; Li, Lin, et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2011) . The continuous innovation of key technologies can be used at each value chain stage (generation, transmission, distribution, and end-use) to improve electrical energy efficiency (ASSAf 2018) gradually. Furthermore, Abdallah and El-Shennawy (2019) also emphasized that energy-saving technology innovation is particularly crucial in the process of improving electrical energy efficiency through the design of new projects and the revamp of old pieces of equipment. Hence, this study proposes the first hypothesis:",

In this case, the benefits of technological innovation cannot make up for the costs of pollution control, which will not contribute to improvements in energy efficiency. CCCP is a kind of strict environmental regulation. It may encourage power generation companies to switch from coal consumption to natural gas consumption (Wang et al., 2020) . However, due to the higher energy substitution costs, Chinese companies tend to follow the pollution mode of \"pollution first and treatment later\" and use its environmental investment to treat pollution (Yuan & Geng, 2010) . In the face of the increasing electricity demand, high economic and environmental governance costs will not be conducive to improving electrical energy efficiency (Reyna & Chester, 2017) .

To examine the impact of CCCP on electrical energy efficiency, this paper uses panel data of 30 provinces 4 across the country from 2005 to 2016 as the research sample. Firstly, the data used to calculate the electrical energy efficiency is collected from the China electric power yearbook. Secondly, the data of other variables are collected from the China statistical yearbook and provincial statistical yearbooks, China's environmental yearbook, China statistical yearbook on the environment, Almanac of China's water power, and Chinese research data services platform (CNRDS). Table 2 shows the definition and calculation of all variables concerned. For selecting control variables, Guang (2020) showed that the effect of industrial structure and the level of foreign trade on electrical energy efficiency are positive. In contrast, the effect of urbanization rate is negative. Wang and Yan (2010) found that the degree of economic development positively impacts electrical energy efficiency. Hence, these factors are introduced into the baseline model as control variables. In addition, the proportion of mining workers and environmental pollution control investment are strongly associated with electrical energy intensity (Guo et al., 2020) .

Based on this, we selected these two factors as control variables as well. Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics of variables.

Compared to traditional DEA models, the superefficient SBM-DEA model further ranks the simultaneously efficient DMUs (efficiency values can be greater than 1), thus facilitating comparative analysis. This paper follows Han and Liu's (2011) approach to calculating each province's electrical energy efficiency by using the undesired output as a production input.

With the growth of China's economy and accelerated urbanization in recent years, the electricity demand has been growing steadily. Unless there is a major reform of the electricity market, it won't be easy to further improve electrical energy efficiency significantly in a short time (Feng et al., 2018) . Therefore, the directions of the coefficients in Table 4 are all negative, which is consistent with reality. In addition, the coefficients of the interaction term become significant 1 year after the implementation of the policy and the effect of the policy is most pronounced in 2012. This negative impact lasted only 3 years (2012) (2013) (2014) . It can also be noted that the interaction term coefficients show the trend of the first decrease and then increase during these 3 years. The main reason for this is that the thermal power sector has become the main target for the second phase of the CCCP implementation. In conclusion, CCCP only has a short-term disincentive effect on energy efficiency in the electric power industry in the CCCP-covered provinces.",

Therefore, the treatment group and control group can be compared in this paper.

In this paper, the sample covers 30 provinces, and the geographical and economic differences between the samples are great, which presents the large individual differences. Therefore, there may be sample selection bias. To solve this problem, the PSM method is an effective way to handle this (Rosenbaum & Rubin, 1983) . This paper uses \"1 to 1 nearest neighbor matching within caliper\" method for matching propensity scores. Meanwhile, the balancing test is then conducted to check the matching results to ensure the robustness of the propensity score matching (Zhao et al., 2020) . According to Table 5 , the results of all t-tests do not reject the original hypothesis of no systematic difference in the characteristics of the treatment and control provinces, presenting a good pairwise effect. Subsequently, the DID method was adopted to further address the research question, which can effectively reduce the bias of policy evaluation (Heckman et al., 1997) . As is shown in Table 6 , the coefficient of the interaction term in the second column is \u2212 0.1218, which is statistically significant at the 1% level.

The one is that the innovation effect path has a positive impact, and the other is that the cost-effective path has a negative impact. However, the direction of the impact of environmental regulation on energy efficiency may not be determined by a single effect. The findings of several studies have supported the view of the combination effect. When the benefits of innovation compensation exceed the costs of environmental regulation, reasonable environmental regulation can effectively stimulate the production technology innovation of the regulated companies, which leads to increased energy efficiency (Porter & van der Linde, 1995; Curtis and Lee, 2019) . In addition, Popp et al. (2010) found that environmental regulation compresses companies' profit margins in the short run and does not provide incentives for companies to carry out research and development. However, in the long run, this negative impact will improve with increasing investment in technology development. Therefore, this study envisages that the direction of the net effect of CCCP on electrical energy efficiency may depend on the superposition of these two effects. Due to the unavailability of data on cost changes due to CCCP, the path of cost effects cannot be tested directly. Therefore, this paper uses a mediating effects model to complete the direct identification of the innovation effect and the indirect identification of the cost effect. Regarding the selection of mediating variables, the number of green patents is used to measure green technology innovation (GTI). The basic mediating effects model is specified as follows:",

Currently, the political and cultural development gap between China's northern and southern provinces is decreasing, but the economic development gap tends to widen gradually (Guo & Fan, 2019) . Therefore, this paper divides China's provinces into southern provinces and northern provinces using the Qinling-Huaihe line as the boundary and further explores CCCP's heterogeneous impact on the electrical energy efficiency in the northern and southern provinces of China. As shown in Table 8 , the negative impact of CCCP on electrical energy efficiency in northern provinces is significant at the 5% significance level. In addition, the CCCP has no impact on the electrical energy efficiency in southern provinces. The main reason for the decline in the electrical energy efficiency of northern provinces may lie in the heating problem. The northern provinces are rich in coal resources. Heating from the thermal power plant is one of the main types of heat supply, which consumes large amounts of coal. Under the constraints of CCCP, the use of other energy sources for electricity generation entails more technical and investment costs than the use of coal for electricity generation (Shi & Li, 2018) . Therefore, it is challenging to improve electrical energy efficiency in a short time. These provinces are rich in the variety of energy sources used to generate electricity regarding the southern provinces. Besides, there is a high degree of substitutability between energy sources. Thus, the changes in electrical energy efficiency in the southern provinces were not affected by the CCCP.",

Furthermore, this paper also points out the specific impact mechanisms and discusses the heterogeneous impact of the CCCP. The main conclusions are drawn as follows: firstly, the implementation of the CCCP reduces electrical energy efficiency in the pilot provinces. After performing the robustness checks, the result is still robust. Moreover, the results of the dynamic analysis present that there is only a short-term effect of CCCP. Secondly, the cost-effectiveness of CCCP is greater than the innovation effect it brings, which is the main reason that the CCCP has a negative impact on electrical energy efficiency in the pilot provinces. Thirdly, compared to provinces with strong law enforcement and large hydropower investment, electrical energy efficiency in provinces with weak law enforcement and small hydropower investment is highly vulnerable to the negative impacts of CCCP. In addition, the impact of the CCCP also has significant regional heterogeneity.

However, the GCG2012 aims to restrict lending to energy-intensive industries and provide financial support for green industries. In the absence of compensatory policies or financial support, it is difficult for the CCCP to motivate electric power generation companies to innovate in technology. Therefore, the Chinese government should further improve the environmental compensation system and clarify the basis and criteria for environmental compensation. Specifically, they should make full use of the market-based mechanism to levy corresponding taxes or ecological compensation fees on coal resources exported from main coal-producing regions. At the same time, the companies that actively develop energy-saving technology should be given certain tax exemptions, subsidies, or preferential credit. Additionally, it is found that there are North-South differences in the impact of CCCP on electrical energy efficiency. In this instance, the relevant policies must be introduced to encourage the northern provinces to use clean and efficient energy to generate electricity for heating. Besides, the government also needs to develop a reasonable electricity pricing method. The price of electricity that heating companies can afford should be no higher than the price of electricity for coal-fired heating.",

Therefore, the government should increase investments in renewable energy power generation and promote the adjustment of energy consumption structure. For provinces with relatively homogeneous energy supplies, the traditional electric power generation companies should be encouraged to explore industrial models that combine traditional and new forms of electric power generation. Moreover, to ensure the efficient use of renewable energy sources and promote electrical energy efficiency, the electric power industry in China should deepen international cooperation in energy science and technology in emerging areas such as smart energy and energy storage.
