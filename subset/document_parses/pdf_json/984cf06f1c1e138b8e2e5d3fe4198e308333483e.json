A number of possible scenarios were modelled including where 10 overseas cases are introduced daily with open-borders and 90% total population vaccine uptake with a vaccine with VE of 90% for disease prevention and 80% for infection reduction, and prioritisation of high-risk groups for vaccination. In the two-year simulation, this scenario was forecasted to have 11,400 total hospitalisations (peak 324 active and 36 new daily cases in hospitals), and 1,030 total deaths. Where 0-11 year olds are not vaccinated and total population uptake is 80% (the maximum uptake is 84 \u2022 9% and HIT is not achieved) there is an estimated 37,700 total hospitalisations (peak 2,980 active and 343 new daily cases in hospitals), and 3,120 total deaths.

These findings can support policy makers in New Zealand (including the Ministry of Health) to inform their vaccination programme and is generalisable to other countries with closed borders and elimination strategies to ensure optimal vaccination programmes.",

Opening borders without strict isolation will continuously introduce COVID-19 to the community. The NZ government is undertaking a vaccination programme 5 to protect NZ communities. Vaccination modelling can help anticipate potential public health outcomes based on different vaccine effectiveness (VE) reported in clinical trials 6 and 'real-world' studies, 7-10 and vaccination programme strategies. 5 Estimates of the minimal vaccine coverage for herd-immunity with vaccines of different effectiveness, for instance, is needed. Vaccine allocation strategies should also take into account the potential ranges of VE in disease prevention (70-95%) and infection reduction (30-90%) from the first available vaccines including BNT162b2, mRNA-1273, and ChAdOx1 (AZD1222) vaccines.

This can be interpreted as the waning vaccination effect (in the vaccinated group) being balanced by the reinforcement of the vaccination process during the simulation period. This assumption is to separate other effects from the vaccine distribution; v. vaccines are as effective for children and teenagers (age below 16) as they are for other tested age groups; vi.

This strategy requires minimum requirements for vaccine effectiveness and the total uptake to achieve HIT. Therefore, it is used to analyse the minimum herd immunity requirements. The total high-risk population in the second strategy can be estimated as i S i d i , which are the agestratified susceptible populations ( S i ) weighted by their mortality rates due to COVID-19 ( d i ). This strategy begins with vaccination in the oldest groups, followed by the younger groups, because older groups are known to have higher risks for both severe disease and death. 24 , 25 Hereafter, two strategies are referred to as the spreadminimising/minimise R eff strategy and the high-risk (group) targeting strategy respectively.

The strategy which targeted high-risk groups yielded the fewest hospitalisations (active or total) and total deaths in the majority of modelled scenarios ( Table 1 ) . For the high-risk group targeting strategy, a high total vaccine uptake is required that is enough to also cover young adults to achieve better outcomes in general. For instance, in a scenario with R 0 = 4.5 and a vaccine having a VE of 90/70% and 90% population uptake, the high-risk group targeting strategy was forecasted to have the lowest number of deaths and total hospitalisations, i.e. 2,880 vs 5,810 fatalities and 30,100 vs 39,700 hospitalisations (peak active hospitalisations 1,480 vs. 1,310) respectively, Figure 2 . Vaccine effectiveness and New Zealand population vaccine uptake requirements for herd immunity threshold. Note: The minimal vaccine effectiveness on infection reduction and disease prevention for the herd immunity threshold at multiple vaccine uptake levels: (A) R 0 = 4 \u2022 5 and (B) R 0 = 6. The spread-minimising strategy (i.e. minimise R eff ) offers lower requirements of vaccine effectiveness (on both effects) than the high-risk targeting strategy given the same uptake levels. Both effects are considered equal across age groups in this analysis. As the vaccine effectiveness on infection reduction is expected to be not greater than the vaccine effectiveness on disease prevention, all herd immunity lines are limited to the bottom half of the plot (divided by the black line). . Note: Illustration of vaccine allocations for two strategies (i.e. minimising R eff and prioritising high-risk groups). A -shows 80% coverage with 95% (uniform) effectiveness on disease prevention and 90% (uniform) of infection reduction. B -shows the minimal age-stratified allocations required for HIT by the corresponding strategies. The high-risk targeting strategy requires more than 80% coverage ( \u223c90 \u2022 5%) to achieve HIT, while the spread-minimising strategy needs less vaccine uptake for HIT (78 \u2022 2% total coverage). For R 0 = 6.0 near complete coverage for all age groups is required to achieve the herd-immunity threshold. Peak active and total community cases do not include imported cases. All measures related to hospitalisations and deaths (in all scenarios) include imported cases, which are equivalent to the expectations of 4 4 4 total hospitalisations and 49 \u2022 6 total deaths. Note: Forecasts for a two-year simulation. e d is VE of disease prevention. e i is VE of infection reduction. The total community cases include vaccinated cases, who are less likely to develop symptoms, need hospitalisation or die than unvaccinated individuals. A scenario of \"95/90% uniform, 80% coverage\" means that the vaccine has uniform effects across age groups with 95% disease prevention and 90% infection reduction, and the uptake is 80% coverage of total population. HIT is not achievable in the third and fourth scenarios, where the vaccine has poor effectiveness on infection reduction. The last scenario has 80% vaccine uptake when two vaccines are available. The \"dual vaccines'' strategy reused the vaccine allocation from the high-risk (group) targeting strategy. This dual strategy allocated a vaccine with lower effectiveness 70/60% for the five younger age groups and the 90/80% vaccine for the three oldest groups (aged 50 and over). Targeted vaccine strategies: (minimise R eff ) Targeting of younger (socialised) age groups to minimise R eff ; (high-risk) Groups susceptible to hospitalisation and death. Results are rounded to the third significant number.

Where the R 0 value is 6 and 90% total population uptake with the same vaccine, modelling the highrisk group targeting strategy resulted in lower hospitalisations and deaths but higher cases than the spread-minimising strategy, i.e. 6,10 0 vs. 11,70 0 deaths, 59,60 0 vs. 82,60 0 hospitalisations (peak active 5,960 vs. 7,320), 2,860,0 0 0 vs. 2,750,0 0 0 cases (peak active community cases 253,0 0 0 vs. 213,0 0 0). A dual vaccine approach has been investigated where the vaccine distribution follows the high-risk targeting strategy ( Table 1 ) . All groups aged 50 and over are allocated with a vaccine of 90/80% effectiveness and the rest are allocated with a vaccine of lower 70/50% effectiveness. The outcomes of this scenario are 2,180,0 0 0 cases (peak active 175,0 0 0 cases), 95,30 0 hospitalisations (peak active 8,410 in hospital), and total 12,0 0 0 fatalities. These numbers are in between the corresponding outcomes of two scenarios using either one of the two vaccines.",

This estimated VE for infection reduction is higher than the 85% effectiveness for preventing infections that was predicted to result in a reproduction number of 1.58 in the UK. This study did not however account for further reduced viral shedding from vaccinated individuals, reducing onward transmission. 28 Although, HIT is potentially possible e.g. with recent evidence of the BNT162b2 vaccine's effect against infection, 29 it is also possible that emerging effectiveness challenges against new virus variants will necessitate a shift in focus away from herd immunity strategies to protection of at-risk individuals against severe disease. 30 Although the range of estimated VE used in this study are plausible, in particular for the mRNA vaccines licensed in NZ, 11 the lower bounds of VE may need to be extended in the presence of variants of concern. 31 Comparisons of our forecast peaks (with 80% uptake, and 95% VE for disease and 70% for infection) with other countries who had widespread community transmission during the first waves of disease (with no available vaccination) can be made.

This study focused on the initial phase of vaccination, modelling a total vaccine uptake of no more than 50% of the population and applying non-pharmaceutical interventions to reduce the spreading rate. Moore et al. predicted 96,700 deaths (51,800-173,200) if interventions are removed after vaccination with a vaccine that could prevent 85% infections. 28 Sandmann et al. used an age-structured transmission and economic model to estimate the economic impact of vaccination for the UK in a ten-year simulation. 36 This study suggested that vaccination could add substantial health and economic value and population-wide physical distancing might not be justifiable.",

            "text": "Compared with other models used for vaccination studies, the SEIR model used in this study provides a model with fewer assumptions for the same disease dynamics. By grouping individuals of the same disease phase into a compartment, this SEIR model approach only requires transitions among phases instead of requiring numerous rules representing all the disease phases that are used in agent-based models. Although agent-based models have been used to apply a number of assumptions which are useful for understanding the effect of multiple public health interventions, they have limitations due to being computationally demanding. 37 For instance, agent-based models do not integrate age groups, but use averages for the whole population, whereas we know that vaccine distribution across age groups is unlikely to be uniform. 38 The required uptake levels for HIT are subject to an estimated basic reproduction number R 0 of COVID-19 in NZ, national priorities and consideration to protect health and social care workers and the most clinically susceptible groups. While the R 0 value for NZ has not been reliably estimated, its actual value is also probably dependent on seasonality. 39 , 40 Moreover, R 0 is likely to increase with the emergence of the new virus strains. 41 , 42 To consider possible increases in R 0 , a strength of this study is that we also investigated herd immunity requirements for higher R 0 values (4.5 and 6). These R 0 values could be the potential reproduction number of new variants. However, this study does not include changing R 0 values over time (with the introduction of new variants of concern). Rather R 0 values are fixed for the two-year period. Another strength of this work is that the model can be calibrated when more accurate parameter values are available. There is uncertainty with new variants of concern. Model parameters, such as R 0 , latent/infectious periods, and age-structured mortality rates may therefore vary. However, further parameters can be added to the model once evidence of new parameters emerges.",

            "text": "The safe opening of borders in NZ will be dependent on a vaccine that has high effectiveness against both COVID-19 disease and viral transmission. A limitation of our study is that there is still some uncertainty regarding the vaccine effectiveness against transmission. Therefore, modelling strategies and scenarios and forecasting their potential impact on the NZ population with more accurate assumptions (including infection reduction and waning vaccine immunity) needs further investigation. A further limitation is uncertainty around the potential number of imported cases in particular if travel is restricted from regions with high numbers of cases. There is also uncertainty regarding immunesenescence and our assumption of uniform effectiveness across age groups may not hold, although we have modelled vaccine scenarios with a reduction in effectiveness (for both disease prevention and infection reduction) in people aged 60 and over. The targeting of high-risk groups (in an open border scenario), in this case, may not yield the lower total deaths in many scenarios as the disease prevention effect is now lower. This is in contrast to another modelling study which found that, in the event of low effectiveness amongst older adults and no more than 50% uptake level, the advantage of prioritising all adults or adults 20-49 vs. adults 60 + was small. 35 This work provides data on a range of vaccine scenarios and strategies to inform NZ vaccine planning. 5 While research to estimate vaccine effectiveness for reducing severe outcomes and infection is underway, a 70% VE against infection is predicted to be the minimum required to achieve HIT for NZ with an R 0 = 4.5 and 95% total vaccine coverage. As NZ's vaccination plan has not yet included those aged 0-15 years for vaccination, 5 achievement of HIT without vaccinating this group may be impossible, especially if the imported cases are Alpha or Delta variants of concern. 33 Thus, to help reduce cases, hospitalisations, and deaths, other public health interventions will be required to manage the public health response.",
