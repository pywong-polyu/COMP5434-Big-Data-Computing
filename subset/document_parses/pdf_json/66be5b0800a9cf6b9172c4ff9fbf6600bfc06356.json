When dividing ePWV into quartiles, the top quartile had a 4.520 times risk of LVH prevalence when compared with the bottom quartile. Furthermore, smooth spline analysis displayed that the association was linear in the whole range of ePWV (p for non-linearity = 0.073). Additionally, subgroup analysis revealed the association was robust to sex, obesity and diabetes, and younger people and hypertensive population were more vulnerable to the increase of ePWV than their corresponding counterparts. Finally, ROC analysis showed a significant advancement when introducing ePWV into established risk factors (0.787 vs. 0.810, p for comparison < 0.001), and reclassification analysis also confirmed significant improvement from ePWV to identify LVH prevalence (category-free net reclassification analysis = 0.421, p < 0.001; integrated discrimination index = 0.023, p < 0.001).",

Major risk factors of LVH are also contributors for aortic stiffness, including hypertension, diabetes, and renal disease [8, 9] . Therefore, the level of aortic stiffness may act as a surrogate of the cumulative damage of the left ventricle, and thereby represent the severity of LVH. And current expert consensus has recommended carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (cfPWV) as the goldstandard of aortic stiffness [10] . Accordingly, previous studies have demonstrated the significant associations between cfPWV or branchial-ankle PWV (baPWV) and LVH prevalence [11] [12] [13] . However, although the cfPWV or baPWV have standardized measurement procedures [14] , their measurement requires specialized and expensive devices which are rarely equipped in clinical practice, especially in primary care settings [15] . Therefore, daily measurement of cfPWV or baPWV to monitor the severity of aortic stiffness seems impossible. In this regard, there is a need to simplify the technology and research into affordable approach to measure or estimate aortic stiffness.",

Subsequently, the samples were transported to a certified laboratory at Yuhuan second people's hospital for quantitative analysis. A HITACHI auto-analyzer (H700, HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) was used to analyze the quantity of serum creatine (Scr), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). Additionally, 8 percentage of the serum samples were randomly selected and re-tested in the Clinical Laboratory of a 3 rd party institute to enhance the data quality of the laboratory test.",

Continuous variates were showed as mean values (standard deviation, SD) or median (quartile 1-quartile 3) according to the distributions. Categorical variables were displayed as frequency (percentage). Difference between continuous variates with normal distribution was evaluated by student's t test, and difference between continuous variates with skewed distribution was tested by Mann-Whitney test. Comparison of categorical variates between groups was conducted through Chi-square test, disparity of ordinal categorical variates between subjects with LVH or without LVH was revealed by Rank-Sum test. In our work, we use normalized ePWV to replace unnormalized ePWV to act as a continuous variate because each unit change of normalized ePWV equal to 1 SD change of unnormalized ePWV. Therefore, readers can have a better understanding of intensity of the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence because 4 SD change of ePWV can cover over 95% of the total range of ePWV. The normalization process followed the formula: normalized ePWV = (ePWV \u2212 mean ePWV)/SD of ePWV. The independent association between ePWV and LVH prevalence was evaluated by multivariate logistic regression with adjustment of co-variates. The results were displayed as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Moreover, our work employed a generalized additive model with a spline smoothing function and logarithmic likelihood ratio test to evaluate whether the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence was linear in the whole range of ePWV. Finally, our study employed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, category-free net reclassification index (NRI) and integrated discrimination index (IDI) to investigate the value of ePWV in optimizing the identification of LVH prevalence. All the statistical analysis was conducted through SPSS 26.0 software (IBM corp), statistical software packages R (http:// www.R-proje ct. org, The R Foundation) and EmpowerStats (http:// www. empow ersta ts. com, X&Y Solutions, Inc., Boston, MA).

Furthermore, our results showed the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence was linear in the whole range In the plot, the risk of LVH prevalence increased proportionally with the increment of ePWV, and P for non-linearity was insignificant, suggesting the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence was linear in the whole range of ePWV of ePWV. Additionally, our findings suggested our major findings were robust in some common sub-populations, suggesting the value of ePWV in estimating LVH prevalence is applicable to these specified subgroups. Moreover, subjects aged less than 55 years old and participants with hypertension were more vulnerable to the increase of ePWV than their counterparts. Therefore, these subpopulations may deserve more monitoring of LVH and clinical care in the daily practice. Finally, our data showed a significant advancement in the identification of LVH prevalence when introducing ePWV into common cardiovascular risk factors. In general, our work suggests Fig. 3 Subgroup analysis of the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence. The model in each stratum was adjusted for age, sex, education level, income level, physical activity, current smoking, current drinking, BMI, WC, Scr, TC, HDL-c, FPG, MBP, anti-hypertensive therapy, anti-diabetic therapy, lipid-lowering therapy, and CVD history except for the variate that was used to define subgroups (in HTN subgroups, MBP and anti-hypertensive therapy were not adjusted; in DM subgroups, FPG and anti-diabetic therapy were not adjusted). Subgroups of sex, obesity and diabetes showed insignificant interaction with the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence (p for interaction > 0.05). Significant interaction existed between age, hypertension, and the association between ePWV and the LVH prevalence. Younger people and hypertensive population were more vulnerable to the increase of ePWV than their corresponding counterparts regarding the risk of LVH prevalence the potential value of ePWV, a simple surrogate of aortic stiffness, as a risk indicator to optimize the identification of LVH prevalence in the primary care settings. Left ventricle is the target organ of multiple cardiovascular risk factors, especially hypertension and diabetes. And the most common result of the persistent damage to left ventricle is LVH. Published studies have identified high prevalence of LVH in hypertensive patients [6] . On the contrary, Successful lowering of the blood pressure into normal range has been identified to have a significant impact on LVH regression [26, 27] . Similar phenomenon was also observed among the diabetic patients. Prevalence of LVH in diabetic patients was identified to be higher than the general population [4, 28] , and latest randomized control test had demonstrated the value of glucose-lowering drugs for the regression of LVH in diabetic patients [29] , the plausible mechanism for this regression may be weight loss, improved insulin sensitivity, reduced blood pressure and ventricular load caused by glucose-lowering drugs. Meanwhile, aortic stiffness is another product of the persistent injury from multiple cardiovascular risk factors. The dominant risk factors for aortic stiffness were also hypertension and diabetes [30] [31] [32] [33] . Accordingly, LVH and aortic stiffness may share similar pathophysiological etiology. Hence, scientists began to investigate the association between aortic stiffness and LVH, and the results showed significant association between markers of aortic stiffness and LVH [11] [12] [13] . However, the quantification of all the markers of aortic stiffness used in previous studies require expensive and specialized equipment, which is rarely equipped in the primary care condition. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a simple, rapid, and cost-effective surrogate to assess the severity of aortic stiffness. The newly proposed ePWV meets the demand, previous research had demonstrated the accuracy of ePWV in assessing the severity of aortic stiffness [16] . According to the above information, we hypothesized that ePWV is associated with the LVH prevalence and may improve the identification of LVH prevalence in the general population.",

Additionally, the results from smooth spline analysis displayed that the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence was linear in the whole range of ePWV. Therefore, the risk of LVH prevalence may increase proportionally with the increment of ePWV, suggesting the potential of ePWV as a linear indicator to estimate the risk of LVH prevalence.

The results showed that there is no interaction between sex, obesity and diabetes and the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence, implicating that our major findings were robust to sex, obesity and diabetes, and the impact of ePWV on LVH prevalence was consistent in these subpopulations. However, in age and hypertension strata, there was a significant interaction between the stratifying variate and the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence. In the age strata, subjects aged less than 55 years old had a higher OR toward LVH prevalence than subjects aged equal to or more than 55 years old (3.430 vs. 2.126, p for interaction < 0.001), suggesting the younger population was more vulnerable to the increase of ePWV and the underlying aortic stiffness. In the hypertension strata, participants with hypertension had a significantly higher OR value than participants with normal blood pressure (2.577 vs. 1.922, p for interaction < 0.001), implicating that hypertension and aortic stiffness may act synergistically towards the development and progression of LVH. In general, the results of subgroup analysis suggest that the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence was consistent in sex, obesity, and diabetes strata, and for younger population and hypertensive patients, the increase of ePWV may cast more risk for LVH prevalence than their corresponding counterpart, therefore these subpopulations may deserve more attention and monitoring than the general population to prevent LVH development and progression.",

Therefore, we believe the possibility that subjects with high physical activity and LVH present with a normal, physiological response to regular exercise is low. To confirm our hypothesis, we also conducted a cross-table for physical activity and LV geometry (Additional file 1: Table S2 ), the results showed high physical activity cast marginal influence on the LV geometry.",

Among the 1753 subjects who received anti-hypertensive therapy, 603 (34.40%) had LVH, higher than that in the total population (14.56%) and that in all HTN patients (23.31%). It is worthy to mention that the HTN control rate among our HTN patients was only 5.97% (n = 354), even if 1753 (29.59%) of the HTN patients were using anti-hypertensive therapy. Among those with controlled HTN, the prevalence of LVH was 20.62% (n = 73), lower than that in all hypertensive patients but still higher than that in the total population. We employed logistic regression to assess the association between ePWV and prevalence of LVH in subjects with controlled HTN. However, due to the low rate of controlled HTN, the logistic regression in this subgroup was extremely lack of statistical power. Based on above data, we believe our results cannot answer whether ePWV can detect the impact of lowering blood pressure on LVH regression, further studies focusing on this topic are needed.",

Although significantly better than MBP alone, ePWV itself still had limited value to identify LVH prevalence. Nevertheless, a significant improvement for the identification of LVH prevalence was observed when adding ePWV into cardiovascular risk factors (0.787 vs. 0.810, p for comparison < 0.001). However, as the most widespread method to investigate a new marker, ROC analysis still has its drawbacks. Published article has revealed the insensitivity of ROC analysis to detect the value of a new marker for improving the identification of diseases [35] . ROC analysis can compare the identifying ability of two models, but AUC cannot give an appropriate answer about whether adding a new marker into existed risk factors can optimize the accuracy of disease identification [36] . Hence, depending on ROC analysis alone may underestimate the value of a new marker. Based on above information, statisticians have proposed reclassification analysis (including IDI and NRI) to assess the incremental impact of adding a new marker to established risk factors for disease identification [37] [38] [39] . As both NRI and IDI were significant, our findings from the reclassification analysis support the significant incremental value of ePWV to optimize the identification of LVH prevalence. Accordingly, both ROC analysis and reclassification analysis suggest the usefulness of ePWV to improve the identification of people with high risk of LVH prevalence. Through introducing ePWV into primary care settings, clinicians would have more objective evidence to achieve early identification of LVH prevalence and then make appropriate clinical decisions. In general, our findings implicate the incremental value of ePWV to improve the identification of LVH prevalence in the general population.",

Mechanical fatigue and fragmentation of elastin fibers cause dilatation of the aorta. Therefore, the pressure load is transferred to the stiffer elements of the aortic wall, such as collagen. The consequence of this pathophysiological change is the increment of aortic wall stiffness and pulse wave velocity, and then results in that the reflected pressure waves will arrive at late systolic phase rather than diastolic phase [40] . Hence, the systolic pressure will increase and thereby augment the afterload of left ventricle [41, 42] . Eventually, long-term persistent increase of the afterload of left ventricle will lead to LVH.",

Firstly, our current work only used cross-sectional data of the survey, follow-up data was unavailable because the follow-up work was delayed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the data of our work can only suggest the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence, the longitudinal association between ePWV and the development and progression of LVH still needs prospective studies to explore. Secondly, our subjects were sampled from the natural population in the southeastern China. Hence, our findings from the current data may not be applicable for people from different areas or countries with diverse race and socioeconomic conditions. Thirdly and lastly, as the same with other observational research, unrecorded variates can also cause residual confounding and thereby bring bias into our analysis. For example, the echocardiography in our survey could only provide cardiac chamber parameters. Therefore, we could not add valvular heart diseases such as aortic stenosis into our analysis. To address this disadvantage, more studies with more detailed information collection are needed to verify the association between ePWV and the LVH prevalence. Lastly, although NRI and IDI are novel and interesting statistical methods for investigating the capacity of new markers to improve the prediction and identification of outcomes, they still have limitations. They are both composite scores that include reclassification of risk in both an upwards and a downwards direction. Therefore, they cannot provide information about the specific direction of reclassification, and they have relatively high false positive rate to detect the significant value of new markers. Furthermore, although IDI was significant in our current work, it was low. Hence, more studies evaluating the association between ePWV and LVH prevalence in different populations are needed in future.",

Moreover, our findings revealed the incremental value of ePWV to optimize the identification of LVH prevalence in the general population, implicating ePWV may serve as a simple and cost-effective marker to improve the early identification and prevention of LVH.",
