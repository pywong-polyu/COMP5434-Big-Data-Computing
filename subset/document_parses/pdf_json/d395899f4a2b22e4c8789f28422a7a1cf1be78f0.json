Genetic susceptibility to AS is mainly due to the presence of the HLA-B*27 (B27) allele, and endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase-1 (ERAP-1) plays a key role in antigen processing and presentation to HLA class I molecules. Tobacco consumption is one of the main environmental factors involved in the pathogenesis of various diseases, including AS. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the association and the interactive effects of variants of the ERAP1 gene with smoking in modulating the risk of AS.",

The association of two functional variants of the ERAP1 gene (rs30187 and rs27044) in patients with AS was analyzed by the allelic discrimination method using TaqMan probes. B27 was typified by PCR-SSP. The interaction between the variants of ERAP1 and B27 and smoking was assessed using the multifactorial dimensionality reduction (MDR) method. There was no significant association of the two variants of ERAP1 in the cases compared with the controls (P > 0.05); however, a strong interaction between the variants and smoking could be demonstrated, with entropy values of 4.97% for rs30187 and 5.13% for rs27044. In addition, these interaction effects were increased in patients carrying the B27 allele. Conclusions The rs30187 and rs27044 variants of the ERAP1 gene appear to potentiate the effect of smoking in patients with AS carrying the B27 allele.",

Seronegative SpAs are those that lack rheumatoid factor or anti-nuclear antibodies in serum, including AS, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis and spondylitis associated with nonspecific inflammatory bowel diseases [1] [2] [3] . AS is characterized by inflammation of the peripheral and sacroiliac joints of the axial skeleton, and in some cases, it can cause enthesitis, pain in the area where a tendon, muscle or ligament inserts into bone. Later in the course of the disease, pain and stiffness appear in the lumbar back and hips. Within the natural history of the disease, fusion of vertebrae (ankylosis) is common, causing loss of flexibility and forward bending of the spine. Epidemiological data indicate that AS occurs in one per 200 individuals, and both the incidence and prevalence of AS in the general population depend on the frequency of occurrence of the B27 allele. It is estimated that between 0.5 and 1.0% of carriers of this marker in any population have the disease; in Mexico, it is estimated that the prevalence of AS is 0.09%. This disease affects men more than women at a 5:1 ratio, and the first symptoms appear between the second and third decades of life [4] [5] [6] .",

Although 90% of patients with AS are carriers of the HLA-B*27 (B27) allele, only 1% to 5% of B27-positive people will develop AS, which indicates that genes other than B27 may play important roles in its etiology [7] . In this sense, recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified approximately 40 genes involved in AS, the most consistent of which is endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 (ERAP1), which can contribute to up to 26% of the genetic susceptibility to AS. In fact, ERAP1 is considered the second most important gene after B27 in the pathogenesis of AS, although its seems to occur only in B27-positive patients [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

Sixty-five men and women who declared that they were in good health, without symptoms suggestive of disease and without a family history of AS, were selected as healthy controls; they were patients' companions, blood bank donors and personnel from the Human Resources and Human Communication Departments of the INR-LGII. This study was conducted under the criteria established in the Declaration of Helsinki and was derived from a protocol with registration number INR-51/19, which was approved by the Ethics and Research Committee of the INR-LGII.",

MDR is a data mining strategy for detecting and characterizing nonlinear interactions among discrete attributes (e.g. SNPs, smoking, gender) that are predictive of a discrete outcome (e.g. case-control status, outcome, etc.). It combines attribute selection, attribute construction and classification with cross-validation to provide a powerful approach to modeling interactions. The best n-factor interaction model in predicting AS risk was identified with the maximum cross-validation consistency (CVC) and the optimal testing accuracy. An interaction map was prepared to show the interaction of individual factors in the best predictive model through information gain values (entropy percentage).",

With respect to AS, clinical studies indicate that tobacco use is associated with erectile dysfunction, cardiovascular risk, significant changes in acute phase reactants, systemic inflammation and decreased physical activity [28] [29] [30] . In addition, patients with AS who smoke experience increased pain and fatigue, leading to a poor quality of life [31] . It has been shown that the interaction between genetic and environmental factors, such as tobacco smoke, is crucial for the development of RA and OA [32, 33] . In the present study, we analyzed both the association of polymorphisms of the ERAP1 gene with AS and the effects of their interaction with smoking on the risk of developing AS. Our results showed that, despite the great representativeness of the MAF of the two variants of ERAP1 that were analyzed in our population, there was no significant association with the genetic susceptibility to AS. Several studies have been conducted to examine the association between SNPs of the ERAP1 gene and AS, and the results are inconsistent. Some argue that the association with ERAP1 occurs only in B27-positive patients, which suggests that there could be an epistatic gene-gene interaction [11, 22, 34] . Recently, it was discovered that ERAP1 variants interact genetically with the B27 and B*4001 alleles in patients with AS, indicating that ERAP1 risk variants can be present in both B27-positive and B27-negative/B*4001-positive patients [35] . However, other reports show that there is no association with ERAP1 in either B27-positive or B27-negative patients [36] . A study conducted in patients of Australian origin with AS, whether B27 positive or B27 negative, in the presence of risk or protective ERAP1 variants did not show significant differences in the expression of ER stress markers or proinflammatory cytokines [37] . Apparently, the association with B27 in patients with AS occurs mainly in populations of European Caucasian origin and is present at a very low or almost null frequency in populations of Asian origin [38] . It is possible that epistatic mechanisms are closely related to the genetic structure of populations in such a way that the interaction between ERAP1 and B27 may differ among them and that they may therefore manifest very particular phenotypes.",

Another important factor that alters the enzymatic activity of ERAP-1 is the presence of heavy metals, such as Cd, in tobacco smoke. A possible mechanism for the involvement of Cd in ERAP-1 enzymatic activity is that because it is an enzyme that depends on Zn 2+ and Cd 2+ having the same valence, its biological actions are described as ionic mimicry of Zn 2+ , and it may even compete with Zn 2+ for the same target site [41] since they use the same transport mechanisms for entry and for the regulation of cellular homeostasis [42] .",

Our results revealed interactions with a high degree of synergy between smoking and the ERAP1 variants, as well as a discrete epistatic interaction between . The presence of B27 increases the interactive effects between smoking and ERAP1 polymorphisms rs30187 and rs27044. Age and sex play important roles in the development of AS, and through the MDR method, we were able to corroborate this finding due to the strong interaction observed between these two variables (Fig. 1) . Overall, the best interaction model we obtained was for the interaction between B27, smoking, rs30187 and rs27044 (Table 3 ). Subsequently, we performed a conditioned analysis to determine the effect of B27 on the interaction of smoking with the two variants of ERAP1. Interestingly, the presence of B27 increases the entropy (or interaction) between smoking and the two variants (Fig. 2) . Each of these variables exerts an individual effect, and as they are added, the risk of developing AS increases. B27 is the most important factor in genetic susceptibility to AS, but we confirmed that other factors, such as the ERAP1 gene and smoking, act synergistically, enhancing the risk.",

We decided to perform an analysis of the interaction between all of the variables to highlight each of the individual effects; however, we are aware of the limitations of our work. First, the sample size was small because during the recruitment period, there was limited access of the population to medical services at our institution due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which affects the statistical power, so the results must be taken with caution. Second, our study focused on a single population sampled from a single hospital, and therefore, it would be worthwhile to replicate the study with a multicenter sample to corroborate our findings. Third, there are numerous SNPs within the ERAP1 gene and other genes (such as those in the IL-23 pathway, KIRs and TLR4, among others) that were not considered but impact the modulation of AS. Finally, it is possible that, in addition to Cd, the lead, arsenic and chromium present in tobacco smoke could favor the development of AS; however, these elements were not considered.",
