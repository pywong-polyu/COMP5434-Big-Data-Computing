A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t Abstract Background. Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging serious global health problem. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in COVID-19 patients, and SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in stool specimens. However, the relationship between the gut microbiome and disease remains to be established. Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 30 COVID-19 patients, 24 influenza A (H1N1) patients, and 30 matched healthy controls (HC) to identify differences in the gut microbiota by 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene V3-V4 region sequencing. Results. Compared with HC, COVID-19 patients had significantly reduced bacterial diversity, a significantly higher relative abundance of opportunistic pathogens, such as Streptococcus, Rothia, Veillonella and Actinomyces, and a lower relative abundance of beneficial symbionts. Five biomarkers showed high accuracy for distinguishing COVID-19 patients from HC with an area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.89. Patients with H1N1 displayed lower diversity and different overall microbial composition compared with COVID-19 patients. Seven biomarkers were selected to distinguish the two cohorts with an AUC of 0.94.",

The clinical manifestations and transmission routes of seasonal influenza A (H1N1) are similar to those of COVID-19 [2, 3] . WHO reported that the prevalence of influenza and influenza-like illness were high in China and the United States in the 2019-2020 season [4] . Distinguishing COVID-19 and H1N1 at the early stage of outbreaks is essential because occupational safety measures, treatment, and prognosis are different between these entities. SARS-CoV-2 binds to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors to invade human cells, and these receptors are highly expressed in the intestinal epithelium [5] . ACE2 might be associated with cardiopulmonary disease via alterations in the gut and/or lung microbiomes [6] . Previous studies have found that 3.34-11.4% of COVID-19 patients had gastrointestinal symptoms, such as vomiting and diarrhea, especially in critically ill patients [7, 8] . Moreover, viral RNA and live viruses were detected in fecal samples, suggesting that the digestive tract might be a site of viral replication and activity [9] . However, the interaction between COVID-19 and intestinal microorganisms is not fully understood.",

Studies have identified SARS-CoV-2 RNA in stool specimens of infected patients [9] , and RNA analysis demonstrated that the duration of viral shedding from stool was longer than that from respiratory samples [32] . In addition, host ACE2 receptors are highly expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelium [7] . SARS-CoV-2 may interfere with nutrient absorption by binding to ACE2 receptors, causing gastroenteritis-like symptoms, and disrupting intestinal homeostasis. ",

Previous studies have demonstrated the importance of BPB, which may be involved in the inflammatory mechanism of viral pneumonia[33, 34]. Studies showed that a high-fiber diet increased the production of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), enhanced antiviral CD8 + T cell immune response virus infection, and attenuated neutrophil-mediated lung injury, consequently improving survival[15, 35]. In turn, significantly reduced levels of BPB and other commensal bacteria with important physiological functions may promote the overgrowth of intestinal conditional pathogenic bacteria and increase both intestinal mucosal permeability and endotoxin concentrations in the blood, ultimately triggering inflammation, which exacerbates cytokine release[36, 37]. Several limitations of this study should be mentioned. Firstly, this was a single-center, cross-sectional study, with small sample size. Variations among patients at different disease stages of COVID-19 and H1N1 have not been evaluated. Secondly, although the participants were matched for age, sex ratio and BMI, gut microbiota can be influenced by other variables, such as diet and lifestyle parameters. Thirdly, while the changes observed in our study are obvious and reproducible, a mechanism that linked viral lung infection with changes in the gut microbiota was not identified. In summary, we identified significant changes in gut microbial communities in COVID-19 and H1N1 patients and relevant biomarkers of these diseases. Moreover, there were significant changes in the structure and composition of the gut microbiome between these study groups. Specific microbial biomarkers of COVID-19 and H1N1 patients were identified and were correlated with clinical indexes. Notwithstanding, microbial signatures in COVID-19 and H1N1 patients need to be validated in larger cohorts, including subgroups at different stages of the disease.

The COVID-19 patients were admitted to the First Affiliated Hospital of the Zhejiang University School of Medicine between January 2020 and March 2020. Disease severity was classified into four types according to the diagnostic criteria of the seventh edition of the Diagnostic and Treatment Protocol for COVID-19 in China[17], and our cohort presented either (1) general disease, characterized by fever, respiratory symptoms, and lung imaging evidence of pneumonia; or (2) severe disease, manifested by a respiratory rate (RR) \u226530 per min, oxygen saturation \u2264 93% at rest, arterial partial pressure of oxygen (PaO2)/fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) \u2264300 mmHg, or progression (>50%) in lung imaging lesions within 24-48 h. H1N1 patients hospitalized from January 2018 to March 2019 were enrolled.

At the phylum level, the relative abundance of phyla Actinobacteria and Firmicutes significantly decreased in the H1N1 group compared with the COVID-19 group and HC, which was largely due to a significant reduction in class Actinobacteria, Erysipelotrichia, and Clostridia. At the family level, the amount of several representative groups of putative anaerobic butyrate-producing bacteria (BPB) from the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae was dramatically decreased in H1N1 patients. This result was partly due to significant depletion in the abundance of Blautia, Agathobacter, Anaerostipes, Fusicatenibacter, Eubacterium hallii group, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, Dorea, Faecalibacterium, and Ruminococcus-2 in the H1N1 group. Similarly, compared with HC, the abundance of the Ruminococcaceae family and several genera from the Lachnospiraceae family (Fusicatenibacter, Anaerostipes, Agathobacter, unclassified Lachnospiraceae, and Eubacterium hallii group) was dramatically reduced in COVID-19 patients.
