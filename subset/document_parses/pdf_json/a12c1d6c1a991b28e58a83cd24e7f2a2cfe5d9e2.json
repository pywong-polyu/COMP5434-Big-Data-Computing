The longer the time span, the higher the likelihood that the model parameters have changed as a result of major disruptive events, such as the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 outbreak. Detecting the existence of breaks, and dating them is therefore necessary not only for estimation purposes but also for understanding drivers of change and their effect on relationships. This article introduces a new community contributed command called xtbreak, which provides researchers with a complete toolbox for analysing multiple structural breaks in time series and panel data. xtbreak can detect the existence of breaks, determine their number and location, and provide break date confidence intervals. The new command is used to explore changes in the relationship between COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US using both country-level time series data and state-level panel data.",

To investigate such relationships, observations over time for one or more cross-sectional units such as firms, individuals, or countries are collected and are subsequently used in estimating the coefficients of regression models. A key assumption here is that the coefficients do not change over time. This assumption is unlikely to hold, especially for longer periods of time, because of major disruptive events, such as financial crises. Parameter instability can have a detrimental impact on estimation and inference, and can lead to costly errors in decision-making. The times in which the parameters change are called \"change points\" in the statistics literature and \"structural breaks\" in economics. As both terms are synonymous to each other, in the following we will use the latter term or just \"breaks\".",

(2021) in the case of panel data. 2 xtbreak provides researchers with a complete toolbox for analysing multiple structural breaks in time series and panel data. It can detect and date an unknown number of breaks at unknown break dates. The toolbox is based on asymptotically valid tests for the presence of breaks, a consistent break date estimator, and a break date confidence interval with correct asymptotic coverage. In fact, xtbreak includes no less than three tests; (i) a test of no structural change against the alternative of a specific number of changes, (ii) a test the null hypothesis of no structural change against the alternative of an unknown number of structural changes, and (iii) a test of the null of s changes against the alternative of s + 1 changes. The package also includes an algorithm that employs the last test consecutively in order to estimate the true number of breaks. The tested break dates can be unknown or user-defined, as when researchers have additional information and wish to examine whether there was a break in a specific point in time.",

To showcase this width, we consider as an example the epidemiological relationship between COVID-19 cases and deaths.

In total, xtbreak supports five different models depending on this specification. There are presented in Table 1 The choice of deterministic model has implications for the structural break analysis. In the constant-only model, the constant is treated as a regular regressor and we can test and detect breaks in it. In fact, the constant may be the only regressor. With fixed effects, xtbreak cannot consider a model without breaking regressors (w i,t ) and it cannot detect or estimate breaks that affect only the fixed effects and not the regressors.

The number of breaks is increased by one every time the test is able to reject the null, starting at 0 breaks. We see that 0 breaks is rejected in favour of at least 1 break and that 1 break 9. The maximum permissible number of breaks depends on the minimal length of the subsamples considered, and hence on the trimming parameter . The maximum number of breaks is given by the formula 1/ \u22122, where \u00b7 is the smallest greater integer function.

According to Figure 2 , the end date of this regime coincides with the end of the first wave. This estimate is quite high, which can be explained by the relatively small number of tests conducted at that time. The estimated effect of the number of cases is much lower in the second regime, which stretches week 21 of 2020 to week 10 of 2021. Only 14 out of an additional 1,000 infected died. In the third and last regime, which starts in week 11 of 2021, the estimated effect reduces even further, to 6 deaths per 1,000 infected.

The command can be applied to time series and panel data, and can hence be seen as a complete break detection toolbox that is applicable regardless of the structure of the data. In our empirical illustration, we employ US country and state level date to investigate the relationship between the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths, which may well have changed as a result of improvements in testing capacity, reporting routines and treatments. While the time series data set suggests 2 breaks, the panel data set suggests 3. Moreover, 2 out of the 3 breaks detected using the panel data set coincide with those detected using the time series data set. Use of the relatively larger panel data therefore leads to the detection of an additional break that is not detected when using the time series data set.",
