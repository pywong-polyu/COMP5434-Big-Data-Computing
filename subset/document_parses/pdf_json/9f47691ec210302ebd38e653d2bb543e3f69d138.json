A COVID-19 diagnostic test is advisable for individuals experiencing COVID-19 symptoms or those exposed to persons with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 illness [1, 2] . The COVID-19 test is also advised for travel purposes, recreation, social gatherings and professional meetings, or can be enforced at the workplace by employers [3] . Patients with a confirmed COVID-19 infection develop fever and/or acute respiratory illness which may lead to death [2] . Timely test results help provide informed recommendations to the patient, thereby protecting the front-line workers and limiting the COVID-19 transmission to others in close contact [4, 5] .",

            "text": "The FDA has granted Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) to several in vitro diagnostic tests for SARS-CoV-2 [6] . These IVD tests are grouped into three categories \u2212 diagnostic tests (i.e., molecular tests and 'rapid' antigen tests), serology or antibody tests, and tests for the management of COVID-19 patients depending on their suitability to detect the disease parameters from the onset of symptoms ( Figure 1 ) [10, 11, 13] . The first type of IVD tests are diagnostic tests that detect parts of the SARS-CoV-2 virus for the diagnosis of active COVID-19 infection (i.e., where there is active shedding of the virus). The samples for diagnostic tests are collected using a nasal or throat swab, or from saliva by spitting into a tube. Sometimes, secretions from the lower respiratory tract, such as sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, are also used for confirmatory tests [7] . The second type of IVD tests are serology or antibody tests that measure the presence of antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from serum, plasma or whole blood from finger stick or veins. The detected antibodies are indicative of previous exposure to the virus or immune status of the individual. The third type of IVD tests evaluate the severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection, typically by measuring the levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in serum, plasma or whole blood [11] . The FDA's In Vitro Diagnostics EUAs website provides a list of companies whose COVID-19 test kits have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) [6] . At the time of this publication, there were roughly 243 entries for authorized SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic tests, 79 entries for authorized SARS-CoV-2 serology or antibody tests, and 3 entries for authorized in vitro diagnostic tests for the management of COVID-19 patients. In this review, we primarily focus on these COVID-19 test kits granted FDA EUA. On a cautionary note, IVD tests are not suitable for COVID-19 patients showing emergency warning signs, such as \"breathing difficulty, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, inability to wake up or stay awake, new confusion, and bluish lips or face\" [3] .",

For instance, the FDA allows any new developer to leverage the data from previous EUA-authorized assays by submitting a right of reference from the sponsor. By doing so, new developers can leverage the CDC's in silico and cross reactivity tests, rather than repeating the tests on their assays. As an example, the CDC has granted the right of reference for its CDC 2019-nCoV Real-Time RT-PCR Diagnostic Panel and Influenza SARS-CoV-2 (Flu SC2) Multiplex Assay to any entity seeking an FDA EUA for a COVID-19 diagnostic device or developing a multi-analyte respiratory panel including SARS-CoV-2 [6] .",

A false negative COVID-19 test result has the risks of delayed medical and supportive treatment for the infected person while giving a false sense of security [14] . False negative results may result in skipping to monitor the close contacts of the infected person for disease symptoms, which can lead to increased transmission risks. Besides the performance parameters, the manufacturers are also expected to report other details of their testing protocol, such as the sample type, intended setting and population groups, standard operating procedure, instructions for use, associated equipment and consumables to perform the test, turnaround time, sample disposal procedure, training requirements, and potential risks to the user and health personnel [4] .",

            "text": "There are benefits of using saliva samples over nasal or throat swabs for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure 6 ) [26] . Saliva collection is contactless and poses a reduced risk to the healthcare worker. Saliva collection is less invasive than swab insertions and contributes to lower consumption of personal protective equipment (PPE) and nasal swabs. Saliva testing can be made easily accessible as at-home tests for patients at increased risks, sick patients, or patients in quarantine. However, the SARS-CoV-2 RNA in saliva specimens is only detectable during the acute phase of infection [27, 28] . Positive test results from saliva specimens would suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA is present but may not rule out infections from bacteria or other viruses. Negative results from saliva specimens may not rule out SARS-CoV-2 infection and must be confirmed with alternate specimens and testing methods [26] . At-home saliva collection kits from Spectrum Solution and Infinity BiologiX (IBX) are often used for collecting, maintaining, and preserving saliva samples [26] . The Spectrum Solution's SDNA-1000 Saliva Collection Device is intended to collect the saliva specimen in a plastic 6 mL tube with the aid of a funnel (Figure 7 ) [27] . Then, the stabilizing solution, housed in its fluid chamber, is mixed with the saliva specimen. The SDNA-1000 preservation agent inactivates the virus and renders the saliva specimen non-infectious, while preserving the stability of viral RNA for over 14 days at room temperature. In April 2020, Infinity BiologiX (IBX, formerly called the Rutgers RUCDR Infinite Biologics) received the first FDA Emergency Use Authorization for its saliva tests to detect the SARS-CoV-2 using RT-PCR test [26] . The company received a revised EUA for at-home saliva sample collection using its IBX Saliva Collection Kit (Figure 8 ) or the Spectrum Solution's SDNA-1000 Saliva Collection Device [29] . The saliva samples are shipped to an IBX laboratory for storage, purification of genetic material, PCR amplification of extracted RNA, and quality control checks. IBX acts as a service provider for organizations that have large volume testing needs where the subsequent processing of saliva samples is conducted at IBX laboratories (Figure 8) . IBX does not process individual tests, but has partnered with service providers such as VaultHealth, 1health.io, ixlayer, and US Drug Test Centers.",

These tests are suited in settings where timely access to RT-PCR tests is difficult or when immediate patient care decisions must be made.

We highlight these differences with the products from the following manufacturers: Ellume, Innova, Everlywell and Access Bio. Ellume has developed a fully at-home diagnostic self-test kit for COVID-19 [31] . The Ellume COVID-19 Home Test involves self-collecting a mid-turbinate nasal swab and plugging it into an analyzer. The analyzed data is transmitted to a smartphone application to display and interpret the results. The test takes 15 min to generate a result and is suitable for individuals 2 years of age and older. In individuals with COVID-19 symptoms, the Ellume test correctly identified 96% of positive samples and 100% of negative samples. In individuals without COVID-19 symptoms, the Ellume test correctly identified 91% of positive samples and 96% of negative samples. The FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization to the Ellume technology as the first over-the-counter COVID-19 diagnostic test that can be conducted completely at home [32] . The FDA allows the test kit to be sold in drug stores for non-prescription use. In December 2020, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) awarded a $30 million grant for delivering 20 million Ellume COVID-19 Home Tests to the United States [33] . In February 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services awarded $230 million dollars (USD) to Ellume to scale up their manufacturing of at-home testing kits to around 19 million kits every month by the end of this year [34] . These funds, given through the US Health Care Enhancement Act (HCEA), will enable Ellume to ship out around 100,000 test kits each month from February to July and construct a new production plant in the US [34, 35] . The Innova SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Qualitative Test uses a swab to collect the specimen from nostrils or throat [36] . The swab is put in a tube with the extraction fluid. A small amount of the extraction fluid is placed in the sample well of the Lateral Flow Device (LFD) testing cartridge to perform colloidal gold immunochromatography for the detection of nucleocapsid antigens from SARS-CoV-2 [37] . The result is obtained within [38] . A study reviewed 8774 Innova tests conducted across different groups, including COVID-19 patients, healthcare workers, armed forces personnel, and students [38] . The overall sensitivity was 76.8%, which rose to over 95% in participants with high viral loads. The overall specificity was 99.68% with a low false positive rate (i.e., 22 out of 6967 tests).",

The FebriDx system consists of a lateral flow device into which 5 \u00b5L blood is drawn by capillary action and the reagents are released by pressing a button. After 10 min, the results are visually inspected in the form of three lines: the CRP line, the MxA line, and the control line. Elevated MxA levels are indicative of viral infections. A clinical study assessed the accuracy of FebriDx in detecting MxA within 251 hospitalized adults suspected of COVID-19 [41] . FebriDx had a sensitivity of 93% (110/118) and a specificity of 86% (112/130) [41] . The study concluded that FebriDx had a high accuracy and could be deployed as a front door triage test.",

            "text": "These tests measure the levels of antibodies (such as immunoglobulins IgG, IgM or total antibodies in blood) to SARS-CoV-2 [11] . Blood samples for antibody tests are collected from finger stick or by a healthcare personnel at a clinic or pharmacy, and the results are obtained within 1 to 3 days. In most individuals, seroconversion may happen within 7 to 11 days after exposure to the virus, and IgG and IgM titers may plateau within 6 days of seroconversion [7, 50] . A study of 338 patients recruited from Tongji Hospital (Wuhan, China) found that IgM levels increased in the first week and peaked in the second week [51] . The IgG levels increased after first week and stayed high for a longer period. The study had used a chemiluminescence immunoassay by YHLO Biotech [51] . As such, the serology or antibody tests provide historical information about exposure to the virus, but they cannot diagnose cases of COVID-19 active infection or acute illness. However, antibodies can take days or weeks to develop after an infection and can stay in the bloodstream after several weeks of recovery. The tests also cannot explicitly tell whether neutralizing antibodies are present (i.e., the ones that protect the individual from the virus) or how long this protective immunity is bestowed against the virus. Antibody tests are helpful to determine the prevalence of COVID-19 in individuals, such as to identify those who are at the risk of COVID-19 infection or those who may be potential donors of convalescent plasma for COVID-19 treatment [13] . A list of the serology or antibody test kits granted FDA EUA is shown in Table 4 . We describe the differences in commercialized antibody test kits with some examples, namely Cellex, Bio-Rad, DiaSorin, Vibrant America, Lumos Dignostics, Quest Diagnostics, Scanwell Health, and Vanguard Diagnostics. The Cellex qSARS-CoV-2 IgG/IgM Rapid Test detects IgG and IgM antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 from serum, plasma, or venipuncture whole blood [52] . The specimen is dropped within a sample well with a sample diluent. The lateral flow test device produces a result within 20 min without the need for a reader or lab equipment. The Cellex assay is meant for prescription use only and is suitable as for self-contained, point-of-care (POC) tests [52] . Bio-Rad's Platelia SARS-CoV-2 Total Ab Assay detects the three antibodies (IgM, IgA, and IgG) for SARS-CoV-2 in a single test [53] . It uses a 1-step ELISA antigen capture with an incubation time of 90 min. DiaSorin's LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG is a chemiluminescent immunoassay (CLIA) intended for the qualitative detection of IgG antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 in human serum and plasma [54] . Vibrant America received the first FDA Emergency Use Authorization for its test panel to detect COVID-19 antibodies from dried blood spots [55] . The Vibrant COVID-19 Ab Assay is a chemiluminescence immunoassay intended for the qualitative detection and differentiation of IgM and IgG antibodies against 4 COVID-19 antigens in human serum or dried blood spot. The turnaround time is between 24 to 36 h from the receipt of sample. This test cannot be directly ordered by the patients and is not permitted for at-home testing but is available only at the doctor's office [55] .",

For instance, there are in vitro diagnostic tests for the quantitative measurement of interleukin-6 (IL-6) in human serum and plasma as described in Table 5 . Because an elevated level of IL-6 is indicative of systemic inflammation, these assays help in identifying severe inflammatory response in patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection. As a note, severe inflammatory response (also referred to as the \"cytokine release syndrome\" (CRS) or \"cytokine storm\") occurs in less than 20% of COVID-19 patients with symptoms such as fever, hypotension, dyspnea, organ dysfunction, and organ failure [59] . An elevated IL-6 is also an inflammatory signature in COVID-19 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Besides identifying severe inflammatory response in COVID-19 patients, these immunoassays help in determining the risks of intubation with mechanical ventilations (e.g., using a cutoff of 35 pg/mL in confirmed COVD-19 patients at presentation). On a cautionary note, the IL-6 levels obtained from these immunoassays should not be solely used to make patient management decisions but used in conjunction with other clinical findings, laboratory test results, patient history and epidemiological information [60, 61] .",

Beckman Coulter's Access IL-6 assay is a simultaneous, one-step immuno-enzymatic assay to be used with Access immunoassay analyzers such as Access 2, Dxl 600, and Dxl 800 [60] . A sample is added to a reaction vessel containing paramagnetic particles coated with mouse anti-human IL-6, blocking reagent, and alkaline phosphatase conjugate. After incubation, a magnetic field holds the materials bound to the solid phase while the unbound materials are washed away. To the reaction vessel, a chemiluminescent substrate is added, and the generated light is proportional to the IL-6 concentration in the sample. The ADVIA Centaur IL-6 assay by Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics is a chemiluminescent immunoassay and is intended for use with the ADVIA Centaur XP, ADVIA Centaur XPT, and ADVIA Centaur CP systems [62] . The assay utilizes two reagents. The first Lite Reagent consists of monoclonal mouse anti-IL-6 antibody labelled with an ester in buffer. The second Solid Phase reagent consists of anti-IL-6 mouse monoclonal antibody coated paramagnetic microparticles in buffer. The sample is incubated with the two reagents to allow the formation of immune complexes. After incubation and washing, the ADVIA Centaur Acid Reagent and ADVIA Centaur Base Reagent are added to start the chemiluminescent reaction and generate light that is indicative of the amount of IL-6 in the sample.

            "text": "There are certain limitations of available COVID-19 test kits. Firstly, we need to address the high prices of COVID-19 testing while incorporating more functions and data insights [4, 7, 8] . Most commercial tests cost over $100 (USD) which is very expensive for the masses. One way to reduce the price of laboratory tests could be to develop simpler protocols for RT-PCR testing, for example, through circumventing the RNA extraction step and performing RT-PCR directly on heat-inactivated samples as shown in Figure 2 [19] . Secondly, existing tests are not able to determine whether an individual has an infectious virus (i.e., the virus that is capable of invading cells and reproducing to produce an infection) or measure the degree of infectiousness from the virus. The infectious virus may be present from 2 to 3 days before symptoms develop and up to 12 days after symptoms develop. Thirdly, current diagnostic assays are qualitative, and it would be informative to track the temporal profiles of viral loads during the course of an infection (e.g., asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases where viral levels may be subtle) [7, 65] . There are unanswered questions on how long the antibodies persist after COVID-19 infection and whether the antibodies confer protective immunity against the virus. Fourthly, most of the available COVID-19 test kits have not been rigorously tested and validated as compared to other medical tests that have been granted full approval from the FDA. For example, antibody testing should not solely be used to conclude a person is immune to the disease because of cross-reactivity and false positives, and other clinical information should be considered as part of a comprehensive testing plan in consultation with the physician. Lastly, it would be worthwhile to integrate the COVID-19 testing with epidemiologic or seroprevalence studies to help public authorities better characterize the COVID-19 spread or immunity within a community. For example, the Seattle Flu Study, initiated by the University of Washington, is providing free at-home testing for COVID-19 in the Greater Seattle area to track the spread of respiratory illnesses and whether everyday devices, such as the Apple Watch, can predict the COVID-19 illness [66] .",

A recent large-scale study compared the sensitivity of five antigen tests with RT-PCR tests for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in nasopharyngeal swabs of 1141 patients [65] . The five antigen test kits used in their stud67y were the Ecotest COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test (Assure Tech, Hangzhou, China), SARS-CoV-2 Antigen Rapid Test Kit (JoysBio Biotechnology, Tianjin, China), Immupass VivaDiag SARS-CoV-2 Ag Rapid Test (VivaChek Biotech, Hangzhou, China), Standard Q COVID-19 Ag (SD Biosensor, Chungcheongbuk-do, Republic of Korea ), and ND COVID-19 Ag test (NDFOS, Seoul, South Korea). An interesting outcome of this study was that the false negatives indicated by the antigen tests generally had very low levels of viable virus presence in the samples. The study suggested that most asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients who are missed by antigen tests (but are COVID-19 positive according to RT-PCR) are probably not infectious [65] . Another study compared the performance of a rapid SARS-CoV-2 antigen detection test, Standard Q COVID-19 Ag kit (SD Biosensor, Seoul, South Korea), with the real-time RT-PCR test, Allplex 2019-nCoV Assay (Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in 454 respiratory specimens (mainly nasopharyngeal and throat swabs) [68] . The study found that the rapid antigen assay, Standard Q COVID-19 Ag kit, had comparable accuracy (sensitivity and specificity) with the Allplex 2019-nCoV RT-PCR assay. Another study compared the performance of seven commercial RT-PCR diagnostic test kits identified from the FindDx website: Altona Diagnostics (Hamburg, Germany), BGI (Shenzhen, Guangdong, China), CerTest Biotec (Zaragoza, Spain), KH Medical (Gyeonggido, Republic of Korea), PrimerDesign (Southampton, United Kingdom), R-Biopharm AG (Darmstadt, Germany), and Seegene (Seoul, South Korea) [69] . This study found that the PCR efficiency in the selected RT-PCR diagnostic test kits was satisfactory (~96%) and the LOD95 was within a six-fold range (3.8 to 23 copies per mL). Future large-scale studies from international, scientific entities could convince everyone whether rapid antigen tests are a reasonable alternative to RT-PCR [65] .",

While RT-PCR test is considered the gold standard for COVID-19 testing, there is a reasonable case for rapid antigen assays as a low-cost, at-home, self-testing alternative. As more people are getting vaccinated or exposed to SARS-CoV-2, serology or antibody tests will continue to be important in determining the levels of antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 within different population groups. Today, existing technologies for IVD tests need to constantly improve to be effective against emerging and circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants. Future IVD tests could shine light on several key aspects of the COVID-19 infections, including the temporal profiles of viral loads (e.g., in mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic patients) and longevity of protective immunity provided by the antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. The information discussed in this work will continue to evolve over time as we learn more about different SARS-CoV-2 variants across the world-e it the variant of interest, variant of concern, or variant of high consequence. Finally, the cost associated with COVID-19 diagnostics is significantly high for mass-scale testing in developing and under-developed countries. While local governments and global health organizations are willing to bear a majority of the testing costs today, a sustainable COVID-19 testing model needs to be formulated in the near future that balances the cost, convenience, and quality of IVD tests.
