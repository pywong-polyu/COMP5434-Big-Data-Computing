The basic structure of STNN is similar to the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) incorporating with not only temporal data but also spatial features. Two improved STNN architectures, namely the STNN with Augmented Spatial States (STNN-A) and the STNN with Input Gate (STNN-I), are proposed, which ensure more predictability and flexibility. STNN and its variants can be trained using Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) algorithm and its improved variants (e.g., Adam, AdaGrad and RMSProp). Our STNN models are compared with several classical epidemic prediction models, including the fully-connected neural network (BPNN), and the recurrent neural network (RNN), the classical curve fitting models, as well as the SEIR dynamical system model. Numerical simulations demonstrate that STNN models outperform many others by providing more accurate fitting and prediction, and by handling both spatial and temporal data.",

The Chinese government reacted very quickly and made great effort to limit the spread of the disease. Numerous effective control measures have been implemented, including traffic control, travel limitation, mask wearing, social distancing, party cancellation, targeted isolation, environmental disinfection, work resumption delaying, and online working etc. As a result, the epidemic situation was effectively controlled in China. By mid-February, the peak of the daily active cases appeared and dropped rapidly, and the spread of the disease in China area was almost stopped by mid-April. Meanwhile, it was just the beginning of the worldwide situation. WHO reported in April 4 that over 1 million cases of COVID-19 had been confirmed worldwide, a more than tenfold increase in less than a month. Until January 2021, there are 95 millions cumulative cases and 2 million deaths worldwide. Several variants of COVID-19 appeared and some of them have stronger transmission capacity, e.g., SARS-CoV-2 outbreak in UK was estimated up to 70% more transmissible than the previously circulating forms (Kirby, 2021) .",

Hundreds of preprints are shared every day on the study of all aspects including biomedicine, epidemiology, economics, sociology, mathematics and computer sciences etc. Several reports, e.g., (Organization et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2020; Leung et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020a) , show that COVID-19 has a higher basic reproductive number R 0 and a lower death rate comparing to the other well-known two coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (SARS-CoV outbreak in 2002 caused more than 8000 infections and 800 deaths, and MERS-CoV outbreak in 2012 caused 2494 individuals and 858 deaths). Zhong's team analyzed in first the symptoms, latency and mortality of COVID-19 and emphasized the significance of early isolation (Guan et al., 2020) . Later, the impact of different factors has been studied, such as the temperature, human mobility and control measures etc., see e.g., (Lin et al., 2020; Chinazzi et al., 2020; Xie & Zhu, 2020; Kraemer et al., 2020) . With the spread of the pandemic to the whole world, the transmission dynamical models for different countries have been investigated, see e.g., (Phan et al., 2020; Mizumoto & Chowell, 2020; Fanelli & Piazza, 2020; Rockett et al., 2020; Giordano et al., 2020; Sarkar et al., 2020) .",

As a result, the convergence rate of SGD is of order O( 1 \u221a k ) for convex optimization problem, and O( 1 k ) for strongly convex optimization problem. These bounds cannot be improved unless extra conditions are assumed. However, training an STNN model is highly nonconvex, and the study of the convergence rate of SGD for a nonconvex optimization problem is still far from mutual. Some recent works (Khaled & Richt\u00e1rik, 2020; Lei et al., 2019; Gower et al., 2019) show that the optimal convergence rate for SGD to find \u03b5-stationary points of nonconvex optimization problems under the expected smoothness assumption is O(\u03b5 \u22124 ), and recover the optimal O(\u03b5 \u22121 ) if the Polyak-\u0141ojasiewicz condition is satisfied. Note that a training algorithm with super-linear convergence rate for machine learning is in general not expected, as (Bottou & Bousquet, 2008) argue that too fast convergence presumably corresponds to overfitting.",

The provincial data from January to March 2020 are used to test different models. The reason to choose this period is that the pandemic situation is very different, broke out in January, peaked in February, and reduced quickly in March. The spatial data for STNN model include the adjacency matrix of geographic locations, the average population migrations, and the distance matrix among 33 provinces. Temporal data is divided into 2 categories: training set (90%) and validation set (10%). The compared BPNN, GRU, curve fitting and SEIR models are fed with temporal data only. The STNN and GRU models are trained up to 10,000 epochs using Adam algorithm, where the observation, state and input networks have 1-3 layers with 10-30 neurons in each. The 2 regularization could be involved to avoid overfitting. The BPNN model is a 3 layered network with 5 neurons in the hidden layer and tanh as activation function, which is trained up to 1000 epochs 10 times using SGD with random initialization and the one with best performance is used. We apply the root mean square error (namely, RMSE) to measure the training and prediction errors for all tested models. The fitting and prediction results using COVID-19 data in China are summarized in Table 2 and illustrated in Figure 7 . Concerning global outbreaks outside of China, we choose two typical countries: USA and Italy. The fitting and prediction results are reported in Figure 8 ; the training and testing errors are summarized in Table 3 . The first 300 days of spatial and temporal data from 22 January to 31 December of 2020 are used to predict the peak of the next 15 days in Italy and the trend of continued growth over the next 30 days in USA. Comments on numerical results Numerical results demonstrate that the STNN-A, STNN-I and BPNN models often provide best fitting and prediction results (as shown in Figures 7 and 8 and in Tables 2 and 3 with boldface for smallest RMSE and underline for largest RMSE). The classical STNN, GRU, SEIR and polynomial models often perform well for both fitting and prediction of data in China and other countries, only slightly weaker in RMSE than the im- proved STNN models and BPNN model. The exponential model seems to perform bad for both fitting and prediction, even for unilateral cases, and not suitable to fit peaks; while BPNN, GRU, STNN and Gaussian models perform quite well to predict peaks. The major drawback of the SEIR model is the high dependence on the estimation of model parameters; the Gaussian model performs well for unilateral fitting and short period unilateral prediction, but not very satisfactory for long period unilateral prediction; the polynomial model works well for fitting within the data range, but diverges wildly for prediction beyond that range. As for our STNN models, the main advantage is the compatibility and the flexibility of using both temporal and spatial data to increase the accuracy (with small RMSE) of fitting and prediction; while its main drawback is also the requirement of many types (temporal and spatial) of data whose collection could be difficult and cumbersome. As plus, the training of deep neural networks (e.g., STNN and RNN) is very time and computing resource consuming comparing to the other models. Nevertheless, there is a need of large amounts of training data in many deep learning models, whose collection, in the current era of big data, is not too difficult. The increasing GPU computing power also makes it possible to train deep neural networks. Therefore, we believe that STNN should be a promising deep learning model in many potential applications involving spatial and temporal data.",
