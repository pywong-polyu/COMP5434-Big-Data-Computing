We understand that one of the major challenges the finance function is currently facing is the digital transformation, which many companies embrace as a do-or-die mantra. As a new set of skills is needed and new professions such as that of the data scientist emerge, the profession of the controller is increasingly questioned and challenged. The main question we examine is how the finance function, given its fundamental responsibilities, which we believe cannot change, will maneuver into new domains and into the unknown.",

Many of the companies that we talk to struggle to reduce the number of ERPs and to integrate them.

Clearly, they could use this time more effectively, for instance, by acting as business partners.

It has chosen to insource transactional activities from a supplier located in a low-cost country. In this case, the initiative was taken by a business unit without any formal coordination on the group level. Other companies with a centralized finance function have decided at a corporate level against developing RPAs, as the calculations were still in favor of external suppliers of transactional accounting. In contrast, a third company with a large number of internal and inter-company transactions clearly sees the benefits of investing in RPAs, one of the reasons being the general need to standardize processes and increase transparency internally. RPA investment patterns are thus dependent upon companies' technological infrastructure. For example, companies with a large number of routine transactions, as those active in the retail sector, it will be easier to build a business case around investing in automation.",

For example, one company active in the telecommunication industry tested whether human-or machine-based predictions deliver more accurate forecasts, with machines being the better forecaster. However, such attempts are still rare, and even the most advanced companies (those selling the systems) are struggling with their application. Many efforts aimed at digital transformation are still centered around ERP systems.

What is new is that the books are no longer expected to be closed within four to five days after the end of a month. New digital tools make the companies aim for zero days closing or even completely refrain from monthly reporting. It seems to be of great importance to them to always have the reports at their fingertips. They believe that this will facilitate quicker decision making and free up time for other tasks for their controllers. At the same time, they expect the reports, which were previously designed and made available by the controllers, to be available to every decision maker at any time. Hence, both business and financial controllers will need to find new and different tasks to conduct in the future.",

It will influence how fast and where decisions are made. Many of the companies we meet strive to speed up their decision making processes and, at the same time, free their controllers completely from spending time on generating and designing reports. However, in reality, many controllers still spend a substantial amount of their time on preparing and producing management reports and therefore have limited time to work as business partners. Often, they also have too little time for the communication and analysis of the reports. In consequence, decision making is not prepared for in the best possible way. Decisions may be taken more quickly, but may sometimes be the wrong ones. We therefore believe that decision making will not necessarily benefit from the increased speed. And we are not alone with our worries: Quattrone (2016) sees this as a potential negative effect of digitalization in organizations as well.",

Cloud-based ERP systems in combination with digital tools may make it easier for companies to be efficient and agile as well as centralized and decentralized at the same time. The controller needs to master an organization that has the capacity to be both home base oriented and organized around global hubs or centers of excellence, resembling what Hedlund (1986) described as heterarchical organizations. However, there are also dark sides of decentralized access to data, as it can be used to build alliances and mobilize relationships for political purposes (see also Hippke/Sch\u00e4ffer 2018) when it is available for actors who previously did not have access to it.",

The present article's empirical data set principally consists of formal and informal interviews with about 30 financial and business controllers in seven Nordic multinational companies. The interviews have been complemented with a large number of company presentations and internal documents around digital transformation within the finance function of these companies. Questions about the design and use of digital tools have been supplemented with questions about strategic and organizational issues in order to understand the context and what fundamental problems the digitalization efforts in the companies we researched addressed. Our research approach was abductive to its nature as our reading of theories (mainly theories about management control and internationalization strategies and control in multinational corporations) informed our understanding and steered our data collection.",

With the introduction of information systems and later of ERP systems, this changed profoundly. Companies like SAP and Oracle became more prominent in defining and deciding what types of skills were needed in order to succeed as a business or financial controller in a large multinational company. We believe that digital transformation will further reinforce this trend. For instance, companies will require skills in dealing with business intelligence or machine learning from their controllers. Being able to conduct high level analyses based on large amounts of data is frequently mentioned in this context. It indicates that statistics is a skill which many business controllers will likely be expected to master or least to be able to understand in order to assess and value the information that comes out from these types of analyses.",

What we find interesting is that these new \"colleagues\" will belong to the companies' human resources systems, and will also be given employee numbers, and even be part of certain organizational units. Companies will do so not to make the robots more human, but to make sure that there is someone accountable for the algorithms that run the show.",
