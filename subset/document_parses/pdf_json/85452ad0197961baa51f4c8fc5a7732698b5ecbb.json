LncRNAs (long non-coding RNAs) play an important role in the regulation of cancer cell malignant behavior and tumor development. In this work, we found that a newly discovered lncRNA, lncRNA PGM5P4-AS1, was lower expressed in lung cancer tissues than adjacent tissues. Then, the lncRNA PGM5P4-AS1 was overexpressed or knocked-down in different lung cancer cells, and its effects on the malignant phenotypes were measured by 3-(4, 5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay, cell cycle assay, wound healing assay, and transwell assay. The results showed that the overexpression of PGM5P4-AS1 inhibited lung cancer cell proliferation, migration, and invasion activities, while these abilities were prominently promoted by the interference of PGM5P4-AS1. Further, the growth of lung cancer tumors in nude mice was also inhibited by PGM5P4-AS1 overexpression. In mechanism, PGM5P4-AS1 has the binding site of miR-1275 and could positively regulate the expression of LZTS3 via sponging miR-1275. In conclusion, PGM5P4-AS1 could be a potential precise diagnosis and therapeutic target biomarker of lung cancer.",

Lung cancer can be divided into small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), which is further divided into adenocarcinoma (38.5% of all lung carcinoma), large cell carcinoma (2.9% of all lung cancer cases), and squamous cell carcinoma (20% of all lung cancer cases) [2] . Surgery, chemotherapy, and medication are the major therapeutic strategies to treat lung cancer. Many patients relapse and succumb within a short time because of poor treatments and advanced stages of diagnosis [3] . Molecular heterogeneity in lung cancer is one of the reasons for these situations [4, 5] . The dysregulated expression of cancer markers has been strongly linked to oncogenes or anti-tumor genes, that participate in carcinogenesis [6, 7] . Therefore, it is necessary to extend the potential cancerassociated molecule library to improve the precise diagnosis and antitumor therapies in lung cancer.",

However, most of these studies on PGM5P4-AS1 in various cancers are performed by bioinformatics analysis and are rarely verified by experiments. In particular, the effects of PGM5P4-AS1 in lung cancer has not been reported.

Most studies on PGM5P4-AS1 are performed by bioinformatics analysis and are rarely verified by experiments [17] [18] [19] . Herein, we found that PGM5P4-AS1 expression was lower in lung cancer tissues than adjacent tissues and we firstly identified its anti-tumor activity in vivo and in vitro. Accumulated evidence show that lncRNAs can interact with miRNA and further regulate its target genes at the post transcription level, which are known as ceRNAs [25, 26] . Yang et al. [27] reported that lncRNA LINC01133 inhibited gastric cancer progression via sponging miR-106a-3p to regulate the adenomatous polyposis coli gene expression. Zhao et al. [28] displayed that the knockdown of lncRNA HOTAIR suppressed cell proliferation, metastasis, and apoptosis by affecting the miR-20a-5p/HMGA2 axis. These lncRNArelated ceRNAs are associated with the anti-cancer progression. Thus, we speculated that PGM5P4-AS1 might also affect the malignant phenotypes of lung cancer by the regulation of miRNA and its targets.",

[29] reported that miR-1275 facilitated the tumorigenesis and metastasis in nasopharyngeal carcinoma by up-regulating integrin \u03b23. Xie et al. [30] found that miR-1275 was associated with radiosensitization in esophageal mediating by Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway. Ma et al. [31] reported that miRNA-1275 promoted lung cancer cell proliferation and migration via the regulation of FOXK1. Moreover, miR-1275 was proved to be highly expressed in NSCLC and promoted the cellular processes including cell proliferation, migration, and invasion by targeting LZTS3 [20] . In the current study, the results of luciferase reporter assay showed that PGM5P4-AS1 sponged miR-1275. We found that PGM5P4-AS1 overexpression induced blocking of proliferation, migration, and invasion abilities of lung cancer cells were all reversed by miR-1275 mimic. Subsequently, scholars revealed that LZTS3 regulated the process of cell growth and was thought to be a potential tumor suppressor [32] . Liu et al. [33] demonstrated that LZTS3 was predicted to be a potential prognostic biomarker in colorectal cancer by bioinformatics analysis. In the current study, LZTS3 acted as a target of miR-1275 in lung cancer cells. LTZS3 inhibited cell proliferation by down-regulating the cell cycle pathway protein cyclin D1 and suppressed cell migration by down-regulating metastasisrelated protein MMP2.",
