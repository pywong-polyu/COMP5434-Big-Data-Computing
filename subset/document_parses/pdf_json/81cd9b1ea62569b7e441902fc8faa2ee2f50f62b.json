However, people do not habitually consume their meals in sensory booths, individually partitioned in a room full of strangers, focused on a ballot to assess their food. Rather, they eat at home, in a restaurant or caf\u00e9; sometimes alone, but frequently with family, friends and colleagues [1] . Koster (2003) [2] has shown that testing in a sensory lab regular setup removes the natural consumption setting in which a food is consumed, and thus makes it difficult to elicit accurate data from consumers. Ecological validity is the degree to which a test there is also a need to develop more nutritious, safe, autochthonous, and quality-enhanced RTE meals.",

            "text": "Within this context, microwave pasteurization offers opportunities for the food industry to produce high quality, safe, frozen and chilled RTE meals [19] . The main advantage of a microwave-assisted pasteurization system (MAPS) over traditional thermal processing systems is reduced processing time; the generation of volumetric heat in this system makes it possible to increase the heat transfer rate and reduce the total heating time by three to five times [20, 21] . Thus, MAPS is particularly suitable for pasteurization of pre-packaged, heat-sensitive, multi-component meals that are highly viscous, semisolid, or solid [19] . Montero, Sablani, Tang and Ross (2020) [22] investigated the potential of MAPS to extend the shelf life of RTE fried rice. The authors found that MAPS processing was able to extend the shelf life of a chilled fried rice meal up to 6 weeks when stored at 7 \u2022 C, demonstrating the potential of this technology for the RTE industry. Barnett, Sablani, Tang and Ross (2019) [23] evaluated the shelf life of sterilized microwave-processed chicken meals and consumer liking of the meals and found that the overall liking did not vary due to the effect of storage time.",

Jambalaya, a regional dish of the American South, is a type of RTE meal that is increasingly available nationwide to consumers who are interested in exploring regional and global cuisines [24, 25] . Paralleling the HUT, an online auction determined consumers' willingness to pay.

In total, 180 were frozen as controls and 180 trays were pasteurized in a pilot-scale MAPS in the Food Processing Pilot Plant at Washington State University (WSU), Pullman, WA. A detailed description of MAPS can be found in Tang et al. (2018) [19] . The specific processing conditions used to produce jambalaya in the MAPS are described in the methods section of Montero et al., (2020) [22] . At the time the study was conducted, the MAPS could process 16 trays in one run; thus, there were 12 total runs. After being MAPSprocessed, the 180 trays were stored at 2.0 \u00b1 0.5 \u2022 C. A Temperature Data Logger RC-5+ (Elitech, CA, USA) was used to track the storage temperature during the whole study.",

Next, each jambalaya tray (250 g) was warmed at 45-50 \u00b0C for 30 min (15 min on each side, top and bottom) with a food warmer (Glo-Ray HATCO Corporation, Milwaukee, WI, USA). Then the trays were opened, and the jambalaya was carefully mixed. A total of 17-20 g of warmed jambalaya was then portioned into plastic cups; each sample was checked to ensure it contained all of the proportionally identical components of the jambalaya (sausage, shrimp, chicken). All samples were evaluated at 40 \u00b1 1 \u00b0C. A 30 s break was given after the evaluation of each sample.

This result could indicate that it was possible to identify potential difference due to the storage time effect as the number of responses increased. Two main effects were evaluated with the 71 collected responses. To test Hypothesis 1, the effect of the processing method (MAPS-processed and in chilled storage vs. control, cooked and frozen storage), the effect of the storage time, and their respective interaction on the consumer liking scores for the different sensory modalities were evaluated.

A similar HUT study by Olsen et al., (2012) [13] determined that overall liking of the meal drives consumers' likelihood of buying healthy convenience meals. As in the present study, complex foods were evaluated. Two ready-to-heat meals with multiple components or different ingredients were assessed: (1) salmon fillets with raw vegetables (cauliflower, carrots, and green beans), precooked pasta and pasteurized cream and mushroom sauce; and (2) chicken breast fillets, with raw vegetables (cauliflower, carrots, and green beans), precooked white rice and pasteurized red bell pepper sauce. However, Olsen's results focused on drivers of overall liking including appearance, odor, amount of ingredients, and flavor. While these attributes were also considerations in our study, our study also focused on the effects of the processing method, storage time and the enhanced social environment in which the food was consumed along with the willingness to purchase of the product.",

The auction protocol established that participants received money for placing the bids at each evaluation time point, and because the economic resources were limited, only the 50 participants joined the online auction. The bidding was performed based on the sensory evaluation of each of the jambalaya meals. Information of the processing system was not included at the time of placing the bid at the first time point; this type of information was given at the second and third time points. However, during these two points, the information was provided after the participants conducted the sensory evaluation and prior to submitting their bids [24] . As previously mentioned, the effect of the processing method, storage time and their interaction on the bid values were also analyzed. The interaction was not significant and for this reason the main effects were interpreted. The bid values did not significantly differ (p = 0.48) between the MAPS-processed jambalaya and the control, and they were not influenced by the storage time ( Table 4) .",

            "text": "To test Hypothesis 2, the effect of eating with a partner in the liking scores of the sensory characteristics of the meals were also evaluated ( Table 6 ). It was determined that those participants having a partner gave a significantly higher score (p = 0.04) to the appearance of the jambalaya meals. The value was 5.88 vs. 5.54 for those participants without a partner. This liking value is associated with a rating between like slightly and like moderately on a seven-point hedonic scale. Overall, there was a trend in the liking scores of the evaluated sensory attributes; those participants with a partner gave higher scores to the liking of all the evaluated sensory attributes of the meals. Laureati and Pagliarini (2019) [5] defined three main contextual factors that influence eating behavior when conducting consumer testing, the meal (i.e., sensory characteristics); the physical environment (i.e., appropriate location and setting); and the social environment or social interaction (i.e., people present at the experiment). In this study, each of those factors was explored and the social environment seemed to be positively impacted by the partners addition. Piliner, Bell, Kinchla and Hirsch (2003) [33] stated that social interaction has a positive effect on food consumption of naturally created groups but not artificially created. In our study, the partners (spouse, friend, roommate) could be categorized as members of a naturally created group for the participants or that will evoke a more realistic consumption situation [34, 35] . Petit and Siefferman (2007) [36] maintain that conducting food testing in naturalistic conditions is more advantageous than in-lab tests due to the realism of the evaluation, but situational tests such as HUTs can be more expensive and time-consuming than in-lab ones. As shown in our study, the addition of a partner could mitigate some of these downsides, mainly the one related to costs. Currently, with COVID-19 restrictions, including responses from partners could represent a simple option for sensory scientists and food companies to increase the number of respondents and enhance ecological validity of the study.",

Barnett et al. (2019) [23] reported increases in the intensities of some aroma and flavor attributes of microwave-processed Cajun chicken pasta meals as the storage time increased. The concentration of aroma and flavor may have resulted from potential water migration from the package [23, 37] .",

Using a HUT to evaluate consumer acceptance of jambalaya and including partner participation, is a promising way of testing acceptance in a more realistic context. An on-line auction with a HUT sensory testing of jambalaya meals showed that consumers are willing to pay a price that is comparable to commercially available jambalaya meals.
