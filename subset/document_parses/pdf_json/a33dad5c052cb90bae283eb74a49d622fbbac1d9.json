There is therefore an urgent necessity to reach net-zero carbon emissions. Only 4.5% of countries have achieved carbon neutrality, and most countries are still planning to do so by 2050-2070. Moreover, synergies between different countries have hampered synergies between adaptation and mitigation policies, as well as their co-benefits. Here, we present a strategy to reach a carbon neutral economy by examining the outcome goals of the 26th summit of the United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP 26). Methods have been designed for mapping carbon emissions, such as input-output models, spatial systems, geographic information system maps, light detection and ranging techniques, and logarithmic mean divisia. We present decarbonization technologies and initiatives, and negative emissions technologies, and we discuss carbon trading and carbon tax. We propose plans for carbon neutrality such as shifting away from fossil fuels toward renewable energy, and the development of low-carbon technologies, low-carbon agriculture, changing dietary habits and increasing the value of food and agricultural waste. Developing resilient buildings and cities, introducing decentralized energy systems, and the electrification of the transportation sector is also necessary. We also review the life cycle analysis of carbon neutral systems.",

            "text": "With the increasing global industrialization and overexploitation of non-renewable energy sources, a large number of greenhouse gases have been released, leading to an increase in global temperature and causing a series of environmental degradation issues . From pre-industrialization, around 1850, until 2022, the global average atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentration increased substantially from 285 to 419 ppm (Chen 2021 ; CO 2 Daily 2022). As a result, the United Kingdom meteorological office estimates a global average surface temperature increase of about 0.97 to 1.21 \u00b0C throughout 1850-2022, with a central estimate of 1.09 \u00b0C; they also predict that 2022 will continue the trend of the warmest years in the world (Sangomla 2022) . Furthermore, global greenhouse gas emissions are expected to rise by 50% by 2050, owing primarily to CO 2 emissions from non-renewable energy use (Rabaey and Ragauskas 2014) . Without effective measures or technologies to reduce or control CO 2 emissions, the global average atmospheric CO 2 concentration, as well as the global surface and ocean temperatures, will continue to rise. The rising global temperature caused by these greenhouse gases has already caused significant damage to the human living environment, including the extinction of some species, loss of biodiversity, droughts, floods, forest fires, ocean acidification, melting of north and south pole glaciers (NSPG), and sea-level rise (Maximillian et al. 2019; Mora et al. 2018; Yang et al. 2022) .",

Furthermore, to achieve carbon neutrality, the intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC), in its special report on global warming of 1.5 \u00b0C, also emphasized the need to reduce and phase out fossil fuels, use more renewable energy, improve energy efficiency, and highlighted the importance of implementing these measures in cities to achieve carbon neutrality (Masson-Delmotte et al. 2018) . Moreover, to achieve net-zero carbon emissions and sustainable development, carbon removal or sequestration in terrestrial and marine ecosystems must be promoted (Cheng 2020) . Different regions, countries, and cities have developed strategies to improve carbon removal or sequestration and achieve carbon neutrality (Hepburn et al. 2021; Pedersen et al. 2020; Huang and Zhai 2021 ), yet achieving net-zero carbon emissions is challenging .",

Furthermore, the review explores global initiatives, primarily referring to the policies or measures put in place by individual countries to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. The review also investigates in detail the interrelationships and synergies between adaptation and mitigation strategies, maps direct and indirect carbon emissions and proposes two main approaches to achieving carbon neutrality: emissions reduction and atmospheric carbon removal. Moreover, the review presents carbon-free plans for the future in transportation, agriculture, food waste, industry, and other areas and examines the life cycle analysis of various carbon neutral systems for the technologies or measures to achieve these plans. Finally, the review provides relevant and up-todate information, policies, and technologies for achieving carbon neutrality and assists governments and people in different regions and countries in understanding the positive environmental, social, and economic consequences of carbon neutrality.",

It is well known that greenhouse gas emission reductions are a key factor in human health. The 2030 enhanced emission reduction targets (in the form of nationally determined contributions) and the mid-century long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies that the worldwide governments are supposed to submit to the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties have only been submitted by countries accounting for 55% and 32% of global greenhouse gas emissions, respectively (Wyns and Beagley 2021) . At the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, climate change moved from a marginal issue to a worldwide priority. With the attention of world leaders, government representatives, businesses and citizens focused on the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties in Glasgow, expectations are high for countries to make new commitments on reducing carbon emissions. In the meantime, it is essential to look back at another United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties. For the first time ever, a major event occurred in 2015. At the 21st United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties, every country agreed to combat the negative impacts of climate change by working together to keep global warming in a range well below 2 \u00b0C, with a target value of 1.5 \u00b0C (Vogler 2020) . At the same time, each nation party agreed to provide funding to achieve these goals (van den Berg et al. 2022) . This marked the birth of the Paris agreement.",

The second is to replace fuel-based transport with electric transport as soon as possible and to develop electric vehicles. Regarding the latter two goals, the $100 billion in annual financial support pledged by developed countries to developing countries in 2010 will have to be delivered. At the same time, climate change solutions, which are part of the biology of global change, should be implemented and delivered . Figure 1 presents the four main outcomes of the 26th United Nations Climate Change Conference of the Parties.

Compact urban development reduces per capita travel demand, energy demand for heating and cooling, and provides energy systems that are more efficient, so lowering carbon emissions and mitigating climate change. Additionally, compact urban development decreases land demand, avoids risky locations, and is less susceptible to intense heat events than urban sprawl, allowing for climate change adaptation. Congestion pricing and water-sensitive urban designs are two other examples of transportation and urban design sector strategies in synergy and enhance both mitigation and adaptation.",

Positive synergies are mitigation measures that do not increase vulnerability and adaptation measures that do not increase greenhouse gas emissions (Zhao et al. 2018) . For example, afforestation creates a beneficial synergy since afforestation works as a carbon sink and protects from calamities. Certain mitigation and adaptation techniques include trade-offs with unfavourable consequences. For instance, constructing a hydroelectric power plant will reduce greenhouse gas emissions due to its renewable energy source. However, a hydroelectric power plant will increase competition for water with local communities, compromising adaptation. On the other hand, while constructing a dam to prevent seawater intrusion will secure water supply and so reduce vulnerability, dam construction will generate greenhouse gases as a result of the cement and steel needed in construction, thereby impairing mitigation. Prior to implementing mitigation and adaptation techniques, policymakers should conduct an in-depth analysis to ensure that co-benefits are realized rather than negative impacts.",

Synergies have been discovered in Copenhagen between energy efficiency and flood protection criteria for building design. Furthermore, the study discovered a contradiction in which a higher capacity of groundwater pumps was necessary to regulate floodwater, resulting in increased energy consumption. In Helsinki, strong national policies on energyefficient building design compelled municipal governments to prioritize mitigation measures such as building insulation over adaptation measures such as using durable materials to safeguard buildings from flooding.

Additionally, demand-side emission reduction efforts include efficiency gains realized through the implementation of energy-efficient processes and sector-specific technologies that reduce energy consumption, as well as end-use fuel switching from fossil-based to renewable fuels and the deployment of renewable energy technologies (Fawzy et al. 2020) . Another important sector contributing to carbon emissions is agriculture and animal farming.",

The results of the four targets have far-reaching positive implications for achieving carbon neutrality globally. Meanwhile, this study gave a full and exhaustive overview of worldwide initiatives to attain carbon neutrality, the majority of which are policies or measures implemented by specific countries.

Simultaneously, modifying dietary habits (more vegetarian, less meat, less food waste) can help minimize the negative effects of climate change in terms of agricultural land use, food consumption patterns, and waste disposal. Pasture restoration, integrated crop-livestock-forestry systems, no-till agriculture, afforestation, biological nitrogen fixation, and organic waste recycling are all examples of climate change mitigation techniques.

On the industrial front, encouraging enterprises to switch to biofuels as an energy source via proper legislation and incentives is a sound strategy. Carbon neutrality for the industry in the future can be reached by climate and energy legislation, non-hydro, non-biofuel renewable energy expansion, and the circular economy, as well as the deployment of new technologies such as carbon capture, utilization and storage. Transitioning the transportation sector to clean energy is a challenging task, and establishing a hydrogen supply chain for new vehicles, ensuring secure hydrogen supply management, and increasing financial support is definite approaches to promote environmental change.
