Despite its high incidence, long-COVID is still an unknown condition. While there are studies showing an increased risk of persistent symptoms in more severe patients [1] , other studies report that the development and severity of persistent symptoms do not seem to be associated with the severity of the acute infection [4, 13] . So far, there are no clear laboratory or radiological features to diagnose long-COVID, and the condition is thought to be heterogeneous, with potentially several phenotypes with different presentations and prognosis [14, 15] . Virus-induced changes, endothelial dysfunction, immunological alterations, and/or expected sequelae have been proposed as responsible for long-COVID [16] ; however, the underlying pathophysiology of these long-term effects has not yet been well-characterized. In addition, there are no established protocols for the management of these patients. In this study, we set out to broaden the understanding of the pathophysiology underlying long-COVID and to test the effectiveness of corticosteroids in this condition, with the aim of helping define diagnostic and treatment guidelines to manage these patients with COVID-19 sequelae.",

Nine out 14 described persistent symptoms (PSP), while five described a completely healthy status (NSP) (see Table S1 ). Eight PSP patients received a 4-day course of corticosteroids (prednisone, 30 mg/day), after which another sample was collected (TTP). A total of 16 mL of blood was collected in K2EDTA tubes for immune phenotyping. Clinical symptoms were evaluated before and after treatment. A second post-treatment sample was obtained in six patients with persistent symptoms (TTP+4M) 4 months after the course of corticosteroids. The institutional Clinical Research Ethics Committee approved the study protocol (reference no. 20/167), and all patients signed an informed consent. [16] . A total of 34 different immune populations were identified as shown in Figure S6 . Cells were acquired using a Cytek \u00ae Aurora flow cytometer (Cytek Biosciences, Fremont, CA, USA) and analyzed by FlowJo V10 (Tree Star, Ashland, OR, USA). T-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) graphs were performed by using dowsample and tSNE FlowJo V10 plugins. Markers used for each tSNE are specified in the figure legends.",

PSP had significantly increased conventional CD11c+ dendritic cells (cDC; p < 0.01) and natural killer T (NKT)-like cells (p < 0.05), and significantly decreased CD123+ plasmacytoid DC (pDC; p < 0.05) and total circulating innate lymphoid cells (ILC; p < 0.001), when compared to NSP (Figure 2a) . After corticosteroid treatment, NKT lymphocytes and, more markedly, cDC dropped, and ILC frequency increased, to levels similar to those of NSP. We did not find any differences in natural killer (NK) cell subpopulations, except for decreased terminal NK cells in PSP compared with NSP (p < 0.05) that recovered after treatment (p < 0.01, Figure S1 ). Within the monocyte compartment, there was a trend towards overrepresentation of intermediate monocytes (CD14+CD16+) in PSP, as observed during acute COVID-19 [18] [19] [20] , while classical (CD14+CD16\u2212) and non-classical (CD14\u2212CD16+) monocytes showed similar levels to NSP ( Figure S2a ). The surface expression of CCR2, CCR5, HLA-DR, and CD86 in the non-inflammatory, classical monocytes was similar between NSP and PSP ( Figure S2b ). However, intermediate and, in particular, inflammatory, non-classical monocytes in PSP showed a significantly higher expression of these chemotactic and co-stimulatory markers than in NSP ( Figure S2b ). After corticosteroid treatment, a decreased expression of all these markers on the surface of non-classical monocyte was observed ( Figure S2b ). Upon in vitro stimulation with LPS, isolated CD14+ monocytes from PSP showed a trend towards a higher capacity to secrete the pro-inflammatory cytokines GM-CSF, IL-18, IL-1b, IL-6, MIP-1a, and TNFa than NSP monocytes, which reached significance in the case of IL-8 ( Figure S2c ). The production of cytokines significantly dropped after the corticosteroid treatment. Overall, we observed a pro-inflammatory phenotype in PSP, even over a year after the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, characterized by an increase in antigenic presentation capacity and augmented expression of markers of migration and activation in pro-inflammatory monocytes. In vitro stimulated monocytes from PSP showed increased potential to secrete cytokines. This inflammatory profile was reverted by the short course of corticosteroids. ",

Circulatory follicular helper T cells (cTfh) were also reduced in PSP (p < 0.05). The CD4+ T cell compartment in PSP was not only skewed towards memory but it was also significantly enriched in activated (HLA-DR+CD38+) (p < 0.001) and pro-apoptotic, exhausted (CD95+PD1+) cells (p < 0.001, Figure 2c ). Subpopulations of memory CD4+ T cells and cTfh were also identified according to previous reports [21] [22] [23] . In both, a decrease of Th2 and Th17 cells towards a substantial increase of Th1 cells (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively) marked a dysregulated compartment in PSP in comparison to NSP (Figure 2d,e) . Finally, in agreement with the inflammatory environment in PSP, regulatory T cells (Treg) were decreased in these patients (p < 0.001, Figure 2f ). Similar alterations were found in the CD8+ T cell compartment of PSP. There was a decrease in na\u00efve CD8+ T cells in PSP compared with NSP (p < 0.05), together with a nonsignificant increase of TEMRA CD8+ T cells (Figure 2g ). Activated and senescent cells were also significantly enriched within CD8+ T cells (p < 0.01 and p < 0.001, respectively) ( Figure S3 ). All of these imbalances in the CD4+ and CD8+ T cell compartment normalized after corticosteroid treatment (Figure 2b-g) and were not related to persistent alterations from acute infection in the complete blood count (e.g., lymphopenia or neutrophilia) as both NSP and PSP had normal hemogram values (Table S2 ). The scarcity of na\u00efve and overrepresentation of memory T cells, together with the high expression of activation markers in PSP, could suggest a continuous antigenic stimulation. All NSP and PSP included in the study had a current negative antigen test and RT-PCR for SARS-CoV-2 from nasopharyngeal samples; however, this does not exclude the possibility of viral persistence in other locations such as central nervous or digestive systems [24] [25] [26] . Alterations in the T cell compartment have been described in convalescent COVID-19 patients, particularly the persistence of activated CD8+ T cells for up to 6 months post-infection [19, 27] . Despite the aforementioned disturbances in the distribution of T cell populations, the secretion of interleukin (IL)-2, interferon gamma (IFNg), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) by CD4+ or CD8+ T cells after polyclonal in vitro stimulation was similar between PSP and NSP, and corticosteroid treatment did not have a clear effect on cytokine synthesis ( Figure S4 ). The lack of increased cytokine production by activated T cells in PSP, together with their elevated expression of PD-1, raises the possibility of these memory CD4+ and CD8+ T cells being exhausted. The use of PMA and ionomycin instead of more physiological stimuli such as CD3, CD28 antibodies, or viral peptide pools may be considered a limitation in the assessment of cytokine production. Of note, there was an imbalance towards Th1 cells in PSP, which coincides with the findings by Shuwa et al. [27] in convalescent patients at shorter time post-infection and indicates the existence of an inflammatory state in these patients, which improves upon corticosteroid treatment. Alterations in the na\u00efve and memory B cell balance were also observed in PSP. These patients with long-COVID had a lower level of na\u00efve B cells and a higher level of non-class-switched memory B cells, while class-switched memory B cell and plasmablast levels were similar to those in NSP (Figure 2h ). This phenotypic imbalance was reverted after the prednisone treatment. There were no differences in IgM, IgG, or IgA levels between NSP and PSP ( Figure S5 ). Long-COVID has been proposed to be associated with the presence of autoimmune antibodies [28, 29] . In order to elucidate if autoantibodies may associate with the persistence of symptoms in PSP, we analyzed a wide group of antibodies including antiphospholipid (aPL), antineutrophil cytoplasmic (ANCA), antinuclear (ANA), and myositis and neuronal-related autoantibodies. The great majority of autoantibodies were negative in all patients (Table S3 ), suggesting that autoimmunity did not play a role in the persistent symptoms in these patients. Despite the alterations found in T and B lymphocyte subpopulations, all PSP vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 developed anti-Spike specific cellular and humoral responses.",
