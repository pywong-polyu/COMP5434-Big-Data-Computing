OBJECTIVE: To follow TIME participant clinical outcomes for 24 months PARTICIPANTS: Low-income Latino(a)s with type 2 diabetes DESIGN AND INTERVENTION: We collected postintervention clinical data for five cohorts (n = 101, mean n = 20/cohort) who participated in TIME programs from 2018 to 2020 in Houston, Texas. MAIN MEASURES: We gathered HbA1c (primary outcome), weight, body mass index (BMI), and blood pressure data at baseline, 6 months (intervention end), and semiannually thereafter until 24 months after baseline to assess sustainability. We also evaluated participant loss to follow-up until 24 months. KEY RESULTS: Participants decreased HbA1c levels during the intervention (p < 0.0001) and maintained these improvements at each timepoint from baseline to 24 months (p range: < 0.0001 to 0.015). Participants reduced blood pressure levels during TIME and maintained these changes at each timepoint from baseline until 18 months (systolic p range < 0.0001 to 0.0005, diastolic p range: < 0.0001 to 0.008) but not at 24 months (systolic: p = 0.065; diastolic: p = 0.85). There were no significant weight changes during TIME or post-intervention: weight (p range = 0.07 to 0.77), BMI (p range = 0.11 to 0.71). Attrition rates (loss to follow-up during the post-intervention period) were 5.9% (6 months), 24.8% (12 months), 35.6% (18 months), and 41.8% (24 months). CONCLUSIONS: It is possible for vulnerable populations to maintain long-term glycemic and blood pressure improvements using a multiple dimensional intervention. Attrition rates rose over time but show promise given the majority of post-intervention timepoints occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic when low-income populations were most susceptible to suboptimal healthcare access. Future studies are needed to evaluate longitudinal outcomes of diabetes interventions conducted by local clinics rather than research teams.

Diabetes care costs $327 billion annually, consuming 25% of US healthcare dollars. 2 Individuals with diabetes from low socioeconomic status face numerous barriers to care. These include medication access, transportation, language, healthy food availability, health literacy, and insurance. 3, 4 Latino(a)s are twice as likely to develop diabetes than non-Hispanic whites and suffer from more complications, hyperglycemia, and poor quality of life. 1, 5 Numerous targeted diabetes intervention studies have demonstrated improved outcomes among low-income minorities.

It was the first study to our knowledge to integrate CHWs into group visit leadership teams as well as utilize telehealth to provide ongoing CHW support. During the intervention, participants significantly improved diabetes outcomes compared to the control arm including lower HbA1c (\u2212 1.43% vs. \u2212 0.45%, p = 0.002), improved blood pressure levels (systolic: \u2212 6.89 mmHg vs. 0.003 mmHg, p = 0.023; diastolic: \u2212 3.36 mmHg vs. 0.2 mmHg, p = 0.046), and greater American Diabetes Association guideline adherence (p < 0.001) from baseline to 6 months, respectively, but did not result in significant body mass index (BMI) or weight reductions. The program also showed the value of CHWs in identifying barriers to care that may have otherwise been unrecognized. [9] [10] [11] The clinical outcomes achieved during TIME are important, but it is not known if these clinical outcomes would be sustainable over time or worsen as would be expected without an intervention. [12] [13] [14] [15] In this study, we evaluated post-intervention data of TIME participants. Specifically, we recorded semiannual HbA1c (primary outcome), blood pressure, weight, and BMI data from baseline to 24 months to assess sustainability. We hypothesized that the significant clinical improvements achieved during the TIME programs, in particular HbA1c and blood pressure reduction, would be sustained during the postintervention period.",

Individuals who were insured or earned greater than the allotted income were not eligible for clinic services. Study inclusion criteria were adults \u2265 18 years, Latino(a)s, type 2 diabetes (HbA1c \u2265 6.5%), and Spanish-speaking. Individuals were excluded if they did not attend at least one group visit (n = 0); were pregnant (n = 1); had severe cognitive impairment (n = 0); required frequent provider encounters, e.g., for labile glucose levels (n = 1); or had a treatment or condition that could alter reliable HbA1c measurements (n = 2). 16 Recruitment processes included contacting potential participants identified by a clinic database or provider referrals, inviting interested individuals to an orientation for written consent, and baseline data collection, i.e., HbA1c.

Telehealth (video conferencing, mobile health (mHealth) phone/text) was utilized to enhance CHWparticipant and CHW-provider communication. 17, 18 Providers met with CHWs weekly via video conferencing for training and support; CHWs contacted participants via mHealth weekly to reiterate educational topics from group visits, obtain glucose values, ensure medication adherence, and answer questions.

Starting in month seven, participants returned to usual care in the clinic with their primary care providers in lieu of receiving care from the study physicians.

There are several possibilities for the clinical regression and increased attrition rates during months 7-12. The majority (78.5%) of data timepoints occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic. This affected clinic eligibility, medication availability, and other aspects of access to care including obtaining routine laboratory values, e.g., HbA1c. Additionally, the clinic ensured that all participants maintained their clinic eligibility in order to complete TIME during the active intervention period, including those who may have lost access otherwise, e.g., incomplete paperwork or obtaining insurance. This likely contributed to the initial increased attrition after the intervention. Further, some clinic providers changed participant medications to high-cost agents or insulin. Recent Medicaid expansions make it easier to obtain high-cost medications, but many in our population would not meet the requirements, e.g., inability to provide citizenship or residency status. 27 In addition, barriers to insulin in underserved populations including lower education attainment, food insecurity, and access to care significantly increase the likelihood of medication nonadherence, hypoglycemic episodes, and poorly controlled diabetes. [28] [29] [30] On the other hand, blood pressure medications are typically generic, reducing access barriers. This may provide rationale for more stable blood pressure levels postintervention.",

            "text": "Though not entirely clear, there are few possibilities why BMI and weight trends increased during the post-intervention period (months 7-12). The majority of study timepoints occurred during COVID-19, which negatively impacted weight. Investigators found that nearly half of individuals gained weight, reporting poor dietary habits and high stress levels; average BMI and weight levels increased 0.54 kg/m 2 and 0.62 kg, respectively, during the pandemic. 24, 31 In our population, most employments were active, e.g., manual labor, which decreased or was omitted during COVID-19, further risking inactivity. Additionally, TIME focuses on prescribing hypoglycemics that are available to low-income populations. Two of the three available (pioglitazone, sulfonylureas) are associated with weight gain. 20 It is likely that the effects of CHW involvement during the post-intervention period were likely not immediate. For example, the timeframe for participants to receive post-intervention appointments, and realize and communicate barriers to CHWs, and for CHWs to provide assistance often lasted several months. It is probable, however, that CHW involvement during months 7-12 enhanced the sustainability of clinical outcomes. Future studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy of longitudinal CHW-participant mHealth communication in improving engagement in healthcare systems.",

However, more than half of the participants remained active in the clinic for diabetes care at month 24 during the pandemic. Additionally, the data are retrospective and observational without a control arm. Future, prospective randomized studies managed by routine clinic personnel are warranted.",
