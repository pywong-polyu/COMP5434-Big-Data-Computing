            "text": "We study the impact on the epidemiological dynamics of a class of restrictive measures that are aimed at reducing the number of contacts of individuals who have a higher risk of being infected with a transmittable disease. Such measures are currently either implemented or at least discussed in numerous countries worldwide to ward off a potential new wave of COVID-19. They come in the form of Health Passes (HP), which grant full access to public life only to individuals with a certificate that proves that they have either been fully vaccinated, have recovered from a previous infection or have recently tested negative to SARS-Cov-2. We develop both a compartmental model as well as an epidemic Renormalisation Group approach, which is capable of describing the dynamics over a longer period of time, notably an entire epidemiological wave. Introducing different versions of HPs in this model, we are capable of providing quantitative estimates on the effectiveness of the underlying measures as a function of the fraction of the population that is vaccinated and the vaccination rate. We apply our models to the latest COVID-19 wave in several European countries, notably Germany and Austria, which validate our theoretical findings.",

These are periods of exponential growth in the number of infected individuals, followed by (quasi-)linear growth phases. Modelling this dynamics in 2021 is involved due to a number of different factors: (1) the availability of several different vaccines, which started being deployed at the end of 2020, and national vaccination campaigns around the globe; (2) the appearance of several variants of SARS-Cov-2 , which differ in their infection rate [1] [2] [3] [4] and their ability to avoid antibody responses (recent theoretical 5 and numerical 6 studies explore the impact of variants on the pandemic diffusion); (3) non-pharmaceutical interventions (ranging from lockdowns to various degrees of social distancing measures) taking into account economical, social and political factors. In particular regarding i), roughly 37% of the global population is fully vaccinated as of the end of October 2021, see Ourwo rldin data. org, however with only very few countries having reached a rate of > 50% , which is still largely below the projected herd-immunity threshold.",

Such measures require individuals to present certificates, which prove that they present a low risk of being infectious, in order to participate in the public life. The certificates attest that the person is fully vaccinated against COVID-19 (after having received the required number of doses of an approved vaccine and a certain waiting time), or that they have recovered from a not too distant infection or that they have recently tested negative for SARS-Cov-2. In fact, different combinations of the above are present at national level. The social measure requires to present the certificate before entering locations or events where the risk of contagion is high 7 , such as public places (restaurants, bars, museums, shopping malls etc.), social events (concerts, theatres, cinemas etc.), public means of transportation (trains, airplanes,etc.) or universities and schools. Since the specifics and the names differ from country to country, in the following we shall collectively refer to these certificates as Health Passes (HPs). Examples for concrete implementations in different European countries can be found in Section S6.1 of the Supplementary Material.",

            "text": "mathematical modelling of infectious diseases has a long standing history, and several different approaches exist in the literature: these range from stochastic methods [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] to deterministic compartmental models [14] [15] [16] (including the effect of vaccines [17] [18] [19] [20] to computer-and data driven approaches [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] and network models [26] [27] [28] . The advent of SARS-Cov-2 has caused a spike of research activity, with new models exploring key aspects of the pandemic, for example its multi-wave structure 29, 30 and the evaluation of its impact on society and economy [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . Models that quantify the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions have also been proposed [37] [38] [39] [40] and validated on the COVID-19 available data. Nevertheless, the specific impact of HPs has not been studied in the literature yet, and our work aims at covering this gap. In the current work we shall exploit the interplay between two types of models, namely a compartmental model and the epidemiological Renormalisation Group (eRG) approach. The former is among the oldest approaches 14 (see 16, 41 for further references) and it treats the spread of an infectious disease by dividing the population into several compartments containing individuals in different states with respect to the disease (e.g. susceptible, exposed, infectious, recovered etc.). The passage of individuals from one compartment to another is described through a set of coupled first order differential equations in time, which can be seen as a continuous mean-field approximations of a more microscopic description of the infections 12, 13, 41 . Models of this type can be easily adapted and extended 31 by adding compartments 42, 43 , stratifying them in terms of age groups or geographical location 44 and upgrading the parameter to functions of time for a better fit to the data. Compartmental models are particularly useful in establishing qualitative relations between microscopic aspects of the spread of the disease among individuals and more macroscopic observables, such as the total number of individuals who have become infected at the end of an epidemic wave. However, in their simplest incarnation with constant transition rates, these models are capable of describing the time evolution accurately only over a relatively short period of time. Due to the fact that the epidemiological situation constantly changes (as we explained above), the rates need to be adapted as functions of time. The eRG framework has been introduced 29, 30 to capture, more efficiently, the time evolution of the disease diffusion by explicitly taking into account symmetry, being inspired by the physical concepts of time-invariance symmetry and fixed points (the concept of Renormalisation Group Equations (RGE) has been originally developed in the context of statistical and particle physics [45] [46] [47] . Concretely, the eRG framework takes the form of a set of flow equations (called the \u03b2-functions) that describe the evolution of a quantity of epidemiological interest (e.g. a smooth monotonic function of the cumulative number of infected individuals I c ) as the flow between different fixed points. It has been demonstrated 48, 49 that the eRG approach is indeed capable of describing accurately not only a full wave of COVID-19, but is also capable of modelling more complex multi-wave structures 50,51 even under changing conditions, like the appearance of new variants 5 , vaccination dynamics 52 , change in the social dynamics 53 , among the ones mentioned above.",

The latter efficiently encapsulates the symmetries and long-term aspects of epidemics. The methodology we followed is schematically illustrated in Fig. 1 : we first introduce a compartmental model (called SIIRV) which contains 5 compartments, namely S (unvaccinated susceptible), I 1 (unvaccinated infectious), I 2 (previously vaccinated infectious), R (removed) and V (vaccinated susceptible). Although vaccines have fairly high efficacies in preventing infections in the vaccinated population (around 80-90% for the best cases), here we take into account the fact that vaccines neither grant complete immunity against an infection from SARS-Cov-2 nor prevent the transmission of the virus from an infected vaccinated individuals to others. Assuming constant rates at which individuals pass between these compartments, this model is capable of fitting epidemiological data only over a short period of time \u2460. Alas, this class of models is not capable of describing correctly the dynamics of an entire wave of COVID-19. Hence, we ensure a correct description of the epidemiological data via the eRG framework \u2461. Matching the solutions of the SIIRV model with the eRG provides time-dependent infection and removal rates \u2462, which allow to extend the range of validity of the compartmental model to accurately reproduce the data. We then implement two different types of HP-models at the level of the SIIRV model (with www.nature.com/scientificreports/ time-dependent rates): the net effect is a reduction in the contact rates between certain classes of individuals, thus corresponding to a systematic re-scaling of certain terms in the differential equations controlled by an efficacy parameter p. Studying the dynamics of the resulting system allows us to implement the HP-models in the eRG \u2463 by introducing a p-dependence in its parameters. This provides us with a model that not only allows to make long-term predictions \u2464 for HP-models but also to compare \u2465 different types of HP among each other and the current situation in different countries. We consider two different types of HP-measures putting different emphasis on vaccinated versus unvaccinated individuals:",

To this end we assume that represents the total number of infectious individuals (either vaccinated or unvaccinated) at time t, where \u03c4 is the average amount of time an infectious individual remains infectious. We have verified that this assumption does not play any crucial role in the following analysis, and that it is compatible with the epidemiological data in Germany and Austria (see Supplementary Material for more details). Furthermore, in order to reproduce the cumulative number of infected (9) along with I(t) = N(I 1 + I 2 )(t) in (10) with the SIIRV model (1) and (2), it is generally required that the infection and recovery rates of the compartmental model are functions of time 30 . We first validated the matching in a simple scenario, with fixed ratio \u03c3 2 /\u03c3 1 and in absence of vaccinations (i.e. \u03c1 = 0 and V 0 = 0) . An typical example of time-dependent (\u03c3 1 , \u03b5) matching to the eRG solution is shown in Fig. 2 . Functions of this form were previously found 30 when matching the eRG approach to a time-dependent SIR model. More precisely, as is showcased by the black interpolating lines in Fig. 2 , the time dependence of (\u03c3 1 (t), \u03b5(t)) can be approximated by logistic functions of the form where \u03c3 \u223c \u03b5 \u223c 0 and t \u03c3 \u223c t \u03b5 \u223c t 0 while (A \u03c3 , \u03b4 \u03c3 , A \u03b5 , \u03b5 ) show a more complicated dependence on (A 0 , 0 , t 0 ).",

As explained in the Supplementary material, this is still accomplished by a functional dependence of the form (11) for (\u03c3 1 (t), \u03b5(t)) with a roughly linear dependence of A \u03c3 on V 0 . www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Finally we turn on the vaccination rate \u03c1 . For the eRG framework, the dependence of I c on the vaccination rate has been discussed 52 , and it has been proposed to promote 0 and A 0 to dynamical functions of time that follow the additional first-order differential equations in supplement to the \u03b2-function (8). This implies 0 (t) = 0 (t = 0)[1 \u2212 t \u03c1] , while the second equation in (13) for w = 1 derives from the fact that, at any given time t, the reduction of the asymptotic cumulative number of infected individuals can only depend on remaining number of susceptible A 0 (t) \u2212 I c (t) 52 . As further explained in Section S4 of the Supplementary Material, here we find that a better match with the solutions of the SIIRV model can be obtained with w \u2208 [0, 1).",

The right panel of this figure shows a comparison of their asymptotics (i.e. at the end of the wave) as a function of p (and normalised to p = 1 ). For a certain range of p < 1 , the numerical solutions can be interpolated by exponential functions of the form with the two models mainly differing by the constant fitting parameters \u03b8 (VT) and \u03b8 (V ) . In fact, approximations of this type are already viable within the framework of a SIR model 14 without any vaccination dynamics. More details, including a comparison of (14) with the first and second order of a Taylor series expansion around p = 1 can be found in the Supplementary Material. Assuming all remaining parameters to be the same (notably the recovery rate \u03b5 ), the same efficacy of the HP-models (4) and (6), p VT and p V respectively, lead to different asymptotic cumulative numbers of infected individuals. We can turn this relation around by determining which values of p VT and p V (for all other parameters being held fixed), lead to the same number of infected individuals at the end of the epidemic wave. The red line in the left panel of Fig. 5 shows the relation between p V and p VT that needs to be satisfied in order to obtain the same asymptotic behaviour: for the parameters chosen, 1 \u2212 p VT in a HP that accepts both test and vaccination certificates needs to be roughly a factor 2 larger than 1 \u2212 p V in a HP , Fig. 5 can be studied using the approximation (14) , which implies equivalent asymptotic numbers of infected individuals for",

The available data for an impending wave from 07/July/2021 to 17/August/2021 can be fitted with a logistic function of the form which however shows a large uncertainty when extrapolated until the middle of September. We therefore consider as two extremal cases logistic functions parametrised by (for more information see the Supplementary Material) Based on these values, we can develop a time-dependent SIIRV model, with time dependent parameters (\u03c3 1 , \u03b5) , which are shown in Fig. 6 . These curves follow the general form of Eq. (11) with the parameters www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Finally, implementing the Green pass model based on these extremal cases is shown in Fig. 7 . Starting from the band of cumulative number of infected individuals (for p = 1 ), we obtain a similar band for each p < 1 .

Notice, rather than the asymptotic number of infected individuals at the end of the wave, we have chosen a date roughly a months after the last available data for the comparison. The right panel shows which values of p V and p VT lead to the same cumulative number of infected individuals at t f : the red band corresponds to the uncertainty related to the two extremal cases we have developed to extrapolate the data. In fact, the extrema of this band arise when comparing the most optimistic extrapolation for the V-HP with the worst case approximation of VT-HP (and vice versa). The blue line corresponds to a comparison of equivalent extrapolations and suggests roughly This means, assuming that all other parameters remain roughly the same, the reduction in the contacts in the VT-HP needs to be roughly twice as large as in the V-HP-model to achieve the same cumulative number of infected.",

As in Germany, the available data from 01/July/2021 to 17/August/2021 show a great uncertainty when extrapolated until middle of September. We therefore again fit two extremal logistic functions of the form (17) , with the exact numerical data given in Section S6.3 of the Supplementary Material. These data suggest the onset of a new wave, just as in the case of Germany. However, unlike Germany, a VT-HP (3-G-rule: 'geimpft, getestet, genesen') was enforced on 01/ July/2021, with earlier measures dating as far back as 19/May/2021 (the rule was slightly modified on 22/07 and 15/08 specifying stricter rules to discotheques and nightclubs and imposing restrictions to only partially vaccinated individuals respectively, see the Supplementary Material for further details) allowing individuals full access to the public life only with a certificate of either being (fully) vaccinated, having recovered from a previous infection or having tested negative for SARS-Cov-2 . Therefore, in order to derive time-dependent parameters (\u03c3 1 (t), \u03b5(t)) for the above mentioned extremal cases, we need to take the presence of the V-HP into account. Since the exact efficacy of the HP are difficult to quantify, we have used p = 0.8 and p = 0.9 as reference values to fit the data. The corresponding time-dependent functions (\u03c3 1 (t), \u03b5(t)) for wave 4 are shown in Fig. 10 . As is evident, the main difference lies in the function \u03c3 1 , while the curve for \u03b5 is relatively unchanged. Indeed, as remarked before, mathematically the parameter p VT can be absorbed in the \u03b3 1 . Since we assumed for the latter anyway a certain range, the main effect of p VT can also be absorbed in the quotient \u03c3 2 /\u03c3 1 , i.e. the reduction in the rate at which vaccinated infectious individuals infect others. We next apply these time-dependent (\u03c3 1 , \u03b5) parameters to the stronger V-HP model (6) . The results are shown in Fig. 11 . The results again support an equivalence of the type (19) between the parameters p V of the V-HP and p VT of the VT-HP model.",

Analysing in particular the dependence of the asymptotic cumulative number of infected individuals (which is a crucial parameter in the description of the eRG), we have found the approximative exponential dependence (16) on the parameter describing the efficacy of the HP . Furthermore, comparing the efficacy of a VT-HP-model to a V-HP model reduces to comparing the corresponding \u03b8-parameters appearing in this approximation. We have furthermore validated our models by discussing the diffusion of COVID-19 in several European countries. We have analysed in detail Germany (who, to this date, has not implemented any HP) and Austria (who currently has implemented a VT-HP and considers the partial introduction of a V-HP) and have presented a briefer analysis for France, Denmark and Italy. In all cases we have established that a V-HP is much more efficient in reducing the number of infected. Our model in fact allows for a quantitative comparison, leading to the relation (19) : if all remaining parameters remain the same, the efficacy of a VT-HP needs to roughly be twice as high to produce the same reduction of infections as a V-HP . Furthermore in most cases, an efficiency of a V-HP of roughly 20-40% is strong enough to completely suppress a potential fourth wave.",
