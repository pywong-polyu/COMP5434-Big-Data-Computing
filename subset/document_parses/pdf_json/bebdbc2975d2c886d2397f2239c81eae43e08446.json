A sample of 101 Italian women recruited from the general population was evaluated a few weeks before the onset of the pandemic and during the first and the second wave of the pandemic. Depression values at the Brief Symptom Inventory showed an initial increase followed by a stabilization on higher values in respect to the baseline, whereas Phobic Anxiety was stably worsened. Participants with insecure attachment styles and childhood trauma showed higher levels of distress at all timepoints. In many psychopathological domains, moderation analysis showed an unfavorable trend over time for younger participants. The present study seems to confirm a high burden on mental health for women during the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting young age, insecure attachment style, and childhood trauma as negative prognostic factors.",

In fact, an impact by the generalized and prolonged conditions of insecurity was observed in several cross-sectional examinations for what concerns early-affected communities, e.g., Northern Italy and Mainland China (Fiorillo & Gorwood, 2020; Gloster et al., 2020; Hossain et al., 2020) . Discordant reports of worsened mental conditions during COVID-19 pandemic may be due to the high degree of heterogeneity in enrolled populations, in particular for vulnerable and understudied individuals, as in the case of young adults, children, adolescents, women, and elderly (Copeland et al., 2021; Gruber et al., 2021; Nearchou et al., 2020; Rettie & Daniels, 2021; Sep\u00falveda-Loyola et al., 2020) . In Italy, multiple sources highlighted increased rates of anxiety, depression, and feelings of distress -especially among those vulnerable and understudied populations already mentioned (Delmastro & Zamariola, 2020) . Indeed, worse outcomes have been described among women, younger adults, and those living alone (Benatti et al., 2020; Fiorillo & Gorwood, 2020; Giallonardo et al., 2020 ). Yet only a limited number of longitudinal studies has been reported in the literature. Even more rarely, descriptives of mental correlates before and after COVID-19 have been offered (Castellini et al., 2020 (Castellini et al., , 2021 Meda et al., 2021; Pierce et al., 2021) . The present study attempts to overcome some of the limitations in the existing literature, providing a three timepoint analysis of the evolution in the psychopathology in a population of Italian women.",

For instance, insecure attachment styles have been consistently associated to the onset of mental disorders or their worse outcome (Gumley et al., 2014; Pasalich et al., 2012) . Adult attachment styles can be defined as patterns of interpersonal behaviors and relational expectations that originate from the internalization of the quality of the interactions with caregivers during infancy (Fraley & Shaver, 2000; Shaver & Mikulincer, 2002) . When these interactions are negative, the individual may develop a so-called insecure attachment style, which is characterized by high levels of attachment anxiety or avoidance (Bowlby, 1973; Mikulincer & Shaver, 2012) . Attachment anxiety is characterized by a constantly activated state of vigilance, as a precautionary measure foreseeing the separation from partners or caregivers (Fraley et al., 2006) , whereas attachment avoidance is associated to the tendency to dismiss otherwise desired emotional connections and strives for self-reliance (Carvallo & Gabriel, 2006; Norris et al., 2012) . In contrast, secure attachment style is posited to result from the internalization of positive maternal/paternal models and is characterized by positive interpersonal expectations and functional emotion regulation strategies (Mikulincer & Shaver, 2007 . Relevantly, attachment patterns have been observed to moderate relationship functioning during COVID-19 quarantines, suggesting an erosion in success for social-oriented individual coping strategies (Overall et al., 2022) .",

Multiple studies confirmed the role of insecure attachment styles as a risk factor for mental disorders (Barnes & Theule, 2019; Dagan et al., 2018; Pallini et al., 2019) , and one metaanalysis in particular focused on the role of secure attachment as a core feature for psychological resilience (Darling Rasmussen et al., 2019) . Current results confirm that attachment patterns can moderate longitudinal trajectories of psychopathology, especially when considering the higher exposure to relationship conflicts, distance, or hastened cohabitation during the COVID-19 pandemic (Overall et al., 2022; Pietromonaco & Overall, 2021) . In fact, periods of quarantine or prolonged lockdowns might have stressed anxious individuals imposing protracted extents of time separated by partners or caregivers (Gruber et al., 2021) . As women were previously observed as more likely to adopt social-oriented coping strategies in comparison to males (M\u00e9lendez et al., 2012; Tamres et al., 2002) , longer isolation periods may have interfered with the successful management of harmful stress in this population. Furthermore, the coping mechanisms of individuals characterized by avoidant attachment styles may have been taxed by sustained and hastened co-habitation (Gruber et al., 2021) .",

Higher educational status was not significantly correlated with mental distress levels at baseline, and it did not moderate distress trajectories through time. Similarly, healthcare workers were not observed as exhibiting significantly different levels of distress either at baseline or subsequent follow-ups, in comparison to the other participants. Comparably, individuals working from home did not show significantly different levels of distress at baseline, and differential trajectories in mental health through time were also not observed in comparison to other participants.",

The authors' opinion is that the estimated effect on the general psychopathology was therefore biased towards a more neutral approximation. T2 was collected over a wider timespan as compared to T1 in order to enhance completion. The sample size was small, and mostly representative of a highly educated population, thus cautioning generalization to the broader community.",

Attachment insecurity and traumatic experiences were found to have a significant effect in the interplay between stress and stressors in the sample. Additional individual moderators were evaluated -educational status, being a healthcare worker, work from home -and none of these social determinants resulted significant for explaining longitudinal psychopathological trajectories. The clinical utility of the present study lies in the evidence of the role of attachment patterns and childhood traumatic experiences in the development and maintenance of mental distress during the COVID-19 pandemic. This evidence may warrant a future focus in the clinical setting for the collection of accurate personal history components, in order to better evaluate individual risk factors and to provide adequate treatment interventions.
