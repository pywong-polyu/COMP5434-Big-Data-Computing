However, it is unclear how many and for which clinical problems paediatric patients have an ED visit or HA in the first 3 days following discharge after ambulatory surgery in Ontario.

The purpose of this study was to examine ED use and HA in the first 3 days after ambulatory surgery in children (17 years or younger) in Ontario. Three days following surgery was chosen to capture healthcare use most likely to be associated with surgery rather than other factors. The aims of this study were to determine the proportion of ED use and HA in children after common ambulatory surgery procedures, identify the surgical groups and patient characteristics associated with higher ED use or HA, and describe the top five reasons for ED use overall and top five reasons for ED use by surgical group in children. A similar study was conducted examining ED use and HA in the first 3 days after ambulatory surgery in adults. 13 ",

One hundred and three (3.9%) children returned to the ED more than once, for a total of 2688 ED visits. The majority of ED visits occurred on postoperative day 1 (908; 35.1%) or 2 (881; 34%) (figure 1). Of the 2681 patients who visited the ED at least once, 72.4% underwent tonsillectomy (table 1) . Sixteen children who had a HA were admitted more than once, resulting in 616 HAs. Of the 606 patients who were admitted to hospital at least once, the majority underwent tonsillectomy (92.3%).",

The highest proportion of healthcare use was in children who underwent tonsillectomy. The main reason for ED use for all surgery types was unrelieved acute pain or haemorrhage, while the main reason for HAs was haemorrhage and dehydration. Our findings are similar to previously published studies that reported a readmission rate of 1% to 3.6% up to 30 days after surgery, with the majority of readmissions occurring between 3 and 7 days after surgery. 4-10 21 The most common reasons for requiring hospital care were also consistent with our findings and included pain, nausea and vomiting, dehydration and haemorrhage. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Gilani and Bhattacharyya reported that 4.5% of children who underwent tonsillectomy on an ambulatory basis had a hospital revisit due to acute pain, haemorrhage, nausea, vomiting and dehydration. 9 Our findings were similar with children who underwent tonsillectomy having a HA for similar reasons.

Language barriers and comorbid medical conditions made it more difficult for parents and children to adhere to the postoperative pain and hydration regimen they were provided. 11 In our study, the most common reason was for an ED visit due to unrelieved acute pain. Also, children in our sample had higher odds of ED use if they had two or more comorbid conditions. A US administrative database study reported the 30-day readmission rate following ambulatory paediatric cholecystectomy as 1.1%, with the most common reasons for readmission being persistent calculus in the biliary duct, abdominal pain and dehydration. 8 Gould and colleagues reported that 21% of children were admitted to hospital following cholecystectomy with 14% admitted for no identifiable reason. 7 Identifiable reasons for admission included pain and vomiting. 7 Similar to these studies, the reasons for admission or ED visits in our study were also pain and vomiting.

Guidelines for opioid prescribing to manage pain in children after surgery state that an optimal postoperative regimen should balance adequate pain control while also supporting recovery, including the return to school and sports. 22 23 Prescribers should use multimodal analgesia, including local anaesthetics, acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. Children and parents should be educated regarding the expectations regarding pain and methods of pain management, both before surgery and again in the postoperative period. Education should be delivered verbally and written in plain, non-medical terminology. 23 Dehydration is a potentially preventable adverse effect, and intravenous hydration protocols that aim to replace fluids lost during the nothing by mouth (NPO) time, intraoperative time and postoperative time can be helpful in decreasing ED visits after surgery. A quality improvement study that focused on intravenous hydration examined ED visits due to dehydration in children who underwent ambulatory tonsillectomy prior to and after the implementation of the protocol. 12 Younger patients and patients with pre-existing complex chronic conditions were at higher risk of dehydration. After the implementation of a hydration protocol, the ED visits due to dehydration decreased to 0.2% from 1%. 12 In our Open access study, 2.6% of children had an ED visit, and 5.9% had a HA due to dehydration. The implementation of hydration protocols for all paediatric ambulatory surgeries may be helpful in reducing these ED visits and HA.",
