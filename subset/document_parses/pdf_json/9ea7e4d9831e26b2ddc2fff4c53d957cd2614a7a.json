            "text": "For decades, the frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) -a disproportion in EEG alpha oscillations power between right and left frontal channels -has been one of the most popular measures of depressive disorders (DD) in electrophysiology studies. Patients with DD often manifest a left-sided FAA: relatively higher alpha power in the left versus right frontal lobe. Recently, however, multiple studies failed to confirm this effect, questioning its reproducibility. Our purpose is to thoroughly test the validity of FAA in depression by conducting a multiverse analysis -running many related analyses and testing the sensitivity of the effect to changes in the analytical approach -on data from five independent studies. Only 13 of the 270 analyses revealed significant results. We conclude the paper by discussing theoretical assumptions underlying the FAA and suggest a list of guidelines for improving and expanding the EEG data analysis in future FAA studies.

            "text": "Electrophysiological studies on frontal alpha asymmetry (FAA) in depressive disorders (DD) have almost 40 years of history, with first reports presented in 1983 (Schaffer et al., 1983) . Since then, many studies have reported relatively higher alpha band power in the left vs right frontal channels (left-sided FAA) in subjects suffering from DD compared to healthy individuals (Allen et al., 2004; Davidson, 1984; Davidson, 2004; Kemp et al., 2010; Schaffer et al., 1983) . FAA index, calculated by subtracting the left-side alpha power from the respective right-side channel, is one of the most common electrophysiological indicators of DD in the current literature (de Aguiar Neto and Rosa, 2019) . However, multiple studies failed to replicate the relationship between FAA and DD (Allen et al., 2004; Carvalho et al., 2011; Deldin and Chiu, 2005; Gold et al., 2013; Kaiser et al., 2018a; Kentgen et al., 2000; Knott et al., 2001; Mathersul et al., 2008; Szumska et al., 2021; Vuga et al., 2006) and conclusions of meta-analyses remain skeptical (Thibodeau et al., 2006; van der Vinne et al., 2017) . In this light statements about FAA being a biomarker of depression (Baskaran et al., 2012; Iosifescu et al., 2009 ) seem to be too far-fetched.",

While counter-balancing groups with respect to these variables can be difficult their effect may be accounted for by including them as predictors in the regression model.

            "text": "There are also other important methodological problems worth considering when trying to resolve the validity of FAA in DD. Although much attention in the FAA literature has been paid to the choice of EEG reference (see for example : Smith et al., 2017; or Stewart et al., 2014) other aspects of signal processing and analysis seem to be more neglected. Many EEG studies on FAA use and report FAA index calculated only for a few channel pairs (e.g. one or two pairs were used in 12 out of 17 studies [70.6%] included in the meta-analysis by van der Vinne et al., 2017) . In combination with the fact that topographical maps of effects are rarely presented (4/17 studies [23.5%] in van der Vinne et al., 2017) this significantly reduces the reliability and interpretability of the reported effects. The FAA effects are frequently assumed to reflect frontal sources of alpha oscillations but without a topographical map to support this claim it is difficult to conclude whether such interpretation is correct. For example, alpha asymmetry at frontal channels may, in principle, arise due to asymmetrical projection from other, non-frontal, sources. This could be identified in the topography, but not at the single channel pair's level. Without a topographical map it is also more difficult to assess the physiological reliability of the reported effect -significant effect on one channel pair without similar effects on surrounding channels calls for skeptical consideration . Therefore, it might be better to perform the analysis on many frontal channelpairs with relevant correction for multiple comparisons (for example, with the very popular clusterbased permutation approach, Maris and Oostenveld, 2007) . This is unfortunately rarely done in FAA studies on DDs (0/17 studies in van der Vinne et al., 2017) .",

For this reason it might be useful to perform source localization and continue the analyses in the source space. Given the assumption of frontal alpha sources of FAA presented in the literature, source level analysis would be appropriate. Regrettably, most FAA studies do not perform source localization, although there are notable exceptions (for example, Lubar et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2018) .",

As most neuroscience studies test only one analysis variant it is difficult to assess the robustness of any individual effect, and it seems that at least some neuroscientific findings are sensitive to the choice of signal analysis steps (Cohen, 2015; Cohen and Gulbinaite, 2014 ; see also Botvinik-Nezer et al., 2019) .",

For analyses controlling for confounds only 1 out of 60 was significant, which is also expected by chance, p=0.954, binomial test. We focus the description below on results from the analyses without control for confounds. Two of the significant results were found for the diagnosed vs healthy controls contrast (DvsHC) for the average referenced (AVG) F3-F4 channel pair in Study I and V. In Study I right-left alpha asymmetry was lower for the diagnosed group than for healthy controls, t = \u00c02.073, p=0.043 ( Figure 3A ). However, Study V showed the reverse: alpha asymmetry was higher for the diagnosed group compared to healthy controls, t = 2.823, p=0.007 ( Figure 3B ). Because we use right minus left alpha asymmetry only results with more negative asymmetry values in depressed individuals (negative t values) are congruent with the classical FAA effect. Table 3 .

We now examine the FAA-congruent result from Study I in a wider context, comparing it to the outcome of related analyses that differ in a single parameter. Applying CSD instead of average reference to the same channel pair did not reveal a significant result (same study, same contrast, F3-F4 pair, CSD reference, t = 0.132, p=0.896). The results were also not significant for the other channel pair, irrespective of reference (same study, same contrast, F7-F8 pair: average reference, t = \u00c00.365, p=0.717; CSD reference, t = 0.553, p=0.583). Performing the same analysis on data from Study III or IV also did not give rise to a significant outcome (same contrast, F3-F4 pair, AVG reference, Study III: t = 0.904, p=0.371; Study IV: t = 0.450, p=0.654). For Study II the DvsHC contrast was not available, but conceptually closest contrast -Sub-clinical vs Healthy Controls (SvsHC)was found insignificant for both channel pairs using either AVG or CSD reference.

The significant result for standard analyses corresponds to DvsHC contrast for the average referenced data in Study V (cluster p=0.026). This is the same analysis combination as the significant channel-pair result for Study V reported in the previous section. And just like in the previous section it represents a result that is not congruent with the classical FAA effect: the positive t values mean more positive right minus left FAA in depressed compared to healthy controls. We compare this effect to other analyses for DvsHC contrast in Figure 4 . We do not observe any other significant effect in standard cluster-based results: neither contrasting sub-clinical vs healthy controls nor looking for a linear relationship between FAA and depression questionnaire score. Although single channels sometimes pass the significance threshold (see n significant points column in Table 3 ) these effects are not significant at the cluster level. In other words the clusters formed by these channels were not convincingly stronger from clusters observed under the null hypothesis (that is, when permuting the data).",

On the other hand, one result close to the significance threshold in the standard analyses (DvsHC, Study I, AVG, cluster p=0.069) becomes significant after controlling for gender and age (p=0.023), which may be related to the difference in age between the depressed and the control group in this study (t = 2.73, p=0.0095). showing the between-group difference in the selected confounding variables.

Therefore it is worth considering that we just fail to detect this effect here. First, the FAA effect size may be too small to be reliably observed with a small to moderate sample size. The average number of participants per study is 78 in our case, but most analyses contain around 25 participants per group, which grants sufficient power to detect mostly large effects. Although single analyses reported here can be deemed inconclusive, the whole multiverse set of analyses is incompatible with the presence of moderate to strong relationship between FAA and DD. To strengthen this point we performed analyses on data aggregated across studies (see section Analyses on aggregated data) showing estimated effect sizes, their confidence intervals, and Bayes factors for the null hypothesis (see Figure 8 and Figure 8-figure supplement 1) . All confidence intervals for diagnosed vs healthy controls group contrast (DvsHC) and linear relationship between FAA and diagnosis score (allReg) exclude strong and moderate effects in the direction compatible with traditional FAA effect. Moreover, Bayes factors indicate that there is moderate evidence for the null hypothesis (or moderate to strong evidence for the null in allReg contrast). Although we cannot exclude a small FAA-DD relationship, if the effect was in this range then most published studies would have been underpowered to detect it. This line of thought is also supported in the meta-analysis by van der Vinne et al., 2017, which shows that studies with larger samples were less likely to report high effect sizes. For example, the largest EEG FAA study on a sample of 1008 DD patients and 336 controls did not confirm the diagnostic value of FAA in DD .

Clinical participants in Studies I, III, IV, and V and sub-clinical participants in Studies II and III manifested a wide range of DD symptoms indicated by BDI/PHQ-9 scores (see Figure 1 for BDI histograms), but regression analysis (DReg) did not reveal any relationship between FAA and BDI score in the aggregated analyses. This means that participants with stronger DD symptoms were not better characterized by a specific FAA pattern even when we controlled for confounding variables like age, gender, and education. However, given that 56 out of 102 participants (54.9%) in the aggregated clinical group were diagnosed with mild DD, it would be interesting to repeat the analyses presented here on a data set with more major DD patients. Smith et al., 2017 previously suggested that the relationship between FAA and DD is stronger when the participant is given some emotion-related task, as opposed to resting condition, where the task is unspecified. Although this is possible, we wanted to stay true to the design of most FAA-DD studies, which measure EEG during rest. An interesting approach for future studies would be to compare rest blocks separated by an emotional task (see, for example, Beeney et al., 2014) .",

Also the direction of the effect in almost all source results is consistent with the traditional FAA effect (negative t values). Finally, the same consistency of the effect direction can be observed in the source space analyses on aggregated data (see Table 10 , Figure 9 , and Figure 9 -figure supplement 1) -all source space vertices with an uncorrected significant effect show negative effect direction. The DvsHC and allReg contrasts on the aggregated data are at the trend level (p=0.077 and p=0.067, respectively) and it might seem that using more rigorous source localization (individual MRI scans and channel positions) could lead to a significant effect.

Because all the analyses with control for confounding variables that we have conducted control only for the main effect of gender, we additionally tested the presence of an interaction between gender and diagnosis (or depression score) in predicting FAA. This set of analyses were restricted only to the aggregated data with control for confounds. None of these analyses demonstrated a significant interaction effect (see A challenge for future FAA studies would be to move beyond a 'marker-only' approach, describe the theoretical assumptions behind FAA in more detail, and let these assumptions dictate an adequate analytical approach. For example, the assumption that FAA is a phenomenon with a source in the frontal cortex is impossible to address using only a few frontal channel pairs. Using source localization (like DICS Beamforming used here) or source separation (for example, spatial filtering with generalized eigendecomposition/common spatial pattern [Koles et al., 1990; Parra and Sajda, 2003; Tom\u00e9, 2006] ; or SPACE decomposition [van der Meij et al., 2015] ; Roemer [van der Meij et al., 2016] ) should be preferred when looking for the answer to this question. This point is important because frontal alpha sources are rarely measured reliably with EEG at the channel level: strong occipital and parietal alpha sources dominate alpha power recorded at frontal channels. As a result measuring FAA at the channel level could lead to poor signal to noise ratio and consequently to small effect size and low probability to observe a true FAA-DD relationship. On the other hand, if FAA does not originate in the frontal regions, it should be measured and interpreted differently. Such scenario is not unlikely because frontal alpha sources are generally difficult to detect with EEG/ MEG. For example, Roemer van der Meij et al., 2016, using an advanced source separation method, found that 86.6% of the alpha components detected across subjects were occipito-parietal and only 1% (4/380) were frontal. If frontal alpha sources are difficult to detect using a source separation method designed to capture oscillatory sources, then it is likely that these sources are rarely observed at the channel level at all.",

Our data and analyses cannot be conclusive in this regard because without a strong and reliable channel-level FAA-DD effect it is difficult to look for its source level correlate.

Half of the channel level analyses used CSD reference and the other half used average reference (AVG; see Tables 3-6 for a summary). For each data set the continuous signal from eyesclosed rest period was used, starting 2 s after rest onset to avoid potential artifacts related to eyes closing. Power spectra were calculated using Welch method with 2 s long windows and a window step of 0.5 s. Welch windows overlapping with bad signal segments were removed and all remaining windows were averaged. This operation was performed for every channel and every subject giving rise to subjects by channels by frequencies matrix. Alpha asymmetry was calculated by first averaging spectral power in 8-13 Hz band, log-transforming and then for each left-right channel pair subtracting values obtained for left sites from those for right sites.

Moreover, the alpha frequency range (8-13 Hz) was not averaged, and all frequency bins in this range were analyzed. Instead of right-left subtraction we standardized (z-scored) power in the selected channels by frequency space for each subject. Standardization should highlight asymmetry patterns that escape the traditional left vs right comparison, while also being sensitive to effects that do not rely on asymmetry at all.",

We first digitized channel positions for a representative subject from Study III using photogrammetry. This step was performed because the default channel positions for many EEG caps assume a spherical head, which is not a realistic assumption for source localization. A hand-held video camera was used to record EEG cap placement on the head of the representative subject from multiple angles. The recorded video was processed with 3DF Zephyr (3DFlow 3DF Zephyr, Aerial Education version: Toldo et al., 2015) in order to obtain a 3D model of the subject's head and EEG cap. Channels positions' coordinates were extracted by manually placing control points on each channel in the 3d reconstruction. After coregistering the digitized channel positions with the fsaverage FreeSurfer head model , see next paragraph) we confirmed that the chosen subject's head shape was very similar to the fsaverage head model. These digitized channel positions (and thus the coregistration with the fsaverage) were used for all subjects in Studies I, III, and IV. As a result in Studies I and IV data from a few channels were not included in the source localization because these channels were not present in the created digitization template. For Studies II and V default EGI channel positions were coregistered with the fsaverage model, because they assume a realistic head shape. We employed Boundary Element Method (BEM) for the forward problem. We first created a three-layer (inner skull, outer skull, and outer skin) BEM model based on the FreeSurfer fsaverage template Fischl et al., 1999) . Next, the leadfield was constructed for a grid of 8196 equidistant source points covering the whole fsaverage cortical surface. Finally we used beamforming (Dynamic Imaging of Coherent Sources, DICS: Gross et al., 2001 ) to infer the source-level activity in alpha band.",

Cluster-based permutation test is a nonparametric multiple comparison correction where the hypothesis of difference between conditions is evaluated at the level of multidimensional clusters. Clusters are formed by performing a chosen statistical test in the n-dimensional search space (channels or channels by frequencies in most of the analyses reported here) and grouping adjacent points where the test statistic passed some predefined threshold (typically an alpha level of 0.05). Each obtained cluster is then summarized by summing the statistics of all its members -that is, all adjacent points forming the cluster. These cluster summaries (cluster statistics) are then compared to a permutation null distribution of the maximum cluster statistic to obtain a p-value. The null distribution is approximated by a Monte-Carlo method where in each draw the condition labels are permuted between subjects (in this study: diagnosis status or BDI scores) and the statistical tests and clusters are computed in the same manner as for non-permuted data. As a result each Monte-Carlo draw produces cluster statistics from which the highest positive and the lowest negative value is saved. These values, when aggregated from all Monte-Carlo draws, constitute the null distribution for positive and negative effects to which cluster statistics from the actual analysis are compared.",
