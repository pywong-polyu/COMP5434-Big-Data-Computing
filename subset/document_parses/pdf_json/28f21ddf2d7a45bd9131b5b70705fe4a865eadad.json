Unfortunately, approximately 20% of CCS have at least one moderate late effect, and more than 10% have disabling life-threatening late effects [6] . Late effects are health problems or complications of cancer treatments that affect survivors physically and psychologically; these effects can develop months or years after the completion of cancer therapy [7] . Such late effects include cardiovascular, metabolic, skeletal, reproductive, and neurocognitive symptoms and disorders [6, 8, 9] . CCS must be counseled and continuously screened for long-term late effects of their specific therapies; however, many tend to be unaware of the potential late effects of cancer treatment during childhood, which could result in uncertainties such as risk of relapse and anxieties about life and death [10] [11] [12] . Duffey-Lind et al. [13] reported that young adult cancer survivors perceived a lack of support and information while transitioning off their cancer treatments. Other barriers to successful adjustments to post-cancer treatment include the difficult and abrupt transition from pediatric to adult health services, inconvenient and under-resourced health services, Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 8392 2 of 14 family doctors' inadequate experience with late effects management, and overdue and inadequate late effects communication with CCS [14] . Moreover, Hendriks et al. [15] explored unmet needs of CCS in long-term follow-up care and reported lack of psychosocial support, lack of collaboration and decentralization of care, and the need for centralized and individualized services for CCS.",

Further, these late effects can lead to difficulties in adjusting to life stages including education, marriage, childbirth, and employment [16] [17] [18] . Because the treatment during childhood can also affect growth, and cause reproductive and sexual development problems, the CCS' perceptions of their bodies could lead to emotional challenges, low self-esteem, poor quality of life, and difficulties in social functioning [19] [20] [21] . However, experiencing childhood cancer is not entirely negative. In fact, the trauma of experiencing childhood cancer can promote growth in CCS. Life-threatening illnesses may provide positive outcomes such as prosperity, self-renewal, resilience, and achievement of personal and emotional growth that enhance quality of life [22] [23] [24] .",

Yet, this prior research was fractional and used generic quantitative measures, which limited the ability of CCS to report real experiences that are significant to them [26] . CCS' voices are scarcely found in literature related to the real experiences of late effects, how these impact on daily life, and what CCS can do to cope with them.

First, we posted online advertisement on the webpages of CCS self-help groups and Korean Association for Children with Leukemia and Cancer (KACLC) to recruit participants. Second, participants were encouraged to send the advertisement to other known CCS. Participants who met the eligibility criteria and were interested in participating provided their contact information through a registration link. A total of 18 CCS registered. The first author contacted participants to provide information regarding the study's purpose and interview procedures and reconfirmed whether they met the selection criteria. Three participants were excluded from the study due to their current age being less than 19 years (1 case), experiencing no existing late effects (1 case), and not being diagnosed with childhood cancer (1 case).

Interviews were conducted according to a semi-structured interview guide developed through a literature review and research team discussion (refer to the Supplementary Table S1 ). The guided interview consisted of an introduction to break the ice; interview questions on experiences of late effects; member checking, if necessary; a summary; and closing remarks. The interviewer used open-ended questions and targeted probes to guide participants, allowing them to speak freely about their experiences of the late effects. Participants were encouraged to recall and describe specific experiences related to their coping and management strategies for the late effects, including the challenges with and opportunities gained from these strategies. As the interview progressed, redundant probes were removed, and new questions based on emerging themes in the initial interviews were added. Interviews lasted between 60 and 90 min and were conducted once per participant. All interviews were digitally recorded and subsequently transcribed verbatim by a research assistant. The first and second authors reviewed the transcripts against the recorded audio files to ensure accuracy and remove participants' identifiers. Interviews were completed and analyzed simultaneously to inform following interviews. Interviews continued until saturation was achieved when no new themes emerged.",

Participants sought solutions by searching the Internet; however, they were often unsuccessful in finding answers. They searched for information on the same symptoms, specifically for CCS, and information related to the experiences of other CCS. However, no information was available.

Participants noted that they did not receive sufficient explanation from the health care providers regarding the late effects that may occur after treatment. Participants mentioned the importance of discharge education about the late effects upon the completion of cancer treatment so that they are aware of symptoms and prepared for their occurrence. In addition, although the CCS had regular follow-ups after treatment, the appointment durations were too short, and the health care providers were often so busy that the CCS could not discuss their late effects. When CCS consulted their doctors about their late effects, doctors were unhelpful and only responded with: \"It is ok. That is normal,\" and \"You just have to live with it.\" Participants often received treatment from departments other than oncology due to late effects such as infertility, decreased renal function, hormone imbalance, and hip dysplasia.

They were not notified of the possibility of infertility prior to their treatment processes even though CCS have been found to have a 50% increased risk of infertility, compared to healthy controls [36] . In the United States, the American Society for Clinical Oncology recommends that healthcare providers discuss the risks of infertility and provide information about fertility preservation [37] . It is known that understanding one's own disease and treatment is closely related to a higher quality of life [38] and receiving specific counseling about potential reproductive loss and fertility preservation is associated with less regret and higher quality of life for cancer survivors [39] . However, no guideline is available in Korea to discuss the late effects of childhood cancer treatment. Moreover, discussion about late effects, such as infertility, may not be a priority for healthcare providers during active and emotionally challenging treatment periods. Nevertheless, our participants indicated the need for early information about late effects during treatment periods or follow-up appointments (refer to subtheme \"Not helpful at all\"). In the Korean healthcare system, oncologists or hematologists are the first point of contact during active and followup periods. It is, therefore, important that these healthcare providers are trained about late effects and how and when to communicate relevant information about them. The experience of late effects may differ for each childhood cancer survivor. The development of tailored survivorship care plans that could monitor and inform survivors and healthcare providers about possible late effects and long-term effects of cancer treatment, as well as provide instructions for follow-up care that includes the management of late effects, are necessary for CCS in Korea.",

A child's serious illness may be a challenging for parents and the perception of their child's vulnerability to a cancer relapse may impede the healthy development of a child-parent relationship [40, 41] . Parental stress post-cancer treatment of the child has been associated with high levels of anxiety, depression, fear of recurrence, worry, and fatigue [42] [43] [44] , and may further lead to parental overprotection [45] . Research found that family and parental factors play important roles in the health outcomes of CCS; parental distress was associated with overprotective behavior and interfered with the quality of life of CCS [46] . In fact, the overprotection due to the worry of parents was found to have led to conflicts between CCS and parents in our study (refer to subtheme \"Worsening my situation\"). Overprotection may have a negative influence on CCS achieving their independence and autonomy [46] . In addition, parental overprotection may also lead to a reduction in time spent with peers and social isolation [47] . However, parental distress and the psychological states of parents of CCS is underestimated and rarely studied in Korea. Qualitative approaches to explore the parents' distress and psychosocial needs, describe the relationship between parents and CCS, and explore the mechanisms between parental distress and overprotective behaviors during treatment, as well as survivorship periods, are needed. We also recommend developing early monitoring and counseling for both CCS and their parents to identify problems and early interventions to build healthy relationships.",

            "text": "Cancer survivors might be discriminated against and rejected in society because of the stigma attached to cancer and cancer survivorship [48] . Cancer survivors are prone to public stigma because cancer treatment may lead to visible physical and developmental outcomes such as hair loss, scarring, and a small frame [49] [50] [51] [52] . Researchers reported that public stigma is associated with depression and subjective wellbeing in cancer patients [53] [54] [55] . Public stigma is particularly important for CCS as many returned to school after periods of social isolation due to cancer treatment. Childhood cancer treatment may influence the social functioning and peer relationships of CCS as they are seen by their peers as sick, fatigued, and absent from school [56, 57] . Ignorance of teachers and peers may add to the stress experienced by CCS when returning to school [58] , and abuse and taunting from their peers were reported due to changes in the physical appearance of CCS; this can further lead to a low self-esteem, reduced social interactions, and self-induced isolation of CCS [59] . Public education is vital to reduce the stigma of childhood cancer and CCS, but it may show delayed effect. Meanwhile, it would be helpful to provide supportive environments to CCS, such as support groups with other CCS who can share their positive experiences with social adjustment [48] . Social support is known to be a protective factor against stress and, therefore, important in the lives of cancer patients [48] . In our study, CCS reported that they received emotional comfort from other CCS (refer to subtheme \"People were there when I needed them\"). For young survivors, peer support groups can be beneficial because they allow CCS the opportunity to share similar experiences and their coping strategies, especially when many Koreans do not feel comfortable disclosing their cancer diagnosis [60] . Yet, there is a limited number of peer support groups available in Korea and we believe more should be organized by hospitals that have close contacts with CCS and non-profit organizations. We also recommend that future research related to specific factors leading to peer difficulties and social isolation should be conducted to develop further interventions or programs for CCS. Public education about cancer and its late effects is crucial; however, it would take some time to have an effect. An educational program and campaigns for the public, including schoolteachers, about cancer and its late effects would be a good start and beneficial in the future.",

CCS who sublimated their experiences talked about their spiritual growth during and after cancer treatment. Survivors of traumatic events such as being diagnosed with cancer and going through painful treatment processes try to understand the stressor, and spirituality plays an important role in coping with such events [61, 62] . In our previous research, we have also found a positive relationship between spiritual growth and quality of life among CCS [63] . Our participants reported that they were positively influenced by mentors and parents who had children with childhood cancer during their survivorship periods, which indicates the importance of providing support after cancer treatment completion. However, we know little about the role of spirituality among CCS and which factors influence spiritual growth and positive sublimation, especially in Korea; therefore, we recommend further quantitative research and the future development of intervention programs based on the factors associated with spiritual growth and positive sublimation.",

Selection bias could be present as we recruited the majority of participants from the KACLC. Although we tried to recruit a more varied pool of participants using the snowballing technique, the majority of participants had leukemia or lymphoma. Recruiting CCS in Korea is often difficult, as many CCS may be reluctant to reveal their medical/cancer history. Moreover, because the participants were in their 20s, the experiences of older survivors need to be explored further.

Our study findings provide a basis for future studies in several ways: First, it is necessary to develop tailored survivorship care plans that can monitor and inform both CCS and health care providers about the late effects of childhood cancer treatment. Second, developing counseling programs for both CCS and their families would be useful for building healthy relationship and socialization. Lastly, researchers need to develop interventions that could reinforce the positive experiences associated with late effects, such as spiritual growth and outreach.
