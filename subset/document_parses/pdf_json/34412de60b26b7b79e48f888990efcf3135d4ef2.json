Methods: We investigate the role of the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) Erk1/2 and p38 in an in vitro model of the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB) based on human epithelial choroid plexus (CP) papilloma (HIBCPP) cells during infection with Nm serogroup B (NmB) and serogroup C (NmC) strains. A transcriptome analysis of HIBCPP cells following infection with Nm by massive analysis of cDNA ends (MACE) was done to further characterize the cellular response to infection of the barrier.",

The transcriptome analysis of HIBCPP cells following infection with Nm demonstrated specific regulation of genes involved in the immune response dependent on Erk1/2 signalling. Gene ontology (GO) analysis confirmed loss of MAPK signalling after Erk1/2 inhibition and revealed an additional reduction of cellular responses including NF\u03baB and JAK-STAT signalling. Interestingly, GO terms related to TNF signalling and production of IL6 were lost specifically following Erk1/2 inhibition during infection with wild type Nm, which correlated with the reduced infection rates by the wild type in absence of Erk1/2 signalling.",

To cause meningitis, Nm needs to enter the central nervous system (CNS), which is well protected from pathogens due to the presence of protective barriers, such as the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BCSFB). Nm has been proposed to cross these protective barriers of the brain, the BBB and the BCSFB, to reach the inner and outer cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . There is evidence that, during an infection, Nm can interact with the BCSFB, whose morphological correlate are the epithelial cells of the choroid plexus (CP) [8] . In an in vitro model of the BCSFB, which is based on human choroid plexus papilloma (HIBCPP) cells, Nm have been shown to interact, enter and transmigrate across the epithelial cell layer following infection from the physiologically relevant basolateral side [3, 4] .",

The polysaccharide capsule has been described as the main virulence factor of Nm and is a major contributor to meningococcal disease. It is essential for bloodstream survival and masks the function of non-pilus adhesins [9] . The capsule of Neisseria strains associated with invasive diseases has been shown to contain sialic acid, with the Nm serogroup B (NmB) owning a \u03b12-8-linked N-acetylneuraminic acid, and the Nm serogroup C (NmC) presenting \u03b1 2-9-linked partially O-acetylneuraminic acid [10] . However, adhesion and invasion of host tissues is attenuated by the capsule as was shown for the capsulated Nm serogroup B strain (NmB) MC58 during infection of HIBCPP cells. In this model system, the capsule-deficient mutant (MC58siaD \u2212 ) on the other hand, displayed higher invasion rates than the wild type strain [3, 4] . Changes in capsule expression, such as hypo-or hyperencapsulation, capsule \"switching\" and acetylation, can lead to immune escape and the loss or downregulation of the capsule has been shown to not only facilitate attachment to host cells, but also the formation of microcolonies and the carriage state at human mucosal surfaces [11] .",

Emphasis was put on the role of the capsule during infection of Nm strains of the serogroups B and C. We show that both Erk1/2 and p38 are required for infection of the HIBCPP cells by the Nm wild type strains. In contrast, inhibition of MAPK activity revealed a variable impact on infection by capsule-depleted strains. Interestingly, Erk1/2 inhibition caused an increased infection by the capsule-deficient NmB mutant. Subsequently, we determined the transcriptome of HIBCPP cells after infection with the NmB strains with a special focus on the Erk1/2 signalling cascade during infection. The induction of an inflammatory response following infection was regulated in a capsule and Erk1/2 dependent manner. Loss of GO terms related to TNF signalling and production of IL6 following Erk1/2 inhibition during infection with wild type Nm correlated with the reduced infection of HIB-CPP cells by the wild type in absence of Erk1/2 signalling. Our data underline capsule-dependent infection mechanisms of Nm in HIBCPP cells as well as a central role of Erk1/2 signalling during infection and point towards a fine-tuned inflammatory response influenced by capsule expression and Erk1/2 signalling.",

The confluency of the cell layer and barrier integrity of the cells were determined by measuring the transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) using an epithelial voltohmmeter, the Millicell-ERS STX-2 electrode system (Millipore, Schwalbach, Germany), and by measuring the paracellular permeability of the HIBCPP cells on the filter inserts by adding a FITC-inulin tracer solution (100 mg mL \u22121 ; Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany) to the filter compartment of the inserts. Passage of the FITC-Inulin to the lower compartment over the course of the experiment was measured using a Tecan Infinite M200 Multiwell reader (Tecan, Switzerland) as previously described [26] . The confluent cell layer has approximately 4 \u00d7 10 5 cells per filter insert.",

After formaldehyde fixation (3.7%), the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor \u00ae 594 donkey anti-Mouse; 1:500; Life Technologies) was added for visualization. Permeabilization with PBS/0.5% Triton X-100/1% bovine serum albumin was used to allow detection of intracellular Nm additionally to extracellularly adhered bacteria with antibody P1.7 (1:1000), followed by staining with the secondary antibody (Alexa Fluor \u00ae 488 donkey anti-Mouse; 1:500; Life Technologies), along with addition of 4\u2032,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI; Calbiochem, Darmstadt, Germany) (1:50,000) for visualization of nuclei and staining of the actin cytoskeleton with Alexa Fluor 660 phalloidin (1:250; Life Technologies).

To determine the impact of Erk1/2 signalling on gene expression during infection of the CP epithelium with Nm, the transcriptome of HIBCPP cells after infection with NmB was characterized using a MACE approach. Special emphasis was put on the difference between the wild type strain MC58 and the capsuledeficient mutant MC58siaD \u2212 . The HIBCPP cells were infected with the two Nm strains (MOI 10) for 6 h in the inverted filter culture system in presence and absence of the Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126. RNA was isolated as described and the RIN was determined before the preparation of the libraries, followed by sequencing and bioinformatic processing.",

A selection of the most overrepresented GO Terms is given in Table 6 . During infection of HIBCPP cells with the NmB strains, the most significantly overrepresented GO terms are pointing towards a role of the CP epithelial cells in the inflammatory response. These include the terms \"cellular response to lipopolysaccharide\", \"cellular response to molecule of bacterial origin\" and \"cytokine-mediated signalling pathway\". The regulation of cellular signalling pathways during infection was described by terms such as \" NIK/NF-kappaB signalling\" during infection with both NmB strains, as well as a regulation of the MAPK signalling pathways, represented by the terms \"positive regulation of MAPK cascade\" and the \"regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade\". The GO terminus, describing the negative regulation of IL6 production (\"negative regulation of interleukin-6 production\"), was overrepresented for both NmB strains. Another GO term, which was overrepresented during the infection with both NmB strains, describes the \"negative regulation of cell death\". The GO termini identified during Nm infection of HIB-CPP cells pre-treated with the Erk1/2 inhibitor U0126 revealed that, similar to untreated cells, GO terms indicating a role of the CP epithelial cells in the inflammatory response were overrepresented. Some of the GO terms that had been identified after infection of the nontreated cells were no longer found after inhibition of Erk1/2. These included GO termini indicative of manipulation of MAPK signalling pathways (\"MAPK cascade\", \"positive regulation of MAPK cascade\", \"regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade\"), underscoring the function of the inhibitor during the experiments. Furthermore, the GO terms \"signal transduction by protein phosphorylation\" and \"JAK-STAT cascade\" were no longer identified.",

The MAPK signalling pathways convert extracellular signals into cellular responses, which, upon challenge with a pathogen, are activated and lead to a subsequent expression of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines [36, 37] . Furthermore, MAPK function can be exploited by pathogens to their benefit [37] . However, the role of MAPK during infection with Nm is still largely unknown, especially with regards to the BCSFB. We determined a moderate activation of Erk1/2 in response to the infection with Nm. This stands in contrast to the infection of the HIBCPP cells with Lm, which induced a stronger activation of Erk1/2 [14] . The MAPK p38 on the other hand, displayed a pronounced activation by all Nm strains of serogroups B and C, with a stronger phosphorylation being observed after infection with the NmB strains. In HBMEC, an in vitro cell culture system of the BBB, activation of MAPK p38 and JNK after infection with the NmB wild type strain MC58 and its capsule-deficient mutant has already been described [15] . However, we did not observe an activation of JNK after infection with Nm (data not shown), indicating differential involvement of MAPK pathways at the BBB and BCSFB.",

Both inhibitors have a high selectivity, which has been proven in several studies [38, 39] . The inhibition of the Erk1/2 signalling during infection of HIBCPP cells resulted in a significant reduction of the intracellular bacteria of the NmB and NmC wild type strains. This correlates with the results of Dinner et al., which describe a dependence of the infection of Lm in HIBCPP cells on Erk1/2 signalling [14] . In HBMEC a role of the p38 and JNK signalling pathways during infection with Nm could be observed, however not the activation of Erk1/2 [15] , again pointing to specific activation of MAPK pathways at the BCSFB and BBB, respectively.",

            "text": "In order to investigate the influence of the polysaccharide capsule under the same experimental conditions, infections of HIBCPP cells were also carried out with the capsule-deficient mutants of the Nm strains. Both capsule-deficient mutants of the NmB and NmC strains displayed an increased number of intracellular bacteria in HIBCPP cells, with only MC58siaD \u2212 displaying a significant increase of infection rates, after inhibition of the Erk1/2 signalling pathway. This is in stark contrast to the wild-type strains and suggests that the capsule of the pathogen may cover important virulence factors that can influence the infection mechanism of the pathogen. We previously detected capsule-dependent endocytosis mechanisms of Nm in HIBCPP cells involving actin related protein 2/3 (Arp2/3) and possibly dynamin, which could further impact downstream signalling [40] . It requires further investigation to determine to which extend MAPKs influence these mechanisms. Lower infection rates of the NmB and NmC wild type strains compared to the capsule-deficient mutants have already been described [3, 4] and could also be confirmed in this work [41, 42] . In addition, in a study using macrophages infected with the Gram-negative bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, no effect on the number of intracellular bacteria was found after inhibition of the Erk1/2 signalling pathway compared to untreated, infected cells [43] . Interestingly, clinical application of Erk inhibitors has been suggested in the context of cancer therapy and treatment of neurological disorders as well as being discussed as a target during viral infections [44] [45] [46] [47] . Furthermore, inhibition of Erk signalling has resulted in exacerbated SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro [48] , underscoring the importance of understanding the differential regulation of this signalling pathway during infection. Both wild type strains of the Nm serogroups B and C displayed significantly reduced infection rates in HIB-CPP cells after p38 inhibition. However, a significant reduction in the number of intracellular bacteria of the NmC capsule-deficient mutant in HIBCPP cells could be observed, but no significant change in the infection rates for the NmB capsule-deficient mutant could be determined after inhibition of p38 signalling. The combination of both inhibitors resulted in a significant decrease of infection rates for the Nm wild type strains, but no significant change in infection rates could be observed for the capsule-deficient mutants. Taken together, the role of Erk1/2 and p38 signalling differs during infection of HIB-CPP cells by wild type and capsule-depleted Nm, with inhibition of Erk1/2 leading to rather opposite effects on wild type and mutant bacteria.",

The recognition and elimination of pathogens is another crucial step during host defence and can result in further release of signalling molecules [32, 49] . In this context, the onset of inflammation acts as an unspecific mechanism early on in response to an infection to limit the spread of the pathogen as well as activating and attracting immune cells [37] . It is known that activation of signalling events induced by bacteria is linked to the modulation of the cytokine response of infected macrophages and epithelial cell lines [14, 15, [50] [51] [52] [53] . Among other mechanisms, the MAPK are involved in the induction and regulation of the inflammatory response [37] , and pathogens can modulate the inflammatory response in host cells and induce anti-inflammatory cytokines by selective Erk1/2 signalling [54] .",

            "text": "The MACE analysis identified several genes that were regulated after infection with NmB specifically in the absence or presence of the inhibitor U0126. In the case of Erk1/2 inhibition after infection with the wild type strain, nine regulated genes were identified, of which seven were also regulated after infection with the capsule-deficient mutant when Erk1/2 was inhibited. Some of the seven genes are involved in the inflammatory response, including CXCL10, IL4I1, and Adrenomedullin (ADM). ADM helps maintain vascular integrity and stabilizes the BBB, possibly through a regulatory effect on the expression of claudin 5 [75] . An increased expression of ADM was found in HBMEC and HIBCPP cells after infection, as well as in plexus carcinoma cells [4, 67, 76] . ADM is of particular interest because it has an anti-microbial effect against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria [77, 78] and its release presumably combats the pathogenic agents. In addition, it was observed in vivo that ADM can bind complement factor H, a negative regulator of the complement cascade. The resulting inhibition of complement activation protects the brain from damage [75] . The release of ADM can also activate G-proteincoupled receptors, which act via cAMP/PKA signalling pathways. This results in a reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as an increased expression of anti-inflammatory cytokines and a reduced activation of immune cells [77] . Interestingly, the capsule-deficient mutant specifically regulates 14 further genes in case of Erk1/2 inhibition, including nos2, tnfrsf11b and the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (PLAU), which belongs to the PLAU receptor (PLAUR) system. PLAU has a pro-inflammatory effect and was detected in the CSF of patients with bacterial meningitis [69] . Overall, our gene expression data largely recapitulated previously detected gene expression following infection with Nm, including the described upregulation of nf\u03babiz and il6 [4] . The specific regulation of genes dependent on active or inactive Erk1/2 signalling points out that MAPKs impact the host cell response at the CP epithelium during infection with Nm. Similarly, importance of the p38 MAPK pathway for the control of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 has been shown previously following infection of HBMEC with Nm [15] . Further studies are needed to analyse to which extend specifically regulated genes play a role during Erk1/2 regulation of HIBCPP cell infection by Nm.",

Wild type and the capsule-depleted mutant of NmB invade into HIBCPP cells representing the CP epithelium, with the mutant strain displaying higher invasion rates. Infection of HIBCPP cells by Nm leads to activation of the MAPKs Erk1/2 and p38. Inhibition of Erk1/2 and p38 with U0126 or SB203580, respectively, differentially influences the invasion by the different Nm strains. Whereas inhibition of Erk1/2 or p38 signalling reduces invasion by the wild type, invasion by the mutant is enhanced following inhibition of Erk1/2. Infection with wild type or capsule depleted Nm causes specific regulation of inflammatory response genes in the host cells, which is influenced by inhibition of Erk1/2. The impact on host cell processes cells was determined GO analysis. GO terms pointing to certain cellular processes, as production of IL-6 or regulation of TNF production, are lost specifically following Erk1/2 inhibition during infection with wild type Nm detected when the DEG of the untreated conditions were analysed. In addition, the terms \"signal transduction by protein phosphorylation\" and \"JAK-STAT cascade\" were not detected in untreated conditions. Interestingly, after Erk1/2 inhibition and infection of HIBCPP cells with the NmB strains, GO termini indicating an involvement of the NF-\u03baB signalling pathway, a function of IL6, and a role of the tumour necrosis factor, were underrepresented compared to the untreated cells. It remains to be determined which role these cellular functions play in regulating the infection of HIBCPP cells by the MAPK signalling pathways. This underrepresentation of GO termini was more pronounced after infection with the wild type strain, which could explain the differential impact of U0126 on infection of HIBCPP cells by the wild type and the capsule-deficient mutant. The GO terms \"regulation of NIK / NF\u03baB signalling\" and \"interleukin-6 production\" were determined for Erk1/2 inhibition only after infection with the capsule-deficient mutant, but not the wild-type strain. Activation of NF\u03baB in HIBCPP cells and NF\u03baB-induced expression of inflammatory reaction genes, including il6, after infection with Nm has already been shown [4] . Furthermore, the GO terms \"regulation of tumour necrosis factor production\" and \"regulation of tumour necrosis factor superfamily cytokine production\" were identified in the case of Erk1/2 inhibition only after infection with the capsule-deficient mutant. The role of these processes during infection of HIBCPP cells by NmB requires further investigation.",

To this end, host cell signalling cascades such as the MAPK signalling cascades are manipulated and the host immune defence needs to be downregulated, while the host cell should remain healthy enough to gain nutrition [81] . During this process, bacterial effectors are crucial for targeting the host immune response at different levels with a variety of bacterial effectors mimicking host enzymes or featuring novel enzymatic functions, resulting in an overall manipulation of host cell signalling and the immune response [14, 81] . However, these complex interaction mechanisms and networks are still not completely understood. Furthermore, pathogens have been demonstrated to target different pathways simultaneously or one pathway with several effectors. Therefore, gaining further insight into the complex manipulation of host cell signalling pathways and immune response during infection will help combat infections [81] . Pharmacological inhibition of the p38 MAPK pathways in vivo and in vitro has previously been shown to effectively suppress viral replication and release, and the use of p38 inhibitors in clinical development was suggested to be trialled in COVID-19 patients, further underlining the importance of understanding the manipulation of MAPK pathways during infection for development of therapeutic approaches [82] [83] [84] .",

Inhibition of the Erk1/2 and p38 signalling pathways by specific inhibitors. HIBCPP cells grown in the inverted culture system and infected for 4 h with the NmB strain MC58siaD -(Nm). Untreated cells were used as controls. The activation of Erk1/2 was inhibited by adding 25 \u03bcM of the inhibitor U0126 (U) and detected using an immunoblot (A). The cells treated with PMA served as positive controls. Phosphorylation of p38 was inhibited by SB203580 (SB) at a concentration of 25 \u03bcM. The functionality of the inhibitor was examined using an immunoblot of the p38 target protein MAPKAPK-2 (B). Treatment with anisomycin (Aniso) was used as positive control.Additional file 2. Summary of DEG determined by MACE Analysis of the transcriptome of HIBCPP cells during infection with Nm. The DEG were determined by comparing the control conditions (con, con + U0126) with the corresponding treated, infected cells. The lists shown here were filtered for a FDR p-value of < 0.05 as well as a fold change of +/-4 (log 2 fold change +/-2).Additional file 3. GO lists determined by the use of the software LAGO.
