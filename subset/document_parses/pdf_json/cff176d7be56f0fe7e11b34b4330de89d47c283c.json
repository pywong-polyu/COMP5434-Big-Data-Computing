The need to increase capacity and reorganise health care departments has become rapidly apparent as the number of potentially infected patients is on the increase. Since the beginning of the pandemic, hospitals have been continuously overcrowded, with several observed waves of infected cases and hospitalisations. For example, in Belgium, nearly 7500 beds were occupied in hospitals, including more than 1400 in intensive care, for a maximum of 2800 beds, a capacity that was increased during this period, which is a record during the second wave in November 2020 [3] . To avoid at maximum this overcrowding and to take care of the patients in the best possible way, Emergency Departments (EDs) need to have efficient tools to confirm the diagnosis of COVID- 19 .",

This test has the advantage to be realised quickly with proving high sensitivity, but with observed false-negative results [5, 6] , and can produce results in 3-4 h [7] . Unfortunately, in practice and due to a high number of tests realised, the waiting time for the results is generally longer, up to more than 24 h in hospitals. As suggested by Soedarsono et al. [5] to prevent the false-negative results, a combination of qRT-PCR with clinical, radiological or serological examinations could further support the clinicians in the triage of patients at high risk of COVID-19.",

Results from our systematic review are already available and published in Archives of Public Health and entitled \"A systematic review of prediction models to diagnose COVID-19 in adults admitted to healthcare centers\" [10] . This paper presents the selected models that will be validated in the present study. The evaluation of these models will be based on criteria of performance indicators as discrimination and calibration measures. Several agreement indexes will be also computed for purposes of model comparison. Moreover, as mentioned above, the employed database incorporated a lot of information over two complete waves (from March to June 2020 and from September 2020 to January 2021) of COVID-19 infected cases in Belgium and allowed the construction of alternative models to perform sensitivity analyses. In so doing, the results achieved are to provide an overview of the latest models as a basis for decision making, to guide and advance further studies in COVID-19 model development, and to confirm and/or verify the conclusions from Wynants et al. [8] that all COVID-19 diagnostic models to date are poorly developed or useless. Finally, some easy-to-use models could be highlighted to help clinicians classify patients at high risk of COVID-19.",

Each study proposed diagnostic models for COVID-19 based on socio-demographics, clinical symptoms, blood tests, or other characteristics that were compared to the qRT-PCR test. The number of variables included in the model varied from 4 to 15. The presence of fever appeared in 7 models, the blood value of eosinophils in 6 models, and C-reactive protein (CRP) in 5 models. Four studies included comorbidities, gender (male) or chest X-ray as a predictor in their models. Finally, age, cough, white blood cells (WBC) were significant predictors in three out of 13 studies and lymphocytes was present in two out of the 13 studies. It can be noted that some variables can be directly collected while others require more time for their investigation. Sample sizes varied from 100 to 172 754 subjects and most studies were conducted at a single site or institution. Most of the models were developed using logistic regressions. From these logistic regressions, some authors developed a score and derived cut-off values. Models such as XGBoost, random forest and machine learning were also applied. All presented classification measures, with a wide range of sensitivity and specificity values depending on the model and 12 presented a discrimination measure. All models performed well to identify patients at risk of COVID-19 but only one proceeds to an external validation. The risk of bias was estimated as low for all models using the PROBAST tool [11] .",

Data were collected during the period from March 2, 2020, to January 31, 2021. The number of patients was 8033. This period primarily covered two complete waves of cases and patient admissions in Belgium [3] : from March 2020 to June 2020 (wave 1) and from September 2020 to January 2021 (wave 2). Socio-demographic information (age and gender) as well as comorbidities (cardiac disease, immunosuppression, renal failure), symptoms (fever, dry or wet cough, dyspnea, diarrhea), blood parameters (lactic acid dehydrogenase LDH, CRP, procalcitonin, lymphocytes or lymphocytes count ALC, basophils, ferritin, leukocytes, neutrophils or neutrophils count ANC), radiology exams, particularly chest X-ray results, were collected in the database. Socio-demographic information and clinical symptoms were factors easily available at ED's admission whereas hospital diagnostic resources required a more important time-to-results. In addition, radiological resources were not recommended to all patients, as their clinical presentation could not require this type of work-up. The outcome was confirmed or unconfirmed COVID-19 case using a qRT-PCR. Two different qRT-PCR tests were used during these periods: one adapted from the protocol described by Corman et al. [19] ; and a second was a commercial assay using the cobas \u00ae 6800 platform (Roche) [18] . Patients for whom no qRT-PCR test was realised, aged < 18 years and for whom no biological parameters were not included in the analysis, representing 80% of the original dataset.",

Results were reported with calibration slopes and intercept (calibration-in-the-large). A perfect calibration slope is equal to 1 while slopes < 1 indicate an underestimation of low risk and overestimation of high risk and slopes > 1 means underestimation of high risk and overestimation of low risk. The estimated regression intercept represents the overall miscalibration, where 0 indicates good calibration, > 0 denotes an average underestimation, and < 0 denotes an average overestimation [23] .

It could be explained by the missing information about one variable (highest FiO 2 ) to reconstruct the logistic regression model and that had to be replaced by the median value mentioned in the original article. Despite another missing information to calculate score derived from Aldobyany et al. [15] , the obtained AUROC value in this study was similar. The missing information concerned the exposure risk and counted for 3 points out of 11. Globally, results remained acceptable but were excellent or outstanding in the original articles. For the binary regression models, all showed a good calibration with calibration intercept equal to 0 but two models tended to overestimate high risk while one tended to underestimate it. The Brier scores showed poor accuracy but they did not always perform well to evaluate clinical utility of diagnostic performance of these prediction models as mentioned in [40] . When comparing diagnostic tests results for these two studies, again, quite similar but smaller values for Se/ NPV and/or Sp/PPV were found when compared to the results of the original articles. A cut-off value between 1 and 3 could be suggested to maximize the value of Se in [13] and, for the same reason, a cut-off of 3 in [15] . Unfortunately, no comparison could be made with results derived from Nakakubo et al. [16] , because the original article proposed to classify patients in three groups (low, moderate and high risk). The last two groups were collapsed in this study and showed encouraging results for Se and NPV. All these results nuance or even contradict ",

As mentioned above, except for one score, all models presented in this study showed acceptable (> 0.70) or excellent (> 0.80) values for AUROC. The score with the smallest value (0.60) was derived from Aldobyany et al. [15] , the only article that did not use biological parameters or results from radiological examination, highlighting the importance of these parameters. Unfortunately, only a score was given, and no calibration measures could be calculated. The model derived from Tordjman et al. [13] , which was also very simple with only four biological parameters and no radiological exam, showed an AUROC value equal to 0.74 and good and quite similar calibration results when compared to the other most sophisticated models where the result from chest X-ray was used. However, it tended to overestimate high risk. These findings showed that a clinical triage of patients based only on symptoms and/or risk exposure is less efficient than one based on biological parameters and/or radiological examination. This confirms the suggestion cited in [5] about the importance of a combination of qRT-PCR with clinical, radiological or serological in the triage of patients to prevent false-negative results. It also confirms the difficulty to build a diagnostic model that would be simple, effective and based on information immediately available upon hospital arrival or at the triage stage. If anamnestic data are easily and rapidly available, biological analysis are time consuming and even more radiological findings. A balance must be found between the accuracy and the time needed to calculate the prediction that should be faster that qRT-PCR method. The future solution could potentially come from innovative strategies combining point-of-care testing and artificial intelligence-driven models as described recently by Soltan et al. [41] .",

Indeed, ICC varied from to 0.16 to 0.44 while Kappa coefficients from 0.02 to 0.46. Moreover, the limit of agreement in the Bland-Altman analyses was very large. Poor agreement between the cutoff values could be explained by the fact that either the sensitivity values were very good at the expense of the specificity values or vice versa, and thus, the objectives, to maximize Se or Sp, were not the same for all cut-off scores. Another explanation could be the different predictor variables included in the scores and/or models, predictors with various clinical meaning. As mentioned by Gilbert et al. [42] , the multiple predictive scores described currently in the literature present an important heterogeneity of the variables used (clinical, biological, radiological) related either to their recommended timeto-results, the availability of the data or resources in the concerned setting where the score was developed. In accordance, one important point that remains partially unanswered is the generalizability of these scores. It can be noted that the \"best\" value for agreement (ICC and Kappa > 0.5) was observed in two studies that have these two common parameters, LDH and results from chest X-ray, two parameters already recognised as important in the detection of COVID-19 [43] .",

Moreover, the available database embodied a lot of information over two complete waves (from March to June 2020 and from September 2020 to January 2021) of cases in Belgium and allowed us to construct different models and to perform sensitivity analyses. Nevertheless, this study presents also certain important limitations. Indeed, from the original sample (8033), only 1618 (20%) patients were enrolled in the study due to the lack of information concerning the results from qRT-PCR test, biological parameters and radiological information. This information was necessary to calculate scores and/or fit models derived from the selected studies because (1) the result of qRT-PCR test was the outcome and (2) the other variables were predictors present in almost all the score and/or models selected in [10] . Despite this, the number of included patients met the sample size rules-of-thumb that suggests at least 100 events and 100 non-events [46, 47] . Secondly, roughly 60% of missing values were observed for comorbidities and symptoms. This is explained by the fact that, even if ED nurses and physicians were aware of the data collection, they were unfortunately overwhelmed by the number of patients. However, despite this amount of missing data, the results obtained in this study after multiple imputation seemed to be robust when compared to with those observed in the sample. To our knowledge, regarding robustness, similar observation was not mentioned in [9] . Another limitation was the inability to calculate score or to fit model for all articles from our previous systematic review. Indeed, more than 20% information like known exposure, Visual Analog Scale pain, Sequential Organ Failure Assessment or ethnicity required in [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] was not recorded in the database. Moreover, the modelling approach used in [54] could not be reproduced. So, only 6 articles out of 13 (46%) could be selected in this study, 5 presented score and one or more cut-off values, and only 3 presented results from binary regression models. Future external validation studies could address this issue of heterogeneity in model development and predictors by employing a more proactive and prospective approach in data collection. In so doing, more models could be externally validated with sufficient data, hence robust evidence being yielded. Finally, as already mentioned in [10] , the choice of the studies included in the systemic review presents several biases like biases inherent in each selected studies but also specific to the systematic review like the database searched, the limitation of published with peerreviewed studies and, of course, the period of time where this systematic review took place. Indeed, the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to evolve since then with new scientific and medical advances. That's why, as suggested in [10] , carrying out a living systematic review would be optimal.",

Moreover, the values of the different measures calculated, although lower than those of the original articles, were still close and lead to similar conclusions. Despite this fact, poor agreement was found between the different derived scores and cut-off scores. Two scores had an advantage over others such that COVID-19 diagnosis could be calculated from rapid diagnostic as comorbidities or symptoms and/or blood sample. Nevertheless, these two models had the lowest but though acceptable values for discrimination and calibration measures, highlighting the importance of radiological examination to obtain more efficient models, which entails difficulties in specifying an easy-to-use tool to help clinicians to classify patients at risk of COVID-19.",
