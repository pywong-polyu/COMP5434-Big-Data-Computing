VL is a protozoal infection transmitted by sandflies that causes fever and eventually death when left untreated. VL is controlled by indoor residual spraying (IRS) of insecticide and active case detection (ACD). 2 According to the World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines in response to the pandemic, the VL control programme had to suspend all activities, inevitably impacting the progress towards achieving the target of VL elimination on the Indian subcontinent (ISC). 3 In the past decade, the incidence of VL has decreased drastically on the ISC due to the implementation of successful control. The VL control strategy starts with a 5-y 'attack phase' that consists of intense IRS and ACD, followed by an ongoing 'consolidation phase' with less-intense IRS but increased ACD. The details of these interventions and their implementation are described in the WHO guidelines for the control of VL. 2 Elimination of VL as a public health problem is considered to be achieved when the VL incidence remains <1 VL case per 10 000 people per year at a subdistrict level for 3 consecutive years. 2 It is important to estimate the impact of halting control efforts in terms of the timeline towards achieving the VL elimination target and the extent to which the hard-won gains from previous years are lost. Furthermore, decision makers would like to know whether and how these effects can be mitigated with existing tools.",

Transmission is driven by exposure to sandflies, which can pick up infection from symptomatic cases and individuals with post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL), a mostly selflimiting but long-lasting skin condition that occurs in a fraction (2.5%) of individuals treated for VL. In addition, we consider the possibility that asymptomatically infected individuals do (model E1) or do not (model E0) contribute to transmission.",

The simulated control programme starts with a 5-y attack phase in which we assume IRS, which reduces the number of sandflies in the model by 67%, and ACD, which reduces the time to treatment to an average of 45 d. Subsequently, during the consolidation phase, IRS coverage is reduced to 45% but ACD efforts are further increased, leading to an average duration to treatment of 30 d.

During an interruption, we assume that no IRS and ACD take place and that only passive case detection remains, similar to the pre-control scenario (i.e. an average treatment delay of 60 d). We further assume that the interruption does not change the rate at which humans are exposed to sandflies or the risk of developing PKDL and the duration of PKDL. After the interruption we assume that a control program either follows the original planning of interventions (i.e. the 'interruption scenario') or that a mitigation strategy is implemented to counter the effects of the interruption ('mitigation scenario'). Here we let mitigation efforts depend on when the interruption occurs. When the interruption takes place during the attack phase (i.e. the first 5 y of a program), the attack phase is extended by the same duration as that of the interruption. When the interruption occurs during the consolidation phase (i.e. after \u22655 y of control), a temporary attack phase similar in length to the duration of the interruption is initiated after the interruption and before continuing with the consolidation phase. The additional implemented attack phase contains an intense IRS strategy (67% sandfly reduction) and an ACD, leading to a time to treatment of 45 d, similar to the regular attack phase at the start of the interventions as simulated in the counterfactual scenario.",

The target is defined as 1 VL case (detected and undetected) per 10 000 people per year in the modelled population for 3 consecutive years. In previous modelling studies the time of elimination was defined at the first moment of reaching an incidence of <1 VL case per 10 000 people per year, however, in this study we decided to set this target as >3 y of being below the target incidence, the moment when a setting can be considered by the WHO for achieving validation of elimination. In case the elimination target had already been met before the interruption but was lost due to the interruption, we defined the delay as the time between the start of the interruption and the moment when the target was met again after the interruption (i.e. based on the interruption scenario only).

First, there are settings that experience a delay in achieving the target due to the interruption ( Figure 1 , top panel). Second, there are settings in which the target was already achieved before the interruption took place but, due to the interruption, the target is lost again (middle panel). Third, there are settings in which the timing of achieving the target is not affected by the interruption (bottom panel). The time for achieving the target for all 11 pre-control counterfactual scenarios is presented in Supplementary Figures S2 (model E1) and S3 (model E0). In the counterfactual scenario for a setting with a pre-control incidence of 9 VL cases per 10 000 persons per year, the target is achieved approximately 6.5 y after the start of the programme. If the interruption takes place during the attack phase, 3 y after the start of the programme (top panel), a 1-y interruption would lead to a delay of about 3 y and a 2-y interruption to a delay of about 5.5 y.

In this scenario, the timing of achieving the target was not affected (model E1) or slightly delayed by 6 months (model E0, 12 start of control measures to elimination instead of 11.5 y). Both models predict that a mitigation strategy has little impact in these scenarios. Illustrations are presented in Supplementary  Figures S5 and S6 . In Figure 2 we provide an overview of the differences in delay to achieving the target for 176 scenarios (11 pre-control endemicity levels [y-axis] and 16 different stages of the control program at which interruption and mitigation takes place [x-axis]). In all underlying simulations we assume the interruption and mitigation scenarios last 1 y. The differences in years to achieving the target range from 0 to >7 y, where the delay is highest in a setting with a pre-control VL incidence of 10 VL case per 10 000 persons per year and an interruption 4 y into the programme without mitigation (Figure 2A ). In 40% of the settings the interruption leads to a delay or a loss of target with an average delay of 3.5 y. Generally the settings most affected by an interruption are those with high pre-control endemicities and when the interruption occurs between 4 and 9 y into the programme. Typically for settings with lower pre-control incidences, the earlier into the programme the interruption takes place, the greater the impact. In contrast, for settings with higher pre-control incidences, the later into the control programme, the greater the impact. The mitigation strategy reduces the delays to the target by nearly 9 months on average ( Figure 2B ). In previously highly endemic settings (9-12 VL cases per 10 000 persons per year), this increases to an average of 13 months with a maximum of 7 years reduction. In moderately or low-endemic settings, a mitigation strategy provides little additional impact, as the target is estimated to be achieved around the same time with continued regular interventions. The outlier in Figure 2B (and Supplementary Figures S8 and S9) is caused by the mitigation strategy leading to not losing the elimination target, whereas in the interruption scenario it does (Supplementary Figure S21) . Figure 2C shows that in no case could the simulated mitigation strategy lead to achieving the target sooner compared with the counterfactual scenario. Similar simulations with model E0 (in which only VL and PKDL cases are considered infectious) follow an identical pattern (Supplementary Figure S9) . However, in 75% of the settings the interruption is estimated to lead to a delay and the impact occurs over the entire range of pre-control endemicities, but with a lower average delay of 2.5 y. For a setting with a pre-control incidence of 2 VL cases per 10 000 persons per year, the delay is estimated to be as high as 6 y.",

A 1-y interruption of the VL control programme can cause 0-7 y of delay in achieving the VL elimination target compared with without an interruption. In some settings that have already achieved the target before the COVID-19 pandemic, the target can be lost, as VL incidence increases to val-ues above the target. The length of this delay increases with precontrol endemicity, the duration of the interruption and when the interruption happens in the programme. However, more importantly, an increase in VL incidence should be expected in all settings and this increase is, relatively speaking, much greater than the expected delays. Mitigation strategies can, in certain settings, help to reduce the timeline towards the elimination target by as much as about 4.5 y, and more importantly it reduces the number of new VL cases; however, they can never undo all the losses caused by the interruption. Therefore, besides mitigation strategies, it is of great importance to try and keep the duration of the interruption as short as possible to prevent new individuals from becoming infected with VL, thus both positively impacting the health of the population and reducing the delay to the VL elimination target.",

When interpreting the results, it is important to note that currently about 80% of subdistricts in India are in the consolidation phase, mainly 5-10 y into the programme, of which the majority can be classified as previously moderately endemic settings (5-10 VL cases per 10 000 persons per year). When including a 3-month interruption scenario in such a common Indian setting, the impact is predicted to be relatively minor. In our simulations we assume that both the IRS and ACD are implemented successfully during both the attack and consolidation phase. Further, it is important to note that our model predictions pertain to the total VL case incidence, including both detected and undetected cases. We previously showed that an increase in detection delay (be it due to scaling down control or a programme interruption) may result in a decline in reported VL cases, while transmission is already increasing again. 11 Therefore an evaluation of the actual impact of the COVID-19-related interruption of VL control should not only be based on reported VL cases, but also on the distribution of reported detection delays, as this is an indicator of how many cases potentially remain undetected.",

These include the massive population movement at the start of the lockdown, introducing many susceptible individuals from cities into endemic villages and introducing infected individuals into non-endemic villages. The lockdown then led to people staying in and around their homes, which also may have led to changes in the contact rate between humans and sandflies and thus the transmission dynamics. Individual aspects such as increased malnutrition and other comorbidities that impact the course of VL infection and associated infectiousness could also adversely impact the transmission dynamics of VL. Furthermore, we assumed that the care for and followup of detected VL cases (i.e. for detection and treatment of PKDL) would not be affected by the interruption. We previously showed that PKDL is an important driver of transmission after prolonged control. 7 However, PKDL detection is likely to be impaired by COVID-19-related measures, as it relies on house visits by community healthcare workers. Because the duration of PKDL is already quite long (5 y in normal situations) compared with the duration of the interruption considered here (6-24 months), we expect that this assumption has little impact. Most likely, more PKDL cases will be detected and treated after the interruption such that the total average duration will remain approximately the same. We assumed that during the interruption those with symptomatic VL would still seek treatment (through passive case detection), albeit with longer delays. However, if individuals with fever completely abstain from seeking care, our results would be slightly more pessimistic compared with our current outcomes. The Indian governmentled data collection tool KAMIS showed on 31 May 2020 that cases were still being detected (passively) during the months of March-May.",

These factors are especially important in subdistricts with very low incidences as well as settings that border subdistricts with different pre-control endemicities from their own. The latter, however, might be less important when human movement is restricted. Furthermore, on an even smaller geographical scale, such as the village level, the potential effects of an interruption of control measures should be expected to be more variable, ranging from nothing to outbreaks as observed in Kosra. 13 The latter was most likely influenced by the migration of people in and out of the area, a phenomenon that was also observed at the start of the Indian lockdown.",

Even though their impact has been estimated by thoroughly fitting our models to data, 5 their direct impact still requires further investigation using more direct evidence. Given the uncertainty about the impact of COVID-19 on the control programmes, we decided to apply the pessimistic assumption of a complete withdrawal of all ACD and IRS activities. However, if some IRS still takes place, or if healthcare workers are still able to identify some individuals with fever and refer them to the community hospitals for VL diagnosis, the impact of COVID-19-related programme interruption would be less than predicted here.",

Understanding the impact of the lockdown and other associated COVID-19 control measures on delays towards the VL elimination target and increased VL incidence will hopefully increase awareness for the additional health loss suffered by the areas that still experience VL. We wish to highlight that we should not lose focus of the VL elimination targets, that previous gains will to some extent be lost, but that introducing mitigation strategies and restarting the control programme as soon as it is safe possible could reduce (but not counter) the losses, resulting in the continuation of our efforts towards VL elimination as a public health problem on the ISC.",
