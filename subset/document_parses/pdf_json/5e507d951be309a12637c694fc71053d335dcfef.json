SARS-CoV-2 is a pathogen with a particular tropism for respiratory tract epithelial cells leading to respiratory clinical pictures of various degrees of gravity, ranging from mild form characterized by cough, sore throat, and rhinitis to respiratory failure and acute respiratory distress (ARDS), secondary to virus colonization of the most distal region of the bronchial tree [2] . Respiratory symptoms frequently are associated with fever, headache, asthenia, diarrhea, vomiting, anosmia and, ageusia [3] . In severe cases of COVID-19, the viral dissemination into the bloodstream may determine secondary involvement of kidneys, esophagus, bladder, ileum, heart tissues, and central nervous system [4] .",

However, influenza-like symptoms (headache, fatigue, rash, myalgia, dyspnea, rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal pain) often coexist, making difficult to formulate a differential diagnosis [6, 10] . In addition, olfactory and gustatory abnormalities (typical of adult cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection) are rare in pediatric populations [11, 12] . The reasons why children and adolescents with SARS-CoV-2 infection have a milder disease course than adults are not yet clear. It has been suggested that biological factors in children, such as an immature immune system, could play a role to offer protection against damaging effects secondary to viral infection and abnormal immune system activation [13] . Moreover, differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) expression may explain why SARS-CoV-2 infection is milder among children than adults as it represents the main gate for infection. The interaction between the SARS-CoV-2 envelope-anchored spike protein and ACE2 allows the entry of the virus into the type II alveolar cells of the lung. As a protective factor against SARS-CoV-2 infection, children seem to have a different ACE2 configuration, concentration, or binding capacity or a less harmful alveolar epithelial cell response to ACE2 when compared with adults [14] .",

In contrast, in low-income countries where underweight and overweight could coexist, the balance has moved towards undernutrition [47] . Malnutrition increases morbidity and mortality during infections and causes a significant economic impact on the health care systems [47] . Simultaneously, infections increase the need for several nutrients necessary to maintain bodily integrity and to support immune system activity [48] . In fact, it is well-recognized that nutrition has an important role in modulating the immune response. In this regard, Calder et al. have highlighted the importance of optimal nutritional status as a protective factor against viral infections [49] . In applying these considerations to the current COVID-19 pandemic, Wu and colleagues have underlined how a nutritional intervention might reduce damages to the lung of patients affected with SARS-CoV-2 [50] .",

Vitamin A has been studied for its important function in regulating immune function, in both cellular and humoral immune responses [52] . Studies on infants have shown that Vitamin A supplementation leads to increased production of antibodies after vaccines, like measles [52] , anti-rabies vaccination (2.1 times) [53] and influenza virus vaccination, also in children [54] . In order to reduce mortality and risk of complications from pneumonia, croup, and ocular problems it is recommended to correct the low or depleted retinol concentrations resulting from measles infection. This can have some interesting implications considering that severe COVID-19 infection has measles-like manifestations which include fever, cough, and pneumonia but, to date, there is still little evidence to support a beneficial effect of vitamin A supplementation on respiratory infections. However, WHO recommends vitamin A as part of the standard treatment package for all children with acute measles [55] .",

Because of its capacity to reduce excessive activation of the immune response, adequate levels of vitamin C are also proved to increase the survival rate of COVID-19 patients.

Although vitamin D is usually known for its role in the maintenance of bone health and calcium-phosphorus metabolism, many other functions of this hormone have been recently discovered. In fact, Vitamin D can interact both with the innate immune system, by activating Toll-like receptors (TLRs) or increasing the levels of cathelicidins and \u03b2-defensins, and the adaptive immune system, by reducing immunoglobulin and proinflammatory cytokines production, thus modulating T cells function and reducing lung inflammation [61] [62] [63] . Through human cathelicidin peptide LL37, it also exerts a potent antiviral effect on a variety of viruses, such as HIV-1, influenza viruses, HSV1-2, rhinovirus, and HCV [64] [65] [66] [67] . However, it is not known the adequate supplementation regimen to adopt in order to obtain serum levels of vitamin D that guarantee its immunomodulatory role.

Based on these considerations, vitamin E supplementation might be an option to contain long-term damages of COVID-19. However, in view of the few data available to date, this vitamin is not used as a preventive strategy for viral infections.",

Beyond its ability to modulate the immune system, zinc can improve barrier functions enhancing cilia's morphology and increasing its length and beating frequency [79] . Moreover, it promotes antiviral and antioxidants actions that offer protection to the respiratory epithelial lining. For these reasons, an uptake of up to 40 mg per day of zinc is recommended for adults to reduce the potential threat of the COVID-19 pandemic, resulting from the rise in the host resistance to viral infections [80] . Indeed, a study conducted in Thailand among children aged between 2 and 60 months found that acute lower respiratory tract infections solved faster in the ones who received zinc supplementation (median (IQR): 3 (2-4) days and 4 (3) (4) (5) days, respectively; P = 0.008), and that their hospital stay was shorter (mean (SD): 3.8 (1.3) days and 6.1 (3.2) days) than the placebo group [81] . Based on these considerations, it could be assumed that zinc supplementation may be useful also for children.",

According to Gutierrez et al. omega-3 FAs are incorporated into the cell membrane of neutrophils where they can be metabolized into prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, maresins, protectins, and resolvins which then modulate neutrophil migration, phagocytic capacity, as well as the production of reactive oxygen species and cytokines. Moreover, omega-3 FAs improve the function of the macrophages promoting their phagocytic capacity and down-regulate Nuclear Factor-\u03ba Beta (NF\u03baB), which in turn reduces inflammatory markers like IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and tissue growth factorbeta [91] . By reducing the release of proinflammatory mediators through resolvins and other metabolites, EPA and DHA interfere with pulmonary neutrophils recruitment, increase apoptosis by macrophages, and subsequently decrease broncho-alveolar IL-6 production and as a result, turning off the inflammation of the lung and preventing the cytokine storm. Interestingly, omega-3 FAs also exert anti-viral effects by inducing interferon (IFN) which inhibits viral replication [92] . Based on these considerations, the European Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition supports the use of omega-3 FAs to ameliorate complications of COVID-19, although firm evidence is still missing [93] .",

            "text": "In addition to micronutrients, the scientific society has evaluated the potential beneficial effects of several herbals and probiotics in reducing the morbidity and mortality COVID-19 associated [94] . It has been suggested that plants could offer protection against viral infection, through polyphenols, flavonoids and isocyanates such as turmeric, quercetin, resveratrol and, sulforaphane [95, 96] . Based on this evidence, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, Chinese doctors have proposed the employment of these substances to offer protection against the harmful effects of SARS-CoV-2 virus [97] . By exploiting the inhibitor effect in vitro against MERS virus, resveratrol has been studied also for SARS-CoV-2 infection [98] . It is a polyphenolic compound, chemically known as trans-3,5,4\u2032-trihydroxystilbene, that can be found in red grapes, berries, peanuts, and bamboo [99] . Besides its ability to reduce virus replication, the anti-oxidative and anti-inflammatory effect [100] , this polyphenol forms an extremely reliable compound with the human ACE-2 transmitter inhibiting virus interaction with target cells [101] . Furthermore, it is able also to activate SIRT1 and p53 signaling pathways and increase cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and natural killer (NK) immune cells [102] . Although there is no indication to use resveratrol to treat SARS-CoV-2 infection, it may be a beneficial adjunctive antiviral agent to consider. Similar to resveratrol, curcuma (a therapeutic rhizomatous plant of the Zingiberaceae family known as turmeric) can limit the virus's intracellular penetration binding on its surface. Add to this, it reduces the cytokine storm by lowering the NFkB production and, blocking the production of TNF-\u03b1, it stops the fibrotic degeneration of lung, kidneys, cardiac muscle cells and hematopoietic system cells [103] . Its potential antidepressant and anti-anxiety effect should be not underestimated [104] . Quercetin is a flavonoid that is the most abundant in vegetables and fruits [105] . It acts modulating gene expression of 98/332 human genes (30%) codifying for cellular receptor proteins for SARS-CoV-2 virus [106] . Abian et al analyzing a small chemical library of about 150 compounds, identified the quercetin, a potent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro (K i ~ 7 \u03bcM) [107] . 3CLpro is a potent viral protease necessary for SARS-CoV2 replication. Biophysical techniques and binding to the active site in molecular simulations have allowed to know the exact mechanism with which quercetin interacts with 3CLpro, making it a candidate for COVID-19 therapeutic treatment. In this regard, it is underway a randomized, open-labeled, and controlled study aimed to investigate the adjuvant benefits of quercetin phytosomes in community-based subjects with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection (by RT-PCR). The study has two arms: in the first arm, there are subjects receiving standard COVID-19 care per the hospital/physician guidelines, whereas in the other, the subjects are treated with routine COVID-19 care and quercetin phytosomes. It is proposed that quercetin phytosomes, after 30 days of supplementation, will boost the natural immunity of the subjects and help to prevent the COVID-19 disease progression, reducing the need for hospitalization [108] . Finally, sulforaphane, a natural activator of nuclear factor erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the most powerful human antioxidant, has been suggested as preventive strategy for severe COVID-19. In fact, SARS-CoV-2 virus determines ACE2 destruction after being linked to it, resulting in angiotensin II receptor type 1 (AT1-R) activation with consequent oxidative stress, insulin resistance and endothelial lung damage [109] . The first observations derived from the finding of a low mortality in East Asia, central Europe and Balkans, where there is a high consumption of fermented foods and cabbage, rich in sulforaphane [110] . Therefore, his assumption through cabbage and broccoli could offer protection against the severe forms of disease.",

In this regard, the WHO research forum on COVID-19 has recently published in 'New England Journal Medicine' data about the use of repurposed antiviral drugs (remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, lopinavir, and interferon beta-1a) for SARS-CoV-2 infection [128] . The study has been conducted in 11,330 adults hospitalized with COVID-19, by engaging 405 hospitals of 30 countries worldwide. Results obtained have not documented any difference in reducing the duration of hospital stay, the need for assisted ventilation and, mortality by comparing patients treated with trial drugs with those treated with standard of care. In the pediatric population data are even less, not allowing the achievement of a universal therapeutic intervention plan. Currently, treatment in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 consists mainly of supportive care, including oxygen and advanced respiratory support, hydration, and antipyretics. Since a relevant viral load, an immune response uncontrolled and pre-existing clinical conditions are physiopathological factors influencing the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection, both control of viral replication and immunomodulation might help to deal with harmful effects of viral infection. Hence the idea to find alternative approaches for new potential treatment strategies [128] Fig. 1 .",

[130] One of the greater advantages of Internet-based interventions (IMIs) is the possibility to easily include them into the daily activities of the patients. They can help people to overcome the fear of stigmatization by preserving anonymity and allowing individuals to be more aware of their personal progress [131] . Furthermore, Telehealth represents a valid option for treating children with obesity as already confirmed by the decrease in BMI documented by Fleischman et al. after 3 months of primary care provider's visits integrated with telematic assistance [132] .

Therefore, it is possible to define them as functional foods rich in vitamins, mineral salts, fibers, and fatty acids in such quantities as to positively influence body functions. To date, two classes of nutraceuticals have been described: those that contribute to adequate body growth and those that offer protection against infections [141, 142] . Over time, a lot of nutraceuticals have been proposed. However, the link between the intake of a certain substance, such as vitamins, and the prevention of infections is not always demonstrated, so the possibility to use nutraceuticals to prevent infections, especially respiratory infections, remains questioned. This concept becomes even more important considering the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Basic hygienic practices, proper dietary and lifestyle behaviors are necessary to prevent respiratory viral diseases. The meals distribution over the day should provide at least five portions of fruit and vegetables each day and all main meals should contain a balanced proportion of macronutrients to achieve an adequate caloric daily intake [143] .",

Despite the lack of extensive data on the real effectiveness of vaccination against SARS-CoV-2 in children and adolescents, these vaccinations appear to be safe [156, 157] . Therefore, the main scientific societies are in accord to extend the SARS-CoV-2 vaccine administration also to pediatric patients. Until recently all children over 12 years of age have received vaccination with mRNA vaccines (BioNTech/Pfizer or Moderna). On November 25th EMA's human medicines committee (CHMP) has recommended granting an extension of indication for the COVID-19 vaccine Comirnaty to children aged 5 to 11 after evidence declaring the superiority of benefits over risks in this age group. Starting in December 2021, the consensual approval of the Italian Medicines Agency (AIFA) has allowed the extension of vaccination practice to Italian children aged 5-11 years with a lower dose of Comirnaty that used in people aged 12 and above (10 \u03bcg compared with 30 \u03bcg). As in the older age group, it is given as two injections in the muscles of the upper arm, three weeks apart. This is only the first step who will guide towards overcoming the SARS-CoV2 global pandemic.",
