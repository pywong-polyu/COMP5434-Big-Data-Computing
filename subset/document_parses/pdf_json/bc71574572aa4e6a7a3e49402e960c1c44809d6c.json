Trump projects a grandiose and omnipotent self-image during press conferences and rallies, and his followers at these events often respond with both effusive admiration and an inflated sense of their own selfregard, all of which are aspects of narcissism. However, while Trump's personal narcissism has been well documented, there is little research on the narcissism of his supporters. In this study we conducted an exploratory analysis examining the hierarchical structure of pathological narcissism and which aspects of narcissism within that structure were associated with intended voting for Trump in the 2020 U.S. presidential election in a sample of U. S. residents collected online (N = 495) using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Results indicated that an eight-echelon hierarchy best fit the data. Within this hierarchy, antagonistic and indifferent aspects of narcissism within the fifth echelon best predicted intended voting for Trump over and above relevant demographic variables. These results have implications for the study of narcissism and, especially given the results of the 2020 election, the degree to which one can make use of narcissistic aspects of personality in political contests.",

Research suggests that demographic factors influence voting for Trump (e.g., people who are White, male, older, and less educated are more likely to vote for him), but identity politics explains only a portion of people's voting behavior [2, 3] . There is reason to suspect that Trump's narcissism may reflect in some ways the narcissism of those who vote for him. However, there is little research on the association between narcissism and likelihood of voting for Donald Trump.",

In diagnostic and colloquial terms, narcissism is often understood in terms of grandiosity, inflated self-esteem, and feeling entitled and superior to others [5] [6] [7] . However, perhaps a more accurate and clinically a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 informed view is that narcissism is a process. In this process, the grandiosity characteristic of narcissism functions as a defense against feelings of vulnerability, inferiority, and generally not being good enough [5, 6, [8] [9] [10] . Although some have argued that narcissism is a normal aspect of development (e.g., [9] ), it becomes pathological when it causes disruption in the lives of the narcissistic person and/or those around them.",

His statements are often self-centered and show little regard for other people, and he lies effortlessly and without compunction [26, 27] .

For example, Trump and those in his administration have been embroiled in legal disputes since the beginning of his term (which contributed to an unusually high degree of staff turnover), many of his domestic and international policies were unsuccessful, and due to his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, over 400,000 Americans died of the virus over the course of his presidency [26] [27] [28] 30] . Consequently, Trump's approval rating in the U.S. never approached 50% and he was impeached by Congress approximately mid-way through his term and again at the end of his term [31] .",

            "text": "Although most Americans did not approve of Donald Trump and his performance as president, there is a large and vocal minority who very much did and do [32] . To the extent that Trump has a cohesive political platform, it focuses on appealing to people who may identify with and thus voted for him: heterosexual, older White men without a college education (e.g., [3] ). This appeal extends more broadly to regions in which potential supporters may cluster (i.e., states in which the Republican Party predominates). However, more than just identity influences voting [2] . The pathological narcissism that some have attributed to Donald Trump repels many people who are secure in their identity, but it may attract those who may be less secure, who may think of themselves as exceptional but feel undervalued and who thus identify with the grandiose and aggressive aspects of Donald Trump, using this identification to defend against their own vulnerability [13, 32, 33] . In effect, Trump's narcissism may attract the support of those who also have narcissistic tendencies (and, additionally, may reinforce these tendencies). Indeed, at Trump's rallies and other public events, his followers often respond with what might be considered effusive admiration and an inflated sense of their own self-regard, manifesting aspects of both narcissistic grandiosity and vulnerability. It is unclear the degree to which one or both dimensions of narcissism might influence how people actually vote. Research suggests that narcissistic entitlement (an aspect of narcissistic grandiosity) is associated with political conservatism in general [34] . Research further suggests that collective narcissism (the feeling one's in-group is exceptional, which is linked to narcissistic vulnerability) is associated with voting for Trump for president in 2016 in particular [32] as well as with holding a positive opinion of him post-election [35] . However, there is little research examining what aspects of pathological narcissism might have predicted voting for Trump for re-election in 2020.",

First, we required survey respondents to complete a Captcha to ensure they were not bots. Second, we automatically directed survey respondents out of the survey without compensation if they provided incorrect answers on any of three items (\"Which of the following is cold?\", \"Which of the following would a person wear on their head?\", and \"5 + 1 =\"). Third, of those respondents who made it to the end of the survey, we deleted responses from those who did not respond to 10% or more of survey items (n = 197). Finally, we removed from analysis those who scored at or above 84T on the Infrequency scale of the Personality Assessment Inventory [37], a scale designed to detect random or unusual responding (n = 87). This yielded a final sample of 495 people, who took on average 15.56 minutes (933.88 seconds, SD = 1087.68, range: 85-19,394) to complete the survey.",

Just prior to the survey, there were 7.53 million confirmed cases of and over 211,000 deaths from COVID-19. Donald Trump himself contracted COVID-19 and returned from the hospital against medical advice, after which he made a speech in which he stated that this disease was not a major concern, and later stated that he would reject a COVID-related economic stimulus package. Following this, there was a 600-point swing (down 1.3%) in the Dow-Jones Index (down 1.4% in S&P, 1.6% in Nasdaq) [45] . Twenty-three members of Trump's White House staff and others in his orbit also tested positive for COVID-19 [46] .

Specifically, we entered 29 different subscales of narcissism into a principal components analysis (orthogonal Varimax rotation), extracting one component, then two, then three, and so on until no subscale had its highest loading on a new factor. Following this, we correlated each factor solution with the one above and below it to construct a structural hierarchy in which factors within each echelon were uncorrelated with each other but selectively correlated with factors at echelons above and below it. This approach is useful in that it provides information about how factor structural unfolds. An additional benefit is that the factors within each structure can serve as predictors in regression models with no concerns about multicollinearity since they were uncorrelated with each other.",

In contrast to conventional approaches to data analysis, which evaluate observed effects with respect to a null hypothesis (expressed results in terms of p-values), Bayesian approaches to data analysis evaluate the relative probability of a range of possible effect estimates. Specifically, Bayesian models generate potential effect estimates via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation and then compare these estimates with the data to establish their relative probability (for review see [51, 52] ). Bayesian data analyses produce more accurate and informative estimates of effects than conventional data analyses [53] and because of this are increasingly used in psychological research [54] (for historical review see [55] ). In this study we estimated each model using a low-information (flat) prior, thus allowing the data to have maximum influence on the results. Each model consisted of 3 chains of 20,000 iterations of Hamiltonian MCMC (HMC) simulation (and a burn-in period of 5,000 iterations), which we estimated using the rstanarm package in R [56] . We evaluated whether or not each chain of HMC simulation converged using Monte Carlo Standard Error and Potential Scale Reduction Factor diagnostics and through manual examination of autocorrelation and traceplots. All models terminated normally with no indication of non-convergence. We evaluated relative probability of models using the Leave-One-Out (LOO) cross-validation method, which compares two or more Bayesian models in terms of their relative probability in terms of the expected log pointwise predictive density (ELPD) statistic (for review see [57] ). We conducted model LOO comparisons via the loo package in R [58] .",

An overall factor of pathological narcissism was at the top of the hierarchy, which split into grandiosity and vulnerability in the second echelon. In the third echelon, vulnerability split to form a more specific vulnerability factor and an unempathic distrust factor. In the fourth, grandiosity split into a more specific grandiosity factor and a self-centered antagonism factor, to which distrust also contributed. In the fifth, a factor resembling indifference to other people emerged from grandiosity and distrust. In the sixth, a psychopathic boldness factor emerged from grandiosity and indifference. In the seventh, grandiosity split into an even more specific grandiosity factor and an attentionseeking factor, the latter of which split in the eighth echelon into a more specific attentionseeking factor and uniqueness factor. We next entered factor scores from each echelon of the hierarchy into a series of binomial regression models predicting intended vote Trump in 2020. Since factors were uncorrelated at each echelon of the hierarchy, there was minimal multicollinearity in any of the regression models (across predictors in all models, VIF \ufffd 1.32). Analysis of ELPD suggested that the model with fifth-echelon predictors was the most probable, although all models with narcissism were more likely than the model only demographic variables (\u0394ELPD \ufffd 4.3). In this model, having a Bachelor's degree or higher made people half as likely to vote for Trump, while being a member of the Republican Party made people over 48 times more likely to vote for Trump. Including narcissism as predictors accounted for a modest amount of additional variance (\u0394R 2 = .03), with higher levels of antagonism and indifference predicting a greater likelihood of intended voting for Trump (see Table 2 ; results of all models included in S1 File).",

We found that self-centered antagonism and indifference to other people predicted intended vote for Trump over and above salient demographic variables. These findings inform how we might think about the link between personality and voting, and have implications for future research. Study findings suggest that aggression and indifference are the aspects of narcissism most associated with intending to vote for Donald Trump in 2020 rather than more vulnerable aspects of narcissism. This is consistent with Trump's aggressive stance during his presidency and (re)election campaigns [27, 29] rather than one that is more consoling towards his supporters and any vulnerability they might feel. It is feasible that vulnerable aspects of narcissism (and/or other aspects of personality) may have predicted voting for Trump in 2016 (e.g., that those who voted for him in 2016 did so out of vulnerability and frustration; see [32]), and that this changed in the 2020 election cycle. However, these findings cannot speak to this directly. Given the chronological variability of pathological aspects of personality vis-\u00e0-vis normal personality traits (for review see [59] ), an extension of this research could involve a longitudinal investigation of how aspects of pathological narcissism differentially predict likelihood of voting (or a proxy of this, such as level of approval) over time.",

By all accounts, Donald Trump ran his 2020 reelection campaign and his presidency more broadly based on the dimensions of narcissism highlighted in this study: antagonism and indifference seem to have been guiding principles, both implicitly and explicitly [27] [28] [29] . While touching on emotional (and at times darker) aspects of human nature has long been a feature in politicking, especially among the modern-day Republican Party [60] , we might reflect on the results of the 2020 presidential election in considering how effective it is to rely on this entirely. That Trump definitively lost both the popular vote (with his opponent Joe Biden winning more votes than any other candidate in American history [61] ) as well as the electoral college (which generally favors Republican-leaning states) suggest that doing so may not be that effective: a platform rooted in animosity towards others can generate a substantial amount of angry enthusiasm (as was clear during the election and its immediate aftermath), but may not be one that is convincing to the majority of people, at least not in a country as diverse as the U.S.",

            "text": "In a different vein, findings generally support the results of previous studies on the hierarchical structure of narcissism [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . General narcissism split into grandiose and vulnerable dimensions, and later into dimensions such as antagonism, boldness, and distrust, although some of these factors emerged at different levels of the structural hierarchy than in previous studies. This likely reflects not only a different sample, but also a different selection of narcissism scales than in others studies. However, all scales included in this and previous research on the structure of narcissism included only those measuring personal narcissism. This is in contrast to collective narcissism, which has been prominent in research on political psychology but not clinical/personality psychology (for review see [32] ). Future research on the structure (and, if relevant, predictive validity) of narcissism might thus include a broader measurement of narcissism. The limitations of this study suggest further avenues of future study. Perhaps foremost among these is the outcome variable: in this study we measured intended voting for Donald Trump rather than actual voting, which may be problematic in many ways. For example, some study participants who actually intended to vote for Trump may have been reticent to state this in an online survey for fear that the information might become public and they would subsequently be judged by others (a phenomenon similar to the \"shy\" Trump voter in 2016 who despite their intended and eventual vote for Trump denied this when polled for fear of being judged [62] ). It is also possible that participants' voting intentions changed from the time of data collection to when they cast their votes. Although measuring actual voting is not feasible in the U.S. for ethical reasons, the next-best proxy for this may be exit polls, which tend to correlate highly with election outcomes, although they are also not without problems (for review see [63] ). Another useful approach would be to measure intended voting less in terms of categories (e.g., Trump vs. someone else) than in terms like dimensional likelihood of voting for Trump (e.g., very unlikely, somewhat unlikely, somewhat likely, very likely). This approach might have yielded a different and more precise depiction of voters' voting intensions. In addition, although the sample of this study was representative of the U.S. based on state residence in that residents of most states contributed to the study, it was not as representative of the voting behavior of the nation as a whole. Specifically, participants in this study reported intending to vote for Trump much less (and to a lesser extent, for Biden more) than was reflected in the actual election results. This may be in part due to the tendency of Mturk workers to be better educated than the U.S. population as a whole [64] , which in turn was negatively associated with voting for Trump. This study also did not include a measure of socio-economic status, which also has a salient influence on voting behavior (for review see [65] ). Future approaches to measuring the influence of narcissism and other aspects of personality on voting studies should thus use a proxy of voting more directly reflecting actual voting and recruiting a sample more representative of the population of interest.",
