For a full description of these Evidence-Based Medicine ratings, please refer to the There are an estimated 46,300 plastic surgeons worldwide [1] . More than one-third of all physicians are 65 or older [2] . At this very moment, there may be 15,000 retired plastic surgeons around the world. Our life's work and our identity as plastic surgeons deeply motivates our desire to help during this worldwide pandemic, yet we recognize that we are now considered a high-risk population [3] [4] [5] [6] . It is during this time of wanting to contribute that inspired me to share this perspective [3] [4] [5] [6] .",
