For example, a 2017 study in Vermont found that 51% of death certificates had a major error that impacted the interpretation of the primary cause or contributing causes of death [20] . In a 2010 study, deaths from cardiovascular disease in New York City were overestimated by 51% in adults ages 35-74 [21] . These errors have significant impacts on the public health data that underlie disease specific mortality rates, track health disparities and inform research and policy priorities. For example, in a study by Yin et al, misclassification of colon and rectal cancer deaths on the death certificate led to an inflation of the 5-year cause-specific survival rate for rectal cancer from 64.9% to 81.2% [22] . Despite ample evidence of errors in death certificates in the United States [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , and evidence that these errors are increasing in frequency [23] , it is not clear what is causing these errors or how to prevent them. This study aims to better understand the challenges faced by providers when they complete the cause of death section of death certificates, how those challenges might contribute to sources of error, and any specific challenges relating to cancerrelated deaths.",

Focus groups were chosen for this study to replicate the discussions that may occur between providers when faced with challenges in death certification, and to investigate the degree of consensus between providers on the challenges involved in determining the cause of death. After the fourth focus group, thematic saturation was reached, a finding in line with Guest et. al who found that 80% of themes are captured in 2-3 focus groups and 90% are captured in 3-6 focus groups [24] . Purposive sampling [25] was used to recruit providers from a variety of specialties, levels of training and type of practice, using group email invitations. The study was conducted at a single academic institution in rural New England. A moderator (AM) oversaw each group and two additional researchers (SG and VL) took notes on participant tone and body language. The moderator was a medical student with training in qualitative research methods. Her role was to provide the group with standardized discussion questions and ask follow-up questions on new ideas presented, while managing the time and ensuring all focus group members had the chance to speak. Group bias was minimized by creating groups where providers did not know one another and by masking the provider type to avoid the potential of presumed hierarchy influencing provider responses. The 60-90 minute groups were conducted in private hospital conference rooms with participants seated at a single table to facilitate discussion. The focus groups were recorded with an audio recording device and then transcribed verbatim for analysis by the study team. The COREQ checklist was followed to present the study findings [26] .",

An additional topic that was discussed in a smaller number of focus groups was the impact of the next of kin on the information included in the death certificate. Although providers did not report changing the death certificate based on family wishes, they did note the challenging circumstances that arose when factors such as life insurance, military exposures to carcinogenic agents and disease stigma were raised during the death certification process because of perceived financial or personal implications for the next of kin.",

Electronic death certification is used in several states already and was seen by many providers as a way to build instantaneous feedback into the process. Some providers described electronic systems in other states that would reject invalid diagnoses, such as mechanisms of death, and would catch errors such as fields left blank or information entered in the wrong area. Providers working in the inpatient setting described the benefit of a hospital death coordinator for proving feedback and ongoing training. Death coordinators use their expertise in certification to screen for errors and provide real-time feedback and training to staff when they encounter challenges. ",

Some providers believed that if a patient died from an aggressive cancer, the cancer should be listed as the immediate cause of death. Other providers had been taught that cancer should not be listed as the immediate cause of death. The second challenge was fitting the complexities of the diagnosis or patient history into the death certificate in a meaningful way. Many providers described patients with long histories of cancer with periods of remission and multiple recurrences which did not fit easily into the confines of the death certificate. The third challenge reported by providers was the heightened documentation requirements that some providers perceived exist for cancer. Many felt that exact tissue diagnosis, location of the primary tumor and sequence of metastatic spread should be included in the death certificate. Some oncologists and palliative care providers also included pathology information and a list of remissions and recurrences when applicable. This degree of detail was challenging for many of the hospitalist and community providers that did not have extensive records of patients' cancer history. Five providers reported receiving queries from the state cancer registry regarding death certificates listing cancer as a cause of death.

In addition, several participants reported that, when unable to make a definitive diagnosis, they would list mechanisms of death such as cardiac or respiratory arrest; however, these mechanisms simply attest to the fact of death and they do not describe its etiology. If used at all, mechanisms of death must always be accompanied by cause of death: \"the disease, abnormality, injury, or poisoning that caused the death\" [27] . When the cause of death was not definitively diagnosed, it is acceptable to list it as \"probable\" or \"likely\".

For example, one participant mentioned being asked to follow an algorithm for unwitnessed or sudden events that would attribute deaths to cardiovascular disease in all males over age 50 and to females over age 60 with a history of hypertension. In a concerning form of circular logic, this approach is likely to perpetuate and amplify inaccuracies in the data, exaggerating the importance of one cause of death over others and potentially obscuring important trends. This finding is supported by several studies that have demonstrated that death certificates substantially overestimate cardiovascular mortality [21, 29, 30] .

In the hypothetical and intentionally vague case study, participants took varied approaches when the role of cancer was uncertain and the death was unwitnessed. Some participants described cancer as the immediate cause of death while others described it as the underlying cause of death and several participants omitted it completely. One focus group discussion centered around the idea that people don't die of cancer, but of something else (e.g. anorexia-cachexia, infection) with cancer as a contributing factor. However, when cancer causes death through such a process, it should be listed as a proximate cause of death and not a contributing cause [27] . Many participants believed that in order to include cancer on the death certificate, a tissue biopsy was necessary. Ideally, a death certificate that indicates neoplasm as a cause of death should include the primary site, behavior (benign/malignant), cell type, grade, and the part or lobe of organ affected [27] . But again, a \"probable\" or \"likely\" diagnosis is also acceptable when such data are not available. Our results also highlighted variability in distinguishing deaths \"from cancer\" and deaths \"with cancer\" and raise concerns about the reliability of national cancer mortality statistics [18, 22, 31] .",

            "text": "A 2005 focus group study by McAllum et al. examined the completion of death certificates by general practitioners in New Zealand [32] . Consistent with our findings, they demonstrated that clinical uncertainty posed a significant challenge for providers in the completion of death certificates. Specific challenges were related to gaps in care and sudden deaths, and there was a tendency to fall back on a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease or myocardial infarction as the cause of death when faced with clinical uncertainty. A second theme was the important role of the deceased's family in determining the cause of death; this was a less prominent issue in our study although some providers described anger from family members over the certification of stigmatizing conditions such as alcoholism. McAllum et al. reported the same circular logic seen in our study whereby providers who do not know the true cause of death may assign one based on their expectations according to patient characteristics such as age, gender, and ethnic group. Uncertainty is likely when physicians are asked to certify deaths of patients they have not treated, or if the patient has not recently sought medical attention. In recent decades, and particularly since the Joint Commission removed the requirement of a 20% autopsy rate by hospitals, there has been a dramatic decline in autopsy rates to only 8.5% in 2007 [33] . \"Gold standard\" data from autopsies would help stop this cycle of uncertainty and allow death certificates to more accurately reflect important trends in population mortality [14, 34, 35] .",

The Centers for Disease Control [27] , World Health Organization [38] , and others have established educational materials on death certificates that can be used to build a structured training program for all providers that are eligible to complete death certificates.

Unlike paper forms, electronic systems can be structured to provide real-time feedback, for example by rejecting mechanism of death such as cardiac arrest, and by offering \"help\" menus to assist in areas of doubt [2] . Feedback is particularly important during public health crises such as the opioid epidemic and Covid-19 pandemic to ensure that deaths are certified using consistent methods, and that timely, accurate data are made available for public health officials and policy makers to monitor the crisis and its management. However, electronic certification systems cannot be expected to overcome errors relating to poor training and uncertainty over causes of death, and the use of dropdown menus and restrictions within the software may even introduce new errors and biases. Variation in software and in the time at which states and territories have adopted electronic certification technology [41] may also impair the interpretation of trends in causes of death. These limitations must be studied within and between states that use different EDRS software to quantify the impacts of \"old\" and \"new\" biases on misclassification of causes of death, but without autopsy confirmation this task may be difficult.",

Limitations of the study included its focus on two health systems in New England, potentially limiting the generalizability of these findings to other U.S. settings. The relatively small size of some of the focus groups and greater proportions of hospital-based participants may have limited the extent of novel ideas and quality of group discussion, and the use of focus groups rather than semistructured interviews may have introduced group biases.",

Immediate feedback via prompts within the software would promote the collection of more accurate data on specific diseases such as cancer and heart disease, including whether these diseases caused, contributed to, or were not relevant to the death. (2) Train all physicians and associate providers in the completion of death certificates both before graduation and as part of continuing education. (3) Change sudden death classification to include a place to record whether the death was witnessed or unwitnessed to provide information relating to certainty of the diagnosis. (4) Reinstate autopsy requirements in order to validate causes of death when diagnoses are uncertain in order to improve confidence in mortality statistics.",
