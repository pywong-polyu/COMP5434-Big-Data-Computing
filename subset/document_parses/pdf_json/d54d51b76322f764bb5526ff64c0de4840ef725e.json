Antibody titres increased significantly over time resulting in strong neutralization titres two weeks after the BNT162b2 boost and subsequently slightly decreased over the course of 17 weeks. At the latest time point measured, all analysed sera retained neutralizing activity against the currently dominant Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. Two weeks post boost, neutralizing activity against the Alpha (B.1.1.7) and immuneevading Beta (B.1.351) variant was \u00bb4-fold higher than in individuals receiving homologous BNT162b2 vaccination. No difference was observed in neutralization of Kappa (B.1.617.1). In addition, heterologous vaccination induced CD4 + and CD8 + T cells reactive to SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides of all analysed variants; Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha, Beta, Gamma (P.1), and Delta.",

The Alpha, Beta, Delta, and Kappa variants of spike are potently neutralized by sera from all participants and reactive T cells recognize spike peptides of all tested variants. These results suggest that this heterologous vaccination regimen is at least as immunogenic and protective as homologous vaccinations and also offers protection against current variants of concern.",

To date, vaccination is considered the key strategy for ending the pandemic. 3 Approved vaccines among others include the adenovirus-based ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (Vaxzevria, AstraZeneca) and mRNA-based BNT162b2 (Comirnaty, BioNTech/ Pfizer), which induce humoral and cellular immunological responses 4\u00c07 (and preprint: 8 ), showed high efficacy in clinical trials, 9, 10 and potent protection from COVID-19 in real-world settings. 11, 12 However, the occurrence of rare thrombotic events with thrombocytopenia after ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccinations, especially in individuals younger than 60 years, associated with the generation of auto-platelet factor 4 antibodies, halted vaccination of this group with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 in some countries. 13\u00c015 As a consequence, several public health agencies recommended boost vaccinations of individuals already primed with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 to be carried out in a heterologous regimen with an mRNA vaccine. 16 In some countries, however, such a regimen is still not applied due to limited data on safety and immunogenicity. Moreover, it remains unclear whether a heterologous boosting schedule is associated with similar 17\u00c019 or greater 20 reactogenicity compared to homologous vaccination. Finally, while robust immune responses are elicited by heterologous vaccination regimens with a 8-12 week interval, 17\u00c019,21 there is limited knowledge about humoral and cellular protection against the variants of concern (VOCs), especially the most prevalent Delta (B.1.617.2) variant. 19 ,21\u00c023 Further, published studies have not investigated how immunity develops several months after vaccination. Here, we examined a cohort of 26 individuals (16 female, 10 male; median age 30.5, range who received ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime and, due to changing recommendations in Germany, 16 a BNT162b2 boost vaccination with a 56-60 day interval and evaluated solicited adverse reactions, humoral and cellular immune responses against several spike variants, including that",

Importantly, heterologous vaccination resulted in high levels of IgG, IgA, IgG/M, and potent neutralizing antibody titres. Sera obtained after full vaccination neutralized Alpha, Beta and Kappa SARS-CoV-2 spike variants with greater potency than after homologous BNT162b2 vaccination. In addition, neutralizing titres against Delta were detected in all participants 3 months after the boost vaccination. SARS-CoV-2 spikereactive CD4 + and CD8 + T cells were regularly elicited by this vaccination regimen, and also responded to Alpha, Beta, Gamma and Delta variants. In conclusion, we provide evidence that in young adults, vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 and BNT162b2 in a heterologous prime-boost regimen is well-tolerated and induces potent Delta neutralizing antibody responses still detectable after 3 months as well as T cell reactivity also against variants.",

Participants were eligible for recruitment if they had not been previously vaccinated against SARS-CoV-2 and were scheduled for a ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 prime vaccination. Prior SARS-CoV-2 infection was determined by medical history and measuring anti-SARS-CoV-2-nucleocapsid antibody levels. One convalescent individual was detected and excluded from all statistical analyses (Table 1) .

Multivariable analyses did not indicate sex or age as an important confounder for this effect (p > 0.05). Of Additionally, we evaluated the neutralizing activities of sera obtained 2 weeks post full vaccination against the immune evading variants Beta (B.1.351) and Kappa (B.1.617.1). Pseudovirus entry driven by Beta spike was neutralized with 2-fold lower potency (p < 0.021; Mann-Whitney-U test) compared to Alpha spike.

Sera of individuals receiving two BNT162b2 immunizations showed lower neutralizing titres against all spike variants tested (Figurere 2f), suggesting stronger humoral protection after the heterologous vaccination also against VOCs.

We found that all sera neutralized the Delta variant, however, with lower titres than previously determined against Alpha and decreasing efficiency from 5-7 to 13-17 weeks post boost (Figurere 2g). Again, these titres correlated well with the IgM/IgG concentrations (Figurere 2c; Figure S2b ).

Cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 spike-spanning peptidepools and analysed for intracellular cytokines TNFa, IFNg, and IL-2 to determine spike-specific CD4 + and CD8 + T cell responses (Figurere 3, S5, S6 ). 6-11 days after boost, 68% of participants showed IFNy, TNFa, and/or IL-2 CD4 + T cell responses upon stimulation with Wuhan-Hu-1 SARS-CoV-2 spike peptides (Figurere 3a). After full vaccination, CD4 + T cells producing IFNg (median 0.055%, range 0.018-0.168), IL-2 (median 0.055%, range 0-0.134) or TNFa (median 0.057%; range 0.01 \u00c0 0.193) were significantly increased upon stimulation as compared to the pre-vaccination baseline (p < 0.05; mixed linear regression model). Spike-reactive CD4 + T cells were detected in 95% suggesting that most individuals developed a robust spike-specific T helper 1 (TH1) CD4 + T cell response post BNT162b2 boost. In addition, we observed an increase of spike-specific CD8 + T cells predominantly producing IFNg (median 0.092%, range 0 -0.665) and TNFa (median 0.055%, range 0 \u00c0 0.375) compared to pre-vaccination baseline samples in all previously uninfected participants (Figurere 3a; p < 0.001; mixed linear regression model). Levels of spike-specific CD8 + T cells producing IL-2 (median 0.01%, range 0-0.052) were lower, which is in agreement with responses reported after homologous BNT162b2 vaccination described in a preprint. 8 We then compared the response to SARS-CoV-2 spike variants Alpha, Beta, and Gamma (P.1) at day 6-11 after boost, and found that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells showed IFNg responses to all spike variants (Figurere 3b), however less pronounced for TNFa and IL-2 ( Figure S6 c,d) . Upon emergence and rapid spread of SARS-CoV-2 Delta, we analysed the reactivity of T cells obtained day 14-19 post boost against this VOC. 94% of participants showed increased responses of CD4 + T cells upon stimulation with Delta spike peptides and all participants had Delta spike specific CD8 + T cells (Figurere 3c) . Thus, T cell reactivity against all five spike variants was found in all participants. Of note, reactivity of the CD4 + and CD8 + T cells of the convalescent individual did not increase after vaccination (Figurere 3a), indicating pre-existing cellular immunity. In conclusion, these findings show a robust humoral and cellular immune response after heterologous vaccination.",

Accordingly, in Germany heterologous vaccinations were typically performed after 12 weeks. Existing vector immunity, however, is irrelevant in the context of a mRNA boost vaccination, on which basis our cohort received the boost after 8 weeks. This heterologous ChAdOx1 nCoV-19/BNT162b2 vaccination elicited strong IgM/G and IgA responses, potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses in all previously uninfected participants, while solicited adverse reactions to vaccination were as expected for a prime ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccination and reduced following heterologous BNT162b2 boost.",

Even though our statistical analyses do not identify possible confounders, this outcome might also depend on sex, age or the vaccination intervals between the two groups as the homologous BNT162b2 cohort was \u00bb10 years older in age, had higher fraction of male participants and was vaccinated in a three-week interval (Table 1; Appendix Table 1 ). Yet, this observation is in agreement with other studies 19, 21, 44 and suggests that ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 / BNT162b2 prime-boost vaccination elicits particularly potent immune responses. 17, 18, 45 As reported for homologous vaccinations, 46 titres also decrease over time after heterologous vaccination. However, they remained high for three months post boost suggesting robust durable protection. Notably, the results might also be influenced by the young cohort age. Circumvention of vector immunity might also contribute to this high immunogenicity. 35 The BNT162b2 encoded spike sequence contains a two-proline mutation not present in ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, which stabilizes the spike protein in a pre-fusion confirmation. 10, 47 It is tempting to speculate that altered spike conformations between the vaccinations might improve humoral responses.",

Neutralization of emerging Kappa, reported to be the most efficient neutralization-evading strain of the B.1.617 lineage, 44 was not reduced compared to Alpha. Previous studies addressing heterologous vaccinations indicated that the Delta variant is equally sensitive to neutralization as Alpha. 22, 23, 45 We observed that in correlation with the IgM/IgG titres, neutralizing titres against Delta are decreasing over the course of 13-17 weeks but remain detectable in all analysed sera at the latest time points. This confirms a good prediction by IgM/IgG titres and indicates durable protection from the most prevalent Delta variant. Breakthrough infections of vaccinated individuals are associated with low neutralizing titres, 50 and a decline of the titre over time results in less effective SARS-CoV-2 neutralization. 46, 51 Thus, the fact that neutralizing titres after heterologous boost are high suggests efficient initial protection from breakthrough infections, also by the Delta variant. Ongoing and future studies addressing the decay kinetics will allow to determine the time after which a second boost might be most beneficial.",

Similarly, responses against Alpha and most humoral immunity-evading VOCs Beta and Gamma were detectable suggesting a broad immune response.

In this case, the observed neutralizing titres 2 weeks after prime were as high as the median titre of those receiving the homologous BNT162b2 vaccination. However, titres (IgM/G) further increased 8-fold after boost, suggesting that prime-boost might provide more potent and longer lasting protection also in convalescent patients. This agrees with a recent study 56 and seems important considering that the currently dominating Delta variant is causing breakthrough infections. 50 In conclusion, a heterologous vaccination regimen of ChAdOx1 nCov-19 prime, followed by BNT162b2 boost after 8 weeks for participants with a median age of 30.5 years was tolerable and effective. These results are encouraging and of significant interest for policy makers, physicians as well as individuals who have received or will receive this combination. This regimen provides flexibility for future vaccination strategies and will be useful for vaccine schedules during shortages. The perspective that heterologous vaccination induces neutralizing titres predictive of protection should be considered as a potential strategy to elicit particularly strong immune responses, e.g. in immunocompromised, highly exposed individuals, against Delta and upcoming VOCs, and for third doses of vaccination after previous homologous prime-boost regimen or vaccine updates against COVID-19. It will be interesting to clarify whether different spike conformations or of different variants are particularly effective. Similarly, whether other vector-or mRNA-based vaccine combinations or those based on other technologies are as effective needs to be addressed in future studies.",

Self-reported adverse reactions can be subject to recall bias and indicated grades of severity are subject to personal and individual sensation. With a median age of 30.5 (range 25 -46) years, the results do not provide information on the elderly. However, our study offers insight into how the younger age group reacts to a heterologous vaccination regimen. This is of high significance, because individuals younger than 60 have regularly been primed with ChAdOx1 nCov-19 and are now offered heterologous boost vaccination. Our study group received the second vaccination after 8 weeks, which is within the range of recommendation of 4-12 weeks for homologous ChA-dOx1 nCov-19 vaccination. Humoral responses determined 15-17 after boost suggest ongoing protection but do not allow conclusions about longer-lasting immunity.",

Stimulation of PBMCs for detection of cytokine production by T cells was adapted from Kasturi et al., 2020. 30 Briefly, 1 \u00a3 10 6 PBMCs were cultured in 200 ml final volume in 96-well U bottom plate in the presence of anti-CD28 (1 mg/ml) and anti-CD49d (1 mg/ ml) (Biolegend) under the following conditions: a) negative control with DMSO, b) SARS-CoV-2 spike peptide pools (1-315 peptides from Wuhan-Hu-1, Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2)SARS-CoV-2 spike, JPT Germany) at a final concentration of 2 mg/ml, c) PMA/ionomycin, d) CEFX Ultra Super Stim peptide pool (176 peptide epitopes for a broad range of HLA subtypes and different infectious agents, JPT Germany) at a final concentration of 2 mg/ ml. Cells were cultured for 2 hours before adding Brefeldin A at 10 mg/ml (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO) for an additional 5 hours. Cells were then washed with PBS, and stained for dead cells (Live/ Dead Fixable; Aqua from Thermo Fisher) in PBS at room temperature for 10 minutes. Without washing, cells were incubated with surface antibody cocktail (prepared in 1:1 of FACS buffer and brilliant staining buffer) for 30 minutes at room temperature with BV510-anti-human CD14 Next, cells were fixed using Cytofix/Cytoperm buffer (BD Biosciences, CA) for 20 minutes at room temperature, and then kept in FACS buffer at 4\u00b0C overnight. 1x Perm/Wash (BD Biosciences, CA) was used for cells permeabilization for 10 minutes at room temperature and followed by intracellular staining for 30 minutes at room temperature with AF647 anti-human IFNg (clone 4S.B3) and AF488 anti-human IL-2 (clone MQ1-17H12) from Biolegend, and PE/Cy7 anti-human TNFa (clone Mab11) from Thermo Fisher Scientific. Up to 100,000 live CD3 + T cells were acquired on a LSRFortessa flow cytometer (BD Biosciences), equipped with FACS Diva software. Analysis of the acquired data was performed using FlowJo software (version 10.7.1). The background from each participant was removed by subtracting the % of spike + cells to the % of DMSO + cells.The SARS-CoV-2 convalescent individual was excluded in all statistical analyses. Data of participants that dropped out were excluded from evaluation. Nonparametric Spearman rank correlation was used to check for possible associations at single blood sample measurements. A paired t-test was used to compare the adverse event scores calculated for each participant after both vaccinations. For this, the individual mean differences were checked for normal distribution by means of QQ-plots and histograms. A comparison of participants receiving heterologous vaccination with controls who received homologous BNT162b2 vaccinations after the last blood sample measurements was done by the Mann-Whitney-U test because of skewed distributions for neutralization scores as well as IgM/IgG measurements. Longitudinal antibody and T cell measurements were analysed by means of a mixed linear regression model including a random intercept in order to account for the repeated measures structure of the underlying data. The mixed linear model approach enabled to simultaneously account for possible confounding due to participants' sex and for the presence of missing data.31 Therefore, no formal imputation of missing interim values was required. A two-sided alpha error of 5% was applied to analyses.",
