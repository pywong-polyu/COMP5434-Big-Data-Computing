It is therefore likely that some plants, widespread in the tradition of many cuisines and which are still eaten every day, originally introduced because of their curative properties, then-over time-might have become staple foods in the local cuisines. For example, many species of the Allium genus, as well as many species with a bitter taste (e.g., Cichorium intybus), show excellent curative properties, with their use being testified in many civilizations since ancient times (the Ebers papyrus, an Egyptian medical text dated 1550 B.C., includes long descriptive sections about the medicinal use of these plant species).",

This process is gradually helping to fill a methodology gap in the relationships between diet and use of wild plants as food [26] . For example, in the Mediterranean diet [27, 28] , according to the definition by the American epidemiologist/biologist Ancel Keys [29] , a fundamental component comes from plant foods, including those spontaneously available in nature. Salutogenesis, a term coined by [30] , is a subject whose aim is to foster the development of health through a process of discovery and use of individual health sources, also at environmental level. The Mediterranean diet is a nutritional model inspired by food models widespread in several countries of the Mediterranean area, founded on the habitual consumption of specific foodstuffs including mainly cereals, fruit, vegetables, grains, olive oil, rather than red meat and animal fats (saturated fats), with a lower percentage of fish, white meat (poultry), legumes, eggs, dairy products, red wine, and sweets. In 2010 UNESCO acknowledged it as a protected asset and added it to the list of oral and immaterial world heritage.",

The increased knowledge of WEPs could have a useful impact on cultivation in marginal areas with a low use of energy inputs, which would have a positive impact on several levels, including the complexity of agroecosystems, increasing their biodiversity. There is also a very close link between WEPs and the cereals, fruits and vegetables that are part of our diet. This link is represented by CWR (crop wild relatives) the wild ancestors of cultivated plants which are recognized as having a strategic role for the conservation and sustainable use of plant resources in agriculture [32] also within the future scenario of climate change [33] [34] [35] .

With an innovative editing structure and rigorous scientific method, the publication \"alimurgia\" was mainly focused on agriculture, ranging from the knowledge of the climate in the Tuscan region, to the choice of cereal seeds-the most suitable for the various territories-also including a study of wheat leaf rust, a disease which he was the first to discover and study. The use as food of wild species during famines, or of those to be introduced profitably in crops, therefore appears to be of marginal interest. Even though it was initially mentioned by Targioni-Tozzetti, this use was never dealt with later, possibly due to the work being incomplete, since it was expected to include a second volume which was actually never published [54, 55] . This is why there was no discussion about edible wild plants; the topic had been dealt with, only in part, in one of his earlier works [56] , where several spontaneous plants are examined which-added to wheat flour-could be successfully used for bread-making.",

Within this chorotype, specific consideration has been given in this case to 'adventitious' plants, i.e., alien species, now naturalized, which-over the centuries-have found a phytoalimurgic collocation, fully entitled to fit within the multi-faceted framework of traditional regional cuisines. From an ecology perspective, adventitious plants can be considered in most cases species with a pioneering approach and a marked colonizing activity, often invasive, in synanthropic nitrophyle or ruderal habitats [92] . This set of characteristics has allowed them to establish themselves rapidly also on large surfaces. It therefore seemed appropriate to further divide this chorotype into its sub-categories for the purpose of attempting to historically connect and reconnect, although in an approximated form, the beginning of the use of some species in the Italian culinary tradition. In this regard, Table 6 shows that the main flora supplies of alimurgic species, with the exception of Cosmopolitan and Subcosmopolitan plants, come from the American and Asian continent and from desert areas from the Mediterranean to central Asian region (Mediterraneo-Turanian species).

As for southern regions and major islands, the values remain high, which is evidence of on-going and capillary ethnobotanic explorations, complemented by traditional culture legacies which are still present, vital, and can therefore be detected.

It is first of all a way of keeping alive a millenary tradition which will be able to survive, as long as it remains functional, without being limited to mere folklore or museum exhibitions. Even though WEPs in Italy are not a staple food, they are often a key element in cultural representations, in identification processes of a community. An example of this is the cross-border identity which is founded on the phrase 'Mediterranean diet', even though it appears to be highly diversified in terms of local recipe books. The use of WEPs, to sum up, implicitly means accepting as part of one's diet the tenets of a traditional model to be followed which is consistent with the characteristics of the territories. The large variety of plant products available spontaneously (complementary to those from the fields and from the orchard), apart from meeting taste requirements is an important nutraceutical product which can prove advantageous in terms of psycho-physical well-being.",
