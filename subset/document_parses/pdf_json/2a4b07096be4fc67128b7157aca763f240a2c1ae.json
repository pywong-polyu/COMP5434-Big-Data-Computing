            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has forced countries worldwide to make often difficult tradeoffs between health risks and financial costs. These concerns are not always incompatible. Widespread societal illnesses will have adverse economic repercussions as well. But if a country adopts an aggressive policy to reduce the spread of the pandemic, such as a lockdown or stringent social distancing efforts, on balance there will be long run economic costs associated with these dislocations. Similarly, attempts to reopen the economy by relaxing the restrictions may produce some economic gains but will also increase the health risks from the additional exposures. To properly assess whether such policies on balance are worthwhile, it is essential to be able to compare the value of the health risks that are reduced with the economic costs of restrictions. This article presents procedures for monetizing the risks of mortality and morbidity associated with COVID-19 and finds that the costs of these mortality risks should loom quite large in any assessment of the desirability of precautionary actions.",

The pertinent valuation concept is the value of small changes in risk, not the value attached to identified lives. Conflating these concepts is common. During the early stage of the pandemic, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo made the following claim: \"My mother is not expendable. And your mother is not expendable. And our brothers and sisters, they're not expendable.\u2026We're not going to put a dollar figure on human life.\" 1 While this article does not value identified lives, it is feasible to value risks to life consistent with decisions made with respect to other risk-related matters. Following this valuation approach demonstrates the importance of reducing mortality risks and does not devalue these risks.",

            "text": "There is substantial empirical evidence indicating the magnitude of the tradeoff between money and mortality risk based on the preferences of those affected by risks. Empirical evidence on the VSL can be derived from revealed preference evidence on risky decisions by workers or consumers, or by stated preference surveys that elicit valuation amounts for risk reductions (Viscusi 2018b) . Applying these values in a straightforward manner is instructive, but there are several fundamental concerns that have arisen with respect to these valuations. The scale of the pandemic and the subsequent economic dislocations are much greater than in many applications of the VSL, which are usually within the context of specific health, safety, and environmental regulations. The general public typically displays sympathy with those who suffer illnesses, particularly when the illnesses are not the result of moral hazard. However, the scale and prominence of the economic costs of this pandemic have sometimes led to questions about whether for pandemics it is appropriate to use the same benefit value for mortality risks that is usually employed. Examples of such queries and attempts to fine tune the VSL are the following. Does COVID-19 primarily affect those who are very old or who have life-threatening pre-existing conditions, and, if so, should we accord them the same VSL as we would for those with a greater remaining life expectancy? Along the same lines, people who are poor and who have limited access to medical care are faring worse in this pandemic. Should their income status enter into the valuation, reducing the value that their lives receive? More generally, does the magnitude of the health threat undermine the application of conventional benefit assessment approaches?",

            "text": "While the primary focus of public health officials' pronouncements has been on identified positive tests of COVID-19 and the associated mortality rate, most COVID-19 victims do not die. However, many of them do suffer consequential morbidity effects. How should the valuation of these morbidity impacts be conceptualized? Are there sensible reference points for assessing the value of reducing these risks? Based on the estimated value of these health losses, is it important to consider both the mortality and morbidity effects of To provide a sense of the enormity of this pandemic, Section 2 provides a brief overview of the scale of the health impacts to date. Section 3 focuses on my focal VSL figure of $11 million in $2019 for the United States (Viscusi 2018b) . What is the basis for selecting a VSL number? Is it appropriate to use it to value mortality risks from COVID-19, given both the level of the risk and the nature of the health impacts? The most prominent resistance to high valuation amounts in the COVID-19 context has stemmed from concerns about the age and the previous health status of those who have died from COVID-19. Section 4 addresses these and other concerns that surface when attempting to personalize the VSL levels to the circumstances of the particular individuals being protected. Section 5 estimates country-specific global mortality costs by applying international VSL estimates that have been derived from the best United States estimates. After adjustments for income differences across countries, it is feasible to calculate the worldwide COVID-19 mortality cost as well as the loss for each affected country. The potentially important role of morbidity effects is the subject of Section 6. The risk of serious nonfatal health consequences merits a substantial economic value, particularly given the greater frequency of morbidity losses than mortality effects of COVID-19. One implication of the concluding Section 7 is that monetizing the health risks of this pandemic does not require that we jettison the established economic approaches to valuing health risks. However, the crisis may enable us to sharpen the policy practices with respect to dealing with these and other such risks in the future.",

Thus, the appropriate matter for benefit assessment is the marginal change in the risk outcome that will be achieved through the policy. Unless the policies involve undertaking no precautions, the risk outcomes that would have prevailed in the absence of the policy will not be observable. Instead, one must estimate the predicted risk levels using infectious disease models that reflect the contagion risk of coronavirus. Among the more prominent such estimates for the United States were that in the absence of restrictive efforts to address the pandemic, there could be potentially 1-2 million deaths. 2 Benefit-cost analyses of prospective policies have refined these estimates (Thunstrom et al. 2020; Greenstone and Nigam 2020; Robinson, Sullivan, and Shogren 2020) . That these figures greatly exceed the observed number of deaths to date does not necessarily imply that the worst-case projections are faulty. What is being observed are the deaths that occur after precautions have reduced the level of the risk, not the number of deaths that would have occurred if no precautions had been in place.",

As of July 2, 2020, there were 10,847,011 coronavirus cases in the world and 2,781,085 cases in the United States, which accounts for 26% of global cases. Worldwide, the number of cases is 1392 per million population, or a positive coronavirus test risk of just over 1/1000. For the United States, the risk of a positive test per million population is 8402, or a risk of just under 9/1000. The number of deaths in that time period is 519,888 in the world, with 130,813 in the United States, or 25% of the global total. The COVID-19 death rate for the population is 66.7 per million for the world and 395 per million in the United States, or under 1/10,000 in the world and just under 4/10,000 in the United States. Each of these risk levels is comparable to various annual occupational fatality risks, which will serve as a reference point for the valuation of policy interventions. Other countries have also incurred substantial risks, such as Brazil with 60,813 deaths, the U.K. with 43,906 deaths, Italy with 34,788 deaths, France with 29,861 deaths, and Spain with 28,363 deaths. There are also some outliers of countries that have undertaken very effective efforts to control the outbreak, notably New Zealand with 22 deaths and Australia with 104 deaths.",

The attribute that has received considerable attention to date is the variation in the risk by age. Table 1 summarizes the distribution of COVID-19 deaths in the United States from February 1, 2020, to June 20, 2020 for different age groups. These statistics are averages across the entire population. The gender-specific statistics for men and women appear in Appendix Table 4 . In terms of the total number of deaths, it is apparent that the mortality risk escalates quite sharply with age, reaching high values in excess of 10,000 deaths in the age category for all age groups from age 55 and above. As a percentage of all deaths, the age groups beginning with the 45-54 age range each account for at least 5% of the deaths. Despite the increased more general mortality rate of those in older age groups, which leads to a smaller total population at risk from COVID-19 in these groups, the percentage of all COVID-19 deaths accounted for by COVID-19 risks increases with age, reaching a peak of 33% for those age 85 or older. This concentration among the very old population groups may diminish over time as the most vulnerable members of this group die and the disease incidence begins to become more prominent among younger age groups.",

Although these risks are high, they are not outside of the range of risks that are discussed below in studies estimating the VSL for workers facing job risks.

Unlike other health impacts, such as nonfatal morbidity effects, measures of fatality risk are well-defined in terms of their severity. Deaths are also comparatively straightforward to monitor, although the presence of multiple adverse health conditions sometimes complicates conclusions regarding causality. Fatalities also represent the gravest adverse health impact so that reducing this risk will have the largest value for any given COVID-19 patient. As a reflection of the greater ability to monitor fatalities, it is noteworthy that the worldwide statistics on coronavirus risks do not include comparable information on morbidity losses among those who do not die.",

            "text": "The benefit assessment procedure for valuing mortality risks is well-established. The VSL provides information on the local money-risk tradeoff rate for small increases or decreases in the risk level. There are VSL estimates based on revealed preference data using implicit values in market contexts as well as stated preference values derived from surveys on willingness to pay for risk reductions. My emphasis is on labor market estimates of the VSL that are obtained by analyzing the wage premiums that workers receive for occupational fatality risks. There have been over 1000 published labor market estimates of the VSL in this literature, which is reviewed in the meta-analysis in Viscusi (2018a) . Because the VSL is not a natural constant but varies with individual preferences and opportunities, there is heterogeneity in the individual VSL levels. Different studies and different samples will lead to different VSL estimates. For most purposes, it is appropriate to rely on the average VSL for workers to value broad reductions in risk across the population. The estimates that are most reliable are the labor market estimates in which the fatality risk values based on the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI) data are matched to workers in the employment sample. The potential role of publication selection effects in biasing empirical estimates, including those pertaining to the VSL, is well established (Stanley and Doucouliagos 2012) . Researchers may choose to submit for publication only those results that are consistent with previous estimates in the literature. Similarly, reviewers and journal editors may be unwilling to publish VSL estimates that are outside of the range reported in previous studies. Adjustments for publication selection effects for the VSL account for such influences and generally result in lower estimated VSL amounts after the bias correction. The focal estimate in Viscusi (2018b) of $10 million in $2015 was based on bias-corrected estimates using the CFOI. The genesis of this value was two previous meta-regression analyses of VSL estimates using the CFOI data. Viscusi (2015) reported a VSL estimate of $9.6 million in $2013, which now has an inflationadjusted value in $2019 of $10.6 million. The $9.6 million bias-adjusted VSL estimate in $2015 reported in Viscusi and Masterman (2017a and b) has a value in $2019 of $10.5 million. These estimates are derived from meta-regression analyses of the best estimates drawn from particular studies, i.e., the estimates based on the single most preferred estimate in the judgment of the authors or the reviewer of the literature. Alternatively, Viscusi (2018a) derives a bias-adjusted CFOI estimate of the VSL based on the full set of VSL estimates from all CFOI studies rather than the single preferred estimate from each of the studies. Doing so avoids potential biases resulting from the selection of the best estimate, but may have the downside of including less preferred equation specifications. The bias-adjusted estimates, which vary depending on the treatment of the other variables in the analysis, are $9.6 million for the sample of all estimates and $11.4 million for the sample of best estimates, where these figures are in $2015. Converted to $2019, the all-set VSL is $10.4 million and the best-set value is $12.4 million. For purposes of the calculations in this article, I will use a focal United States VSL value of $11 million. This value is in the general range as those used by U.S. government agencies. 4 Other empirical estimates of the VSL are in a similar general range, but are somewhat higher if they are not adjusted for publication selection effects. It is instructive to review some of these values to provide an alternative perspective on the choice of the VSL. The VSL literature review in Viscusi and Aldy (2003) preceded the use of the CFOI data and reported a median VSL of $10.3 million in $2019. The first VSL estimates using the CFOI were reported in Viscusi (2004) and were $11.2 million ($2019) for the male blue-collar sample, which is the principal locus of jobs with fatality risks. The panel data estimates for job changers reported in Kniesner et al. (2012) yielded a VSL of $9.2 million based on single years of CFOI data and $12.8 million using three-year averages of CFOI data, where all estimates are in $2019. Although there are numerous other VSL estimates in the literature, the meta-analysis in Viscusi (2018a) is a comprehensive review of these estimates as well as the estimates from other studies. After converting the values to $2019, the reported sample mean VSL estimate based on CFOI studies is $13.2 million for the all-set sample and $13.3 million for the best-set sample. The $11 million VSL figure that I will use for the discussion in this article consequently is about $2 million below the mean estimated VSL implied by the CFOI estimates without any adjustment for publication selection effects. Sensitivity analysis for the results below using a $13 million figure rather than $11 million is straightforward.",

            "text": "Income levels are an important driver of how much people are willing to pay to reduce risks and how much they must be compensated to incur an increase in risk. The VSL varies with income levels across the population within a country, across time for a country with changing income levels, and across countries at different stages of economic development. There is a very large literature on the income elasticity of the VSL, much of which is reviewed in Viscusi and Aldy (2003) and Masterman and Viscusi (2018) . The emphasis here is on the income elasticity numbers that will be used for the United States and the international average for countries outside the United States. 5 For changes in income within the United States, I use an income elasticity figure of 0.6 based on the recent meta-regression analysis in Viscusi and Masterman (2017a and b) , which estimates a U.S. income elasticity value between 0.5 and 0.7. A previous meta-regression analysis by Doucouliagos et al. (2014) accounting for publication selection effects found an income elasticity range from 0.25 to 0.63. The main use of U.S. income elasticity figures by government agencies has been with respect to updating estimates of the VSL over time to account for increases in societal income levels. However, it could also be used to adjust the VSL to correspond to the income levels of those affected by COVID-19. For international differences, I adopt an income elasticity figure of 1.0. The international unitary income elasticity figure is consistent with the meta-regression analyses of revealed preference labor market data in Viscusi and Masterman (2017a and b) , which yielded an income elasticity estimate for which it was not possible to reject the hypothesis that the elasticity is 1.0 in any of the specifications. Similarly, a meta-regression analysis of stated preference data in Masterman and Viscusi (2018) estimated an overall income elasticity of the VSL across countries of 0.94 to 1.05. I use an international income elasticity of 1.0 in analyzing the worldwide costs of COVID-19. The international income elasticity estimates plays a pivotal role in international analyses presented in Section 5, as it is used to project the U.S. VSL estimates to other countries based on differences in income levels across the countries.",

Larger risk changes arise when considering global decisions such as whether we should undertake a comprehensive social distancing policy that will greatly reduce the risk.

Consider a starting mortality risk value for the population from COVID-19 of 1/1000. Suppose that the particular policy action being considered will reduce the risk from 1/1000 to 1/10,000. Because of the shape of the utility function and the constant expected utility locus that is tangent to the market offer curve, large risk changes do not have the same value as very small local changes in the risk. Viewed from the standpoint of individual willingness to pay for risk reductions, when the risk change is very large there are important income effects as individual resources become depleted when purchasing large risk reductions. Then for logarithmic utility functions, the willingness-to-pay (WTP) amount is 8% less than the VSL would be for small changes in risk. Similarly, for risk increases from 1/10,000 to 1/1000, the willingness-to-accept (WTA) amount is 10% greater than the VSL. Using a different functional form, Hammitt (2020) also provides evidence of the variation in the valuation of risks with the magnitude of the risk change.",

Except for such global protection decisions involving the choice of whether to undertake any COVID-19 precautions, most risk changes for policies are small, making the VSL the pertinent number. The policy decisions with respect to reopening particular activities such as salons and dining tend to involve small risks. Even a policy change that will lead to 100,000 additional expected deaths in the United States involves an increased risk probability of 3/10,000, which is comparable to some high-risk jobs, so that no major modifications of the VSL are warranted.",

Occupational fatality risks that are captured in the risk measures in these studies are traumatic injuries that often lead to deaths that occur fairly soon after the traumatic event. There is an important morbidity component to the labor market VSL for these acute injuries, as estimated in Gentry and Viscusi (2016) . Whether the morbidity effects of being killed in an occupational accident are greater or less than for COVID-19 is unclear. Another possible reference point that would boost benefit values is if COVID-19 morbidity effects were comparable to those associated with risks of cancer, for which there is often a prolonged morbidity period. Cancer risk studies generally show a premium for cancer risks as compared to traumatic risks, with the values being 21% greater for bladder cancer (Viscusi, Huber, and Bell 2014) than for mortality risks from motorvehicle accidents. The literature also includes premiums for other forms of cancer (e.g., see Van Houtven et al. 2008) . There may or may not be a compelling rationale for adding a morbidity valuation premium to deaths from COVID-19, but it is important to recognize that equating mortality risks from COVID-19 to occupational fatality risks incorporates important benefit transfer assumptions including both the loss of one's life and the severity of the comparative health consequences of the fatal events.",

The number of COVID-19 deaths peaks among those age 85 and older, which accounts for one-third of all deaths. The age distribution of COVID-19 deaths is tilted toward a much more senior group than is reflected in studies of VSL in the labor market. The average age of workers in the VSL studies is age 40. Under 3% of the COVID-19 deaths are for people at or below that age. This age difference between the labor market and COVID-19 victims is consequential since most VSL studies only estimate VSL figures for those who are in the principal pre-retirement years. Researchers generally cap the upper age of the sample at ages linked to social security benefit eligibility, such as limiting the sample to workers under age 62 or under age 65. There is consequently a two decades' gap between the upper age limit for the VSL study estimates and the peak COVID-19 mortality group consisting of those age 85 or older. Given the age distribution of COVID-19 deaths, should the evaluation of the COVID-19 mortality risks use the average VSL for all workers in the policy assessment, following the usual practice of government agencies? Or should there be some recognition that individual willingness to pay for risk reduction is likely to vary with age?

Posing the question of whether there should be age variations in the VSL generates controversy, particularly when the heterogeneity in VSL results in the devaluation of life relative to the national average. Any reduction in the VSL for older people in effect takes something away from them that they had previously. The likely presence of an endowment effect with respect to the value the government places on their lives will be a source of opposition to such a devaluation. When the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency attempted to make adjustments for age in its regulatory impact analysis for the Clear Skies Initiative, there was substantial public outcry (Viscusi 2018b) . Reducing the VSL for those over age 65 by 37% did not have a transparent justification and led to critiques such as \"Seniors on sale, 37% off\" and \"What's a Granny worth?\" Whether one should embark on making such age adjustments depends on the magnitude of the life expectancy difference, the economic rationale for the adjustment, and the extent to which it is likely to be consequential. The view advocated here is that if there is recognition of the heterogeneity of the VSL, then it should be comprehensive and not restricted to age alone.",

The peak remaining life expectancy is 77.1 years for the under age 5 group, and remaining life expectancy declines steadily with age. COVID-19 victims may have somewhat lower life expectancies than the population average to the extent that they have serious pre-existing conditions. Although there is some evidence that COVID-19 deaths are often accompanied by other adverse conditions before the death (Stokes et al. 2020) , in the absence of available data to refine the life expectancy statistics I will rely on the average life expectancy figures in Table 2 . COVID-19 incidence rates and life expectancy figures also can be constructed by gender, and these values appear as Appendix Table 5 . Men suffer greater mortality rates from COVID-19 than do women. For the average 40-year-old worker in VSL studies, the remaining life expectancy is an additional 40.7 years in the age group 35-44. The remaining life expectancy continues to drop with age to a value of 6.6 years for the high-risk group of those age 85 and over. 6 The expected number of life years lost statistics in Table 2 represent the expected number of life years lost to the individual in each age group. It is the product of the remaining life expectancy for that age group and the mortality risk to people in each age group from COVID-19, which appears in the final column in Table 1 . Those who are age 85 and older suffer an expected number of life years lost equal to 0.04. Even for other age groups, the expected number of life years lost for members of each age group are not great because the probabilities of death from COVID-19 remain low. These statistics place the overall extent of the harm in context. What is pertinent from the standpoint of assessing benefits from reducing mortality risks is the loss that is being prevented conditional upon dying from the disease. For those who are age 85 or older, this loss is 6.6 years of life lost, which is still a substantial welfare loss.",

Studies that have explored variations in the VSL with age using age-specific occupational fatality rates have generally found that the VSL exhibits an inverted-U shaped pattern with respect to age. The VSL in most labor market studies peaks in the 45-54 age group, where the estimated VSL exceeds the average for all workers. This is also the age range where the risk of death from COVID-19 begins to escalate. The VSL for older age groups declines from this peak, but even for workers in their early sixties the VSL typically remains higher than that of 24-year-olds. Unfortunately, labor market estimates of the VSL do not pertain to the three oldest age groups in Tables 1 and 2.

In their analysis, the VSLY is not a constant, but instead is estimated as an average value for each worker age group. The VSLY peaks at $593,000 at age 54 in the regular regressions and at a value of $555,000 at age 45 in the cohort-adjusted estimates. The age-related trajectory of the cohort-adjusted VSLY for older age groups remains relatively flat after the peak, as it declines by just over 10% from the peak for those age 62. The estimates reported by Viscusi and Hersch (2008) Human Services. 7 If there is no discounting of the VSLY figures for years of life being valued, then the constructed VSL is simply the product of the VSLY and the number of years of remaining life expectancy. Using a zero discount rate that in effects weights the VSLY for all years of life equally, the constructed VSL is $3.3 million for those at least age 85, $4.6 million for those age 75-84, $7.9 million for those 65-74, and $11.7 million for those 55-64, which I will cap at the economy-wide value of $11 million in the calculations below. Discounting the sum of the VSLY amounts for the remaining life reduces these amounts, but they still remain substantial. Based on the 3% real rate of interest used in calculating the VSLY, the constructed VSL is $3.0 million for those age 85 and above. For those age 75-84, the constructed VSL is $4.1 million. The constructed VSL for the age 65-74 age group is $6.4 million, and the VSL is $8.5 million for those age 55-64. For the other age groups, I make no reduction in the VSL below the average economy-wide VSL.",

Let the VSL applied to all deaths below age 55 be $11 million, and the VSL for those in the other age groups be given by the estimates above. Weighting the VSL for each age group by their percentage of total COVID-19 deaths, the average economy-wide VSL based on the VSLY estimates is $6.1 million using a zero discount rate to calculate the VSLY, or 45% below the $11 million value, and $5.2 million using a 3% discount rate to calculate the VSLY, which is 53% below the $11 million value. Shifting from use of a single economy-wide VSL to an age-adjusted VSL constructed based on estimates of the VSLY in conjunction with remaining life expectancy reduces the applicable VSL by about half. The large extent of the reduction in the VSL is attributable to the skewed nature of the distribution of COVID-19 deaths, coupled with the level of the VSLY.",

From an equity standpoint, using the same VSL for all individuals is equitable in that it treats reduction of risks to all lives as being equally valuable. Moreover, given the widespread governmental practice of valuing mortality risks of all population segments equally except in a very few notable situations, using the average VSL for labor market risks is consistent with this practice. There also may be broadly based altruistic concerns with valuing all lives equally, as was reflected in the public outcry after the Clear Skies Initiative debacle. Alternatively, it is possible to provide an equity-based rationale for using a lower VSL that is constructed using the VSLY estimates. One can view using the same VSLY for everybody as being equitable in that each expected year of every person's life receives an equal weight. From the standpoint of efficient risk regulation, what matters is whether the individual WTP and WTA amounts for mortality risk reduction decline with age and, if so, to what extent. The age-adjusted estimates derived using the VSLY are more accurate reflections of the underlying WTP values of those affected. While the calculations below value mortality risks using an average VSL of $11 million, it is straightforward to perform a sensitivity analysis on the results using the age-adjusted estimates derived from the VSLY. The back-of-the-envelope version of such a sensitivity analysis would be to divide the mortality risk reduction benefits by half, which will still yield very substantial benefits given the magnitude of the mortality risks.",

These essential workers also may incur greater risks to the extent that they rely on public transportation. Inequities also arise for the poor who lack excellent medical care and are at greater risk. The combination of influences such as race, occupation, and inadequate health care tend to tilt the distribution of COVID-19 risks and mortality rates toward segments of the population that have lower income levels. To the extent that the income levels of those affected are below those of the average worker in VSL studies, one can make an income elasticity adjustment using a United States VSL income elasticity value of 0.6.

Recognition of societal concern with these deaths would be consistent with the impetus of equitable risk tradeoffs.

In the case of those who die from COVID-19 there may be associated pain and suffering that creates a welfare loss to the individual. As was discussed in Section 3, if these morbidity losses are more severe than those of occupational deaths, then it would be desirable to add a premium to the VSL. The focus of the discussion in this section is on the morbidity effects of those who do not die. The statistics in Table 3 indicate that just over 5% of all laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 patients die. The 95% of other patients who do not die constitute a much larger group. As a consequence, the morbidity effects that are experienced by those who do not die may affect the overall monetization of the benefits of reducing COVID-19 risks. In the absence of empirical estimates of the WTP values specifically associated with COVID-19, the benefit assessment approach must rely on the transfer of benefit values for risks of health consequences of comparable severity. The focus here is on morbidity risk estimates for similar environmental illnesses and the morbidity component of fatal job accidents. Kniesner and Sullivan (2020) explore a different benefit transfer reference point than the used here, focusing on the implicit value attached to nonfatal job injury risks and also taking into account the potential undercounting of the morbidity effects.",

Studies of the benefits associated with the control of asthma also address respiratory issues, though these may understate the health impacts of the less consequential COVID-19 morbidity effects. O'Conor and Blomquist (1997) found an annual value of controlling asthma equal to $2200 per year for adults, based on a $9 million VSL. In $2019, this loss would be about $3700 per year. In a subsequent study, Blomquist, Dickie, and O'Connor (2011) estimated a value of asthma control of $1700 for adults in their fifties and sixties, or $2000 in $2019. Suppose that for the purposes of valuing these minor health effects that one adopts a unit benefit value of $3000. Consider the 82% of the patients with positive test results but who are not asymptomatic, hospitalized, or dead. Application of these benefit values to the total number of positive test cases in Table 3 would generate a benefit value of (0.82) x (1,320,488) x $3000 = $3.3 billion. This amount has a value comparable to preventing 295 deaths if each fatality is valued at $11 million. By way of comparison, the total value of preventing the deaths for the time period indicated in Table 3 is $784 billion, where this figure pertains to a shorter time period than the data in Appendix Table 6 . Consideration of the minor health impacts resulting from COVID-19 increases the benefit assessment by 0.4%. The more serious morbidity consequences are less frequent, but have a much greater unit benefit value. Suppose that all those who are reported as dead in Table 3 were originally hospitalized. Of the 185,673 hospitalized patients, 71,116 died, and 113,557 patients who were hospitalized did not die. By assuming that all deaths occurred after being hospitalized, this procedure understates the number of nonfatal hospital admissions due to COVID-19. To establish a unit benefit value for the morbidity effects of nonfatal hospitalizations, I draw on two different benefit transfer reference points, one of which is based on stated preference valuations and the other is drawn from estimates of the morbidity component of fatal job injuries. Each of these approaches generates large benefit numbers that increase the importance of preventing coronavirus illnesses.",

Although some of the symptoms associated with the ailment may have long-term impacts, that also appears to be the case with COVID-19. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency regulatory impact analyses for proposed regulations have frequently used this unit benefits measure to value diverse risks of respiratory ailments caused by air pollution exposures. The study used a risk-risk tradeoff formulation in which respondents on average evaluated a case of chronic bronchitis as tantamount to a 0.32 probability of death.

The VSL is comprised of the value associated with the risk of incurring morbidity effects as a consequence of the fatal event, plus the value associated with the risk of terminating one's life. The labor market estimates of the VSL are based on traumatic occupational fatalities, most of which have a short period of morbidity. Overall, 82% of all fatally injured workers die within a day. Almost all fatally injured workers die within 3 months of the incident. The morbidity component of these injuries ranges from 6% to 25% of the VSL. The upper end of this range is below the chronic bronchitis value frequently used to value adverse respiratory effects. Because the COVID-19 hospitalizations have a longer duration than a single day, it may be reasonable to adopt the 25% estimate of the job-related morbidity value, leading to a morbidity effect of 0.25 x $11 million = $2.75 million. For the 113,557 nonfatal hospitalized patients in Table 3 , the value of the morbidity loss is $312 billion. Even at the lower end of the morbidity value estimate, the loss is substantial. Based on the 6% estimate of the occupational fatality morbidity share of the VSL, the morbidity cost per expected hospitalization with COVID-19 is 0.06 x $11 million = $0.66 million. Using this lower figure, the value of the morbidity loss for the 113,557 hospitalized patients who do not die is $74.9 billion.",

The mortality risk worldwide is $3.5 trillion based on income-adjusted VSL estimates for these countries. These mortality cost amounts assume that the VSL that is applicable to the population in general is also pertinent to valuing the risks of COVID-19. Undertaking an age adjustment based on the current incidence rate would reduce the mortality costs by almost half. Making such an adjustment would be inconsistent with typical applications of the VSL in regulatory analyses, which generally use a uniform value. However, with over 80% of the COVID-19 deaths occurring among those who are age 65 or over, discussions of using age-adjusted VSL levels have increased. Attempts to devalue the COVID-19 deaths through age adjustments are likely to meet substantial resistance, as in the case of past efforts to adopt a \"senior discount\" for the VSL.",

Attempts to reflect the heterogeneity of the VSL should not be selective and restricted to age adjustments alone. COVID-19 also has a disproportionate impact on lower income groups, those with poor medical care, and African Americans. If the lives of older people are being devalued because they have lower personal valuations of risk, then a consistent valuation approach would also devalue the lives of the groups who are among the most vulnerable to COVID-19. At the very least, before embarking on any VSL adjustments for age there should be recognition that age differences are not the only pertinent source of VSL heterogeneity. Application of equity concepts such as an equitable risk tradeoffs approach would retain the economywide VSL for COVID-19, but there are other reasonable equity concepts or strict efficiency concepts that some might advance. For a wide diversity of different criteria, it is feasible to monetize these risks using the unit benefit estimates in this article.",

Mortality risks are the most highly valued health risks resulting from COVID-19, but the valuation of the morbidity risks is also quite substantial. Many people suffer these morbidity effects, which often are minor but sometimes are sufficiently severe to require hospitalization. Extrapolation based on other morbidity studies suggests that taking into account the morbidity losses boosts the total estimated value of the health risks by perhaps as much as 40%, and certainly accounts for at least a lower bound increase of 10%. Further studies could refine the morbidity benefit values, but regardless it is clear that the morbidity consequences of this pandemic are quite substantial as well. To the extent that analysts choose to use a lower age-adjusted VSL, the relative contribution of morbidity effects to the total benefit value will be enhanced.",
