The principal concern of this work is that polarization undermines bipartisan consensus for the grand strategy of liberal internationalism that often guided US foreign policy in the post-World War II era (Kupchan and Trubowitz 2007; Jervis et al. 2018) . In the words of Peter Trubowitz and Peter Harris, hyper-partisanship, the absence of a compelling foreign policy narrative, and the erosion of the domestic social contract have weakened America's \"domestic political capacity to translate [\u2026] power assets into international influence\" (Trubowitz and Harris 2019: 621) . In a similar vein, Daniel Drezner writes that the \"American foundations undergirding the liberal international order are in grave danger\" (Drezner 2019: 10) . 2 Kenneth Schultz has highlighted additional effects of polarization, explaining how it makes US foreign policy less reliable, less capable of learning from past mistakes, and more vulnerable to harmful external influences (Schultz 2017) . In a 2018 survey, US foreign policy professionals even ranked domestic polarization as the most critical threat to the USA (Smeltz et al. 2018) . But some work points to the resilience of US support for liberal internationalism, highlighting ways in which domestic institutions and international realities constrain nationalist leaders from fully institutionalizing \"America First\" policies, and explaining why US leaders will continue to have incentives to pursue internationalist policies in an interconnected world (Chaudoin et al. 2018 (Chaudoin et al. , 2021 Ikenberry 2020) .",

Moreover, the effects of polarization in particular foreign policy domains, such as international negotiations or military operations, are largely unexplored. With the existence and strength of a liberal international order being contingent in part on sustained US engagement, it is important to better understand the repercussions of polarization for America's international commitment. The need for more research on these topics is only enhanced by the legacy left by Donald Trump, whose nationalist agenda and particularly partisan approach to politics presented especially strong challenges both to remaining reservoirs of bipartisanship and to key mechanisms of international cooperation (Jacobson 2017; Jervis et al. 2018; Stokes 2018) .",

Debates on issues ranging from climate change and immigration (Smeltz 2022) , to arms control (B\u00f6ller 2022), to the conduct of war (Lee 2022) , to foreign policy spending (Bendix and Jeong 2022 ) reveal large and/or growing gaps between the preferences of Democrats or liberals, on the one hand, and Republicans or conservatives, on the other. Even views on some issues that previously exhibited little partisan divergence, such as attitudes toward China, Russia, and the Israel-Palestinian conflict, have recently become more polarized (Smeltz 2022) . Members of Congress are also traveling abroad with lawmakers from the other party less often, reflecting a weakening social fabric on Capitol Hill (McGee and Theriault 2022).",

The increased use by Congress of spending restrictions shows that lawmakers can adapt to political constraints in ways that enable them to maintain policy influence (Carcelli 2022) . The role of ideology as a driver of congressional behavior can also enable Congress to act as a source of policy innovation (Bendix and Jeong 2022) , while the intraparty divisions that characterize some foreign policy debates can foster the emergence of new ideas, policy entrepreneurs, and cross-cutting coalitions (Friedrichs 2022; Homan and Lantis 2022) . Overall, though, the authors provide a variety of important cautionary tales about ways in which polarization can make it more difficult to carry out an effective foreign policy.",

Whereas liberals favor a cooperative approach to international politics and prefer non-military to military instruments of national power, conservatives are warier of multilateral mechanisms and more supportive of military might (Wittkopf 1990; Holsti 2004; Broz 2011; Rathbun 2012; Gries 2014; Milner and Tingley 2015; Jeong and Quirk 2019; Wenzelburger and B\u00f6ller 2019; Raunio and Wagner 2020; Smeltz et al. 2020; Flynn and Fordham 2021) . At the same time, US debates over some foreign policy issues, including international alliances, economic sanctions, humanitarian intervention, and human rights, do not break down consistently along left-right lines (Cutrone and Fordham 2010; Maxey, 2020; Busby et al. 2020; Tama 2020; Kertzer et al. 2021 ). In addition, many issues, such as international trade and foreign aid, involve both interparty and intraparty divisions (Th\u00e9rien and N\u00f6el 2000; Milner and Judkins 2004; Milner and Tingley 2010; Prather 2016; Rathbun 2016) . In short, liberals and conservatives are strongly polarized on some major foreign policy questions, but the overall alignment between left-right ideology and foreign policy preferences is highly imperfect.",

On the one hand, scholars have established that citizens have certain core values that shape their worldviews, suggesting that the public forms some of their own judgments about international issues Kertzer and Zeitzoff 2017) . Public attitudes, in turn, sometimes influence the decision-making of leaders, particularly on salient issues (Aldrich et al. 2006; Foyle 2017 ). On the other hand, studies have shown that cues from leaders and other elites can themselves greatly shape public attitudes on foreign policy (Zaller 1992; Berinsky 2009; Guisinger and Saunders 2017) . One consequence of this elite cue dynamic is that polarization among elites tends to filter down and exacerbate ideological polarization among the public (cf. Westwood 2019).",

            "text": "Dina Smeltz examines preference polarization in public attitudes on foreign policy, drawing on a long-running series of surveys conducted by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs (Smeltz 2022) . She finds that polarization in public foreign policy views is increasing overall, but some issues are far more polarized than others. Democrats and Republicans still largely agree on the big-picture framework and goals of US foreign policy, supporting active engagement in the world, security alliances, overseas military bases, and international trade. Consistent with long-standing liberal-conservative divisions, polarization is much greater on some key means of foreign policy, such as the importance of multilateral institutions and military superiority. Most strikingly, polarization with respect to threat perceptions has jumped in recent years, with Republicans more concerned about hard security threats, such as the rise of China and international terrorism, and Democrats more concerned about the COVID-19 pandemic, climate change, and racial and economic inequality at home. These differences reveal that Democrats and Republicans do not even agree about which types of issues should demand government attention. Smeltz also discusses how presidential messaging on some hot-button issues, particularly under Donald Trump, has exacerbated polarization. Sarah Maxey tackles another dimension of public attitudes, using original survey experiments to explore the influence of affective polarization on the American public's support for military intervention (Maxey 2022) . She finds that the impact of affective polarization on public support for military action varies across types of intervention and between Democrats and Republicans. Whereas affective polarization makes it harder for presidents to gain bipartisan support for interventions motivated by security goals, it does not limit the ability of presidents to achieve bipartisan backing for humanitarian interventions. In another important nuance, Democratic and Republican leaders face different political landscapes on the use of force, as the greater support of Republican citizens for military action makes it is easier for Democratic presidents than for Republican presidents to gain bipartisan support when deploying the military into combat. The upshot is that debates over the use of force are not immune to polarizing dynamics, but there exist important distinctions in the politics of military intervention debates.",

Whereas much research on congressional decision-making focuses solely on the voting behavior of lawmakers, Bendix and Jeong evaluate contributors to both legislative cosponsorship and legislative votes. They find that ideological preferences strongly influence both cosponsorship and voting decisions, with liberals favoring amendments that limit defense spending and conservatives favoring amendments that limit foreign aid. While party identities also influence voting patterns on these limitation riders, ideological preferences play a more important role. More broadly, their study suggests that liberal and conservative ideologies greatly shape how members of Congress approach foreign policy issues.",

While most studies of congressional views hone in on the roles of liberal and conservative ideology, Homan and Lantis underscore differences in the attitudes of legislators regarding the exercise of power in Washington. Based on an examination of congressional votes concerning the use of force during the Obama and Trump administrations, they find that progressives and conservatives possessing anti-establishment views often split from their party leaders and align with each other in seeking to restrict the authority of the executive branch to deploy the military overseas. Even when such intraparty factions are relatively small, they have the potential to shape legislative outcomes when Congress is closely divided between the two parties, as it has typically been in recent years.",

A key observation by scholars is that the alignment of political ideologies and partisanship has led to partisan conflict in Congress with the goal to prevent political achievements of the opposition (Theriault 2013; Hetherington and Rudolph 2015) . Recent polling shows that the most salient reason why Americans identify with a political party-besides their party's policies-is the conception that the other party will do harm to the country (Pew Research Center 2018). At the same time, partisan warfare has been exacerbated by the small size of congressional majorities and frequent turnover of party control on Capitol Hill in recent years, which provides parties with a greater incentive to focus on partisan competition (Lee 2016) .",

James Bryan and Jordan Tama examine the frequency and character of congressional bipartisanship on international issues compared to domestic ones (Bryan and Tama 2022) . Analyzing an original data set of nearly 3000 important congressional votes since the end of the Cold War, Bryan and Tama find that severe cases of polarization, in which more than 90 percent of the members of the two parties vote on opposite sides, remain the exception in US foreign policy debates. In addition, they find that, overall, Congress is less polarized on international issues than on domestic issues. By distinguishing among different forms of foreign policy bipartisanship-pro-presidential, anti-presidential, and cross-partisanship-they provide a more nuanced conception of the relationship between partisan polarization and bipartisanship rates in Congress. While pro-presidential bipartisanship characterizes most foreign policy votes, anti-presidential bipartisanship occurs strikingly often as well. Moreover, Bryan and Tama find that bipartisanship rates vary across policy domains, with international security issues enjoying more bipartisan consensus than international economic issues. Overall, their findings suggest that despite increasing ideological distance between members of both parties, Congress remains capable of addressing international issues and enacting its constitutional role as check and balancer of the executive branch. Shannon Carcelli argues that polarization and gridlock in Congress have incentivized legislators to turn to unorthodox foreign policymaking, particularly on foreign aid policy (Carcelli 2022) . Through the use of limitation riders (specifications written within an appropriations bill that limit the administration's policy discretion), members of Congress seek to limit the allocation of aid to other countries or prevent spending foreign aid money for particular purposes. Carcelli shows that through the shift from more traditional means of foreign policy legislating to the increased use of appropriations bills to shape foreign policy, Congress has been quite assertive and influential despite high levels of partisan polarization. Quantitatively, she finds evidence for an increase in the use of foreign aid limitation riders as polarization increases. Qualitatively, she shows how the content of limitation riders is stronger in high-polarization eras, as the topics of riders shift from budgets and contracting issues to more substantive specifications regarding recipient countries and types of aid. In addition, her findings indicate that an increase in congressional conservatism decreases the use of limitation riders, suggesting that liberal majorities struggle more to authorize foreign aid by traditional means.",

They observe that congressional travels abroad have historically facilitated cordiality and civility in Congress, as well as motivated legislators to reach across the aisle to foster bipartisan consensus. Their analysis of overseas trips, known as Congressional Delegations (CODELS), from 1977 to 2018 reveals that Democrats with ideologically extreme views travel abroad more often only with co-partisans, and that both Democrats and Republicans with ideologically extreme views engage in fewer bipartisan trips abroad. Combined, their results suggest that ideological extremism and partisan warfare are shaping not only the voting behavior, but also the social interactions, of members of Congress. This increased social polarization, in a vicious cycle, threatens in turn to exacerbate polarization in the legislative process: just as party polarization decreases the opportunity for members of Congress to develop personal relationships with each other, the lack of strong personal relationships across the aisle makes it more difficult for members of Congress to craft bipartisan legislation later.",

Scholars of US foreign policy have shown that over time, the highly contentious forces of domestic politics in some policy areas, such as international economics, have incentivized the president to rely more heavily on other instruments, such as military deployments and defense procurement (Milner and Tingley 2015) . Others have shown that partisan incentives have reduced presidents' use of force abroad and influenced how presidents carry out military operations (Howell and Pevehouse, 2007; Kriner 2010) . Meanwhile, others have found that greater prospects for legislative success incline the president to engage in more high-risk military interventions and fewer humanitarian interventions (Marshall and Prins 2016) . In addition, studies on presidential use of executive agreements suggest that domestic polarization inclines presidents to advance their agenda unilaterally (Caruson and Farrar-Myers 2007; Amirfar and Singh 2018) .",

Arms control treaties have been a key element of the liberal international order under US global leadership and have contributed to global security and disarmament. Via a crisp-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis, he evaluates 24 cases of US decisions on international arms control treaties from 1963 to 2021, followed by a brief case study of the Trump administration's withdrawal from several agreements. B\u00f6ller finds that the strength of conservative treaty skeptics in the US Senate contributed to the demise of arms control policies since the end of the Cold War. In turn, the president's party affiliation appears to be less decisive for the US role, although Democratic presidents are more likely to support a booster role. In addition, the perceived reciprocity, or \"tit for tat,\" embedded in the treaty, is an important condition that shapes US treaty behavior. Overall, the ideology of senators, particularly their skepticism toward multilateral commitments, places a key structural constraint on US international treaty making. As a result, B\u00f6ller argues, changes in the presidency, from Trump to Biden, for example, are insufficient to transform US arms control policy.",

Facilitating trade liberalization through multilateral organizations and free trade agreements has been characteristic of US global leadership and the liberal international order since the end of World War II. By relying on a new dataset of congressional letters and cosponsorship alliances, Friedrichs derives trade policy preferences from members of Congress and their ideological dispositions. Via a structured-focused comparison of two cases of US trade policy-the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement and the US-Mexico-Canada-Agreement-he shows that both parties are intrinsically polarized between free and fair trade preferences. However, the relative strength of ideological factions within both parties determines when legislators can build cross-cutting coalitions in support of trade agreements. In addition, both case studies reveal that intraparty preference polarization incentivizes the executive branch to pursue side-payments and issue linkage in international trade negotiations, in an effort to forge cross-party ratification majorities. Overall, these findings indicate that interparty polarization induces intraparty polarization and bears the potential to generate foreign policy realignments.",

Lee argues that liberals and conservatives interpret wartime casualties very differently from each other, which has significant implications for public support for war and presidential decisions regarding military intervention. Using three survey experiments, she assesses how ideology and party influence casualty sensitivity. Her findings reveal that conservatives are less likely than liberals to change their support for military operations in response to increases in casualties. This pattern holds under both Democratic and Republican presidents, suggesting that ideology rather than partisanship is the key driver of it. Lee's results suggest that Republican presidents have strong incentives to pursue gains on the battlefield, while Democratic presidents have strong incentives to limit the number of US casualties. With polarization steadily increasing, ideological differences in the public's perception of warfare will likely translate into wide swings in military strategy from administration to administration, undermining international trust in US security leadership.",

The US-UK special relationship has been considered a pillar of the liberal international order and one that has proven particularly resilient despite various crises. Based on a survey experiment involving 2000 adults in the United Kingdom, Myrick demonstrates how US domestic polarization negatively impacts British citizens' perception of the bilateral relationship. She shows how foreign perceptions of extreme US polarization weaken British willingness to engage in future partnerships with the US because of an erosion of a bipartisan commitment to liberal norms, multilateralism, and an open world economy. Furthermore, her findings reveal that polarization in the US increases skepticism of American global leadership due to anticipation that US foreign policy will be more likely to change with executive turnover and thus be less predictable. She further highlights that these negative reputational consequences due to polarization are primarily driven by preference polarization between Republicans and Democrats, rather than by affective polarization. Myrick's findings contribute to our understanding of some of the broader international consequences of domestic polarization, particularly in increasing uncertainty around future US foreign policy.",

The answers to some questions related to polarization and foreign policy are clear from these and other studies. On the whole, foreign policy has not been immune from the rising levels of preference, affective, social, and partisan polarization that have characterized American politics in recent decades. From the public to members of Congress, Democrats and Republicans have diverged in their views and behavior on international issues. This rising polarization has had a series of concerning effects, from an increase in US unilateralism to a decline in America's international cooperation capacity and overseas reputation.

More research is needed to further enhance understanding of the relative importance of interparty polarization and intraparty divisions. Further studies could also shed light on the specific alignment of different types of polarization (ideological, affective, social, partisan) across and within foreign policy areas. Given existing comprehensive work on the causes and drivers of polarization in the domestic context, additional work on the extent to which the repercussions of US global interdependencies and costly public goods provisions have become themselves drivers of partisan or ideological polarization could be particularly promising (cf. Colgan and Keohane 2017; Norrl\u00f6f 2018) .

This would enhance understanding of the conditions that facilitate bipartisan rather than partisan congressional opposition to presidential policies. Another way to advance this debate would be to shift some attention from congressional behavior to presidential decision-making, using process-tracing or other qualitative methods to examine the extent to which the president and other executive branch officials take into account congressional views and positions when making important foreign policy decisions.",

To date, most work on the foreign policy effects of polarization, including several of the special issue papers, has focused on how polarization can alter policy making dynamics in Washington or change the international conduct of the USA (Schultz 2017; B\u00f6ller 2022; Friedrichs 2022; Lee 2022) . This body of work presents important findings on the reliability of American democracy and US capacity to provide global public goods in the light of domestic division, populism, and institutional corrosion (cf. Daalder and Lindsay 2018; Diamond 2019; Musgrave 2019; Norrl\u00f6f 2020). Myrick takes this research agenda a step further by investigating the effects of polarization on overseas attitudes toward the USA (Myrick 2022 ). An implication of her paper is that if overseas attitudes change, the behavior of foreign governments will also likely change. But to what extent are foreign governments actually acting differently-for instance, by pursuing alternatives to partnerships with the US-based on concern that they can no longer rely on US leadership or commitments? Moreover, to what extent and when do US adversaries try to take advantage of weaknesses of US foreign policy caused by domestic polarization? More broadly, to what extent is increased domestic polarization contributing to changes in the formal and informal architecture of the international order? These may be among the most important and fruitful avenues for new research and they are particularly relevant against the background of established insights that democracies are reliable cooperation partners and formidable in military warfare (Lake 1992; Bueno de Mesquita et al. 1999; Doyle 2005) .",

            "text": "Finally, it would be worthwhile for scholars of foreign policy to build more connections between research on US polarization and work on polarization in other political contexts. To a large extent, scholarship on the politics of US foreign policy has been conducted in isolation from scholarship on the politics of foreign policy in other countries (cf. Somer & McCoy 2018; Carothers 2019) . But some recent work highlights important commonalities in party politics on foreign policy across contemporary democracies, underscoring the value of integrating knowledge about the US case with knowledge about other cases (Wagner et al. 2017; Oktay 2018; Haesebrouck and Mello 2020; Raunio and Wagner 2020; Wagner 2020 ; see also Beasley et al. 2013) . While some characteristics of American politics, such as its two-party system, presidential democracy, electoral college system, and tradition of exceptionalism, mean that neither polarization dynamics nor the content of foreign policy will ever be identical in the US and other democracies, we should strive to enhance our understanding of similarities and differences in the extent, drivers, and effects of polarization in countries across the globe.",
