In this context, global vaccination campaigns of companion animals, as well as wildlife reservoirs vaccination, are key factors to achieve the \"Zero by 30\" plan that pursues the eradication of dog-mediated human rabies by 2030. Rabies virus-neutralizing antibodies (VNAs) play an essential role in the disease protection, as it correlates with an adequate immune response and allows evaluating pre-or post-exposure prophylaxis efficacy. Hence, counting with reliable, accurate, and robust serological tests is of paramount importance. Currently, RFFIT and FAVN are the gold standard VNAs tests recommended by both the WHO and the OIE. Despite these methodologies are efficient and widely used, they present several drawbacks, as they are less easily to standardize and require the use of live rabies virus, containment facilities, and skilled professionals. Thus, in this review, we describe the state-of-the-art of alternative analytical methodologies currently available for rabies serology, with novel approaches based on pseudotyped recombinant viruses and emphasizing in the antigen binding methodologies that detect and quantify antibodies against the rabies glycoprotein. We discussed the wide range of assays that are interesting tools for a faster measurement of anti-rabies glycoprotein antibodies and, in some cases, less complex and more versatile than the gold standard methods. Finally, we discussed the key issues during the design and optimization steps of ELISA assays, highlighting the importance of validation and standardization procedures to improve rabies serology tests and, as a consequence, their results.",

However, while rabies is fatal once symptoms appear, it is preventable due to the relatively long incubation period between virus entry and development of clinical disease (Johnson et al. 2010; Ives et al. 2019) .

            "text": "Virus neutralization assays (VNAs) are cell-based or in vivo assays that detect the functional activity of Abs in the serum, plasma, or cerebrospinal fluid against live virus. The first assay developed to quantify rabies VNAs was the mouse neutralization test (MNT) (Webster and Dawson 1935) , an in vivo assay where mice are intracerebrally inoculated with active RABV, previously incubated with diluted serum samples. The level of VNAs in the sample is evidenced by the survival of inoculated animals, where a higher percentage of survival is related to a higher VNAs titer. Because of the technical complexity, the difficulty to standardize the assay involving the use of live animals, and the growing tendency to substitute the animal use (3 R principle), it has been replaced in many laboratories around the world with some exceptions in developing countries (World Health Organization 2018). To date, only two rabies VNAs tests are considered as the gold standard methods for rabies serology and recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE): the RFFIT (rapid fluorescent focus inhibition test) (Smith et al. 1973 ) and the FAVN (fluorescent antibody virus neutralization) test (Cliquet et al. 1998 ). These methods were designed to mimic the in vivo assay, using BHK-21 cells, which are highly susceptible to RABV infection (Fig. 2) . Result interpretation is the main difference between both assays: in the former, the number of infected focus per serum dilution is used to calculate the ED 50 (50% effective dose) neutralization titer and converted to IU/mL if a reference standard is included in the assay (World Health Organization 2018) ( Fig. 2A) , whereas the latter is an \"all or nothing\" approach. Here, BHK-21 cells are cultured on 96-well plates instead of the 8-well chambers used on RFFIT assay; thereafter, each well is marked as positive or negative depending on the presence of infected cells on it, thereby increasing the accuracy and the quality of the test results (World Health Organization 2018) (Fig. 2B) . These VNAs tests exhibit several drawbacks, as they are less easily standardized and require the use of live RABV, containment facilities, and skilled professionals, among others. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative techniques to assess rabies control and surveillance.",

            "text": "Alternative for the measurement of VNAs: pseudotyped neutralization assays In the last decades, recombinant viral vectors pseudotyped with a heterologous glycoprotein have been widely used for the establishment of safe and versatile serology tests. Using these vectors for the detection of VNAs (in vitro or in vivo), multiple strains or genotypes of viruses can be evaluated in a safer way. The recombinant vectors are normally produced by transient transfection methods, and the obtained viral particles are not replicative; thus, lower biohazard practices are needed (Ferrara and Temperton 2018) . Lentiviruses are the most common recombinant vectors used for this purpose, being applied for a variety of enveloped viruses such as Ebola, MERS, Hepatitis C, influenza, and, more recently, for SARS-CoV-2. The envelope protein, the core and its genome, containing a reporter, is the backbone of the pseudotyped system. Several reporters are employed in the pseudotyped system being the fluorescent proteins (more often GFP) and luciferase the most commonly used reporter, due to its higher sensitivity and versatility, enabling high-throughput screening. Thereafter, the signal is measured using a fluorescent microscope or a flow cytometer for the former and a luminometer for the latter, where a cell lysis step prior to acquisition is necessary (Temperton et al. 2005; Fontana et al. 2015; Nie et al. 2017; Crawford et al. 2020; Nie et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020) (Fig.  3 ). To guarantee comparable results among assays, titers should be reported as median tissue culture infection dose (TCID50). Besides, it is important to established the producer cell line (more often HEK293T), the transfection method (chemical or physical), culture conditions, and the harvest time, to standardize the LV production protocol assessing consistent LV titers and as a consequence, consistence, accurate, and reproducibly results.",

There are several types of ELISA used in serological methods, which vary in the antigen-antibody detection format. Besides, there are several detection systems, as biotin-avidin system conjugated to HRP, a secondary antibody conjugated to HRP, or a bacterial protein A/G conjugated to HRP that recognize the Fc portion of the Igs.

The detection systems usually involve a secondary antibody conjugated to the HRP enzyme. This secondary antibody can be species specific which may limit the assay versatility (Cliquet et al. 2000; Cliquet et al. 2003; Zhao et al. 2019) , Igs specific (more often anti-IgM or anti-IgG) (Zajac 2019), or recognizing the Fc portion of the Abs, as the protein A/G system conjugated to HRP is employed (De Toledo Piza et al. 1999; Cliquet et al. 2004; Feyssaguet et al. 2007 ). The main advantage of the latter detection system is that the method can be applied to samples of different species. However, the protein A/G does not bind with the same affinity to all Igs subtypes, and it also varies between species; indeed, it is known that protein A binds preferentially to IgM or IgG, but not to IgG3 subclass (Bergmann-Leitner et al. 2008) . Hence, there could be some variations in the Abs quantitation (or detection) depending on the sample (type, timing, species); thus, special care in this kind of assay must be taken, mainly during the assay result interpretation. On the other hand, if the aim of the study is to determine the proportion of IgG/IgM in the course of rabies infection or after rabies vaccination, the detection system employing anti-IgM and anti-IgG is highly desirable. However, if the goal is to develop a good estimator of VNAs, the latter system is not the best, as it has been established that only IgGs can neutralize and protect against RABV infection. The function of IgM may be limited due to its pentameric structure, preventing the tissue penetration of IgM (Katz et al. 2017) .",

            "text": "Two commercial iELISA assays are based on HRPconjugated protein A, the SERELISA\u00ae (Rabies Ab Mono Indirect) and PLATELIA\u00ae II Rabies kit (Bio-Rad). There are several reports that compared their results with the ones of VNAs assays. The SERELISA\u00ae test was described by the OIE as a screening tool to control rabies Abs in vaccinated dogs and cats, but due to the lack of sensitivity, all negative results must be confirmed in a VNAs test (Cliquet et al. 2004 ). Further collaborative studies demonstrated a high rate of false positive results in several laboratories (Servat and Cliquet 2006; Wasniewski et al. 2016) . Regarding the PLATELIA\u00ae Rabies II kit (certified by the OIE), Feyysaguet et al described this test as a qualitative and semi-quantitative format, which exhibited a good correlation with RFFIT test for vaccinated and unvaccinated human serum sample ). Besides, Welch et al. (2009) described good correlation between PLATELIA\u00ae and RFFIT assay in human sera samples and better than those obtained when compared to an alternative indirect ELISA kit, DGR Rabies Virus IgG Ab ELISA (DRG International), with the RFFIT (Welch et al. 2009 ). Moreover, the evaluation of the PLATELIA\u00ae II (ad usum veterinarium) for PEP of domestic and wildlife carnivores revealed different results between studies. Servat et al. established a threshold value of 0.5 EU/mL (harmonized with the 0.5 IU/mL) and validated these assays, obtaining good correlation with the FAVN test (Servat et al. 2007 ). By the contrary, a large-scale study on pet domestic carnivores' samples significantly differed with the previously mentioned study, establishing a new cut-off value of 0.3 EU/mL to maintain the assay sensitivity but with a reduction in its specificity. These variations between studies could be due to certain (2). Thereafter, a known amount of lentiviral particles are pre-incubated with diluted serum samples (3). Later, the mix is added to a target cell culture and incubated for 48 h (4). Finally, the GFP signal is measured by flow cytometry (5) Thi Nguyen et al. (2015) modifications during the manufacturing process of the kit (Wasniewski et al. 2014) . Competitive ELISA (cELISA) consists in fixing the Ag to the solid phase, and the Abs present in the sample compete with an enzyme-labeled Ab for binding to the Ag. Thus, in this assay, the higher the signal, the lesser the concentration of Ab in the test sample (Zhang et al. 2009 ). Another alternative of this format is the one described by Korimbocus et al. for potency testing of equine anti-rabies sera, employing the Mab D1 clone that recognize one of the immunodominant epitopes of the rabies glycoprotein involves in the induction of VNAs (site III) (Jallet et al. 1999) , demonstrating a good correlation with MNT assay (Korimbocus et al. 2016) . They also evaluated human anti-rabies Igs, obtaining higher and more heterogeneous titers in comparison with PLATELIA\u00ae Rabies II and RFFIT.",

Besides, BioPro ELISA was further validated throughout an international study involving serum samples from foxes and raccoon dogs vaccinated with different vaccine strains available in Europe (Wasniewski et al. 2016) .

Furthermore, indirect fluorescent antibody test is also a semi-quantitative test for rabies immunoglobulins detection where the presence of rabies Igs is assessed by a fluorescence signal, requiring as little as 1.5 h to obtain the result. However, a fluorescence microscope is needed (Messenger and Rupprecht 2015) .

In this context, despite ELISAs sometimes fail in the accurate estimation of the potential acquired immunity after infection or vaccination, as functional and non-functional Abs are measured, several others have proven a good correlation with the gold standard assays. Besides, we must not deny all the inherent characteristics of this technique that are a benefit in comparison with gold standard assays: safer, not requiring (in general) virus manipulation, versatility, high-throughput, high consistent results, less time, and associated cost. Finally, another point to consider is that ELISAs are flexible techniques, easily adaptable to laboratories of low-level complexity, making it a particularly interesting candidate in developing countries where rabies is endemic.

Generally, fluorescence techniques exhibit a higher sensitivity than colorimetric assay, requiring less amount of the test sample.

Here, specialized knowledge and experience, together with data from literature, will facilitate the task. The coated-antigen characteristics are probably one of the most crucial steps in the ELISA assay together with the amount and type of capture/detection Abs. For instance, the use of rabies G protein as the coating Ag is more relevant when assessing the oral vaccination efficacy than the whole virus, as VNAs are primarily directed against the glycoprotein. Thus, it will be better to use the glycoprotein as the coated Ag. Besides, the degree of purity of the coated-Ag may influence the assay selectivity. It has been shown that purified Ag provides higher homogeneity, lesser interfering substances, and a better evaluation of VNAs (Zhao et al. 2019 ). However, it has also been reported that the Ag purification protocols may affect the immunogenicity of the rabies G protein (Wasniewski and Cliquet 2011; Wasniewski et al. 2013) .",

In our previous work (Fontana et al. 2020) , an optimization multivariate strategy was followed which allowed us to identify the purified RV-VLPs and the rabies glycoprotein monoclonal antibody (mAb AB5) as the key components of this assay. In the RV-VLPs, the rabies G is presented in high density in the surface of the particles in its trimeric form (Fontana et al. 2015) . Besides, the selected detection system (streptavidin-peroxidase) influences the assay sensitivity, so it was selected as an additional variable to be optimized.

The goal of an assay validation is to provide assurance that the method is likely to produce results that are fit-for-purpose. Hence, we must differentiate between the aim of a qualitative and a quantitative ELISA assay. The aim of the former is to assess if the analyte (in this case, rabies Igs) is present or not in the test sample and which is the minimum level of detection (cut-off). By the contrary, in the latter assay, a limit of quantitation (LOQ) must be established, and the amount of the analyte in the test sample is determined by comparing with the reference standard's response. The validation procedure of the test will be not the same if it is a qualitative or a quantitative assay. Indeed, the extent of the validation procedure depends on the status of the assay, and it is determined by the customer needs or as laid down on regulations. For qualitative methods, it is essential to determine the sensitivity (or its inverse false negative rate) and specificity (or its inverse false positive rate) through a ROC curve, finding the optimal cut-off value with a broad spectrum of test samples and avoiding bias (Hajian-Tilaki 2013) . In these types of assays, establishing the cut-off value is critical. That is, in part, because the higher the threshold value, the lesser the false positive rate and, thus, a truly guarantee of seroconversion, whereas for quantitative assay, the sensitivity, analytical sensitivity, linearity, limit of detection, LOQ, selectivity, robustness, accuracy, and precision (at least repeatability and intermediate precision) must be evaluated. In addition, the stability is also important. The use of a serum reference standard with known stability is also essential. If a collaboration study is performed, the assay's reproducibility can be determined to standardize the procedure.",

In this context, serology is a critical component for rabies surveillance and prevention programs to mitigate its risk in human beings and in domestic and wildlife animals. Currently, RFFIT and FAVN are still being the gold standard VNAs assays for rabies serology test. However, different assays employing pseudotyped recombinant viruses represent a promising and safer alternative to the conventional methods, characterized by a good reproducibility and sensitivity performance. On the other hand, ELISA and other Ag binding assays are considered acceptable for anti-rabies Abs detection, exhibiting greater assurance of consistent results and less time consuming than VNAs tests.
