            "text": "Introduction The assistant in medicine is a new and paid role for final-year medical students that has been established in New South Wales, Australia, as part of the surge workforce management response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Eligibility requires the applicant to be a finalyear medical student in an Australian Medical Councilaccredited university and registered with the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency. While there are roles with some similarities to the assistant in medicine role, such as assistantships (the UK) and physician assistants adopted internationally, this is completely new in Australia. Little is known about the functionality and success factors of this role within the health practitioner landscape, particularly within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the complexity of this role, a realist approach to evaluation has been undertaken as described in this protocol, which sets out a study design spanning from August 2020 to June 2021. Methods and analysis The intention of conducting a realist review is to identify the circumstances and mechanisms that determine the outcomes of the assistant in medicine intervention. We will start by developing an initial programme theory to explore the potential function of the assistant in medicine role through realist syntheses of critically appraised summaries of existing literature using relevant databases and journals. Other data sources such as interviews and surveys with key stakeholders will contribute to the refinements of the programme theory. Using this method, we will develop a set of hypotheses on how and why the Australian assistants in medicine intervention might 'work' to achieve a variety of outcomes based on examples of related international interventions. These hypotheses will be tested against the qualitative and quantitative evidence gathered from all relevant stakeholders. Ethics and dissemination Ethics approval for the larger study was obtained from the Western Sydney Local Health District (2020/ETH01745). The findings of this review will provide useful information for hospital managers, academics and policymakers, who can apply the findings in their context when deciding how to implement and support the introduction of assistants in medicine into the health system. We will publish our findings in reports to policymakers, peer-reviewed journals and international conferences.",

            "text": "New South Wales (NSW) State Ministry of Health, the largest health system in Australia, reviewed its workforce capacity in anticipation of a COVID-19 surge. As a result, a new assistant in medicine role has been created to work within non-COVID-19 multidisciplinary teams to provide extra medical assistance should junior medical officers be redeployed. These roles have been filled by final-year medical students. These students volunteered via their medical school, which reviewed their progress and certified them as having appropriate knowledge and skills. The assistant in medicine role is officially paid, workplace employment, rather than a clinical placement. Despite students being able to express an interest in a particular placement, this role has been designed so that it aligns with local health district service needs rather than with the students' potential career interests. The role is part-time and based on a temporary contract extending to a maximum of 6 months at 32 hours per week, with variation across different local health districts, which equates to approximately 3-4 shifts per week at the most. The assistants in medicine Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba A realist evaluation design is able to provide a deeper level of understanding as to how an intervention in complex situation works by assessing the interaction of the underlying causal factors through an investigation of the context, mechanisms and outcomes. \u25ba The ongoing and iterative nature of the realist syntheses and evaluation allows for complex interpretation of the programme theory and the development of middle-range theories. \u25ba The survey will be sent to 55 assistant in medicine participants at the end of the programme, which may prove problematic in terms of data analysis.",

            "text": "Medical students' assistantships Assistantships in the UK are medical students who, via a longitudinal full-time placement, are integrated into a healthcare team for the last few months of their clinical training to gain phased-in hands-on experience carrying out the work of a newly qualified doctor under appropriate supervision. 2-5 21 Thus, the timing of assistantships is the same as the assistants in medicine. Similar to assistants in medicine, assistantships differ in length from 3 to 6 months, and they can be undertaken in the hospital where students will eventually be appointed. 5 6 However, unlike assistants in medicine, some assistantships are aligned with the exact role to which they are about to transition. 5 6 The purpose of this assistantship role is to smooth the transition from being a student to being a professional, 22 hopefully easing their passage into a professional role by gradually preparing them for the responsibilities they will face as a junior doctor. 2 23 24 This purpose is only partly aligned with that of the assistants in medicine, as their key purpose was to provide assistance should junior medical officers be otherwise deployed (so they are there to fill a service gap due to the pandemicrelated demands). This assistantship role is not without its challenges. Some students report struggling to participate effectively due to a lack of clarity about the nature of their role. Consequently, students narrate becoming passive, preventing open participation, active learning and the development of professional identity as a junior doctor. 2 This, it is suggested, can compound student stress and clinical risk, and hamper meaningful appraisal of their professional development. 2 24 As a result, the development of a sense of belonging and feeling like a doctor (ie, their professional identity) may be delayed due to the lack of meaningful participation in professional activities. 2 Students who report being supported narrated their experiences in a markedly different manner to those who did not. Indeed, this support eased students' transition into their professional role, feeling it to be 'business as usual' due to their existing understanding of requirements and work practices for an F1 (Post Graduate Year 1(PGY1)). 24 As Crossley and Vivekananda-Schmidt state, 'the gap then between student and doctor is quite clear. It is participation in healthcare delivery with a real purpose'. 2 Indeed, responsibility and participation in professional activities appear to be crucial for furnishing students with confidence, resilience and proactive behaviours in professional practice and reinforcing aspects of personal development also delivered in the university curriculum. 24 Key aspects of the assistantship programme appear to be the quality of supervision provided to students in this role 3 25 and the extent to which they are accepted and mentored into multidisciplinary teams. 2 The unpaid assistantship differs from the assistant in medicine role in that it is a full-time student role with the main intention of gradually integrating students into practice as paid employees, while the assistant in medicine is a part-time role that was intended to act as a fully functioning team member. They are similar to each other in that both roles are held by final-year medical students at the end of their degree, and there is an element of transition smoothing with both.",

            "text": "The role of physician assistant or physician associate was introduced in the USA in 1965 and then developed internationally (eg, in countries such as Australia, Canada, England, the Netherlands, Scotland, South Africa and Taiwan). In Australia, this role was proposed to meet the demand for medical services following a drive for a healthier society through the introduction of Medicare; however, it wasn't implemented. 18 Physician assistant/ associates are usually able to undertake routine technical tasks and so relieve the load of the physician. 26 However, physician associates are less qualified than a physician and unable to work independently. 18 A number of impediments restricting the use of physician assistant/Associates have been identified including legal issues, training programmes, lack of medical school attendance and unclear role relationships. 7 However, it has been found that the physician assistant/associate role can reduce pressure on struggling health systems and successfully fill a much-needed gap in healthcare. In addition, where these roles are deployed, patient feedback is largely favourable, and there is reportedly an increase of team flexibility, continuity of care and smooth patient flow. 9 14 Physician assistant/associates offer the capacity to fill roles currently filled by medical staff, thus saving on resources, 16 and provide opportunities for doctors to spend time on more complex patients and to attend to patients in clinic and theatre settings. 14 15 Physician assistant/associates are found to be valued for their generalism, health background, confidence in differential diagnoses and communication. Furthermore, the presence of physician assistant/associates can enhance postgraduate medical education through filling in for junior doctors and releasing them from duties. 12 13 However, doctors are concerned about the reduction of medical education opportunities for junior doctors caused by this role as attention is diverted to the training of new physician assistant/associates, which is not generally supported in practice.",

For example, in the UK, junior doctors voted to 'actively oppose' the medical associate professionals (MAPs) to being treated equally to them in relation to medical staffing. MAPs include physician associates and advanced critical care practitioners. 11 Issues associated with the role are based around regulation, registration, autonomy and a lack of understanding or knowledge about the role. 9 15 17 19 20 Ignorance about the physician assistant/associate role can cause problems for physician assistant/associates with regard to identity formation and identity dissonance, 8 and there are issues around managing the expectations of the role by both those training to be physician assistant/associates and healthcare staff. 10 Lastly, lack of options for physician assistant/ associates can impact career advancement, and there is a propensity for burnout. 19 While both the physician assistant/associate and assistant in medicine roles are paid positions and both filling a service gap, there are differences between the roles. For example, the physician assistant/associate is full time and does not include integrated study time, and the role will not lead to the position of a physician or open a career pathway to further progression or result in autonomy of practice. Second, the former have graduated from their medical programme, whereas the assistant in medicine has not graduated with some assistants in medicine having more curriculum and assessment to undertake. Furthermore, physician assistant/associates are interdependent, semiautonomous clinicians practising in partnership with physicians, whereas assistants in medicine work under clinicians' supervision. The tasks that each assistant in medicine student is allowed to do are expected to vary according to the hospital and team they are allocated to.",

For example, a significant factor in the quality of the experience of an assistant in medicine is the appropriate delegation of substantial or significant responsibility to them, thereby integrating them into the team. Where this has occurred under appropriate supervision, the assistants in medicine experienced a higher level of professional development and preparedness. This requires an understanding of this role within the hospital system and how it can be effectively used. By comparison, the role of physician assistant has been hampered by a lack of a clear job description 20 and ability to act with authority, leading to calls for regulation and registration within a new association. 17 19 20 Confusion about these roles can severely impact on the formation of professional identity leading to identity dissonance. 2 8 Step 2: search for evidence Table 1 clarifies our inclusion and exclusion criteria for the literature search. Using these criteria, we will work with a university-based librarian to develop an appropriate search strategy to locate articles pertinent to the roles of assistantships in medicine, physician assistants and physician associates (box 1 is an example of this). Note that we include the term 'pandemic' in our search strategy as the assistant in medicine role was implemented in response to the pandemic. The rationale is to see if any other similar roles have been developed or any equivalent use of senior medical students, during the pandemic, and how they are being used. As the search develops, we will continue to iteratively monitor and assess our search terms, introducing new terms as required. An additional search of grey literature will commence if deemed appropriate, in which we will review documentation that contains policy, procedures and curriculum reports alongside any other literature that may come within the scope of the study.",
