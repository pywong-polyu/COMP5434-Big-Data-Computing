We consider the temporal changes from financial correlations using network filtering methods. These methods consider a subset of links within the correlation matrix, which gives rise to a network structure. We use sovereign bond yield data from 17 European countries between the 2010 and 2020 period as an indicator of the economic health of countries. We find that the average correlation between sovereign bonds within the COVID-19 period decreases, from the peak observed in the 2019-2020 period, where this trend is also reflected in all network filtering methods. We also find variations between the movements of different network filtering methods under various network measures.",

            "text": "The novel coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 began in China in December 2019 and rapidly spread around the world. The confirmed cases increased in different cities of China, Japan, and South Korea in a few days of early January 2020, but spread globally with new cases in Iran, Spain, and Italy within the middle of February. We focus on sovereign bonds during the COVID-19 period to highlight the extent to which the pandemic has influenced the financial markets. In the last few years, bond yields across the Euro-zone were decreasing under a range of European Central Bank (ECB) interventions, and overall remained stable compared with the German Bund, a benchmark used for European sovereign bonds. These movements were disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the future trajectory of bond yields from highly impacted countries, e.g., Spain and Italy. However, in the last months, the European central banks intervened in financial and monetary markets to consolidate stability through an adequate supply of liquidity countering the possible margin calls and the risks of different markets and payment systems. These interventions played a specific role in sovereign bonds because, on the one side, supported the stability of financial markets and, on the other side, supported the governments' financial stability and developed a global reference interest rate scheme. Understanding how correlations now differ and similarities observed in previous financial events are important in dealing with the future economic effects of COVID- 19. We consider an analysis of sovereign bonds by using network filtering methods, which is part of a growing literature within the area of econophysics [29, 44, 30, 28, 17] . The advantages in using filtering methods is the extraction of a network type structure from the financial correlations between sovereign bonds, which allows the properties of centrality and clustering to be considered. In consequence, the correlation-based networks and hierarchical clustering methodologies allow us to understand the nature of financial markets and some features of sovereign bonds. It is not clear which approach should be used in analyzing sovereign bond yields, and so within this paper, we implement various filtering methods to the sovereign bond yield data and compare the resulting structure of different networks.",

These dynamics are reflected across all network filtering methods and represent the wide impact of COVID-19 towards the spectrum of correlations, compared to previous financial events. We consider the network centrality of sovereign bonds within the COVID-19 period, which remains consistent with previous years. These trends are distinctive between filtering methods and stem from the nature of correlations towards economic factors e.g., positive correlations show a stable trend in the individual centrality, compared with the volatile trends for negative correlations, where central nodes within these networks are less integrated in the Euro-area. Although there is a change in the magnitude of correlations, the overall structure relative to the central node is maintained within the COVID-19 period.",

Several authors have used network filtering methods to explain financial structures [31, 37] , hierarchy and networks in financial markets [50] , relations between financial markets and real economy [34] , volatility [51] , interest rates [33] , stock markets [21, 52, 53, 2] , future markets [8] or topological dynamics [45] to list a few. Also, the comparison of filtering methods to market data has been used for financial instruments. Birch, et al [10] consider a comparison of filtering methods of the DAX30 stocks. Musmeci, et al [35] propose a multiplex visual network approach and consider data of multiple stock indexes. Kukreti, et al [26] use the S&P500 market data and incorporate entropy measures with a range of network filtering methods. Aste, et al [5] apply a comparison of network filtering methods on the US equity market data and assess the dynamics using network measures.",

The algorithm initially chooses a clique of 4 nodes, where edges are then added sequentially, in order to optimize the objective function e.g., the total edge weight of the network, until all nodes are connected. This approach is non-greedy in choosing edges and incorporates the formation of cliques within the network structure.

The MaST has the highest variation, with a centralized network structure in some periods e.g., C(t) of 16, forming a star shaped network structure. This is usually associated with Greece, Iceland and Hungary, which are identified as the central node 55% of the time. The degree centrality on average is naturally highest with the TMFG, under a higher network density, where the central nodes are identified as Hungary and Romania sovereign bonds, similar to the MaST. The AG identifies the Netherlands and Belgium within the degree centrality, under a higher proportion of 25% and 13% compared with the MST. Within Figure 3 , the MOL on average is smallest for the AG, because of the 0 level values from unconnected nodes, in which an unconnected node is present within 94% of considered windows. We find that the nodes within the TMFG are closest within the network, where the central node is directly or indirectly connected for all nodes, with an average path length of 1.1 across all periods.

The UK remains within the periphery of the MaST structure when considering anti-correlations, and shows UK bond yields fluctuate less with movements of other European bonds compared with previous years. This is also observed for sovereign bonds for other countries with non-Euro currencies such as Czech Republic, Hungary, and Iceland. We find nodes within the TMFG to have the highest degree in Iceland at 13 and Poland at 10. Although the MST is embedded within the TMFG network structure, a high resemblance is observed to links from the MaST, where 69% of links which are present within the MaST are common in both networks. There is also the associated degree centrality of the MaST, which is observed within the TMFG connected nodes. Under the TMFG, nodes have a higher degree connectivity when considering an increased number of links, this is the case for the UK, which has 9 links compared with other spanning tree approaches. The AG exhibits three connected components between western European countries, southern European countries and the UK with eastern European countries. These unconnected nodes within the AG are associated with non-Euro adopting countries, with the remaining countries connected in an individual component. By solely considering the most positive correlations, we observe the formation of 3-cliques between countries, which is prevalent within the western European group of 6 nodes.",

The rate interest policy of the European Central Bank helped to consolidate the trust in this kind of asset; the bonds confirmed their adjustment especially Germany, France, Spain, during the fourth quarter of 2013, while countries like Greece and Italy started in 2014 with variations of over 500 basis points during the following months. By 2015, all European bonds increased their yields as a result of an adjustment of the market rally of 2014. We analyze the sovereign bond yield data for the following countries Austria (AUT), Belgium (BEL), Czech Republic (CZE), France (FRA), Germany (DEU), Greece (GRC), Hungary (HUN), Iceland (ISL), Ireland (IRL), Italy (ITA), Netherlands (NLD), Poland (POL), Portugal (PRT), Romania (ROU), Spain (ESP), Switzerland (CHE), and the UK (GBR). Out of 17 European countries, seven countries are outside the Euro-zone (Czech Republic, Hungary, Iceland, Poland, Romania, Switzerland, and the UK) and three are not within the EU (Iceland, Switzerland, and the UK)",
