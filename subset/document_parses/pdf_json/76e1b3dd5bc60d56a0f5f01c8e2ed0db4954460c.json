Quick and precise detection of the deadly virus is essential for facilitating early intervention and treatment, and hence reduces mortality of the disease [2] . Reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR)-based assays have been developed and used as the standard tests for detecting RNA sequences of SARS-CoV-2 [3] . However, the RT-PCR techniques are complex, expensive, time-consuming, and suited to centralized diagnostic laboratories. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a point of care (POC) test for rapid and sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) are a family of DNA sequences found within the genomes of prokaryotic organisms [4] . The CRISPRassociated (Cas) immune system has been applied in molecular biology to target and cleave specific nucleic acid sequences, which are commonly used in gene editing. Recently, several Cas proteins have been shown to activate and unleash nonspecific endoribonuclease activity to cause cleavage of DNA or RNA, and thus provide a novel diagnostic approach for nuclei acid detection [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . For instance, using Cas12a, Chen et al. developed a method termed DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR) for nucleic acid detection [7] . We recently demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas12a could detect nucleic Biomedicines 2021, 9, 239 2 of 11 acids of exogenous viruses, such as human papillomavirus, in raw plasma of cervical cancer patients without requiring RNA extraction [10] . Much like a pregnancy test, this CRISPR-Cas12a-POC is a paper-strip test and can \"display results immediately\" [10] . We have also demonstrated that the CRISPR-based test can rapidly and sensitively detect endogenous DNA mutations of EGFR and KRAS in plasma and tissue specimens of lung cancer patients [11, 12] . Broughton et al. used DETECTR to detect SARS-CoV-2 in RNA extracted from clinical specimens [13] . Furthermore, combining CRISPR-Cas13a with mobile phone microscopy, Fozouni et al. develop a rapid assay for testing SARS-CoV-2 from nasal swab RNA. Ding et al. developed the All-In-One Dual CRISPR-Cas12a (AIOD-CRISPR) assay for one-pot and visual SARS-CoV-2 detection [14] . In addition, Young et al. developed a CRISPR-Cas12b-based test called SHERLOCK Testing in One Pot (STOP) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 [15] . However, the current CRISPR techniques for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 require isolating RNA from specimens, which complicates the procedures and increases the risk of cross-contaminations and transmissions of the virus. In this study, we aimed to develop CRISPR-Cas12a as POC testing for sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 by directly targeting specimens without RNA isolation and immediately reading results.",

CRISPR has been investigated to develop tests for detection of SARS-CoV-2 [13] [14] [15] . However, these CRISPR-based techniques require RNA extraction from specimens, which complicates the procedures and produces contaminations and inconstant results [13, 14] . To address the obstacles, herein we combine CRISPR-Cas12a with RT-RPA to directly analyze lysed samples and immediately visualize results using a UV light illuminator or paper strips for detection of SARS-CoV-2. This new CRISPR-Cas12a assay has the following advantages: (1) It can directly target samples for detecting SARS-CoV-2 without requiring the complicated procedures (RNA extraction). The whole process of the test takes about 60 min. (2) The test takes place at a constant temperature of 42 \u2022 C, and thus could act as a real one-step detection of SARS-CoV-2 and enable POC testing. (3) The test has at least the same sensitivity as does the standard RT-PCR in genomic RNA of cells infected with the virus, and therefore, might provide a sensitive POC tool for detection of SARS-CoV-2. (4) The clinical significance of the CRISPR-Cas12a assay was confirmed in nasopharyngeal swab specimens of COVID-19 patients and healthy individuals.",
