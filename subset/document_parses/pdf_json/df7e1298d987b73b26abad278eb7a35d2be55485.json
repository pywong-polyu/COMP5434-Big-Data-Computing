            "text": "A dynamic principal component analysis is proposed to monitor the stability, and detect any atypical behavior, of the Brunelleschi's Dome of Santa Maria del Fiore, in Florence. First cracks in the Dome appeared at the end of the 15th century and nowadays they are present in all the Dome's webs, although with an heterogenous distribution. A monitoring system has been installed in the Dome since 1955 to monitor the behavior of the cracks; today, it counts more than 160 instruments, such as mechanical and electronic deformometers, thermometers, piezometers. The analyses carried out to date show slight increases in the size of the main cracks and, at the same time, a clear relationship with some environmental variables. However, due to the extension of the monitoring system and the complexity of collected data, to our knowledge an analysis involving all the detected variables has not yet conducted. In this contribution, we aim at finding simplified structures (i.e., latent common factors or principal components) that summarize the measurements coming from the different instruments and explain the overall behavior of the Dome across the time. We found that the overall behavior of the Dome tracked by multiple sensors may be satisfactorily summarized with a single principal component, which shows a sinusoidal time trend characterized, in a one-year period, by an expansive phase followed by a contractive phase. We also found that some webs contribute more than others to the Dome's movements.",

With more than 4 millions bricks, Brunelleschi's Dome was the greatest architectural feat in the Western world (because the Brunelleschi's idea was to build an octagonal dome higher and wider than any that had ever been built). It is characterized by eight webs resting on an octagonal supporting tambour and converging to the lantern that crown its top. First cracks in some webs appeared at the end of the 15th century. The evolving of the issue gave rise of concern and already in 1695 the Grand Duke of Tuscany established a first commission with the task to investigate the stability of the Dome. Nowadays, cracks are present in all webs, although particularly numerous in the even ones, mainly in webs 4 and 6 that are located on the opposite sides of the nave (Fig. 1) . The monitoring system, installed in the Dome since 1955, today counts more than 160 sensors (mechanical and electronic deformometers, thermometers, piezometers, . . . ). Due to the variety and number of instruments involved, this monitoring system is one of the most accurate static control systems around the world installed on an historical building. The extension of the monitoring system and the amount of data collected by each sensor make it very difficult to obtain an overall evaluation of the static evolution of the Dome. However, the analysis carried out on data collected by single sensors applied upon the main cracks have allowed to highlight a constant pejorative increase in width over time, and a clear relationship with the main (exogenous) environmental (meteorological and seismic related) variables involved [5] .",

The imputation process will be propedeutic to the estimation of a dynamic principal components model whose results will be presented and discussed in Sect. 3.

The variations of temperature between night and day within the 24 h are considered irrelevant because the masonry is not able to react instantly to changes in air temperature, especially those within a day; thus, a very slight variation range is expected for the daily detections produced by each deformometer. Under these assumptions, arithmetic mean does not present drawbacks and has the advantage to solve any cases in which daily measurements, for temporary faults, are less than 4. Figure 3 shows data from the deformometers installed in the even webs. The figure clarifies what is commonly referred as the \"breathing\" mechanism of the Dome in time: the cracks tend to expand and shrink cyclically according to seasons. This behavior is due to the structure of the Dome that may be assimilated to a physic \"closed system\", where the structural constraints define the relationship of forces between the various cracks, which in turn are subjected to the action of meteorological and other environmental variables [3] .",

On clean data, a five-parameters quadratic-sinusoidal regression model was fitted for each type of sensor (air thermometers, masonry thermometers, and deformometers) imposing a sine of period equal to the length of one year, to take into account both the seasonal fluctuation of the measurements or the possible variations produced by systematic changes in the structural framework.

In turn, the complete series of air thermometers was used to impute missing data in the time series of the masonry thermometers. Finally, the complete series of masonry thermometers of each web were used to predict missing values of the deformometers installed in that web. In particular, for each air thermometer, the week of the year to which data refers to, the minimum, average and maximum daily temperature recorded in the city and the values estimated by the respective quadratic-sinusoidal regression model were provided as covariates (explicative variables) of the model used to impute missing values present in the corresponding series. For each masonry thermometer series, missing values have been imputed using the following covariates: the week of the year to which data refers to, the complete series of the air thermometers installed in the relative web and the estimations produced by the quadraticsinusoidal regression model applied on the masonry thermometer series that has to be imputed. Similarly, missing values in the deformometer series have been imputed using a regression model with covariates: the week of the year to which data refers to, the complete series of the masonry thermometers installed in the relative web and the estimations produced by the quadratic-sinusoidal regression model applied on the deformometer series that has to be imputed. For the sake of brevity, the results of the imputation process are presented only for some sensors. Figure 5 shows the result of the imputation process for the air thermometers TA7-03 installed on web 7: the imputation model shows an outstanding R-squared goodness of fit index (R 2 = 98.15%). Figure 6 shows the result of the imputation process for the masonry thermometers TM4-03 installed on web 4: the R-squared fitting index is excellent also in this case (R 2 = 98.48%). Figure 7 shows the result of the imputation process for the first three deformometers (DF2-01, DF2-02, DF2-03) installed on web 2. The fitting indices for those models were, respectively, 92,12%, 87,30% and 96,60%. The R-squared goodness of fit indices computed for all the deformometers that compose the ISMES monitoring system are reported in Table 1 . Almost all the indices show a very good performance of the relative model used to impute missing data. In very few cases, the fitting is unsatisfactory: these cases happen when the pattern of detections is quite inconsistent with the typical fluctuation of temperatures (i.e. when the sinusoidal regression model does not fit properly).",

The suitability of the approach was verified by limiting the analysis to the measurements acquired in the last year. [4, 10] and references therein). DFA models are closely related to GDPC models because they assume that one important part of the original series can be explained in a dynamic way by a relatively small number of common factors. However, while DFA relies on a series of assumptions regarding the distribution of error terms and on the variance-covariance matrices of the state-space equations, GDPC is more flexible because it only assumes that the time series share a common latent factor.",

The goodness of the reconstruction is evident, being the MSE of the reconstruction equal to 0.066. Indeed, the fitted model with one dynamic principal component with four lags, which represents the common factor underlying the time series of the 57 deformometers, explains the 93.4% of the whole variance in the dataset. The estimated time series of the common factor as well as the loadings for the 57 deformometers are displayed in Fig. 9 .",

Figure 9 , top left panel, shows the values of the first principal component along the time, suggesting that, during a one year period, the Dome has a sort of sinusoidal trend with a period of expansion, followed by a period of contraction. This is corroborated by the estimates of loading parameters \u03b2 jh (j = 1, . . . , m; h = 1, . . . , k + 1) that move together, alternating positive and negative values (Fig. 9 ). More in detail, measures of deformometers detected at 0, 2, and 4 lags (Fig. 9 , panels \"0 loading\", \"2 loading\", and \"4 loading\") contribute, with a few exceptions, to the expansive phase, whereas measures detected at 1 and 3 lags (Fig. 9 , panels \"1 loading\" and \"3 loading\") contribute to the contractive phase. Also, we notice that the highest loadings are due to cracks recorded by the deformometers in webs 4 (blue lines in Fig. 9 ) and 6 (pink and structural engineers) to globally evaluate the behavior of the Brunelleschi's Dome. In fact, this approach gave satisfactory results in financial applications (see [9] ) and its consistency has been investigated in [8] . For the future developments of the work, we intend to relate the movements of the webs each other as well as to assess the impact of external observable (exogenous) variables on the evolution of the cracks.",
