Previous studies showed that enabling non-expert users to program a cobot reduces the cost of robot maintenance and reprogramming. Since this approach is based on an interaction between the cobot and human partners, in this study, we investigate whether making this interaction more transparent can improve the interaction and lead to better performance for non-expert users. To evaluate the proposed methodology, an experiment with 67 participants is conducted. The obtained results show that providing explanation leads to higher performance, in terms of efficiency and efficacy, i.e., the number of times the task is completed without teaching a wrong instruction to the cobot is two times higher when explanations are provided. In addition, providing explanation also increases users' satisfaction and trust in working with the cobot.",

(2017) also characterized three other notions for it, i.e., opacity, comprehensibility, and interpretability, where interpretability implies model transparency. Interpretability can be influenced by different factors such as model's transparency and impacts different measurable outcomes, such as trust (Poursabzi-Sangdeh et al., 2018) . Thereby, among different notions of XAI, interpretability, and more precisely, transparency, is what we need to enable a cobot to explain its strategy for its human partner. To endow the proposed T-GUI with transparency (as its prime functionality), the knowledge that the cobot acquired during learning how to solve its task (Section 3) is used to produce human-understandable explanations, that explain and justify its actions.",

            "text": "A variety of models has been proposed in different studies to improve the collaboration between cobots and humans through transparency for different tasks, like cobot teaching and humancobot collaboration. For example, Chao et al. (2010) proposed a model to enable a robot to learn from a human teacher. Since the author believed the human teacher needs to know in which step the robot is to provide the most informative instructions for it, she proposed a transparent learning process in which the level of the robot's understanding can be determined in every step. To achieve this, the robot is able to express its uncertainty by related gestures. To evaluate the proposed model, a scenario is used in which users teach names of four symbolic objects to the robot, and later ask the robot whether it remembers these names. The robot is able to answer in five scales, i.e., certain-yes, uncertain-yes, uncertain, uncertain no, or certain-no. To show certain yes or no, it uses nodding and head-shaking, respectively, to show uncertain yes and no, it employs combinations of simultaneous head and body gestures, and for expressing uncertainty it utilizes shrugging. In this way, the human teacher can understand at which level the robot's understanding is. Although this model enables human teachers to understand whether the robot has learned the task or not, the reason why it did not learn yet is not provided. Additionally, the model does not allow the user to provide support in form of feedback to the robot when it made a mistake, instead the user has to teach the whole task again until the robot finally learns it. In contrast, the proposed model in this study enables the cobot to justify its actions by explaining the reason it is applying them, and the human teacher can directly provide missing instructions to enable the cobot to learn how to continue its task to accomplish it correctly, which speeds up the learning process.",

            "text": "Following the work of Hayes and Scassellati (2016) , Roncone et al. (2017) improved the transparent task planner originally proposed by Hayes and Scassellati (2016) , which enables both humans and cobots to reason and communicate about the role of each other so that the other agent can act accordingly. To this end, a hierarchical graphical representation of the task is provided to model the task at an abstract level without details of the implementation. In the task's graphical representation, each sub-task or atomic action, e.g., mounting an object, is shown as a block. While the level of the hierarchy determines the order of sub-tasks/actions, different operators are proposed to show the relation between them, i.e., \"\u2192\" indicates sequential tasks, \" \" determines parallel tasks, and \"\u2228\" is used to show alternative tasks. During task execution, the cobot can provide feedback to the human partner by highlighting its estimation of the current sub-task, i.e., coloring the related block in the graphical presentation. So that the cognitive load of the human partner, i.e., taking care of roles, is reduced and the task is completed in a shorter time. The main drawback of the study by Roncone et al. (2017) is that the interaction is unidirectional, i.e., the cobot can express its status to the human partner, but the human partner cannot transfer knowledge or missing information to the cobot. In contrast, the model proposed in this paper enables the human partner to add missing instructions to the cobot. Edmonds et al. (2019) proposed a framework to generate explanations about cobots' internal decisions. To examine the framework, a scenario is used in which a robot learns from human demonstrations how to open medicine bottles. To this end, three different models are used: 1) a symbolic action planner, which serves as a symbolic representation of the task, 2) a haptic prediction model, which acquires knowledge of the task, e.g., imposed forces and observed human poses, and 3) an improved Earley parsing algorithm which jointly leverages the other two models. In addition, the framework is able to generate explanations. For this, the symbolic action planner provides a mechanistic explanation by visualizing multiple action sequences to describe the process of opening a bottle, i.e., the internal robot gripper state for different actions like approaching the bottle, grasping it, pushing it, etc. The haptic prediction model, on the other hand, provides a functional explanation by visualizing the essential haptic signals to determine the next action. The proposed framework generates explanations in two forms, i.e., a text summary and a visualized description. Based on the obtained results, the latter form is more effective in promoting human trust. Similar to the other mentioned studies, the provided explanations clarify the robot's actions and status for the human partner, but the employed models do not allow the human partner to interact and transfer knowledge to the robot, i.e., it is a unidirectional interaction, while our model provides a bidirectional interaction through which cobots can provide explanations and human partners can provide instructions.",

Thus, Senft et al. (2017) proposed a model to make a robot's learning procedure faster. To this end, he proposed a suggestion and correction system in which a human, as a teacher, provides feedback on a robot's progress in baking a cake. To bake the cake correctly, the robot should be able to select the correct object in every state, otherwise, the task fails. Since the robot indicates its next action by gazing toward the selected objects or location, the human teacher can estimate its next action, and in case, the robot is going to select an incorrect object, the teacher can intervene by recommending the correct object. For instance, if the robot is gazing at a spoon to indicate that it is going to select the spoon to put it in an oven instead of a bowl containing batter, the teacher can select the correct object through right-clicking on the bowl (in the simulation world) to teach the correct action for this state to the robot. Although the study allowed human partners to transfer their knowledge to the robot, the robot cannot express its decision-making rationale to the human partner, i.e., it lacks transparency.",

The Cranfield benchmark comprises of 9 objects: base plate, top plate, square peg (\u00d72), round peg (\u00d72), pendulum, separator, and shaft ( Figure 1 ). To assemble the Cranfield benchmark, the cobot needs to follow 16 constraints ( Table 1) . These constraints come from the fact that when assembling the Cranfield benchmark, the placement of some objects is a prerequisite for the placement of other objects, while for some objects the order of the placement is not important. For instance, the assembly can only start with one of the plates, however, once one of the plates is placed, round pegs, square pegs, and shaft (5 objects) can be placed, while pendulum, separator, and top plate can not be assembled yet. Therefore, in some states of the assembly, several objects can be assembled in parallel, while in some other states, objects should be assembled in a specific order.",

To this end, a button which is labeled as \"Why did you select this object?\" is provided in the proposed T-GUI ( Figure 2A) to enable the human partner to ask for an explanation. To answer this question and generate an appropriate explanation, the cobot utilizes previously obtained constraints that indicate in which state which object can be assembled. All generated explanations have the following structure: \"After assembling list-of-alreadyassembled-objects, possible objects for assembly are: list-ofpossible-objects-in-this-state\". For instance, if base plate and square pegs are assembled, selecting the separator provides a positive reward, thus if the user asks the cobot why it selected the separator for assembly, the cobot can explain: \"After assembling base plate and square pegs, possible objects for assembly are: separator, round peg2, and shaft.\" ( Figures  2C,D) .

To this end, the experimental design is changed so that participants are able to see the explanations for B-GUI and T-GUI in one window (Explanation 1 and Explanation 2 in Figure 2D , respectively). The same truth estimations are used and the experiment is conducted until 25 acceptable sessions are obtained. The self-reported gender is 8 females, 16 males, and one other. Participants' ages ranged from 18 to 51 (M = 36, SD = 7), and none of them had related education or occupational background. To ensure there is no subjects group overlapping, participants are asked if it is the first time they attend the experiment. Additionally, analyzing the demographic data of the participants (age, gender, education, and occupation) there was no overlap between participants in the two experiments. The objective evaluation shows 17 participants are able to select all missing instructions without teaching any wrong instructions to the cobot. It may seem that in the between-subjects experiment more participants gave correct instruction, i.e., 18 out of 21 (in betweensubjects design) in comparison to 17 out of 25 (in within-subjects design). However, it is important to note that, participants should give three instructions to the robot to finish the assembly task, and providing a single mistake leads to separating the participant from those that gave correct instructions. In this manner, the overall number of mistakes in the within-subjects design, i.e., 31 mistakes by 25 participants, is comparable with the overall number of mistakes that were made in the between-subjects design, i.e., 29 mistakes by 21 participants.",

To make a deeper look into the obtained results, Wilcoxon test (in within-subjects design experiment) is applied to participants' ratings to each individual item of the rated scales. Results showed that adding explanation increases users' understanding of how the cobot works (item 1, M = 1.37, SD = 0.63, z = \u2212 2.44, and p = 0.01) and how to use the cobot (item 5, M = 1.5, SD = 0.91, z = \u2212 2.14, and p = 0.03).

They also feel safe so that it is possible to rely on the cobot since it gives right answers (item 12, M = 1.7, SD = 0.78, z = \u2212 2.95, and p = 0.003) and does correct actions (based on its knowledge) (item 11, M = 2.08, SD = 0.99, z = \u2212 2.67, and p = 0.008). Further, participants do not wary the cobot (item 14, M = 2.79, SD = 0.22, z = \u2212 2.23, and p = 0.02). Interestingly, they believe they can use the system for decision making (item 16, M = 1.66, SD = 1.06, z = \u2212 2.6, and p = 0.009), which shows how transparent and reliable the provided model is. They also believe the output of the cobot is predictable (item 10, M = 1.83, SD = 0.94, z = \u2212 3.13, and p = 0.002), which might be due to showing the list of the instructions that the cobot follows, i.e., as the proposed T-GUI provides the instructions, participants can read and predict what will be the next assembly object, which also shows how reasonable the cobot's strategy is. Thus, one can conclude that transparency, i.e., providing an explanation about cobot's actions, enhances the performance of the users, leads to more trust in the cobot's actions, and increases the users' overall satisfaction with the cobot.",

In addition, the results show that the human partner performs better and makes fewer mistakes in teaching, if the cobot explains its behavior. This performance improvement can be due to a better understanding of the task's detail, which is obtained through the explanations provided by the cobot.

Meanwhile the button \"Why did you select this object?\" also is shown, which gives participants the chance to read the cobot's explanation about its action. By clicking on this button, the video stops, and based on the experiment (between-subjects or within-subjects) one of the other three sub-figures, i.e., (B-D), appears. Sub-figures (B, C) are related to the between-subjects design experiment, so that for half of the participants only (B) is shown, and for the other half only (C) is shown. Sub-figure (D) is shown in the within-subjects design experiment, i.e., participants can see explanations generated by the baseline model and the proposed model at the same time.",
