While this network bolsters firefighting capacity, it may also provide pathways for transmission of infectious diseases between fire sites. In this manuscript, we review a first attempt at building an epidemiological model adapted to the interconnected fire system, with the aims of supporting prevention and mitigation efforts along with understanding potential impacts to workforce capacity. Specifically, we developed an agent-based model of COVID-19 built on historical wildland fire assignments using detailed dispatch data from 2016-2018, which form a network of firefighters dispersed spatially and temporally across the US. We used this model to simulate SARS-CoV-2 transmission under several intervention scenarios including vaccination and social distancing. We found vaccination and social distancing are effective at reducing transmission at fire incidents. Under a scenario assuming High Compliance with recommended mitigations (including vaccination), infection rates, number of outbreaks, and worker days missed are effectively negligible, suggesting the recommended interventions could successfully mitigate the risk of cascading infections between fires. Under a contrasting Low Compliance scenario, it is possible for cascading outbreaks to emerge leading to relatively high numbers of worker days missed. As the model was built in 2021 before the emergence of the Delta and Omicron variants, the modeled viral parameters and isolation/quarantine policies may have less relevance to 2022, but nevertheless underscore the importance of following basic prevention and mitigation guidance. This work could set the foundation for future modeling efforts focused on mitigating spread of infectious disease at wildland fire incidents to manage both the health of fire personnel and system capacity.",

While this network bolsters firefighting capacity, it may also provide pathways for transmission of infectious diseases both within personnel at the incident and between fire incidents. According to the National Wildfire Coordinating Group, wildland fire management activities create an \"ideal environment\" for infectious disease transmission due to high-density living and working conditions, lack of access to and use of soap and sanitizers, and a transient workforce, as well as other environmental and occupational factors such as exposure to smoke and fatigue from physically demanding work. The emergence of COVID-19 highlighted the importance of prevention and mitigation of infectious diseases in the wildland fire environment. In this manuscript, we review a first attempt at building an epidemiological model adapted to the interconnected fire system, with the aims of supporting prevention and mitigation efforts along with understanding potential impacts to workforce capacity. The wildland firefighting system in the United States (US) saw unprecedented challenges in 2020 and 2021 as the COVID-19 pandemic added additional complexity to a severe fire season 1 . Concerns about COVID-19 outbreaks at individual fires 2,3 spurred the development of COVID-19 prevention and mitigation procedures including how fire camps were operated and how firefighters interacted with each other 4 . The implications of a COVID-19 outbreak on a single fire have been modeled 3 , but potential system-wide impacts have not yet been explored 5 . Here we explore potential health and workforce capacity impacts by modeling the movement of Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:8320 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12253-x www.nature.com/scientificreports/ wildfire suppression resources across the country over an entire fire season and the corresponding potential for disease spread and cascading outbreaks across wildfire incidents. There were critical uncertainties surrounding the impacts of COVID-19 on the wildland fire system prior to the 2021 fire season. While it was expected that COVID-19 vaccination would mitigate transmission of COVID-19, there was substantial uncertainty surrounding the level of personnel that might be vaccinated 6 as well as potential for breakthrough infections from more transmissible variants, therefore, particularly early in the season, COVID-19 impacts to the wildland firefighting workforce were of high concern 7 . These concerns remain relevant even now and there are compelling reasons to explore these potential impacts; degradation of workforce capacity and operational readiness were acutely felt at times during the 2020 and 2021 fire year. For example, the Cameron Peak fire in 2020 saw 76 SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID- 19) infections and more than 250 personnel isolated over the course of the incident, which saw days with over 1000 personnel assigned to the fire 8 . Furthermore, there was evidence of outbreaks of COVID-19 on wildland fires in 2021 [9] [10] [11] [12] . In addition, COVID-19 was officially documented as the leading cause of death for wildland firefighter deaths in 2021 13 . The modeling effort described herein was performed prior to the 2021 fire season to explore potential impacts of COVID-19 on workforce capacity across a range of scenarios. The results are intended to be used to gain insight into how SARS-CoV-2 could spread in the wildland firefighting community, and how effective vaccination and social distancing may be at protecting workforce health and preventing workforce capacity degradation; as such this paper is not attempting to forecast outbreaks in any future fire season.",

            "text": "Wildland firefighters, particularly those working on large fires, are a highly transient workforce. Regions with low or moderate fire activity allow some of their firefighters to be reassigned to other regions that need additional firefighting capacity 14 . For example, firefighters from the Southwestern region are often used to support fires in the Northern Rockies because the peak fire seasons differ across the regions. Figure 1 depicts the incoming assignments originating all over the country and outbound reassignments to a particular fire in Montana. These cross-boundary assignments provide flexibility in wildfire response capacity as single incidents can require thousands of personnel, however they also pose a potential threat in the context of infectious disease spread. Reassignments from one fire to another often happen within a few days, thus, an outbreak of disease at one fire has the potential to spread to other fires. These cascading effects can accelerate SARS-CoV-2 spread across the national wildland firefighting workforce as the fire season progresses. In addition to the health risks associated with SARS-CoV-2 outbreaks, multiple fires with outbreaks could lead to resource deficits, with a sizable portion of firefighters out sick or quarantined 8 . Because the firefighting workforce is finite and, at the height of the fire season, some requests for firefighters go unfilled 15 , losing a portion of the workforce to sickness and quarantine is a significant concern. Therefore, there is a need for model-based assessment of COVID-19 risk at the national, seasonal scale.",

SARS-CoV-2 can spread within a fire as described in Fig. 2 and between fires as those firefighters are reassigned to other fires across the country throughout the season (Fig. 1 ).

The granularity of the model allows us to investigate the burden of COVID-19 as well as its impact on workforce capacity on multiple scales from individual fires to the system as a whole. While the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 cases acquired on large wildland fires is not well tracked, there is some data on cases discovered on large wildland fires in 2021. We use this data to assess general model performance.",

            "text": "We developed scenarios to address two key uncertainties in the interplay between the fire season and the COVID-19 pandemic: vaccination and social distancing behaviors of wildland fire personnel and the spatio-temporal variation of fire occurrence. These scenarios were tailored to the pre-2021 fire season conditions. We addressed the uncertainty in vaccination rate and compliance to social distancing behaviors among wildland fire personnel by creating three distinct behavioral scenarios: a low behavior compliance scenario, a baseline scenario, and a high behavior compliance scenario. The \"Low Compliance\" scenario assumes less compliance with infection control measures (i.e., low effort to maintain social distancing and lower percentages of individuals correctly diagnosing their symptoms) and fewer vaccinated individuals. The \"High Compliance\" scenario assumes more compliance with social distancing, more frequent diagnosis of symptoms, and more vaccinated individuals. The \"Baseline\" scenario assumes a moderate level of social distancing compliance, symptom identification, and vaccination. An overview of parameters used for each scenario can be found in the Methods section. We addressed the variation in fire occurrence patterns by using fire assignments from three distinct fire seasons: 2016, 2017, and 2018. These years cover a range of spatial and temporal demand for wildland fire suppression resources. We simulated the model 100 times in each scenario (Baseline, High Compliance, Low Compliance) for each fire season to illustrate the uncertainty due to stochastic transmission and yearly variation in firefighter assignments. We focused our analyses of the results on four outcomes relevant to the wildfire management community: (1) the number of cumulative infections over the season, (2) outbreaks of COVID-19 on individual fires, (3) reassignments of infectious personnel between fires, and (4) workforce absenteeism due to quarantine. Here, we report median values of the 100 simulations along with the interquartile range (IQR; indicates the central 50% of the distribution). Figure 3 illustrates the number of cumulative infections contracted both on and off of active duty across the three scenarios over the duration of the season using 2017 fire assignment data. There were 43,360 personnel assigned to at least one large fire in 2017. Figure 3 shows that the number of infections acquired off-fire is substantially more than those acquired on-fire. Using only the Baseline results across all three years, our results suggest that approximately 95% of infections are acquired while firefighters are off duty in these scenarios. Many of these infections acquired off duty may be asymptomatic and pose a risk to other firefighters once the infected individual is deployed to an incident. The Low Compliance median percentage of personnel acquiring SARS-CoV-2 off-fire is about 9.4%. Figure 3 also shows that transmission on fires closely follows wildfire activity over The number of contacts and the intensity of those contacts is not homogeneous across personnel. This is reflected in our model structure and parameters (see the Materials section and supplementary materials for details). We therefore examined the number of on-fire infections that occurred specifically within management personnel and crew personnel modules (Fig. 3b ).We find that in the Low Compliance scenario, there is a relatively high ratio of management to crew infections for cases incurred on a fire as compared to those incurred off fire (a median of 279.5 (IQR: 251.8-308.8) and 169.5 (IQR: 155.8-182.2) infections incurred on fire and a median of 121 (IQR: 112-128) and 4205 (IQR: 4161-4234) infections incurred off fire by management and crew, respectively). As compliance with mitigation measures increases, the ratio of management to crew on-fire cases goes down. This likely reflects the contact structure for management personnel (they are exposed to more people each day) and the isolation procedures (only the symptomatic person isolates if they are management as opposed to the entire module for crew personnel). The higher caseloads incurred on fire by management personnel has significant implications. First, management personnel tend to be older than crew personnel, which means they are also at higher risk of severe symptoms. Second, key management positions require high levels of qualifications, so higher caseloads in management personnel may burden the wildland firefighting system more than caseloads in crew personnel.",

While the number of individual cases are an important systemic outcome, outbreaks of COVID-19 on a wildfire incident can add substantial burden on the management team. Therefore, for each run we counted the number of cases of SARS-CoV-2 on each fire. If a fire incurred at least two cases from different crew modules, two management personnel with cases, or a combination of crew and management personnel with cases, we counted that fire as having an outbreak for that run. Figure 4a shows the percentage of runs for which each incident had an outbreak by the maximum number of personnel assigned to the fire on a single day. We find that the incidents most likely to see outbreaks are the incidents with the highest number of maximum personnel assigned. Compliance with interventions has a greater impact the larger the number of personnel on the fire. While the maximum number of personnel on the fire has a strong relationship with the percentage of runs in which each fire experiences outbreaks, duration of the fire also plays an important role. We single out two fires in Fig. 4a : the points associated with one fire are circled in blue (the \"many-outbreaks fire\") and the points associated with the second fire have pink squares around them (the \"fewer-outbreaks fire\"). When we examine the number of personnel on the fire over time (Fig. 4b) , we see that the many-outbreaks fire lasted much longer than the fewer-outbreaks fire.",

We find that the number of infectious assignments from personnel who contracted SARS-CoV-2 off fire is higher than the number of infectious reassignments from personnel who went from one fire to another while in an exposed or infectious state (Fig. 5a) A comparison of two specific runs illustrates the effectiveness of mitigation measures in reducing infectious reassignments.

In addition to the health of firefighting personnel, agency administrators are concerned with workforce capacity and the ability to accomplish firefighting objectives. When a firefighter self-identifies as infected, that individual's module is quarantined to reduce transmission.

The tool was not intended to capture information from all fires but rather those incidents meeting large fire criteria where COVID-19 activities such as testing and isolation were ongoing.

            "text": "Our primary focus here was analyzing potential COVID-19 impacts to workforce health and capacity, a topic of growing importance as increasing fire activity is expected to further strain the response capabilities of the system 26 . There are three primary workforce-related factors to consider. First, not captured in our analysis but worth mentioning, management of COVID-19 creates additional workload burden including screening/testing, isolating/quarantining, and interfacing with entities such as local public health agencies and hospitals-and this burden increases with the number of infections and outbreaks. Second, worker absenteeism due to isolation/ quarantine requires greater coordination and prioritization of scarce resources both within and across incidents, and in some cases results in unfilled resource requests and understaffed incidents 15 . Depending on the degree of scarcity and substitutability of the affected resources 27 , this could result in inability to implement preferred strategies and tactics (e.g., lack of crews) or incident management organizations operating outside of their typical span of control (e.g., lack of key management personnel). Third, and perhaps most important to the workforce, missed days can translate into loss of assignments and loss of pay. For some of the firefighting workforce, the bulk of their annual salary comes from their time on assignment when their pay rate is increased due to overtime hours and hazard pay. In some cases, due to minimum personnel requirements for certain assignments, entire crews could be deemed unqualified if only some members of their team are in isolation or quarantine. Vaccination in such cases would insure against crew members having to quarantine due to exposure and would make more crews generally more available for assignments. This point naturally leads to a primary finding of this analysis, that high vaccination rates in combination with the policy that vaccinated individuals do not need to quarantine after exposure results in significantly fewer Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:8320 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-12253-x www.nature.com/scientificreports/ worker days missed compared to other scenarios. The best case (High Compliance scenario with the quarantine policy implemented in early 2021) results in on average more than five times fewer missed worker days than the worst case (Low Compliance scenario without quarantine policy). Hence the importance of capturing uncertainty around vaccination uptake in any risk assessment and more broadly the importance of vaccination in maintaining system capacity. Further, model results suggest that vaccination and disease spread mitigations reduce both infections and workforce absenteeism in the wildland fire community. There are two primary mechanisms at play: 1) vaccination and spread mitigation efforts keep infections low, leading to fewer isolations and 2) vaccinations allow exposed personnel to avoid quarantine. The contact structure of our ABM accounted for organizational structure and social distancing mitigations, and the ABM also captured heterogeneity in quarantine requirements according to individual agent and module status. The contact structure also led to the finding that infection risks may be higher for personnel that cannot effectively social distance or limit their contacts.",

Exposed individuals are those that have been exposed to the virus at a high enough viral load that they will become infectious. Infectious individuals are classified as symptomatic or asymptomatic. Symptomatic individuals have (or will eventually) develop COVID-19 symptoms and are able to spread the virus to others. Asymptomatic individuals are infectious but never show symptoms; these individuals are capable of spreading SARS-CoV-2 to others, but due to a lower viral load have a lower rate of transmission than those who are symptomatic 31 . Recovered individuals are those who have recovered from infection and are no longer able to spread SARS-CoV-2 to others.",

Transmission between fires occurs when exposed or infectious individuals leave one fire and are subsequently reassigned to another fire within the infectious period. When individuals are not on a fire, their probability of becoming infected is driven by prevalence-dependent geographic area specific parameters. While an individual will not spread infection to any other firefighters during the period they are off assignment, they can catch SARS-CoV-2 off-fire. They may then arrive at their next assignment exposed or infectious, at which point they may become a source of infection for that fire.

See left panel in Fig. 2 for an illustration of the possible paths individuals may take through viral states. In addition to tracking the daily viral state of each individual, the model also tracks each individual's vaccination state. Our model has two vaccination states: vaccinated and unvaccinated. At the beginning of each simulation run a pre-specified number of firefighters is designated as vaccinated (dependent on the scenario). Over the course of the simulation an additional pre-specified number of individuals are vaccinated; personnel in isolation cannot become vaccinated, but individuals can get vaccinated while in any viral state. To model vaccine efficacy, a pre-specified proportion of susceptible individuals move from their current viral state directly to recovered, reflecting that those individuals cannot become infected or spread infection to others. The vaccinated individuals who do not move into the recovered class are still considered susceptible and are able to acquire and spread SARS-CoV-2.",

The fire camp and incident command post have provided conditions where other infectious diseases have spread with ease 3, 4 . However, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, several mitigation measures were developed to minimize contact between wildland fire personnel at large fire incidents. One of these measures was referred to as \"module-as-one\" 5 . This is a specific form of social distancing, by which crews seek to minimize all contact outside of their own crew. This practice is expected to continue through the 2021 fire season. To simulate module-as-one behavior, we grouped personnel associated with a specific crew or piece of ground equipment into a single module. Because management personnel are not able to be part of a module due to their duties requiring them to interact with a higher number of people, though at lower contact intensities, we treated them differently than crew personnel. These management personnel are the fire managers, planners and logistics personnel who spend most of their time at the incident management post. Thus, all personnel assigned to a management role are considered to be a single module in our model, and that module has different spread parameters associated with it. This logic for organizing personnel results in many 4-20 person modules on each fire in addition to a single management module which reflects the actual module structure on wildland fire incidents in 2020. In our simulation, one set of individuals is designated as the module leaders, and those are the only individuals that have contacts with others outside of their module (see right panel in Fig. 2 for an example) . Specifically, the leaders of each module contact only the leaders of the other modules. We assume four leaders per module for all crew modules. The management module has substantially more leaders than other modules because management personnel are regularly interacting with module leaders. Leadership status is randomly assigned to the individuals within a module each time a module mobilizes to an incident and stays constant for the duration of the assignment. Generally, modules move throughout the fire season intact, with few changes to personnel within the module. However, individuals on modules can change. Any individuals mobilized to a fire who are not assigned to an engine or crew module are classified as management; this is consistent with actual fire ordering practice. Contact between module members is substantially higher than contact between leaders, as module members are assumed to eat, sleep, and socialize together. Therefore, we provide a parameter to increase transmission between module members.",

For those individuals who do enter isolation, we base our isolation procedures on CDC guidelines 32 : once an individual is identified as infectious they isolate for 10 days or until 24 h after symptoms are gone (i.e., one day after they move to the recovered state), whichever is longer. To reflect current practice, if an individual on a module isolates, all other individuals in their module must quarantine, regardless of viral state. Our model assumes full isolation during quarantine (i.e., isolated individuals do not transmit disease to any other individuals). The exception to this is the management modules; for those modules only the diagnosed individual is isolated. While in reality asymptomatic individuals could be isolated in response to a positive test, we did not include testing of non-symptomatic individuals in our simulations as that is not expected to be routine for firefighting personnel on all assignments.

For symptomatic individuals, this is less likely to occur than for asymptomatic individuals, as a percentage of symptomatic individuals are assumed to recognize their symptoms and move into isolation. This percentage of symptomatic individuals who move into isolation is dependent on the level of mitigation compliance. For asymptomatic individuals, this fire to fire spread is more likely to occur as the only reason they would move into quarantine is if another module member is symptomatic and has recognized their symptoms. For viruses with a short period of time of symptomless infectiousness, few asymptomatic cases, and easily diagnosable symptoms, this isolation and quarantine policy would make reassignments that spread disease quite unlikely. However, COVID-19 has been associated with infectiousness prior to symptom onset 33 , a substantial proportion of asymptomatic cases 34 , and symptoms that may be attributable to the smoky conditions and physical exertion that firefighters regularly encounter 8 , thus, even with a strict isolation and quarantine policy SARS-CoV-2 may spread from one fire to another.",

The model then steps through each day in the fire season, checking daily on each individual's assignment, module, and role and simulating and tracking individuals' daily viral, vaccination, and isolation/quarantine status. Individuals' contacts with others in their module and leaders' contact with each other is modeled on each incident; an average number of infectionspreading contacts is calculated for each module and the group of leaders. This average number of infectious contacts that lead to a new infection is used as the mean of a Poisson distribution that is used to randomly assign to each individual on that module the number of successful infectious contacts they had that day. Any individual assigned one or more infection-producing close contacts with an infectious individual becomes exposed. Individuals who are off fire may contact SARS-CoV-2 with a probability dependent upon local transmission. Exposed and infectious individuals' states are re-evaluated daily, and individuals move from exposed to symptomatic or asymptomatic and from symptomatic or asymptomatic to recovered based upon the daily probability of changing viral states (see supplementary material for specifics). In addition to daily re-evaluation of infectious states, individuals are also assessed for isolation. Symptomatic individuals are assigned to be in isolation based upon a random draw. Individuals within the same module as an isolated individual are then quarantined. Individuals move out of isolation and vaccination occurs based upon the isolation and vaccination methods described above.",

Using these data we can track individuals uniquely across the fire season, identifying their daily assignments to large fires, the role they play on those fires, and the geographic area within which they are working. The 2016 fire season was a fairly average season, with slightly fewer fires and slightly fewer acres burned than the ten-year average, though the number of structures burned was slightly over the yearly average (calculated since 1999; NICC 2016). The 2017 fire season was a more severe fire season than 2016, with the number of acres burned well above the ten-year average as well as setting the record for most structures burned (1999-2017; NICC 2017).

In addition, this ABM might also be repurposed for a variety of other applications in fire, ranging from optimal coordination and routing of aircraft to individual crew member movement and engagement in containment activities.",
