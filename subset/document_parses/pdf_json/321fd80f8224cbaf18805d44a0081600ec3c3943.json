Subsequently, by introducing the inverted residual channel attention and the pyramid pooling module, a new structure of MIP is created and used as the backbone extractor of MIP-MY, which could further decrease the number of parameters and fuse context information. en the multiple receptive field module is added after the three effective feature layers of the backbone extractor, which effectively enhances the information extraction ability of the deep feature layer and reduces the miss detection rate of small pulmonary tuberculosis lesions. Finally, the pulmonary tuberculosis detection model MIP-MY with lightweight and multiple receptive field characteristics is constructed by combining each improved modules with multiscale structure. Compared to the original YOLOv4, the model parameters of MIP-MY is reduced by 47%, while the mAP value is raised to 95.32% and the miss detection rate is decreased to 6%. It is verified that the model can effectively assist radiologists in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis.",

Improving the awareness rate and early detection rate of pulmonary tuberculosis plays a vital role in the treatment of the disease, as well as the prevention of the spread of the disease [3] . Computed tomography (CT) is one of the auxiliary imaging diagnostic methods for tuberculosis screening, having a lower missed detection and false detection rate than chest radiographs.

            "text": "Considering that the current detection model for pulmonary CT disease has the problem of excessive parameters and does not use effective lightweight methods, it may be a feasible strategy to learn from the lightweight methods in other detection fields. In reference [11] , Ye et al. [11] replaced the backbone network of YOLOv4 [12] through MobileNetv3 [13] and realized the lightweight of the model. Although Mobilenetv3 reduces the amount of parameters, if it is directly used in the detection of pulmonary tuberculosis CT, it may lack the mining of deep feature information of the image, which is not enough to solve the problem of missed detection rate of small targets by YOLOv4, and the detection accuracy needs to be further improved. Reference [14] achieves lightweight by reducing the number of convolution layers in YOLOv5 [15] , which obviously improves the detection speed. However, because the lightweight YOLOv5 focuses on the detection of large targets, the detection performance of small targets is still slightly insufficient. Small lesions on pulmonary tuberculosis CT cannot be ignored. e structure and performance of YOLOv5 are less different from those of YOLOv4. erefore, improving on YOLOv4 is an effective strategy. CT images of pulmonary tuberculosis have mainly have typical features such as cavity [16] and tree-in-bud pattern [17] . However, open data sets are uneven and there is no uniform format, so it is essential to design a set of standard datasets. Additionally, the existing tuberculosis detection model has a large number of parameters and consumes a lot of computing resources, which makes it difficult to be applied to medical institutions with a large number of highperformance equipment. erefore, it is an important goal to realize the lightweight of the model. At the same time, an ordinary lightweight detection model cannot obtain the deeper semantic information of CT images, resulting in a high rate of missed detection. erefore, ensuring high detection accuracy and efficiency of tuberculosis simultaneously is one of the main objectives of this study, which is of great significance for tuberculosis screening and diagnosis.",

Although YOLOv4 has a high confidence score, it fails to detect small lesions because the down sampling scale of the backbone extractor is too large and the spatial and pixel information of some small lesions is ignored in the layer-by-layer feature extraction. However, if the down sampling scale is reduced, the detection accuracy of other targets cannot be guaranteed. In Figure 10 , it shows that U-Net makes miss detection in a tiny cavity, compared with the ability of Faster-RCNN to accurately capture cavities of various sizes. But in the example in Figure 12 , U-Net and Faster-RCNN also omitted the detection in some inconspicuous tree-in-bud pattern.",

At the same time, the pulmonary tuberculosis lesion detected by MIP-MY has a high-level confidence score, which provides a reliable digital explanation for the automatic diagnosis ability of the detection model.",

Comparative experiments with other references show that MIP-MY has a lower number of parameters, better detection efficiency and accuracy, and its multiple receptive field characteristics strengthen the attention to small lesions and greatly reduce the possibility of misdetection. To sum up, the improved model MIP-MY achieves higher detection accuracy, realizes the automatic detection of pulmonary tuberculosis cavity and tree-in-bud pattern with lower calculation cost, and has excellent imaging diagnostic potential of pulmonary tuberculosis. In subsequent studies, more effective data enhancement techniques can be used to enrich the diversity of pulmonary tuberculosis CT data, such as generating game networks (GAN) to generate more samples. In addition, the generality of the model will be studied to make MIP-MY model suitable for the detection of common lung diseases, including lung cancer and pneumonia.",
