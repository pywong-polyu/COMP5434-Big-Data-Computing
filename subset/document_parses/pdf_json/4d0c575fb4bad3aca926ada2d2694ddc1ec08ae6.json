For this purpose, acquiring updated knowledge regarding prevention and disinfection during the current pandemic is necessary for every dental practitioner. In our study, we aimed to evaluate globally the level of knowledge and the attitude of dental practitioners related to disinfection. A total of 385 participants out of 401 participants from 23 different countries across the world were included in the final analysis after the exclusion of incomplete responses. The majority of the dentists who responded were females (53.8%) and were practicing at private health institutes (36.4%). The mean knowledge score of the participants was estimated to be 4.19 \u00b1 1.88 out of 12, reflecting insufficient knowledge, and the mean attitude score of the participants was estimated to be 12.24 \u00b1 3.23 out of 15, which shows a positive attitude toward disinfection practices during coronavirus 2019 . Thus, the current study indicated a lack of knowledge in fundamental aspects of disinfection protocols with a significant and positive attitude from dental health professionals toward disinfection regarding the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic.",

The virus was found to be genetically similar to previous bat-originated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-like corona-viruses [2] . However, the origin of COVID-19 is still unclear [2, 3] . The illness caused by this virus ranges from asymptomatic or mild symptoms to more severe clinical manifestations, including severe respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation [4] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 5.8 million COVID-19 confirmed cases have already been reported globally (https://covid19.who.int/).",

The SARS-CoV-2 is stable at 4 \u2022 C for up to 14 days [6] . When the temperature is increased to 70 \u2022 C, its infectivity remains only for 5 minutes. Similarly, coronaviruses have been shown to persist on inanimate surfaces, such as metal, plastic, or glass for up to a period of 9 days or until disinfected [7] . Currently, no treatment for COVID-19 is available. Few potential therapies are in the trial phase leaving mainly supportive and preventive strategies against this disease [5] . The rapid testing of this disease is possible through blood, saliva, and nasopharyngeal swabs [8] . With the help of rapid point-of-care (POC) technology, transmission can be controllable [9] .",

The dental practitioners and practices have the potential to spread the disease to the population unknowingly, if the precautions are not being strictly followed.

The eligibility criteria consisted of qualified male or female dental healthcare professionals globally, aged 25 years or more, including dental practitioners and clinical post-graduate students who understood the content of the survey and agreed to participate in the study.

Likewise, 50% of the participants thought that handwashing with only soap and water was adequate when hands were visibly soiled. On the contrary, based on the previous studies [20, 21] related to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Corona Virus (MERS-COV), the WHO recommended handwashing with soap and water for 20 seconds followed by alcohol-based hand rub (ABHR) for visibly soiled hands.",

Similarly, most of the participants thought that chlorhexidine is currently recommended as a pre-procedural mouth rinse. However, chlorhexidine has been discouraged from being used for the purpose of reducing the COVID-19 viral load. On the other hand, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 0.23% to 7% povidine-iodine (PVP-I) or 1.5% hydrogen peroxide-containing mouthwashes are recommended as a pre-procedural mouth rinse [24, 25] . One study also suggested the potential use of mouthwashes containing cetylpyridinium chloride (CPC) 0.045% to 0.1% in the future against COVID-19. Recently, an in vitro study reported outcomes of 0.5%, 1%, and 1.5%, of PVP-I completely inactivating SARS-CoV-2 within 15 s of contact [12] .
