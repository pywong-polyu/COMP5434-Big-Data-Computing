Poor outcomes in preterm children have been attributed to the aversive sounds and relative speech paucity of the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Experimental studies that directly expose preterm infants to speech sounds in the NICU find significant improvements in health factors relevant for neurodevelopment. Few studies have examined whether natural variations in the speech environment of the NICU are related to shortterm health outcomes in preterm infants. Such data are important for optimizing the sound environment of the NICU.",

In experimental studies, preterm infants directly exposed to speech sounds in the NICU demonstrate improved health outcomes, including increased oxygen saturation 10, 11 , feeding tolerance 12, 13 and decreased apnea and bradycardia events 14 .

We focused on weight gain because it is critical for infant health and is associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes during infancy and young adulthood [15] [16] [17] [18] . There is also evidence that directed biological maternal sounds, which include filtered speech exposure, are directly related to weight gain velocity 19 . To obtain continuous measurements of the NICU speech environment, we employed a speech counting device, the Starling (Versame, Inc, Menlo Park, CA). We analyzed the NICU speech environment when preterm infants were between 32-36 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA). We hypothesized that infants who experienced higher level of speech exposure at 32-36 weeks PMA, indexed as speech counts from the Starling, would be significantly and positively correlated with greater weight gain during the same developmental period.",

Starling uses speech recognition technology to generate estimates of the amount of vocal activity that is near and clear to the device. The Starling device generates speech counts in real time and does not save an audiorecording, removing concerns about privacy and reducing the potential that the presence of the device may alter speech behavior. Importantly, speech counting algorithms in Starling were designed to be particularly robust in the presence of environmental noise, an advantage in the often-noisy open-bay NICU environment. In a previous study, Starling was found to be sensitive to variations in the amount of speech that occurred in relation to specific NICU care practices. 20 Moreover, proof-of-concept testing demonstrated that Starling showed substantial correspondence to speech counts obtained from the Language ENvironment Analysis (LENA) digital language processor (LENA Research Foundation, Boulder, CO), a speech recording device that has been used in studies assessing NICU sound environments 9 .",

Approximately every 5 days, a research assistant would recharge, sync, and download daily speech counts per 5 minutes from cloud-based servers. The positions of the Starling devices were also checked and timing of changes in bed type were noted (e.g., the infant moved from an incubator to an open crib).

Given variable lengths in data collection due to factors such as differences in GA at birth and/or length of hospital stay, we approximated the speech environment of the NICU by analyzing speech counts that occurred within same developmental age period for all infants: 32 weeks; 0 days to 36 weeks; 6 days postmenstrual age (PMA). This age-range was chosen because infants are capable of perceiving human speech sounds at this GA and are more likely to be medically stable and thus able to tolerate speech exposure. Thus, mean counts reported here reflect only speech experiences that occurred during this window, even though some infants may have had data collected prior or after that period.

Table 3 shows multiple regression models exploring prediction to rates of weight gain from caloric intake and speech counts as measured by Starling. Model 1 shows that caloric intake made a significant contribution to weight gains, contributing approximately 31% , F(1,18) = 8.2, p = .01. Importantly, Model 2 shows that the addition of speech counts contributed an additional 29% of the variance, F(1, 17) = 12.4, p = .003, nearly doubling the variance accounted for overall, F(2, 17) = 12.8, p < .001. This effect is illustrated in Figure 1 . These results suggest that variation in the amount of speech that infants experience during their NICU stay is associated with overall health improvements as indexed by weight gain, even beyond other important predictors like caloric intake. Finally, Models 3, 4, and 5 show that the association between speech counts and weight gain remained significant after controlling for frequency of family visitation, time in incubator, and health acuity composite score, respectively. None of these factors contributed significant additional variance. Thus, the association between variation in quantity of speech experience and infant weight gain is attributable to variability in the experiences that infants receive in the NICU and are not reducible to whether or not family visited, the type of bed infants experienced, or the overall health of the infant.",

Here, our study provides novel evidence that variations in the NICU speech environment may also play a role in infant weight gain, an important index of infant physical health. Concerns regarding possible stress to infants from sound exposure, and thus worsened weight gain, may impede opportunities for infants to be exposed to speech. In addition, infants with slower weight gain may be kept in an incubator for longer periods, limiting opportunities for speech exposure. Such clinical decisions may be creating or contributing to our measured association. At the same time, the direction of the present association between infant growth and speech exposure merits further discussion. It may have been that infants in our study who gained more weight may have been more active or had more engaging behaviors than infants of lower weights, thus triggering more speech directed to them at bedside. Studies that directly manipulate the amount of speech input provided to preterm infants are likely to be critical for determining whether and how care practices should be modified to enhance speech exposure during NICU hospitalization 23 .",

Taken together, these findings suggest that the factors that may account for increased speech counts in open-cribs versus incubators (e.g., more overheard speech from staff) are likely to differ from those at are associated with infants' weight gain. Further studies are needed to identify the specific linguistic factors that may contribute to variability in the NICU speech environment. Such studies could help clarify whether different types of speech (e.g., infant directed speech or \"parentese\" 24 versus adult directed speech) and/or sources of speech input (primary caregivers vs clinical staff) are relevant factors that are related to variations in health and later neurodevelopmental outcomes.",

For analyses, infants were grouped by presence/absence of any of these four conditions, yielding a scale from 0 to 4.
