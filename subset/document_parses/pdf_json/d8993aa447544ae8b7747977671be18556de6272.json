A datadriven approach was developed to estimate medical resource deficiencies due to medical burdens at county level during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study duration was mainly from February 15, 2020 to May 1, 2020 in the U.S. Multiple data sources were used to extract local population, hospital beds, critical care staff, COVID-19 confirmed case numbers, and hospitalization data at county level. We estimated the average length of stay from hospitalization data at state level, and calculated the hospitalized rate at both state and county level. Then, we developed two medical resource deficiency indices that measured the local medical burden based on the number of accumulated active confirmed cases normalized by local maximum potential medical resources, and the number of hospitalized patients that can be supported per ICU bed per critical care staff, respectively. Data on medical resources, and the two medical resource deficiency indices are illustrated in a dynamic spatiotemporal visualization platform based on ArcGIS Pro Dashboards. Our results provided new insights into the U.S. pandemic preparedness and local dynamics relating to medical burdens in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Just before the global pandemic COVID-19, a report by the Global Health Security Index was released, which is the first-ever comprehensive ranking of 195 countries based on their pandemic preparedness, with six categories of 140 questions and 34 indicators [1] . Although national health security is fundamentally weak across the globe, the U.S. scored 83.5/100 and ranked No.1 in a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 a1111111111 the report. As evidence, there were 34.7 critical care beds per 100,000 inhabitants in the U.S. by 2009, which is higher than that of any other country [2, 3] . However, the U.S. has fewer hospital beds (2.8), and practicing physicians (2.6) per 1,000 capita compared to other similar large and wealthy countries [4] .",

S. population would test positive for COVID-19 even given a conservative estimation [5] .

This projection is generally compatible with the characteristics of COVID-19 in Wuhan, China, where 5% of patients required the intensive care unit and 2.3% required a ventilator [7] . Based on a recent CDC survey, the actual weekly hospitalization rate in April 2020 was around 5.8-7.5% for 100 counties across 14 states [8], which means a large number of infected patients will swarm into hospitals and ICUs. As a matter of fact, the U.S. had the highest number of confirmed cases of COVID- 19 (82,404) in the world on March 26, 2020, and surpassed Italy for the highest national death toll (20, 413) on April 11, 2020 [9, 10] .",

The Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) released a report regarding the medical resources both available and needed for a potentially overwhelming number of critically ill patients [6] . In this report, three fundamental elements or features, i.e. ventilators, ICU beds, and critical care staff (CCS) were identified as medical resources to plan for or manage a COVID-19 pandemic, and it would be wise to consider the interconnections among these factors in a spatiotemporal data analysis framework. Specifically, the medical resource distribution should be correlated with COVID-19 pandemic statistics in space (2D) and time (1D). So medical resource burden or deficiency can be identified through feature selection, visualization, monitoring, and cluster analysis [11] .",

Based on a 2009 AHA survey, a total of 5,752 U.S. acute care hospitals were estimated to have 62,188 full-featured mechanical ventilators and 98,738 ventilators with limited features [12] . The Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) had an estimated 8,900 ventilators for emergency deployment in 2010, and between 12,000 and 13,000 ventilators by March 13, 2020 [13-15] . Based on these numbers, the ventilator inventory was approximately 173,000-174,000 in the U.S. A model-based analysis suggested that US hospitals could absorb between 26,200 to 56,300 additional ventilators at the peak of a national pandemic with robust pre-pandemic planning [16] . Since SNS can deliver ventilators within 24-36 hours after being requested by states and approved by federal organizations, and no reliable database for ventilator inventory exists at county or state level, we will not consider this factor in our spatiotemporal analysis. A recent model-driven study simply assumes one ventilator per critical care bed [17] and we use this same assumption in our analysis.",

The second type of capacity refers to the number of adult ICU beds that could be used for COVID-19. During this crisis, hospitals could use additional intensive care beds to supplement an influx of patients. Therefore, adult ICU beds include not only internal medical ICU beds, but also burn, surgical, and trauma ICU beds.

Both maps show that these two medical resources are not homogeneously distributed across the U.S. Some midwestern states, such as North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Montana have more ICU beds, but less CCS. The spatial distribution of CCS shows a checker board pattern, with many gaps or low numbers across the country. The product of ICU beds and CCS per 1,000 residents is shown in Fig 6A. The darkest green zones represent counties with higher quantities of medical resources including ICU beds and CCS. A total of 19 major medical centers represent top ranking healthcare facilities in the U.S. (Table 2 ) [27] . Medical centers are conglomerations of health care facilities including hospitals and research facilities that could be affiliated with a medical school. Overlaying the locations of these 19 medical centers on the map (purple circles on the map), it seems these counties and medical centers are spatially highly correlated (Fig 6A) .",

By clicking the polygon of a selected county, attribute information about medical resources and COVID-19 related data would popup and the relevant chart is automatically updated in the dashboard. Northern Tennessee State is presented as a use case to show the possible interactive analysis (Fig 4) . Since western and east coast regions have more medical resources than central regions (Fig 6A) , and the states along the Mississippi River in the southern U.S. show a high risk (Fig  10) , we zoom in on the map and select the nearest region with the largest red bubble in Tennessee (Fig 4) . Thirty counties are selected as a result, and relevant numbers are calculated and presented in dashboard charts. The medical bed pie chart shows ICU beds are 10.89% in overall licensed beds, and the medical staff pie chart shows the nurses group is the highest (55.77%) followed by physicians (44.01%), physician assistants (0.18%) and therapists (0.04%). The line chart shows a time-series trend for MRDI in the northern Tennessee area, and we find the index varied greatly between April 30, 2020 to May 1, 2020, which could be explained by the possible tracing of the virus to a correction center outbreak in Trousdale County [32] . On the right column of the dashboard, the risk factors of medical resource and infection rate is ranked by the selected region. Trousdale, Davidson, and Sumner County are the top 3 with highest infection risks, while Trousdale also shows the highest medical resource risk in this region.

The average length of stay (ALOS) was then estimated from hospitalization data at state level, and the hospitalized rate were calculated at state and county level. Based on these datasets, we developed two medical resource deficiency indices MRDI and MRDI d that measure the local medical burden from two different perspectives. The first index represents the number of accumulated active confirmed cases normalized by local maximum potential medical resources; and the second one represents the number of hospitalized patients that can be supported per ICU beds per critical care staff. The related medical resource data, MRDI and MRDI d were visualized and analyzed using a dynamic spatiotemporal platform created through ArcGIS Pro Dashboards, which is a convenient way to enhance the clustering patterns and trends.",

As a result, MRDI d may also be slightly underestimated. We also did not consider the ratio of ICU patients and acute hospitalized patients due to lack of data, and assumed all hospitalized patients were treated as ICU cases. As a result, MRDI d was possibly overestimated, and the values calculated here should be viewed as the upper limit of local medical burdens. Some other uncertainties include (1) the numbers of registered hospital beds and CCS could be incomplete or not up-to-date, although the most recent Definitive Healthcare and NPI databases have been used, so the medical resources could be underestimated, (2) critically ill patients in counties without ICU beds and CCS would be sent to neighboring counties with sufficient medical resources, (3) some numbers of experienced ICU staff may become ill, (4) the number of trained professionals may have increased based on emergent recruiting, and (5) the capacity in ICUs and emergency rooms may have been expanded during the crisis. However, MRDI d can still serve as a useful indicator to measure the county-level medical resource deficiencies, and this index can be improved once more public health data are available in the future. Furthermore, it could provide reasonable evidence for policy makers in local and state governments to assess their medical inventories and staff resources, and provide preparedness for decision of re-opening the economies and public life.",
