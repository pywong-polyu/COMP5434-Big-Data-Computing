They are more vulnerable to stress because they have limited psychosocial resources to deal with stressors. Consequently, socially devalued people are at increased risk of psychological distress or mental disorders (Pearlin, 1993) . Depression, post-traumatic stress, and insomnia are related to biological traits that interact in complex ways with psychological, cultural, and social factors (Danylova, 2019) . Phelan et al. (2008) consider that stigmatization is configured as a mechanism of exploitation or domination, social control, or disease avoidance. Therefore, the fear of infection by coronavirus disease explains the discrimination related to the pandemic , the negative attitude towards people of Asian origin due to the supposed origin of the virus (Trammell et al., 2021; Wen et al., 2020) and towards symptomatic people suspected of or diagnosed with COVID-19 (Nuckchady, 2021) . In the same way, the fear of COVID-19 promoted violent actions towards health workers due to the employment relationship with the disease (Chanpa et al., 2020; Miconi et al., 2021) and towards people who recovered from COVID-19 due to infection (Singh & Subedi, 2020) .",
