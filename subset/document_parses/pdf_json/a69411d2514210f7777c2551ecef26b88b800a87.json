In addition, data regarding antimicrobial use (AMU), farm hygiene, and farm management were collected in order to identify possible risks for ESBL occurrence. Ten farms participated in the study with a median of 781 milking cows (319-1701). All calves investigated were younger than two weeks with an average age of 6.8 (\u00b13.9) days. The farms were visited and samples were collected twice at an interval of 7-11 months. Faecal samples diluted 1:10, were plated onto Brilliance TM ESBL agar in duplicates. After 24 hours at 37\u02daC, colonies were counted and total colony forming units (cfu)/ml calculated. Bacteria species were identified biochemically. ESBL-production was phenotypically confirmed using the MICRONAUT-S \u03b2-Lactamases system. Additionally, antimicrobial susceptibility was tested using VITEK \u00ae 2 technology. Phylotyping of E. coli isolates and screening for bla genes was performed by PCR. ESBLproducing enterobacteria were detected on all farms and 96.5% of calves investigated shed ESBL-positive bacteria. Of all ESBL-producing isolates, the majority were E. coli (92.9%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae (5.1%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (2.0%). The majority of E. coli isolates was clearly assigned to phylogroup C (25.0%), followed by phylogroups A (15.2%) and E (14.1%). CTX-M group 1 was most frequently detected (80.4%). E. cloacae contained bla CTX-M and bla TEM or bla SHV . K. pneumoniae harboured bla SHV only. Besides resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins, the majority of isolates was also resistant to one or more antibiotic classes, with a high proportion being resistant against fluoroqinolones. 52.5% of isolates were further characterised as threefold multidrug resistant gram-negative bacteria (3MDR-GNB) according to the German Commission for Hospital Hygiene and Infection Prevention. None of the isolates were 4MDR-GNB, i.e. none revealed carbapenem-resistance. Penicillins were the most frequently administered antibiotics to calves on most farms and were the predominant substance class at herd level on all farms. Overall, the number of calves treated prior to sampling was rather low (11.7%). Analyses of data regarding the farm management identified weaknesses in biosecurity and cleaning and disinfection. Besides beta-lactam antibiotics being the most commonly used antibiotics no other risk factors could be identified. In summary, the prevalence PLOS ONE PLOS ONE | https://doi.",

The farms kept a median of 781 (319-1701) milking cows and a median of 36 calves that were younger than two weeks. Calves were generally housed in individual pens or hutches for the first two weeks, either indoors (five farms) or outdoors (five farms). Calves on three farms were moved to group pens after 4-7 days. Waste milk was fed to the calves on seven of the ten farms. On one farm the milk was fed to all calves, on the remaining six farms only to bull calves. There was no data available on the proportion of waste milk containing antibiotic residues.",

During these visits an interview with the herd manager and an on-site inspection of the farm was carried out. The hygienic status of the farms was recorded and rated using a standardized questionnaire developed for dairy cattle [20] . The questions could either be answered with 'no' or 'yes' (translating to 0 or 3 scoring points) or in the fashion of 'not fulfilled', 'partially fulfilled' or 'fulfilled' (translating to 0, 1 or 3 scoring points). Weighted average ratios (in the following simply referred to as ratios) were calculated to describe the overall hygienic status on the farms as well as different aspects of dairy husbandry, such as biosecurity, feed and water hygiene, birth management and housing of cows and calves. Using scores between 0.00 to 3.00, the hygienic status of the farms was classified as poor (ratio 0.00-1.49, indicated by the colour red), medium (1.50-2.39, yellow) or good (2.40-3.00, green). Data on animal health and antimicrobial treatment were collected through animal scoring and the herd management program. The obtained information on AMU was collected in a database especially designed for this study and was further evaluated regarding gross amounts of used substances on herd level as well as for the different age groups.",

ESBL-producing enterobacteria were detected on all ten farms examined in the study. Of 200 faecal samples, 193 contained ESBL-producing enterobacteria which corresponded to a 96.5% prevalence of animals. This is much higher than reported in other studies performed in Germany, Switzerland, and Israel, which found an overall prevalence of 8.4%-56.2% and up to 26.2% in diseased calves [12, 13, 18, [26] [27] [28] . Major differences may relate to farm structures and farm practices, age of animals, and sampling on farms or at the slaughterhouse [12, 13, 28] . However, a similar amount (97.8%) of calves shedding ESBLproducers was found in the UK [13] . The highest prevalence of ESBL-E is usually found in young animals, notably suckling calves, which corresponds to our findings, but with increasing age ESBL-E prevalence gradually decreases [12, 13, 28, 29] . The average age of sampled calves in this study was 6.8 (\u00b13.9) days. In our study animals older than 14 days were not sampled.",

These included all 87 isolates from the first round of sampling as well as 13 isolates that were found on the first 3 farms during the second round of sampling. The majority were E. coli (92/100; 92.0%), followed by Enterobacter (E.) cloacae (5/100; 5.0%) and Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae (2/ 100; 2.0%). One isolate was an AmpC-producing Morganella morganae and thus excluded from the study. This distribution is in accordance to two studies from Switzerland which reported E. coli being the predominant ESBL-producing species in faeces from cattle, whereas ESBL-producing E. cloacae were found to a much lesser extent [12, 26] . The occurrence of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in cattle faeces has only recently been described [31] . Of all faecal samples investigated, three contained more than one of the above mentioned ESBL-producing species. The majority of E. coli isolates was clearly assigned to phylogroup C (23/92; 25.0%), followed by phylogroups A (14/92; 15.2%) and E (13/92; 14.1%). Phylogroups B1, D, and F were found less frequently with ten (10.9%), eight (8.7%) and six (6.5%) isolates, respectively. None of the isolates belonged to phylogroup B2. For 18 out of 92 (19.6%) E. coli the unambiguous assignment to either phylogroup A or C was not possible using the PCRs of Clermont et al. [25] . These isolates are therefore referred to as members of phylogroup A/C. Overall, isolates belonging to phylogroups C, A/C, and A were predominant. This distribution is in contrast to other studies where phylogroups A and B1 were dominantly found in ESBLE isolates from healthy animals [18, [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] . The main reason for the differences compared to other studies might be that the PCR-protocols used elsewhere may not discriminate between phylogroups A and C [18, 33, 35, 36] . However, differences in phylogroup distribution might also be attributed to geographic location, climate, feeding habits or other factors [37] .",

The majority of E. coli isolates (75/92, 81.5%) harboured bla CTX-M genes, with CTX-M group 1 predominating (80.4%). This is consistent with other German and European studies in which most frequently CTX-M group 1 followed by CTX-M group 9 were detected [13, 18, 27, 35, 38] . CTX-M group 9 was detected in five E. coli either as the only bla gene (n = 1) or in combination with other bla genes (n = 4). Only one isolate did not belong to either group 1 or 9. In 45 E. coli (48.9%), bla CTX-M was found in combination with bla TEM . Overall, the prevalence of bla TEM (61.9%) in E. coli either in combination with bla CTX-M or alone was higher compared to other studies [33, 39] . Four E. coli (4.3%) were negative for CTX-M, TEM, and SHV. Of the ESBL-producing E. cloacae and K. pneumoniae, one E. cloacae contained bla CTX-M and bla TEM whereas the remaining four and the two K. pneumoniae harboured bla SHV . Studies on EBSL-producing enterobacteria other than E. coli in animals are scarce. In contrast to our findings, bla SHV was the dominant gene in E. coli compared to K. pneumoniae in a recent South African study [31] . To the authors best knowledge there is only one report on E. cloacae carrying bla SHV and bla TEM isolated from a sheep lamb in Switzerland [27] .",

Acknowledging the One Health concept and the risk of bacterial transmission between animals and humans in either direction, data on the occurrence of these MDR bacteria are of high importance for public health and animal health risk assessment. Besides resistance to penicillins and cephalosporins, 60 ESBL-producing isolates (60.6%) were additionally resistant to one or more antibiotic classes as determined by VITEK 1 2 ( Table 2, S2 Table) which is in accordance to other studies in cattle [13, 27, 35, 41] and other food animals [27, 35, 42] . Concordant to Schmid et al. [13] and Eisenberger et al. [43] , a high proportion of isolates (46.5%) was also resistant to fluoroquinolones.

This finding was similar to results from ESBL-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolated from humans [46] . None of the isolates proved to be 4MDR-GNB, i.e. all were susceptible to imipenem and meropenem (Table 2) which is contrary to a study from the UK that reported an unstable imipenem-resistant phenotype in 1.2% of their E. coli isolates [41] . In Europe, screening for carbapenem-resistance in livestock is still underrepresented and prevalence in European countries was reported as <1% [47] . In Germany, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae were mainly associated with swine and chicken whereas only a single report on ertapenem-resistance in E. coli from a beef cattle farm is published [13, 47] . The gross amounts (in g) of antimicrobial substances administered on farm level are shown in S3 Table. In contrast to other European countries such as Denmark or The Netherlands, reporting of AMU in dairy calves is not mandatory in Germany according to current jurisdiction [48] . Therefore, the results presented here highly depended on the quality of documentation at farm level. Unfortunately, data regarding the use of antibiotics on one farm could not be evaluated due to inadequate documentation. Of 180 calves on the other farms, for which information on treatment was available, 21 (11.7%) received antibiotic treatment prior to sampling, four of which were treated twice. On two farms none of the sampled calves were treated before. Substances administered to calves and their corresponding indications are given in Table 3 . There was no correlation between the treatment of a calf with antibiotics and their status as ESBL-carrier (P = 0.7765).",

On herd level, penicillins were the predominant substance class on all farms. Similar results were reported for dairy herds in the UK [49] and cattle in Germany [50] . However, van Rennings et al. [50] did not differentiate between production type or age group. Fluoroquinolones were used on six farms which might account for the high amount of resistant isolates in our study. Cephalosporins were not administered to calves on any of the farms. A comparison of AMU among the participating farms regarding gross amounts of antibiotic substance was not possible because a reliable treatment index could not be calculated from the animal numbers obtainable through the herd management program.
