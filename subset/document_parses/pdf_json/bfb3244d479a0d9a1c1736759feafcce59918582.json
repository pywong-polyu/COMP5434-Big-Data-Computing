Asymptomatic patients are those who have positive test result for SARS-CoV-2 without symptom manifestation. A study by researchers at Johns Hopkins University showed that universal testing increased COVID-19 case detection by more than 200 percent in general as compared to targeted testing, and concluded that more testing resources are needed to curb the infection (3) . The study also summarized that unrecognized asymptomatic cases can hinder preventive strategies, as well as increase the risk of the virus spreading (3) . As pregnant women are also affected by coronavirus, this disease has drawn attention around the world, whether a universal testing policy should be imposed on all pregnant women who attend labor and admission units. In the United States, the National Institutes of Health categorized the disease severity into: asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe critical illness (4) . Knowledge regarding the capability of the virus to spread from an asymptomatic patient is still limited and poorly understood (5) . Liu et al. described two out of 15 cases of pregnant women who were asymptomatic at presentation and underwent testing in view of contact history, in whom pneumonic lesion of COVID-19 was identified upon computed tomography evaluation (6) . A study in an affiliated pair of New York City hospitals revealed 14 out of 43 (32.6%) pregnant women who were initially either asymptomatic and presented for obstetrically indicated labor induction, or remained asymptomatic upon presentation, and were subsequently identified to have positive COVID-19 infection upon universal testing at labor unit admission (7) . Such asymptomatic pregnant women are at higher risk of infecting their newborns upon birth, healthcare workers and other patients if they are not identified.",

In order for a test to be used for screening procedures in early disease detection, it should fulfill certain criteria such as validity, reliability, yield, cost, acceptance and follow-up services (9) . It is more desirable and cost-effective to conduct universal testing in a population where the prevalence is high (10) . This review therefore aims to look at reported prevalence rates of COVID-19 and thus explore the need for a universal testing policy for COVID-19 among pregnant women especially at the time of admission for delivery. It should be borne in mind that inadvertent exposure of healthcare workers to undiagnosed COVID-19 positive patients is an occupational hazard that comes with dire consequences, not only on the health and life of the worker, but also on healthcare services as a result of staff shortage due to quarantine and illness. Infection from an asymptomatic pregnant woman with COVID-19 infection who comes in labor in particular is a hazard to the healthcare worker that we should be seriously concerned about.",

It is notably found that the policy is adopted mostly in Western countries, as the implementation of the policy is highest in regions such as New York, Italy, Spain and Portugal. About two thirds (13,165/19,958 or 66.0%) of the population tested were from the United States, one of the countries with the highest number of population affected by the disease. From the total number of 19,958 pregnant women tested, an average of 5.3% were found to be infected. The total positive test rate ranged from 0.4 (12) to 27.0% (40) . We also found that 1.3% (260/19,958) of the total number of pregnant women presenting to labor and admission units were asymptomatic women who tested positive for COVID-19 infection. Out of the total number of positive tests for COVID-19, the proportion of asymptomatic pregnant women (75.5%) was markedly higher than symptomatic pregnant women (24.5%). Guidelines vary in terms of recommendation for testing for COVID-19 among pregnant women. The ACOG recommends universal testing in areas with high prevalence of the infection (46) .The guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research recommends universal testing of \"all pregnant women in/near labor who are hospitalized for delivery\" (47) . However, other guidelines may not state such a stand clearly (48) , and may rely on clinical screening as first line (49).",

Although prevalence varies across the globe and several vaccines have been successfully tested and now implemented, mutants of SARS-CoV-2 appear every so often, hence other preventive measures such as limiting contact and physical distancing still matters. It is good to note some move toward advocating universal testing of pregnant women attending labor and delivery units, given the recent spike in the prevalence of asymptomatic (46) . In a study by Bianco et al., universal screening using the telephone as a screening tool is inadequate as 24 patients who were previously not identified as likely to be COVID-19 positive via such screening, were tested positive from the universal testing (20) . Therefore, the findings of this systematic review implies that healthcare workers and other patients are at significant risk of exposure and getting infected with COVID-19, if universal testing of pregnant women is not implemented in high prevalence areas. The alternative measure is universal precaution i.e., wearing of personal protective equipment (PPE) when handling all cases. However, universal usage of PPE will result in wastage of a precious commodity that has been in short supply.",

The current compiled review is useful in planning preventive strategies in the interest of the health of pregnant mothers, their babies, and mitigating the risk of healthcare workers. In regions with low COVID-19 prevalence, the approach may be different. The research question on universal testing needs to be addressed carefully. The incubation period for COVID-19 is reported to be between 5 and 14 days and the duration of immunity is still being studied. For populations with low prevalence, using a screening checklist and restricting diagnostic testing only for those with positive screening may be a more cost-effective option. A cost-effectiveness study on universal testing is in order before universal testing can be recommended as a policy. The issue of timing of testing in relation to pregnancy and labor also needs to be considered and are not easy decision points.",

Although the majority of studies included are retrospective cohort studies, case reports and research letters that were retrieved are expected to have high risk of bias. Apart from that, we did not report the prevalence of COVID-19 in the general population in individual studies as they were likely to be underreported to various degrees, depending on the extent of mass testing in a particular population. As a result, we were not able to compare the prevalence of infected cases by different regions and countries. It is quite difficult to do this retrospectively for all locations as the local prevalence changes fairly rapidly and the studies were time-sensitive, several of them limiting the study period to 1 or 2 weeks only.",

Although the current trend of universal testing predominates only in developed countries, more studies involving developing and less developed countries should be conducted to provide valuable information of the need for such a policy of universal testing for COVID-19 in pregnancy. Universal testing provides benefits in areas with high prevalence of disease, hence testing for the background prevalence in representative samples of pregnant women in various regions should be considered in order to guide policy making. Above all, in areas with high prevalence of COVID-19, the strategy of universal testing of pregnant women before admitting them for delivery is essential and must be implemented rigorously in order to protect the women, their newborns, and in-contact healthcare workers so as to curb the spread of infection in the community.",
