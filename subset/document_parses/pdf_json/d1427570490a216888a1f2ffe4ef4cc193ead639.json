            "text": "Clot formation in HD circuits can result in complications such as blood loss and decreased efficiency of the dialysis units or failure. [1] Exposure of blood to artificial surfaces within the HD circuit or other life preserving devices activates factor XII, which initiates the contact-activation coagulation pathway. AB023, a humanized IgG4 antibody, binds to the A2 domain of Factor XI (FXI), thereby inhibiting the activation of FXI by FXII and hence the contact-activation pathway but does not interfere with thrombin-mediated FXI activation. A randomized phase-2 study enrolled 24 patients with ESRD on chronic HD to receive a single dose of AB023 (0.25 or 0.5 mg/kg) vs. placebo into the HD circuit at the start of heparin free HD. [2] The frequency of occlusive events requiring circuit exchange decreased by 68% in patients given 0.25 mg/kg and by 50% with 0.5 mg/ kg AB023, while it remained unchanged in the placebo arm. There was a significant decrease in the number of saline flushes required to maintain circuit patency (44% and 85% with 0.25 and 0.5 mg/kg respectively). The incidence of high-grade clotting in the hemodialyzer assessed by visual scoring also decreased in a dose-dependent manner. AB023 reduced thrombin generation as detected by thrombin antithrombin complexes measured four hours after dosing. No drug-related adverse events (AEs) were noted, including clinically relevant bleeding. The time to hemostasis at the HD access site did not change after AB023 administration.",

[8, 9] ICH is associated with high rates of mortality and disability but there is limited data on the clinical outcomes of patients with anticoagulant-associated ICH. A retrospective study analyzing the in-hospital mortality rate and functional outcomes of patients with anticoagulant associated intracranial hemorrhage was presented at ASH, 2020. [10] A total of 1331 patients were admitted with ICH, 195 were on an oral anticoagulant (77 DOAC and 118 warfarin), 258 on antiplatelet monotherapy and 835 were not on anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy preceding ICH. Patients on oral anticoagulant prior to ICH were older and the indication for anticoagulation was atrial fibrillation in majority of the patients (81.8% in DOACs and 73.7% in warfarin). Patients who were not on prior anticoagulant/antiplatelet therapy had longer length of admission and stay in intensive care and were also more likely to undergo operative intervention ( Table 2) . Subdural hematomas were more common in patients on warfarin while intraparenchymal bleed was more frequent with DOACs. The average in-hospital mortality was higher with an oral anticoagulant-associated ICH (37.7% with DOACs, 36.5% with warfarin) compared to 22.4% with antiplatelet monotherapy and 16.8% with no anticoagulant/ antiplatelet therapy. Among patients on DOACs, the inhospital mortality was 29% for those on apixaban (n = 31) and 46% for those on rivaroxaban (n = 39).

Manual whole blood clotting time (WBCT) was performed at multiple time-points over 24 h and reversal was defined by decrease in WBCT to \u2264 10% above baseline. Traditional plasma-based assays (like aPTT, PT, anti-Xa) could not be used since ciraparantag binds to reagents (citrate and EDTA) in test-tubes rather than the anticoagulant in blood. Ciraparantag demonstrated a rapid and dose-dependent reversal of both apixaban and rivaroxaban. For apixaban, mean WBCT reversal to \u2264 10% above baseline, at 15 min postinfusion, occurred with 60 and 120 mg ciraparntag while a higher dose of 180 mg ciraparantag was needed for rivaroxaban. Approximately 80% of patients who had received apixaban achieved reversal at 15 min with 60 mg ciraparantag, which increased to 100% at 60 min. For subjects who had received rivaroxaban, 180 mg ciraparantag lead to reversal in about 80% at 15 min, which increased to 100% at 30 min. The reversal was sustained at 5-6 h in both groups. The most common treatment emergent AEs were sensations of warmth (hot flashes, flushing) which occurred in 40% but were mild, transient and dose-related. Ciraparantag has several unique attributes in the current landscape of reversal agents. Being a small molecule rather than a biologic, it can be rapidly and easily administered and has the potential to be a universal reversal agent.",

It has been established that the rate of VTE in higher in patients hospitalized COVID-19 compared to non-COVID and patients with COVID-19 who develop a VTE have a higher mortality compared to those who did not have any thromboembolic complications. [15, 16] The risk of VTE varies based upon the severity of illness and a recent metaanalysis showed that the pooled VTE prevalence in non-ICU patients was 7.9% (95% CI 5.1-11.20) and in ICU patients was 22.7% (95% CI 18.1-27.6%).

The investigators found that Rothman Index on admission was an independent predictor of mortality in the entire cohort along with older age, male sex, obesity and D-dimer. Among patients in the anticoagulation cohort, in-hospital mortality of patients who received intermediate dose anticoagulation (n = 191) was compared to those who received prophylactic dose anticoagulation (n = 191). Intermediate dose anticoagulation was associated with a decrease in mortality [OR 0.52 (0.31-0.87), p = 0.013] compared to prophylactic dose. On comparing patients who received aspirin with those who did not (n = 319 in each), it was found that aspirin was associated with lower in-hospital mortality [OR 0.52 (0.34-0.81), p = 0.004].",

Severe thrombocytopenia is common in patients undergoing treatment for hematological malignancies. However, despite optimal prophylactic platelet transfusions, the rate of WHO grade-2 or higher bleeding is 43-70% (TOPSS trial and PLADO trial). Widespread endothelial damage in patients with hematological malignancies due to chemotherapy, GVHD and infections predisposes to clot formation. Usually when a clot is formed, platelets release a large amount of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1) which blocks the effect of tPA on plasminogen and stabilizes the blood clot. With thrombocytopenia, PAI-1 is not as abundant, leading to greater plasmin generation and faster clot degradation. Therefore, it was hypothesized that a fibrinolytic would efficacious in this setting. The American Trial Using Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in Thrombocytopenia (A-TREAT) was a phase 3, doubleblinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate whether prophylactic tranexamic acid along with routine platelet transfusions would impact the bleeding and transfusion requirement in patients undergoing therapy for hematological malignancies. [26] 330 patients who were undergoing therapy for hematological malignancies and expected to have a platelet count of < 10 k/\u00b5L for > 5 days were randomized. The mean age was 54.2 years (\u00b1 13.1), 128 patients underwent allotransplant, 72 underwent autologous transplant and 130 received chemo/immunotherapy. 165 patients received either intravenous (1000 mg) or oral (1300 mg) TXA and 165 received saline or placebo every 8 h beginning when the platelet count was \u2264 30 k/\u00b5L and was continued for 30-days or platelet recovery or a diagnosis of thrombosis. There was no significant difference in the proportion of grade 2 or higher bleeding (48.8% in placebo vs 45.4% in TXA-group, OR 0.86 (95% CI 0.52, 1.38; p value = 0.74)]. There was no significant difference in the mean number of transfusions [estimated difference 0.1 (95% CI \u2212 1.9, 2.0; p value = 0.94)] or average days alive without grade 2 or higher bleeding [average difference 0.1 (95% CI \u2212 1.4, 1.5; p value = 0.94)]. However, there was an increase in the incidence thrombotic events TXA arm (11.0% vs. 19.5%), most of which were central line occlusions. There was no increase in non-catheter thrombotic events.",

Mycophenolate (MMF) has been used as second-line treatment in some countries and is cheaper than most second-line treatment options. The FLIGHT trial evaluated whether addition of MMF to corticosteroids was better than the standard of care, corticosteroids alone, in patients with newly diagnosed ITP.

The corticosteroids included either dexamethasone 40 mg \u00d7 4 days or prednisone 1 mg/kg followed by taper. MMF was started at 500 mg BID with the option of escalating to 1000 mg BID, was continued for 6 months and then tapered.

Patients underwent myeloablative conditioning followed by infusion of CTX001. Results of the first 10 patients who had at least 3-month follow up was presented at ASH annual meeting 2020. Seven patients with TDT had a median age of 23 years (19) (20) (21) (22) (23) (24) (25) (26) and required a median of 33 units of RBCs/year (23-61). Post infusion, all patients demonstrated clinically meaningful elevation of total and fetal Hb and achieved transfusion independence. The median Hb 11.5 g/dL and the median fetal Hb was 8.4 g/dL in 7 patients who had a 3-month follow up and this response improved with time as demonstrated by transfusion independence in 1 patient at 21 months. There was pan-cellular expression of fetal Hb at 6 months with 99% circulating RBCs expressing HbF. Three patients with severe SCD with median age of 22 years had a median 7 VOEs in the past year (4-7.5). There was early and sustained improvement in total and fetal Hb. At last follow up (3.8-16.6 months), there were no episodes of VOEs, the fetal Hb ranged from 31 to 48% and total Hb 11.5-13.2.",
