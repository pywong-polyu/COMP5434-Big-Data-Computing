Tests were evaluated on recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein, cultured endemic and emerging coronaviruses, stored respiratory samples with known SARS-CoV-2 viral loads, stored samples from patients with respiratory pathogens other than SARS-CoV-2, and self-sampled swabs from healthy volunteers. We estimated analytical sensitivity in terms of approximate viral concentrations (quantified by real-time RT-PCR) that yielded positive AgPOCT results, and specificity in terms of propensity to generate false-positive results.",

            "text": "The ongoing SARS-CoV-2 pandemic continues to challenge public health systems worldwide. In the absence of global vaccine availability or effective drugs, virus detection by real-time RT-PCR (RT-rtPCR) has been widely adopted to enable non-pharmaceutical interventions based on case finding and contact tracing. Because of its high sensitivity and specificity, RT-rtPCR is the gold standard for SARS-CoV-2 detection. 1 RT-rtPCR is a laboratory-based procedure that requires sophisticated equipment, trained personnel, and logis tical planning for sample shipment and results communication. Timeliness of results is crucial for the control of onward transmission, due to shedding of infectious virus mainly occurring around the time of symptom onset. 2 However, delays in obtaining RT-rtPCR results are widespread, and they are compounded by the increasing demand for RT-rtPCR tests that are certified for in-vitro diagnostic application, which creates supply bottlenecks and a shortfall of overall testing capacity in many countries. 3 Antigen detection tests for the identification of SARS-CoV-2 infection are considered inferior to RT-rtPCR in terms of sensitivity and specificity. 4, 5 However, they offer the possibility of point-of-care testing, which can provide essential information when needed-an advantage that can offset the possibility, in some situations, of having to amend the information from an RT-rtPCR result obtained at a later point. As SARS-CoV-2 antigen pointof-care test (AgPOCT) devices are becoming available from various manufacturers, interest is growing in their performance, with particular regard to sensitivity and overall specificity, as two essential parameters that can guide decisions for application. 6 Because of the intense but short-lived nature of SARS-CoV-2 shedding from the upper respiratory tract, the clinical validation of AgPOCTs requires a focus on the timing of infection in studied patients. 7, 8 If patients are tested late in the course of infection, such as in the second week after symptom onset, incongruences between RT-rtPCR and AgPOCT will cause an apparently low clinical sensitivity of AgPOCTs that is not necessarily relevant to the use of these tests in diagnosing early acute infections. 9 In addition to the fraction of virus-positive patients detected by the test (clinical sensitivity), sensi tivity can also be expressed in terms of an antigen concentration limit, below which the capability of the test to detect an infected patient is lost (analytical sensitivity). From a practical perspective, knowledge of the analytical sensitivity rather than clinical sensitivity of AgPOCTs might be sufficient to judge their utility in various fields of application (eg, screening in outpatient departments and testing in the workplace or the general population), as compared with the well established reference method of RT-rtPCR. 10 In this study, we compared seven commercially available AgPOCT devices against an established RT-rtPCR assay, 11 with the aim of estimating analytical sensitivity and specificity.",

The limits of detection of most of the studied AgPOCTs approximate virus concentrations at which patients are infectious, justifying a reliable use in various areas of health care and public health, including decisions on immediate isolation measures. However, due to the lower sensitivity of AgPOCTs versus RT-rtPCR, they might not have the power to exclude SARS-CoV-2 infection in the very early and later phases of multiple sites in Berlin and north Germany, and were sent to our laboratory at the Institute of Virology for SARS-CoV-2 testing or confirmation. These samples were received in UTM, PBS, or without any medium. Due to anonymisation, we had no other inclusion or exclusion criteria than SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.

Dry swabs were suspended in PBS. Of each suspension, 50 \u00b5L was introduced into the recommended volume of lysis reagent for each AgPOCT. Notably, this procedure with swabs diluted in buffer introduces a predilution step (approximately 1:20) not normally applied in AgPOCT protocols, resulting in a loss of sensitivity as opposed to RT-rtPCR. However, the swabs used for this study were standard-gauge flocked swabs that are not provided with the AgPOCTs. The swabs provided with the AgPOCTs consist of the same material but are considerably thinner and thus carry less sample volume. To estimate the relative sample input in the present procedure, we inserted standard flocked swabs and the swabs included in the AgPOCT kits in a solution of 50% sucrose and determined the relative sample volume contained in each swab by weighing the swabs. The resulting relative sample volume on AgPOCT swabs was around 40% (range 10-90%) of that in standard-gauge swabs. Taking our predilution step into account, this results in an approximately 8-fold lesser sample input in AgPOCT in the present study, as opposed to direct application as per manufacturer's instructions. This factor should be accounted for when directly comparing against the RT-rtPCR process and sensitivity herein. Also noteworthy is that the observable variability of swabs in some AgPOCT assays is considerable.",

He and colleagues 25 have shown that this point in time also correlates with the end of the period during which infected individuals can transmit the virus. Although many caveats remain, the point in the course of the first week of symptoms at which AgPOCT results turn negative might thus indicate the time at which infectivity resolves. 29 The immediate availability of test results could enable novel public health concepts in which decisions to isolate or maintain isolation are based on infectivity testing rather than infection screening. On first patient contact, a positive AgPOCT result could also help to decide on immediate isolation measures by the identification of individuals who shed particularly large amounts of virus, which would be particularly useful in emergency departments. 30 In hospitalised patients at the end of their clinical course, AgPOCT results might provide an additional criterion to maintain or modify isolation precautions.",

In case of discrepant evaluations, a third person was consulted to reach a final decision (VMC, TB, or MLS). In case of test failure indicated by absence of a visible positive control band, the test procedure was repeated on the same sample.Initial comparisons of analytical sensitivity relied on purified, bacterially expressed viral nucleocapsid protein (the target protein of all AgPOCTs).
