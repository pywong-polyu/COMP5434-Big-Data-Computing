However, it became quickly apparent that apart from the lungs multiple other organs could be compromised and therefore the concept that COVID-19 is a viral sepsis with an ensuing systemic inflammatory syndrome affecting the entire body became widely accepted [1] .",

However, some features are distinct from sepsis-associated hemostatic changes, so that it is usually referred to as \"COVID-19-associated coagulopathy\" [8] . COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is typically associated with highly elevated D-dimer levels, which are strong predictors for This article is published as part of a supplement sponsored by the International Conference on Thrombosis and Hemostasis Issues in Cancer. a more severe clinical course and an adverse outcome as well as for venous thromboembolism. Of note, D-dimer levels can also be increased in patients with cancer but the D-dimer elevation is frequently more profound in patients with severe COVID-19. Other characteristics are elevated plasma concentrations of fibrinogen and factor VIII, likely as a result of the acute phase response driven by pro-inflammatory cytokines, notably interleukin (IL)-6 [9] . Many patients have a mild thrombocytopenia (100-150 \u00d7 10 9 /l) whereas more reduced platelet counts are rarely (<5%) seen [10] . However, thrombocytopenia is a marker for a higher risk of severe disease. A meta-analysis indicated that a drop in platelet count of 30 \u00d7 10 9 /l in COVID-19 patients or thrombocytopenia below the lower limit of normal was associated with a more than five-fold higher risk of severe disease [11] . Plasma levels of physiological coagulation inhibitors such as antithrombin and protein C can be mildly decreased, in particular in non-surviving patients, but these concentrations rarely decline below 80% of normal [4, 12] . Several studies have reported abnormal overall clotting and increased viscoelastic parameters by thrombelastography [13] . Overt DIC is infrequently seen in COVID-19 infection except for some critically ill patients with multi-organ failure [14] .",

Coronavirus infections are associated with a typical fibrinolytic profile. Experiments in mice with a targeted deletion of the urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) gene pointed to a urokinase-driven route as an important factor in mortality [15] . Also, in human SARS-CoV-1 infection plasma levels of tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) were 6-fold higher than normal [16] . It may be hypothesized that the marked release of plasminogen activators from the endothelium plays a role in the high levels of D-dimer that is seen in severe COVID-19. One can speculate that the resulting plasmin activates metalloproteinases that are involved in extracellular matrix modification required for capillary leakage and lung edema.",

Inducers of NET formation include IL-8 and complement activation, both of which are key aspects of COVID-19 [17] . These intravascular NETs promote thrombus formation by triggering activation of the intrinsic coagulation pathway and by providing a scaffold for platelets, red blood cells, and procoagulant molecules such as von Willebrand factor. Markers for NETosis, such as myeloperoxidase-DNA complex and citrullinated histone H3, appear to be higher in patients with COVID-19 than in controls, but are also higher in patients with severe COVID-19 than in those with mild COVID-19, suggesting a role for NETs in mediating disease severity. For example, it was shown that citrullinated histone H3 positive neutrophils (indicative of neutrophils displaying NET formation) colocalize with platelets within microthrombi present in the lungs of patients with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome [18] . NETs were also abundant in coronary thrombi of patients who developed myocardial infarction in relation to COVID-19, while atherosclerotic plaques were absent. Together, these findings demonstrate that NETosis is common in patients with COVID-19 and may be one of the drivers of COVID-19 coagulopathy.",

It may also may cause augmented platelet-vessel wall interaction, as a result of the massive release of high molecular weight von Willebrand factor multimers from injured endothelium, which will overwhelm the cleaving capacity of ADAMTS13, and cause thrombotic microangiopathy in the microvasculature of various organs [21, 22] .",

Immobilisation, indwelling lines in hospitalized patients and vascular damage further increase the risk of thrombosis. A pooled analysis of clinical observational studies in more than 2000 patients suggested an incidence of venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in about 30% in patients with severe COVID-19 [23, 24] . A meta-analysis estimated the incidence of venous thromboembolism at 18% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, growing to 28% in patients admitted to critical care units [25] . Some retrospective studies indicated an even higher risk of venous thromboembolism in those with more severe COVID-19 coagulopathy. There is quite some variation between the reported incidences in individual studies which probably can be ascribed to including nonsymptomatic diagnoses (obtained by systematic screening) in the cohorts and variable use of antithrombotic prophylaxis. The relevance of (microvascular) thrombosis for organ dysfunction has also been suggested based on post-mortem pathological reports. Several reports demonstrated vascular changes, including wall thickening, vessel stenosis, and microthrombi formation associated with multiple organ failure and acute lung injury [26] .",

A retrospective study compared 2779 patients with COVID-19 complicated by venous thromboembolism in 16 centers in China with 23,000 non-COVID-19 medical inpatients. Overall, mild and severe COVID-19 increased the risk of developing symptomatic venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism by a factor 3 and 6, respectively [40] . In this study active cancer was the most prominent risk factor for developing thrombosis in patients with COVID-19. In a study in 2804 hospitalized COVID-19 patients with cancer the incidence of venous thromboembolism was higher (10%) in patients receiving recent anti-cancer therapy than in those without treatment (6%). Other risk factors for venous thromboembolism in cancer and COVID-19 were cancers with a known high risk of thrombosis (such as pancreatic or gastric cancer), previous thrombosis, ICU triage on admission, ethnicity, and significant D-dimer elevation [41] . There are also some reports of smaller studies suggesting that the thrombotic risk associated with COVID-19 is not additive to the risk of thrombosis in cancer patients. One study in 45 cancer patients with COVID-19, calculated an incidence of 14% of thrombosis in the cancer group compared with 18% in a noncancer control group. However cancer patients were more often on therapeutic dose anticoagulants than controls in this study. Of note survival was significantly shorter in the group with active cancer compared to non-cancer patients [42] .",

The ATTACC, ACTIV-4a and REMAP-CAP investigators evaluated the efficacy and safety of therapeutic-dose anticoagulation in an open-label adaptive multiplatform RCT [44, 45] . They found no benefit on a primary outcome of organ support-free days and death and a higher bleeding risk in patients on the intensive care unit but a better outcome (and only slightly more bleeding) in hospitalized non-intensive care patients. In the recent RAPID trial therapeutic dose low molecular weight heparin did not significantly lower the composite risk of death, invasive mechanical ventilation, or admission to the intensive care unit (primary outcome) in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, but was associated with a significantly lower chance of death (1.8% versus 7.6%; odds ratio 0.22) [46] . The INSPIRATION trial randomized severe COVID-19 patients to either intermediate-dose (1 mg/kg enoxaparin daily) or standard-dose (40 mg enoxaparin daily) thromboprophylaxis in critically ill patients with COVID-19 [47] . Among the 562 patients included in the primary analysis, there was no significant difference between the two groups. Similarly, full dose rivaroxaban was not associated with better outcomes than standard-dose heparin in patients hospitalized with COVID-19 and elevated D-dimer concentrations [48] . Taken together, whereas there is increasing evidence that higher intensity thrombosis prophylaxis is somewhat more effective and only slightly less safe compared to conventional dose prophylaxis in hospitalized patients with COVID-19, clinical studies do not support higher doses of antithrombotic prophylaxis in more severely ill patients, mostly because of an enhanced risk of bleeding in more severely ill patients. One could argue this finding could be extrapolated to cancer patients who also have an increased bleeding risk.",

The recent ACTIV-4b randomized controlled trial compared prophylactic-dose apixaban, therapeutic-dose apixaban, aspirin, placebo in clinically stable outpatients with COVID-19 [49] . There was no difference in outcomes between the four arms, although the study was largely underpowered as it was terminated early after enrolment of 657 because of a lower-than-anticipated event rate. However, the risk benefit balance for cancer patients may tip in favour of (conventional dose) thrombosis prophylaxis for outpatients during an active COVID-19 infection but this needs confirmation in appropriate clinical studies.",
