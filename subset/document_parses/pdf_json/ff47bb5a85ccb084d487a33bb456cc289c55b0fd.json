Aims To discuss how the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic affected the health management of NCD patients, identify which aspects should be carried forward into future NCD management, and propose collaborative efforts among public-private institutions to effectively shape NCD care models. Methods The NCD Partnership, a collaboration between Upjohn and the European Innovation Partnership on Active and Healthy Ageing, held a virtual Advisory Board in July 2020 with multiple stakeholders; healthcare professionals (HCPs), policymakers, researchers, patient and informal carer advocacy groups, patient empowerment organizations, and industry experts.",

Conclusions Multistakeholder partnerships can promote swift changes to NCD prevention and patient care. Intra-and intercommunication between all stakeholders should be facilitated involving all players in the development of clinical guidelines and digital health tools, health and social care restructuring, and patient support in the short-, medium-and long-term future.",

            "text": "Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) account for more than half of the global burden of disease and are a major cause of mortality [1, 2] . In a recent report, the NCD Countdown 2030 collaborators highlighted that health policies that target reductions in blood pressure, smoking, and alcohol use are needed to substantially reduce NCD mortality [1] . Reducing premature mortality from the four major NCDs (cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes) by one-third is estimated to have substantial effects on longevity [3] . In addition, equitable access to high-quality, effective prevention and treatment for acute and chronic NCDs is required [1] . Prevention of NCDs, as well as the management of NCD patients' symptoms and disease, are both relevant for preventing negative outcomes associated with chronic disorders, including dependency, disability, mortality, and healthcare costs. However, the control policies for COVID-19 have already disrupted screening, diagnosis, treatment, and surveillance of NCD patients [4] . Thus, the COVID-19 pandemic has triggered multiple problems for individuals with NCDs and their informal carers. First, people with preexisting NCDs are more likely to suffer severe consequences of COVID-19, including a higher risk of hospitalization, complications, and mortality [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Second, the infection-control measures led to difficulties in accessing adequate treatment, medication, and care for NCDs, e.g., non-urgent outpatient visits were cancelled due to the risk of SAR-CoV-2 infection to patients and healthcare providers (HCPs), care avoidance due to fear of infection [10] , and resources were reallocated for testing and treatment of COVID-19. The reduction of outpatient services has important treatment implications for patients who have preexisting NCD diagnoses and the family members who may provide unpaid care to them at home (informal carers), and it also affects prevention, screening, and diagnosis of new NCD cases. For example, a US study on screening and control of diabetes and dyslipidemia reported changes in outpatient services during February and March 2020, specifically an 81-90% fall in the rate of testing (LDL cholesterol and HbA1c testing) and a 52-60% drop in new medication therapy (statin and metformin therapy) [11] while another study reported a significant increase in severe diabetes foot complications such as amputations during the pandemic, which may affect quality of life, mortality, and morbidity [12] . Finally, HCPs were often unprepared to cope with this unprecedented health emergency, especially the remote monitoring of NCD patients, which may lead to inequalities in NCD care between patients according to setting, country, and type of disorder.",

The pandemic is still ongoing, and some countries have already started new phases of lockdown and strict social distancing to cope with an increase in COVID-19 cases. Future waves are also likely to regularly reoccur while vaccine programs are ongoing. Therefore, there is a need to reshape and transform NCD care in the context of resilient and sustainable health and social systems both in the long-term (post-pandemic periods) and in the medium-term (when new waves of COVID-19 might lead to new lockdowns or shielding initiatives for NCD patients). This is also relevant for other emergency situations such as future natural disasters and other pandemics. Despite many difficulties, the COVID-19 emergency has generated a momentum in the collaborative approaches among public and private institutions to identify and implement effective therapeutic approaches for NCD patients. Multistakeholder collaborations bring together the public sector (e.g., policymakers, HCPs, researcher institutes), the private sector (e.g., industry, pharmaceutical companies, etc.), and civil society (e.g., community groups, patient and carer advocacy organizations etc.). All stakeholders have varying roles and capabilities that can be utilized to provide a comprehensive response to NCDs, which is important due to the multisectoral nature of NCDs [13, 14] .",

It involves a collaboration between Upjohn and the European Innovation Partnership (EIP) on Active and Health Ageing (AHA) and unites multiple stakeholders including HCPs, policymakers, researchers, patient and carer advocacy groups, patient empowerment organizations, and industry experts. The NCD Partnership was formed in 2021 at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and on 7-8 th July 2020, Upjohn hosted a virtual conference to identify barriers and challenges to NCD management during the COVID-19 pandemic. The current article provides output from the roundtable discussion and represents the perspectives of multiple stakeholders. The congress was held in the summer of 2020 and reflects the experts' opinions based on their experience of the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic, specifically during peak periods. Table 1 depicts the main findings of the Advisory Board, in terms of issues and barriers faced by NCD patients and HCPs as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, possible solutions for the future, and the role that multistakeholder partnerships can play, as described in more detail below.

Existing NCD protocols were understandably not developed for the care environment that arose during the pandemic, where non-urgent, face-to-face consultations were cancelled. As the pandemic is a novel, worldwide phenomenon that has never been faced before, there was inadequate scientific information available for HCPs on how to manage NCDs and non-acute patients during the pandemic. Many HCPs were restricted in methods to communicate with patients and collaborate with their colleagues. Due to a lack of readiness and regulations on digital health solutions, discussed later, many HCPs tried to find solutions to deal with patients remotely using phone or video calls. Further, there were no clear strategies for managing individuals living in long-term care facilities early on in the pandemic, and the mortality risk of residents was up to four times higher during the pandemic compared to the previous years [15] . People residing in these facilities are often old, frail, and suffer from multiple chronic NCDs but during the first wave of the pandemic, they were often unable to leave the facilities to receive care in specialized settings. Consequently, onsite HCPs and GPs took an increasing role in managing residents' NCDs, and support staff in these facilities took on an increasingly larger role in NCD care. Further, some persons living in the community were hesitant to visit hospitals even if they needed medical attention due to fear of infection [10] .",

This could include adapting current disease-specific guidelines so that they contain recommendations focusing on the different scenarios that are likely to occur in the near future including (i) periods of lockdown when non-urgent NCD care is scaled back; (ii) intervals when strict lockdowns have been eased but there is still a risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, when NCD patients might be recommended to shield or reduce face-to-face contact with others and; (iii) future periods when rates of SARS-CoV-2 reduce if vaccination programmes are successful long-term on a large scale. It is important to also consider that such guidelines will be based on current knowledge and that the pandemic has hampered many research activities on NCDs (e.g., due to reallocation of resources, delays in ethical review, halting of non-COVID-19 research projects etc.).",

Multistakeholder partnerships can play a vital role in achieving the above-mentioned goals. First, they can provide common platforms for policymakers and HCPs to work together to provide practical, timely guidelines, through virtual conferences, advisory boards, and working groups. These events can be used to collect the perspectives of multiple stakeholders and promote opportunities for collaborative research partnerships. Further, they can support the development of guidelines co-written by multiple stakeholders through unconditional, independent financial support. An essential element of multistakeholder partnerships is the unique prospects for researchers and HCPs to collaborate with patient advocacy groups and policymakers to ensure that every perspective is heard and to help facilitate the harmonization and dissemination of scientific evidence through structured collaboration and consistent dissemination programs.",

This is likely to have had important implications for integrated care. Integrated care is an essential strategy in chronic care models [16] [17] [18] and a crucial part of management for complex NCD patients, especially older patients and those with multimorbidity [17] . It involves coordinated, collaborative care from different administrative, organizational, service delivery, and clinical levels, to ensure comprehensive and multidimensional treatment and care to patients. For patients with multimorbidity, regular comprehensive assessment from a multidisciplinary, coordinated team is a recommended approach [17, 19] but it is likely that this component was greatly disrupted during the COVID-19 pandemic. It is also important to consider the needs of informal carers in these assessments in order to prevent exhaustion, negative health and social outcomes on their part as well as low-quality daily care. Many specialized care services were cancelled and, due to the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection, it is likely that patients with multimorbidity will have missed important assessments to track the progression of their NCD symptoms and disorders. Patients with new-onset multimorbidity are unlikely to have undergone comprehensive assessments to help stratify their medical and care needs, which is recommended [17] . Further, health services, especially geriatric and infectious disease specialties, were overwhelmed during the peak of the pandemic, and many specialist geriatric wards were converted into dedicated COVID-19 treatment centers. The long-term implications that these changes had on the integrated care of NCD patients is yet to be seen.",

            "text": "The Advisory Board members proposed numerous solutions for reshaping integrated care processes in the future. First, in the ongoing waves of the pandemic, the system needs to be reshaped by decentralizing care and shifting more NCD care into the community, with a focus on both short-and long-term solutions. It was also recommended that there should be more focus on patient self-support, aided by HCPs and informal carers. Indeed, one of the cornerstones of some integrated care models is the training of HCPs to tailor self-management support based on patient preferences and competencies and providing options for patients and families to improve self-management [17] . Therefore, a temporary shift that puts more emphasis on these components of integrated care models might help to compensate for the reduction in hospital-based NCD management during the pandemic. Similarly, other essential components of integrated care such as the use of patient-operated technology allowing patients to send information to their HCPs [17] and self-manage their disease and symptoms may need to be prioritized. However, as discussed later, patient preferences, regulations, and reimbursement for digital health solutions need to be considered. EU Institutions and Member States should also recognize and support (for instance, promoting the adoption of a common legislative framework, in the context of the European Pillar of Social Rights) the value of formal and informal care, that involves a multitude of complex activities provided also by non-professional carers. Further, it was emphasized that there needs to be an increase in the use of \"case managers\" or \"care coordinators\" (e.g., persons allocated as the active coordinator of care for an individual patient). Case managers need specific extra training to help NCD patients and their carers access reliable health information, care services, and NCD support during the pandemic. Case managers could become the point-ofcall for older NCD patients, in terms of directing them to trusted healthcare information resources and supporting selfcare and access to digital health solutions.",

The pandemic created an urgent need for coordinated mechanisms to respond to the outbreak across health sectors; digital health solutions may be promising approaches to address this challenge. A major problem was that these solutions were often not standardized and largely unregulated. Many European countries did not have sophisticated telehealth systems in place, although there were large differences between countries. Importantly, there were no clear policies regarding which type of patient should receive digital health solutions or who should be prioritized. Unclarity over billing, costs, and incentives for using digital health services were also relevant. Concerns over privacy and confidentially arose among patients and HCPs. Further, many HCPs, patients, and informal carers were unprepared to use many digital health solutions because they lacked training or experience. There were also inequalities in access to technological solutions. For example, some patients such as those with cognitive or sensory impairment may have had difficulties in using some tools.",
