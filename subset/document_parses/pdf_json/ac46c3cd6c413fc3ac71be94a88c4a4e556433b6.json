These benefits are achieved while preserving the integrity and validity of the trial, through the pre-specification and proper adjustment for the possible alterations during the course of the trial. Despite much research in the statistical literature highlighting the potential advantages of adaptive designs over traditional fixed designs, the uptake of such methods in clinical research has been slow. One major reason for this is that different adaptations to trial designs, as well as their advantages and limitations, remain unfamiliar to large parts of the clinical community. The aim of this paper is to clarify where adaptive designs can be used to address specific questions of scientific interest; we introduce the main features of adaptive designs and commonly used terminology, highlighting their utility and pitfalls, and illustrate their use through case studies of adaptive trials ranging from early-phase dose escalation to confirmatory Phase III studies.",

            "text": "In a traditional clinical trial the design is fixed in advance and the study then carried out as planned with the data being analysed after completion [1] as illustrated in Figure 1a . Such a trial design is routine in clinical research, but clearly inflexible whenever modifications of the planned trial conduct become desirable or necessary unless a protocol amendment is made. In contrast, adaptive designs preplan possible modifications on the basis of the data accumulating over the course of the trial. Aspects of a trial that can be modified include: the sample size, the number of treatment arms, or the allocation ratio to different arms. With these modifications pre-planned as part of an adaptive design, these changes can be made without requiring a protocol amendment. Typically these modifications are made based on data available within the study. It is adaptations of this nature that we consider here, while we do not consider options such as stopping early due to failure to meet operational criteria or excessive safety events; although adaptive designs for some of these do also exist [2] . Adaptations to a trial in progress are made using pre-planned interim analyses [3] . The defining characteristic of all adaptive designs we discuss in this work is the use of pre-planned interim analyses to decide if a pre-planned modification of the ongoing trial should be undertaken, without undermining its integrity and validity [4] . This is crucial: the integrity of a trial relates to the trial data and a guarantee that the data have not been used in such a way as to substantially alter the result, while the validity of the results requires that the study answers the original research questions appropriately. In an adaptive design, data are looked at more often than in a traditional study, thus the trial requires further procedures to ensure that data is collected, analysed, and stored in an appropriate manner at every stage of the trial. To ensure the validity of an adaptive design, specialised statistical methodology is required for inference; for example, to provide correct p-values, unbiased estimates, and confidence intervals for the treatment comparison(s). By their nature adaptive designs are more complex than their fixed sampling counterparts and this should be reflected in the reporting [5] .",

Furthermore, seamless designs make use of adaptive methods that allow for smooth and speedy transitions between trials of different phases [6] [7] [8] [9] .",

It is often possible to extend beyond classical statistical techniques and consider the use of a Bayesian methodology in the decision making process. Bayesian methods allow the incorporation of prior information (such as the current state of knowledge based on a review of the literature or expert opinion) into the design and analysis of a trial, provide more intuitive interpretation, and offer many other benefits [10] . Thus they fit naturally within the setting of adaptive designs.",

Despite the many clear benefits, adaptive designs are still far from established as typical practice [13] [14] [15] . Many reasons for this have been identified [14] [15] [16] [17] the main of which include: lack of expertise and experience (specific to the use of a suitable adaptive design); lack of software to assist in design and analysis; longer time required for planning and analysis of the trial; inadequate funding structure to account for uncertainty about how the trial will run; and the fact that chief investigators may insist on using a particular method they are comfortable with. We believe that, besides their knowledge of previous studies in the area or their own past experience with traditional designs, the main reason why investigators are not inclined to adopt adaptive designs is a lack of clarity among clinicians and trialists about what these are and what they can (and cannot) accomplish. Ambiguous terminology with vague definitions adds to any confusion [18] . To address this ambiguity, we provide a glossary of the most common types of adaptive design in Table 1 .",

The data collected are then used to select a dose for further testing in larger Phase II trials, in which the primary objective is to establish the potential efficacy of the treatment. In many therapeutic areas, the goal of a Phase I trial is to identify the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), that is the highest dose that controls the risk of unacceptable side effects [19] and hence is deemed safe. In practice, one seeks to identify the dose at which the probability of a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is equal to some pre-specified target level, usually around 20-33%. In oncology, this is usually done by treating consenting patients sequentially at increasing doses until too high a proportion of unacceptable side effects are observed. Several approaches have been proposed for conducting Phase I dose-escalation studies; we provide a summary of the most common of these approaches here and show examples of the corresponding adaptive designs being used in practice.",

Based on the number of DLTs observed in the current cohort of patients, recommendations are made to dose the next three patients at either the next escalating dose or the current dose. Extending upon the original 3+3 design a third option of reducing the dose below the current level may be included. Upon observing excessive toxicity at a dose level (say DLTs in more than 2 in 6 patients), the trial is terminated and the dose level below is considered to be the MTD. A simple illustration of this rule is shown in Figure 2 .

Rather than counting how many people have had DLTs at each dose to determine whether to dose-escalate or not, all available trial data (and possibly relevant prior information on the safety profile of the treatment) are used to estimate the probability of a DLT at each dose level. For a target toxicity level of interest, the dose for the next patient or cohort is either that with an estimated probability of DLT closest to the target level, or the highest available dose below the target level. This process is iterated for each new cohort of patients, as illustrated in Figure 3 . Example: Paoletti et al. [29] describe the design, conduct and analysis of a multicentre Phase I trial to find the MTD (defined as the dose with probability of a DLT closest to 20%) of rViscumin in patients with solid tumours. A DLT was defined as any haematological grade 4 or non-haematological grade 3 or grade 4 adverse event as defined by the National Cancer Institutes Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI CTCAE) Version 2, with the exclusion of nausea, vomiting, or rapidly controllable fever. The starting dose of the trial was 10 ng/kg, with fixed dose levels for further exploration of 20, 40, 100, 200, 400, 800 ng/kg; if no adverse events of grade 2 or higher were observed after escalation to 800 ng/kg, additional doses would be added in increments of 800 ng/kg (i.e. 1600, 2400, etc ng/kg).",

For example, a decision was made to dose another patient at 3200 ng/kg rather than escalate to 4000 ng/kg as per the design in order to gather more PK data at this level.

This requires close collaboration between the clinical team and a suitably trained statistician who is able to guide this optimisation process; although this opportunity to consider the study more carefully before it begins can only be a good thing for the study on the whole. The clinical team may still see the CRM as a \"black box\"; to resolve this concern, Dose Transition Pathways provide a tool for visualisation of the CRM escalation/de-escalation decisions [60] , which can assist in the communication of the design. Several computer programs are available (see MD Anderson Cancer Center software library [61] , Vanderbilt University, and packages within R [62, 63] ) for conducting simulation studies, some of which can offer comparisons to other popular dose escalation designs including the 3+3 design [63] and tutorial papers are available offering further guidance [30] .

Firstly, rather than choosing the next patient's dose as the estimated DLT probability closest to the target level, the EWOC approach assigns the next patient using a skewed allocation criterion to account for the fact that the overdosing of patients is much more undesirable compared to the underdosing. This results in a much more conservative patient allocation approach, with fewer patients being exposed to possible overdosing and experiencing a DLT compared to the CRM, while still benefiting from the model attempting to allocate the patients near the MTD [68, 69] . Secondly, the same statistical model is re-expressed in a way that allows focus on the clinically relevant parameters, the MTD, and the probability of a DLT at the lowest dose. This means that prior information about the treatment being investigated can easily be incorporated and one can visualise how the distribution of the MTD changes over the course of the trial.",

A Bayesian EWOC approach was used to govern dose-escalation, allocating the next patient to the largest dose with an estimated probability of less than 25% that the risk of a DLT exceeds 33%. In total, 19 patients were recruited to the trial: three patients received doses of 300 mg, 6 patients received doses of 450 mg, four patients received doses of 600 mg and six patients received doses of 750 mg. Two patients experienced DLTs, one at 600 mg and the other at 750 mg. At the end of the trial, the MTD was chosen as 750 mg; the largest dose at which the estimated probability of the risk of a DLT exceeding 33% was less than the target 25% (the probability was 7.3% for the chosen dose). Although the aim of the trial was not to evaluate efficacy of ceritinib in this population, 10 patients achieved partial responses to their cancers.",

Furthermore, the escalation control threshold can be altered depending on the trial context, and may change during the conduct of the trial [68, 69] ; this offers a conservative doseescalation schema at the start of the trial when there is little data available, but as more data are accrued, dose-escalation gradually becomes less conservative, and the MTD can be targeted more quickly than with the standard EWOC approach [68, 69, 74] .",

For example, choice of the MTD estimator needs to be considered; several trials use the same criterion as that by Nishio et al. [70] , i.e. the MTD is the dose that would be given to a new patient had they entered a trial, whereas others have used the posterior median of the MTD distribution. The implications of each choice need to be considered well in advance [75] . Furthermore, if the investigators plan to relax the escalation control mechanism (that is, decrease how cautious escalation is as the trial continues), as has been done in practice before [69, 76, 77] , the implications of this decision need to be considered. The EWOC approach may recommend to escalate the dose even when the most recently evaluated patient experienced a DLT [78] .",

We have discussed two approaches here for brevity, though many other alternatives have also been proposed, including designs based on optimal design theory [89] [90] [91] [92] and model-free designs [93] [94] [95] [96] , without the shortcomings of common rule-based designs like 3+3.

The methods we explore are typically considered for use in Phase II of the development process, where we wish to select a treatment or dose for further study. A common theme is to compare multiple arms against a common control. We explore methods that seek to remove less beneficial treatments from the trial quickly, giving patients a better chance of receiving an efficacious treatment. In addition model-based approaches allow modelling of the dose-response relationship in order to provide a deeper understanding of this in an efficient way. This is useful in trials where the different arms correspond to a series of exposure levels (such as doses of a drug, duration or intensity of radiotherapy, or number of therapy sessions).",

The MAMS approach has a variable sample size depending on which decisions are made through the trial, which will make planning more cumbersome, although the possible pathways are pre-defined; this is more variable than is typical of even other adaptive designs because decisions relate to each treatment individually.",

Regardless of how these probabilities are defined and applied for a specific adaptation rule, they can be also used to define further adaptations to the trial depending on the values they assume. For example, if the allocation probability goes below or rises above a certain value, arms can be dropped for futility or selected in a similar way to a MAMS study [120, 121] .

The trial used a Bayesian RAR design along the lines proposed by Thompson [117] . Thirty-four patients were recruited and randomised to one of the three arms. Initially an equal chance for randomisation to each arm was ensured, but treatment arms with a higher success rate, defined as the proportion of patients having complete remission within 49 days of starting treatment, would receive a greater proportion of patients. The randomisation probabilities were updated after every patient. The design would drop arms if their assignment probabilities became too low or promote them to Phase III if their assignment probability was high enough. The probability of a patient being randomised to the control arm was fixed until the first experimental arm was dropped.

Logistics of trial conduct is a noticeable obstacle in RAR due to the constantly changing randomisation [133] ; requiring more complex randomisation systems which in turn may impact things such as drug supply and manufacture. When the main advantage pursued is patient benefit, this may compromise other characteristics of the design; for example in a two-arm trial RAR designs will require larger sample sizes than a traditional fixed design with equal sample sizes in both arms; methods to account for such compromise have been proposed [125, 134] .",

At the planning stage, the set of possible models for the relationship between dose and response are defined, such as those shown in Figure 6 . The inclusion of several models addresses the issue of some of the models being potentially mis-specified. At the trial stage, the MCP step checks whether there is any dose-response signal. This is done through hypothesis tests for each model while adjusting for the fact that there are multiple candidate models. This ensures control of the probability of making incorrect claims of a dose-response signal (a type I error). If no models are found to be significant, it is concluded that the dose-response signal cannot be detected given the observed data. Once the dose-response signal is established, a single model is selected, or if multiple models are selected, an average over these models is made. The selection of models can be based either on tests performed at the MCP step or on some other measures such as the Akaike Information Criterion [141] (a measure of fit of statistical models). The selected model is then used to determine the dose to be tested in the subsequent trial. We refer the reader to the works focusing on the step-by-step application of MCP-Mod in practice [138, 142] .",

Some CARA procedures are designed to minimise imbalances on important covariates only [151, 152] (rather than giving the best treatment for a given patient) while other methods have an efficiency goal, being designed to minimise the variance of the treatment effect in the presence of covariates (i.e. to maximise statistical power) [155] .

A conventional aim at this stage of development is to be efficient, both in terms of the time that is required to conduct the trial and the number of patients we must recruit; the methods that follow attempt to make the trial more efficient while also ensuring that the overall probability of a successful outcome is maintained or increased. Methods aiming to be efficient in recruiting the correct number of patients have both an operational and ethical benefit; ensuring patients are not subject to an experimental treatment for a trial that is underpowered (i.e. has a low chance of detecting a meaningful effect) or when their contribution to the overall result is not required.",

Investigators must decide before the trial whether binding or non-binding futility boundaries are to be used, that is whether the early stopping for futility must be strictly adhered to, or whether they can be overruled without risking an inflation of the type I error rate. This choice affects on the overall definition of the early stopping thresholds (both for superiority and for futility).",

The reduction in expected sample size compared to a fixed design, is typically around 15% for O'Brien-Fleming [175] boundaries [184] . Group sequential designs are the optimal choice in terms of minimising the expected sample size [178] . The implication is that any other design aiming to reduce the expected sample size can only perform as well as, but never better than, the group sequential option. In addition, with group sequential methods being widespread [174] their implementation is likely to be simpler than more novel adaptive designs, and also more familiar to regulators and ethics committees.",

Typically, the re-estimation of the sample size focuses on the estimation of design parameters at an interim analysis to re-calculate the sample size in order to achieve, for example, a desired conditional power [185] [186] [187] (the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis given the currently available data). Usually, this is done with the option to increase but not the option to decrease the sample size. In practice there is often a limit on what maximum sample size is possible, as large increases to the sample size in this way can be inefficient [188] ; in practice if the estimated sample size exceeds the pre-set maximum then recruitment is usually stopped (a form of stopping for futility).

Based on primary analysis by log-rank test with a target of 80% power, with 5% two-sided type I error rate, to detect a Hazard Ratio (HR) of 0.58 in favour of scheduled surgery, this required 113 events. With accrual time of 2 years and 4 additional years of follow up and a 2\u22123% loss to follow up, the initial study design planned to randomise 340 women.",

Sample size re-assessment designs are not as complex as many other adaptive methods, which means the trial may be planned and started more quickly. The fact that both unblinded and blinded methods are available means that sample size re-assessment can be applied in many different trial settings. There is an upward trend in the use of sample size re-assessment in clinical practice, and as these designs become more widespread it will become increasingly easy to put them forward.",

The suitability of an adaptive method depends largely on the clinical question being addressed. We have presented four key clinical questions for which corresponding adaptive designs may be of use across a wide range of disease areas, study settings and endpoints. For each possible design, there are advantages and disadvantages but in general there are some key themes: there is an increase in efficiency of the design in terms of the expected number of patients or a clear benefit in understanding the question of scientific interest; there are clear ethical advantages to ensuring the right patients are given the best available treatment whenever possible; and the key disadvantage is the additional burden, both in the planning the trial and the interim analyses. Importantly, while the adaptive methods can be highly effective when used in the correct scenario it is not always the case an adaptive method is the best choice [196] and so careful consideration must be taken as to if it is the correct choice.",

Seamless designs [102, 103, 200] , which we have not discussed in detail, use similar adaptive design methodology to combine phases of clinical development: designs may be inferentially seamless, where data from the earlier stage are incorporated into the overall trial results; operationally seamless, avoiding any break in recruitment between the stages of the development process but excluding data from earlier stages from the final analysis of the latter; or both. There are many motivations for conducting seamless designs [201] , making it an active area of research [202] . For many years one major obstacle to the use of adaptive designs in practice has been the lack of suitable software to aid both the design and conduct of trials. This issue is increasingly being tackled by those researching the methods, with many open source packages available for the design and analysis of adaptive methods some of which have been cited in this work. For example rpact [203] is an R package that assists in the design and analysis of confirmatory clinical trials. In addition, there is a steep learning curve to the implementation of such designs; training courses are becoming increasingly available to address this.",
