            "text": "Telemedicine utilizes electronic communication to facilitate encounters when the patient and provider are in different geographic locations. Technology has been used in medicine as early as 1879 when physicians reported using a telephone to reduce unnecessary office visits. 1 In our current era, telemedicine is most commonly used for patients in rural locations with barriers to accessing medical care. The use of telemedicine for pediatric otolaryngology is well established, with institutions such as Nemours Children's Hospital in Delaware regularly using telemedicine to provide services since 2015. The University of California San Diego (UCSD)/Rady Children's Hospital Medical Foundation division of pediatric otolaryngology has been providing telemedicine services on a limited basis for more than 3 years, with an average of four visits per month. The recent increase in demand for direct-to-home telemedicine services secondary to the COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated a rapid ramp-up in the volume of telemedicine services we provide, with the swift adoption of technology by both patients and providers. This required an evaluation of our practice to ensure that the current platform and workflows provide a seamless transition to virtual visits from in-person clinical encounters. Given our geographic location at the border between the United States and Mexico, the San Diego county population is made up of 34.1% Hispanic or Latinos according to the 2019 US Census. 2 A particular concern is that language and technology barriers may limit the use of telemedicine by families who are not native English speakers or have limited digital literacy due to low socioeconomic status. Given the large percentage of our patients who are primarily Spanish speakers, revisions in the current telemedicine platform may be necessary to correct disparities in access to care. We evaluated the percentage of telemedicine visits completed by patients whose primary language is Spanish or other languages and compared it to the percentage of in-person visits completed. Other factors analyzed were the poverty level of the patient's geographical residence and type of insurance (commercial vs. government supported).",

For a pediatric practice, we did not expect to observe a difference in the age and gender of the patients during the two periods. Parents of children are likely to be younger (<60 years of age) and may be more likely to adopt technology when compared to older adults. Using a self-administered survey, DeMartini et al reported a high level of digital technology access among parents in an urban pediatric primary care clinic setting with a high percentage of African American and Medicaid-insured families in a low socioeconomic area. 9 Of respondents, 80% reported having internet at home, and 71% had a smartphone. In that population, 70% of respondents reported that they would use healthcare information supplied digitally if approved by their child's medical provider. It is possible that the younger age of both our patients and their parents, when compared to the general population, has the greatest effect in terms of access to digital technology that may negate the effect of other language and/or socioeconomic barriers.",

            "text": "Another major reason for the lack of difference in patient characteristics may be the fact that we are a tertiary specialty care clinic. Our patient population comes from referrals by pediatricians. During the scheduling process, our clinic staff proactively contacted patients who were previously scheduled for in-person visits or those with an active otolaryngology referral. This scheduling process is likely to be quite different in a primary care clinic setting, where the majority of the visits are initiated by the patients themselves. However, this may serve as an example for other pediatric specialty care practices depending on the level of resources available. There may also be an intrinsic advantage to pediatrics where parents are interested and likely to use technology for the management of their child's health. 10 It was interesting that the most common reason for a telemedicine visit was for otologic complaints. Most publications regarding visits for these issues discuss the use of video endoscopy, where the physician can evaluate the patient's ears. 11, 12 We did not have these systems available, so the visits occurred without otoscopy. Nevertheless, there were no complaints from the families, and limited postencounter surveys were uniformly positive. Due to the limitation of the exam, we had initial concerns that patients with otologic complaints may prefer telephone encounters. However, the majority of the patients chose video visits with the ability to connect face-to-face with the providers. To continue providing telemedicine services in the post-COVID-19 era, it will be essential for us to elicit feedback and review patient and provider satisfaction with both initial and subsequent visits to determine which diagnoses are best suited for video versus in-person visits. This knowledge will help us create a more nuanced triage/scheduling system to maximize the benefit of telemedicine in the future.",

This is despite the fact that we have all Spanish-speaking medical assistants and provide translation services through Epic-linked Zoom calls to all patients whose preferred language is not English. This finding reflects an increased difficulty with technology adoption in Spanish-speaking families. The language barrier did not prevent them from accessing our telemedicine specialty service, but it did require longer time and sometimes multiple rescheduled visits to complete the encounter successfully. To provide a sustainable level of telemedicine care beyond the COVID-19 pandemic era and well into the future, we need to be cognizant of the language barrier and consciously structure future encounters with increased staff support and longer allotted time and examine more efficient ways to provide digital education and translational services to this population. This may pose a financial challenge at an organizational level in this already difficult time. However, we feel that this is an essential commitment as healthcare providers to create equal access to all of our patients.",

Our MyChart adoption rate went from 20%-30% pre-COVID to nearly 100% currently. This will have long-lasting positive effects on improving patientprovider communication. Many patients, including Spanish-speaking ones now, are able to enjoy the ease with which they can contact and communicate with their providers electronically through the patient portal. We will need to remain proactive and continue to strive for better adoption of the patient portal even when in-person visits resume so that we can continue to provide enhanced electronic patient-provider communication.",

Technology usage is expected to be high in terms of internet access and broadband connections. The differences in the rate of electronic technology adoption between the vulnerable and the general population may be small and could not be detected using the current study design. Findings may be different in a practice that includes more rural or remote populations. Second, our unique location at the United States and Mexico border with a large Hispanic population may preclude the generalization of our findings to other communities. Third, we used the rescheduling rate as a proxy for barriers to access due to technology, which may or may not be completely accurate. Some patients may have rescheduled due to other personal reasons. We also were unable to capture those who were never able to be reached by phone, and due to the small numbers, we did not include those who were unable to successfully complete the telemedicine encounter at all. Finally, we analyzed the patient population as a whole and did not assess each patient/family's level of technology availability or digital literacy. A more nuanced analysis using patient-completed surveys may be able to give us more insights into our population's digital landscape, but it is outside the scope of the current study.",
