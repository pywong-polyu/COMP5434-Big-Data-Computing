While ozone treatment has been suggested as an effective disinfection process, no precise mechanism of action has been previously reported. This study aimed to further investigate the effect of ozone treatment on SARS-CoV-2. Therefore, virus collected from nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab and sputum samples from symptomatic patients was exposed to ozone for different exposure times. The virus morphology and structure were monitored and analyzed through Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy (AAS), and ATR-FTIR. The obtained results showed that ozone treatment not only unsettles the virus morphology but also alters the virus proteins' structure and conformation through amino acid disturbance and Zn ion release from the virus non-structural proteins. These results could provide a clearer pathway for virus elimination and therapeutics preparation.",

The spread of virus particles over surfaces or objects in the immediate environment around an infected person is considered a major method of virus transmission. Therefore, a rapid and effective disinfection process without any particular environmental side effects would be benifical 3 . Many useful disinfecting methods, including UV radiation, chlorine-based disinfectants, and hydrogen peroxidase vapor, have been reported, but most of these have limitations, including the inability to access all surfaces as well as long time requirements, which can lead to potential skin disease in UV-based techniques. Among the reported methods, the ozone treatment seems very promising 4-7 . Ozone is the most powerful oxidant found in nature 6-8 , and due to its instability-it decomposes by itself-the ozonization process only needs a short exposure time, whereby there are no harmful residuals that need to be removed after ozonization processes 8, 9 . The potential usefulness and benefit of the ozonization disinfecting process (ODP) have already been reported 9-12 . Although the beneficial effects of Ozone treatment against many viruses have been reported since the 1800s, the inactivation mechanism of action is still relatively unknown 13 . Some studies have reported the effect of ozone on cysteines in the surface proteins of coronaviruses, in which ozone and other oxidants can inhibit virus entry into host cells 14 .",

Coronaviruses, especially the SARS-CoV-2, are rich in cysteine, and their residues must be intact for viral activity, mainly through zinc ion participation 14, 15 . It is known that conserved cysteine residues are important in virus stability and the loss of more than one cysteine affects the formation of the viral envelope 14 . It seems that upon exposure to ozone, the viral surface of SARS-CoV-2 became more heterogenous than the native virus (Fig. 2b) . Desorption of proteins occurs from the boundaries of the membrane patches, gradually leading to the release of proteins. As it is observed in both lateral phase images (Fig. 2b ,f), many debris were liberated and dispersed near the virion itself, which might be attributed to the breakdown of the viral envelope or release of proteins caused by ozone treatment. Kuznetsov et al. studied the effect of detergents on HIV using the AFM technique and observed similar viral fragments, proteins, and viral debris 16 . Further, ozone attacks the unsaturated fatty acids in the membrane with the possible consequence of lipid peroxidation 9 , which is observed by increased malondialdehyde, one of the aldehydic products of lipid peroxidation 17 .",

It was reported that two spectra are observed at 2924 and 2920 cm \u22121 for single planar phospholipid bilayers and dry phospholipid 18 . Accordingly, the shift can be attributed to an ozone attack on the virus phospholipid bilayers in the viral envelope that disturbs the envelope's proper structure. Additionally, the pH decreases in the viral suspension with increasing exposure time as a result of carboxylic acid formation (the wide peak from 3200 to 3400 cm \u22121 ), which further proves the presence of the OH group of carboxylic acid on the surface (Supplementary Information, Table S1 ). Another slight blue shift is evident in the IR-spectra (the right spectra) from 1656.56 to 1654.22 cm \u22121 in the amide I region. The intensity of these modes shows that the phospholipid layers are cramped, packed, and torn.",

            "text": "Ozone converts cysteine to cystine. Ozone exposure results in protein secondary and tertiary structure destruction 9 . It has been observed that ozone attacks the amino acids directly, particularly cysteine, methionine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and histidine 9 . Upon exposure to ozone, cysteine is oxidized as the first step to cystine, but further oxidation by ozone converts cysteine to cystic acid 8, 12 . Due to the important role of conserved cysteine residues, the conversion of cysteine to cystine was monitored over 20 min of exposure to ozone (Supplementary www.nature.com/scientificreports/ Information, Figure S2 ). As observed in Supplementary Information, Figure S3 , the intensity of the SH bond decreased dramatically, probably because of cysteine (disulfide bond) formation. The viral suspension samples were also exposed to ozone and were then evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and AFM techniques. The TEM image, Supplementary Information, Figure S4 , shows two connected virus particles; it seems SH groups from adjacent viruses are linked to form disulfide bonds after 2 min of ozone exposure. After 2 min, they bind together due to the formation of a disulfide bond as it is shown in Fig. 3a -d, and after 4 and 6 min of exposure time, the viruses are totally damaged, and the remaining components are aggregated, as observed in Fig. 4 . The effect of ozone on the morphology of the virus at different exposure times (2, 4, and 6 min) has also been investigated, as shown in Fig. 4 (will be discussed) later. Additionally, ATR-FTIR was used to indicate protein denaturation 19 . The IR-spectra was taken after every modification step and are shown in Supplementary Information, Figure S3 . It is observed that cysteine residue SH groups readily oxide to disulfide upon ozone exposure.",

As it is already mentioned, the virus cysteine residues need to be intact in the virus protein structures, mainly through zinc ion participation, to be able to play their crucial role in the viral activity 14, 15 . Zinc ions participate in many different cellular processes, and zinc-cysteine finger motifs have been proven to play a crucial role in proper protein-folding, catalysis, regulation of various enzymes, transcription factors, and other activities still under study. A group of these finger domains that stabilizes protein structures can interact with other biomolecules, such as RNA and DNA.As previously reported, exposure to oxidative conditions results in Zn 2+ ion removal from proteins' zinc-cysteine finger motifs and disulfide bond formation between the cysteine residues, which consequently denaturize proteins' structure and alter their solubility 20, 21 . Anja Seybert et al. revealed that during protein refolding in the denaturation-renaturation process, Zn 2+ is essential for the rescue of the enzymatic activities of coronavirus helicases 22 . Atomic absorption spectroscopy was applied to measure the concentration of zinc in the supernatant after being exposed to ozone for 2 min. The zinc concentration was found to be approximately one part per million. It was observed that the attachment of the zinc-cysteine complex to the silicon surface is lost upon the release of zinc from cysteine moiety as a result of ozone exposure (Supplementary Information, Figure S3 ). Zinc ions participate in many different cellular processes, and zinc-cysteine finger domains have been proven to have a crucial role in the proper folding, catalysis, and regulations of various enzymes and transcription factors 23, 24 . Zinc/sulfur enzymes frequently lose their catalytic activity after the oxidative release of the catalytic 25 . Coronaviruses employ a set of non-structural proteins (nsp) produced as cleavage products of the ORF1a and ORF1ab (viral polyproteins that assemble to assist viral replication and transcription) 24 . Zinc finger motifs are observed in SARS-CoV-2 non-structural proteins, especially nsp3 (PDBID: 6W9C), nsp10 (PDBID: 6WKQ), and nsp12 (PDBID: 7BTF) [26] [27] [28] . Two types of zinc finger motifs structurally stabilize nsp3 for interaction with other proteins and biomolecules (Fig. 5a) . According to Fig. 5b , four cysteine residues, provided by two \u03b2-hairpins, chelate Zn 2+ ion in the zinc ribbon of the protein finger domains (Fig. 5c ). Exposure to oxidative conditions results in Zn 2+ removal from the finger along with disulfide bond formation between the cysteine residues and consequently decreases enzymatic activity or inactivates the protein 20, 21 . Zn 2+ ion chelation of cysteine residues at the protein interface modulates a supermolecular assembly that subsequently enables enzymatic activity. According to Fig. 5b ,a cysteine residue (Cys270) from each domain chelate Zn 2+ ion for a proper trimer formation. These cysteine residues are sensitive to redox conditions, and upon exposure to oxidative agents readily form disulfide bonds and release a Zn 2+ ion that results in the formation of free monomers and consequently disrupts the enzyme activity 29 .",

Studies have shown that mutation in Zn coordinated residues abrogate nsp10 interactions with nsp14 and nsp16, probably due to the protein misfolding 35 . It should also be mentioned that SARS Coronavirus nsp14 includes three Zn finger motifs from which the one in the proximity of the active site plays a role in the catalysis, and the other two are responsible for the enzyme structure stability 25, 30 . Nsp12 (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; RdRp) contains two zinc fingers (Fig. 5g-i) , each coordinated to three cysteines and a histidine residue 36 . Computational studies suggest that the zinc motifs are a part of a conserved mechanism of RdRp switching, which changes RdRp domain orientations to stabilize the protein structure in different phases of its catalytic activity 37 . Ultimately, exposure to oxidative agents, like ozone, would result in disulfide formation and loss of Zn 2+ from the binding site of the virus' key nsps that inhibit the enzyme activity or alter its proper function.",

It seems the viruses that have lost their genomes appear narrower in the 3D image because of the finite size of the AFM tip.

The results of atomic absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy showed that ozone breaks down virus proteins through three mechanisms; it destroys the virus envelope, converts cysteine to cystine through disulfide bond formation between adjacent virus particles, and finally release Zn ions from the virus protein structures which eventually destroy the structure of the proteins and alter their proper activity. In addition, increasing the time of ozone exposure leads to the formation of new crystals, which may be damaged by the remnants of virus particles. The obtained results would definitely expand our knowledge to develop virus elimination techniques as well as potential therapeutics and treatment mechanisms employing oxidizing agents like ozone. The pH was adjusted either by ultra-pure NaOH or HCl solutions before adjusting to the final volume. Hydrofluoric acid (49%), sulfuric acid (96%), hydrogen peroxide (30%), and ammonium fluoride (40%) were all VLSI grade chemicals purchased from Aldrich, Merck, and GEM Microelectronic Materials (Arizona, USA).
