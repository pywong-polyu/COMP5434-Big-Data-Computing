            "text": "Supply Chain Management is in constant evolution, and Supply Chain Resilience (SCR) appears as a recent offspring result of changes in how companies do business. Research efforts on the topic have led to a focus on the basic concepts of SCR, leaving a relevant research gap on the modelling and quantification of the SCR behaviour. In fact, there is not yet a consensus on SCR metrics or on how to quantify SCR. Most SCR models fail to incorporate relevant characteristics of the supply chain's performance, as are the impacts perceived by downstream customers. This work addresses such gaps, and a new resilient SC metric is proposed, which is incorporated into a developed optimisation model, where economic and responsiveness objectives are maximised when designing and planning resilient SC considering all SC entities. The model is applied to a case study that shows that decisionmakers should avoid adopting universal strategies when managing their SC and instead should define the best plan for their SC operation. The impacts perceived by downstream customers are analysed. Moreover, it can be concluded that there is a correlation between the SC performance and the new SCR metric, easing the process of designing and planning the SC when resilience concerns are at stake.",

This activity implies the study of the main concerns inside SC operations and SCR, in particular, arises as a novel approach to manage the consequences of high-impact events on SC.

Thus, meeting one research gap in this field (Ribeiro and Barbosa-P\u00f3voa 2018b) . Most published articles leave the SCR to qualitative interpretations (Das 2018) , and few look into quantitative analysis (Sokolov et al. 2016; Cardoso et al. 2015) . A quantitative approach is pursued in this paper by exploring financial aspects coupled with service level goals, modelled as a SCR metric that is used in the design and planning of resilient SC when uncertainty is present. To show the applicability of such approach, a mixed-integer linear programming model (MILP) is proposed, where different SC networks are studied, from only forward to closed-loop supply chains (CLSC), the latter encompassing circular economy principles. The results show the justifiability of such approaches towards the incorporation of resilience into supply chains, providing decision-makers with a broader insight into SCR as well as a means to improve SC operations.",

This includes the development of a new metric, meeting in this way a relevant research gap identified by academics and practitioners-the need to find adequate measures to supply chain resilience. This metric combines the profit goal with the capacity of guaranteeing high service levels under disruptive scenarios.

Information sharing between the different players can suffice for the appropriate SC response to disturbances (Sabahi and Parast 2020; Tao, Lai, and Zhou 2020) . Positive relationships can foster responsiveness and efficiency in the SC (Goffnett and Williams 2019); on the contrary, confrontations can have negative impacts.

Dealing with disruptive events must be done resorting to a holistic approach, where SCR has a lot to gain by taking advantage of the knowledge and experience provided by other SC fields that handle uncertainty and risk. Examples of such benefit are the application of the concept of reliability (Ha, Jun, and Ok 2018) or Supply Chain Risk Management (SCRM). One can even consider SCR as an offspring of SCRM (Ponomarov and Holcomb 2009; K\u00f6nig and Spinler 2016; Shekarian and Mellat Parast 2020) . Risk management consists of managing proactive practices taking into account vulnerability. Those can be prospective strategies to enhance SCR (Rajesh and Ravi 2015) . Inspired by the biological immune system Srinivasan and Tew (2017) present a SCRM framework that can be adapted to SCR. However, to correctly face SCR adaptations are needed since the traditional methods of dealing with risk rely vastly on the identification and consequent quantification of probabilities and impacts of a particular event. An antagonistic approach is followed in the context of SCR, where most common events can be categorised as an unknown-unknown risk and where events' probabilities are extremely difficult to obtain. The characteristics of uncertainty elements turn strategic and tactical levels of decision into a fundamental part in the process of building and maintaining a resilient SC (S\u00e1enz, Revilla, and Acero 2018; Sahebjamnia, Torabi, and Mansouri 2015; Cohen and Lee 2020; Kaur and Singh 2019) . Thus, macro and network decisions are a crucial factor when handling SCR (Asian and Nie 2014; Kim, Chen, and Linderman 2015; Singh 2020) , as it already is in other fields of SCM (Farahani et al. 2013; Mota et al. 2015 Mota et al. , 2017 .",

Ribeiro and Barbosa-P\u00f3voa (2018b) summarise SCR in a mind-map of 4 elements (Focus Event, Performance Level, Speed and Adaptive Framing). It is by combining these different elements that one should consider how to evaluate SCR for each particular case properly. The need for tailored attention to the specification of the focus event and the requirements in terms of speed and adaptive framing lead to a broad set of examples on the SCR metrics used in the literature. The resilience of the whole SC is the result of the resilience of each element and the interactions between them. The design and planning of SC networks is of extreme relevance since it affects different groups of decision. For instance it will influence inventory costs, production and transportation costs, but it can also imply in what is the growth capability of a company (Song and Sun 2017) . Modelling could provide the tools to make better decisions, identifying the weakest links and work with them as best as possible (Adobor 2019).",

SCR particularities guide authors to follow OR methods that are well-established in the field of SCM, with optimisation being the most frequently used approach, closely followed by simulation or decision analysis (Ribeiro and Barbosa-P\u00f3voa 2018b) . While Carvalho et al. (2012) or Schmitt and Singh (2012) face the challenge of designing a resilient SC through a simulation model, Cardoso et al.

Recognizing this, Munoz and Dunbar (2015) quantifies resilience in five dimensions (recovery time, impact, profile length, performance loss and weighted sum). Another approach is the development of a single index, as presented by Azevedo, Carvalho, and Cruz-Machado (2016) ; Soni, Jain, and Kumar (2014) ; Wang and Ip (2009) ; Hosseini, Ivanov, and Dolgui (2019) .

These strategies are, however, far from being feasible \"plug and play\" solutions in real applications (Ribeiro and Barbosa-P\u00f3voa 2018a) . For instance, back-up suppliers might lead to performance degradation if the SC is still reliant on unreliable suppliers (Demirel, Kapuscinski, and Yu 2018) . Two operational metrics are often used: Expected Net Present Value (ENPV) and Expected Customer Service Level (ECSL) have been shown to drive supply chain management. It is natural for a new metric to emerge, combining the two operational indicators aiming to be a more comprehensive SCR metric. In this new metric, both economic and responsiveness goals of the supply chain are achieved while guaranteeing supply chain resilience. Although the forehand listed metrics can be present as resilience metrics, it is impossible to retrieve any conclusion regarding the resilience of a given SC solely from an individual parameter. Thus, these metrics must be used in combination and relative to each other to provide useful information.",

However, it is not expected for this value to go above the unitary value since the N PV re f is the best economic performance when compared to a situation where disruptions occur. Generically, this parcel is responsible for penalising deviations from the best ENPV possible, with the values closest to one being those that most positively impact SC performance. The second term, introduces the concern of meeting customer demand as a key decision factor when a strategic decision is to be made. This term assumes values between zero and one, as it represents the mean value for the fraction between the unsatisfied demand and total demand. Generically, this parcel is responsible for not letting the customer service level drop in complete favour of economic return and will generate the most benefit to the OF as close to zero as possible.",

Defining a target service level, in the context of disruptions can also mislead results, due to its relationship with steady-state and disruptions.

In the area of Milan, the mandatory shutdown lasted for months and the return to normal was done gradually, depending on the type of service (Jewkes and Amante 2020). Production could also stop if for some reason there was no workforce available. The traditional example of labour strikes had similar consequences to factories that had to stop operations due to infections of SARS-COV-2 amongst their workers. This forced stop could happen in all kinds of factories, since regardless of the relevance of the product being made, keep on working could pile up infections inside and outside the factory.

Case ND closely follows, Fig. 10 , in the pursuit of improving SC responsiveness, reaches higher levels of ECSL with a more significant reduction of ENPV, which penalises the overall OF value. Case NB provides a network that leads to a substantial increase in ECSL, often with notable drops in economic return. Case NC allows direct flows between plants and markets, adding flexibility to the network by increasing flow complexity since the direct links to markets add redundancy, thus increasing ECSL. However, the increased flexibility is not able to cope with Disruption 2, an event that disrupts the supply side of the SC and where the SC cannot take advantage of the multitude of flows. To meet customer demand, the SC has to rely on outsourcing, reaching outstanding levels of service quality in an evident trade-off with the economic return. This shows that this management alternative should also be considered when planning SC. The case with fewer limitations, Case NE, although providing a SC network similar to Case NC, does not return the SC with the higher resilient behaviour, since the increased investment leads to lower financial results when facing some types of disruptive events.",

It is relevant to compare how similar those are with the metric here presented and the pros and cons of each. provides a Bayesian approach to a resilience metric applied to the context of SC the ratio between recovery and loss presented by Henry and Emmanuel Ramirez-Marquez (2012) . This metric is devoted to an operational level of SCM, where time has to be precisely described. This characteristic unable its use for strategic decisions, naturally with a multitude of periods. Due to its different objectives, any comparison between the results from the two metrics is rendered unpractical. Azevedo, Carvalho, and Cruz-Machado (2016) proposed an index obtained from four vectors (Lean, Agile, Resilient and Green) that ultimately provide a metric for resilience. However, this was done with the automotive industry in mind, and the adaptation to a generic SC is not trivial, in fact can hardly be done. The model is quantified in a scale from 1 to 5 in terms of implementation of resilient practices or the perceived ability of the company for a particular behaviour. This approach is highly dependent on the collection of data from the SC and the company operation since it relies on the identification of practices and/or educated guesses on the SC capability, which, as mentioned before in this paper, can be an extremely difficult task in the context of SCR. As we aim to have a generic metric, the quantitative comparison with this metric renders difficult, as its focus is mainly operational. Soni, Jain, and Kumar (2014) 's approach to measuring SCR relies on the identification of resilience enablers, recurring to a survey with practitioners and academics. The enablers found are in line with the literature (information, collaboration, agility, sustainability, risk and revenue sharing, trust, visibility, risk management culture, adaptive capability and structure) and, as in the previous work, fall under more operational objectives that entail qualitative interpretation of the SC operation. Wang and Ip (2009) 's resilience metric is focused on the aircraft industry and is a far simpler approach to the problem. It takes into account the supply and demand needed for a continuous flow of aeroplanes. Nevertheless, this simplification reduces the depth of the analysis. The case study applied considers a two-tier SC, reducing the replicability of the metric dramatically to different case studies or industries, turning it impractical to compare with other SC.",

In fact, it was impossible to use any of the published SCR metrics since those are restrictive in terms of the industry for which they were designed. Moreover, the metrics are operational or reliant on qualitative considerations that disable the possibilities of comparison between SC, when considering quantitative decision support approaches. Thus, there is a research gap identified which has been tackled in this paper. A new resilience metric is created from the combination of the two factors (economic and responsiveness). This resilience metric allows for a comparison between several possible cases and to infer on what are the more resilient cases. A positive correlation between what is the immediate interpretation of results with the value of the resilience metric was observed, where SC with poor results have a correspondent low level in the newly proposed metric.",
