Moreover, another positive aspect may well be the strengthening of social and relational skills [5] . Furthermore, physical exercise can be considered as a possible form of therapy both in the treatment of psychopathologies and neurodegenerative illnesses [6] and as an alternative and complementary therapy too [4] . Recent studies have shown the importance of physical activity thanks to its capacity of protecting the immune system during the COVID-19 pandemic [7] . In addition, physical exercise can attenuate anxiety, stress, and depression symptoms, improving sleep disorders [8] . Nevertheless, anxiety and depression can be associated to compulsive physical exercise [9] since there is a weak boundary between sport positive aspects and the risk of determining dependence: the actual research, indeed, also underlines the cons of doing sport (for instance, the exercise addiction might cause relevant psychophysical consequences) [10] .",

While regular exercise is generally a healthy activity, exercise addiction generally involves performing excessive amounts of exercise to the detriment of physical health, spending too much time exercising to the detriment of personal and professional life, and exercising regardless of physical injury [11] [12] [13] . It may also involve a state of dependence upon regular exercise which involves the occurrence of severe withdrawal symptoms when the individual is unable to exercise [11] . In fact, Aidman and Woolard suggested that the symptoms that appear in athletes 24-36 h after missing a planned training session when it is impossible or canceled should be used as the criteria for the diagnosis of exercise addiction. These withdrawal signs include anxiety; restlessness; a feeling of guilt, tension, and discomfort; apathy; sluggishness; lack of appetite; sleeplessness; and headaches [14] . Exercise addiction also shows a high comorbidity with eating disorders [12] .",

With the imposition of staying at home and the consequent stress of the global situation, an increased use of physical activity and physical exercise as a form of psychophysical release has been hypothesized, especially to combat boredom and reduce stress [22] ; this could have led to the development of compulsive use of physical exercise, also resulting in the development of exercise addiction [15] .

In their general review, they found out that both acute and chronic moderate-to-vigorous PA interventions improved brain structure and function, as well as cognition, and academic outcomes, in children from 6 to 13 years old. They refer to chronic PA behavior as PA that is repeated and lasts longer than a single session or episode. Thus, acute PA research reflects the immediate (transient) response to a single bout of PA, while chronic PA reflects a true change in an individual's baseline (i.e., a prolonged/permanent shift in activity). In the case of chronic PA, the change is not as tightly coupled in time to the last bout of PA. Anyway, moderate evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) indicated an association between moderate-to-vigorous intensity PA and improvements in cognition, including performance on academic achievement and neuropsychological tests, such as those measuring processing speed, memory, and executive function. Two systematic reviews reported by Erickson et al. have described differences in brain structure and function as a result of PA in RCTs, with additional support from cross-sectional comparisons of higher and lower fit groups of preadolescents. Briefly, findings have demonstrated differences in brain structure including greater integrity in specific white matter tracts following PA interventions. Functional brain changes resulting from PA interventions have also been noted in preadolescent children. Such studies have indicated PA intervention-induced benefits to the neuroelectric system as well as changes in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals. Collectively, there is moderate evidence that PA is beneficial to cognition and brain structure and function during preadolescence.",

The authors pointed out morphological modifications of cerebral structures and improvements of cognition abilities in children, after physical exercise, analyzing data from 58 articles. Positive influence on selective attention, development of better lexical accomplishment, effective linguistic comprehension and improved syntactical and orthographical skills were also observed. The domains in which the positive effect of physical exercise is more pronounced-in the period between childhood and preadolescence-are working memory, cognitive flexibility, and inhibition control, with consequent pursuit of objectives capability. Moreover, research suggested that physical activity positively influences verbal functions, which facilitates the learning of words in a new language, leading to richer networks of words and their meanings, and also improves spelling performance, language understanding, and the detection of syntactic errors.",

Specifically, a meta-analysis conducted by Cerrillo-Urbina et al. [26] examinated five trials grouped according to the intervention program: aerobic and yoga exercise. The meta-analysis included a total of 249 children diagnosed with ADHD. Of these, 230 participated in aerobic exercises and 19 in yoga exercises. The average sample size of all groups was 31.13 subjects. The meta-analysis suggests that aerobic exercise had a moderate to large effect on core symptoms such as attention, hyperactivity and impulsivity and related symptoms such as anxiety, executive function, and social disorders in children with ADHD. Yoga exercise suggests an improvement in the core symptoms of ADHD. The main cumulative evidence indicates that short-term aerobic exercise, based on several aerobic intervention formats, seems to be effective for mitigating symptoms such as attention, hyperactivity, impulsivity, anxiety, executive function and social disorders in children with ADHD.",

Studying at better universities or colleges may improve the capability to deal with emotional distress and develop coping strategies which, in their turn, can prevent behavioral disorders and presumably numerous other problems. In fact, the level of education seemed to be a protective factor, as resulted in Menczel's research [34] : 65% of the sample-1743 subjects, 58.6% of which were female, the mean age was 31.7 (SD = 8.491), the youngest person was 18, and the oldest one was 61-year-old-had a university or college degree. The subjects were administered questionnaires consisted of different parts, namely, demographic questions, e.g., age, gender, residency, weight and height. In the second part, sporting habits were assessed, such as the frequency, the kind of sport they practiced. Menczel also measured the existence of eating disorders. As the final part of the survey, fitness users were asked to fill in two standardized questionnaires, the Exercise Addiction Inventory (EAI) and the Exercise Dependence Scale-21 (EDS). Additionally, to these scales-self-esteem, well-being and sensation seeking were also measured. Furthermore, body dissatisfaction was measured with the Eating Disorder Inventory and the SCOFF scale. In terms of education, the higher level of studies, the lower scores people obtained on exercise dependence (ED) (rs, 0.094, p \u2264 0.001; rs, 0.148, p \u2264 0.001). As Menczel suggests, addictive exercising may link to having worse coping mechanisms, poorer ways to deal with stress. One way to improve in it is to study in higher education.",

In the sample, exercise addicted subjects were 32, who were compared with control subjects (n = 47). From the results, it was observed significant differences between genres in EDI-2 total score, where women have obtained higher scores than men (p = 0.048). Participants with primary exercise addiction showed more dysfunctional eating patterns than control group; in fact, significant differences emerged in EDI-2 total score (p < 0.001). Other differences between these groups are associated to behavioral aspects: participants with primary exercise addiction reached higher scores than control group in these TCI subscales: damage avoidance (p = 0.038), persistence (p = 0.024), self-directivity (p = 0.002). In contrast, lower scores were reached in matureness character index (p = 0.033). In SQ total score (p = 0.002) and in anxiety (p = 0.001) and hostility subscales (p < 0.001), better scores were found in participants with primary exercise addiction.

Primary exercise addiction resulted significantly associated with higher scores in muscular dysmorphia, evaluated by MDQ (p < 0.001). Data provided further support to the idea that exercise addiction could be a specific clinical condition associated with psychological symptoms and personality characteristics. These evidences report a relation between excessive physical activity and eating behavioral disorders. Regarding personality characteristics, these results are consistent with those of other studies, in which a negative association between self-esteem and excessive physical activity was highlighted. The results also indicate difficulty in assumption of responsibility and lack of objectives.

In fact, most of the literature currently available focuses on risk factors and other consequences, such as physical damage because of excessive and prolonged exertion and worsening of interpersonal or work relationships. We hypothesize that, since exercise addiction is considered a behavioral addiction, it may produce the following cognitive effects: constructs such as impulsivity, compulsivity, and attention regulation, which may also be relevant, applicable, and successful for understanding and subsequent treatment of behavioral addictions [38] . This, however, is only a hypothesis that should be explored in the future, and which can be a starting point for new research.",

In fact, in cognitive enhancement literature, it is sometimes shown that people with more performing cognitive functions at baseline show reduced enhancement as opposed to clinical populations. Besides, mechanisms of actions are not the same necessarily. For example, the neuroplasticity promoted by neurostimulation techniques among clinical populations can impact to a sufficient level to induce changes in behavior. However, among healthy populations with optimal homeostatic cortical activity, long-term alteration might be necessary to observe the effects of neuroplasticity on behavior [39] . Nevertheless, there are studies that claim the opposite, showing higher cognitive changes in non-clinical populations rather than in clinical populations at baseline [40] . This, therefore, requires further investigation in the future. Secondarily, we do not discuss the cognitive factors of sports addiction and about the risks ensuing from sports addiction. Eventually, a final limitation concerns the fact that the analysis of risk factors for developing exercise addiction during the COVID-19 pandemic refers to an event and a period still in progress, although, at the time of writing, lockdowns are no longer in effect.",

In accordance with the compared literature, a more than beneficial effect of physical activity can be affirmed in promoting a condition of mental health, an enhancement of cognitive function in healthy individuals but also in a preventive and curative key to the well-being of those who are affected by certain psychic disorders. In addition, about the other side of the review, the importance of an adequate psychological-clinical evaluation of psychological distress and personality characteristics associated with exercise addiction stands out. Therefore, the right balance of sports practice could thus become a real coping strategy useful for facing the problems of daily life and for reducing stress and negative emotions, but in a functional way to the psycho-physical health of the subject.
