They have numerous beneficial health effects that include enhancement of the host immune response, antiallergic, antimicrobial, anti-cancer, and anti-inflammatory properties. Probiotics are capable of restoring the impaired microbiome of a dysbiotic gut. They can be isolated from different environments. However, it is frequently suggested that probiotics for human use should come from human sources. The objective of this study was to isolate and characterize novel probiotic strains from the saliva and feces of healthy human individuals. To meet the criteria for probiotic attributes, the isolates were subjected to numerous standard morphological and biochemical tests. These tests included Gram staining, catalase tests, antibiotic susceptibility testing, hemolytic and antagonistic evaluation, tolerance tests involving temperature, NaCl levels, pH and bile salts, adherence ability assays, and genotypic characterization involving 16S rRNA gene sequencing. From 26 saliva and 11 stool samples, 185 microbial strains were isolated. Based on morphological and biochemical characteristics, 14 potential probiotic candidates were selected and identified genotypically. The new strains belonged to Lactobacillus fermentum, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus hire. The selected strains were non-hemolytic, showed high tolerance to low pH and bile salts, and strong adherence abilities. Furthermore, the strains displayed a wide range of antimicrobial activities, particularly against antibioticresistant pathogens such as methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Moreover, five of the selected isolates demonstrated antiproliferative features against human colon cancer cell line (Caco-2). The results of this investigation confirm the diversity of microbial populations in the human gut and saliva, and since these strains are of human origin, they will highly likely display maximal activities in food and drugs set for human use. Hence, the new strains of this study require additional in vivo experiments to assess their health-promoting effects.",

For example, the localized use of the probiotic Lactobacillus plantarum ATCC 10241 strain in a burn model was found to interfere with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, stimulating phagocytosis of this pathogen by tissue phagocytes, decreasing apoptosis, and thereby improving tissue repair (Vald\u00e9z et al., 2005) . In recent years with the emergence of antibiotic resistance, a lot of emphasis has been placed on investigating probiotics and their products as alternatives to antibiotics. The antagonistic activity of probiotics against pathogens is brought about by a series of mechanisms that include, competitive exclusion of pathogens, boosting the function of the intestinal barrier, and producing effective antimicrobial compounds such as peptides (Fijan, 2016; Besser et al., 2019) . Hence, numerous Lactobacillus strains have been found to inhibit the growth of many different types of multi-drug resistant bacterial pathogens, such as MRSA (methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus), Streptococcus mutans, Escherichia coli, P. aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Shigella spp. and Clostridium difficile (McFarland, 2015; Kumar et al., 2016; Kang et al., 2017; Chen et al., 2019; Nami et al., 2019b) .",

In other research involving colon cancer, the administration of Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 314 and Lactobacillus fermentum NCIMB 5221 in the murine colon cancer model was found to reduce or stop the growth of tumors, by stimulating an antitumor immune response .

Probiotics used by humans are usually isolated from different environments that include dairy and non-dairy sources. However, probiotics that are isolated from human or animal intestines have certain characteristics that differ from those isolated from dairy products. For example, probiotics isolated from the human gut are usually more resistant to high bile salt concentrations and low pH levels. Furthermore, they possess higher adhering abilities when compared to those of dairyisolated probiotics. Thus, non-diary probiotics are highly likely to be exploited in people who suffer from lactose intolerance (Sornplang and Piyadeatsoontorn, 2016; Sardana et al., 2018) .",

Values are shown in mean \u00b1 Standard deviation. rate of hydrophobicity and auto-aggregation were observed in SA 151, SA 135, and in ST 179, ST 13, respectively. The adhesion results demonstrate the ability of the selected strains to adhere to the epithelial cells and thus colonize the gut. Adhesion is a very important trait of a suitable and prevailing probiotic, as it prevents the colonization of the gastrointestinal tract by pathogenic bacteria (Abushelaibi et al., 2017; Somashekaraiah et al., 2019) . As a key feature, a good probiotic candidate should not possess or acquire any antibiotic resistance genes. Consistent with the literature, this research found that nearly all isolates were resistant to kanamycin and streptomycin, except for SA 109, which showed sensitivity to streptomycin (Kook et al., 2019) . A possible explanation for these results may be the overuse of antibiotics in Iran. Notably, some were also found to be resistant to vancomycin, which is in accordance with previous reports that have shown vancomycin resistance as an intrinsic trait of LAB, such as Lactobacillus, Leuconostoc, and Pediococcus. In fact, many Lactobacillus strains, including L. fermentum are routinely used in the food industry. Vancomycin resistance in this group of bacteria is chromosomally encoded and is non-transferable and non-inducible (Swenson et al., 1990; Tynkkynen et al., 1998; Sharma et al., 2014) .",

(2019) , who demonstrated the antiproliferative effects of the culture-free supernatant (CFS) of a L. fermentum strain against colorectal cancer (CRC). It was shown that the CFS induces apoptosis, thereby inhibiting cell growth in CRC lines. The antiproliferative activity of L. fermentum is brought about by preventing NF-\u03baB signaling. They showed that the Lactobacillus CFS is capable of inducing cell death, and thus has the potential to be used as a powerful multitarget anti-cancer chemotherapeutic agent .",
