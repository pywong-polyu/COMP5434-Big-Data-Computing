Over the past few years, mentoring has become an area of focus as being an important aspect of radiologists' career starting from the early trainee level. A variety of mentorship strategies have come to the forefront, allowing many avenues for those seeking to engage in mentorship as either a mentee or mentor. Mosaic mentoring is a new approach that emphasizes utilizing a collection of mentorship approaches to maximize outcomes based on individual and/or domain-specific needs. The purpose of our paper is to provide a brief overview of a variety of mentorship models while introducing the concept of mosaic mentoring and exploring how it can benefit radiologists throughout their career.",

Formal mentorship in a residency or medical school program is generally targeted toward specific domains (e.g., research and clinical) and is integrated into department-supported activities. It enforces accountability from mentors and mentees and typically involves departmental incentives, such as funding for various interactive opportunities. However, as it is an organized system where mentors and mentees are typically matched by someone else, these relationships are not created organically and may not meet all of the mentee's needs. In contrast, informal mentorship is unstructured without formal integration into workplace responsibilities. Informal mentorship can allow mentees and mentors to selfselect based on personality or other compatibilities. However, informal mentorship may lack specific accountability as well as posing potential barriers for individuals who consider themselves more introverted, as they may experience challenges in reaching out to potential informal mentors.",

Group or teambased mentoring is an alternative option that allows one or multiple mentors to guide several mentees at once or in tandem. This can allow for flexibility in scheduling and provide a diversity of meeting opinions. Geographical challenges as well as current social distancing requirements between a mentor and mentee can be overcome with \"distance mentoring\" including over the phone interactions or via videoconferencing. A self-mentoring model has also been described, whereby the mentee acts as their own mentor, using forms of self-reflection or external written and video materials as tools5. Self-mentoring can potentially empower oneself and lead to increased communication skills and self-confidence which in turn can improve leadership and organizational skills [2] . To date, there are no specific publications about the outcomes of self-mentoring specifically in radiology. However, intentional motivational and leadership language have been validated to be a strategic medium for leaders in the USA and internationally to positively influence their peers [2] . This strategic communication medium can be adapted toward achieving personal goals and advancing one's radiology career.",

Near-peer mentoring reflects interactions between individuals in close career stage, for example, between a senior and a junior resident3. Peer-to-peer mentoring has the potential to remove a mentees' perceived fear of negative evaluation from mentors that could potentially arise in more traditional hierarchical interactions [3] . In comparison, reverse mentoring is an innovative mentorship model that connects younger mentors with older mentees to share knowledge and experiences on cultural and technological advances. This model reverses the traditional perception of mentors and mentees and allows for a two-way process of exchanging experiences and ideas [4] .",

Data have shown that there is increased mentee satisfaction when mentors are chosen by mentees, rather than being assigned [5] . Studies have also demonstrated that female residents and female junior staff preferred and benefited most, from female mentors [6] . There is lack of data on the benefits of ethnically diverse mentors, specifically from underrepresented racial and ethnic minorities in radiology, including indigenous populations. This is in line with the paucity of research on ethnic and racial diversity and disparities in radiology. The lack of underrepresented racial and ethnic minority role models may potentially contribute to lack of diversity in radiology as per Lebel et al. [7] . If radiology departments were to develop mentorship opportunities for women and visible minority medical students, this would provide early exposure to the field and improve overall diversity in Canadian radiology practices and leadership [7] .",

Trainees can meet additional mentors at conferences to learn about different ways to lead a successful radiology practice.

Most recently, programs have been established through Twitter accounts to create mentorship match programs in radiology. This allowed for hundreds of mentors to be virtually matched across the globe during the COVID-19 pandemic, addressing a huge need amid travel restrictions and conference cancelations. In addition, social media have been utilized to create mentorship opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities, groups that in the past have had difficulty accessing mentorships in radiology [3, 15, 16] .",

In addition, multiple mentees were recognized with awards and winning grants [17] . The multiple benefits of mosaic mentoring out way its pitfalls. However, to maximize the positive impact of a hybrid model of mentorship styles, mentees must have clear goals and timelines in order to avoid unmet expectations and optimize time spent with mentors. Implementing specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) objectives can help achieve this step [18] .",
