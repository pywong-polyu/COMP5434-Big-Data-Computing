However, early diagnosis of ABI is difficult due to an inability to safely transport patients and lack of available transport personnel.

In ECMO patients where MRI at 1.5T is contraindicated and transportation for HCT can be dangerous and requires significant human resources, POC MRI allows early ABI detection, which is critical in improving ECMO survival [4] . As demonstrated, POC MRI detected new ischemic strokes, one of which was not visualized with HCT, suggesting that POC MRI may be a good bedside diagnostic tool for cerebral ischemia.

Eliminating one or two of the sequences that are mirrored by others could decrease duration of the MRI examination, such as the T1. Patient body habitus, as seen in our patients, made positioning in the scanner challenging. As observed, 2 patients had temporary ECMO suction events that appeared to be the result of insufficient support of the thoraco-lumbar spine leading to flexion at the groin. Repositioning the body as flat as possible, thereby preventing flexion of the spine between the bed and the scanning platform, resolved the suction events, making it likely that the femoral drainage cannula position was compromised.",
