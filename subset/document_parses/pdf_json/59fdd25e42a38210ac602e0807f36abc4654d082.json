In this study, we hypothesize that the weather indicators could significantly influence the impact of the corona virus. The Kendall and Spearman rank correlation tests were chosen to conduct the statistical analysis. In this regard, we compiled a daily dataset including confirmed case counts, Recovered case counts, Deceased cases, Average Temperature, Maximum Relative Humidity, Maximum Wind Speed for six most affected states of India during the period of March 25, 2020 to April 24, 2020. We investigated that the average Humidity and Average Temperature seven days ago play a significant role in the recovery of coronavirus cases. The rise in average temperature will improve the recovery rate in the days to come. The cities with very high humidity levels or dry weather conditions have high probabilities of recovery from COVID-19. The findings of this research will help the policymakers to identify risky geographic areas and enforce timely preventive measures.",

This virus exhibits high human-to-human transmissibility, that is the reason it has spread all across the world in a very short span of time. The World Health Organization (WHO) reported 2,626,321 COVID-19 confirmed cases and 181,938 deaths worldwide until April 24, 2020 [1] . The deadly virus has affected more than 210 countries had been affected where United States (US) alone contributed approximately onefourth of the total cases. Other major countries having a significant impact are Spain, Italy, Iran, France, Germany, UK, Turkey, China, and many more. The situation in India has started worsening day by day. The first COVID-19 case in India was reported on January 30, 2020 and as on April 24, 2020 India has 23077 COVID-19 confirmed cases, including 718 deaths [1] . As per WHO, India has not entered into the state of the community transmission, still it has clusters of cases. India had enforced nationwide lockdown from March 25, 2020 to April 14, 2020 and further extended it till May 3, 2020. The lockdown might have lowered the transmission rate of the COVID-19 pandemic. Figure 1 shows the overall picture of confirmed cases of COVID-19 across the states of India. Many geographical, social, political, and environmental factors might influence the impact of this deadly virus.",

Since every state has a different geographical and political environment, we have considered different states of India rather than on state or city. The primary weather indicators i.e. temperature (\u00b0C), wind speed (mph), and Humidity (%) are considered as independent variables for finding the correlation with affected cases of COVID-19. The majority of the related recent studies have considered the metrological indicators of the same day, which could present a false picture in terms of the correlation with COVID-19 cases. Since the incubation period of the COVID-19 virus varies from 1 day to 14 days, we have evaluated one-week old weather indicators.",

The results show that average relative Humidity 7 days ago has a conclusive association with recovered cases in all the states. The two states Tamilnadu and Maharashtra, where the average relative Humidity is in range ~ 65-85 % are positively correlated with recovered cases, which implies that recovery chances are higher in the humid environment. However, the other states where humidity levels are comparatively low and range approximately between 20% to 60% has a negative correlation between relative Humidity 7 days ago with the recovered cases. It can be concluded that the cities with very high humidity levels or very low humidity levels have high probabilities of recovery from COVID-19. By and large, the maximum relative Humidity on the same day doesn't exhibit a significant association with the COVID-19 cases in the duration of this study, which contradicts the study in Iran [12] . In the time interval of this study, we observed that the wind speed does not affect the viral spread or recovery in all the states considered.",
