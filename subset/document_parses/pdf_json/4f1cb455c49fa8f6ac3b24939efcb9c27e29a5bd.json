Prior studies links between obesity, nutrition and depression among women. However, less is known how food insecurity may moderate that relationship. Methods: Data were employed from the Collaborative Psychiatric Epidemiology Surveys (CPES), 2001-2003. Two logistic regression models were Logistic regression was used to determine the association between obesity, gender, food insecurity, and past year Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We then stratified by gender, and tested the association between obesity and past year MDD, and if food insecurity moderated the association. Results: Obesity was associated with an increased risk for past year Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) among females (AOR = 1.35; 95% CI 1.17-1.55) and was not associated among males (AOR = 1.07; 95% CI, 0.86-1.32). Women who reported that reported both obesity and food insecurity reported higher odds of past year MDD episode (AOR = 3.16; 95% CI, 2.36-4.21, than women who did not report food insecurity (AOR = 1.08; 95% CI, 1.02-1.38). Conclusion: With rising rates of mental health problems, females should be closely monitored to understand how poor diets, food insecurity, and obesity play a role in mental health outcomes. It is recommended that clinicians and treatment providers consider the patient's diet and access to nutritious foods when conducting their assessment.",

Simon and his colleagues (2006) concluded that obesity is associated with approximately 25% increase in odds of mood and anxiety disorders [10] . A large cross-sectional study conducted by McMartin et al. [11] reported consistent inverse relationships between fruit and vegetable intake and major depressive disorder (MDD) [12] . The associations between dietary patterns and depression remains significant and strong epidemiological evidence suggests that poor diet can have a negative effect on mental health disorders. Implementing changes to the diet is gaining popularity in life sciences as it provides structural, functional, and biochemical roles of macro-and micronutrients in mental well-being [13] .",

According to data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the rate of obesity for adult women is over 40% in the U.S. [18] , and is expected to continue to rise over the next 30 years [19] , placing even more women at risk. In addition, obesity and depression both carry an increased risk for other diseases such as cardiovascular disease [20] . There are still more gaps to fill when it comes to understanding obesity and mental health among women. The dietary intake in the female population in conjunction with the biochemical measurements of diet can aid in distinguishing the cause of MDD, whether it is caused by reduced intake, altered metabolism or enzymatic function [21] .",

Food insecurity was based on the following question 'In past yr-how often not enough money to buy food?', and coded binary with 1 representing any report of food insecurity in the past year. This variable 'food insecurity' was selected based on its definition of having inconsistent access to adequate food because of limited financial and other resources [32] , and has been applied in prior studies [33] [34] [35] .",

Food insecurity is also the uncertainty of acquiring nutritious food in a safe and socially acceptable manner Food insecurity has been found to be associated with obesity and unhealthy dietary patterns, both of which have negative health outcomes [43] .

Firstly, the causeeffect relationships cannot be established in this study, given cross-sectional data were used. Second, was that surveys from non-English speaking Latinos and Asians were not collected in the NCS-R data. Third, depression diagnosis was based on DSM-IV criteria, as DSM-5 is currently implemented. There have been changes to diagnostic criteria, including the dropping of the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, which was used in DSM-IV. This may pose a challenge among clinicians, who are using DSM-5 diagnosis to treat depression. However, the changes from DSM-IV to DSM-5 are not likely to significantly impact prevalence rates, and not affect the characteristics of diagnoses [50] . Fourth, BMI was calculated using self-reported height and weight by each participant. Prior studies have found that it is common for individuals to inaccurately report their height and weight, that include both over and underreporting measurements [51] .
