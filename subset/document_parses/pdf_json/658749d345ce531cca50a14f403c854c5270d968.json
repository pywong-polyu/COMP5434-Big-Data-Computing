            "text": "We read with interest the outbreak investigation carried out in late March/early April 2020 in four nursing homes affected by COVID-19 outbreaks in central London. 1 During this study, 27 days after the first death and 21 days after the first resident tested positive, 126 (40%) of nursing home residents were found SARS-CoV-2 positive. A striking finding of this investigation was that 60% of SARS-CoV-2 positive residents were either asymptomatic or only had atypical symptoms for COVID-19 during the two weeks prior to testing. Asymptomatic nursing home staff (4%) were identified as potential source of viral transmission to the residents. Additionally, genomic analysis identified one cluster involving one staff member and two residents in the same home. This work highlights the need for evaluations of the accuracy of testing strategies to identify the reservoir of asymptomatic COVID-19 cases in nursing home (NH) and adjust the control measures. In light of our local experience, and in the context of a post-lockdown period with a low incidence of COVID-19 in the general population, we analysed the results of strategies adopted by 50 NH to assess the accuracy of testing professionals, residents or both for investigating the spread of COVID-19 around a positive case.",

Since 07/04/2020, the French national screening recommendations in NH rely on testing all professionals when a COVID-19 positive case is identified (resident or professional). 2 The screening of residents is recommended up to three suspected cases. Since 27/05/2020, the health authorities in the Vend\u00e9e department, located in western France ( Fig. 1 ) , recommended to systematically screen all residents and professionals after the identification of a COVID-19 positive case in NH. Moreover, a universal RT-PCR screening was organized in voluntary NH to estimate the invisible reservoir of COVID-19 at the end of the lockdown.",

            "text": "These results suggest that 7/14 (50%) NH would have missed asymptomatic residents by testing professionals only to investigate around a positive resident. Half of NH would also miss cases by testing residents only. A quarter of NH would have missed one asymptomatic resident by testing all professionals only to investigate the spread around a positive professional. Three facilities would have missed from one to three asymptomatic professionals by testing residents only. Finally, 2/32 (6%) NH which performed a blinded universal testing without any known case would missed one case. In the literature, 40.7 to 57% of residents/staff tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in high prevalence NH were asymptomatic on the day of testing. [4] [5] [6] Our results suggest a higher rate of asymptomatic persons (41/50, 82%) in a low incidence context. Symptom-based screening of NH residents might fail to identify all SARS-CoV-2 infections. Asymptomatic NH residents and professionals might contribute to SARS-CoV-2 transmission. In a postlockdown context with an estimated mean daily incidence rate of 0.59 COVID-19 cases per 10 0.0 0 0 population, the universal screening in NH free of known positive case seems inefficient. In such context, supplies should be saved, and adverse effects (pain, complication of nasopharyngeal sampling, logistics, and costs) can be avoided. However, once a facility has confirmed a COVID-19 case, extensive testing should be performed for all professionals and residents, and all residents should be cared for using personal protective equipment.",

Our purpose was to document at the end of the Belgium epidemic the seroprevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in HCWs exposed to COVID-19 at varying degrees and to compare these rates with those observed by other teams worldwide. Another objective was to highlight SARS-CoV-2 carriage in a priori healthy staff members to sensitize them to the need to respect individual protection measures and distancing to avoid patient contamination.",

Health services had been overwhelmed by the rapid and widespread personto-person transmission, and could not be accessed due to strict quarantine, isolation, and lockdown policies. Internet hospitals provided telemedicine-based consultation for both COVID-19 and common chronic diseases, psychological counseling, and health education via smartphone apps and hospitals' official websites. 4 This is a possible solution to delivering routine health care without COVID-19 exposure risk and to avoiding unnecessary hospital consultations for patients with mild flu symptoms. During the epidemic, the health services delivery by Internet hospital increased 17 times over the same period last year. 5 From January 1 through April 30, 2020, a total of 146 Internet hospitals were launched, accounting for about 30% of the total. 6 Several innovations and collaborations empower Internet hospital to combat COVID-19. Artificial intelligence-aided online medical chatbots were employed to decrease physicians' workloads and to enhance capabilities to triage suspected patients. Blockchain companies and pharmacies were cooperated with Internet hospitals to deliver prescription drugs to patients' doorsteps. A large number of doctors, including medical students, newly registered at Internet hospitals, provided voluntary consultations and addressed public inquiries. The authorities issued regulations requiring that eligible \"Internet + \" medical service fees be covered in medical insurance payments. 7 Fact-check and information-release platforms reduce the spread of misinformation. We're not just fighting an epidemic; we're fighting an infodemic. 8 Digital social networks play an unprecedented role in health information communication because of physical distancing and near-complete global lockdown. Users in the selfmedia era increasingly see influencers within their peer networks as trustworthy sources of information. However, this method lacks expertise and responsibilities related to information inspection and dissemination, thus fostering the spread of misinformation which destabilizes public trust and further imperil public health. The Chinese governments and health bodies cooperated with social media giants Sina, and Tencent to take action to eliminate misinformation, such as flagging, fact-checking, and even removing false or outdated information, and to provide trustworthy sources of ongoing updates for COVID-19 about transmission, diagnosis, treatment, and policies. The fact-check and information-release platforms leverage their efforts to flatten the curve of misinformation and to elevate facts over fiction so as to not incite panic amongst the public. The databases include household registration information, drug purchase records, medical records, travel history and other data. Once on the phone, those passive data combined with active data reported by individuals can be displayed in the app or can be sent up to the cloud storage. This cloud \"backend\" stores data and can apply artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms as well as big data analytic techniques to generate predictions, visualizations, or decision support. The cloud output can then be delivered back and displayed on a mobile phone app or website that is accessible to individuals and available to the relevant personnel after authorized. Internet hospitals provided telemedicine-based consultation and medication delivery services, and the cost can be reimbursed by medical insurance. The governments and health agencies partnered with social media companies to eliminate misinformation and to provide trustworthy information. The integration of active self-reported health status and passive background creates an infection risk score system, also known as health QR codes. Now citizens are required to hold a \"green\" code for entering public facilities, workplaces, schools, or traveling.",

The health QR codes are generally divided into three colors: green, yellow, and red. Yellow or red indicates that the resident has not passed the health check because of one of the following reasons with 14 days: fever clinic visits records, fever-reducing drugs purchase records, travel history in high-risk regions, close contacts of confirmed or suspected cases, or physical symptoms when filling in an application form. 9 Now citizens are required to have a \"green\" code when entering public facilities, workplaces, or traveling. Active voluntarily self-reported data on health status via daily one-minute surveys complement passive background-based health QR codes. Besides, coronavirus nucleic acid detection and paper certificates were used as supplementary measures for those uncertain residents. The use of the health QR codes have overcome the fragmentation of traditional data collection and greatly promoted the government's precise measures in epidemic prevention and control and resumption of work and production in an orderly fashion.",

Due to the high infection rate of medical workers and the uncertainty of child-toperson transmission, we chose a special group of pediatric medical workers as the research subjects to investigate their infection status with SARS-CoV-2 and analyze possible causes.

Three different immunological detection methods were used to measure SARS-CoV-2 serum antibodies: colloidal gold-based detection, enzymelinked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and dual-target immunofluorescence assay (DTFA) (details in the Supplementary methods). The overall positive rate for SARS-CoV-2 IgG and IgM antibodies in the pediatric medical workers was 43.08 and 5.85%, respectively. For the close contact, non-close contact, and non-contact groups, respectively, the DTFA positive rates for IgG were 41.36, 14.68, and 12.50% ( p < 0.05), and the ELISA positive rates for IgG were 34.55, 10.91, and 4.17% ( p < 0.05) and 8.38, 0.91, and 0% for IgM ( p < 0.05). Colloidal gold detection results were negative for IgG and only two participants tested positive for IgM, both in the close contact group ( Table 1 ) .

We examined clinical notes to determine the reason for admission, which was categorised into six groups: acute COVID-19 infection; a complication from previous COVID-19 infection; incidental SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis with unrelated presentation; previous COVID-19 diagnosis not related to current admission; transfer into trust with pre-existing COVID-19 diagnosis; and no evidence of clinical or PCR diagnosis of COVID-19. Categorisation was determined based on presenting symptoms, imaging, blood results, and the medical notes. Fourteen miscategorised patients without clinical or laboratory evidence of COVID-19 were removed from the analysis.",

This was due to a fall in the numbers of true acute COVID-19 disease. However, admission figures appeared to be sustained by patients miscoded as acute COVID-19. These included patients with a historic diagnosis of COVID-19 readmitted with an unrelated condition; those admitted with complications of COVID-19 (e.g. venous thromboembolism, deconditioning); repatriations or inter-hospital transfers; or asymptomatic patients with an incidental finding of SARS-CoV-2 on naso-pharyngeal screening.",

In order to eliminate the influence of the fluorescence signal of enzymes, fluorescent probe is not included in first RPA reaction which is another important technical tips. And in the second RPA reaction, fluorescent probe will be added into reaction system.

The results of nestRPA assay showed that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid of these samples were 100% (14/14) positive. And then one positive sample (Szt_P_002) with the lowest Cq-value was selected to test the sensitivity of nestRPA technology. We found the detection result of Szt_P_002 sample was still positive after 11 times of 10-fold serial dilution by nestRPA assay, whilst after the fourth times of the same dilution fold, the result by qPCR test has been negative. Secondly, 101 samples from 73 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 were collected, all of which had negative results using qPCR, whilst 32.67% (33/101) of the samples were identified as by nestRPA assay. Furthermore, we collected 25 samples from 8 re-positive patients who repeatedly hospitalized suffering from COVID-19. Our results showed that 96.00% (24/25) of the samples tested positive by nestRPA whilst only 24.00% (6/25) of the samples were confirmed as positive by qPCR. These six samples with positive results by qPCR also had positive results by nestRPA. Our detection results were basically consistent with the clinical diagnosis results. Moreover, to explore whether there were asymptomatic patients with SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid positive in healthy population, we collected 32 nasal swabs samples from those returning to work, all of which the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection results were negative using qPCR. However, we found 12.50% (4/32) of the samples were positive using Fragment 5 and/or Fragment 7 by nestRPA ( Fig. 1 I) , which was consistent with those reported by other researchers [5] . Our results suggested that the ultra-sensitive nucleic acid detection technique has important implications for early identification of those asymptomatic carriers infected with SARS-CoV-2. Of course, in order to avoid false positive results, the target sequence of positive amplification products was 100% detected by high-throughput sequencing. In summary, 36.18% (55/152) of the samples with qPCR negative results were identified as positive by nestRPA technology in 172 clinical samples from 127 patients, which indicated the analytical sensitivity of nestRPA assay is much better than that of qPCR ( Fig. 1 J) .",

The sample collectors should fix the tongue with a spatula, and the sampling swab is used to scrape the cells from tonsil recess and lateral wall when sampling from the oropharynx [9] . However, the sample collectors were often fear of contagion with SARS-CoV-2.

First, the authors should have clarified how they defined VTE in their study since VTE, by definition, includes both PE and deep vein thrombosis (DVT). Second, the study by Klok et al. has been updated with 65 PE events and a total of 75 thrombotic events. 2 Third, to our knowledge, there are at least nine studies published before May 27th, 2020 that we identified on a similar search on May 26th, 2020 and that report extractable data on the incidence of PE and DVT and that the authors failed to include. (DVT, PE, other venous thromboses) in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 treated with standard of care anticoagulant prophylaxis and reported a cumulative incidence of 16%, 33%, and 42% on days 7, 14, and 21, respectively. 6 10 Based on the abundance of studies reporting on VTE incidence, the findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis should be considered with caution. The standard thromboprophylaxis doses seem inadequate to prevent VTE in critical or severe COVID-19, contributing to an unacceptably high rate of thromboembolic events. Ongoing prospective randomized trials (NCT04401293, NCT04359277) are already enrolling patients and will hopefully elucidate the role of higher heparin doses for the prevention of thromboembolic events in COVID-19. Future, well-designed systematic reviews that include the constantly increasing literature on VTE will provide further insights into the actual incidence of COVID-19 associated DVT and PE.",

In this Journal, Iwasaki and colleagues compared the quality of PCR from saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs as a diagnostic measure of SARS-CoV-2 infection 1 . Currently, the standard for diagnosis of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection is a positive result based on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test from nasopharyngeal swab samples. PCR test is also used as a guide for patient discharge from designated hospitals and medical institutions. We recently experienced a case of a 97-year-old female who was diagnosed with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Although her clinical symptoms and radiological findings resolved within a few days, PCR results from nasopharyngeal swab samples remained positive for 50 days after the onset. This case prompted us to conduct a retrospective study of the association of age the duration of positive PCR testing. We specifically hypothesized that old age could be a risk for prolonged duration of positive PCR results from nasopharyngeal swab samples. This study was approved by the ethics committees of National Hospital Organization Hokkaido Medical Center and Hokkaido University Hospital. Nasopharyngeal swab sample was collected and quantitative real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was conducted as described before 1 . In a RT-PCR assay, cycle threshold (Ct) value is defined as the number of cycles required for the fluorescent signal to cross a baseline threshold.

However, as per the statements of and guidance from the World Health Organization (WHO) 2 , patients are discharged only upon confirmed negative PCR tests of nasopharyngeal swabs taken on two sequential days. This results in prolonged hospital stays as patients remain in beds in the designated infectious disease units designed for acute and ongoing care. In our analysis, older age is significantly associated with prolonged duration of positive PCR tests from nasopharyngeal swab samples, irrespective of the disease severity and the used of medication ( Fig. 1 ) . The reasons underlying these observations remain unclear. Of note, we recently reported that quality of PCR from saliva as a diagnostic measure of SARS-CoV-2 infection was equivalent to that of the samples from nasopharyngeal swabs 1 . We also found that findings from PCR tests reverted from positive to negative much more quickly when using saliva than nasopharyngeal samples 1 . We speculate that in older individuals, cell turnover is less robust and as such, clearance of virus from the nasopharynx is prolonged; these factors may lead to positive PCR tests that persist after acute disease has resolved.",

In particular, elderly patients who are likely to deteriorate will need to be rapidly identified. 2 Existing prognostic models for COVID-19 based on clinical, laboratory and radiological variables are at high risk of bias. 3 In the UK, the National Early Warning Score (NEWS) and its updated version NEWS2 -an a priori weighted composition of the patient's observations -is used routinely to monitor patients in hospital and identify early those who may deteriorate. 4 Compared to other early warning scores, the NEWS Score has a greater ability to discriminate patients at risk of cardiac arrest, unanticipated intensive care unit admission or death. 5 Currently, guidance from the National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) supports the use of the NEWS2 score to risk assess patients with COVID-19 in the community, who may require hospitalisation. 6 In a recent rapid review, Greenhalgh and colleagues do not recommend using the NEWS2 Score alone for risk assessment of patients with COVID-19 in the community. 7 Blood pressure and oxygen saturation measurements are difficult to take remotely. The score also does not include age or comorbidities, strong independent predictors of survival in patients with COVID-19. The value of the NEWS2 Score in predicting outcome in patients admitted to hospital with COVDI-19 remains uncertain.",

All patients who were unsuitable for escalation to intensive care and received wardbased care as per NICE rapid guidance for COVID-19. 5 The majority of patients died (N = 10, 59%). Compared to patients who survived, those who died were more likely to be male, with bilateral consolidation on chest radiographs on admission. Admission SARS-CoV-2 quantitative PCR Ct values on nasopharyngeal swab did not seem to relate to survival. All patients who died required some form of oxygen therapy, ranging from nasal canulae to non-invasive ventilation through continuous positive airway pressure. Less than half of those who survived required oxygen therapy, all of which were delivered via nasal canulae. Fig. 1 shows the trend in the National Early Warning Score2 (NEWS2) throughout hospitalisation, stratified by severity of NEWS2 on admission and clinical outcome. First, we found that the initial NEWS2 score did not predict mortality. For example, four out of the ten patients (40%) who died presented with a NEWS2 score of 0-3 while three out of seven patients (43%) who survived presented with a NEW2 Score of 5 or above. Secondly, there was no significant difference in the admission NEWS2 score and its components, between patients who died and those who survived, apart from systolic blood pressure. ( Table 1 ) . Thirdly, examining the NEWS2 scores over time, patients who died had a higher variability in their scores compared to those who survived. Seven out of ten patients (70%) who died had a maximum daily change in NEWS2 score of over 5, while none of those who survived had such dramatic fluctuations. ( Fig. 1 ) In our small pilot of elderly patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, admission NEWS2 scores did not seem to be useful in predicting clinical outcomes. For some patients, death occurred regardless of admission NEWS scores and without a prior deteriorating trend. Originally, the NEWS score was developed using data from 35585 acute hospital admissions, most of whom would have had an underlying diagnosis of sepsis. 8 Sepsis is a clinical syndrome caused by overwhelming systemic bacterial infection. Clinical deterioration is seen within days in hospital. However, COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, a coronavirus which predominately appears to affect the respiratory system as an initial viral pneumonitis. In China, a fifth of all COVID-19 inpatients rapidly became critically ill with hypoxia and respiratory failure. 9 The weighting of the NEWS2 score does not account for the degree of supplemental oxygen (FiO2) a patient may require, thus limiting its utility to identify early deterioration in patients with COVID-19. In our cohort, patient 8 had a NEWS2 score of 2 on day 2 and 3 despite requiring a large increase in FiO2 (from room air to 60%). A more sensitive early warning score for COVID-19 needs to be urgently developed and validated.",

Extensive RT-PCR testing by has been key to clinical decision-making, epidemiological analysis and policy development during the current severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic. The majority of RT-PCR assays target the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), envelope protein (E) or nucleocapsid protein (N) genes [2] . However, initial testing algorithms and expert opinion from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) advised that E gene amplification in isolation should be treated cautiously, due to concerns of non-specificity and issues related to contamination of reagents [3] . Early experience at Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust (UK) on serially sampled patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection suggested that E gene detection persists beyond RdRp detection, and may offer enhanced diagnostic sensitivity. Therefore we explored the significance of E gene de-tection in relation to RdRp, and in the absence of RdRp detection in a retrospective evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR testing.",

Due to the unique transcription strategy of coronaviruses, genes towards the 3' end of the genome would be present in higher copy numbers during active viral replication, which could explain these findings [5] . It is also possible that PCR optimised conditions in a multiplex system favours E gene amplification, however we found no significant loss of RdRp detection when comparing single and multiplex systems during validation, with observed CT rises averaging 1-2 cycles (data not shown).

In addition, the application of host-directed therapy and early control of viral replication might be crucial for improving the prognosis of COVID-19. We are interested in investigating the potential risk factors associated with the progression and prognosis of COVID-19. To date, cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and influenza A co-infection have been reported in COVID-19 patients.

[1] Despite the rapidly growing knowledge base on the clinical course of the disease, no therapeutic agents have been proven to be effective for COVID-19. Further clarification of the clinical course of the disease could help in the development of effective treatment strategies. Wang and colleagues in their recent elegant study to investigate characteristics and prognostic factors in 339 elderly patients with COVID-19, observed a high proportion of severe and critical cases as well as high fatality rates. [2] Common complications included bacterial infection, acute respiratory distress syndrome as well as liver enzyme abnormalities. In their analyses to explore prognostic factors for fatal outcomes, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (known markers of liver injury) were not found to be independently associated with the risk of mortality. Though it has been reported that liver injury is more prevalent in severe cases of COVID-19, [ 3 , 4 ] whether circulating levels of markers of liver injury at admission could predict clinical outcomes in COVID-19 patients is uncertain. In this context, we aimed to determine the nature of the relationships of admission levels of five main markers of liver injury (ALT, AST, gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and total bilirubin) with the risk of clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 using a systematic meta-analysis.",

The likely explanation for the worse outcomes observed in patients with baseline elevated markers of liver injury (as seen in chronic liver disease) could be attributed to compromised immune status. [ 3 , 4 ] Irrespective of the fact that about 2-11% of patients with COVID-19 have liver comorbidities, [3] COVID-19 also causes liver injury. However, there is controversy regarding the causes of liver injury in COVID-19. [ 3 , 4 ] Proposed explanations include (i) druginduced liver injury; (ii) direct injury to the liver due to COVID-19 hepatitis [4] ; (iii) COVID-19 induced myositis [4] ; (iv) binding of SARS CoV-2 directly to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (v) hepatic congestion due to high levels of positive end expiratory pressure during mechanical ventilation; [4] and (vi) aggravation of liver injury by SARS CoV-2 in patients with pre-existing viral hepatitis. [ 7 , 8 ] In the absence of robust association studies and formal risk prediction analyses, the overall evidence suggests that increased baseline levels of markers of liver injury could predict poor outcomes. The global prevalence of chronic liver disease remains high and continues to increase. Treatment options for COVID-19 are currently supportive; hence, there should be more intensive monitoring of levels of markers of liver injury during admission so that therapeutic approaches can be individually tailored.",

Several evidences showed that lymphopenia could have a prog- nostic value in COVID-19 [1] , in addition to its diagnostic value, already recognized in Chinese guidelines [6] . Interestingly, in our work total white cells count was more associated with a diagnosis of COVID-19 than lymphocytes count. This could be related with an overall low severity spectrum of disease shown by our patients (only a half of COVID-19 patients had interstitial pneumonia at admission). CRP, epidemiological link, clinical symptoms and time since symptoms onset were also associated with the pretest probability of COVID-19. Particularly, the derived predictionrule showed higher utility in ruling-out COVID-19 diagnosis: in the derivation and validation groups only 1 of 21 (4.8%) and 2 of 29 (6.9%) patients with a score of less than -1 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Despite its intrinsic limitations (retrospective data collection, derivation and validation cohorts belonging to the same hospital), our works represents to our knowledge the first attempt to measure the impact of an easily-available score for stratifying the risk of COVID-19. This could represent an important tool for assisting clinicians as well for driving hospital policies of infection control, particularly in resource-limited settings.",

She presented in the hospital with fever, dry cough, and deteriorated dyspnea for 10 days on 29 January 2020. On admission, her vital signs were unstable (temperature 39 \u00b0C, heart rate 112 beats per minute, respiratory rate 32 breaths per minute, blood pressure 104/65 mmHg) with obvious dyspnea (SpO2 89% under conventional oxygen therapy of 40% FiO2). Laboratory results indicated leukopenia (2.65 \u00d7 10 9 /L), lymphopenia (0.45 \u00d7 10 9 /L), elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) (102 mg/L), IL-6 (62 pg/ml) and ddimer (1.06 mg/L). Arterial blood gas analysis (ABGA) reported impaired oxygenation of PaO2/FiO2 at 213 mmHg. The diagnostic RT-PCR on a nasopharyngeal swab specimen was positive for SARS-CoV-2 and a chest CT scan illustrated bilateral pneumonia ( Fig. 1 a) . Lopinavir-ritonavir (500 mg, twice per day) was administrated immediately. Her condition progressed rapidly on illness day 12 and she required intubation and mechanic ventilation because of severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 92 mmHg). On illness day 17, both oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 348 mmHg) and chest CT significantly improved ( Fig. 1 b) , and she was then weaned from mechanical ventilation. She was discharged on illness day 21 with mild lung abnormalities on chest CT images ( Fig. 1 c) . One month later after discharge, both chest CT scan ( Fig. 1 d) and pulmonary function test (forced vital capacity (FVC) of predicted 103.7%, FEV1/FVC 84.64%, carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO) of predicted 94%) indicated no-abnormalities. Patient 2 was a 68-year old man who permanently resides in Fuyang. He visited the hospital because of fever (37.5 \u00b0C) and cough for one week on 4 February 2020. The nasopharyngeal swab was positive for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR and a chest CT revealed bilateral ground-glass opacity ( Fig. 2 a) . Laboratory results indicated leukopenia (3.33 \u00d7 109/L), lymphopenia (0.55 \u00d7 109/L), elevated CRP (116 mg/L), and IL-6 (357 pg/ml). His-condition was stable on admission, with oxygen saturation of 97% on ambient air. Lopinavir-ritonavir (500 mg, twice per day) was administrated. He reported the history of hypertension and diabetes for around 10 years, blood pressure and glucose were controlled well, no history of chronic respiratory diseases. On illness day 12, he was transferred to the intensive care unit and converted to invasive mechanical ventilation because of worsening oxygenation (PaO2/FiO2 84 mmHg) and progressing abnormalities on chest CT scan with extensive ground-glass opacities and partial consolidation on bilateral lungs ( Fig. 2 b) . His-oxygenation improved slowly, but could not be weaned from mechanic ventilation, hence he received a tracheostomy on illness day 22. During this period, bronchoalveolar lavage culture reported Escherichia coli that was sensitive to carbapenems but resistant against third-generation cephalosporins. Therefore, imipenem was administrated. On illness day 30, oxygenation of the patient suddenly deteriorated, and a chest CT scan revealed right-sided pneumothorax ( Fig. 2 c) . The patient then received thoracic drainage with a closed system which was removed 2 days later. On illness day 35, the oxygenation of the patient im- proved and he was successfully weaned from mechanic ventilation. He was discharged from hospital on illness day 45 with obvious abnormalities on the chest CT scan ( Fig. 2 d) . Because of the impaired pulmonary function on discharge, he was transferred to a rehabilitation center. Two months after the onset of illness, he went to the hospital for the first follow-up visit. The pulmonary function test indicated restrictive lung function defect, with decreased FVC of predicted (62.3%) and DLCO of predicted (49.6%), but FEV1/FVC was at the normal range of 80.1%, which was consistent with the manifestations on chest CT images ( Fig. 2 e) . On the second follow-up visit (3 months after illness onset), almost all ground-glass opacities were dissolved, but with obvious architectural distortion, bronchial dilatation and volume loss in bilateral lungs suggestive of fibrotic changes on chest CT ( Fig. 2 f) . Lung ventilation was worse than that of the previous month, featured as the restrictive pulmonary disease with decreased FVC of predicted (54%), but diffusion capacity improved significantly, albeit it was still lower than that of the normal range (DLCO of predicted increased from 49.6% to 64.3%). The patient complained of shortness of breath and general weakness (6-minute walking distance was 200 m), and ABGA indicated low PaO2 (61.6 mmHg) on ambient air.",

The results of the older patient in this study, suggest that a proportion of severe COVID-19 patients developed fibrosis. Similar fibrotic changes had been reported for SARS, which seem to have the ability of self-rehabilitation as gradual improvements were observed over time. 6 , 7 Nevertheless, the restrictive ventilatory defect and impaired diffusion capacity still affect the patient's physical abilities significantly in the early recovering stage, which suggests the importance of early rehabilitation. 8 The limitation of this study was the short-term follow-up of only two cases; therefore, to understand any long-term effects of COVID-19, long-term follow-up studies with large cohorts of patients are warranted.",

The use of rapid molecular methods in the diagnosis and prevention of transmission of tuberculosis is recommended by both NICE 2 and Public Health England, 3 but adoption of these recommendations around the country is variable. Variation may relate to confidence in using rapid molecular methods as much of the data to support use comes from areas with a high incidence of tuberculosis. In 2017, Parcell Benjamin et al. 4 demonstrated, in their cohort in a low prevalence area, that sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF (Cepheid) was 95.8%.

The aim was to establish the sensitivity of Xpert MTB/RIF in a low prevalence setting in England. We performed a retrospective analysis of all samples processed using Xpert MTB/Rif since the initiation of testing in our laboratory. Over the two and half years a total of 126 samples were processed ( Fig. 1 ) . In the final analysis we included 80 specimens.",

In comparison the sensitivity of smears using culture as the gold standard was 82.9% (95% CI 0.687-0.915). This evaluation demonstrates that the use of Xpert MTB/RIF on a selected population is more sensitive than using smear. This could help time to treatment. Furthermore, the samples used for testing included sputum and non-sputum samples ",

Like Peiris and al. suggested with the SARS-CoV1, we believe that an effective antiviral agent is needed to decrease the viral load and direct cytolytic damage during the first phase of infection, and in turn reduce the immunologic storm during the second phase with the risk of progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome ( 3 ) . Among existing antiviral therapeutics tested, protease inhibitors seemed promising, and ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) has been shown to inhibit the replication of SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in hospitalized patients (4) (5) (6) .Here we report the viral dynamics in multiple clinical samples in regards to pharmacological LPV/r levels during and after treatment in a SARS-CoV-2-infected patient. This first SARS-CoV-2 infection in a French resident was diagnosed in our department on January 29th 2020, six days after his exposure to a laboratoryconfirmed case from Asia ( 7 ).We performed monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 infection from day 2 (D2) after onset of symptoms in different sequential clinical samples by real-time RT-PCR targeting E gene ( 8 ) . Viral loads were estimated with the cycle threshold (Ct) values: Ct > 50 was considered as negative. Detection of specific antibodies was performed on plasma specimens with the Abbott SARS-CoV-2 IgG assay. When chest CT-scan confirmed small areas of ground-glass opacities in both lower lungs on D9, the patient started ritonavirboosted lopinavir (LPV/r) 40 0/10 0 mg BID until hospital discharge on D18. LPV plasma concentration (C min ) was measured by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry method (LC-MS/MS); the limit of quantification (LOQ) was 15 ng/mL.The outcome of the patient was good. He experienced the typical pattern of COVID-19 symptoms, such as sore throat, muscle pain, headaches and anosmia, then lung infection signs but did not develop severe pneumonia and never required supportive treatments with oxygen or immunomodulators. During the whole period of viral monitoring, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected not only in nasopharyngeal swab (NPS), but also in induced sputum, saliva, plasma, and stool ( Fig. 1 ) . However, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was never detected in urine. The whole genome sequence obtained from positive NPS sample is available in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) with the sequence number EPI_ISL_408,431. Between D2 and D4, high viral loads (Ct < 30) were detected in NPS, induced sputum, saliva, and plasma. Viral load decreased gradually in NPS to become undetectable on D15, after 6 days of treatment. In plasma, after a rapid initial drop, a low-level rebound (Ct > 35) occurred on D11 and D12, corresponding to a transient plateau in NPS. This phenomenon was observed between 2 and 3 days after the start of LPV/r treatment and despite expected LPV C min . On D14, SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still detected at high level (Ct < 30) in sputum, but at low level (Ct > 35) in NPS, illustrating differential compartmentalization of SARS-CoV-2 in upper and lower respiratory tracts. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected once in stool sample on D23, after LPV/r removal. Further additional samples (i.e., NPS, saliva, plasma and stool) collected on D30 and D90 were negative for SARS-CoV-2. In terms of immunity, IgG seroconversion was evidenced on D16 ( Fig. 1 ) .In a retrospective cohort study, 96 patients infected with SARS-CoV-2, the median duration of virus detection in NPS samples varied from 14 to 21 days according to disease severity ( 9 ) . A recent study showed that SARS-CoV-2 RNA could not be detected in NPS from half of non-severe patients after 14 days of LPV/r treatment ( 10 . However, in a randomized trial involving 199 patients, LPV/r treatment did not significantly improve clinical symptoms or survival, nor diminish throat viral RNA detectability in late-presenters patients with severe pneumonia ( 11 ). Interestingly, in a post-hoc analysis of the subgroup of patients treated less than 12 days after the onset of symptoms, clinical cure was obtained after 16 days in the LPV/r arm versus 17 days and the mortality rate was 19.0% versus 27.1%, without statistical significance, possibly due to the weak study power. In our study, the viral clearance in NPS of this single patient was obtained within 2 weeks, coinciding with the antibody response (D16). The rebound of viral load observed in NPS during treatment could be explained by the transient subtherapeutic levels of LPV/r between D13 and D15. The SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR became positive in stool only after the end of treatment, addressing the question of longer treatment need for oro-fecal transmission prevention.Our findings suggest that, if LPV/r treatment does not seem to constitute the treatment of choice for salvage therapy in patients with severe COVID-19, it could be effective in early presenting nonsevere patients to decrease the SARS-CoV-2 load and to prevent the secondary immune-related severe evolution.Ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV/r) use in SARS-CoV-2 s infected patients should be better evaluated in a prospective controlled study including multisite drug dosages and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) study, and treatment should be given for at least 14 days to reduce long-term viral carriage and related transmission risks.",

The Infectious Diseases Department obtained the clearance from the Hospital's Ethic Committee to proceed with COVID-19 cohort follow-up. 9 demonstrated that, patients whose biopsy samples underwent molecular testing waited significantly less time to start treatment. The negative predictive value of molecular testing also makes it a valuable tool for infection control. At present the smear is the investigation of choice used to judge the relative infectivity of a patient. We propose that to judge infectivity a smear could be performed on a sample that is positive by molecular testing. This would reduce the number of smears needed and therefore reduce the workload in many routine microbiology laboratories.",

These laboratories could use Xpert MTB/RIF as the level of experience required for a smear is not required for a test. Furthermore, the recommendation to report smears within 24 h, six days a week is often not met due to the time taken to perform smears. The main concern with such a move is the positive predictive value of the test is influenced by the prevalence of tuberculosis in the population. Indiscriminate use could generate false positives. The results of our evaluation and the other limited data available from low prevalence settings demonstrate that where the clinical suspicion is high then the use of molecular testing may be more efficient than using smears as first line testing.",
