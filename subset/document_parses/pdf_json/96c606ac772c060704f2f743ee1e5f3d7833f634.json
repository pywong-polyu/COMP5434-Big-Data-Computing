We examined effective reproduction numbers (R e , 0.9-2.0) at which policy conclusions would change. We assumed homogeneous mixing among the Massachusetts population (excluding those residing in long-term care facilities). We used published data on disease progression and mortality, transmission, PCR sensitivity/specificity (70/100%) and costs. Model-projected outcomes included infections, deaths, tests performed, hospital-days, and costs over 180-days, as well as incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER, $/quality-adjusted life-year [QALY]).",

            "text": "Massachusetts experienced a major COVID-19 outbreak beginning in March 2020 after a biotechnology convention, which was subsequently fueled by transmission in communities living in multi-generational and multi-family housing [1] . In the United States, restricted testing capacity early in the pandemic led states such as Massachusetts to test only severely symptomatic people and/or those with a known exposure [2] . While some have argued that testing must be highly sensitive in order to be of value to guide reopening [3] , others have argued that sensitivity can be sacrificed if tests are rapid, low-cost, and frequent [4, 5] . Despite the variable clinical sensitivity of SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, expanded testing programs could reduce transmissions by increasing isolation of infectious people, thereby reducing hospitalizations and deaths. Widely available testing could also allow for the safer resumption of economic and social activity by providing surveillance for any -second wave\u2016 of infection [6] . Such resumptions of public life may also benefit those with non-COVID-related health issues who may avoid seeking care due to concerns about acquiring COVID-19 [7] .",

For those who are not hospitalized, we assume a positive PCR test leads to selfisolation in the community. We projected clinical outcomes (infections, COVID-19-related mortality, quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), and COVID-19-related resource utilization (tests, hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) beds, self-isolation days), and costs for Massachusetts (6.9 million people, excluding long-term care facility residents) over a 180-day horizon. We report incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER: difference in cost divided by difference in quality-adjusted life-years [$/QALY]) from a healthcare sector perspective (Supplementary Methods). The threshold at which interventions are considered cost-effective is a normative value that varies by setting; for the sake of interpretability, we define a strategy as -cost-effective\u2016 if its ICER is below $100,000/QALY [10] .",

The frequency of repeat testing with Symptomatic+asymptomatic-monthly is also influential; in the surging scenario, Symptomatic+asymptomatic-monthly would no longer be cost-effective if tests occur more frequently than every 30 days (Supplementary Table 13 ), however if test costs were \u2264$3, then testing as frequently as every 14-days would be cost-effective in all epidemic scenarios (Figure 2 ).

Given the average time from infection to hospitalization and death (~9 days and ~28 days, respectively), earlier expanded testing might also have facilitated timely recognition of epidemic trends and closure policies. Policies that reduce R e at scale (e.g., stay-at-home advisories), as occurred in Massachusetts even while PCR testing was scarce, are likely to be more effective than any of the modeled testing strategies [30, 31] . Similar to conclusions from other studies [27, [32] [33] [34] [35] , our findings suggest that looser restrictions on social distancing regulations (which can lead to a higher R e ) would require more aggressive testing, paired with individual behavioral measures, to control the epidemic.",

ICERs were highly sensitive to PCR test costs. If low-cost testing were available at $5/test, it would be cost-effective or cost-saving to offer repeat testing in all epidemic scenarios.

However, in the surging scenario, the projected average of 203,100 tests/day (36.6 million/180 days) required to conduct the cost-effective Symptomatic+asymptomatic-monthly strategy would greatly exceed current capacity; notably, daily testing of the entire population in this scenario led to >3 million projected tests/day.

Newer high throughput machines may process thousands of tests per day, rendering such an approach potentially feasible in the near future [38] . Additionally, the number of tests used for people without COVID-19 is uncertain; we assumed high rates of COVID-like-illness (adding approximately 2,800 tests/day) in the base case, however, it is likely, particularly in summer months, that fewer people would seek testing. Given that the economically preferred strategy changes depending on R e , implementation of the most cost-effective testing strategy will require careful planning and realtime epidemic monitoring in each setting to adapt to changing R e . Furthermore, while currently an aspiration, low-cost, rapid turnaround testing, even with current imperfect test sensitivity would be cost-effective even in low R e settings. While critical supply chain issues and other factors precluded widespread testing in the US early in the pandemic, even now, expanding testing capacity must remain a focus of national efforts. Given that scaling current technologies may not be feasible in all settings, additional innovative strategies including pooled-, rapid antigen-and home self-testing, should be examined [39, 40] .",

Compared to testing only those with severe symptoms, monthly routine testing averted only 58-64% of infections, whereas daily testing averted 75-91% of A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 17 infections. Our results emphasize how policies that support isolating people infected with COVID-19 are essential; when an individual is less adherent to self-isolation after a positive test (i.e., lower transmission reduction), the benefits of testing are greatly reduced. In Iceland, broad testing led to only 6% of the population being tested, with 34% of an invited random sample presenting for testing [41] . In the surging scenario, at low test acceptance rates (15%) among those with no or mild symptoms, Symptomatic+asymptomatic-monthly would no longer be costeffective. In Massachusetts, SARS-CoV-2 testing often does not require co-pays, and sufficient personal protective equipment permits safe testing [1, 2] . Nevertheless, people may avoid testing due to concerns such as physical discomfort, missing work, or stigma. While the Family Medical and Leave Act may provide support for those eligible who test positive (or if family members test positive), not all workers may be aware of their rights or have compliant employers [42] .",

This analysis has important limitations. First, we assume homogenous population mixing. This assumption may over-or under-estimate the benefits of PCR testing; however, we have calibrated our model to reflect observed data, using a transmission multiplier. When relevant, we selected values or made assumptions which would provide a conservative estimate of the benefits of testing (PCR sensitivity, test cost, transmission reduction after a negative test), and then varied these values widely in sensitivity analyses. Second, we do not address supply chain lapses which could impact the feasibility of implementing these strategies. Third, we exclude several factors that may result from expanded testing that would render these strategies even more cost-effective, including averting quality-of-life reductions due to COVID-related morbidity or self-quarantine-related mental health issues [44] , preventing school closure-related workforce gaps [45] , increasing economic purchasing, and enabling economic activity to A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 18 reopen due to reduced COVID incidence [33] . We also assume that transmissions vary with a constant daily rate by disease state; emerging data suggest that infectivity may be highest early after acquisition of the virus [46] . If true, testing strategies which diagnose people in early or asymptomatic stages of infection would be of higher value. Finally, we do not model contact tracing, which is likely to be a critical tool to respond to a patchwork of surging outbreaks over time.",
