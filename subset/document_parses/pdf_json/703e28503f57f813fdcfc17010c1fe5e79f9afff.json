We investigated the prevalence of swallowing problems in an unselected cohort of people aged 18-65 years. Methods The EAT-10 Assessment Tool was converted into an anonymized online survey. Invitations were e-mailed to author contacts and onwards dispersal encouraged. Analysis was performed using non-parametric test for group comparison (Mann-Whitney U) and Spearman's rho correlation. Results From March 2014 to October 2017: 2054 responses (32 reported ages outside of 18-65 or undeclared) from Africa, Asia, Australasia/Oceania, Europe, and North and South America. Responses: 1,648 female, 364 male, (10 reported as both), median age 34, (range 18-65, mean 37.12, SD 12.40) years. Total EAT-10 scores: median 0 (range 0-36, mean 1.57, SD 3.49). EAT-10 score \u2265 3 (337) median 5 (range 3-36, mean 7.02 SD 5.91). Median age 36 (range 19-65, mean 37.81, SD 13.21) years. Declared sex was not statistically significantly associated with non-pathological vs. pathological EAT-10 score (p = 0.665). Female scores (median 0.00, mean 1.56, SD 3.338) were significantly higher than for males (median 0.00, mean 1.62, SD 4.161): U (Nfemale = 1648, Nmale = 364) = 275,420.000, z = \u2212 2.677, p = 0.007. Age and EAT-10 score were not associated: females r s = \u2212 0.043, p = 0.079, N = 1648, males r s = \u2212 0.003, p = 0.952, N = 364. Considerable impact on people: \"I take ages to eat a main course \u2026 This is embarrassing and I often leave food even though I am still hungry.\" (no diagnosis, EAT-10 = 17). Conclusion Concerns regarding swallowing exist in people undiagnosed with dysphagia, who may feel uncomfortable seeking professional help. Dysphagia may be under reported resulting in a hidden population. Subtle changes are currently seen as subtle markers of COVID-19. Further work is required to ensure that what is an essentially normal swallow does not become medicalized.",

Swallowing is a complex multiphase neuro-muscular function, the main purpose of which is to transfer the food or drink (hereafter referred as simply a bolus) safely from the mouth to the stomach. Swallowing is a programmed activity with the primary control being in the brainstem. Cortical input modifies how the bolus moves through the oropharyngeal system depending on the bolus characteristics and number [3] . A safe swallow entails co-ordination between what are typically referred to as the various phases of the swallow [4] and the respiratory cycle [5] . Failure for this to happen will result in problems swallowing (dysphagia). Oropharyngeal dysphagia may be a result of problems with neurological control, muscular control, obstruction, or breathing (cardiorespiratory) [6] .",

We need to be careful to not go looking for a problem that does not exist or medicalizing the ends of the range of what is normal. Of merit to consider is that the swallow is a finely tuned process involving several systems and as such problems may show subtle pre-existing conditions or herald the onset of certain diseases before other signs. In pseudo-bulbar type motor neuron disease or tiny lacunar type strokes, a change in the swallow may be the first or only sign due to the need for fine co-ordination of systems. Indeed in the current COVID-19 pandemic, evidence is emerging that subtle signs such as taste and smell may be affected early in the disease [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] . Taste and smell are inherent components of the sensory system involved in preparing the gastro-intestinal tract to receive, transport, and process each bolus [25] . More obvious issues are clear when we consider what happens to the interplay between breathing and swallowing in conditions including corona virus respiratory infections.",

Secondarily to educate professionals to ask about how people are managing with eating and drinking. This is difficult in the absence of obvious disease. We in the dysphagia community understand the subtleties and relationship of aspects of the swallow to other areas of health and illness, but not everyone does. Education of the broader health care community is an ongoing process, although promise is being shown by early work such as the 4QT [37] . This tool is designed to be quick and used by any member of a health care team. The 4QT is still in the pilot stage with good sensitivity but poor specificity, which in a screen designed to detect issues for onward assessment is not a bad thing.",
