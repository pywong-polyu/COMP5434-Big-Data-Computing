This independence is important in protecting the respondent from the influences of fellow experts'opinion and of dominant voices that may occur in face-to-face meetings. 4 This study aimed to provide a consensus from a panel of international experts about the regulation, sale, use, addiction potential of ENDS and HTP as well as research questions.",

We, therefore, used a different strategy in the second round questionnaire. If the question was Open access categorical, we asked for a binary response (agree/don't agree). Some first round questions had several items with binary answer; we transformed these multiple item categorical responses to a hierarchical Likert scale of preference: 'most preferred answer (1)-less preferred answer (5)'. This more constraining strategy of answers while keeping the same questions intended to make emerge more consensual answers.

ENDS should not be regulated as consumer products but either as a new category of nicotine delivery or tobacco products; ENDS should not be sold in general stores but in specialised shops, shops selling tobacco or in pharmacies with restriction on sale to minors. Administration of illegal drugs is likely with ENDS. Concerning HTP products, a consensus occurred that HTP products have the same addictive potential as cigarettes; they should be regulated as a tobacco product with similar warning messages as cigarettes and their advertisement should not be allowed. The experts agreed that ENDS and HTP use should not be allowed in indoor public places and a specific tax should be implemented for ENDS; taxes on HTP should not be lower than those for conventional cigarettes. There was an agreement that the use of cigarettes is more likely with both ENDS and HTP (dual use) than quitting smoking.",
