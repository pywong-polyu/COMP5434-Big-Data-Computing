            "text": "During crisis, practices are turbulent, and an individual's interest is often at odds with collective interests. 1 The concept of emotional intelligence (EI) is normally associated with practice, and particularly within the scope of nursing, reflective of traumatic impact on various job experiences. 2 Currently, EI is widely regarded as a central measurement affecting job performance (JP). 3, 4 This could be demonstrated as EI describes an individual's ability to manage emotions alongside cognitive processes as a means of motivating themselves with respect to both distal and proximal goals. 5, 6 To manage and work with one's emotions, the effective practice of EI is something that can be taught, and Goleman argues that it ought to be a dominant component of professional development initiatives. He is convinced that job-specific expertise alone cannot improve performance. Rather, increased levels of EI are necessary to allow individuals to use novel skills successfully. Improving EI can thus drive balanced increases in both professional success and social performance. 6, 7 Goleman's effort has been the subject of significant research over the last two decades. A review of the current literature indicates that fundamental levels of EI may vary among practitioners of different professions, especially among healthcare professionals. 8 In addition, some components of EI are individual-centered; everyone is intrinsically motived by certain psychological stages like confidence, confrontation, and the nature of stressors such as absenteeism and traumas. 9, 10 The same is true for healthcare providers, who rely on EI to a high degree. This is absolute for those especially in positions requiring direct contact with patients, like physicians and nurses. Each healthcare position requires a specific set of competencies, and particularly human resources for employees to function adequately, and EI plays a substantial role among these. 11 In the healthcare context, in order to understand the factors driving institutional success, it is also imperative to accurately assess levels of JP. This can be understood as an attitude reflecting how an employee feels about their current job, and normally summarizes how the individual relates to the various aspects of their position. 12 Additionally, JP is a reflection of how healthcare providers contribute effectively to their teams and is regarded as contingent on both internal satisfaction and EI. 13 In social and professional psychology, EI is regarded as a fundamental predictor of organizational outcomes, especially JP. For instance, emotions play a vital role in the practice of nursing, which demands both technical and psychological forms of expertise in patient care. 14 Therefore, an individual who can thrive in a nursing role, and coordinate closely with doctors and other healthcare providers, is necessarily someone with sufficient EI to recognize and take advantage of his/her sentiments and thoughts. 15 In addition, the nursing profession is predominantly female, and previous studies indicate that women have higher average EI than men. 14, 15 The relationship between EI and JP is not a novel topic of study, as several previous investigations have attempted to better understand EI's involvement in moderating performance in the workplace. Several studies have explored quantifiable links between the indices and other characteristics that collectively lead to productive, professional, and economic activity. 16, 17 Also, previous studies have dealt primarily with management in general, but some have addressed healthcare services, including the field of nursing. In both contexts, EI is considered to be one of the main elements responsible for shaping performance. 18 However, agreement is less widespread beyond this basic point. Since the emergence of EI as a concept, some health organizational behavioral researchers have reported varying results with respect to its effects on organizational culture. 19, 20 Some studies have argued that EI is more valuable than technical skills or cognitive abilities. [21] [22] [23] For instance, social consciousness and relationship management are indispensable skills for successful leadership in any domain. 24, 25 These skills include elements of cooperation, team awareness, conflict management, and sympathy. 26 According to EI theory, leaders evincing these abilities have far-reaching effects on their organizations. Senior healthcare executives with high EI influence intermediate managers, who in turn influence onthe-ground staff members; in hospitals, these are the frontline caregivers. Trivellas et al investigated the impact of EI on organizational performance among nursing staff working in the healthcare sector and found a strong impact of EI on organizational performance linked directly to retention and job commitment. 27 However, more exposure to crisis may lead to less EI among nurses, and in particular those in medical sections. 28, 29 The Saudi healthcare system confronted a pandemic in early 2020; the government has taken serious measures to minimize risks including partial, then full, curfew, and encouraging social distancing policy. 30, 31 This has led to pressure on healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, as they represent the first line against such risk. 32 Their personal and social needs were drastically affected by many patients admitted to the hospitals.

The secondary objective was to explore the effects of EI on JP when dealing with such a crisis. The results of this study suggest that a high level of EI was typical among critical care unit nurses, nurses in intensive care units, neonatal intensive care units, then general nurses, and finally, nurses working in respiratory therapy with the lowest levels. The study showed moderate relations between EI and JP, and the latter could be affected by how some nurses perceive their emotions. This study's findings differ from other recent reports in the literature on this topic, strongly indicating an immediate need for further research to explain these contradictions and better model the phenomena in question, for instance. While Birks et al found similar results concerning levels of EI among various healthcare providers, the present study reported the highest average level of EI among critical care unit nurses. This suggests that high EI may be a prerequisite for finding work in nursing, and that it may exist in many candidates prior to recruitment. In previous major studies, this impression was reinforced during interviews with participants. 9, 40, 41 The nature of the nursing profession is that it requires practitioners to be both curing and caring, especially during vulnerable periods or end-of-life care. This aspect of the work very likely amplifies the effects of EI on nurses' performance. Gradually, this reliance on EI may increase their awareness of their own EI-related behaviors, allowing them to actively take part in ensuring the delivery of high-quality interdisciplinary care. 10, 42 More specifically, nurses' effective interactions with patients during end-of-life care could consistently maintain a healing environment in the hospital. Medical staff can pursue their own needs, desires, and aspirations in conjunction with their patients' health improvement and success. Hospital staff, particularly nurses, reflect innately skilled communication of empathy.",

The present results attempt to induce basic conclusions regarding the sources and attainment of empathy or other components of EI, or at least how EI is affected by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The current results are, however, consistent with those of Nightingale et al, who reported that high EI in nurses was associated with both corporeal and emotional caring; administrators and doctors may share such essence of EI, even if they have lower levels of EI. 2 Strangely, the lowest average level of EI was found among professionals in the allied medical sciences and who support ventilation services, where there is limited opportunity for direct communication with patients. 43, 44 The interpretation of a minor decrease in performance while having a slightly high EI is attributed to the nature of the catastrophe of COVID-19, where many patients are almost at the edge of death. Indeed, exhibiting the skills required to cope with change and respond accordingly to patients' needs is the ultimate goal of the nursing profession. Perhaps coping with clinical situations and enforcing tasks in helpful manners may increase EI, but still, there is a point where nurses can no longer adhere to their emotions. 45 The evidence-based studies about this pandemic are still in early stages, so we may confront more interpretations regarding the constructs that may emotionally play a vital role in JP.",
