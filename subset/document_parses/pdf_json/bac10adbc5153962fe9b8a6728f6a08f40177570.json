The turnaround time (TaT) from sample receipt to return of results is important to clinicians and their patients but was not monitored. Furthermore, we anticipated an imminent increase in demand from a forthcoming pathology service merger, together with long-term increases with the rise of personalised genetic medicine. In this quality improvement project, we identified current TaT performance and sources of delay. Over three plando-study-act (PDSA) cycles, we tested three change ideas, two involving using IT to remove manual administrative steps and alert us to samples needing progressing; both were retained. The other change involved separating out the targeted tests; we judged this not worthwhile with current demand levels, although something to be reexamined when volumes increase. During the project, we reduced mean TaT from 3.8 to 3.3 days and increased the proportion within our 5-day target from 78% to 100%. These have been sustained (at 3.4 days and 97%) for the 3 months following our PDSA cycles and illustrate that reducing variation can be as impactful as reducing the mean. We conducted this project during the COVID-19 disruption, which reduced demand substantially. We took advantage of this to allow staff to spend time on these improvement activities. Another interesting feature of the work is that during the project, we compared changes in performance on our targeted B27/B57 tests with that on another comparable test as a control, to consider the impact of the general increased attention (the Hawthorne effect). We found that performance on this control also increased comparably, but then fell away after our project finished, while it did not for B27/B57.",

These tests aid disease diagnosis and avoid patient hypersensitivity reactions in response to certain drugs. The lab provides a service for testing a wide range of HLA genes.

Much of this was possible as these pathways use a laboratory information management system (LIMS), which we manage locally. However, the B27/ B57 gene tests use the WinPath LIMS, which is managed on a pathology-wide basis, so these tests did not benefit from the same improvement efforts. The two drivers for the timing of this QI work were: (i) the realisation that for these tests we had not been monitoring the turnaround time (TaT, from receipt at CTL reception to completion (authorisation of the results on the LIMS)). We decided 5 days was a suitable TaT target (see 'Design' section), but were unsure whether we were achieving this or not-staff believed that often we were not; and (ii) we anticipated a ~10% rise in B27/B57 test sample numbers in the coming year following the pathology merger between BHNT, Homerton University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust and Lewisham and Greenwich NHS Trust to form the East and South East London NHS Pathology Partnership. 1 As there will be no additional funding with the sample number rise, we will need to absorb this extra demand into existing workflow.",

This vision is expressed in the WeCare values of being Welcoming, Engaging, Collaborative, Accountable, Respectful and Equitable. At CTL, we are accountable to clinicians who use our service and, ultimately, to their patients. With this in mind, we believed we could improve our B27/B57 test TaT using the BHNT QI approach (WeImprove), which is underpinned by the model for improvement and its plan-dostudy-act (PDSA) cycles. 4 5 This approach uses the model for improvements three systems thinking questions to gain an understanding of the system: \"What are we trying to accomplish?\" \"How will we know the change is an improvement?\" and \"What changes can we make that will result in the improvements that we seek?\" 6 Once ideas have been generated, they are tested via successive PDSA cycles in a disciplined way, learning from the successes and failures in each cycle. The benefits of this method is that is it simple, uses an easy-to-understand systematic approach and has been shown to be highly effective in healthcare settings. 4 It is suited to systems which generate easily available, fast-feedback and quantifiable data in an ongoing manner-such as TaTs.",

            "text": "HLAs are proteins on the surface of cells which are crucial for normal immune function. These are a diverse set of proteins with nearly 29 000 HLA alleles identified as of December 2020. 7 Certain HLA alleles have been shown to be associated with specific diseases (such as HLA-B*27 with AS, HLA-C*06 with psoriasis and HLA-B*51 with Beh\u00e7et's disease). 8 AS is part of a heterogenous group of conditions with overlapping clinical manifestations known as seronegative spondyloarthopathies. It is a chronic, progressive inflammatory arthropathy which presents as severe back pain and spinal stiffness. 9 There is often a significant delay in the diagnosis of AS, due to the diverse presentation of often generic symptoms such as back pain, along with the lack of a specific laboratory diagnostic test for the condition. 9 The time to diagnosis can be lengthy, as long as 7-10 years, 10 11 which is associated with poor treatment responses and worse outcomes. 12 As there is no single diagnostic laboratory test for AS, a diagnosis is arrived at through specialist assessment of clinical features. 9 Presence of the B27 gene has long been known to be significantly associated with AS, with a diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of 90%. 13 The current guidelines for diagnosis of AS state that presence of the B27 gene along with two other spondylarthritis features (such as inflammatory back pain, uveitis, psoriasis, enthesitis, etc) is highly suggestive of AS and should be confirmed with an MRI. 14 Therefore, testing for B27 as early as possible can guide clinicians to a more precise evaluation, contributing to earlier diagnosis and so to better patient outcomes. 10 HLA alleles are also associated with 'type B' adverse drug reactions (ADRs): allergic reactions to certain drugs related to host pharmacogenetic factors (rather than drug dose or pharmacology). 15 Examples of ADRs include drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome in response to abacavir, and Stevens-Johnson syndrome in response to carbamazepine. 15 ADRs cause significant morbidity and mortality and so an understanding of the immune mechanisms which drive the pathogenesis is highly desirable. Abacavir is a nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor with activity against the HIV. 16 It is part of one of the initial regimens recommended for most patients with HIV, as these regimens have demonstrated durable virological efficacy, good tolerability/toxicity profiles and ease of use. 17 However, ~5% of patients develop a hypersensitivity reaction to abacavir, presenting as a combination of fever, rash, gastrointestinal and respiratory symptoms which become more severe with continuation of the treatment. 18 In 2002, this reaction was shown to be associated with the presence of the HLA-B*57:01 allele, which has a prevalence of ~4% in the UK population. [19] [20] [21] As a result, the current standard of care is to ensure that a patient is negative for the B*57:01 gene before starting a course of abacavir. 17 The key performance indicator (KPI) for our CTL service is TaT, which has long been a marker of laboratory quality; an unsatisfactory TaT can be a major source of complaints about laboratories. 22 Laboratories have a responsibility to patients to produce reliable and precise results within a target TaT so that clinicians can make treatment decisions: lab staff have to balance timeliness and precision. The link between short TaTs and other measures such as length of hospital stay is well documented in the rapid laboratory disciplines such as haematology and biochemistry 22 and has also been the subject of much recent discussion during the COVID-19 pandemic, where rapid TaT of COVID-19 tests has been shown to be crucial in tracking, tracing and containing the spread of the infection. 23 Timely return of results in other areas, such as genetic-based testing, is becoming more important with advances in precision medicine. Personalised therapies based on genetics are a key part of healthcare strategies such as the NHS Long Term Plan. 24 ",

A PubMed search using search terms \"quality improvement\" with \"HLA\" or \"Histocompatibility\" or \"Immunogenetics\" only returns one relevant result: a QI project undertaken by the UCLA Immunogenetics Centre on improving electronic reporting of HLA antibody testing results. 25 To the best of our knowledge, there is no previous published QI work on HLA genetic testing. Figure 1 shows the workflow and our metrics. Our KPIs were the twin metrics of mean TaT (KP1) and % within our TaT target of 5 days (KP2). As noted, we expect demand to increase in future, but COVID-19 disruption caused a major reduction as many outpatient and GP appointments were cancelled or moved online during the pandemic. We monitored demand as a balancing metric (BM). During the project, we also introduced two (internal) process metrics (PM) for monitoring change impact (PM1 to monitor the percentage of tests that were included on the next available Luminex run, and PM2 to monitor test to authorisation time), plus an individual test sample progress monitoring measure (time in process so far (TiP), so we could identify samples at risk of breaching the target).",

Through this QI project, the TaT dropped further, reaching a mean TaT of 3.2 days with PDSA2.

The mean TaT (KP1, figure 2 ) for the post-PDSAs period is 3.4 days, and (the above events aside) it is 'capable' of reliably meeting the 5-day target since the upper of the red three sigma process variation limits does not exceed the target.

A parallel pressure is the need for earlier availability of results to enable clinicians to make earlier treatment decisions and so increase benefit to patients.",

We were pleased to fairly quickly achieve our aim of achieving at least 90% of samples being reported within 5 days of receipt, establish that this change was sustainable and start monthly monitoring of TaTs. We hope this project will demonstrate the potential to other H&I laboratories; further work is underway to disseminate this QI project both within the Trust and to H&I laboratories nationwide.",
