The World Health Organization provides evidence-based guidelines for a package of interventions for preventing, diagnosing, and treating common OIs, including tuberculosis (TB), cryptococcal meningitis, and severe bacterial infections. PEPFAR facilitates implementation of these guidelines. To identify PLHIV with low CD4, PEPFAR plans to support expanded access to CD4 testing, including a point-of-care assay that differentiates CD4 cell count as a binary of greater than or less than 200 cells/\u00b5L. To prevent AHD-related mortality, PEPFAR supports rapid ART initiation with integrase inhibitor-based regimens and implementation and documentation of TB preventive treatment. To diagnose selected OIs, PEPFAR is implementing urine lateral flow lipoarabinomannan use to identify TB among PLHIV who have a CD4 cell count < 200 cells/\u00b5L. To treat selected OIs, PEPFAR has focused on improving patient-centered care in TB/HIV co-infection services and scaling up implementation of new drug regimens for cryptococcal meningitis. To better understand mortality, PEPFAR has introduced an indicator, TX_ML, to routinely and systematically categorize outcomes, including deaths, among PLHIV on ART.",

Additionally, TB remained undiagnosed at death in 45.8% (95% CI 32.6-59.1%) of TB cases [15] . PLHIV may have limited symptoms of pulmonary TB or unrecognized extrapulmonary TB. Furthermore, because TB incidence among PLHIV on ART remains up to six times higher than among those not infected with HIV, adjunctive strategies to reduce TB-related mortality are critical.

In PEPFAR-supported country programs, when the policy for ART initiation criteria shifted from CD4 cell count thresholds to treatment for all, routine CD4 testing was de-emphasized to use resources to scale up viral load testing. Currently, PEPFAR supports limited CD4 testing among targeted groups receiving AHD services in HIV service delivery facilities, among PLHIV at presentation in areas with high AHD prevalence, or among individuals aged \u2265 5 years who have documented viremia despite receiving ART for more than a year [1, 12] . The challenge with this current approach is that persons who are not initially identified by clinical staging may never be identified as having AHD, and thus would miss AHD services. An inexpensive, reliable, point-of-care (POC) assay that allows identification of AHD would help tailor care for PLHIV with AHD.",

To address these limitations, in October 2018 PEPFAR introduced a new indicator, TX_ML, defined as the number of PLHIV on ART with no clinical contact after 28 days since their last expected contact, in its data reporting systems focused on loss to follow-up (LTFU), including LTFU from mortality, among all PLHIV on ART supported by PEPFAR [41, 42] .",

PEPFAR guidance encourages developing or strengthening national CRVS systems, which can then be used to track other diseasespecific mortality or to assess the impact of public health interventions. Additionally, this focus on mortality as an outcome is a key component of strengthening HIV casebased surveillance, a cornerstone of sustainable HIV programs.

Comprehensively addressing HIV-related mortality incorporates identifying and treating PLHIV with AHD; preventing, diagnosing, and treating OIs; tracing PLHIV lost from care; and improving mortality surveillance. These efforts include expanding access to integrase inhibitor-based ART regimens, diagnostics distinguishing between PLHIV with low CD4 and higher CD4 cell counts, and differentiated, intensified care for PLHIV with AHD.

Though research to date is not definitive, PLHIV may suffer a higher rate of severe disease from COVID itself [43, 44] and, perhaps more importantly, from discontinuity of HIV and co-morbidity care while health services are limited or shifted to COVID response. PEPFAR is working to adapt its service delivery models to both mitigate risk of COVID transmission among PLHIV and to maintain continuity of HIV care; these adaptations include an acceleration in multi-month dispensing to minimize need for clinic visits, development of true community care models, and changes in clinic flow and use of space to minimize risk to PLHIV in facilities. In this way, PEP-FAR and other global HIV programmers can continue to reduce mortality among PLHIV.",
