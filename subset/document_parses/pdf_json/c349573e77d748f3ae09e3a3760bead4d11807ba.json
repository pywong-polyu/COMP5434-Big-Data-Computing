The interpretation of serological findings mostly requires additional anamnestic and clinical information as well as the bacteriological or virological examination of samples. Serum titres alone do not prove the causative involvement of a pathogen in a clinical disease problem, as they can be induced by maternally derived antibodies, after recovery from respiratory disease or by endemic latent disease. In general, costs of serological testings are often minimized by examining only a reduced number of animals with the consequence that the information gained in the findings is of limited value. Accurate calculation of an adequate sample size to detect an infected herd (identification of at least one positive reagent) resulted in approximately 30 serum samples per animal group (300-3000 pigs) assuming a prevalence of 10% seropositive reagents (Gro\u00dfe Beilage, 2000) .
