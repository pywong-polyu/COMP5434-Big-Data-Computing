            "text": "In this paper, we collect and study Twitter communications to understand the societal impact of COVID-19 in the United States during the early days of the pandemic. With infections soaring rapidly, users took to Twitter asking people to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded closure of schools, bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. We methodically collect tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related hashtags. We first manually group the hashtags into six main categories, namely, 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying, 4) School Closures, 5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope, and study the temporal evolution of tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to all hashtag groups and specific to each hashtag group and identify the chief concerns of people as the pandemic gripped the nation (e.g., exploring bidets as an alternative to toilet paper). We conduct sentiment analysis and our investigation reveals that people reacted positively to school closures and negatively to the lack of availability of essential goods due to panic buying. We adopt a state-of-the-art semantic role labeling approach to identify the action words (e.g., fear, test), which capture the actions people are referring to in the tweets. We then leverage a LSTM-based dependency parsing model to analyze the context of the abovementioned action words (e.g., verb deal is accompanied by nouns such as anxiety, stress, and crisis). Finally, we develop a scalable seeded topic modeling approach to automatically categorize and isolate tweets into hashtag groups and experimentally validate that our topic model provides a grouping similar to our manual grouping. Our study presents a systematic way to construct an aggregated picture of peoples' response to the pandemic and lays the groundwork for future fine-grained linguistic and behavioral analysis.",

At the time of writing this paper, COVID-19 is still rapidly spreading around the world and projections for the next few months are grim and extremely disconcerting.

We observe that the total number of tweets as grouped by hashtags is 664,476, which is higher than the total number of tweets. This is because tweets can contain multiple hashtags and thus the same tweet can be grouped into multiple categories. We present some example tweets in Table III to illustrate the types of communications occurring on Twitter during this period.

Additionally, due to the rapidly evolving situation, it is likely that we have inadvertently missed some important hashtags, despite our best efforts. As is the case with most studies based on Twitter data, we also acknowledge the presence of bias in data collection [1] . Having said that, the goal of this study is to provide a panoramic summarized view of the impact of the pandemic on people's lives and aggregate public opinion as expressed by them.

We explore the word-usage (i.e, unigram and bigram) frequencies for each hashtag group to understand the main points of discussion. We then conduct a sentiment analysis to understand the prevailing sentiments in the tweets. We adopt a semantic role labeling approach to identify the action words (i.e., verbs) as well as the corresponding contextual analysis of these action words. Finally, we develop a scalable seeded LDA based topic model to automatically group tweets and validate its effectiveness with our manual grouping. Figure 1a shows the top 20 hashtags observed in our data. As expected, we see that hashtags corresponding directly to COVID or coronavirus are the most popular hashtags as most communications are centered around them. We observe that hashtags around social isolation, staying at home, and quarantining are also popular. Figure 1b shows the most popular hashtags by date. Similar to Figure 1a , we observe that hashtags related directly to COVID and social distancing trend most on Twitter. The figures and the number of tweets highlight how the pandemic gripped the United States with its rate of spread.",

We also remove the names of places and governors such as New York, Massachusetts and Andrew Cuomo. After filtering out these words, we then rank the words based on their occurrence in multiple groups and their combined frequency across all the groups. We observe words such as family, health, death, life, work, help, thank, need, time, love, crisis. In Table IV , we present some notable example tweets containing the common words. While one may think that health refers to the virusrelated health issues, we notice that many people also refer to mental health in their tweets as a possible consequence to social distancing and anxiety caused by the virus. We also observe the usage of words such as death and crisis to indicate the seriousness of the situation.

In the dependency parse, the action words/verbs form the root of the parse and the dependencies are in the left and right subtrees. To identify the nouns associated with the verbs, we traverse the dependency parse to the sub-tree where the action word of interest is present and then extract the corresponding noun. We also analyze the link associated with noun and verb and find that \"nsubj\" (Nominal Subject), \"pobj\" (Object of a preposition) and \"dobj\" (The Direct Object) are the most related link tags that contribute to the action words.

Apart from the verb-noun combinations that we expect to see in the group (such as test virus, confirm case, offer support), the other most notable verb-noun combinations in this group are: deal stress, deal anxiety, fear system, and fear safety. And in other groups, the verb-noun combinations narrow down on the specific actions relevant to the group. For instance, in School Closures, the action word close mostly talks about closing the schools for benefit of students, and action word offer co-occurs with teaching aids through online sources. In the Panic Buying group, tweets about the panic experienced by people is captured by verb-noun pairs such as stop madness, buy paper, find store. In the Lockdown group, some interesting combinations surface such as believe information, guess trust, which captures the possible distrust people have with the lockdown measures.

The seed words need not be exhaustive as the model is able to detect other words in the same category via co-occurrence in the dataset. Our goal with seeded LDA is to i) present a way to automatically categorize tweets into specific topics of interest, especially when the topics are rarer in the dataset, ii) passively evaluate the effectiveness of our word analysis thus far, and iii) develop a scalable approach that can be extended to millions of tweets with minimal manual intervention.",

We leave out the Frustration and Hope topic due to the inherent polarizing nature of the keywords and the lack of identifying keywords that are unique for the topic. We select the top few words from our words in Figure 3 as seed words for our Seeded LDA model. Table X gives the seed words for the different COVID categories. We include k unseeded topics in our model to account for messages that do not fall into these topic categories. After experimenting with different values of k and manually evaluating the topics, we find that k = 2 gives us the best separation and categorization. We use \u03b1 = 0.01 and \u03b2 = 0.0001 to give us sparse documenttopic and topic-word distributions where fewer topics and words with high values emerge, so we can classify the tweets to the predominant category. We train the seeded LDA models for 2000 iterations. We first use the documenttopic distribution to get the best topic for each tweet. If the best topic of the message is one of the seeded topics which correspond to the categories, then, we classify the tweet into that category. In the event that a clear best topic does not emerge, we randomly assign the tweet to one of the topics that have the same document topic distribution. 1) Analyzing Effectiveness of Seeded LDA Model: To check how closely the hashtag groups match with the seeded LDA groups, we measure the accuracy by comparing the document topic distribution from the LDA against the grouping determined by the hashtags. We do this by calculating the confusion matrix which gives us four metrics such as true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives to further calculate accuracy, precision, recall, and f1 scores, which gives the value of correctness. The results we obtained are shown in the Table XI . This endeavor helps in determining the effectiveness of our word analysis (seeds) and our seeded LDA model. Also, to verify that our model had best results in the groups that we are interested in, we calculate the precision, recall, and F1 scores for the School Closures, Panic Buying, Lockdowns, and Quarantine groups. We exclude General COVID and Frustration and Hope groups as they are too general, and we are interested in isolating the more specific COVID groups. Table XII shows the results of each group.",

As the disease continued to spread, we observed panic buying as well as calls for closures of schools, bars, cities, social distancing and quarantining. We conducted a linguistic word-usage analysis and identified the most frequently occurring unigrams and bigrams in each group that provide us an idea of the main discussion points. We conducted sentiment analysis to understand the extent of positive and negative sentiments in the tweets. We then performed semantic role labeling to identify the key action words and then obtained the corresponding contextual words using dependency parsing. Finally, we designed a scalable seeded topic modeling approach to automatically identify the key topics in the tweets.",
