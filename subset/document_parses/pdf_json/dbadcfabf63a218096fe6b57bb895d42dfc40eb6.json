As pro-inflammatory patterns and cytokine storm are among the hallmarks of severe COVID-19 pneumonia, early low dose of corticosteroids (CTC) has been proved to be effective in the RECOVERY trial [1] and subsequent meta-analysis [2]. However, a large proportion of patients remained dependent of mechanical ventilation at the end of the CTC therapy, and questions about late administration and possibly high doses of CTC to prevent or treat lung fibrosis in persistent ARDS [3] are unresolved. We, therefore, aimed to evaluate the impact of late CTC for COVID-19 ARDS patients versus the absence of CTC administration.",

We studied patients who did not receive (no CTC group) or received CTC later than 13 days after symptoms onset (75% percentile of patients included in the RECOV-ERY trial [1]) (CTC group). We analyzed the effect of CTC administration on ICU 90-day survival with a Cox model by specifying the delay between intubation and administration of CTC as a time-dependent covariate. Potential confounding factors (age, gender, body mass index, hypertension, prone position, venovenous extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO), comorbidities, static compliance and PaO 2 /FiO 2 at intubation) were tested for inclusion in the final model. The same strategy was used to study the effect of CTC on mechanical ventilation duration, after censoring for death.
