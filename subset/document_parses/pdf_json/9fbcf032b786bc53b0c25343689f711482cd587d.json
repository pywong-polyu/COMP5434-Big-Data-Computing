There are various forms of seasonal influenza and it spreads easily and rapidly in communities throughout the world. The virus is able to assume epidemic proportion in a short time frame. 1 In temperate climates, seasonal epidemics occur primarily during the winter, but in tropical regions, influenza may occur throughout the year, something that causes irregular and hard to predict outbreaks. 2, 3 Surveillance systems for influenza often rely on hospital-based clinical data to monitor the virus' activities and allow public health officials to take necessary actions. 4 Different surveillance systems may have different criteria and reporting eligibilities. The determination of data included in this report is determined by the surveillance system. The assessment of case eligibility for reporting requires data from multiple sources including physical examination, collection of signs and symptoms, and laboratory results.",

The lifecycle begins with initial exposure and then progresses to incubation, symptoms, a visit to a healthcare facility, and confirmation of diagnosis. There are various surveillance systems that can be used at different phases of the disease lifecycle. Each system has its own strengths and weaknesses that can be identified based on the data being collected. 5 Generally, systems can be in one or two categories: data collected before visiting a healthcare facility and data collected after visiting a healthcare facility. Syndromic surveillance methods involve \"relying on detection of clinical case features that are discernible before confirmed diagnoses are made\". 5 This type of system often uses data prior to confirmation of diagnosis. It is an early stage of detection that uses information to estimate the probability of a case or outbreak and then may ask for a further public health response. This information occurs prior to diagnosis, something which often requires laboratory results to be obtained.",

Although this type of system can improve the accuracy of the reported data by allowing physicians to assess the case and confirm the diagnosis, it has the disadvantage of longer reporting time as well as the possibility of missing false-negative cases. [6] [7] [8] [9] This system could result in longer outbreak detection time since there are additional steps needed prior to the data being entered into the reporting system. The time taken for analysis at the central registry and the time needed for the public health registry to communicate the findings with the applicable hospital-(s) authority and treating physician(s) and the issuing of a warning signal can be somewhat substantial. [10] [11] [12] Another limitation of the system is that some physicians may miss cases. This issue is more probably with Influenza Like Illness (ILI) as it shares similar signs and symptoms with other diseases, especially during the early stages of the infection. Confirmation is typically obtained through laboratory testing. 9 Physician awareness of an outbreak in an area will increase the likelihood of ordering laboratory resting and engaging in a more thorough investigation. Early warning signs of unusual influenza activity in an area can direct physician attention toward a potential outbreak and greater investigation. This added attention can ultimately lead to a proper diagnosis of the epidemic and the triggering of necessary public health actions.",

In a study that assessed the sensitivity of search data on Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia, there was low to medium sensitivity in influenza event detection. The study concluded that the search data had a limited ability to contribute to surveillance systems designed to detect influenza. 16 Similarly, cross-correlation analysis in our study showed a weak correlation. [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] Influenza patterns in tropical regions do not always follow seasonal patterns and there is high background influenza activity throughout the year. 31 Despite its benefits, Google Trends is prone to bias and can provide inaccurate signals. 10, 14, 32 For example, peaks could be overestimated when users search of postinfluenza-related keywords based on media coverage. In these cases, individuals who do not suffer from influenzarelated symptoms would impact the results. 20 According to Cervellin et al., Google's Trends is more influenced by media coverage than the actual epidemiological burden. 33 The spike in the use of the search term \"MERS\" during 2014 (Figure 1 ) was the result of high public anxiety due to media coverage and was not an accurate reflection of the cases during this time. 34",

In our study, the number of cases generated by Google Trends at a city or regional level was low and made inferences difficult. We used the country-level Google Trend for this reason. The extent to which Google Trend search terms represent a particular geographic region should be taken into account. This is especially important when a country or state has areas with different environmental factors, in particular humidity and temperature. 3 The data collection area could have caused some cities and areas with higher populations to be overrepresented. Google Trends data for the study's hospital is available in smaller quantities, a factor that makes it somewhat difficult to use.",

Although the two trends had some similarities during the peak influenza season, the overall correlation was statistically weak. In general, influenza cases in hot and humid areas have less defined seasonality compared to non-tropical areas. Given the strong association between weather and influenza. We found it very important to examine the accuracy of Google Trends of influenza under the different regions with different climates and the degree to which regional climates can impact the accuracy of Google Trends. Further studies could also examine the alternative sources of influenza data derived from search terms and social media. The author also recommends examining ILI compared to pandemic influenza as the search term for \"pandemic influenza\" may be more a product of media coverage than the actual virus. ",
