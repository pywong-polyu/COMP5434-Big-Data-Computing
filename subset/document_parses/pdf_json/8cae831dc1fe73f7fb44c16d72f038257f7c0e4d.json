Using per capita carbon dioxide emissions (CPC) as the proxy for air pollution, and macro-non-financial governance (MNFG) and macro-financial governance (MFG) as the proxies for MEG, the study introduces the systemic and fragmented governance of green complementarities (GCMs) and dirty complementarities (DCMs) as analytic concepts to compare the MEG models for managing pollution in 13 high-income countries (HICs), 10 upper-middle-income countries (UMICs), and nine lower-middle-income countries (LMICs) for the period 1994-2014. The paper concludes that (i) HICs reduced their CPC levels thanks to adopting green systemic governance by creating GCMs between both MNFG and MFG variables in the long run; (ii) UMICs experienced a remarkable increase in their CPC levels due to adopting dirty systemic governance by creating DCMs between the MNFG variables, but prevented pollution from being higher through creating GCMs between the MFG variables; and (iii) LMICs experienced the highest comparative increase in CPC due to adopting a fragmented governance in managing both MNFG-pollution and MFG-pollution nexus.",

Of the major types of environmental pollution, air pollution 1 is the most significant environmental health risk, causing the death of more than seven million people annually (WHO, 2021; Burney & Ramanathan, 2014; Dockery et al., 1993; Second, the paper introduces two modes of economic governance in managing macroeconomy-pollution nexus, systemic and fragmented governance. Third, the paper introduces green and dirty complementarities to explain the effects of macroeconomic variables on pollution under systemic and fragmented modes of macroeconomic governance. Fourth, the paper focuses on long-run (cointegrated) relationships between macroeconomic governance and takes carbon dioxide emissions, CO 2 , as the proxy for air pollution given that CO 2 is a stock pollutant whose effect lasts more than one century. Fifth, the paper sets up two models that measure the impact of major financial and non-financial macroeconomic aggregates on pollution by (i) using Pedroni and Kao panel cointegration tests and panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) technique executed by pooled mean group estimator (Pesaran & Smith, 1995; Pesaran et al., 1999) , and (ii) by taking 13 high-income, 10 uppermiddle-income, and 9 lower-middle-income countries for the period 1994-2014 based on the availability of statistically consistent set of data for all twelve variables included in the analysis.",

In their seminal study, Grossman and Krueger (1991) provided an empirical test of EKC hypotheses. Thereafter, several studies, such as Dinda and Coondoo (2006) , Managi and Jena (2008) , Stern (2004) , and Shafik (1994) , carried out their investigation on linear and nonlinear relationships between economic activity and emissions. However, the EKC hypothesis exclusively tests the aggregate growth-pollution nexus, but does not explain how each component of growth affects pollution in time or if their effects diverge from each other, which may restrain the specification of variablespecific policy options.",

In fact, there may be a general perception of the MEG-pollution nexus. Economic development, growth, energy consumption, and trade openness may increase pollution faster in LMICs and UMICs than in HICs in both the short and long run (Dong et al., 2020a; Ehigiamusoe, 2019; Wu et al., 2018) . Because the developing world uses energy-intensive production technologies based on fossil fuels-predominantly nonrenewable energy sources (Dong et al., 2019 (Dong et al., , 2020b Hu et al., 2018;  Ehigiamuoe & Lean, 2019)-developed countries generally have illiberal trade models based on the export of dirty commodities (Fakher, 2018; Lv & Xu, 2019) . Furthermore, developing countries typically do not have green or strict regulations on FDI; neither do they have nation-wide standardized regulations on environmental quality (Danlami et al., 2019; Song, Li, et al., 2021; L. Zhang et al., 2021) nor effective, democratic, and nation-wide standardized mechanisms of environmental governance . Likewise, public awareness of environmental degradation tends to be low (Mujtaba et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021) . CPC levels in our case countries of three income groups support, prima facie, this general perception. As Fig. 1 illustrates, in the period 1994-2014, CPC declined by 0.8 percent in HICs and increased on average by 2.1 percent and 2.9 percent in UMICs and LMICs, respectively. However, as noted above, the findings on the macroeconomy-pollution nexus for each country group are so ambiguous that they are hardly able to produce a clear-cut group-specific relationship pattern for HICs, UMICs, and LMICs; this is because the perception of the nexus is based on an estimation using not a systematic but rather a fragmented set of macroeconomic variables.",

This is significant because pollution-income or pollution-growth nexus is dependent on the pollution-macroeconomy nexus. It is the mode of macroeconomic governance, as detailed below, that determines the rate of growth or the level of income in a country. Accordingly, we do not make an EKC-based analysis, because we suggest that greening economic systems in a full-fledged manner requires the greening of overall macroeconomic structure with its financial and non-financial dynamics (Heijdra & Heijnen, 2013) . Such an approach entails disaggregating the macroeconomy-pollution nexus by bringing all these individual variables into the analysis simultaneously rather than investigating the aggregate growth-pollution nexus itself. On this basis, second, we cluster the major macroeconomic variables into two groups and then set up our econometric models to test the effects of the macroeconomic variables in each group on pollution in terms of both their individual and complementary effects. This is necessary both for structuring the effects of major macroeconomic variables on air pollution to remove the potential shortcomings of the ambiguous findings and for coming up with structured policy suggestions not only for the relationships between each macroeconomic variable and pollution but also for the overall macroeconomy-pollution nexus.",

Economic governance can be defined, in broad strokes, as a patterned or unpatterned system of interaction between public or private actors for adjusting or monitoring one or more market structures under the guidance of predetermined rules and procedures. In specific, macroeconomic governance is the collective ordering of micro-macro policy choices in deploying financial and non-financial institutions, underlying public-private and national-international economic relations.Macroeconomic governance can basically be financial and non-financial based on the functional clustering of major macroeconomic variables. An economic system relies mainly on two functions. The first is the real economic activity consisting of production, consumption, trade, and foreign direct investment. The second is the financial flows that fund these activities at public and private sectors. Macro-non-financial governance is a policy mix that consists of the propensity of (a) governments to adjust the size of their purchases; (b) non-financial sector to adjust the size of fixed capital investment; (c) nonfinancial businesses to adjust the size of imports or exports; and (d) foreign direct investors to adjust the size of their investments across countries. In a similar vein, macro-financial governance represents a policy mix that consists of (a) the adjustment of the size of government debt for financing public purchases; (b) the adjustment of gross savings (to buy financial assets such as debt securities, corporate equities, and mutual fund shares, or the depositing of money as time and savings deposits); (c) the adaptation of an accommodative or non-accommodative monetary policy mainly by changing the quantity of (broad) Fig. 1 Per capita carbon emissions in HICs, UMICs, and LMICs, 1994 .

We suggest that it is the same ordering that determines the impact of macroeconomic governance on ecological pollution including air pollution. This impact can be explained based on the complementary dynamics of macroeconomic aggregates. Complementarities can be defined as the mutual reinforcement among a certain group of variables in part or all of a social structure that improves or worsens clustering relative to alternative configurations (Hall & Soskice, 2001) . There would emerge four types of relationships between the components of macro-financial and macro-non-financial governance in affecting pollution: (i) a 'green' complementary relationship in reducing pollution, (ii) a 'dirty' complementary relationship in increasing pollution, (iii) the conflation of the first two options, which is more realistic, and (iv) the lack of any relationship. We sketch out the first two cases. The delineation of the last two options is a matter of empirical analysis.",

The greater energy efficiency and the lower cost of green production may enable firms to invest more funds in cleaner capital goods and technologies, thus becoming more internationally competitive in green products. Accruing higher revenue from green goods may stimulate governments to maintain their policy perspective. At the same time, greater savings may both reduce aggregate demand and augment financial development by increased investment in financial assets such as shares. Further financial market development can enable firms to have faster and easier access to cheaper and long-term funds, consolidating their ability to sustain their green production strategy for the predictable future. Monetary policy can complement this virtuous cycle by first providing necessary liquidity to financial markets and then achieving equilibrium in the quantity of money, respectively. Thus, green complementarities-GCMs-would emerge (i) between government consumption expenditures, private investment expenditures, and exports in the MNFG-pollution nexus, and (ii) between savings, financial market development, and monetary policy in the MFG-pollution nexus.",

In terms of the MFG-pollution nexus, the reduced savings may result from higher investment and consumption expenditures, leaving a lower level of investment in shares. The consequent slow or inadequate level of financial market development may stimulate firms to maintain their dirty production strategy, concentrating on short-run gains by using cheap natural resource-intensive energy instead of transitioning to long-run productivity and cost advantages as a result of energy efficiency. A contractionary monetary policy can worsen this vicious cycle by not supplying the necessary quantity of liquidity to financial markets and by worsening economic predictability as a result of failing to meet the demand for money. Consequently, there would emerge dirty complementarities (DCMs) (i) between government purchases, investment expenditures, and exports in the Table 1 Examples for pollution-reducing and pollution-increasing impacts of major macroeconomic aggregates Variable Pollution-reducing impact achieved by Pollution-increasing impact caused by Gross fixed capital investment Investment in less energy-intensive sectors, lower use of natural resources, and energy efficiency thanks to using cleaner technologies and production techniques (Sarkodie & Strezov, 2018) Energy-intensive production using higher quantity of factors of production (scale effect) or energy inefficient/environmentally unfriendly technologies (Bilan et al., 2019; Rahman & Ahmad, 2019) Government consumption expenditures Stimulus programs in or consuming clean and renewable energy, environmentally friendly public goods such as efficient public transportation and high-speed trains, and green buildings (Halkos & Paizanos, 2013; Ghalipour and Farzanegan, 2018) Higher quantity of government expenditures underlying higher emissions by stimulating higher fixed capital investment, creating a multiplier impact on investment and consumption expenditures (Dai et. al., 2012; Halkos & Paizanos, 2013; Galinato and Islam, 2014; Lopez and Palacios, 2014; Islam and Lopez, 2015) Exports and Imports Encouraging competition in producing clean products (Shahbaz et. al., 2013) ; an export-led strategy based mainly on raw materials and other agricultural products (Javid & Sharif, 2016; Zhang & Gangopadhyay, 2012) ; achieving energy-efficient production by importing clean capital goods and technologies (Javid & Sharif, 2016) Exporting natural resource-intensive goods or using dirty technologies in producing exports; importing pollution-intensive products or dirty technologies (Khalil & Inam, 2006; Nasir, 2019; Solarin, 2017; Hal\u0131c\u0131o\u011flu, 2009) Foreign Direct Investment Encouraging R&D in reducing emissions, using less energyintensive production techniques and green technologies, particularly in high-income countries (Demena & Afesorgbor, 2020; Marques & Caetano, 2020) Using outdated technologies, investing in most polluting industries or consuming arable lands (Nasir et al., 2019; Zhang, 2011; Xie et. al., 2020; Kivyiro & Arminen, 2014) Savings Reducing the rate of domestic aggregate demand or trade in goods and services (Hamilton & Clemens, 1999) ; Stimulating financialization and deindustrialization (Palley, 2013) Growth-oriented intermediation of savings by finance sector, in particular in developing countries (Aghion et al., 2016) , when growth rests upon energy-intensive techniques and consumption patterns (Islam and Lopez, 2015; Al-mulali & Sab, 2012; G\u00f6k, 2020) Contractionary economic policy curtailing critical public expenditures on or private investment in environmental protection, energy-efficient technologies, and environmental R&D; structural adjustment or austerity measures causing deforestation or excessive extraction and the use of underpriced natural resources for comparative cost advantage (Holden et al., 1998) Public debt Using public funds in applying tax cuts for or financially stimulating green technologies and products, supporting R&D in green technologies (Carrat\u00f9 et. al., 2019; Cetin and Bakirta\u015f, 2020) Funding expansionary government policies, in particular above a certain threshold, stimulating higher carbon emissions (Clootens, 2017); applying tax cuts for or financially stimulating dirty technologies or products; either not supplying or substantially reducing the funds for R&D in green technologies, discouraging the use of energy-efficient technologies",

Evidently, GCMs and DCMs or their conflation in a third case lead to an especially complex set of policy choices and outcomes (Warford et al., 1997: 48) . The key point of today under the rising threat of COVID-19 and imminent other pandemics is how to govern these choices and outcomes. We suggest two broad modes of governance, systemic governance, and fragmentation, which can be used to explain pollution-macroeconomy nexus in terms of the joint environmental impact of the cited choices and outcomes. Explaining their 'joint' impact in a 'multivariate' setting is significant as it is their joint, complementary or simultaneous rather than separate impact per se that determines the overall level of pollution (Apsimon et al., 2009; Warford et al., 1997: 65-80; Girma, 1992) .",

In empirical terms, we run a multivariate causality analysis taking MNFG and MFG variables together as independent variables in two separate models.

A trending relationship is an indication of an ordered mode of governance because it illustrates in macroeconomic terms that variables In our analysis, long run denotes a time period when the macroeconomic variables and CO 2 emissions comove in a patterned manner. The 'patterned' here denotes, for example, a relationship dominated by green or dirty complementarities (see Figs. 3, 4, and 5). Short run denotes the subperiods when this patterned relationship diverges from the long-run equilibrium of the patterned relationship.

The reason why we select CPC for pollution is that our primary focus is on the long-term relationships between the macroeconomy and pollution. Pollutants are twofold: flow and stock pollutants. Flow pollutants only have an immediate effect on the environment. The atmospheric lifetime of sulfur dioxide (SO 2 ), nitrogen oxide (NO x ), and carbon monoxide (CO) is 1-4 days, 2-5 days, and 1-3 months, respectively. But stock pollutants accumulate in the air, and their effects last a century or longer (Lieb, 2004; Liu & Liptak, 2000; Moore, 2009; Ukaogo et al., 2020) . Furthermore, a high correlation between SO 2 , NO x , and CO 2 demonstrates that CO 2 emissions matter for the short run as well (Angelopoulos Table 2 List of variables and their descriptions Annual data between 1994 and 2014 ( T=21) for three different income groups; *As percent of GDP; Source: World Bank (2020) Fischer & Heutel, 2013; Smulders, 2004) . In other words, the key analytical concern between stock and flow pollutants is that the former matter both for the long and short run, whereas the latter are relevant only for the short run. The fact that CO 2 data are consistently available for a large number of countries is another key reason for selecting it as a proxy for pollution. We developed two models, which can be written in the following formal algebraic forms. The first model estimates the long-run and short-run relationships between MNFG and pollution, whereas the second between MFG and pollution. The variables represented by the acronyms are defined in Table 2. where i = 1, 2, \u2026 N ; t = 1, 2, \u2026 T and e 1,it , and e 2,it are error terms.",

As all variables in the both models we established are I(1), we are able to run oanel ARDL for our models.

This result illustrates that HICs achieved a reduction in their CPC levels by adopting a systemic mode of macroeconomic governance in operating GCMs. We infer this 'green systemic governance' for the long run considering that the great majority of the variables of MEG converge in creating GCMs. That imports and inward foreign direct investment cause an increase in CPC does not change our result as both the majority and the key variables of macroeconomic variables converge in creating GCMs, which underlies the reduction in CPC levels in these countries in the long run. In the short run, only government expenditures out of MNFG variables have a positive effect on CPC. The remaining MNFG variables and all the MFG variables have no short-run relationship with CPC. Thus, there is an institutional fragmentation in governing the macroeconomy-pollution nexus for HICs in the short run, which may have hindered a faster and/or higher reduction in pollution levels in these countries. As Fig. 4 illustrates, an increase in the key variables of MNFG (fixed capital formation, government expenditures, and exports) causes an increase in CPC in the UMICs. Thus, we can conclude that there is a systemic mode of MNFG in increasing CPC levels in the UMICs-'dirty systemic governance.' This does not mean that the countries make an intentional effort to increase their CPC levels, but rather that the convergence of public-private investment policy and public consumption policy leads to this outcome. However, the key domestic variables of MFG (broad money, public debt, and savings) converge Fig. 3 The effects of MNFG's and MFG's variables on CPC in HICs in creating a green complementary effect. There are two relevant points in terms of the unified impact of the MNFG and MFG in the UMICs on CPC. First, the production, consumption, and trade variable of the MNFG model that have a direct impact on CPC may have underlay the increase in CPC in the UMICs. In contrast, that the MFG was executed in the form of green systemic governance can be suggested as an underlying factor that helps explain why the increase in pollution in UMICs was lower than that in LMICs. When it comes to the short run, only the foreign direct inflows out of the MNFG variables have a statistically significant positive impact on CPC, and only financial market development of the MFG variables has a statistically significant negative impact on CPC. We can thus safely conclude that there was a fragmented governance model in the examined UMICs in the short run, which may have factored into the remarkable increase in CPC in these countries.",

This conclusion lies in two facts. First, as Fig. 5 illustrates, there is no long-run cointegrated relationship between MNFG's variables and CPC, and there is no statistically significant relationship between MFG's major variables and CPC, too, except a negative effect running from portfolio investment to CPC. What may have consolidated this result is the lack of a statistically significant relationship between CPC and MFG's variables in the LMICs in the short run. Our study confirms a number of findings in the extant literature about the relationships between individual macroeconomic variables and pollution. For example, our findings for the HICs confirm that real economic activity in HICs reduces pollution (Chen & Taylor, 2020; Hamit-Haggar, 2012; Salari et al., 2021) . Specifically, our results confirm the negative effects running from FDI to CO 2 (Bulus & Koc, 2021) and from financial market development to CO 2 (Shoaib et al., 2020) , and the positive effect running from imports to CO 2 in HICs (Ali & Kirikkaleli, 2021) . Our empirical findings for UMICs confirm, in general, that real economic activity increases CO 2 emissions in these countries (Ahmed & Shimada, 2019; Bhat, 2018; Ummalla & Goyari, 2020) , in particular regarding the positive effect running from government expenditures to CO 2 (Carlsson & Lundstr\u00f6m, 2001; Fan et al., 2020) , from international trade to CO 2 (Wu et al., 2021a (Wu et al., , 2021b , and from investment expenditures to CO 2 (Nugraha & Osman, 2018; Shahbaz et al., 2020) . Our findings for LMICs also confirm, in general, that real economic activity increases CO 2 emissions in these countries (Antonakakis et al., 2017; Ben Jebli et al., 2020; Ehigiamusoe & Lean, 2019; Halkos & Gkampoura, 2021; Zaman & Moemen, 2017) , specifically confirming the positive effect running from imports to CO 2 (Alola & Joshua, 2020) and from FDI to CO 2 (Lau et al., 2018; Shi et al., 2020) .",

Instead, we first grouped countries based on their levels of income and then investigated the effects of macroeconomic variables on pollution in the selected countries. However, it turns out that a dynamic approach to the macroeconomy-pollution nexus using the EKC hypothesis would be a valuable exercise to understand the changing effects of macroeconomic governance on pollution for the same group of countries with changing levels of income. Evidently, such a dynamic approach would yield the formulation of stage-specific policy inferences for governing the relationship between each variable of macroeconomic governance and pollution.",

A key result of this way of action is that there has yet to be formulated common characteristics for macroeconomy-pollution nexus for HICs, UMICs, and LMICs. The paper contributed to the joint explanation of the effect of macroeconomic variables on pollution, thereby mitigating the ambiguity of the findings on various income groups.",

At national level, it becomes evident that HICs should attach specific and primary importance to their foreign (real) economic relations, because both imports and FDI in these countries increase CO 2 emissions, whereas the domestic (real) economic activity altogether reduces it. Specifically, HICs should prioritize greening financial market development as it is a significant variable in providing both public and private (real) economic actors with necessary funds for the said reorganization. The UMICs should reorganize the relationship between their entire domestic (real) economic activity and pollution rather than the relationships of only one of these variables (e.g., government expenditures, investment expenditures, and exports) with pollution. Apparently, any variablespecific policy option in reorganizing these relationships free from each other cannot be expected to create a green economic model in UMICs. Greening financial market development should also be achieved simultaneously with this reorganization as it will be impossible to achieve in the absence of the necessary financial funds. When it comes to LMICs, they need a system-wide reorganization both for domestic and for foreign real economic activities. In so doing, they may prioritize fixed capital formation, exports, and imports over government expenditures.",

A systemic mode of green macroeconomic governance may be used as a best practice or benchmark for international organizations to make a green world possible, as the fragmented, variable-specific or country-specific policy approach may not be sufficient to drive a worldwide transformation of the macroeconomy-pollution nexus. In this regard, international organizations, including the IMF, the World Bank, and the OECD, which either impose their structural adjustment programs or make policy recommendations to their member countries, should take concerted action in cooperation with organizations such as the United Nations, the European Environment Agency, and the Earth System Governance Project in greening macroeconomic regimes. The necessity of systemic or green approaches in dealing with the macroeconomy-pollution nexus becomes even more urgent during the pandemic and in the post-COVID-19 era. First, as noted earlier, air pollution exacerbates the deadly effects of COVID-19 (Pozzer et al., 2020) and the WHO makes recurrent warnings about the pandemic ahead (WHO, 2020). Second, there has already been a process of deglobalization and economic recession with rising protectionism, disruption of global supply chains, a sharp fall in international commercial and financial flows, an increasing shortage of raw materials and final products, sharp slumps in stock markets, a heightened volatility of financial asset prices, and finally, a rapid drop in (domestic and foreign) aggregate demand (WEF, 2020). Thus, short-run policy actions focusing exclusively on stimulating quantitative growth at all costs may make economic systems less sustainable in the long run by either disrupting the complementary effects of the majority of the MEG variables in HICs in reducing pollution or by deepening the pollution-increasing effects of the MNFG variables in UMICs or in LMICs. A long-run, focused fine-tuning of macroeconomic and environmental priorities may be possible only by handling these trade-offs from a systemic approach elaborated on in this paper.",

The first is to explain the weight and comparative significance of MNFG and MFG in the overall increase or decrease in CPC levels (not only by looking at coefficient values but also by comparing the joint impact of their respective variables). The second is to study how long-run and short-run modes of MEG can be organized so as to complement each other in creating GCMs. This is relevant in particular for (i) how the pollution-reducing effects of long-run and green systemic governance in the HICs can be complemented by the same mode of governance in the short run, and (ii) how the long-run and green systemic governance model for managing the MFG-pollution nexus in the UMICs can be extended to the MNFG-pollution nexus, and how it can be adapted in the short run both for the MNFG-pollution and for the MFG-pollution nexus. The third issue is to deepen the analysis by explaining the specific GCMs between the MEG variables in each country group or in individual countries; the models used in the paper investigated system-wide complementarities and did not illustrate the specific complementarities that create mutual reinforcement between the MEG variables in reducing or increasing pollution. Another area for further research is to determine if green systemic governance can work better when adapted by concerted action, possibly through the comparison of coordinated and liberal market economies. The sixth and final point is to study the existence and adaptability of systemic governance in an international context during a stage when there is an urgent need for a complementary action by national, regional, international, and global actors in tackling severe environmental challenges.",

Second, such a systematic approach yields to the formulation of system-wide policy proposals in a way that demonstrates, first, what to do to make an entire macroeconomic system environmentally friendly, then, how to decide on what to do first to achieve this objective, and finally how to restructure variable-specific policy options. Third, the green and dirty complementarities as analytic tools that mediate the clustering of the converging pollution-increasing or pollution-decreasing effects of macroeconomic variables on pollution underlie the systematization and structuring of both the theoretical analysis and empirical policy inferences. Fourth, it is the systemic and fragmented modes of governance that underlie the explanation of the macroeconomy-pollution nexus from a complementary-theoretic approach by presenting a framework through which the existence or absence of complementarities between macroeconomic variables and pollution can be contextualized into an ordered analytic perspective. Fifth, (i) the systemic and fragmented governance models of GCMs and DCMs are, inter alia, the key drivers of countries' CPC levels, and (ii) environmental pollution can be tackled effectively when adopting green systemic governance in managing the variables of MNFG and MFG both in the long run and in the short run for all country groups. Sixth, it turns out that the EKC hypothesis needs to be systematically disaggregated for the understanding of how each component of macroeconomic governance has a dynamic effect on pollution. This disaggregation is necessary both (i) for explaining if the EKC hypothesis holds for the relationship between each component of growth and pollution in the same direction and magnitude as that between aggregate growth and pollution itself, (ii) thereby coming up with variable-specific policy suggestions to illustrate when and how to green each macroeconomic variable.",

Pooled ordinary least squares (POLS) estimates Eqs. 1 and 2 for t critical values are tabulated by Levin et al. (2002) via Monte Carlo simulations for various combinations of N and T commonly employed in applied work. H 0 \u2236 = 0 and H 1 \u2236 < 0 are the null and the alternative hypothesis, respectively. Under the H 0 , there is a unit root, while under the H 1 alternative there is no unit root.While the Levin et al. (2002) test requires bias correction factors to correct for crosssectionally heterogeneous variances to ensure efficient POLS estimation, the Breitung (2001) test achieves the same result by appropriate variable transformations. , in Eqs. 10 and 11, is restricted to be identical across countries under both the null and alternative hypotheses is one of the drawbacks of the Levin et al. (2002) and Breitung (2001) tests. Im et al. (2003) , here after IPS, is proposed a t-bar test using the following model:It has the advantage over the Levin et al. (2002) and Breitung (2001) tests it does not assume that all countries converge toward the equilibrium value at the same speed under the alternative hypothesis and thus is less restrictive. The IPS test is the adjusted version of ADF individual unit root test statistics. As T and N goes to infinity, the IPS statistics is asymptotically normally distributed. The null and alternative hypothesis of IPS test:While H 0 assumes that each series in the panel has a unit root for all cross-sectional units, H 1 means stationary of panel series.The test statistic of IPS unit root test is modeled as follows:(1)",
