            "text": "Liver cirrhosis represents a type of end-stage liver disease with few effective therapies, which was characterized by damaged functional liver tissue due to long-term inflammation. Gasdermin D (GSDMD)-executed programmed necrosis is reported to be involved in inflammation. However, the role of GSDMD in liver cirrhosis remains unclear. In this study, we used a CCl 4 -induced cirrhosis model and found stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) infusion showed profound therapeutic effects for liver cirrhosis. Mechanistically, NLRP3 inflammasome-activated GSDMD and its pyroptosis were upregulated in liver cirrhosis, while SHED infusion could suppress the expression of GSDMD and Caspase-1, resulting in reduced hepatocyte pyroptosis and inflammatory cytokine IL-1b release. Consistently, SHED could inhibit the elevated expression of NLRP3, GSDMD and Caspase-1 induced by CCl 4 treatment in vitro co-culture system, which was mediated by decreasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Moreover, the pyroptosis inhibitor disulfiram showed similar therapeutic effects for liver cirrhosis as SHED. In conclusion, SHED alleviates CCl 4 -induced liver cirrhosis via inhibition of hepatocytes pyroptosis. Our findings could provide a potential treatment strategy and novel target for liver cirrhosis.",

Recent studies showed that MSCs demonstrated promising therapeutic for several immune diseases, including asthma (5) , multiple sclerosis (6) , and COVID-19 (7) . MSCs are considered to be a feasible cell source, which can be isolated from multiple tissues, such as bone marrow (8) , adipose tissue (9) , periodontal ligament (10) , and dental pulp tissue (11) . Among them, stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED) are relatively new and less studied than MSCs from other sources. SHED is easily obtained and relatively free from ethical concerns compared with MSCs derived from other tissues. SHED exhibited a stronger angiogenesis differentiation, proliferation potential (12) , and anti-apoptotic ability over bone marrow MSCs (BMMSCs) (13) . SHED was reported to attenuate liver fibrosis by differentiating into hepatocyte-like cells in vivo (14) , and SHED-derived hepatocyte transplantation also eliminated liver fibrosis (15) . Our previous study showed that SHED could prevent acute hepatitis via inhibition of hepatocyte apoptosis (16) .

IL-1b has been well studied to be an important pro-inflammatory cytokine that drives the pathogenesis of liver inflammation, fibrosis, and injury (31) . In this study, we found that the IL-1b release was increased after CCl 4 treatment. The maturation of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as pro-IL-1b and pro-IL-18 was mediated by the activation of Caspase-1. NLRP3 binds to pro-Caspase-1 and subsequently activates Caspase-1 (32) . GSDMD is found to be a downstream molecule of Caspase-1 and cut into cleaved N-terminal GSDMD (GSDMD-N) and cleaved C-terminal GSDMD (GSDMD-C). GSDMD-N is identified to be the effective form to trigger pyroptosis by punching pores in the cell membrane, and it is inhibited by GSDMD-C when they are combined together (33) . GSDMD-C also mediates the identification process of caspases and GSDMD, and the Caspase-GSDMD-C complex promotes dimerization-mediated caspase activation, rendering a cleavage independently of the cleavage-site tetrapeptide sequence (34) . Matured IL-1b and IL-18 leak from the pores and amplify the inflammatory response. Here we showed that hepatocyte undergoing pyroptosis was mediated by NLRP3 in liver cirrhosis. It is reported that NLRC4 inflammasome was found to mediate the pyroptosis of hepatocytes in NASH, while NLRP3 knockout mice were not protected against hepatocyte pyroptosis (21) . Caspase-11-mediated pyroptosis of hepatocytes was also reported to be involved in alcoholic hepatitis (35) . Whether NLRC4 or Caspase-11 participates in liver cirrhosis needs further investigation.",

Exposed to the ROS, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is at risk for oxidative damage and leaks into the cytosol, which may trigger inflammasome pyroptotic cell death (45) (46) . We found that the cellular ROS was increased and the MMP was decreased in CCl 4 -induced hepatocytes, which indicated that CCl 4 stimulation caused the dysfunction of mitochondria. NLRP3 inflammasome is reported to sense mitochondrial dysfunction (47) , and it might cause the activation of the downstream pyroptosis pathway in hepatocytes. When treated with SHED, the ROS generation was suppressed and MMP returned to a relatively normal level. When treated with NAC, a ROS inhibitor, the pyroptosis pathway was also inhibited. We showed that SHED could decrease the ROS generation and restore the mitochondria function to protect hepatocytes from pyroptosis. In this study, SHED infusion displayed an anti-pyroptosis effect in transwell co-culture experiments, indicating that this effect may be mediated by paracrine secretory factors. It has been reported that MSCs can secrete lots of molecules, such as soluble proteins, lipids, and extracellular vesicles (EVs). MSC-sourced secretome shows profound immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of diseases. Anti-inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-a) and IL-10 are reported to inhibit the proliferation of hepatic stellate cells and decrease collagen synthesis (48, 49) . Hepatocyte growth factor-1 (HGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) secreted by MSCs can stabilize the barrier function of endothelial cells (50) , which may reduce the damage to liver tissue. Recent studies have shown that exosomes are one of the key secretory products of MSCs mediating cell-to-cell communication. Exosome cargo consists of proteins, microRNA (miRNA), mRNA, and mitochondria (51) . MSC-derived exosomes containing miR-542-3p are reported to reduce the expression of ROS and induce cell inflammatory response via inhibiting TLR4 (52) , and the mitochondrial transfer was also reported to play a role in the therapeutic restoration of mitochondrial function by MSCderived exosomes (53) . The exact molecules that displayed the anti-pyroptosis effect in SHED need further investigation. Early studies indicated that SHED may promote liver tissue repair via differentiating into hepatocyte-like cells (14) . By tracing SHED with DiR and CFSE labels, our study showed that SHED was recruited in the liver 1 day after transplantation and decreased in a time-dependent manner (16) . It is reported that the apoptosis of the infusion MSCs increased in a time-dependent manner and display its immunosuppressive by recruiting T cells for FasLmediated apoptosis or inducing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) production in recipient phagocytes (54, 55) . Autophagy of MSCs was also reported to be induced by a liver fibrosis environment (56) . These results indicated that the therapeutic effects of SHED for liver cirrhosis may be dependent on the synergism of paracrine molecules and differentiating into hepatocyte-like cells. However, the precise mechanism for MSC infusion to treat liver cirrhosis needs further investigation.",
