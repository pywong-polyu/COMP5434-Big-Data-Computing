In an option contract, the shipping company commits to order a quantity of containers from the leasing company and has the right to modify its order at a later stage, according to its actual requirement. Under this scheme, the shipping company is allowed to request a smaller or larger number of containers than the agreed initial order. This is done by buying an option premium in advance from the container leasing company. We present numerical results for different scenarios based on information provided by experts in the industry. For the purposes of comparison, a nonoption contract scheme is also evaluated. According to our numerical results, an option contract is better under a scenario where demand is normally distributed with a large standard deviation. This scenario is commonly observed in practice due to the dynamism and volatility of the shipping industry. We conclude that, under an option contract scheme, the shipping company has more flexibility to adjust its demand for containers and to be requested from the leasing company, and this adjustment is compensated by an option price determined according to variations in demand.",

            "text": "Container shipping companies must at all times have available a number of containers for their transport services; these can be owned or leased. Due to East-West trade imbalances, containers need to be continuously repositioned. Trade imbalances mainly occur in the Trans-Pacific and Europe-Asia trades for dry containers and in North-South flows for reefer containers. This results in very large volumes of containers to handle and the need to reposition containers from surplus to deficit areas. As a result, shipping companies suffer from significant repositioning costs that can amount to up to 27% of total container handling costs (Song et al. 2005; Stahlbock and Vo\u00df 2010) . One of the important decisions of a container shipping company is how to manage its fleet of containers and trade imbalances, and in this context, whether to buy or lease containers (Haralambides 2017) . According to Hoffmann et al. (2019) , leasing companies accounted for 55% of container purchases in 2017, and although the fleet size of shipping companies increased by only 2.4%, their leased container stock increased by 6.7%. Several strategies have been employed by shipping companies to reduce operational costs and achieve economies of scale, including cooperative agreements to share investment risks (Caschili et al. 2014) , efficient planning of container stock inventories and repositioning (Olivo et al. 2005; Vojdani et al. 2013; Dang et al. 2013; Moon and Hong 2016; Haralambides 2019) , and decisions on repair and maintenance (Hoffmann et al. 2019) , including leasing of containers. Although leasing containers may be more expensive operationally, leasing provides more flexibility to the shipping lines, enabling them to adjust to shortfalls and shortages of containers and to combine leasing and repositioning decisions, such that, for instance, containers can be picked up at high-demand locations. In addition, shipping lines may be limited in financial resources, such that fully owning the required number of containers is not possible, thus leasing of containers becomes more attractive (Lun et al. 2010 ). However, low manufacturing or leasing costs of containers could favor purchasing or leasing decisions rather than repositioning (Wong et al. 2015) . Moreover, the introduction of foldable containers offers the possibility to reduce container handling costs (Stahlbock and Vo\u00df 2010; Moon and Hong 2016) .",

Some examples include the design of personal employment contracts as a conduit for individualization, to facilitate better employment relationships at ports (Evans and Hudson 1994) . Fisher (2012) provides a study of contracts for ship construction and their impacts on ship design preparation, analyzing the most common contractual factors to be considered in the preparation of such designs (e.g., the contractual answer, i.e., that any question can be answered by the contract itselfmain elements such as agreement, terms and conditions, etc.). Garc\u00eda-Pita (2013) studies the limits between freight contracts, carriage goods by sea contracts, and volume contracts, highlighting that the difference between each contract relies on the corresponding terms and responsibilities defined. Bu et al. (2010) analyze the shipping capacity option contract between carriers and forwarders. They incorporate in their analysis the costs of container repositioning. Their results show that the carrier's expected profit is a concave function of reservation and execution prices, while for the forwarder, it is a concave function of option reservation quantity. The authors also note different effects of container repositioning costs on the optimal decisions of both carrier and forwarder. Hurley and Walker (2013) study the responsibilities, rights, and liabilities of owner, charterer, master, and third parties in a charter party, as dictated by the transportation documents and the charter party.",

Master leases are also called full service leases or container pool management plans. Here, the leasing company assumes full management of the containers, including maintenance and repair as well as repositioning, following off-hire, and contract termination. Depending on location and equipment conditions, a master lease may consider on-hire and off-hire credits or debits. The leasing contract specifies a variable duration, which typically ranges between short and medium term. The contract may also specify a variable number of containers, setting a minimum and maximum number. As highlighted by Rodrigue et al. (2013) , the leasing company acts as a logistics service provider in several ways under this contract. The different costs included in a master leasing contract are illustrated by Lun et al. (2010) and include container rental, depot lift-on/lift-off charges, on-hire/off-hire drayage, drop-off charge, and off-hire repair cost among others.",

The lease normally follows the purchase of new containers by the leasing company. As indicated by Rodrigue et al. (2013) , recent trends involve a shift from master to long-term leases. Another characteristic of this type of lease is that containers are integrated into the fleet of owned containers of the carrier, which enables more effective container handling. Also, they have low business risks and lower rental turnover than master lease contracts. Another important feature is that, under long-term lease contracts, shipping lines have the option of direct interchange of containers with another carrier, something that provides flexibility in the repositioning of containers. In this case, the leasing company charges a fee that is established in the contract. Current trends consider a shift from master leases to long-term leases (Rodrigue et al. 2013 ).",

These authors develop a two-echelon container shipping service contract with bidirectional options, in which the shipping line can adjust the order by both increasing or decreasing the number of containers. Their model includes capacity and fixed order constraints. They consider two profiles of shipping companies: an aggressive and a conservative carrier. The main difference with respect to previous works is that we consider only bidirectional options and not shipping capacity or limited orders of the carrier. Another difference concerns our modeling of prices. Liu et al. (2013) assume a fixed price per container, independently of the quantities finally leased by the shipping company. Here, we assume that the price to pay to the leasing company depends on the variation in the ordered quantity of containers and on the option premium. Demand is considered to be independent. Liu et al. (2013) assume a maximum capacity of the shipping line, which is not the case in our model. Finally, Liu et al. (2013) consider, in particular, a case in China, while our computational experiments consider different regions for the design of the scenarios tested as well as a sensitivity analysis.",

For instance, according to the experience of one of the authors while working for the South American Steam Company [Compa\u00f1\u00eda Sudamericana de Vapores (CSAV)], a major repair cost may be around US $300 per container in Europe, US $50 in China, and US $125 in South America. Values clearly may vary, but this can illustrate the magnitude of such differences. For this reason, shipping lines may not necessarily repair the damaged containers at the same depots where they are first received. A repair process may require approximately one week depending on the level of damage and repairs to be performed. If the container is in good condition, then it may require just a cleaning service or be directly stacked at the corresponding position of the yard. In either case, containers are usually classified according to their condition and quality into three to four categories. Containers without damage are classified as type A, which indicates that they are capable of transporting food cargo, perishables, and in general, fragile cargo. At the other end, containers that are seriously damaged are considered a total loss and discarded. A container for reposition may cost around US $500-700.",

In our case, the leasing company allows the carrier to modify the ordered number of containers by paying an option premium. At each period of time t, demand for containers by a shipping company is an expected value X(t). Demand data are important to calculate the option premium; this is calculated considering four parameters: (1) actual demand in the previous period of time: D(t \u2212 1); (2) average growth rate of demand: r; (3) upper limit of demand growth: u; and (4) lower limit of demand growth: d, where d \u2264 r \u2264 u and d < u. The average growth rate and the limits of demand growth rate should be negotiated by the two companies according to their experience, their statistics, and/or prospective analyses. The higher expected demand at time t, Du(t), and the lower expected demand at time t, Dd(t), are calculated with these parameters. The demand at time t depends on the demand of the previous period (t \u2212 1), as shown in Fig. 1 .",

            "text": "According to our experience and that of experts in the area, leasing companies lease their containers on an annual or longer-term basis. In these contracts, leasing companies commit to make a number of containers available, while shipping companies engage to lease this number of containers during the length of the contract. If the shipping company finally orders fewer containers, a penalty is charged. Contrarily, the containers, if available, will be charged a higher price. Sometimes, leasing companies, knowing the itineraries of the shipping companies, may offer special prices for recovering and/or handling containers from and to specific locations. We propose a contract in which shipping companies determine a first approximate container demand per month and then place their final order. The modifications of this final order are settled by paying an option premium. In addition to the fluctuations in the demand for containers, shipping companies also need to renew their fleet of containers when a container's useful economic life gets to its end. If this renewal process is planned in advance, more beneficial contract terms can be negotiated between the shipping line and the leasing company. We can mention CSAV as an example of a shipping line which, when it was operating, implemented option contracts as part of its strategy of leasing containers. ",

            "text": "We propose a bidirectional option contracts model for the issue of leasing containers. Two stakeholders are involved: a shipping company and a leasing company. The issue considers the decision regarding the quantity of containers to be leased. Under an option contracts model, the shipping company is allowed to eventually request a bigger or smaller number of containers than its initial order, buying in advance an option premium. Numerical results considering different scenarios that represent real-life situations faced by a shipping company during a planning horizon of 12 months allowed us to compare an option contracts approach with the baseline scenario where nonoption contracts are used. From the results, we can conclude that the use of option contracts is an interesting strategy in cases where demand approximates a normal distribution. In cases of uniform or decreasing demand, option contracts do not significantly increase profits. In practice, the assumption of a uniform distribution is less likely to occur; a reason why an option contract approach may be suitable. Furthermore, in the case of demand following the normal distribution, it was possible to obtain higher sold units as well as lower lost sales. Our results indicate that an option contract should be considered when demand is normally distributed with a high standard deviation. These results show the advantage of an option contract under a demand of high variability, which is the case of the global shipping industry. By using this strategy, leasing companies are able to provide a more flexible service, and in exchange, they will receive compensation (option premium) for the changes and the adjustments in the final order.",
