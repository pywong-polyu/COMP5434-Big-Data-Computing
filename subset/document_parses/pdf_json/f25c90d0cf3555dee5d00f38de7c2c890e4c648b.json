All patients underwent LDCT. The protocol was approved by the local institutional review board: institut hospitalo-universitaire m\u00e9dit\u00e9ran\u00e9e-infection N\u02da:2020-0012. The exclusion criteria was protocol refusal. For each patient, the following clinical parameters were recorded: age, sex, date of first symptoms, date of chest CT scan, delay between the first symptom and chest CT scan, fever, cough, dyspnea, diarrhea, myalgia, rhinorrhea, abnormalities at lung auscultation, temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, and oxygen needed. Medical history parameters were recorded as follows: heart disease, tobacco use, COPD, asthma, diabetes, obesity, sleep apnea syndrome, oncologic status and immunosuppression status. The National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was calculated for each patient using respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, supplemental oxygen needed, temperature, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and AVPU score, as described previously [10] . The NEWS determines the degree of illness of a patient and prompts critical care intervention. According to previously published data, patients were divided into the following two groups based on the NEWS in order to compare the radiological data in these populations: low NEWS (NEWS \ufffd 4) and high NEWS (NEWS > 4) groups [10] .",

Lack of involvement was defined as a normal pattern and was equivalent to 0. Minimal involvement was defined as the presence of maximum 10 secondary lobules of any features and was equivalent to 1. Intermediate involvement was defined as less than 50% involvement of the segment by any features and was equivalent to 4. Severe involvement was defined as more than 50% involvement of the segment by any feature and was equivalent to 10. The score was obtained by summing the score of all segments for the right and left lungs, with the result ranking between 0 corresponding to a normal chest CT and 200 if all segments had involvement of more than 50% of their volume (Fig 1) . Chest-CT was considered with high impairment if the global score was superior to 50, we compared two groups to assess if clinical data could be predictor of severe involvement of lung parenchyma.",

Low-and high-risk groups. Unenhanced chest CT was performed using a low-dose acquisition protocol. All the CT scans performed allowed optimal analysis of parenchyma involvement. Recently, recommendations have been made regarding the use of LDCT for COVID19 that indicate preference for LDCT [15] . They reported a mean dose-length product of 14.4 mGy.cm. A patient with COVID-19 pneumonia could have 3 to 6 chest CT scans in a short period of time, and a healthy patient could have 1 or 2 chest CT scans to ensure that they did not have COVID-19 [16] . Irradiation awareness is needed, especially for younger patients [17] . The present study showed that CT image quality using LDCT is sufficient for depicting all the typical features of COVID-19 pneumopathy. Acquisition parameters settings should be adapted to each patient to maintain good contrast-to-noise ratio and signal-to-noise ratio, allowing adequate quality of the lung parenchyma images [18] . Debray et al. have already shown in patients with lung transplantation that the use of LDCT could be interesting to decrease global irradiation because of repeated imaging for follow-up [19] . However, in patients with COVID-19 an enhanced chest CT scan might be required for patients with clinical worsening considering an over-risk of pulmonary embolism caused by inflammatory syndrome and bed rest.",

Lesions extent is higher in patients with a need for intensive care units than for ordinary units. In particular, lymph nodes and pleural effusion are highly frequent in severe patients. The present paper is in favor of a correlation between disease extent and clinical severity. There are some patients with a RT-PCR positive result and a normal chest CT 23 of 80 (28%), that is not consistent with the whole studies on CT scan sensitivity. We explained that because patients came from a screening center and some patients are tested because they are contact case with infected patients. The sensitivity of the CT scan depends on the level of pre-test risk of the population to present lung involvement. Disappointingly, we did not highlight any symptoms that could predict pulmonary involvement, particularly cough, which is generally one of the main symptoms of manifestations of alveolar involvement. It is in line with a recent publication from Yang et al. showing that patients could be COVID-19 infected and had few or no clinical symptoms with a normal chest CT and/or negative RT-PCR test [22] .",

This type of CT score was first described in 2004 for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Investigators divided each lung into 3 parts (upper, middle and lower) and evaluated the involvement on a scale of 0-4: 0, <25%, 25-50 >50% and >75% involvement: the maximum possible score was 24 [23] . The present approach uses the simplest scale, comprising 3 kinds of impairment: minimal, intermediate, and severe. It focuses on the anatomical distribution of lesions based on segmental analysis. This scoring system is based on the decreased in lung function applayed in thoracic surgery. It has been shown that wedge resection spare parenchyma loss more than segmentectomy and segmentectomy more than lobectomy [24] . We guess that a minimal involvement will have only few consequences on hematosis and more than 50% of segment involvement seems lead to a total shunt effect and we grade it 10. The score over 50/200 had been arbitrary chosen for severe involvement because that mean involvement of 50% of the lung corresponding to a lobectomy. Patients with comorbidities such as emphysema or former thoracic surgery have a higher risk of death in case of lobectomy [25] . We considered that a score > 50/200 could lead to death according to the cormobidities and need to classify patients in the severe group.",

Our population was mainly paucisymptomatic patients which did not allow us to have a wide repartition of NEWS and CT scores for correlation, especially for high scores. This could be explained because we enrolled the 80 first patients with COVID-19 pneumonia in our centre and the severe forms are not the most frequent. Another limit is the low number of patient that does not allowed us to perform a multivariate analysis and further studies are needed to establish this score a clinical prognosis tool.",
