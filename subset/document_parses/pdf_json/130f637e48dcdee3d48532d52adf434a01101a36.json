We aim to establish the feasibility of such a workflow and potential impacts, and identify key components and potential barriers to implementation.",

We combined genomic and epidemiologic data to identify the number of MDRO transmissions that occurred within and between hospitals, including up to 12 months prior to first MDRO identification. We demonstrated that vanA VRE was most likely to be acquired due to transmissions in hospitals.

Taken together, studies of whole genome sequencing of MDROs in hospitals demonstrate the enormous potential for precision infection control interventions at the hospital level to be guided by this data. The next steps in transitioning from research to implementation require close engagement between hospital infection control teams, diagnostic microbiology laboratories and laboratories with expertise in genome sequencing and analysis, to create workflows that are efficient and sustainable in different settings, and accurately and rapidly communicate results to maximise the benefits to hospitals and patients. Our study also demonstrates that integrated data across multiple sites can inform higher level public health decision making regarding the notification and systematic surveillance of MDRO threats. Future implementation of whole genome sequencing for hospital infection control should consider and integrate a multilayered approach (hospital and network/state level) to ensure that the data can inform precision infection control interventions at the hospital level as well as inform system-wide decision making. Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-Ec and ESBL-Kp) (see Supplementary data for details). Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii complex (CRAb) and carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPa) were also included in the pilot phase, 21 but excluded here due to low prevalence. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CPE) were excluded, as these were already under genomic surveillance as part of the state-wide CPE surveillance program. 22 As the pathogens included in the study were not notifiable by legislation, no specific public health interventions or reporting was in place that the time, and infection control units managed these independently. Due to the large volume of ESBL-Ec included during the pilot phase, we modified inclusion criteria for the implementation phase to only include ESBL-Ec that were also resistant to fluoroquinolones, as this was more consistent with existing infection control practices at participating sites.",

The genomics program was particularly useful in identifying MDRO outbreaks occurring over a longer period of time, which had not been detected by conventional surveillance methods. Outbreak investigations were supported by including genomic analysis of historical and environmental isolates (including shared patient equipment), allowing infection control teams to trace the likely transmission pathways, and implement targeted measures to prevent further spread. This was especially useful where epidemiological links were complex, such as when a patient may have been exposed to vanA VREfm in more than one location, making attribution of MDRO acquisition impossible with epidemiologic data alone. Furthermore, genomics allowed the cessation of screening in one vanA VREfm outbreak, by demonstrating that new cases outside this ward were not related to the original outbreak, thus saving considerable resources and allowing the ward to re-open to new admissions.",

We have demonstrated wideranging impacts of prospective genomic surveillance, identifying MDRO transmission where it was not suspected, providing support for outbreak investigations, and data to inform public health coordination of hospital-acquired infections. We believe that this is a critical step towards changing how we think about MDROs in hospitals, no longer relying on low-resolution traditional microbiological and epidemiologic surveillance, but proactively detecting MDRO transmission at a genomic level. This then enables early and tailored infection control interventions, potentially limiting the number of patients infected, morbidity and mortality, and saving limited hospital resources. 4, 18, 25, 26 This is most relevant with more common MDROs found in both hospitals and the community, as hospital transmission may be under-estimated without precision genomic data. 4 Importantly, most of the MDRO transmission detected here would not have been identified by existing infection control surveillance, offering huge opportunities to detect silent MDRO transmission, and intervene. Implementing a new workflow represents a major change for hospital laboratories and infection control teams, and identifies challenges to be overcome for successful implementation. samples). 27 With adequate resourcing and buy-in from hospital laboratories, and capacity in sequencing laboratories, similar TATs could be achieved for MDRO surveillance. Alternatively, a decentralised genomics model (local WGS and analysis, or hybrid model with centralised analysis) may also optimise TATs; the choice of model ultimately depends on the available resources in each setting. 28 Other key challenges include the optimisation of bioinformatics processes 29 and integration of epidemiologic data, without which the genomic analyses are not interpretable. 30, 31 In our study, the linkage of genomic and epidemiologic data was impaired by poor integration with electronic medical records; this integration would be an important component for successful implementation in the future. 32 Communication of complex genomic results to a new clinical setting is another challenge for implementation. Ideally, results should be easy to comprehend, Optimise utility of prospective genomics by targeting to local MDROs or locations of concern; demonstrate cost-effectiveness of prospective genomics LIS, laboratory information system; MLST, multi-locus sequence type (a typing method to subset isolates of the same species into smaller, closely-related groups for targeted transmission analysis); MDRO, multidrug-resistant organism.",

In this study, we used genomic links (SNP thresholds) and epidemiologic data (overlapping admissions in space and time) to call probable or possible transmission, similar to other studies. 25, 34 SNP thresholds are a relatively blunt instrument to suggest potential genomic links, but core genome SNP analyses are accepted to be far higher resolution than existing typing methods (such as MLST), and at least equivalent to core genome MLST. 35, 36 Importantly, SNP thresholds are specific to the methods used to derive them, hence other studies using lower thresholds are not directly comparable to this study. 32, 34 In a pragmatic sense, if high-resolution core genome SNP methods are used for large-scale prospective genomics, then SNP thresholds are likely to be required; however, future studies in this area should be open to exploring alternative methods and thresholds. 29, 34, 35, 37 Our study has a number of limitations. Firstly, screening practices were not standardised between hospitals, and included one site performing a biannual hospital-wide point-prevalence survey. However, many transmissions were still identified at hospitals performing less screening; this suggests the potential advantages of additional screening to uncover unsuspected transmissions. Secondly, bed movement data would ideally have been acquired for all study patients; this was addressed in the pilot study and did not greatly change the interpretation of the transmission data. 19 Third, these methods are not designed to detect transmission of AMR plasmids mechanisms, as short-read sequencing methods are limited in this ability.",
