Two drugs of interest, Guaifenesin and Bromohexine HCl, are among the add-on therapy for treatment of COVID-19 mild cases, which has raised the need for their simultaneous determination. The analysis of the two drugs of interest was described using ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometric (UPLC-MS/MS) in plasma of healthy human volunteers using tetryzoline HCl as an internal standard (IS) after liquid-liquid extraction. The applied chromatographic conditions were Kinetex C 18 (100 \u00c5, 2.6 \u00b5m X 50 mm X 4.6 mm) column and a mixture of methanol: water (95: 5, v/v) as a mobile phase at flow rate 1 mL/min. The positive ionization mode was used for detecting the ions, by observing the pairs of transition m/z 199 < 125 for GUF, m/z 377 < 114 for BRM and m/z 201 < 131 for IS. The linearity range was from 50 to 1500 ng/mL for GUF and 0.5-50 \u00b5g/mL for BRM. Limit of detection (LOD) was found to be 35.16 and 0.43 ng/ml for GUF and BRM, respectively. The method was validated according to FDA guidance.",

Various symptoms were reported to accompany COVID-19 such as fatigue, fever, diarrhea, cough and short breath [2] .

Moreover, the potential of BRM as an add-on therapy was recently discussed [7] . Add-on therapy is defined as a treatment which bolster or support the effectiveness of a previous one. The transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) enzyme is responsible for breaking or priming of the S protein required for the viral fusion to the host cell at the ACE2 receptor followed by viral entry and replication, as shown in Supplementary Material Fig. 1SM . Several studies showed that at maximum clinical doses of BRM, (TMPRSS2) is strongly and specifically inhibited [8, 9] , which can block the pulmonary virus infection [10] . Through the second wave of pandemic, the number of COVID-19 cases among children has increased [1], where the role of BRM becomes remarkable due to the reported studies of the use of BRM in pediatric COVID-19 cases along with its rare side effects [11, 12] . Meanwhile, the medical centers for Universities of Nebraska-Lincoln [13] and Maryland [14] recommended the use of preparations containing GUF such as Mucinex\u00ae for the home treatment and relief of symptoms.",

It helps to relief the chest congestion and cough caused by common cold and bronchitis through reducing the viscosity of mucus in the respiratory tract which makes the cough easier. Bromhexine (BRM) is 2,4-Dibromo-6-([cyclohexyl (methyl)amino] methyl) aniline. BRM is used as a mucolytic as it works by loosening the mucus. BRM increases the production of mucus in the airways, thus decreases the viscosity of phlegm and promotes the coughing out. GUF and BRM are over-the-counter medications usually co-administrated due to their synergistic effect in treatment of chest congestion and cough.

The maximum benefit is achieved when merging the possibilities of UPLC with MS/MS detection which is defined by its sensitivity and specificity. UPLC coupled with MS/MS detection is the method of choice for analysis of different matrices such as biological tissues or fluids [28] , food samples [29, 30] , environmental samples [31] [32] [33] .",

Methanol: water (60:40, v/v) was tried but the chromatogram of GUF and BRM indicated forked and tailed peaks, respectively. Another trial was done using higher amount of methanol (methanol: water, 80:20, v/v), where the GUF peak was sharper with small noise but the BRM peak was also tailed. Finally, Kinetex C 18 (100 \u00c5, 2.6 \u00b5m X 50 mm X 4.6 mm) column was used with a mobile phase of methanol: water (95:5, v/v). The resulted chromatograms showed sharp and symmetric resolved peaks with improved sensitivity of the analytes. Positive ion mode in ESI source using multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) was applied. The MRM of the protonated precursor parent ions [M + H] + were measured at m/z 199 for GUF, 377 for BRM and 301 for internal standard (IS). The following product ions were selected at 125, 114 and 131 for GUF, BRM and IS, respectively, Fig. 1 . The total runtime was found to be around 2 min which is relatively much shorter than the reported method [48] where the runtime reached 6 min.",

It is presented by a pictogram divided into five risk potentials: a) health, b) safety, c) environmental, 4) waste, and 5) energy [58] with a score from (1-3) : 1) green, 2) yellow and 3) red. These scores are calculated according to National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) codes and standards [59] . Environment and waste pentagrams are scored according to its yield (<50 g, 50-250 g and > 250 g). Energy pentagram is scored in terms of solvent evaporation by the apparatus. By comparing the proposed and reported methods as shown in Table 4 , the proposed method showed two green potentials (b and e), while reported method showed a yellow \"b\" safety potential due to the use of formic acid and ammonia solution as part of the mobile phase. Both methods showed yellow (a, c, and d) representing a medium health potential, low energy consumption and low environmental impact.",

            "text": "Wasylka [60] presented GAPI tool to elaborate much data than previous tools. Each method is presented by five pentagrams subdivided into smaller sections in order to assess 15 analytical aspects, as in Supplementary Material Table 3SM . The shade of each section is red -yellow -green according to impact from highmedium -low. Both proposed and reported methods showed much detailed profiles than the previous tools, where red pentagrams were measured for the first time. Resemblance of GAPI pentagrams of both methods were observed regarding the type of method, the sample (collectionpreservationtransportstoragepreparation), instrumentation and waste treatment. The proposed method transcended the reported one in terms of safety hazard of solvents use, due to the use of formic acid and ammonia in the reported method, number of grams of used solvents and generated waste (aspects 9, 11 and 14), as shown in Table 4 . The Eco-Scale [61] is the only quantitative tool that can compare the greenness of several methods on a common scale from (0 -100). Penalty points are calculated for every factor in a method, then sum of penalty points is subtracted from 100 to calculate its eco-scale. The penalty points are calculated for several aspects including: the hazard and amounts of the reagents used; the method of extraction; energy, occupational hazard and the waste produced by the instruments. An ideal green method will have eco-scale of 100, excellent is > 75, acceptable is > 50 and inadequate is < 50. The Eco-Scale for the reported and proposed methods was calculated as shown in Table 5 , it was found that the eco-scale of the proposed method was equal to be 78 points (excellent) versus 70 points for the reported one. The reported method suffered from a lower Eco-Scale due to the use of several non-green solvents such as formic acid and ammonium solution, in addition to the longer runtime (6 min in comparison to 2 min for the proposed method) and higher flow rate which accordingly increased the amounts of reagents used and the waste produced.

The proposed UPLC-MS/MS method was applied to determine the plasma concentrations GUF and BRM in a pharmacokinetic study involving Egyptian healthy volunteers showing no difference of the studied pharmacokinetic parameters versus the reported method. Finally, the proposed UPLC-MS/MS method was found to be more ecofriendly than the reported one using four assessment tools.",
