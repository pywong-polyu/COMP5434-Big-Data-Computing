            "text": "While SARS-CoV2 vaccines have shown an unprecedented success, the ongoing emergence of new variants and necessity to adjust vaccines justify the development of alternative prophylaxis and therapy approaches. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy using a secreted CoV2 decoy receptor protein (sACE2-Ig) would involve a one-time intervention resulting in long-term protection against airway infection, viremia, and extrapulmonary symptoms. We recently developed a technically simple and portable in vivo hematopoietic HSC transduction approach that involves HSC mobilization from the bone marrow into the peripheral blood stream and the intravenous injection of an integrating, helper-dependent adenovirus (HDAd5/35 ++ ) vector system. Considering the abundance of erythrocytes, in this study, we directed sACE2-Ig expression to erythroid cells using strong b-globin transcriptional regulatory elements. We performed in vivo HSC transduction of CD46-transgenic mice with an HDAd-sACE2-Ig vector. Serum sACE2-Ig levels reached 500-1,300 ng/mL after in vivo selection. At 22 weeks, we used genetically modified HSCs from these mice to substitute the hematopoietic system in human ACE2-transgenic mice, thus creating a model that is susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection. Upon challenge with a lethal dose of CoV2 (WA-1), sACE2-Ig expressed from erythroid cells of test mice diminishes infection sequelae. Treated mice lost significantly less weight, had less viremia, and displayed reduced cytokine production and lung pathology. The second objective of this study was to assess the safety of in vivo HSC transduction and long-term sACE2-Ig expression in a rhesus macaque. With appropriate cytokine prophylaxis, intravenous injection of HDAd-sACE2-Ig into the mobilized animal was well tolerated. In vivo transduced HSCs preferentially localized to and survived in the spleen. sACE2-Ig expressed from erythroid cells did not affect erythropoiesis and the function of erythrocytes. While these pilot studies are promising, the antiviral efficacy of the approach has to be improved, for example, by using of decoy receptors with enhanced neutralizing capacity and/or expression of multiple antiviral effector proteins.",

            "text": "INTRODUCTION DURING THE PAST 5 years, we developed a new in vivo hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy approach. It involves the mobilization of HSCs from the bone marrow by granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and the short-acting CXCR4 antagonist Plerixafor/AMD3100. While mobilized HSCs circulate at high numbers in the periphery, HDAd5/35 ++ vectors are injected intravenously. 1 Mobilization of HSCs is critical for in vivo transduction because in the bone marrow, they are surrounded by extracellular stroma proteins, 2 and are not accessible to gene transfer vectors. 3 HDAd5/35 ++ vectors are easy to manufacture at high yields, can carry a payload of 35 kb, and efficiently transduce primitive, quiescent HSCs through CD46. 3 The vectors' affinity to CD46 has been increased 4 to allow for in vivo HSC transduction without significant vector uptake by hepatocytes. 5, 6 Random integration of HDAd5/35 ++ vectors is mediated by an activity-enhanced Sleeping Beauty transposase (SB100x). 7 To expand transduced HSCs, we currently use an in vivo selection mechanism based on a mutant O 6methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (mgmt P140K ) gene that confers resistance to O 6 -BG/BCNU (O 6 -Benzylguanine/ Carmustine). [8] [9] [10] After in vivo transduction and selection with three low doses of O 6 -BG/BCNU administered intraperitoneally with an interval of 2 weeks, transgene marking in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) is usually increased to >90%. 8 Our approach resulted in phenotypic correction in mouse disease models of thalassemia intermedia, 11 sickle cell disease, and murine hemophilia A, 12 and in the reversion of spontaneous cancer. 13 Recently, we also demonstrated its safety and efficacy in rhesus macaques. 14 We hypothesized that the abundance of erythroid cells can be harnessed for high-level production of therapeutic proteins (84% of the cells in the human body are red blood cells [20-30 trillion ] and 2.5 \u00b7 10 6 erythrocytes are made per second). We demonstrated that our approach allows for stable supraphysiological plasma concentrations of a bioengineered human factor VIII, termed ET3, which was expressed from an erythroid-specific b-globin locus control region (LCR). 12 Our study also suggested the ET3 was secreted from erythroid cells in the bone marrow or released from circulating erythrocytes during senescence. Despite high-level ET3 production from erythroid cells, no effect on hematopoiesis was observed.",

[19] [20] [21] Furthermore, viremia after lytic infection of lung epithelium is documented by reports that measured both infectious particles and/or viral RNA in blood, whereby the virus load in blood correlated strongly with disease severity. 22 To disrupt the virus replication and pathological effects, monoclonal antibodies directed against the S-protein are being used. 23, 24 Another group of therapeutics are virus decoy receptors. The development of recombinant ACE2-Fc fusion proteins (hACE2-Fc or hACE2-Ig) started early in the pandemic. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Unlike S protein neutralizing antibodies, hACE2-Fc treatment did not induce the development of escape mutants.

Jim Wilson's groups tested an rAAV vector expressing an affinityenhanced ACE2-Fc and demonstrated that the expression of this decoy receptor in the proximal airway significantly diminished clinical and pathologic consequences of SARS-CoV2 challenge in a mouse model. 31 They also showed that therapeutic levels of sACE2-Fc can be achieved in nonhuman primates after intranasal delivery.",

It results in continuous release of sACE2-Ig from erythroid cells into the blood stream. High plasma sACE2-Ig levels could block viremia and extrapulmonary symptoms. Because sACE2-Ig is expressed continuously, it could be used prophylactically in individuals who cannot be vaccinated (e.g., hypersensitive patients) or lack a functional immune system (e.g., HIV/AIDS patients).",

The biodistribution and function of CD46 in mice and humans are different. 38 In humans, CD46 is present on all nucleated cells, while the expression of the mouse CD46 ortholog is restricted to the testis. For our in vivo HSC transduction studies, we therefore used human CD46-transgenic mice. These mice carry 400 kb of the human CD46 locus 39 and express the protein in a pattern similar to humans. 32 For in vivo transduction in CD46-transgenic mice, HSCs were mobilized with G-CSF/AMD3100 and intravenously injected with HDAd-sACE2-Ig plus HDAd-SB ( Fig. 2A) . Four weeks later, mice were subjected to O 6 BG/BCNU in vivo selection to expand sACE2-Ig-expressing erythroid progenitor cells. Serum sACE2-Ig levels reached 500-1,300 ng/mL after the fifth cycle of selection (Fig. 2B) . At week 22, in vivo transduced mice were euthanized and bone marrow lineage-negative (lin -) cells (which are enriched for HSCs) were transplanted into lethally irradiated K18-hACE2 mice to create an sACE2-Ig-expressing mouse model that is susceptible to SARS-CoV2 infection (see section ''CoV2 challenge studies in sACE2-Ig expressing K18-hACE2-transgenic mice'').",

Importantly, because our HDAd5/35 ++ vector was designed not to transduce hepatocytes, liver transaminases remained within the normal range. As seen in mice, sACE2-Ig production in erythroid cells did not affect red blood cell parameters. As expected, G-CSF/AMD3100 mobilization triggered transient leukocytopenia that normalized by day 7. Also, related to mobilization and HDAd5/35 ++ injection, a mild, transient thrombocytopenia was observed during the first 4 days. In the bone marrow, G-CSF/AMD3100 mobilization increased the fraction of CD14 + cells and decreased the percentage of CD3 + cells, both of which returned to normal levels by week 1.",

The sACE2-Ig expression cassette contains a 4.3 kb version of the human b-globin LCR consisting of four DNAse HS regions and b-globin promoter. The cDNA encoding secreted, extracellular domain of human ACE2 fused to human constant IgG(c1) domains was synthesized and inserted after LCR/b-promoter, two active-site histidine residues were mutated (H374N and H378N) to reduce the catalytic activity of ACE2. HA tag was inserted in the N-terminal for detection. The human b-globin 3\u00a2UTR (for mRNA stabilization in erythrocytes) was used. The vector also contains an expression cassette for MGMT P140K allowing for in vivo selection of transduced HSPCs and HSPC progeny. The bidirectional SV40 poly-adenylation signal is used to terminate transcription. To avoid interference between the LCR/b-promoter and EF1a promoter, a 1.2 kb chicken HS4 chromatin insulator was inserted between the cassettes. (B) Antibody-like structure of sACE2-Ig.
