Clinical factors highlighted the influence of knowledge or perceptions about appropriate clinical applications, therapeutic efficacy, safety and ethical concerns, and patient engagement. Organisational factors emphasised the importance of service contexts, including having a strong business case, stakeholder planning, recruitment of local opinion leaders to champion change, and an understanding of resourcing challenges. Professional factors highlighted the need for education and training for staff, and the influence of staff attitudes towards technology and perceived usability of VR.",

VR is a computer-generated three-dimensional environment that enables immersive multisensory experiences, typically through using a head-mounted display, headphones and hand-held controllers. VR affords a sense of \"presence\" (i.e., \"being there\") and embodiment of a virtual body, which can be exploited to enhance traditional psychological treatment by providing safe, ecologically valid virtual environments to modify maladaptive thoughts, behaviours and internal body representations (3, 4) . Moreover, VR offers advantages in providing greater access and control over stimuli otherwise impractical or costly to replicate in clinical settings (2, 5) . The largest clinical application has been VR exposure therapy (VRET) for anxiety-related disorders (e.g., phobias, social anxiety, agoraphobia, PTSD), with over 30 randomised control trials supporting its efficacy, with equivalent effect sizes (6) and attrition rates to in vivo exposure therapy (7, 8) . Moreover, evidence supporting its efficacy across an increasingly broad range of conditions is growing, including autism-spectrum disorder, addictions, eating disorders, and psychosis (9, 10) .",

Indeed, some have predicted that VR \"will soon become standard tools in the toolbox\" of clinicians (11) . To this effect, the National Institute of Health Research (NIHR) awarded \u00a34 million to support trialling of VR-based psychological therapies through the United Kingdom's publicly funded healthcare system (12) . However, implementing VR into mainstream clinical settings will be challenging, as historically, only about half of new evidence-based practises reach widespread adoption, taking on average 17 years to become routinised (13) . Moreover, this lag appears even greater for psychological treatments (14) .",

(18) , these studies have focused narrowly on applications in exposure therapy, leaving knowledge about its wider implementation within general mental health services scant.

To be eligible, participants needed to be a current staff member of the hospital, with clinical or managerial experience. Purposive sampling was used to identify participants with diverse disciplinary backgrounds (including psychiatry, psychology, nursing, and allied health) and those who had experience in providing clinical care and managing operations of a private psychiatric service. Respondents from a previous survey study who had indicated their willingness to be involved in future interviews (Chung et al., in preparation), as well as staff identified by managers as potential informants who could provide rich information about potential applications, were invited to participate via email or phone. Sampling was further influenced by, and ceased, when thematic saturation was achieved. Respective interview schedules for clinicians and managers were pilot-tested and emailed to participants prior to interviews. Questions probed the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of VR, as these have been identified by Proctor and colleagues (24) as critical constructs to understand for early implementation, alongside barriers and facilitators relevant to participants' roles and service. Additionally, managers were asked to reflect on implementation experiences and processes around organisational change. Interviewers, O.C (PhD candidate, BA Hons/BSci) and A.J (Student, BA Hons) were female and trained by T.R (Researcher, PhD), an experienced qualitative researcher. Interviewers had no prior relationships with participants. Interviews were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim by a professional transcription service, and reviewed for accuracy by the research team. Interviewers maintained field notes and regularly debriefed with co-authors, with discussions influenced by backgrounds in neuropsychology, psychology, nursing, implementation, and qualitative research. Transcripts were de-identified prior to entry into NVivo for analysis (version 12; QS International).",

To ensure accuracy, transcripts were compared to their original audio files, and read and re-read by OC, who performed line-by-line coding, conceptualised the data and inductively identified similar concepts. A preliminary codebook was created by OC from identified concepts, which provided definitions, descriptions, qualifications, and examples utterances of codes, and which allowed the team to see and record how codes were being applied to the data (27, 28) . Transcripts (15%) were co-coded against the codebook (OC, TR, RS) to enhance coding consistency and transparency around coding decisions. Coders met regularly to compare codes and interrogate themes against the study aim, helping to ensure confirmability of findings and reduce risk of thematic interpretation bias. The codebook was iteratively refined with input from co-coders, with subthemes and codes continuously added, revised, and arranged into meaningful groups until there was consensus regarding emerging primary and secondary themes. The codebook was considered final when a draft version of the codebook was applied to a larger data set and no new codes emerged. All transcripts were subsequently recoded by OC against the final codebook. Links among themes were used to develop a thematic schema.",

Enablers included participants' perception of VR as a tool that could enhance patients' engagement with treatment, and strong endorsement for its use in anxiety-related disorders, which is unsurprising given the predominance of exposure-based applications (2) . In contrast, uncertainty regarding VR use with people experiencing psychosis and significant cognitive impairment (e.g., dementia) was a barrier, suggesting applications beyond exposure have less intuitive validity and can increase risk perception. Other barriers identified included the mixed views regarding the likely therapeutic efficacy of VRbased interventions, and safety and ethical concerns. These concerns are similar to Lindner et al. (18) , in highlighting limited awareness of the current evidence-base, including that of the strong emerging evidence of safe and effective VR applications for individuals living with psychosis and Alzheimer's disease (29) (30) (31) and established treatment transfer effects in anxiety disorders (32, 33) . This may result in some \"pushback\" against applications that do not directly replicate current treatment models, which may further limit acceptance of emerging VR applications that \"go beyond\" what is achievable in real life to address complex, treatment-resistant symptoms (2, 19) . The current findings also suggest that introducing VR may reinforce existing barriers to evidence-based practise uptake, as concerns about patients becoming \"distressed\" reflect iatrogenic misconceptions that have historically hindered exposure therapy dissemination and led to suboptimal delivery (34, 35) . Similarly, CBT for psychosis has achieved variable implementation rates (i.e., 4-100%) and is infrequently offered to patients, which has been attributed to gaps in clinicians' knowledge, inaccurate beliefs regarding patient appropriateness, and prioritisation of pharmacological approaches (36, 37) . Thus, addressing provider knowledge gaps and misconceptions will be an important focus of dissemination and implementation efforts (see implications for future implementation).",

While financial, staffing, and logistical resourcing challenges were perceived to be the greatest barrier, the facilitatory role of a strong business case in an organisation's decision to adopt VR was highlighted. Notably, considerations for economic viability tend to be more salient for private organisations (38) . As therapeutic VR is not currently reimbursed by private health funds, services may lack sufficient incentive to adopt VR if it is more costly than current practises. Thus, in making a business case for VR, it may be helpful to consider Rogers' Theory of Innovation Diffusion (39) , which highlights the influence of innovation attributes on implementation outcomes. Providing staff opportunities to trial therapeutic VR environments and emphasising its \"relative advantages\" over current practises and workflows will likely be beneficial. For instance, VR can overcome challenges associated with delivering exposure therapy (e.g., inaccessible stimuli) and there is evidence to suggest it can be more acceptable to patients (40, 41) , which may increase service demand and engagement.",

These were clearly reflected in the current findings, and have practical implications for future dissemination and implementation efforts. Limited telehealth use prior to the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrates that technology accessibility does not guarantee successful dissemination if providers remain uninformed about evidence-based practises or perceive potential risks as outweighing benefits (54) . Thus, given the lack of specific clinical guidelines, and limited treatment protocols and training programs for therapeutic VR, their development and dissemination should be prioritised. Such resources will be critical to enhance provider confidence and competence to select appropriate VR systems for their service and patients' needs, particularly considering the rapid pace that VR technology and its therapeutic evidence-base is advancing. Consultation opportunities with early adopters of VR-based therapies may promote uptake by improving providers' perceived capacity to manage implementation risks (21, 55) . Targeting concerns and misconceptions related to therapeutic VR's clinical appropriateness will be critical given the stronger influence of negative attitudes (negative predictor) than positive on therapists' intention to use it (18) . It would also be beneficial to embed VR into clinical training programs as part of developing competencies in digital mental health (54) . As the current data were also similar to constructs common in theoretical frameworks [e.g., Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (56), Theoretical Domains Framework (57) ], these may be suitable tools to guide comprehensive identification of mechanisms of change targets and development of relevant implementation strategies to enhance uptake of therapeutic VR.",

This will be particularly relevant with the rise of psychedelic pharmacotherapy for psychiatric indications (63) , as the combination could conceivably help or hinder therapeutic outcomes.

The findings, should be considered with some limitations in mind, including its specificity to private sector health services and the higher proportion of nursing staff in the sample, relative to other clinical disciplines (psychiatrists, psychologists, allied health). This does, however, reflect the typical staff distribution within mental health hospitals. Moreover, with emerging evidence for automated applications (e.g., virtual therapy coach), VR is increasingly likely to be delivered by any clinicians irrespective of their training background, whose role would be primarily to provide a technical or supportive role (64) . Going forward, expanding findings to public mental health services will be valuable. It will be especially important to investigate the perspectives and needs of consumers of mental health services, and to communicate these to service providers and embed them in implementation initiatives. Future research may consider applying broader theoretical frameworks to guide identification of behavioural determinants and implementation intervention development.",

Barriers (dark grey) included safety and ethical concerns, and resourcing challenges. Factors representing mixed barriers and enablers depending on their presence or absence (light grey) include knowledge of and perceptions about clinical applications and their therapeutic efficacy, a service culture supportive of innovation, perceived usability of VR systems, and favourable staff attitudes towards technology. Enablers (white) include perceptions that VR will enhance patient engagement with treatment, having a strong business case, collaborative stakeholder planning, the use of local opinion leaders to champion change and provision of education and training to staff.Thus, dissemination of efficacy evidence and having a clear evaluation plan for any implementation were identified as crucial clinical factors to address:\"You just need to have a clear evidence base, or some evidence and here's now we're going to do ongoing evaluation. . . these are the settings that it has evidence for, this is the protocol. . .
