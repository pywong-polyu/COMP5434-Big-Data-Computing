The study focuses on a much-neglected cultural context, Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC), since Student's readiness as well as institutions and professors' endowments greatly varied within countries and among universities. The study further incorporates Instructors attitudes and evaluates the mediation effect of Academic engagement on Academic achievement. The methodology relies on Partial Least Squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM). The research findings emphasize the role of E-learning environment, Digital readiness, Academic engagement, students as well as instructors E-learning attitude as the decisive factors that determine students' Academic achievement. This implies that institutions who adapt to a changing environment by aligning students and instructors' goals to develop a positive and supportive E-learning environment, will foment Academic engagement and promote students' Academic achievement.",

Rather than focusing on the consequences of this international situation, the research analyses the potential variables that might foster academic achievement within e-learning environments. Specifically, the study builds upon and goes beyond the existing literature, developing a model that takes into consideration six variables that include students as well as instructors' perspective, along with the institutional endowments, and elearning environments. Based on the results, the study proposes policies and recommendations that might further enhance the efficiency and efficacy of e-learning environments. The present research focuses on how to enhance students' e-learning experiences and academic achievement and evaluates the type of e-learning strategies and policies that will provide a more positive effect on students, within the present and post-pandemic context. Recent studies have explored the role of platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom and Moodle on academic achievement during the Covid-19 pandemic [1] . Other recent studies address the potential relation between motivation and academic achievement in e-learning [2] , e-learning readiness and academic achievement [3] , and students' attitudes and academic achievement in e-learning [4] . One of the limitations of these studies that the present research attempts to address, resides in their individualized study of potential variables that affect academic achievement withing complex e-learning environments.",

Nevertheless, we should understand the great differences between a well-planned online program and a quick fix to continue providing education. Institutions across the world are trying to draw conclusions about this online transfer process to better prepare for future educational frameworks. We could reach biased conclusions when analysing and comparing face-to-face learning with this emergency online experience. This could happen both directions. As an example, above average grades during this period might be presented as an endorsement of online education or as a lack of the proper supervision means during assessment periods. Instructors and students feedback related to their experience during the current times should provide the first component for further analysis and enhancement of online, as well as face-to-face teaching.",

This might be due to a proper strategic planning process, which was not able to take place during the abrupt pandemic transition from in-person learning to e-learning. Study suggest that proper planning grants the opportunity to individualize materials and strategies [12] . This allows to increase student's engagement and digital readiness, providing a positive effect on student's academic achievements. Technological advancements in hardware, network capacity, software and audio and video communication applications and protocols foster e-learning experiences, students' academic engagement and the implementation of new e-learning strategies [13] . Furthermore, the extended e-learning environment, such as e-learning platforms, online chats, virtual environments that simulate class scenarios, tools to share student screens and the recent capacities added to create private rooms within the e-learning classes, allow to implement inperson teaching strategies such as group cases, students presentations and a more immersive learning experience. All these newly available tools should enhance students' academic engagements and achievements although the literature review reflects contradictory results on the effect of e-learning on the students' engagement and academic achievement, students experience a higher level of satisfaction when engaged in e-learning [14] . A recent study reports a reduction in dropout rates and an increase in students grade point average (GDP) [15] , while another study addressing similar phenomenon research results indicate an increase in criticalthinking skills for students involved in e-learning [16] . While these results are encouraging, a broader literature review also addresses the null or even negative relation between GPA and elearning teaching [17] , and the use of technology in the classroom and GPA [18] .",

There is a considerable lack of studies on e-learning for this area of the world, compared to Europe, North America, and other Asian countries such as China, India, and Japan. This research first contribution aims to help narrowing this gap. The present study second contribution aims at providing insight on the students e-learning experiences during this pandemic period. The research evaluates students' academic engagement, and digital background to implement policies and strategies that will preserve and foster students' academic achievements. The third contribution of the study consist in including within the model the perspective of the instructor, based on the results of a recent research adapted to the present model as Instructor\u00b4s Attitude [23] . The fourth and final contribution of the study is the inclusion of the latent variable E-learning environment [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

Following Researchers proposed future lines of research, the present study evaluates the mediation role of Academic Engagement, expands previous models integrating variables related to instructors, applies the model to a specific cultural context to evaluate its ability for being generalized, and examines the results taking into consideration the present pandemic framework [8] . The discussion section contrasts previous findings with the present results and proposes policies to enrich elearning environments. A recent study examined students 'attitudes to assess their experience of the e-learning system during the first few weeks of the compulsory shift to online learning in the UAE during the Covid-19 pandemic [60] . Their results indicated that the e-learning system is effective in terms of saving cost, time, and safety, during the period of the COVID-19 virus outbreak, while the negative results of the e-learning system included problems related to technology and insufficient technical support from teachers. These problems might have a direct effect on two variables under consideration in the present study, digital readiness, and instructor attitude. Another recent study investigated students' attitudes towards e-learning and virtual classes during the COVID-19 pandemic period [61] . The results established a statistically significant difference in students' attitudes towards the e-learning system and the level of students' satisfaction with the educational level of distance education [61] . As reflected in the literature review [13, 47] , instructors' attitudes towards e-learning have a direct positive relation with student motivation. The present study new findings build upon these results by identifying the positive relation between instructors' attitudes and students e-learning attitudes, as well as on instructor attitudes and students' academic achievement. A recent study reinforces the relationship between attitude and engagement of students [8] . The following study [8] also proposed lines of research, the present study tested and observed the potential mediation effects of Academic engagement on Academic achievement. Academic engagement represents a mediator between student attitudes and academic achievement, as well as between student readiness and academic achievement. Academic engagement might play this role, if the transition of class activities to e-learning maintains a meaningful content and the activities are adapted to the new context [34] . The results on the positive relation between students' readiness and academic engagement, as well as engagement and achievement confirm the proposals of the literature review [12, 13] . The study further explores along the next lines, the present findings and relates them to previous studies within the literature review, as well as it proposes on the following section, actions that might enhance academic engagement to foster academic achievement.",

Moreover, it might be recommended fostering students' participation in academic activities when designing the E-learning Environment, since the relationship between the Elearning system and students' Academic Achievement develops through academic participation. Consequently, it is relevant for the university to focus on supporting the E-learning process and community building to ensure that students have intensive training and experiences in using e-learning [62, 63] .",
