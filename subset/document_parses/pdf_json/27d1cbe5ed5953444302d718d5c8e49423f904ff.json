Currently, a number of risk factors have been identified to have a potential impact on increasing the morbidity of COVID-19 in adults, including old age, male sex, pre-existing comorbidities, and racial/ethnic disparities. In addition to these factors, changes in laboratory indices and pro-inflammatory cytokines, as well as possible complications, could indicate the progression of COVID-19 into a severe and critical stage. Children predominantly suffer from mild illnesses due to COVID-19. Similar to adults, the main risk factors in pediatric patients include age and pre-existing comorbidities. In contrast, supplementation with a healthy diet and sufficient nutrition, COVID-19 vaccination, and atopic conditions may act as protective factors against the infection of SARS-CoV-2. COVID-19 vaccination not only protects vulnerable individuals from SARS-CoV-2 infection, more importantly, it may also reduce the development of severe disease and death due to COVID-19. Currently used therapies for COVID-19 are off-label and empiric, and their impacts on the severity and mortality of COVID-19 are still unclear. The interaction between asthma and COVID-19 may be bidirectional and needs to be clarified in more studies. In this review, we highlight the clinical evidence supporting the rationale for the risk and protective factors for the morbidity, severity, and mortality of COVID-19.",

As of December 19, 2021, COVID-19 has affected more than 273 million people and has led to the death of over 5.3 million [1] . SARS-CoV-2 infection may remain asymptomatic in the early stages, until the emergence of severe pneumonia, dyspnea, organ dysfunction, and even death [2] . Although all ages can be affected, the infection has a lower clinical impact on children than on adults. Most infected children appear to have a milder course and better clinical outcomes. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolved, infections, hospitalizations, and deaths have varied among and within countries and regions worldwide, prompting questions about risk and protective factors for COVID-19.",

Based on current evidence, risk factors for developing COVID-19 in adults range from demographic factors, such as older age, male sex, and ethnicity, to the presence of underlying diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) [3] . Similarly, it has been reported that younger children and specific comorbidities such as obesity are at higher risk for infection and potentially more severe consequences of COVID-19 [4] [5] [6] [7] . In addition to these factors, the major risk factors for the severity and mortality of COVID-19 also include laboratory indices, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, and complications [8] [9] [10] [11] . In contrast, healthy diet/ nutrition, COVID-19 vaccine, and atopic conditions may protect us from the disease and avoid progression and poor clinical outcome [12] [13] [14] (Fig. 1) . The role of current therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 and asthma is still under debate. Important questions remain regarding the underlying mechanisms. In this review, we summarize the current information on the risk factors and protective factors for morbidity and severity/mortality of COVID-19 in adults and children. The correlations and potential mechanisms of risk factors and protective factors against COVID-19 in adults and children are summarized in Tables 1 and 2 .",

A meta-analysis of 59 studies comprising 36,470 patients showed that men had a higher risk of infection, disease severity, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and death than women. Overall, men had a statistically significant 8% higher risk of being diagnosed with COVID-19 than women (RR: 1.08, 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.12) [16] . In another study, among 4,880 patients with respiratory symptoms or close contact with COVID-19 patients, 1,875 (38%) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and the positive percentage was 40.43% in men, significantly higher than that in women (36.71%) [39] . It has been suggested that compared to female sex, the different effects of hormones in inflammatory processes, differences in levels of cell receptors (angiotensin-converting enzyme, ACE2) and molecules that facilitate SARS-CoV-2 entry through virus-cell membrane fusion (transmembrane protease serine 2, TMPRSS2), and lifestyle differences (such as smoking) in males may account for the predisposition of males to COVID-19 infection [8] . [42] also reported that 51% (50/99) of COVID-19 patients in their cohort had comorbidities, including cardiovascular or cerebrovascular diseases (40.4%), diabetes (12%), digestive system diseases (11%), and malignant tumors (0.01%).",

The American Heart Association's COVID-19 Cardiovascular Disease Registry study [51] recently reported that Hispanic and Black patients accounted for more than half of patients hospitalized with COVID-19, and the Black and Hispanic patients represented more than half of all in-hospital deaths, indicating that these populations are more likely to be hospitalized with SARS-CoV-2 infection and therefore bear a disproportionate burden of COVID-19 mortality. In addition, Asian patients had a higher probability of experiencing greater COVID-19 cardiorespiratory disease severity than non-Hispanic White patients [51] . The disparities in the susceptibility and mortality of COVID-19 in different races/ethnicities may be caused by the representation of the essential workforce services, poverty, access to healthcare, and insurance, which may increase the potential exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and community transmission and delay the time from symptom onset to hospitalization for individuals other than the non-Hispanic White population [22] .",

The re-use of PPE or inadequate PPE may account for the subsequent increased risk of COVID-19 in frontline HCWs [55] . In contrast, a large retrospective cohort study investigated the proportions of infection, hospitalization, and ICU admission due to COVID-19 in 72,909 individuals and found that there was no significant difference in the odds of having a positive COVID-19 test between HCWs and non-HCWs. Moreover, HCWs had lower odds of subsequent hospitalization.

One of its most important functions is the downregulation of proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [23] . A recent study [59] demonstrated that serum levels of 25-OHvitamin D were lower in severe COVID-19 patients than in mild patients and in non-infected controls, suggesting that vitamin D insufficiency may favor SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 progression to critical illness. Moreover, vitamin D level was inversely correlated with the clinical outcomes of COVID-19, independent of inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-6 and C-reactive protein [CRP]), age, or the presence of major comorbidities such as obesity, diabetes, and hypertension. This conclusion is in line with those of previous studies [60, 61] . Conversely, vitamin D supplementation may reduce the risk of infection and death from infectious disease, and adequate vitamin D levels may help in protecting the respiratory epithelium from pathogenic invasion, thereby decreasing the risk of infection [12] . Vitamin C also has an immunomodulatory effect by reducing the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-\u03b1) and increasing the levels of anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10). A case study reported that a patient with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was successfully weaned from mechanical ventilation after 5 days of treatment with high-dose vitamin C, yet antiviral medications were also administered [25] . Dietary insufficiency of vitamins and minerals has been observed in high-risk COVID-19 patients, such as the elderly, which may account for the increased risk of infection [24] . Diets with high percentages of processed food, together with a sedentary lifestyle, may increase the prevalence of hypertension and diabetes, which are risk factors for developing cardiovascular diseases, and in turn increase the risk of COVID-19 infection [62] .",

Furthermore, a trial in the USA showed that the administration of two doses of BNT162b2 or mRNA-1273 was 88.7% effective in preventing SARS-CoV-2 infection at least 36 days after the first dose [69] . Another study involving HCW and first responders in the USA showed an effectiveness of 90% in reducing RT-PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection after two doses of mRNA vaccines [70] . Theoretically, the induction of immunological memory by the COVID-19 vaccine might play an important role in the prevention of re-infections. A recent pilot study showed that much higher levels of SAR-CoV-2 S protein-specific antibodies were produced after a single dose of BNT162b2 in individuals with prior COVID-19 in the past 9-12 months, compared to those without prior infection, suggesting that vaccination can boost immune memory and prevent COVID-19 re-infection [71] .

In addition, atopy was associated with significantly lower odds and decreased duration of hospitalization for COVID-19 compared to non-atopic patients. As for the subgroups, AR and eczema patients had lower odds of COVID-19 hospitalization, and AR was associated with reduced hospitalization duration and intubation rate.

In addition, more males were in the severe group (60.8%, 95% CI: 57.2-64.2) than in the non-severe group (47.6%, 95% CI: 44.9-50.4) [78] .",

The decrease in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells may also be attributed to lymphocyte consumption during the infection process [2, 75, 94, 95] . Many studies have demonstrated that eosinopenia is more prominent in patients with severe COVID-19 than in mild patients. We have also suggested that the degree of eosinopenia may serve as a potential predictive factor for the severity of COVID-19 [96, 97] . Coagulation factors are strongly associated with disease severity or fatality. A high incidence of thromboembolic events has been reported in deceased COVID-19 patients, which may be caused by COVID-19-triggerred coagulation disorders [98] [99] [100] . In addition, prolonged PT and APTT are associated with anticoagulants, coagulation factor deficiency, and fibrinolysis. A few studies have shown shortened PT and APTT in severe COVID-19 patients [10] , while others have reported prolonged PT and APTT [101] . A recent metaanalysis found no difference in PT and APTT between the severe and non-severe groups upon admission [98] . More clinical trials are needed to investigate the relationship between PT/APTT and COVID-19 severity. In summary, monitoring the above-mentioned changes in laboratory indices will be helpful for clinicians to improve treatment regimens, prevent disease progression, and reduce the risk of death from COVID-19.",

Patients with severe COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of circulating IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-2R, and TNF-\u03b1 compared to mild-to-moderate cases [32] . As an inhibitor of the inflammatory response, IL-10 can not only prevent T-cell proliferation but also induce T-cell exhaustion in severe patients. Therefore, the elevated level of IL-10 may lead to an impaired ability to clear viral infections in severe patients due to the negative regulation of T-cell survival or proliferation [104] . Type I interferons (IFN-I) are vital for immunity against viral infections. However, coronavirus infection is considered to result in hyperinflammation induced by IFN-I [105] . Activation of IFN-I signaling pathways leads to a significant influx of neutrophils, inflammatory monocytes, macrophages, dendritic cells, and natural killer cells into the lungs. These infiltrating cells are the major source of inflammatory cytokines that trigger a cytokine storm [106] . Severe and critically ill COVID-19 patients may have impaired IFN-I activity.",

            "text": "Conflicting results have been reported regarding the association between asthma and COVID-19 susceptibility and severity. Similar to other infectious diseases affecting the lungs, asthma was once regarded as a potential risk factor for severe COVID-19 in several studies, as it is susceptible to viral-induced exacerbations [126] [127] [128] . An early case series of adults hospitalized with COVID-19 in 14 USA states reported that asthma was one of the most prevalent comorbid conditions (prevalence = 17%) [129] , and a higher asthma prevalence was observed in patients with COVID-19 in the first 393 consecutive patients with COVID-19 in New York City (prevalence = 12.5%), suggesting that asthma is more common in COVID-19 patients [91] . However, despite a few studies describing a poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients who were asthmatic, asthma has not been consistently identified as a significant comorbidity related to COVID-19. For example, the initially conducted case series from China did not specify asthma as a risk factor for severe COVID-19 [130, 131] . Instead, asthmatic patients were found to be at a reduced risk of COVID-19 hospitalization and severity in several large COVID-19 cohort studies [132, 133] . Furthermore, a recent meta-analysis including 161,271 COVID-19 patients [134] showed that asthma as a premorbid condition was present in only 1.6% of all patients, which is much lower than the prevalence of asthma in the general population worldwide [135] . These studies suggest that asthma is more likely to be a protective factor against COVID-19. These inconsistent findings may be related to the heterogeneity of asthma endotypes (allergic asthma vs. non-allergic asthma). A population-based prospective cohort study comprising 492,768 participants from the UK Biobank [131] showed a significantly higher risk of severe COVID-19 in non-allergic, but not allergic asthma patients. Another study also reported a prolonged intubation time in COVID-19 patients with non-allergic asthma, but not in those with allergic asthma [14] . Abnormal immune response occurring in the context of an allergic condition and abnormal respiratory function has been suggested as an explanation for this association [136] . The conclusion is in line with previous findings, which suggest allergic asthma may not be a risk factor for COVID-19, particularly when it is well-controlled [14, 137] . These findings suggest a potential \"protective\" role of allergic asthma, whereas non-allergic asthma predisposes patients to COVID-19.",

The limited expression of ACE2 on the target cells in asthmatic patients with COVID-19 may be caused by deficient IFN-I responses in these patients, as ACE2 is an interferon-stimulated gene in human airway epithelial cells [141] . Meanwhile, asthma with a higher allergic sensitization was found to be associated with a lower expression level of ACE2 in the nasal and bronchial epithelium, indicating a decreased risk of COVID-19 susceptibility and severity in allergic asthma patients [27] . T helper 2 (Th2)-skewed immunity may be protective against severe COVID-19 disease due to the cross-regulation between allergic and interferon-mediated immune responses [142] . Additionally, the beneficial impact of the therapeutic use of inhaled corticosteroids (ICSs) in asthmatic subjects may also contribute to the reduction in the risk of hospitalization due to COVID-19 [143, 144] . In fact, a reduced expression of ACE2 and TMPRSS2 was observed in sputum samples from asthmatic patients treated with ICSs [145, 146] . In addition, omalizumab, a monoclonal antibody for the treatment of asthma via blocking free IgE, can downregulate high-affinity IgE receptors on plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs), which is essential for antiviral immune responses and reducing disease exacerbation [147, 148] .",

In addition, a lower expression level of the ACE2 receptor in the nasal epithelium in children may also contribute to the decreased susceptibility to infection and severity of disease [150, 151] .

These results suggest that young children, particularly infants, may be vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. Similarly, in a large pediatric cohort study with over 36,000 pediatric cases of SARS-CoV-2 in Colorado, USA, extremes of age (either < 3 months or > 20 years old) were found to be predictive of severe COVID-19 [5] . Another retrospective cohort study including 177 pediatric and young adult COVID-19 patients from Washington, USA, also noted a bimodal distribution of patients: children < 1 year of age and young adults > 15 years of age represented the highest proportion of patients within the hospitalized and critically ill cohorts [155] . The results of other studies also supported a U-shaped gradient of severity in children diagnosed with COVID-19: young infants and older adolescents were at higher risk of severe disease [154, 156, 157] .",

Cohort studies from the UK and Mexico found no significant association between asthma and hospital admission in pediatric patients [7, 162] . In addition, in a study involving more than 19,000 COVID-19 patients who presented to the emergency department (ED) across 45 US children's hospitals, asthma was found to be associated with an increased risk of hospitalization, compared to pediatric COVID-19 patients discharged from the ED. However, asthma did not increase the risk of more severe diseases among hospitalized patients [159] . Similarly, in a Washington cohort study, although the most frequent underlying diagnosis in the overall group was asthma (35/177; 20%), the proportion of children and young adults with asthma in the hospitalized (16%) or critically ill cohort (22%) was not significantly higher than that in the non-hospitalized cohort (21%) or non-critically ill cohort (14%) [155] . The results from a cohort study by Floyd et al. showed an inverse association between pediatric asthma and COVID-19 hospitalization [163] .",

Furthermore, type 2 inflammation-induced under-expression of ACE2 receptor and increased TMPRSS2 expression in nasal and bronchial epithelial cells in children with type 2 rhinitis and asthma may also contribute to the protective role of asthma and atopy against SARS-CoV-2 [27, 74] .

In adults, demographic factors such as older age, male sex, ethnicity, and pre-existing comorbidities are thought to be risk factors for disease development and severity. Laboratory indices and complications developed during hospitalization may be predictive factors for the severity and mortality of COVID-19. A healthy diet, sufficient supply of nutrition, vaccination, and atopy may be protective factors against infection and progression of the disease. The roles of several factors, such as therapeutic treatments and asthma, are currently uncertain, with conflicting results. In children, infection is generally less prevalent and severe than in adults. Younger children and pre-existing comorbidities such as obesity have a predisposition to critical illness following infection with COVID-19; thus, additional care of these populations may be required.",
