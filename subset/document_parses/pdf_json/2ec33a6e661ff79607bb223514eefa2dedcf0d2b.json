We investigated whether bedside-available indices such as the ultrasonographic changes in diaphragm thickening ratio (TR) and the tidal swing in central venous pressure (\u0394CVP) are reliable estimates of inspiratory effort, assessed as the tidal swing in esophageal pressure (\u0394Pes). Methods Prospective, observational clinical investigation in the intensive care unit of a tertiary care Hospital. Fourteen critically-ill patients were enrolled (age 64 \u00b1 7 years, BMI 29 \u00b1 4 kg/m 2 ), after 6 [3; 9] days from onset of assisted ventilation. A three-level pressure support trial was performed, at 10 (PS10), 5 (PS5) and 0 cmH 2 O (PS0). In each step, the esophageal and central venous pressure tidal swing were recorded, as well as diaphragm ultrasound.",

Pressure Support Ventilation is the assisted ventilation modality most widely used during the weaning phase [7, 8] , in which the work of breathing ventilation is shared between the ventilator and the patient [9] . Since an excessive unloading of the diaphragm may lead to the development of disuse atrophy, while an insufficient ventilator assistance may be associated vigorous spontaneous efforts and the consequent co-development of under assistance diaphragm myotrauma and self-inflicted lung injury [10, 11] , an acceptable level of muscle unloading while preserving spontaneous breathing is generally suggested as the most reasonable strategy to avoid complications and achieve a successful weaning from mechanical ventilation [12] .",

Esophageal pressure (Pes) represents the reference method for measuring the pressure generated by the respiratory muscles [14, 15] . We recently demonstrated how bedside assessment of the tidal swing in esophageal pressure (\u0394Pes) is an adequate estimate of inspiratory effort. However, such calculation requires an esophageal catheter, which is only seldom used in the everyday clinical practice [16] , and is still generally regarded as a research tool; easier, bedside-available tools for the assessment of patient effort are required for everyday clinical practice, and especially more so in a situation of unbalance between the number of severe patients admitted and shortage of ICU beds and monitoring devices [17] .",

However, limited evidence is reported as to the use of \u0394CVP to assess patient effort. Moreover, since transmission of the intrathoracic pressure to the superior vena cava may depend upon the filling state [21] , we hypothesized that the relationship between the inspiratory effort and the \u0394CVP could be affected by the value of CVP (both absolute and transmural). Diaphragm ultrasound has recently been shown a potential tool for monitoring the respiratory effort of critically ill patients [22, 23] . However, the relationship between diaphragm thickening and respiratory effort is far from being completely understood, as it may be influenced by several factors, such as the thoracoabdominal pattern of breathing and the mechanical characteristics of the respiratory system, to the extent that the degree of thickening may vary strongly between patients at a given level of diaphragm effort [24] .",

The optimal inflation volume of the balloon was obtained by means of a specific calibration procedure carried out by the OptiVent\u00ae system, which inflates the balloon to different volumes while recording the respective pressure values. CVP was measured from the distal port of a triple-lumen central venous catheter, whose distal end was located radiographically in the superior vena cava. The distal port was connected to a differential pressure transducer which was filled with a 0.9% saline solution. CVP measurements were zeroed at mid-thoracic position at the level of the fifth rib [27] , and the value was taken during either end-inspiration or end-expiration, at the base of \"c\" wave [28] . Transmural CVP was calculated as the difference between CVP and Pes [29] . \u0394CVP was recorded on a dedicated multi-parametric monitor (Carescape B850, GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, UK).",

During the last 5 min of each step, the pattern of breathing and indices of respiratory effort were assessed, diaphragm ultrasound was performed, and hemodynamic parameters were recorded. To avoid the confounding effect of the possible development of fatigue at low levels of assistance, which might have then influenced the following steps, we decided to perform a decremental pressure-support test and we did not randomize the sequence of pressure support levels. The protocol was allowed to be stopped, if patients developed signs of respiratory distress (respiratory rate > 35 breaths/min, SpO 2 < 90%, heart rate > 140 beats/min, systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg, diaphoresis or anxiety).",

Descriptive results are reported as mean (standard deviation) if normally distributed, or median [25-75th percentiles] otherwise. The analysis on the variables recorded over the three steps (PS10, PS5, PS0) was performed by analysis of variance for repeated measurements, with step as a withinsubject factor, and the statistical significance of the withinsubject factors was corrected with the Greenhouse-Geisser method.

The diagnostic performance of the CVP swing and diaphragm TR for detecting either a low or a high inspiratory effort (arbitrarily defined as an esophageal pressure swing < 5 and > 8 cmH 2 O, respectively) [10, 11] was assessed by calculating the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value. To calculate positive and negative predictive values, the prevalence of the condition in the population was assumed to be equal to the prevalence in the sample.

However, the weaning process has not been fully covered, and suggestions have been made to follow the general criteria for weaning in any type of respiratory failure. In the Lombardy region, at the peak of the emergency, more than twice the number of preexisting ICU beds were occupied by patients with severe COVID-19 [33] . Contributing to this resource scarcity is the prolonged ventilator dependence and the difficult weaning associated to prolonged prone positioning, deep sedation and use of muscle relaxants and corticosteroids [1] . Given the lack of ICU beds, many clinicians attempted weaning from mechanical ventilation, well aware of the difficult balance between the detrimental and beneficial effects of spontaneous breathing effort [12] , i.e. the potential protection against diaphragm contractile dysfunction [34, 35] and the possibility of selfinflicted lung injury from an excessive respiratory drive [36] .",

First of all, TR is insensitive to duration and frequency of contractions. Moreover, TR may differ from inspiratory effort in two directions: a low TR in the presence of a high \u0394Pes, and the opposite. The first case (high inspiratory effort, low diaphragm thickening) can arise when diaphragm dysfunction is present [40] . Less intuitive is the second condition, i.e. the coexistence of a high diaphragm thickening with a low inspiratory effort. The relationship between diaphragm thickening and pressure generation may in fact depend on the pattern of thoracoabdominal motion, so that more thickening is expected for any given \u0394Pes when the inspiration is predominantly accommodated by descent of the diaphragm rather than expansion of the ribcage. Although the thoracoabdominal pattern was not recorded in the present investigation, we can speculate that this issue might be a factor contributing to our results.",

That CVP and Pes fluctuate during ventilation in a similar way is not a new finding [44] . During positive-pressure breathing in passive conditions, tidal changes of Pes and CVP were almost identical in size, and linearly correlated [19] . Quite surprisingly, however, the use of \u0394CVP to estimate inspiratory effort has seldom been reported, and is generally not used in the everyday clinical practice. Flemale et al. measured CVP and Pes with identical fluid-filled systems in healthy volunteers during inspiratory efforts against a closed airway in seated, supine, right lateral and left lateral positions, and concluded that CVP reflects Pes, with a \u0394CVP/\u0394Pes ratio close to the unity [18] . Similar results were recently found in 10 patients undergoing progressive reduction of inspiratory pressure support, in whom the ratio of \u0394CVP to \u0394Pes was on average 1.1, with a mean difference of 1 cmH 2 O [20] . We found that \u0394CVP was an adequate estimate of inspiratory muscle force generation across a wide range of loading conditions. Potential factors which may affect the concordance between Pes and CVP include the fact that CVP is measured with a fluid-filled system, while Pes is measured with an airfilled system. While fluid-filled systems have a theoretical better frequency response, only small differences were found between the two systems [45] . Moreover, a poor transmission of the pleural pressure changes into the superior vena cava is also possible, and a reduction of the compliance of the vena cava has been suggested as a mechanism [18] . Since the filling of the superior vena cava may potentially influence its mechanical characteristics [21] , a secondary outcome of the present investigation was to investigate the effect of CVP (both as the absolute and the transmural value) on the correspondence between \u0394CVP and \u0394Pes. We found that the association between the two variables was significant independently of the value of CVP.",

Central venous pressure swing proved a specific rather than a sensitive test, both for low and high inspiratory effort: this means that it can effectively be used to rule in the specific condition with virtually no false negatives and an overall acceptable discriminative ability (i.e. a CVP swing < 5 cmH 2 O rules in a low inspiratory effort, whereas a CVP swing > 8 cmH 2 O rules in a high inspiratory effort).",

However, despite the availability of monitoring techniques (mainly used for research purposes), inspiratory effort is seldom measured directly [50] . In the current investigation we showed how the inspiratory swing of CVP, a near-ubiquitous monitoring in the ICU, can be used to track inspiratory effort with an acceptable accuracy. Since monitoring of inspiratory effort was suggested for patients at higher risk of complications from injurious breathing [10] , such as those with more severe lung injury or systemic inflammation, and patients with COVID-19-associated acute respiratory failure have a form of injury that was found similar to patients with ARDS unrelated to COVID-19 [51] , we speculate that using \u0394CVP to assess inspiratory effort may be a useful tool in other patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure.",

Moreover, patients were observed over a limited time-frame: we are unaware if and how much the results would change over time and their clinical relevance. The level of pressure support at the time of enrolment in the study was set by the clinician according to local recommendations. Indeed, it was shown how the clinical setting of pressure support often results in higher levels than needed by the patients to preserve respiratory muscle function while at the same time preventing passive lung inflation, and several physiological model based decision support systems may help in the selection of appropriate ventilator settings [53] .",

Indeed, we did not measure transdiaphragmatic pressure, which is the goldstandard measurement of the pressure-generating ability of the diaphragm. Despite the exclusion of patients with a story of COPD, intrinsic PEEP was not measured, and we cannot exclude the effect of hyperinflation on our findings. While the population included in the present study suffered from COVID-19-related acute respiratory failure and the virtual absence of any relevant comorbidity in the patients warns against direct extrapolation of our results to other groups of patients, the strong physiological basis of our findings make us speculate in favour of a possible utility of these measurements in other categories of patients. Further studies are however warranted to verify this point.",
