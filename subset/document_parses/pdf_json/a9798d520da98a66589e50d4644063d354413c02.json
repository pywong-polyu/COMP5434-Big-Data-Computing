In the traditional method, the clustering energy consumption scheduling algorithm is mainly used in the cloud resource scheduling algorithm. Combined with the priority list control method, the big data partition scheduling of time series data under the probability statistical model is carried out. In reference [4] , a time series data scheduling method based on adaptive priority list control is proposed, combined with the optimal storage and distributed retrieval model of cloud resources, the block chain slicing storage scheduling is carried out.

In reference [5] , a resource scheduling algorithm for block chain slicing storage system under the probability and statistical model of double threshold equilibrium control is proposed. The time axis of cloud resource scheduling is divided into uniformly distributed time windows, and the time series data scheduling method is combined with the block structure reorganization method, but the computational overhead of this method is large and the real-time performance is not good.",

The time series data distribution structure model under probability statistical model is constructed. The spatial multi-sensor information sampling method is used to sample the time series data information flow under the probability statistical model, and the phase space reconstruction method is combined to reconstruct the time series data information structure under the probability statistical model. The probability statistical model is established to decompose the time series data, and the distributed grid computing method is used to extract the big data association features of the time series data under the probability statistical model. Combined with the adaptive weight learning method, the optimal control of the scheduling is carried out. The big data cross-domain scheduling of the time series data under the probabilistic statistical model is realized under the support vector machine learning mode. The simulation results show that the method has good adaptability to time series data cross-domain scheduling under the probability and statistics model, and the load balance of data output is strong. The method has good application value in time series data reconstruction. However, due to the limited time, the efficiency of reconstruction of time series data needs to be improved, which is also my future research direction. ",
