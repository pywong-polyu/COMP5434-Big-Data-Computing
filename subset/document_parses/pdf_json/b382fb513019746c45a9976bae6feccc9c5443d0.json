However, the effectiveness of current established diet therapies is suboptimal. The patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 (PNPLA3) gene modifies disease outcome and hepatic lipid handling, but the role of PNPLA3 variants in modulating responsiveness to different diet therapies is unknown. Methods and analysis This project aims to assess the feasibility of conducting a genotype-driven randomised controlled trial (RCT) investigating the differential response to a Mediterranean diet (MD) intervention of NAFLD patients according to genotype for the rs738409 (I148M) variant of PNPLA3. A single-centre randomised controlled feasibility trial will be undertaken. We will recruit 60 adults with NAFLD from a tertiary hepatology centre in England. In a cross-over design, participants will undertake Diet 1 (MD) and Diet 2 (control) for 4 weeks, in random order (1:1 allocation), separated by a 4 weeks washout period. Participants will complete one-to-one diet and lifestyle consultations at baseline, end of diet phase 1, end of washout and end of diet phase 2. Participants will be advised to maintain baseline levels of physical activity and body weight. The primary outcome is the acceptability and feasibility of the intervention protocol. Secondary outcomes include exploratory assessment of liver fibrosis biomarkers and lipid biomarkers. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval was granted by East of Scotland Research Ethics Service REC 1 (19/ ES/0112). Results will be disseminated through peerreviewed journals and presented at local, national and international meetings and conferences. The findings of this trial will lay the foundation for a future definitive RCT by informing trial design and optimising the intervention diets, instruments and procedures.

[11] [12] [13] The PNPLA3 protein has lipase activity and regulates lipid droplets in hepatocytes and hepatic stellate cells. 14 Several studies have contributed to understanding of its function in hepatic lipid handling. 15 Numerous genomewide association studies have shown its association with the entire disease spectrum, which has been confirmed in various populations. 8 12 16 17 Therefore, among the identified NAFLD-related genes, PNPLA3 has the most potential as a therapeutic target for NAFLD. 10 12 The main treatment recommendations for NAFLD are lifestyle interventions targeting weight loss and improved dietary patterns. 4 5 The Mediterranean diet (MD) reduces steatosis, improves liver biochemistry and cardiometabolic dysfunction, with or without weight loss and is the most recommended dietary pattern in NAFLD. 5 18-23 There is strong and consistent evidence that the MD, has beneficial effects on NAFLD-associated conditions such as type 2 diabetes and the metabolic syndrome. 24 However, there is suboptimal response to current diet therapies in NAFLD and more effective approaches for enhancing adherence to diet therapies are needed. 11 Personalised nutrition approaches that use information on individual participant characteristics to tailor the dietary intervention may improve the suboptimal response to current diet therapies. 25 Differences in gene sequence can alter the activity of encoded proteins and affect the response of individuals to dietary components. 26 Emergent research has shown nutritional regulation of PNPLA3 15 26 so that patients with NAFLD carrying the PNPLA3 risk allele might benefit more from weight loss but less from omega-3 supplementation. [26] [27] [28] [29] Diet lifestyle modification is more effective in decreasing liver steatosis in PNPLA3 I148M carriers than in non-carriers. 29 30 Liver fat content is influenced by the interaction between PNPLA3 variants and high carbohydrate intake, specifically sugar. 31 A hypocaloric low-carbohydrate diet induced greater hepatic fat reduction in carriers homozygous for the rs738409 G allele in the PNPLA3 gene compared with carriers of the rs738409 C allele, irrespective of weight loss. 32 However, the role of PNPLA3 variants in influencing responsiveness to different diet therapies is poorly understood.",

            "text": "The main strength of this trial is the use of explicit feasibility and acceptability criteria as primary outcomes. Patient-reported outcome measures and open-response questions will be especially important to identify impact of diet treatments and trial procedures on quality of life and individuals' perceptions of trial participation. In addition, the use of a cross-over design will facilitate more precise comparisons between intervention/control diets on a within-participant basis. 57 This design is favoured in short-term trials of long-term conditions with intermediate outcomes. 57 Nevertheless, a limitation of this design is the possibility of carryover effects from one experimental period to the next. We have addressed this issue by including a 4-week washout period. The required duration of washout period is influenced by the nature and duration of the intervention but, in nutritional cross-over studies, 2-4 weeks is often sufficient. 58 59 This is confirmed by studies of metabolomics biomarkers in urine which show that these respond rapidly to dietary change. 60 Importantly, we will evaluate the effectiveness of washout to return outcome variables to baseline. Additionally, participants will be supplied with intervention foods and counselled to return to habitual dietary intake during washout. Advice will be given to maintain baseline levels of physical activity and body weight (\u00b13%) throughout. The intervention period (4 weeks) is relatively short and is unlikely to reveal the full effects of the dietary intervention on markers of liver health. Previous research has found that brief and short-term interventions effectively modified MD adoption and maintenance up to 12 months in non-Mediterranean countries 39 61-63 and that, with appropriate support, dietary change can be sustained for up to 4 years in Spain. 64 However, this study is designed, primarily, to provide information on the acceptability and feasibility of the study protocol. Finally, the MD intervention in this trial has been systematically developed and informed by research evidence and patient and public feedback. This trial will assess the feasibility of conducting a genotype-driven RCT investigating the differential response to a MD intervention of patients according to genotype for the rs738409 (I148M) variant of PNPLA3. The findings of this trial will lay the foundation for a future definitive RCT by informing trial design and optimising the intervention diets, instruments and procedures. In the longer run, the outcomes of this research programme may lead to fewer patients with NAFLD who need intensified medical treatment, reducing cost burden, and premature mortality and morbidity.",
