            "text": "Human bocavirus (HBoV) is a parvovirus recently identified in association with acute respiratory infections (ARI). Despite its worldwide occurrence, little is known on the pathogenesis of HBoV infections. In addition, few systematic studies of HBoV in ARI have been conducted in Latin America. Therefore, in order to test whether active viral replication of human bocavirus is associated with respiratory diseases and to understand the clinical impact of this virus in patients with these diseases, we performed a 3-year retrospective hospital-based study of HBoV in outpatients and inpatients with symptoms of Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) in Brazil. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 1015 patients with respiratory symptoms were tested for HBoV DNA by PCR. All samples positive for HBoV were tested by PCR for all other respiratory viruses, had HBoV viral loads determined by quantitative real time PCR and, when possible, were tested by RT-PCR for HBoV VP1 mRNA, as evidence of active viral replication. HBoV was detected in 4.8% of patients, with annual rates of 10.0%, 3.0% and 3.0% in 2005, 2006 and 2007, respectively. The range of respiratory symptoms was similar between HBoV-positive and HBoVnegative ARI patients. However, a higher rate of diarrhea was observed in HBoV-positive patients. High HBoV viral loads (.10 8 copies/mL) and diarrhea were significantly more frequent in patients with exclusive infection by HBoV and in patients with detection of HBoV VP1 mRNA than in patients with viral co-infection, detected in 72.9% of patients with HBoV. In summary, our data demonstrated that active HBoV replication was detected in a small percentage of patients with ARI and was correlated with concurrent diarrhea and lack of other viral co-infections.",

HBoV is classified in the family Parvoviridae, which includes small non-enveloped, icosahedral viruses with 5.3 kb single-stranded DNA genome containing three open reading frames (ORFs). The first two sequential ORFs encode non-structural proteins NS1 and NP-1, whereas the third downstream ORF encodes two viral capsid proteins, VP1 and VP2 [1] . HBoV circulates worldwide [2] and more recent phylogenetic analyses revealed that three novel HBoV species, different from the respiratory HBoV1, named HBoV2, 3 and 4, are frequently detected in stools from children with acute gastroenteritis [3, 4, 5, 6] .",

In order to confirm this hypothesis, an assay was developed to detect HBoV VP1 mRNA in NPAs by real time RT-PCR done on total RNA extracts previously treated with DNAse I. As an internal control, real time RT-PCR was done for the housekeeping gene of b-actin. When simultaneously positive for both HBoV VP1 and bactin mRNAs, this assay was considered a marker of active HBoV replication. Positivity for HBoV VP1 or b-actin by PCR done directly on DNAse-treated material without previous reverse transcription were considered indicative of remaining genomic DNA after incomplete DNAse treatment, and samples were discarded. Of the 48 samples positive for HBoV, 40 had sufficient remaining volume left for testing. Of those, only 10 (25.0%) tested positive for VP1 mRNA and, remarkably, 9 of these had very high HBoV loads of greater than 10 8 copies of DNA/mL. The median HBoV viral load in patients shedding VP1 mRNA was 8.85 6 10 9 copies/mL, which was significantly higher than that in patients negative for VP1 HBoV mRNA, 3.82 610 5 copies/mL (p,0.01) (Figure 2b , Table 3 ).

A few previous studies conducted in the region reported HBoV infection rates of 6.0% to 10.7% in patients with ARI [9, 25, 26, 27] and in 2.0% of patients with gastroenteritis [15] . Importantly, the present study revealed a significantly higher rate of concurrent diarrhea in patients with ARI positive for HBoV as compared to those with ARI but without detectable HBoV, suggesting a causative role for HBoV in gastrointestinal manifestations observed in ARI patients. In general, parvoviruses replicate more efficiently in tissues with high cellular turnover, such as respiratory and digestive epithelia [28] . Several members of the family Parvoviridae are known to cause gastroenteritis, such as canine parvovirus (CPV), feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) and canine minute virus (CnMV). In addition studies previously published by others have reported HBoV detection in stools from patients with gastroenteritis [29] . Although the mechanisms of pathogenesis and routes of infection of HBoV are not yet understood, some information is available for bovine parvovirus (BPV), another member of the genus Bocavirus. BPV causes respiratory and enteric diseases in calves following initial replication in the tonsils and intestinal epithelium, from where it spreads into the blood, lymphoid tissues and respiratory epithelium. BPV induces atrophy of microvilli in the small intestine and death (by apoptosis and necrosis) of lymphoid cells and ciliated cells of the respiratory epithelium [28] .",

This was similar to the 75% reported by Allander et al., in Sweden [10] , and higher than the 50% reported by Esposito et al., in Italy [34] . While viral co-infections have long been recognized in ARI studies, the advent of highly sensitive PCR assays magnified their observation. In the particular case of HBoV, frequencies of co-infections have consistently been reported to be higher than those observed for other respiratory infections, reaching rates similar to those reported for HAdV [35] , a tendency confirmed by the present study. Yet unproven, this may suggest that long term shedding of HBoV DNA, unrelated to current illness may regularly occur, as it is known to happen with HAdV [36] .

The results revealed HBoV viral loads to be significantly higher in patients without other viral co-infections than in those with multiple viruses detected. Moreover, rates of diarrhea were significantly higher in patients with very high HBoV viral loads in their NPAs. Such finding, in the absence of respiratory viral coinfections, suggests a causal role for HBoV in the genesis of the diseases presented by these patients. Nevertheless, detection of a direct evidence of active replication of HBoV in the secretions from patients was required to strengthen the causality link between the virus and disease. In order to do that, an assay to detect HBoV VP1 mRNA by real time RT-PCR in nasopharyngeal samples was developed. Production of VP1 mRNA is unequivocal evidence of HBoV replication, but its shedding in nasopharyngeal secretions does not indicate the possible sources of virus production. Because RNA is very highly unstable in ribonuclease-rich respiratory secretions, one can speculate that VP1 mRNA more likely originates from disruption of sloughed whole HBoV-infected epithelial cells directly into the RNaseinhibiting extraction reagent. Unfortunately, preparation of cytology slides that would have enabled detection of HBoV on sloughed cells by in situ hybridization was not possible given the nature of the study.",

Conversely, in the absence of a marker of current viral replication, HBoV was also often detected in nasopharyngeal secretions, but in much lower viral loads and frequently associated with shedding of other pathogenic respiratory viruses. It should be pointed out that VP1 mRNA was found only in 25% of the HBoV infected ARI patients, with a significant part of whom with diarrhea. This may be interpreted to mean that only one quarter of the HBoV respiratory infections are associated with genuinely acute viral replication, likely involving the gastrointestinal tract. Conversely, in most cases of HBoV detection in respiratory secretions, it may be the result of viral persistence/latency, with co-detection of another viral agent. ",

The study included all samples from patients with symptoms of ARI seen at any of the hospital clinics and wards, submitted to the virology laboratory for testing. The vast majority of the samples had been originally sent to the laboratory for respiratory syncytial virus and influenza screening and no exclusion criteria were applied. Clinical information obtained retrospectively from patient records upon discharge was entered on study forms. Clinical data collected included the presence of wheezing, cough, fever, sneezing, dyspnea, coryza, nasal obstruction, diarrhea, requirement for oxygen therapy and length of hospitalization. NPAs were collected in saline solution from all patients [9] and sent on ice to the virology laboratory within four hours. In addition to the 1015 samples from ARI patients, a convenience set of 50 control samples from patients without any respiratory symptoms who were participants in a previous study [23] were used as negative controls. This group consisted of 26 males, with median age of 19.5 months, mean of 37 months (SD = 44 months). After routine virology sample processing, remaining samples were split into backup aliquots, including two in Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA), which were kept in storage at 270uC [9] .

For detection of HBoV and human adenovirus (HAdV), 100 ng of extracted DNA was used, whereas for other respiratory viruses, including human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV), human metapneumovirus (HMPV), human rhinovirus (HRV), human influenza virus (FLU), human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) and human coronaviruses (HCoV), PCR was done with cDNA generated by reverse transcription (RT) of 1 mg of RNA, primed with 10 pmol of random hexamers, using ImProm-II Reverse Transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI) following manufacturer's instructions. Prior to reverse transcription, RNA was denatured at 95uC for 5 minutes, then immediately placed on ice while reverse transcriptase was added and then incubated at 42uC for 2 hours. PCR was done with150 ng of DNA, 10 pmol forward and reverse primers (Table S1 ), 50 mM MgCL 2 , 10 mM deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP), 2.5 mL of supplied 10 X buffer, 1U of Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA) and water to complete the volume of 25 mL. The cycling conditions were denaturation at 95uC for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94uC for 1 min, 48uC to 54uC for 1 min, 72uC for 2 min, and then a final extension step of 72uC for 10 min [9] . All PCR products were analyzed by electrophoresis in ethidium bromide-stained 1.5% agarose gels. PCR products of all tested viruses were cloned into the plasmid pGEM-T easy (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin) and used to determine detection limits for each assay. All clones were sequenced with BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA) using the ABI Prism 3100 Genetic Analyzer. The detection limits for the PCR assays were determined by testing serial decimal dilutions of the clones, and results varied from 1 to 100 copies of plasmid DNA. The limit of detection for HBoV was determined to be 40 copies. All applicable measures to prevent contamination of PCR reactions were taken in this study.",

A positive qPCR for HBoV was considered when the threshold was reached before the 40 th cycle with fluorescence count higher than 0.5. The detection limit was 4.6 copies of HBoV plasmid, the slope and the R2 of the standard curve were 23,386 and 0,994, respectively. All qPCR results were normalized by the amplification of the b-actin gene, included in duplicate in all tested batches, using 300 nmol/L of each primer and 150 nmol/L of the probe (Table S1 ).

To ensure target-specific amplification total RNA extraction products were treated with DNAse I (Invitrogen Carlsbad, CA) 2 h prior to PCR. As a control, the same PCR was done in parallel directly with the RNA extraction product without previous RT. Samples were considered positive for HBoV VP1 mRNA only when they were simultaneously negative for amplification directly from the extracted RNA without previous RT. RT was performed on 1 mg of RNA extracted by Trizol using10 pmol of random primers, according to the protocol provided by the manufacturer. After RNA denaturation at 95uC for 5 min reverse transcriptase was added and incubation went on for 2 h at 42uC. PCR was then carried out with 150 ng of cDNA, with 300 nmol/L of each primer (VP1-F and VP2-R), 150 nmol/L of the probe (VP1-S, Table S1), and 5 mL of TaqMan universal PCR master mix (Applied Biosystems Foster City, CA).

As above mentioned, positive reactions were considered when the threshold was reached before the 40 th cycle, with a fluorescence higher than 0.5. The detection limit of this assay was found to be 3 copies of DNA, as determined using the decimal serial dilutions of viral cDNA obtained from in vitro transcription of a plasmid containing theVP1 gene, according to manufactures' instructions (Riboprobe in vitro transcription systems, Promega Madison, WI).",
