Methods Results of all real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests for SARS-CoV-2 performed at our radio-oncology department between 13 October 2020 and 11 March 2021 were included. Clinical data and anamnestic information at the time of testing were documented and examined for (i) the presence of COVID-19-related symptoms and (ii) virus-related anamnesis (high-risk [prior positive test or contact to a positive tested person within the last 14 days] or low-risk [inconspicuous anamnesis within the last 14 days]). Results A total of 1056 SARS-CoV-2 tests in 543 patients were analyzed. Of those, 1015 tests were performed in asymptomatic patients and 41 tests in patients with COVID-19-associated symptoms. Two of 940 (0.2%) tests in asymptomatic patients with low-risk anamnesis and three of 75 (4.0%) tests in asymptomatic patients with high-risk anamnesis showed a positive result. For symptomatic patients, SARS-CoV-2 was detected in three of 36 (8.3%) low-risk and three of five (60.0%) high-risk tests. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the correlation between individual risk factors and positivity rates of SARS-CoV-2 tests in cancer patients. The data demonstrate that clinical and anamnestic assessment is a simple and effective measure to distinctly increase SARS-CoV-2 test efficiency. This might enable cancer centers to adjust test strategies in asymptomatic patients, especially when test resources are scarce.",

            "text": "The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 has changed the world. Until May 2021, more than 3.4 million people around the globe died of the disease caused by the virus, called COVID-19 [1] . The infection is most harmful in the elderly population, but also in younger individuals with comorbidities. Cancer patients, particularly those under therapy, are suspected to be at higher risk for severe COVID-19 [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . This has led to immense efforts in cancer centers to prevent the spread of the infection within departments [7, 8] . One strategy might be the testing of asymptomatic patients before and during anticancer treatment to detect unrecognized carriers [9] . This has been recommended in guidelines by scientific organizations such as the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) [10] . Yet, evidence about the impact of systematic testing in asymptomatic cancer patients is lacking [11, 12] . For radiation oncology K departments, regular screening of asymptomatic patients is resource consuming because radiotherapy regimens frequently have to be provided over a period of up to 2 months [13] . Hence, there is a clear need for efficient test strategies to manage the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; the end of which cannot be foreseen [14, 15] . In this study, we report the results of testing asymptomatic as well as symptomatic cancer patients for SARS-CoV-2 at the Radiation Oncology Department of the University Hospital Frankfurt, Germany, during the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic in autumn/winter 2020/2021. In addition, anamnestic information at the time of testing was assessed to evaluate possible improvements of test efficiency.",

The rational first step of risk stratification should clearly be the clinical assessment of patients. Unsurprisingly, in our study, positivity rates of patients classified as symptomatic were much higher than in the asymptomatic cohort and the utility of testing symptomatic patients is unquestionable. Nevertheless, our data reveal that risk stratification by virus-related anamnesis might increase test efficiency, also in asymptomatic patients, by a multiple. The positivity rate in asymptomatic patients with highrisk anamnesis, was much higher than in the asymptomatic low-risk cohort. Plus, only a fraction of the total test count was performed in the high-risk cohort. This highlights the usefulness of a simple daily assessment of virus-related anamnesis and suspicious symptoms and could enable care providers to select patients efficiently before testing, especially when test capacities are confined. The reverse is also true: conducting consequent, daily anamnesis can trigger rational, well-chosen tests. This might be a crucial instrument to detect asymptomatic carriers and to improve avoidance of uncontrolled viral spread.",

In fact, most of our outpatients were only tested once, before treatment initiation. However, not a single transmission within our center was observed (the formation of an asymptomatic cluster does not seem probable). This indicates that the consistent execution of general safety/hygienic ensured feasibility and safety of anticancer treatment in our department. Hence, especially in outpatient settings, the presented risk stratification by clinical and anamnestic assessment could be of great help, allowing the test strategy to be adjusted rationally to save resources but without compromising the safety of treatments.",

The most obvious limitations of this study are the retrospective design and the restriction to a single center patient cohort. To validate our classification system of low-risk and highrisk anamnesis, prospective (multicentric) trials would have to be conducted. Even though RT-PCR is established as gold standard for the detection of SARS-CoV-2, falsenegative results are a potential source of error [31] . Ongoing mutations of SARS-CoV-2 that lead to divergent pathogenic attributes might complicate the transferability of the present data to future scenarios [32] . Moreover, the presented data have to be utilized carefully, since the results and consequences for clinical practice are highly dependent on overall incidence, societal resources and general politics.",
