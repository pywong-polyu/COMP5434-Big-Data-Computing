We divided the CoV genome into 29 constituent regions and applied novel analytical approaches to identify associations between CoV genomic features and epidemiological metadata. Our results show that nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) and Spike protein (S) have the highest variation and greatest correlation with the viral whole-genome variation. S protein variation is correlated with nsp3, nsp6, and 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease variation. Country of origin and time since the start of the pandemic were the most influential metadata associated with genomic variation, while host sex and age were the least influential. We define a novel statistic-coherence-and show its utility in identifying geographic regions (populations) with unusually high (many new variants) or low (isolated) viral phylogenetic diversity. Interestingly, at both global and regional scales, we identify geographic locations with high coherence neighboring regions of low coherence; this emphasizes the utility of this metric to inform public health measures for disease spread. Our results provide a direction to prioritize genes associated with outcome predictors (e.g., health, therapeutic, and vaccine outcomes) and to improve DNA tests for predicting disease status.",

More than a year later, there are a diversity of efforts ongoing to develop both therapeutic strategies as well as vaccine distribution. Yet, we know from experience, the virus will evolve strategies to escape both host immune systems and intervention strategies. Characterizing the dynamics of coronavirus genomic variation is crucial to understand both viral (e.g., virulence) and host (e.g., immune response) biological activities related to these changes, which makes the coronavirus (CoV) genome the most important and most challenging source to investigate the virus behavior. For example, the viral Spike protein is considered a key element of the virus to initiate binding to host cells via cell-surface protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) 1,2 ; hence, ACE2 genetic variation has been targeted as a source to explain disease severity [3] [4] [5] . Genomic variation has also been shown to be informative in terms of tracking the spread of the virus 6 and identifying major clades related to different variants of SARS-CoV-2 with different epidemiological features 7 . CoV genomic variation has also been associated with host phenotypic variables (including epidemiological information) via changes in the virus protein structure, giving the latter great potential explanatory power with respect to clinical outcomes [8] [9] [10] . Population-level studies of protein structural changes in CoV genomes may likewise inform its epidemic kinetics (e.g., speed of spread). However, our ability to effectively link genomic variation in viruses to epidemiological information is hindered by analytical limitations in current methodologies to test such associations. Here we apply our novel multi-resolution clustering approach for identifying variable CoV genomic regions and linking these regions to epidemiological factors. We apply a coherence metric to quantify and compare phylogenetic divergence of CoV genomes within locations to the divergence of CoV between locations. Our results have direct public health applicability, and the underlying methodology is robust to any collection of genomic features and epidemiological data.",

We used two sets of data: one to investigate SARS-CoV-2 differences against previously detected coronaviruses at the nucleotide and protein level, and another including only SARS-CoV-2 genomes to characterize the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic in association with epidemiological data. We generated dissimilarity matrices between the whole viral genome and specific regions, and applied omeClust 11 (\"Methods\"), a multi-resolution clustering approach to investigate viral lineage diversity in relation to clinical and epidemiological data. We also used the nucleotidebased distance structure among samples to assess the relationship between variation explained by the whole genome and specific regions. Using this approach, we identified novel associations between the spike protein and nsp3 and the whole genome variation within the SARS-CoV-2 and among lineages of other coronaviruses. Further, we found that epidemiological variables such as country of origin and days from the start of the pandemic explain most of the genomic variation. Our results show that host, infected individuals, gender, and age have the lowest explanatory power of the viral genomic variation. This suggests that the viral genome mutations are independent of those specific characteristics of the infected hosts. In addition, the specific gene differences among the coronavirus families drive most of the genome differences, which can explain the speed of spread and higher infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.",

We used phylodynamic techniques to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of COVID-19. We first investigated the detailed genomic variation among coronaviruses to identify important changes at specific regions (i.e., protein and single nucleotide polymorphisms) in relation to epidemiological variables. We hypothesized that distinct genomic, population and phylogeographic signatures in SARS-CoV-2 circulate during different phases of the epidemic. We used a comprehensive collection of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes isolated from COVID-19 patients and accompanying epidemiological data identified within the GISAID database 13 . As a separate analysis, we coupled SARS-CoV-2 genomic sequences from GISAID with other complete coronavirus genomes from GenBank (\"Methods\").",

We found that SARS-CoV-2, SARS-related, and MERS-CoV comprise distinct clades, with a SARS-related plus bat clade sister to SARS-CoV-2. Two groups of Bat-SL-CoV taxa were sister to MERS-CoV and interspersed with the SARS-related clade. The homology-based distance of the viral genome has been used to distinguish the clades using the omeClust approach. CoV subclades, diversity, and gene signal. To investigate the influence of the CoV genes in the phylogenetic trees, we applied omeClust to the inter-sample distances of 29 regions and CoV genomes from the GISAID SARS-CoV-2 alignment. We identified communities of CoV lineages by applying omeClust (\"Methods\") to a distance matrix built from dissimilarity among genome alignments. Distance matrices were calculated for genome and gene partitions using GTR + G distances 15, 16 . These distances are used as inputs into the omeClust algorithm along with clinical data including organism, date (year), and country. The correlation between CoV lineage communities and metadata reported by omeClust as enrichment score using normalized mutual information for all CoV genes is shown (Fig. 2a) . Results show that variation in distance matrices for the genomes and specific regions is explained by metadata and the Spike protein and nsp3 regions correlate with the viral genome overall. Identified clades of CoV using genome variation (Fig. 2b) are explained mostly by organisms (NMI = 0.9). Date (NMI = 0.62) and country (NMI = 0.41) also have some influence in the clade structure. omeClust results identified clades and organisms as the most influential metadata and suggest that the major variation among coronavirus organisms happens in the Spike (Fig. 2c ) and nsp3 proteins (Fig. 2d) . omeClust gives similar enrichment scores for the whole genome, and the Spike protein and nsp3 region. However, regions such as E, nsp10, and M have different specifications and separation properties. In omeClust analysis, we used five distinguished organisms (\"Methods\").",

We defined a 'coherence' measurement to quantify the similarity of lineages within a location (countries or states) compared to other locations (\"Methods\"). Countries with greater coherence show greater similarity and less phylogenetic separation of lineages (Fig. 5) . The coherence can be used as a measurement of diversity and spatiotemporal distributions of SARS-CoV-2 lineages in a region of interest. A coherence score of 1.0, like in Qatar, indicates that viral lineages in Qatar are more similar to each other compared to the rest of the world. Brunei, Algeria, Kuwait, Uruguay, Egypt, and Japan follow behind Qatar, with coherence scores greater than 0.5. A high within-community diversity is indicated by a low coherence score such as Malaysia (coherence = \u2212 0.45). A natural extension for this metric is in the realm of public health, where coherence can be used as a surrogate for assessing the effectiveness of policies such as the use of face coverings 20 and/or travel restrictions 21 (Fig. 5b) . .

Spike protein variation was significantly correlated with nsp3 (coefficient = 0.20); here, we show a similar pattern for nsp3 in predicted protein structure, where SARS-related and SARS-CoV-2 have similar nsp3 secondary structures, as well as Bat-SL-CoV and MERS-CoV, which also have similar nsp3 secondary structures. We used proteins that have a high correlation with genome variation, Spike protein, and nsp3 protein, and four proteins with lower variation, including N, ORF6, 2\u2032 O Ribose Methyltransferase proteins.

Different secondary structures show different robustness to mutations; in this context, robustness refers to the ability of a molecule to maintain its shape or function when its residues are mutated. A feature with higher robustness can have a greater number of mutations without undergoing structural change. Proteins composed of helices have been shown to be more robust to mutations than strands and both are more robust than coils (Fig. 6) . In other words, proteins that are composed of helices are more likely to retain their folded conformation when their residues are mutated 28 . It is, therefore, interesting that coils, the least robust of the three structural features, dominate the structure of most proteins in the betacoronavirus family. Mutations, by this logic, are more likely to have a high structural impact in these viruses. A notable exception is ORF6 alpha of SARS-CoV-2, which shows a high proportion of helices compared to other proteins across the different viruses.",

We applied variation association tests not only to the whole genome alignment data, but also to 29 specific regions of the viral genome, to obtain sharper resolution of the www.nature.com/scientificreports/ potential function of important variation. We consistently found that Spike protein and nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) significantly represent the viral genome variation among coronavirus families and also among SARS-CoV-2 genomes. We additionally highlight sites undergoing selection in the N gene; the origin of this selective pressure may come from the role of the nucleocapsid protein in producing nuclear localization signals 29 . We also identify mutational hotspots in the 3\u2032-to-5\u2032 exonuclease, endoRNAase, 2\u2032-O-Ribose methyltransferase, Spike protein, ORF7a/b, and ORF8. Mutations in some regions have been linked to host functional alterations such as the role of ORF7a in host immune suppression 30 and ORF8's role in intracellular stress pathways 31, 32 . Functional roles of other viral mutations remain to be characterized. We assessed associations between distances among genes with epidemiological features and found genetic variation correlated with country of exposure and days from start of the pandemic. Our community finding approach using dissimilarity from viral genomes and regions found subclades consistent with GISAID lineage data. Our coherence analysis framework provides an insightful lens to examine viral evolution in a geographic and public health context. We observed striking differences across states, even states which are contiguous to one another. For example, Idaho has a remarkably different coherence score compared to Oregon and Washington, while Louisiana's score is drastically different from that of Texas. This trend is similarly observed at a more global level-China and Kazakhstan, for example, have dramatically different coherence scores. Travel, face covering usage, local restrictions, and other factors may play a role in these differences and additional investigation is warranted to characterize viral spread and containment via genomic features. Regardless, the results suggest that coherence may serve as an important population level measurement for designing and assessing public health efforts.",

After estimating phylogenies, several long branches were observed and subsequently trimmed to account for significant variance in sequence quality. Branches with a length of > 0.0006 were trimmed and removed from the alignment, as were sequences with a proportion of > 0.035 of 'N' characters in the genome. We performed these filtering steps under the assumption that those branches were likely assigned long lengths or an erroneous placement in the tree due to low-quality sequencing runs. We segmented aligned genomes into 29 individual coding and non-coding regions based on the features from the GenBank entry NC_045512.2, the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. The GenBank entry contains the basepair www.nature.com/scientificreports/ position start and end points of each of these 29 regions; that information was used to divide the alignment into constituent regions. Upon dividing, phylogenies were reconstructed for two genes of particular interest-nsp3 and S. Phylogenies were estimated using maximum likelihood as implemented in RAxML as described above.
