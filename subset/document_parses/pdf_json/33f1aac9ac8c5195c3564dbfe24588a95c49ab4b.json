However, short-read RNA sequencing approaches generally fail to capture the primary 5' and 3' boundaries of transcripts, confounding the discovery of key transcription initiation and termination events as well as operon architectures. Yet, the elucidation of these elements is crucial for the understanding of the strategy of transcription regulation during the infection process, which is currently lacking beyond a handful of model phages. To this end, we developed ONTcappable-seq, a specialized long-read RNA sequencing technique that allows end-to-end sequencing of primary prokaryotic transcripts using the Nanopore sequencing platform. We applied ONTcappable-seq to study transcription of Pseudomonas aeruginosa phage LUZ7, obtaining a comprehensive genome-wide map of viral transcription start sites, terminators, and complex operon structures that fine-regulate gene expression. Our work provides new insights in the RNA biology of a non-model phage, unveiling distinct promoter architectures, putative small non-coding viral RNAs, and the prominent regulatory role of terminators during infection. The robust workflow presented here offers a framework to obtain a global, yet fine-grained view of phage transcription and paves the way for standardized, in depth transcription studies for microbial viruses or bacteria in general.",

            "text": "Over the last decade, high-throughput sequencing approaches have fuelled a new era of molecular research in bacteria and their viral predators, bacteriophages. The surge in microbial transcriptome studies has provided major insights in the fundamentals of their transcription strategies and mechanisms of gene regulation (1) (2) (3) . To date, short-read RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technology remains the leading platform to record the global transcriptional state of phage-infected bacteria (4) (5) (6) (7) . However, standard RNA-seq techniques often fail to capture key transcriptional events such as transcription initiation and termination, as these approaches do not discriminate between primary and processed transcripts. As a consequence, the annotation of transcription start sites (TSS) and transcription termination sites (TTS), representing the original boundaries of primary transcripts, is generally confounded by the extensive in vivo processing of transcripts in the RNA pool (1) . Prior to sequencing, various strategies can be used to enrich the fraction of primary transcripts in the RNA population and facilitate global TSS determination in prokaryotes. The main strategy is differential RNA-seq (8) , in which processed transcripts are depleted from the RNA pool using terminator exonuclease treatment. Conversely, Cappable-seq relies on a targeted enrichment of primary RNAs by enzymatically labelling their 5' triphosphate group (9) . These strategies have yielded comprehensive transcription initiation maps of numerous bacteria and have recently also been used to study viral infection (10, 11) . However, as both techniques rely on short-read sequencing technology, termination sites remain more difficult to delineate and information on transcript continuity and operon complexity is lost during sample processing.",

Like other relatives of coliphage N4, LUZ7 has a peculiar transcriptional strategy that relies successively on three different RNA polymerases (RNAP) (20, 21) . Upon phage infection, a large virionencapsulated RNAP (vRNAP) is co-injected with the viral DNA and initiates transcription of the early genes from single-stranded hairpin promoters. Among the early phage gene products, the heterodimeric RNAP (RNAPII) and single-stranded DNA-binding protein Drc activate transcription of the middle genes (22) . Finally, the host RNAP takes over during the final infection stage and carries out transcription from late phage promoters, which weakly resemble the \u03c3 70 promoter consensus motif (23) . However, no middle and late viral promoters have been definitively identified in LUZ7 and its closest relatives, despite the availability of RNA-seq data for one of these phages (24) . This gap of knowledge and a complex transcriptional strategy makes LUZ7 an interesting model to benchmark our method and at the same time unravel the unknowns of LUZ7 genome transcription.",

The RNA transcripts are subjected to an enzymatic capping reaction that specifically labels the 5' triphosphate group hallmarking the beginning of primary transcripts with a desthiobiotin tag (9) . Next, the transcripts are polyadenylated to preserve their 3' ends and make them compatible with nanopore RNA sequencing library preparation.

In this manner, we observed 25 primary and three secondary phage TSS, and found a considerable overlap between the five different TSS categories (Figure 4a ). Multiple sampling points throughout the LUZ7 infection allowed us to distinguish between early, middle, and late phage promoters, from which three different RNAPs successively initiate transcription during infection. Transcription of the LUZ7 genome begins after the phage co-injects its viral DNA along with a large vRNAP that drives transcription from early phage promoters. After analysing the viral primary transcriptome during the early infection stage, nine TSSs and their cognate early promoter sequences were identified, including two promoters that were previously predicted after inspection of the LUZ7 genome (21) . The majority of early promoters contain a typical hairpin structure similar to that of coliphage N4 early promoters (Figure 4b) , with a \u22654 base pairs (bp) stem and a conserved three nucleotide loop (54) .

In N4, RNAPII prefers to start transcription from thymidine and recognizes promoters with two consensus motifs in a sequence-specific manner, whereas transcription initiation by 7's NAPII appears to be directed by the recognition of hairpin structures (20) . These results indicate that ONTcappable-seq can help infer the requirements of RNAPII promoter recognition in N4-like phages, which has proven to be very challenging in the past.

However, the determination of true TTSs is often blurred by the activity of 3' to 5' exonucleases that obfuscate the true 3' boundaries of NA molecules. As some of the major bacterial ribonucleases show a substrate preference for transcripts with 5' monophosphate termini, primary transcripts with intact 5' triphosphate groups are less susceptible to NA processing and are more likely to contain their original termination ends (56, 57) .

In general, transcription termination motifs were located on the phage genome by detecting local maxima of 3' read ends in our enriched datasets, revealing a total of 61 termination sites, among which 14 are predicted to be intrinsic, factorindependent terminators (Supplementary Table S3 Figure   S5c ). Interestingly, ten terminators showed altered readthrough levels (\u226530%) throughout the infection. This suggests that these dynamic transcriptional terminators may help tweak LUZ7 gene expression levels throughout the infection (Figure 6b,c) . For example, the TE of terminator T8 is less than 5% at the early infection stage, allowing almost all transcripts to fully span the early transcribed orf15, whereas 10 minutes post-infection the TE of T8 increases and almost 50% of the transcripts end prematurely within the orf15 gene body. Similarly, the TE of terminator T42 decreases from 88% in the middle stage of infection to 57% at the late infection stage, enabling more transcripts to read through to gene orf65, which codes for an important regulator in the final transcriptional stage of LUZ7. Modulation of transcription termination is a powerful strategy to regulate gene expression programs and has also been investigated in detail in a handful of phages, including coliphages \u03bb and HK022 and Thermus thermophilus phage P23-45 (58) (59) (60) (61) . The phage-encoded antiterminators manipulate the host RNAP and enable it to bypass terminators at the appropriate transcription stage during infection. In LUZ7, the varying terminator read-through levels throughout infection might point to similar or novel antitermination strategies that successively modifies the different RNAPs during phage transcription in response to regulatory stimuli, though this warrants further investigation.",

An ONT-cappable-seq data track showing the transcriptional pattern at LUZ7 genes orf64-orf69 as an example of sequential readthrough at different termination sites for reads starting at the same TSS and leading to transcripts with up to five additional genes.",

It should be noted that not all annotated genes are included in identified operons. For example, a gene of the tail fiber protein (orf56, 3.2 kb) and of the virion-associated RNAP gene (orf073, 10.2 kb), two of the largest genes encoded by the phage, are not found in detected operons.

Most of the reads that align with this region are less than 250 nt long and lack any apparent protein-coding potential, suggesting the presence of putative small non-coding RNAs (sRNA) in the LUZ7 transcriptome. Closer examination of this condensed transcriptional pattern roughly distinguishes three abundant sRNA candidates, designated as sRNA1, sRNA2, and sRNA3, that partially overlap with each other. Two of these RNA species share the same 5' extremity but use an alternative termination site, resulting in a short and extended version of the transcript.

As expected, the aligned read length distribution was impacted significantly by the enrichment procedure with N50 read lengths varying between 358-372 bp for the enriched samples and 1,511-1,541 bp for the controls. The length difference is more pronounced on the bacterial side and can be largely attributed to rRNA depletion, as the mean reads lengths and N50 values of phage-derived transcripts are similar between enriched and control libraries across different samples. Despite modest average read lengths, the top five longest mapped phage reads in each sample span 3.3 kb-8.3 kb, indicating that the procedure allows end-to-end sequencing of long RNA molecules.

The Drc protein was recently shown to be a key transcriptional regulator during LUZ7 infection, activating the progression from the early to the middle transcription stage by recruiting the LUZ7 RNAPII to middle promoters(22). In addition, in vitro this protein can fully cover large stretches of (ss)DNA when present at high concentrations and since its transcripts are so abundant this is likely also the case in vivo during phage infection.Middle promoters have thus far been impossible to identify in LUZ7 and related phages such as LIT1, despite the availability of middle stage transcription initiation sites in the prototypical phage N4 and RNA-seq data on phage LIT1(24,55). Our ONT-cappable-seq data on RNA from the mid-infection stage did enable us to identify four viral TSSs associated with middle stage infection. Collectively, these middle promoters show a GC-rich hairpin structure that resembles that of the early hairpin promoters, with a stem of \u22656 bp and a 3-4 bp nucleotide loop positioned ~15 bp upstream of the identified TSS (Figure 4c).

For each terminator, the termination efficiency (TE) was determined by calculating the level of readthrough across the termination site, and a wide range of terminator strengths was observed (Supplementary figure S5b).

Whereas the crucial involvement of Drc in the transcriptional regulation of LUZ7 has already been demonstrated(22), a function for gp01 has not yet been identified.Consistent with the transcriptional landscape of LIT1, we observe that the LUZ7 genome is almost exclusively transcribed from the Watson strand during early and middle timepoints(24). Interestingly, the transcripts captured mid-infection collectively cover the entire phage genome, including the rightmost region that encodes 29 small ORFans (gp87-gp115)(21). While the function of these genes is unknown, the temporal transcriptional information gained in this study could provide clues on the role of this unique gene cluster during the phage cycle. Given that the middle genes of LUZ7 are primarily involved in phage genome replication, these genes are likely to have a related function. In addition, ONT-cappable-seq data show that middle transcripts extend throughout genomic regions that have late structural gene cassettes encoded on the opposite strand. The same phenomenon was observed in LIT1, where it was suggested that the antisense transcripts are responsible for silencing premature expression of the late genes(24). During the final infection stages, the dominant transcription direction switches in both phages. Presumably, the surge in RNA molecules transcribed from the Crick strand overpowers the antisense transcripts to enable the timely expression of structural and lysis-associated genes(24).",

We showed that ONT-cappable-seq allows full-length transcriptional profiling and enables the simultaneous identification of both 3' and 5' transcriptional boundaries of individual phage transcripts. Using this approach, we pinpointed key phage-encoded transcriptional features at the early, middle, and late infection stages, unveiled complex operon organizations and revealed the presence of novel potential regulatory elements, such as sRNAs. We found many parallels between the transcriptional progression schemes of LUZ7 and coliphage N4, however, the middle promoter motifs identified in this study, together with the Drcmediated recruitment of RNAPII(22), hint to different transcriptional initiation mechanisms from middle promoters of the two viruses. Furthermore, our analysis revealed, extensive and timedependent read-through at phage terminator regions, leading to numerous extended transcription unit variants that incorporate additional genes. Consistent with previous observations in bacteria(15,69), our results suggest that weak termination sites have an important regulatory role in the transcriptional strategy of phages, allowing them to adjust their dense transcriptional patterns in response to different infection stages. The systematic discovery of dynamic transcription terminators by ONT-cappable-seq could help identify and dissect novel regulatory mechanisms to modulate the strength of terminators in phages and their bacterial hosts.While the underlying mechanisms through which the annotated transcriptional features orchestrate gene regulation in LUZ7 warrant further investigation, this work already demonstrates the breadth of knowledge that can be gained from ONT-cappable-seq over classical RNA-seq approaches, which generally fail to capture primary RNA species and delineate transcriptional boundaries. Although this study primarily focused on viral transcripts, similar analyses can be performed on the bacterial side to shed further light on the regulatory features that govern the complex interaction between phages and their hosts.",
