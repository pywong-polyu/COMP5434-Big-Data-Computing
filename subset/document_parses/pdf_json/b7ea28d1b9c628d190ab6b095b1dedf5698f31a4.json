            "text": "IMPORTANCE To restrict the potential transmission and infectivity of SARS-CoV-2, the use of liquid chalk has been a requirement in an active gym setting. However, its effectiveness has not been scientifically proven. Here, we show that the application of liquid chalk before or after virus inoculum significantly impacts recovery of infectious SARS-CoV-2 and influenza viruses but not noroviruses. Thus, our study has shown that the implementation and application of liquid chalk in communal social gym settings is effective in reducing the infectivity of respiratory viruses, and this supports the use of liquid chalk in major sporting events to restrict the impact of COVID-19 on our communities. KEYWORDS SARS-CoV-2, COVID-19, influenza A virus, norovirus, antiseptic, alcohol, noroviruses T he use and application of hand sanitizers in preventing the spread of infectious microbial diseases are primarily based on the 60 to 80% (vol/vol) proportion of alcohol included within these products (1, 2) . The use of hand sanitizers has been an important control measure in limiting the spread of virus during the recent COVID-19 pandemic in some settings (3, 4) . Liquid chalk is a product that comprises magnesium carbonate (chalk), 40 to 80% alcohol (generally ethanol, methanol, or isopropanol), water, and sometimes other additives including resins or proprietary materials, depending on the manufacturer. When applied to the hands, the liquid chalk is distributed across the surface of the hand and then dries into a thin chalk layer as the alcohol evaporates. Due to the high percentage of alcohol, liquid chalk has been suggested to act as a hand sanitizer against SARS coronavirus, although this has yet to be proven experimentally. In this study, we investigated and evaluated the application of various liquid chalk products as antiseptics against the spread and transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the causative agent of the COVID-19 pandemic), influenza A virus (H1N1) (IAV), and norovirus, using the surrogate model of mouse norovirus (MNV).",

First, we tested the application of liquid chalk on a surface that already contained the virus, and second, we tested the ability of liquid chalk to prevent transmission once applied to a surface with subsequent addition of the virus. For the virus-first experiments, a volume containing a known titer of virus (SARS-CoV-2, IAV, or MNV) was applied to a plastic surface. Subsequently, a known volume of four commercially available and widely used liquid chalk products was added, smeared to a thin layer, and then allowed to dry. The entire layer was then resuspended in tissue culture medium, and the chalk particulate was removed by centrifugation. The resultant supernatant was then diluted and added to Vero (SARS-CoV-2), MDCK (IAV), or RAW 264.7 cells (MNV), and virus infectivity was measured by performing a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay. For the chalk-first experiments, the exact same procedure described above was performed except that the volume of chalk was applied first and allowed to dry and then the volume of virus was added to the dried chalk.",

As can be observed in Fig. 1 , all four liquid chalk products significantly impacted the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 virus from the surface to which it was applied. Intriguingly, chalks 1 to 3 all displayed complete loss of the recovery of virus (to the limit of detection) whereas chalk 4 also had a significant impact but some residual virus could be recovered. Of interest was our observation that the application of liquid chalk before or after virus inoculum had an equal effect on the recovery of SARS-CoV-2 virus. In this assay, the alcohol contained in the liquid chalk product was allowed to evaporate prior to contact with virus, suggesting the dried chalk provided a virucidal activity. To confirm the antiviral effects of alcohols, we treated SARS-CoV-2 virus preparations with differing amounts and types of alcohols (including those commonly found in liquid chalk products). As summarized in Table 1 , we observed that all alcohols had a virucidal effect on SARS-CoV-2. Thus, our results indicate that the application and implementation of liquid chalk can be a suitable antiseptic against the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Liquid chalk itself was not cytotoxic to any of the cell types used in this study at the concentrations shown to be effective in reducing virus recovery (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental material).",

To further our study, we also tested the antiviral effect of liquid chalk against another highly infectious and pathogenic respiratory viral pathogen, influenza A virus (IAV). The experiments were performed exactly as described above, and the virus TCID 50 /milliliter was titrated on MDCK cells. As can be observed in Fig. 2 , all four liquid chalk products were effective in restricting the recovery of IAV compared to SARS-CoV-2. However, for IAV the effect was greater when the chalk was applied to the virus inoculum rather than first chalk and then virus, linking the presence of alcohol as a significant antiseptic component against IAV. As can be observed, application of chalks 1 and 3 reduced the virus recovery by approximately 6 logs (TCID 50 /milliliter) whereas chalks 2 and 4 reduced the recovery by ;2.5 logs. When chalk was first applied to the surface, all chalks induced an approximately 2-to 4-log decrease in virus recovery. Overall, these results indicate that the application of liquid both to IAV or onto a surface can reduce the recovery of IAV.",

As a comparator, we also investigated the ability of liquid chalk to inactivate another highly infectious viral pathogen, norovirus. As human norovirus is difficult to cultivate under laboratory conditions, we utilized the widely appreciated surrogate murine norovirus (MNV) for our studies (5) . Again, the experiments were identical to those described above except the viral TCID 50 /milliliter was performed on RAW 264.7 (murine macrophage) cells. Intriguingly, Fig. 3 shows that MNV is relatively resistant to the virucidal properties of the liquid chalk products. We observed that chalks 1 to 3 had very little impact on virus recovery, with a 0.5-log reduction the best that we observed. However, in contrast to SARS-CoV-2 we observed an approximately 1-log reduction upon application of chalk 4. This is interesting as the major difference between MNV and SARS-CoV-2 and IAV is that MNV is a nonenveloped virus, whereas the other two contain a host-derived lipid membrane as their outermost layer. Thus, it would be interesting to identify the constituents of chalk 4 as it was the effective agent against MNV but was observed to be slightly less effective against SARS-CoV-2.",

Neither study as described in its press release investigated the efficiency against other highly infectious viral pathogens. This is the first report to directly compare two highly infectious respiratory pathogen (SARS-CoV-2 and influenza virus) and fomite-transmitted (norovirus) viruses for their resistance or sensitivity to liquid chalk. Overall, this report is novel and the comparison has not been performed previously. We have observed that the other highly pathogenic respiratory virus influenza A virus is also sensitive to liquid chalk compared with SARS-CoV-2. One of the additional findings that we have observed is that the chalk, once dried, i.e., after the alcohol has evaporated, is still effective against both IAV and SARS-CoV-2. Of interest was that not all chalks were observed to be equally effective yet all contained various amounts of alcohol. Intriguingly, noroviruses, which are sensitive to alcohols (8, 9) , are not sensitive to liquid chalk. These observations suggest that it is more than just the alcohol that contributes to resistance or sensitivity under the conditions tested.",

All SARS-CoV-2 infection cultures were conducted within the high-containment facilities in a Physical Containment Level 3 (PC3) laboratory at the Doherty Institute. For the chalkfirst assay, a sample of the liquid chalk was aseptically smeared onto 4 discrete areas covering approximately a 2-cm round surface (approximately 50 ml) on a sterile tissue culture dish and allowed to dry. Fifty microliters of virus inoculum was then applied. Where the inoculum did not absorb into the dry chalk, a slurry of chalk-virus mixture was created using a sterile tip and mixing. Fifteen minutes later, 500 ml infection medium (identical to culture medium but without the presence of sera) was added, and the sample was mixed and collected. Chalk was pelleted at 400 \u00c2 g for 3 min, and then a 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 50 ) assay performed on the supernatant as previously described (11, 12) . For the virus-first assay, 50 ml of virus inoculum was applied as a drop to 4 discrete areas of a sterile tissue culture dish followed by addition of 50 ml liquid chalk. A sterile tip was used to mix the chalk with virus, and the mixture was left for 15 min. In the same way as the chalk-first procedure, 500 ml infection medium was added and sample was mixed, and then remaining virus present in the sample was quantitated by TCID 50 assay. For both tests, the no-chalk control received 50 ml infection medium only instead of the liquid chalk.",
