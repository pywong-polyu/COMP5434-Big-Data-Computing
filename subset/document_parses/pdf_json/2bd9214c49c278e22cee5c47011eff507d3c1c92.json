After 6 months of continuous treatment, the treatment effect of methamphetamine withdrawal symptom score before and after treatment was used; Hamilton Anxiety Scale score and Hamilton Depression Scale were used to compare the anxiety and depression situation of the two groups; the brain wave \u03b1 and \u03b8 wave situation of the two groups were compared.",

            "text": "Methamphetamine (METH) is a pure white crystal with a similar appearance to ice. It is an amphetamine type central nervous stimulant (Morgan et al., 2010) . METH has a great influence on cerebral blood flow perfusion, glucose metabolism, some biochemical substances and even local brain structure, and it is highly addictive. METH drugs mainly include heroin, opium, etc. Although the physical symptoms after withdrawal are mild, mental withdrawal is more difficult, and most patients relapse due to mental withdrawal symptoms (Rezaei and Saadat, 2019; Dasgupta, 2020; Ghiabi, 2020) . Paliperidone palmitate longacting injection is an atypical anti-psychotic long-acting injection (Kim et al., 2012; Attard et al., 2014; Nikoli et al., 2016; Nikoli et al., 2017) . Paliperidone palmitate can be hydrolyzed into paliperidone in the body, which inhibits mental excitement and related psychiatric diseases by antagonizing central dopamine D2 receptors and serotonin 2 receptors (Miller et al., 2019; Entescu, 2020) . At present, paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection has been widely used in the treatment of schizophrenia and other diseases. Theoretically, paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection can prevent the relapse of METH addicts by regulating the nervous system, but there are not many clinical studies on this aspect. Paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection is a new type of antischizophrenia long-acting injection. It is currently commonly used in the treatment of acute and maintenance schizophrenia. Once a month, it is beneficial to improve the compliance and non-compliance of patients with medication. Affect the work and life of patients and return to society as soon as possible. After treatment, patients with methamphetamine addiction will experience withdrawal symptoms such as anxiety, irritability and restlessness. The relief of anxiety symptoms can prove to support the reduction of withdrawal symptoms, thereby reducing relapse. Methamphetamine addiction patients often have the same symptoms as patients with schizophrenia, so it could choose the same treatment drug paliperidone palmitate longacting injection.",

            "text": "After withdrawal from the use of MA, patients who abuse METH often suffer from uninteresting, unexplainable depression, anxiety, unwillingness to deal with people, and slow response. When the patient relapses, there will be a sense of excitement and pleasure, and will have great dependence on this. In order to judge the patient's METH withdrawal status, the METH withdrawal symptom score can be used from the 14 aspects of appetite, fatigue, drowsiness, medication desire, drowsiness, interest in communication, concentration, anxiety, depression, labor or work, study, self-control, nausea, headache and suicidal thoughts to evaluate the patient's withdrawal status. This study found that the scores of METH withdrawal symptoms in the study group were significantly lower than those in the control group after 3 months of treatment and 6 months of treatment. It shows that paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection can effectively help patients with METH abuse to withdraw from addiction. METH has a sympathomimetic mechanism. It enters the brain and exerts a strong central excitatory effect. Whenever METH is used, it will stimulate the brains of long-term METH abusers to produce excitement and pleasure (Alexander, 2019; Demirci et al., 2020; Hill et al., 2020; Willis and Painter, 2020) . Discontinuing METH for a period of time will make the patient feel depressed, at the same time there will be insomnia, pessimism, world weariness, upset and night sweats. Anxiety, depression, etc. will appear after a period of time. In this study, the Hamilton Depression and Anxiety Score Scale was used to detect anxiety and depression of the two groups of patients. It was found that the Hamilton depression scores of the two groups of patients decreased significantly over time. It shows that with the progress of treatment, the patient's anxiety and depression can be relieved to a certain extent, so that the patient's desire for the pleasure of relapse of METH has a certain degree of reduction. At the same time, the Hamilton depression score of the study group was significantly lower than that of the control group, indicating that the use of paliperidone palmitate long-acting injection can further reduce the patient's anxiety and depression, further reduce the patient's dependence on METH smoking, and can effectively prevent the patient from relapse. Past use of electroacupuncture has better improvement in METH withdrawal symptoms and emotional anxiety, which is consistent with the conclusions drawn in this study (Ting-Ting et al., 2009; Cui et al., 2013; Ma et al., 2015) . Brain waves will produce different amplitudes with different mental states. Among them, the \u03b1 wave (Alpha wave) is 8-12 Hz, which is most obvious when people are quiet, relaxed, and not excited. The \u03b8 wave (Theta wave) is 4-8 Hz. This brain wave will increase significantly when a person is depressed. The abuse of METH will cause damage to the brain structure and make normal brain waves abnormal (Lee and Pau, 2002; Gekht et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2011) . This study showed that the \u03b1 wave amplitude and Fourier transformed \u03b1 brain wave (FFT \u03b1 ) of the study group were significantly higher than those of the control group, and the \u03b8 wave amplitude and Fourier transformed \u03b8 brain wave (FFT \u03b8 ) amplitude were significantly lower than those of the control group. It shows that the patients in the study group are calmer after METH withdrawal, and have less negative emotions such as depression. This shows that the patients in the study group are less dependent on the excitement of METH after treatment, their mentality is more peaceful, and the probability of relapse is lower.",
