            "text": "A cute kidney injury (AKI) is a significant complication in critically ill children, as it results in increased morbidity and mortality. [1] [2] [3] [4] AKI develops predominantly because of the injury and necrosis of renal proximal tubule cells, often concurrently with sepsis (sepsis-associated AKI, SA-AKI). Part of the disease process in patients with AKI is often the development of a systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), resulting in cardiovascular collapse, ischemic damage to vital organs, and multiorgan dysfunction (MOD). 5, 6 The development of AKI in children with sepsis is associated with higher mortality. 7, 8 The major clinical manifestations of sepsis and SIRS are due to the excessive dysregulation of the host response to infection or injury rather than direct consequences of the invading pathogen or tissue damage. 9, 10 Central to this initial immunologic response is activation of leukocytes, predominately neutrophils, and damaged microvascular endothelium resulting in cardiovascular instability, lung injury, and kidney dysfunction. 11 Although leukocytes play an essential role in combating septic shock as demonstrated by the recurrence of life-threatening infections in patients with neutropenia or leukocyte defects, 12, 13 if the leukocyte response is uncontrolled, collateral tissue damage may occur, resulting in solid organ dysfunction.",

            "text": "Despite advancements in kidney replacement therapy and blood purification technologies, little improvement in the morbidity and mortality rates of AKI or SA-AKI have occurred over the last several decades. The mortality rates in children with AKI and MOD requiring CKRT continues to approach 50%. [14] [15] [16] Children who survive an AKI episode are at increased risk of long-term sequelae, including chronic kidney disease (CKD). [17] [18] [19] Thus, for effective therapies for AKI/SA-AKI, both of these short-and long-term outcomes are needed. Because activated leukocytes are central to the pathogenesis/progression of septic shock and other clinical inflammatory disorders, a variety of new therapeutic approaches are being considered to limit the deleterious clinical effects of activated leukocytes that result from a dysregulated immune response to sepsis. 20 The SCD (SeaStar Medical, Inc., Denver, CO) immunomodulates activated circulating leukocytes and provides a new therapeutic approach to SIRS and AKI. The discovery of this approach was based on an unexpected observation during a phase II clinical trial of a tissue-engineered bioartificial kidney in adult ICU patients with AKI progressing to MOD, whereby the control arm (without regenerated human acute tubular epithelial cells) had much better outcomes with RCA than heparin CKRT anticoagulation controls. [21] [22] [23] The SCD is used within an extracorporeal blood circuit ( Figure 1 ) to sequester activated leukocytes. The leukocytes are deactivated within a low ionized calcium (iCa 2\u00fe ) environment promoted with clinically accepted CKRT RCA protocols. The SCD combines a sequestering membrane and a biologic moiety (citrate) that together reset and immunomodulate the dysregulated leukocyte activation kinetics of SIRS associated with sepsis and AKI. This approach has been confirmed in a preclinical large animal model of septic shock, 24 and in human clinical trials. 23, 25, 26 Importantly, a phase III Investigational Device Exemption randomized controlled, multicenter trial demonstrated the effectiveness of SCD therapy to reduce a composite endpoint consisting of 60-day mortality or dialysis dependency in adult ICU patients with AKI and MOD requiring CKRT. 27 This study also demonstrated an excellent safety profile for the SCD.",

Children of 15 kg or more in weight, up to 22 years of age, who were admitted to an ICU were screened for eligibility. Subjects who had AKI, as defined by the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria, 29 and MOD and were receiving CKRT as part of the standard of clinical care were eligible to be enrolled in the study. MOD was defined as respiratory disease requiring invasive mechanical ventilation and/or cardiovascular compromise requiring the provision of a continuous infusion of an inotropic/vasoactive medication. These criteria have been repeatedly shown to be associated with AKI [30] [31] [32] Subject severity of illness was assessed by the Pediatric Risk of Mortality II score (PRISM II) in the 12 hours before SCD initiation. 33 The adult phase III study exclusion criteria were modified over the course of this pediatric study to be more relevant to children (Supplemental Table S1 ). For example, the use of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was a contraindication, but ECMO is used commonly in pediatric sepsis, and after several screen failures based on ECMO, the FDA agreed to lift this exclusion. The institutional review board at each center approved the study prior to patient enrollment. Written informed consent was obtained from the subject's parents for those younger than 18 years of age, and/or a person with medical decisionmaking power for subjects 18 years of age or older prior to subject enrollment. Study personnel adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. The study received an Investigational Device Exemption (G120174) from the US FDA and was registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02820350) prior to study commencement. The study was funded mostly by an Office of Orphan Products Development grant (R01FD005092) from the US FDA with a small subsequent grant from SeaStar Medical Inc. to complete the final 2 subjects' enrollment. As this was primarily a safety study (AEs and serious AEs [SAEs]), results and progress were reviewed by an external data safety monitoring board at least annually or at completion of 5, 10, and 16 subjects, whichever came first, to determine if any AEs occurred that would require study termination or modification.",

            "text": "The precise mechanism of action of the SCD is becoming better understood and appears to be an immunomodulatory process that inhibits leukocyte activation, a critical component of the SIRS leading to MOD. The modulation of the dysregulated inflammatory state also allows recovery of renal function in AKI and other associated organ failures. The cartridge acts as an SCD in the presence of citrate anticoagulant to bind and immunomodulate potentially damaging circulating leukocytes. This perspective is based on evolving data from in vitro bench studies, preclinical animal models, and human clinical trials using measurements of inflammatory biomarkers and leukocyte cell sorting, cytometric analysis. The low iCa 2\u00fe environment during RCA and the low shear stress along the blood pathway within the SCD promotes a selective binding of the most activated neutrophils and monocytes to the membranes of the device. 24, 28, 41 This selectivity is due to the calcium dependency of leukocyte-binding processes. Once bound, the activated neutrophils are promoted in the low iCa 2\u00fe environment to transition from delayed apoptosis to an apoptotic program and released back to the systemic circulation. [42] [43] [44] The transition of these neutrophils to apoptosis and release results in the clearance of these previously highly activated inflammatory cells via welldescribed pathways of phagocytosis and digestion within macrophages in the bone marrow and liver. 45 A continuous process of binding, apoptotic conversion, release, and clearance from the circulation of the most activated circulating neutrophils results in immunomodulation of the systemic inflammatory process to a less proinflammatory state. 41 For monocytes, the most activated, proinflammatory circulating monocyte pool is selectively bound to the SCD. The binding and sequestration of this monocyte subset promotes a shift of the circulating pool of the proinflammatory monocytes to a patrolling, reparative phenotype. This shift thereby promotes immunomodulation of circulating monocytes from a degradative phenotype to a reparative, recovery subset, 24, 46 enhancing tissue repair and functional recovery. Given the limited sample size of 16 subjects agreed on with the FDA to establish safety for a Humanitarian Device Exemption application, we can make no claims about the efficacy of the SCD on patient-related outcomes. However, the 75% survival rate observed compares favorably to published CKRT studies in critically ill children with MOD. The largest multicenter study assessed 116 children in the ppCRRT Registry who received mechanical ventilation or a vasoactive agent, which were identical inclusion criteria to the current study, yet the survival rate to ICU discharge was 51.7%. 16 A more recent single-center study of children receiving CKRT reveals a strikingly similar survival rate in 130 patients receiving a vasoactive medication (50.0%) or mechanical ventilation (50.7%) on CKRT. 15 In addition, similar to results seen in adult clinical studies evaluating SCD treatment, none of the survivors in this pediatric study was dialysis dependent at 60 days. In fact, all 12 survivors had normal kidney function at 60 days. Prior experience in pediatric patients with AKI has reported a CKD incidence rate of 10% to 60% of long-term CKD. [17] [18] [19] 47 Also, the 2 subjects who were treated with SCD with integration of a CKRT circuit into ECMO support had no SCD-related AEs. Although both subjects did not survive, these safety data are important to acknowledge as a recent report showed rapid improvements in respiratory and inflammatory indices in SCD-treated adults with COVID-19-related acute respiratory distress syndrome requiring ECMO support. 48 In summary, we demonstrated a high level of safety of SCD therapy in pediatric patients with AKI and MOD receiving CKRT standard of care. Although we cannot make efficacy claims, the 75% survival rate and 100% renal recovery/normal kidney function rate in surviving children suggest a favorable benefit-to-risk ratio in this critically ill pediatric population. Further studies will be required to establish safety in smaller children, feasibility of integration with other CKRT platforms, and to demonstrate improved patient outcomes compared with current supportive therapy, which is associated with a high rate of CKD in survivors. We plan to develop a larger-scale SCD efficacy trial once we have received the Humanitarian Device Exemption from the US FDA.",
