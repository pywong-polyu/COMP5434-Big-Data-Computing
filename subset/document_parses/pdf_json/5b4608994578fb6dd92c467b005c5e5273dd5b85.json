Leading this trend is the Oxford Nanopore sequencing platform, which currently offers the hand-held MinION instrument and even smaller instruments on the horizon. This technology has been used in several important applications, including the analysis of genomes of major pathogens in remote stations around the world. However, despite the simplicity of the sequencer, an equally simple and portable analysis platform is not yet available. Results. iGenomics is the first comprehensive mobile genome analysis application, with capabilities to align reads, call variants, and visualize the results entirely on an iOS device. Implemented in Objective-C using the FM-index, banded dynamic programming, and other high-performance bioinformatics techniques, iGenomics is optimized to run in a mobile environment. We benchmark iGenomics using a variety of real and simulated Nanopore sequencing datasets of viral and bacterial genomes and show that iGenomics has performance comparable to the popular BWA-MEM/SAMtools/IGV suite, without necessitating a laptop or server cluster.",

The earliest automated approaches, beginning with the capillary-based Sanger sequencing devices in the 1980s, were large bench-top instruments requiring ex-tensive sequencing facilities to prepare and sequence the DNA. In the 2000s, high-throughput second-generation sequencing instruments advanced the field with more compact and simpler designs. However, these advances have been limited in their reach because they are not readily accessible by most individual laboratories and citizen scientists.

Because of its small size, Nanopore sequencing has been used in several environments that would be unthinkable for alternative instruments as diverse as monitoring the Ebola outbreaks in remote areas of Africa [2] , monitoring Zika outbreaks in South America [3] , exploring reptile specimens in the rainforest [4] , and even on the International Space Station [5] . Nanopore sequencing has also played an important role in monitoring the transmission of SARS-COVID-19 around the world [6] [7] [8] . Nanopore sequencing technology works by measuring the change in ionic current as a DNA molecule is passed through a nanopore [1] . The DNA molecules are typically a few hundred to tens of thousands of nucleotides long, and the longest reported read has exceeded 2 million nucleotides [9] . Once sequenced, the raw signal data are base-called into nucleotide strings called reads [10] , which are typically stored in fastq format and saved for further processing, especially read alignment and variant analysis.",

These new approaches are suited to large datasets because of their compact space requirements and fast alignment times. After alignment, variant-calling platforms, such as SAMtools [15] or GATK [16] , systematically scan the alignments to find well-supported variants in the sample using a statistical model to distinguish homozygous from heterozygous variants and rule out spurious sequencing errors.

As with other mobile applications (e.g., web browsing, e-mail, social media), iGenomics can be used in a variety of settings where it would be awkward to use a larger laptop, and many users will also prefer the more intuitive user interface. Furthermore, there are many important scenarios where analyzing these data without high-end computing hardware is desirable, especially in remote environments.

Within the list of all found mutations, the user can scroll through all mutations and then select one to inspect that position in the analysis pane. The second page gives an overview of the alignments, including the percentage of reads matched, the total number of reads input, the number of mutations, and the names of the reads and reference files. On this page the user can also search for positions in the reference genome by position or by a query string, which uses BWT exact match for rapid searching. The third page contains a large picker view that allows the user to intuitively move between sequences/segments in the reference genome. The last page contains a list of known mutations if the user selected a known mutations file during the file input stage.

Accordingly, reads of length 100 bp and sequence error rate of 1.0% were simulated to mirror reads generated by Illumina sequencers and reads of length 1,000 bp and sequence error rate of 10.0% were simulated to mirror reads generated by ONT sequencers.

Consequently, because the simulations use a consistent amount of coverage per genome, the linear increase in runtime is explained by the linear increase in the number of reads to align. It is also worth noting that the iGenomics trend lines closely follow the pattern of those of BWA-MEM + SAMtools.

Consequently, the true novelty of this application is not in the algorithms used but rather how they have been implemented in a mobile environment. The entire workflow for iGenomics is designed to be simple and intuitive. A user effortlessly picks a reads file to analyze and, once selected, the alignment, variant calling, and visualization are completed within The pH1N1 reads were simulated from the (H1N1)pdm09 (A/California/04/2009) genome and the H3N2 reads were simulated from the H3N2 (A/NewYork/03/2015) genome. + Segment identification rate is the number of alignments that aligned to the correct reference within the pan-genome divided by the total number of alignments. seconds. This is accomplished without any internet connectivity through an optimized implementation in Objective-C. iGenomics is designed for quickly computing detailed genetic information about specific mutations within different vi-ral or bacterial genomes. An important use case of iGenomics could be a researcher with limited computational resources sequencing complementary DNA (cDNA) of a coronavirus sample, loading and aligning the cDNA reads with iGenomics, and getting a first analysis of the coronavirus mutations within a few seconds. To support this capability, we have developed a tutorial with the MinION reads (SRX7615629) and consensus genome (MN938384.1) from patient HKU-SZ-002a, as well as the consensus genome from a bat SARS-like coronavirus isolate (MG772934.1) previously used for comparisons [28, 29] . Following the tutorial, these data can easily be downloaded on one's iOS device and imported directly into iGenomics to be analyzed. Another promising capability of iGenomics is its ability to load reference genomes and reads from outside sources, perform alignment and variant calling, and export the results all without any internet access. For example, by using Airdrop to both import and export data from iGenomics, a researcher can analyze DNA in remote locations without any internet connectivity. Because the MinION uses a USB connection that is not available on an iPhone or iPad, users will first need to collect the raw sequencing data on their laptop or server, as well as use these platforms to base call the signal data into nucleotide sequences. However, once sequencers are available that can read DNA directly into iOS devices, iGenomics will work out of the box to allow for importing of this sequenced data, eliminating the requirement for a laptop in the end-to-end analysis pipeline. Future developments for iGenomics are far-reaching as DNA sequencing instruments continue to evolve to the point where they could be directly attached or integrated with mobile devices. In fact, ONT has announced that they hope to have a new sequencer, named the \"SmidgION,\" that connects directly to iOS devices available for researchers in the near future [30] . At that point, using mobile sequencing technology with iGenomics, DNA can truly be sequenced, aligned, and analyzed anywhere and absolute mobility of the genomics field will be achieved. As the processing power and memory contained within mobile devices improves, so will the overall performance of iGenomics in handling even larger and more complex samples.",

For example, the cyclic permutations of the string \"CAT\" with the end-of-string character \"$\" are \"CAT$,\" \"AT$C,\" \"T$CA,\" and \"$CAT,\" which can be sorted as \"$CAT,\" \"AT$C,\" CAT$,\" and \"T$CA.\" This sorted list creates what is known as the Burrows-Wheeler matrix (BWM).

Although there are now some more efficient BWT construction algorithms [31] , given that iGenomics is targeted towards relatively small genomes (<100,000 bp), the amount of time for BWT sorting is negligible compared to the time to align the reads.

The seed size is based on the maximum edit distance (a user-specified parameter) allowed for a read that successfully aligns to be considered a match. The maximum edit distance is inputted as a decimal value edit rate, and multiplying that value by the length of the given read will give the maximum possible edit distance we allow when aligning that read. During the aligning process, each read is split into the edit distance plus 1 segment of equal length. This relies on the widely used technique that if the string matches with \u2264X edits, then \u22651/(X + 1) of the segments must still match without error [32] . For example, if the user allows only 1 edit, the algorithm divides the read into left and right halves [1/(1 + 1)] knowing that the correct alignment will include an exact match of 1 of those segments.",

The last-first property states that the occurrence of any character in the last column of the BWM, which is the BWT, corresponds to the same occurrence of that character in the first column of the BWM. Using the first column of the BWM and the BWT to create an FM-index, the algorithm navigates the rows of the index that contain exact matches and then converts these positions from the BWT to positions in the reference genome (Fig. 6) .",

To determine where to begin the band computation, iGenomics attempts to exact-match a 20 bp substring of the read. A substring length of 20 bp was chosen because we found that it represented the optimal trade-off in terms of performance and reliability of identifying alignments. If the exact match is successful, the banded distance will be computed relative to the matched position of the substring. If the exact match is unsuccessful, an exact match with the 20 bp substring of the read starting at the second character will be attempted.

In a diploid genome, homozygous mutations are mutations that occur on both copies of a chromosome whereas heterozygous mutations occur on 1 copy of a chromosome but not both. iGenomics recognizes heterozygous mutations as positions in the genome where there is a nearly equal coverage of >1 base existing in the set of aligned reads according to a user-specified relative minimum heterozygosity threshold. Thus, if \u22652 bases at a position have relative coverages greater than that threshold, the mutation present at that position is considered to be heterozygous.

(Top left) alignments display, (top right) coverage profile, (bottom left) partially zoomed-out coverage profile, (bottom right) fully zoomed-out coverage profile. The iPad application for iGenomics strongly resembles that of the iPhone application for all views except the analysis ones. In the analysis view, alignment details are always visible at the top of pane and the alignments display/coverage profile is displayed below the details. As with the iPhone version of iGenomics, the user can switch between the alignments display and coverage profile and can zoom out of either to see the relative coverage at varying levels of granularity. Supplementary Figure S8 . iGenomics iPad analysis display. (Top) analysis utilities, (bottom) found mutations list. Tapping the 3line icon (hamburger button) in the top left of the analysis view will bring up the analysis utilities, which contains the same capabilities as the iPhone version of iGenomics but presents views in iPad-native popovers rather than new full-screen pages. Tapping on any of these utilities, such as the \"Mutation List,\" will present the results in a popover.",

Each trend line indicates the runtime for each dataset using the denoted alignment and analysis software; iG indicates iGenomics and bwa indicates the BWA/SAMtools pipeline.

            "text": "Supplementary Figure S1 . Mutation identification accuracy for simulated H1N1 flu datasets. Plots show the accuracy of varying mutation rates and read length for iGenomics (left) and the BWA-MEM/SAMtools (right) pipeline. The results were computed in the same manner as described in the third section of the Results (Simulated read accuracy analysis): the simulated reads consisted of H1N1 read sets simulated with a mean coverage value of 100 and for all combinations of the following sets of parameters: sequence error rates of 0.01, 0.1, and 0.2, mutation rates of 0.001, 0.01, and 0.1, and read lengths of 100, 250, and 1,000 bp. Supplementary Figure S2 . iGenomics reference selection. (Left) launch screen, (middle) file selection page, (right) individual file selector. By pressing the \"Start\" button on the launch screen, the user is brought to the file selection page. Pressing \"Select File\" on the file selection page will allow the user to use the individual file selector to choose a default file (pre-packaged with iGenomics) or imported file (saved to iGenomics from an external app) or to use Dropbox's UI to choose a file from the user's Dropbox account. Additionally, the user can select \"Analyze,\" which will immediately begin to align the input reads to the reference using the most recently used parameters, or \"Configure,\" which will present the parameter selection page.Supplementary Figure S3 . iGenomics alignment parameter selection. (Left) parameter selection page with trimming disabled, (middle) parameter selection page with trimming enabled, (right) computing page. From the file selection page in Supplementary Fig. S2 , if the user chooses \"Analyze,\" the right computing page will be shown and if the user chooses \"Configure,\" the parameter selection page will be shown with the last parameters used. Pressing \"Start Aligning\" from the parameter selection page will begin aligning the reads using the configured parameters. On the computing page, the percentage indicates the total percent of reads aligned and the time remaining indicates the estimated time remaining before the alignment and variant identification process completes. Supplementary Figure S4 . iGenomics summary views. (Top) view selection page, (middle) alignment details page, (bottom) segment selection page. The view selection page allows the user to view the alignments display and coverage profile (shown in Fig. 1 ) as well as the coverage histogram and found mutations list (shown in Supplementary Fig. S5 ). The alignment details page displays information about the alignments, including the reads and reference file names, percentage of reads that matched, and the number of mutations, and allows the user to search the reference genome and adjust the minimum relative heterozygosity value (known as mutation coverage within iGenomics). The segment selection page lets the user intuitively choose a particular segment in the reference genome for which to view alignment information. These 3 pages, in addition to a fourth page (the important mutations display shown in Fig. 1) , can be navigated with just a swipe.",
