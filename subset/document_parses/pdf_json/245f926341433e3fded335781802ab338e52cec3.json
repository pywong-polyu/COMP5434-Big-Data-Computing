We collected 47 biomarkers from each patient within 36 hours before or after the index time: RT-PCR positivity, and tracked whether a patient survived or not for one month following this time. We utilized the autoML from H2O.ai, an open source package for R language. The autoML generated 20 ML models and ranked them by area under the precision-recall curve (AUCPR) on the test set. We selected the best model (model_var_47) and chose a threshold probability that maximized F2 score to make a binary classifier: dead or alive. Subsequently, we ranked the relative importance of variables that generated model_var_47 and chose the 10 most influential variables. Next, we reran the autoML with these 10 variables and likewise selected the model with the best AUCPR on the test set (model_var_10). Again, threshold probability that maximized F2 score for model_var_10 was chosen to make a binary classifier. We calculated and compared the sensitivity, specificity, and positive predicate value (PPV) for model_var_10 and model_var_47.",

When the autoML was retrained with these 10 most important variables, it did not significantly affect the performance (AUCPR= 0.828). For the binary classifiers, sensitivity, specificity, and PPV of model_var_47 was 83.6%, 87.7%, and 69.8% respectively, while for model_var_10 they were 90.9%, 71.1%, and 51.8% respectively.",

            "text": "On January 30 th , 2020, the WHO declared a COVID-19 outbreak which began in Wuhan, China. As of August 1st, 2020, the CDC reported more than 4.5 million cases and 150,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the United States alone [1] . New York City (NYC) became the epicenter in the U.S. with the highest case number and deaths per capita [2] . At our institution, between 3/1/2020-7/3/2020, we admitted 4375 patients who tested positive for COVID-19 and 1088 patients died within 30 days of infection ( Figure 1 ). Many regions worldwide are still fighting the first wave of the pandemic, while other areas that reopened are seeing a resurgence of new cases. In such an emergent situation, it is important for clinicians to triage patients effectively to maximize limited medical resources. In this study, we aimed to find the most important prognostic biomarkers and develop a COVID-19 mortality risk assessment tool using automated machine learning (autoML). Some of the most frequently reported prognostic indicators in COVID-19 patients include gender, Creactive protein (CRP), lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), and lymphocyte count. Other inflammatory markers also often appear to be elevated, such as ferritin, inteleukin-6, tumour necrosis factor-alpha, and interferon gamma [3] [4] [5] . For example, Zhou et al were one of the first groups that showed many correlations with specific biomarkers that are predictive of morbidity/mortality in 191 patients from Wuhan. They found that older patients with d-dimer levels greater than 1ug/mL, and a higher SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score were associated with greater odds of in-hospital death [6] . However, many papers that have investigated biomarkers are largely focused on Chinese hospitals due to the disease's initial emergence in Wuhan [7] [8] [9] [10] . It is essential to understand the clinical characteristics for more recent and diverse cases considering that the virus strain may have mutated since its first appearance [11] .",

In many such ML studies, researchers are only training on one kind of ML model (XGBoost, Random Forest, etc.) and on relatively small datasets with cohorts mainly from China. In addition, many studies evaluated their model performance only on area under the curve (AUC) and without area under the precision recall curve (AUCPR) [3, 12, 13] . AUC should be used if the outcome class (dead or alive) is relatively balanced. If the outcome is skewed, as it is in data showing that most people survive COVID-19 infection, a model should be evaluated with AUCPR.",

For example, MCV and calcium level (rank 15 and 24 in GBM model) appear to affect the model, but because ML models are a non-linear combination of variables, it is difficult to understand how they are contributing and if there is clinical significance. Further investigation is needed on how these biomarkers are altered in COVID-19 infected patients. However, it is interesting to note that ML models can identify these alterations.",

H2O.ai has internal imputation method to fill in these missing values [15] . Our cohort was limited to patients severe enough to be admitted, and findings may not generalize to all COVID-19 infected patients. Finally, the nature of training ML models involves randomization. In this study, we presented one representative autoML run. To check for consistency, we tested multiple random splitting between training and test set and retrained the autoML each time. We found that Stacked Ensemble models usually perform the best, followed by GBM and XGBoost. The overall performance of each model was minimally altered from the randomization process. Variable ranking shifted slightly with each autoML run, especially in the lower-ranking variables. However, the 10 most important biomarkers we chose consistently ranked at the top.",

First, we are in process of gathering data from other institutions and countries to make our model more generalizable. We imagine that institutions with many COVID-19 patients can develop their own ML models specialized for their population; institutions with minimal COVID-19 cases can use a more generalized model trained from a metadata. Second, we are working to implement reinforcement learning into our model. Reinforcement learning will allow us to update the model in real time as we accumulate more data. This will make the model responsive to a rapidly changing environment. Lastly, we are working to open the black box of ML models to understand how they are making such highly accurate decisions. For example, we would like to know: what is the cut-off value for each variable to be considered important? How are variables related to each other? Deciphering the black box of ML models is a research field of its own. However, it will allow us to use the models more practically, and possibly provide insight into the mechanism of disease of COVID-19 infection [26].",
