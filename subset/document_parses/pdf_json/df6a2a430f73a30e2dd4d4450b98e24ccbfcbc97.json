            "text": "A crucial question in the governance of infectious disease outbreaks is how to ensure that people continue to adhere to mitigation measures for the longer duration. The present paper examines this question by means of a set of cross-sectional studies conducted in the United States during the COVID-19 pandemic, in May, June, and July of 2020. Using stratified samples that mimic the demographic characteristics of the U.S. population, it seeks to understand to what extent Americans continued to adhere to social distancing measures in the period after the first lockdown ended. Moreover, it seeks to uncover which variables sustained (or undermined) adherence across this period. For this purpose, we examined a broad range of factors, relating to people's (1) knowledge and understanding of the mitigation measures, (2) perceptions of their costs and benefits, (3) perceptions of legitimacy and procedural justice, (4) personal factors, (5) social environment, and (6) practical circumstances. Our findings reveal that adherence was chiefly shaped by three major factors: respondents adhered more when they (a) had greater practical capacity to adhere, (b) morally agreed more with the measures, and (c) perceived the virus as a more severe health threat. Adherence was shaped to a lesser extent by impulsivity, knowledge of social distancing measures, opportunities for violating, personal costs, and descriptive social norms. The results also reveal, however, that adherence declined across this period, which was partly explained by changes in people's moral alignment, threat perceptions, knowledge, and perceived social norms. These findings show that adherence originates from a broad range of factors that develop dynamically across time. Practically these insights help to improve pandemic governance, as well as contributing theoretically to the study of compliance and the way that rules come to shape behavior.",

Until there is a vaccine or a cure that can halt a pandemic outbreak, the only protection that people have is to ensure that the spread of the disease is minimized. This entails a range of changes in basic human conduct, from things that have limited economic and social consequences, such as better hand hygiene and the adoption of face masks, to profound, costly changes such as social distancing, forced isolation, quarantine, and broader lockdowns. Such measures only work, however, if people effectively follow them. In this way, the 2020 pandemic has shown the importance of understanding compliance and adherence to outbreak mitigation measures.",

When many governments adopted lockdown rules and social distancing measures as compulsory mandates during this initial \"first wave\" period, compliance levels were high. This is demonstrated not only by drastic reductions in mobility [1] , but also by consequences associated with this, such as the unprecedented event that the price of oil turned negative [2] . A recent review identifies a range of variables that predicted compliance with social distancing measures during the first pandemic wave, including psychosocial, institutional, and situational variables, as well as incentives [3] . Furthermore, this review showed that some highly important policy variables were not associated with compliance during this period. These included for instance deterrence where neither the threat of stricter punishment nor more certain punishment predicted compliance.",

Yet as the outbreak was neither controlled nor overcome through a vaccine or medicine, mitigation measures have remained essential for keeping the virus at bay. During the fall, however, many countries found themselves faced with a second pandemic wave. This raises the question of how adherence to mitigation measures has developed during the summer months after the initial strict behavioral measures of the first wave were repealed. Is it the case that social distancing has degraded back toward prepandemic normality, and thus gave fertile ground for a resurgence of infections? And if so, which factors shaped such changes and caused people to abandon (or sustain) social distancing?",

            "text": "To understand these questions, the present research collected three cross-sectional surveys in the United States in May, June, and July of 2020. Using stratified samples that mimic the demographic characteristics of the U.S. population, we examined how Americans' adherence to social distancing measures has developed across this period, and which factors have sustained or undermined this. To answer this question, we consider a broad range of influences, which can be arranged into six categories. First, factors related to people's practical understanding and knowledge of the measures. Second, factors related to their perception of the costs and benefits of the measures. Third, factors related to their perceptions of the legitimacy and procedural justice of the measures and the responsible authorities. Fourth, personal factors relevant to adherence. Fifth, influences from people's social environment. And sixth, practical circumstances that may constrain or facilitate their adherence. The paper allows us to understand how these variables shape adherence to social distancing measures in the critical period that follows as a country starts to reopen following a first wave in a pandemic outbreak. By doing so, we contribute to the overall understanding of pandemic governance, as well as to insight into the interaction between rules and human conduct most generally. We also contribute to compliance theory by illuminating how influences at each of these levels may shape adherence over a longer time period. And finally, we identify important avenues for policy, on how adherence to mitigation measures can be promoted when strict measures are lifted.",

At the beginning of April, approximately 70% of Americans were subject to stay-at-home and social distancing measures [4, 5] . However, by the end of April, infections began to decline [6] , and some states began re-opening or reopened altogether, starting with the Southern and Midwestern regions [7] . During the same period, Federal social distancing guidelines were repealed [8] , although the requirement remained in place at nearly every state level [9] . Infection rates strongly accelerated from mid-June to late July, however, reaching a peak of almost 75,000 new cases per day [6] .",

In operationalizing the present study we broadly distinguish six categories of variables:",

According to the rational choice theory of compliance, people's tendency to adhere should decrease as the costs of doing so become larger, and increase as the benefits improve [23, 24] . Our surveys assess different aspects of this. A first aspect is people's perception of the threat of the virus. Mitigation measures become more beneficial if people regard the virus as a severe threat to their own health and/or that of others. Yet the health risk of COVID-19 varies between individuals [25] [26] [27] , as do subjective perceptions of this risk [28] . For this reason, we expected that adherence to social distancing measures would be higher among people who perceive the virus as a greater health threat. The second aspect is the cost people personally face due to the mitigation measures. Due to the pandemic and the measures to mitigate it, many Americans have suffered decreases to their income or employment opportunities [29] . We expected that adherence would be lower among people for whom the personal costs of the mitigation measures are greater. The final aspect is fear of punishment (deterrence). Although social distancing measures were not widely enforced in the U.S., sanctions did occur during the first wave lockdown [30] ; furthermore, severe sanctions were communicated for other COVID-related violations [31] . Research on perceptual deterrence suggests that subjective perceptions of punishment may also influence compliance [32] . For this reason, we also examined subjective perceptions of punishment for not following social distancing measures, separating punishment certainty and severity-the key dimensions separated by general deterrence theory [33] [34] [35] . We expected that adherence would be higher among people who regarded punishment as more certain, and more severe.",

As Max Weber has explained: \"So far as it is not derived merely from fear or from motives of expediency, a willingness to submit to an order imposed by one man or a small group, always implies a belief in the legitimate authority (Herrschaftsgewalt) of the source imposing it\" (see [36] p. 37). Accordingly, we also aimed to capture such legitimacy perceptions in our study. Jackson and Gau [37] describe legitimacy as the property or quality of possessing rightful power and the acceptance of authority. To the extent that the law and legal authority are perceived to be legitimate, people will feel more obligated to obey the law. Individuals judge legal authority to be legitimate to the extent that they embody the values of being appropriate and proper [38, 39] . Our study assesses six core areas of this. First, we assess people's moral alignment with social distancing measures; i.e., the extent to which they agree with the substance of these measures [40, 41] . During the period that preceded our study, there were clear indications that support for mitigation measures differed among Americans [42, 43] . We expected that adherence would be higher among people with greater substantive support for social distancing measures.",

The more that people see that rules are made and enforced in a procedurally fair manner, the more likely it is that they will see them as legitimate-and the more likely it becomes that they will feel bound to obey such measures and come to comply with them [40, 41, 44] .",

Such sense of duty is a core expression or a downstream consequence of their felt legitimacy, as people with a higher sense of legitimacy, in theory, develop more of a sense of a duty to obey rules developed and enforced by authorities they view as legitimate [45] . We have used three measures to capture this. First is the normative obligation to obey the law, which captures people's sense of duty to obey the law out of moral obligation [46] . Second is the non-normative duty to obey the law, which originates in a sense of coercion or fear, where people feel obligated to obey the law out of fear of the authorities [46] . And last is people's obligation to obey the law in general, which captures the extent to which they feel that they should obey the law regardless of different circumstances [47] [48] [49] . 4 . Personal factors relevant to adherence. As the fourth facet of adherence to social distancing measures, we look at personal factors that are relevant for people's stance toward mitigation measures, or for compliance more generally. A first factor is people's trust in science. Scientific evidence (and indeed, scientists) have played an important (and very visible) role in the public health response to COVID-19, and the measures to mitigate it. Yet trust in science varies between individuals, which may strongly affect their willingness to follow these measures [50, 51] . We expected that adherence to social distancing measures would be higher among people who have greater trust in science. A second, related factor is trust in traditional media. Research suggests that distrust in traditional media is associated with greater belief in misinformation about COVID-19 [52] . This, in turn, predicts lower adherence to measures to mitigate it [53] . Accordingly, we expected adherence to social distancing measures to be higher among people with more trust in traditional media. The third personal factor is impulsivity. To effectively distance oneself from others, it is necessary to inhibit one's usual tendency to get close to them. However, people differ in their capacity to control their impulses, and high levels of impulsivity predict deviant and rule breaking behavior [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] . We therefore expected adherence to be lower among more impulsive individuals. Last, we examined people's emotional state. According to strain theory, people may cope with negative emotions through rule violating behavior [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] . Indeed, also in context of the COVID-19 pandemic, studies show that negative emotions may lead to lower compliance with quarantine measures [66] . Thus, we expected adherence to be lower among people who experienced more negative emotions.",

In many situations, it is highly visible whether others do (or do not) adhere to social distancing measures. Research shows that perceptions of the norms for complying with particular rules or requests can have an important effect on people's own tendency to do so: the more that they see others comply, the more likely they are to do so themselves; the more that they see others violate or disobey, the more likely they are to offend [67] [68] [69] [70] . In light of this, our surveys assessed people's perceptions of the norms for social distancing within their community. We expected adherence to be higher among people who perceived more adherence within their community.",

            "text": "6. People's practical circumstances. As the final facet, we looked at the practical circumstances that may shape people's adherence. Whether people can adhere to social distancing measures (or conversely, can violate these) may also be contingent on the extent to which their practical circumstances allow them to do so. Our surveys looked at different aspects of this. First, people's practical capacity to adhere. In order for people to effectively do as social distancing measures demand, it is necessary that their practical circumstances effectively allow them to do so. However, in practice, their capacity to adhere may often vary. For example, keeping a safe distance from others may be more difficult in crowded or constrained environments, or in occupations that cannot be conducted from home or at a distance. Capacity thus may strongly shape adherence, but it should be understood that these concepts are not identical. Simply having the capacity to commit a crime does not mean that one also will do so. The same applies to social distancing: being practically able to keep a distance from others does not mean that someone wishes to do so. We expected adherence with social distancing measures to be higher among people who had greater practical capacity to adhere to these measures. The second aspect is people's opportunities for violating the measures. In order to violate social distancing recommendations, it first is necessary that there are practical opportunities to do so. However, practical circumstances may make this impossible, for example, when physical environments have been rearranged to separate people from each other. Insights from routine activities theory [71] [72] [73] and situational crime prevention [74, 75] show that there is less rule breaking when there are less practical opportunities to do so. We expected greater adherence with social distancing measures among people who saw less opportunities for violating such measures by getting close to others.",

For political orientation, a considerable number of participants preferred to not disclose their preference (Survey 1: 12.4%; Survey 2: 10.7%; Survey 3: 12.8%). To enable such cases to be retained in the analysis, this variable was recoded into two dummy variables: one comparing conservative to progressive orientation (1 = very conservative or conservative, 0 = progressive, very progressive, or prefer not to say) and one comparing undisclosed to progressive orientation (1 = prefer not to say, 0 = very conservative, conservative, progressive, very progressive). This approach yielded the same results for adherence as the scale measure, but allowed all cases to be utilized. Additionally, we asked several questions that probed exposure to and risk from COVID-19. Specifically, we asked participants to indicate whether they provided professional care for coronavirus patients, and whether they or anyone they knew had underlying health issues that would put them more at-risk to suffer complications from the coronavirus.",

To illuminate the strictness with which individuals adhere to social distancing recommendations, we also compare frequencies of full adherence. This approach exploits the notion that anyone who reports anything less than full adherence (7 = \"always\") in fact admits to not having followed the measures (either occasionally or more frequently); this therefore represents a stricter measure of adherence than the average. We compared the frequency of full adherence (across all seven situations) between survey waves using negative binomial regression; to compare the probability of full adherence within specific situations, logistic regression was utilized.

As the previous section demonstrates, adherence to social distancing measures declined significantly in the period after the initial first wave lockdown. At the same time, significant changes were observed in many of the variables that were hypothesized to shape adherence. Our next major question is to understand how these processes shaped adherence to social distancing measures during this period. To do so, we estimated a linear regression model, in which adherence was regressed upon the various predictors in a series of hierarchical steps. This model was estimated using the combined data from all three survey waves (N = 2,919), with survey wave included as an additional predictor (1 = May, 2 = June, 3 = July). Collinearity statistics indicated no issues with multicollinearity (all VIFs \ufffd 2.55; all tolerances \ufffd .39). Table 4 displays the results. In Step 1, the model included only the survey wave dummies and the control variables. As shown in Table 4 (column 1), relative to May, adherence decreased significantly in June and in July. Adherence was significantly higher among older participants, female participants, minority group members, people with higher levels of education, and people with higher socio-economic status. Furthermore, adherence was greater among people who suffered from a health condition that placed them at increased risk, or who knew others who suffered from such health conditions. Conversely, adherence was significantly lower among people who professionally cared for COVID patients, and among participants with more conservative political orientations. Lastly, relative to participants from the Northeast region, adherence was significantly lower among participants from the Midwest and the South regions. Together, the model explained only 8% of the variability in adherence, however.",

To examine how these changes contributed to the observed decline in compliance across this period, we finally conducted mediation analyses. These tested whether the effect of survey wave on compliance was mediated by the effect of survey wave on each of the key predictors of adherence.",

The models controlled for all other predictors and control variables, and featured bias-corrected bootstrap confidence intervals (1,000 replications).

In the period after stricter mitigation measures were repealed, during the summer months of 2020, a significant decline in adherence was observed. Across this period, adherence to social distancing measures was shaped by a range of factors, relating to people's practical knowledge and understanding of mitigation measures, their perceptions of their costs and benefits, their perceptions of legitimacy and procedural justice, their personal factors, their social environment, and their practical circumstances. Moreover, changes in the levels of these factors during this period explained (in part) the observed decline in adherence. These findings demonstrate that large-scale behavioral change can be accomplished through a combination of factors situated at different levels. Yet, the study also shows that some variables that have received much attention in general psychological, economic, and criminological compliance scholarship did not play a clear and consistent role in shaping adherence. Across the different steps of our analysis, eight variables emerged as consistent predictors of adherence. Respondents adhered more when (1) they had greater knowledge of social distancing measures, (2) they perceived the virus as a more severe health threat, (3) adherence was more costly for them (possibly reflecting the reverse: that costs were higher for those who adhered more), (4) they morally agreed more with the measures, (5) they were low in impulsivity, (6) they perceived stronger (descriptive) social norms for keeping a safe distance, (7) they had greater practical ability to adhere, and (8) they perceived fewer opportunities for violating the measures. When examining their effect sizes in the final step of the regression model, however, it becomes clear that especially capacity had a critical impact on respondents' adherence (according to Cohen's standards, a large effect). Moral alignment and perceived threat also had a substantial, but smaller impact on adherence (according to Cohen's standards, a small to medium effect). The impact of impulsivity, knowledge, opportunity for violating, personal costs, and social norms was only limited, however (according to Cohen's standards, a small effect).",

            "text": "The impact of the predictors on adherence was largely consistent throughout this period, although the influence of impulsivity became gradually weaker (and the influence of non-normative obligation to obey and trust in science gradually stronger) as the distance from the lockdown period increased. The decline that occurred across this period in levels of knowledge, moral alignment, and perceived social norms for adhering partially explained the observed decrease in adherence. Conversely, the increase in perceived threat that was observed toward the end of this period positively affected the development of adherence. Other variables, however, failed to predict adherence, or no longer did so when other variables were taken into account. These most notably included procedural justice [40, 41] , obligation to obey the law or the responsible authorities [46, 47] , deterrence [33] [34] [35] , and trust in science [50, 51] . Theoretically, the present comparison of adherence over the summer months demonstrates that the nature of behavioral change and influence on behavior is not static. Rather, our findings show that across similar samples of people, with similar measures staying in place, key factors that sustain compliance can grow or decline even in a matter of months. Our data allow us to trace these processes more deeply by examining how the key predictors have changed over the summer months. Although the influence of these variables on adherence was largely consistent throughout this period, the data revealed significant changes in their absolute levels. People reported, for instance, to have more opportunity to violate the social distancing measures (which makes sense given that stay-at-home orders were mostly lifted in this period), lower capacity to adhere, and lower perceived social norms for adherence (consistent with the notion that there were larger crowds, and that more people were expected to resume normal work and social activities). Our mediation analyses revealed that the observed decline in adherence to social distancing measures that was observed during this period was partially explained by the decreases in people's knowledge, moral alignment, and perceived social norms for adhering. Conversely, the increase in perceived threat that was observed toward the end of this period positively affected the development of adherence. When viewed together, these changes provide important indications of why adherence has changed over time. These processes do not seem to indicate that there was a so-called general behavioral fatigue [91, 92] at play at this time, but rather that lower adherence may have resulted from very particular and factual changes in people's circumstances, the environment, and their motivations. By providing insight into which variables do (and do not) shape adherence, the present research offers a more practical way of assessing whether people are able to sustain behavioral change for as long as needed, compared to broad and vague concepts such as behavioral fatigue (which rely more on common-sense understanding than mechanisms from behavioral science). An important question for future research, however, is to understand more deeply how the changes that we observed across this period may be connected to local developments in policy, society, and the pandemic (e.g., see [93] ). For this, a more fine-grained analysis is needed, which takes into account how these processes developed locally at the level of regions, states, counties, or even cities.",

In light of the fact that stricter mitigation measures have been repealed, and thus are no longer widely enforced [94] , it is noteworthy that Americans nevertheless reported moderately high levels (i.e., close to the scale midpoint) of perceived punishment certainty and severity. One explanation for such continuing perceptions of deterrence when there is no longer any enforcement is that there are spillover effects. In this case, this might mean that prior enforcement continues to drive deterrence perceptions even after it has ended, or that enforcement of other measures (e.g., facemasks; quarantine) also shapes deterrence perceptions for social distancing [95] . A second, and related explanation is that people generally do not have very good perceptions of deterrence and can underestimate or overestimate both the certainty and severity of punishment [96] . Importantly, however, even though many Americans considered it quite likely that they would be punished when not keeping a safe distance, and regarded such punishment as quite severe, these beliefs did not predict greater adherence. This finding is in line with studies in other countries where there was actual enforcement of social distancing measures, where also no effects of deterrence on compliance were observed [18] . However, these conclusions clearly oppose belief in the effectiveness of strong punishment for COVID-19 violations [97, 98] .",

For example, the data can inform about relationship between adherence and political orientation or trust in science (both singled out as important predictors of adherence in prior research [50, 51, 99, 100 ], yet neither a significant predictor in our final regression model), or demographic factors like ethnicity or socio-economic status. From the results of the hierarchical regression analysis, it seems plausible that these and other factors may have indirect relationships with adherence, through their effects on more proximal predictors. The data further could illuminate how specific subsets of predictors may interact with each other, or could be used to study other outcome variables (e.g., how these predictors may explain felt negative emotions, or support for authorities, etc.). The present research was primarily oriented on understanding the proximal predictors of adherence. For this reason, we feel that other relationships, such as those outlined above, are best reserved for dedicated manuscripts that are specifically oriented on these questions. We welcome further analyses of these questions, and have made our data publicly available for this purpose. Future research could also expand on these findings by zooming in further on specific variables that may directly or indirectly shape compliance (e.g., by distinguishing essential and nonessential work; by separating individuals from different generations [101] ), or by identifying further variables with which our model could be expanded.",

Indeed, in terms of effect size, people's practical capacity to adhere was the strongest predictor of adherence, by some margin.

In context of social distancing, this has included arrangements that guide crowds through public venues in ways that keep them apart as much as possible, facilitating telework where possible, instituting caps on the number of people able to enter a public space, and so forth. Conversely, authorities can also shape adherence by removing practical opportunities for not following mitigation measures.

Findings from our studies in the Netherlands [18] , however, demonstrate that threat perceptions can quickly recede as infections decline, with deleterious effects on support for, and adherence to, mitigation measures. Accordingly, to sustain adherence to mitigation measures, it is important that authorities do not give the impression that the threat is waning once infections recede [103] .

Although this effect was modest in terms of effect size in the final regression model, effects of social norms on social distancing have also been demonstrated in other research [18, 104, 105] . Authorities thus can enhance adherence to mitigation measures by demonstrating that adherence is common and widely approved of. This also means, however, that authorities should take care to not convey the impression that violations are ubiquitous and normal. It is plausible that in the period after the initial lockdown, highly publicized instances where people widely disregarded social distancing measures may have undermined adherence, by normalizing lack of distancing. To promote adherence to mitigation measures, authorities therefore should express that doing so is the norm (or ought to be), highlight examples where many others are seen to adhere, not draw undue attention to examples where people do not, and to ensure that they are always seen to adhere to the measures themselves.",

The present study brings together a broad range of variables from across these approaches, situated at different levels (i.e., the individual, the social environment, the practical circumstances), and reveals how these together shape adherence in context of social distancing measures. Although the associations that were observed here may not extend beyond this setting, the insight that adherence derived from such a diverse range of influences is nevertheless important for study of compliance. It underlines that to better understand why people comply, research can benefit from a multi-theoretical approach, in which the extant, siloed literatures are brought together and integrated.",

First, although our samples were large and stratified sampled by age, gender, and ethnicity to mimic the demographic characteristics of the United States population based on U.S. Census Bureau data, they remain non-probability convenience samples. Furthermore, there was some variability between the samples in terms of demographics, possibly due to the considerable subset of participants who failed to complete the survey or pass the attention checks. As a consequence, our samples cannot be regarded as truly nationally representative. Nevertheless, there is evidence that such convenience samples can be as accurate as random digit dial telephone surveys [107, 108] , and they may reduce social desirability biases [109] . Further research therefore is needed to understand the robustness of the observed findings, although they align with evidence from other research [3] . Second, our surveys rely on self-reported measures that may be subject to imperfect recall or social desirability bias [110, 111] . We do note, however, that a recent study demonstrated that social desirability bias did not inflate the estimates of compliance with COVID-19 measures in online surveys [112] , and that the finding of high self-reported adherence is in line with objective data from Google COVID19 Community Mobility [113] . Furthermore, prior research shows that there can be strong concordance between self-reported and objective compliance measures when surveys are used (see [78] p. 29). Even so, future research into these questions would benefit from methods that supplement self-reported measures with behavioral data, such as video observation [114] .",

The present findings, based on three stratified samples collected in May, June, and July, show that Americans' adherence to social distancing measures declined, as did several of the factors that sustained it-including people's practical capacity to adhere, their knowledge of the measures, and social norms for adherence. Our research identifies key variables that predicted greater adherence as society reopened, and which contributed to the changes in adherence that were observed thereafter. By doing so, this research contributes to the understanding of pandemic governance and the interaction between rules and human conduct more generally. Moreover, in the current stage of the pandemic, these findings provide important directions for the public health response, by highlighting processes through which adherence to mitigation measures can be promoted, as we strive to return to normality.",
