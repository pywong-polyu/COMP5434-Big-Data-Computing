            "text": "Background: New York City was the first major urban center of the COVID-19 pandemic in the USA. Cases are clustered in the city, with certain neighborhoods experiencing more cases than others. We investigate whether potential socioeconomic factors can explain between-neighborhood variation in the COVID-19 test positivity rate. Methods: Data were collected from 177 Zip Code Tabulation Areas (ZCTA) in New York City (99.9% of the population). We fit multiple Bayesian Besag-York-Molli\u00e9 (BYM) mixed models using positive COVID-19 tests as the outcome, a set of 11 representative demographic, economic, and health-care associated ZCTA-level parameters as potential predictors, and the total number of COVID-19 tests as the exposure. The BYM model includes both spatial and nonspatial random effects to account for clustering and overdispersion. Results: Multiple regression approaches indicated a consistent, statistically significant association between detected COVID-19 cases and dependent children (under 18 years old), population density, median household income, and race. In the final model, we found that an increase of only 5% in young population is associated with a 2.3% increase in COVID-19 positivity rate (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.4 to 4.2%, p = 0.021). An increase of 10,000 people per km 2 is associated with a 2.4% (95% CI 0.6 to 4.2%, p = 0.011) increase in positivity rate. A decrease of $10,000 median household income is associated with a 1.6% (95% CI 0.7 to 2.4%, p < 0.001) increase in COVID-19 positivity rate. With respect to race, a decrease of 10% in White population is associated with a 1.8% (95% CI 0.8 to 2.8%, p < 0.001) increase in positivity rate, while an increase of 10% in Black population is associated with a 1.1% (95% CI 0.3 to 1.8%, p < 0.001) increase in positivity rate. The percentage of Hispanic (p = 0.718), Asian (p = 0.966), or Other (p = 0.588) populations were not statistically significant factors. Conclusions: Our findings indicate associations between neighborhoods with a large dependent youth population, densely populated, low-income, and predominantly black neighborhoods and COVID-19 test positivity rate. The study highlights the importance of public health management during and after the current COVID-19 pandemic. Further work is warranted to fully understand the mechanisms by which these factors may have affected the positivity rate, either in terms of the true number of cases or access to testing.",

ZCTAs were the areas in which patients reported their home address, as opposed to either where they became symptomatic or where they reported for testing/treatment. The area of interest covered 177 ZCTAs within NYC, from 10001 (Chelsea, Manhattan) to 11697 (Breezy Point, Queens). Of these cases, there were 4712 where the patient ZCTA was unknown and thus these cases were discarded, leaving 59,800 cases (92.1% of total cases).

Young dependent population was defined as the percentage of the total population aged under 18. Aged population was the percentage of the total population 65+. These are both typically economically inactive populations. The increased severity of COVID-19 with increasing age has been well documented [13] , and there has been recent evidence of asymptomatic carrier transmission particularly among young people [14, 15] . Males per 100 females was chosen to capture the balance of sex in the population. We were interested in whether sex differences lead to significant variation in detected cases. Some reports suggest a racial disparity in case detection rates across the USA. A report from NYU Furman Center for housing, neighborhoods, and urban policy suggests mortality rates are higher among the city's \"Hispanic, Black, and non-Hispanic/Latino: Other\" populations [16] . For the present study, we initially chose to include the percentage of the population that identify as white (alone or in combination with another race) as a combined indicator of all minority populations. Thus, we united multiple races with distinct levels of COVID-19 incidence [17] into a single metric for model building purposes (i.e., white vs non-white). Then, we also considered a more detailed analysis of the racial structure of neighborhoods by further analyzing five separate racial groups: White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Other (including American Indian and Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islanders, Caribbean, and Mixed Race). Finally, we also included population density based on studies of the 2008 H1N1 Influenza pandemic highlighting population density as a significant risk factor for transmission [18] . The distributions of demographic predictors in the area of interest are shown in Fig. 2 .",

Gini index is a measure of economic inequality ranging from 0 to 1. An index of 0 indicates all the wealth in an area is divided equally among the population, while an index of 1 indicates all the wealth is held by one individual. While some studies have argued against the adverse effects of unequal income [19] , an association has been demonstrated between inequality and population health [20] . We also included household income, which was a significant predictor for hospitalizations in the 2009 influenza pandemic [21] . Specifically, in the present study, we use median household income as a ZCTA-level predictor. Finally, unemployment and poverty both have documented association with health outcomes, including in pandemic scenarios [22, 23] . While there is some level of collinearity between these two variables, we include both as one relates to the economically active labor force whereas the other relates to the total population. The ",

It has been documented that lack of insurance can delay access to timely healthcare, particularly during pandemics [24] . We hypothesized that this parameter could affect virus transmission and/or access to testing, therefore affecting detection rates. Finally, we chose Beds as a parameter related to proximity to healthcare, which has been shown to be inversely associated with adverse outcomes in other geospatial public health studies [25] . For a city containing multiple hospitals such as NYC, we defined a proximity metric in this study as population normalized number of hospital beds within 5 km. This predictor was chosen as a secondary metric reflecting general societal access to healthcare and localized investment in healthcare infrastructure. The distributions of health related predictors in the area of interest are shown in Fig. 4a , b. Figure 4 also shows two other factors used in the model; Fig. 4c shows the number of tests conducted in each ZCTA used as the model exposure, and Fig. 4d shows the neighborhood connectivity between ZCTAs, used for spatial effects.",

            "text": "During the opening stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in NYC, there was considerable variation in detected cases between neighborhoods in the city. Disease mapping shown in Fig. 5 displays a number of high risk areas, notably around Corona, Southeast Queens, East Bronx, and the orthodox Jewish community around Borough Park, Brooklyn. The unprecedented national response included a large number of media stories touting various covariates as predictors of either COVID-19 cases or mortality. In this ecological study, we attempted to use spatial modeling techniques to assess the association between number of COVID-19 cases detected in different neighborhoods of NYC and neighbourhoodlevel predictors. Our findings indicated a significant direct association between detected cases and the proportion of young dependents in the population as well as population density. We also found a significant inverse relationship between detected cases and median household income. We further found a significant positive association between COVID-19 cases and the proportion of the population identifying as black, and conversely, an inverse relationship with the proportion of the population identifying as white. We did not find a consistently significant relationship between detected cases and the other potential predictors; even those such as poverty, unemployment, and lack of insurance that were significant in a univariable model. Our findings indicate statistically significant associations between three of the five demographic predictors included in the study. We find percentage of young dependents in the population to be a statistically significant predictor in all of the models in which it appears as a factor. Conversely, we find that the aged percentage of the population (65+) is not consistently a significant predictor of COVID-19 test positivity rate. This is congruent with evidence from Chan et al. [14] and Bai et al. [15] , both of whom suggest significant transmission by young asymptomatic carriers. We further hypothesize that attitudes and behavioral patterns could play a significant role in this effect. As an example, increasing mortality of COVID-19 with age has been well publicized, and we suggest this may incline older communities to adhere to preventative public-health measures more. Conversely, the same information may be interpreted by younger populations that they are not at significant risk, potentially encouraging riskier behaviors. We found that high density population is a significant predictor of increased COVID-19 test positivity rate. These results support multiple studies of the current pandemic [37] [38] [39] that found that contact rates in well-mixed populations are proportional to population density. In the extreme scenario, the influence of high population density was seen in the rapid spread of the virus on cruise ships, notably the Diamond Princess, in late January 2020 [40, 41] . Hu et al. use kinetic theory of Van der Waals gas models to show that population contact rates increase with population density (to a saturation limit) [42] . These increased contact patterns in higher density neighborhoods, combined with disease transmission through respiratory droplets [43] likely leads to increased positivity rates.",

When we examined race in greater detail, we found significant associations between COVID-19 positivity rate and the proportions of the population identifying as Black (positive association) or White (negative association), but not Hispanic, Asian, or Other. There has been much reporting on Table 4 Regression estimates for models including each one of the five different race categories (one at a time). All models also included young population (Young), population density (Density), and medium household income (Income) as predictors, which were always significant (as they were in the final model reported in Table 3 [17] . The confounding sociological relationships between race and economic affluence are well established [44] , with African Americans more likely to live in densely populated, lowincome neighborhoods, leading to increased contact patterns [45] . Further, the higher incidence of concomitant comorbidities among African American populations (including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease) [46] may lead to an increase in symptomatic cases. Other cohort studies have also shown differences in racial groups that we combined into our Other category [47] . Due to the low number of cases associated with these minority racial populations, we chose not to further divide our race groups, which could increase the risk of ecological fallacy with our aggregate methodology [48] . While the balance of males and females was not consistently significant as a factor, we found some evidence that areas with more males are associated with higher detected COVID-19 cases. Wenham et al. [49] note the lack of sex analysis by global health institutions. Studies have posited sex differences in immunological function [50] or smoking prevalence/pattern [51] as potential causes of differing medical outcomes. We found no studies to date examining sex specific behavior trends in relation to COVID-19 transmission and incidence. Looking back further, we found conflicting evidence from studies on the 2009 H1N1 pandemic. Some studies suggested that females were more willing to engage in public health precautions [52] , while others suggested no significant sex effects [53] . We suggest that further studies be undertaken to consider whether sex specific behavioral, employment, or other trends are mechanisms that could explain sex effects on positivity rates.",

Wen et al. suggest that the presence of affluence sustains neighborhood social organizations, which in turn positively affect health. If we extend this argument to the current pandemic, we could hypothesize that these social organizations further act to pass on information and promote community adoption of transmission-reduction policies such as social distancing [55] . Furthermore, we note that those in low affluence neighborhoods are more likely to live in higher density residence arrangements, for example community housing and shared family dwellings, contributing to transmission of the virus among the neighborhood [40] . While previous studies [56] have found influence of unemployment on disease transmission, we note that the unprecedented shutdown of national infrastructure and the economy has meant that many previously employed people suddenly found themselves either unemployed, furloughed, or working from home. In a short period of time, this drastic measure has completely altered the employment landscape of NYC such that it is unsurprising that the unemployment figure from 2018 is not significant.",

Lack of insurance has previously been a barrier to both diagnosis and treatment [57, 58] . However, in the COVID-19 pandemic, significant state resources were directed such that testing was freely available to all eligible New York residents. Furthermore, testing became freely available to all USA residents on 18 March 2020, as a result of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act (H.R. 6201) [59] . Given the unprecedented free access to testing, it is unsurprising that lack of insurance was not a significant predictor by 5 April when the data were collected. We hypothesize that conducting the same analysis on detected cases prior to 18 March could potentially draw different conclusions about the significance of insurance. Unfortunately, the data on detected cases by ZCTA only became publicly available from NYC DOHMH on 1 April and did not include temporal granularities prior to that date.",

            "text": "We note five key limitations of the ecological study. First, our dependent variable is the number of detected COVID-19 cases, which may be significantly different from the number of true cases [60] . We believe, however, that this does not detract from the validity of the study, since characterization of the detection and prevalence is important for pandemic management [61] . Studies on HIV rates among at risk populations suggest that the relationship between predictors and the number of detected cases is likely a complex interaction via at least three pathways: the true number of cases, access to testing (means) [62] , and population attitudes to testing (motivation) [63, 64] . Thus, we can still develop valid inferences, even if we cannot elicit with certainty which one (or ones) of these pathways the significant predictors act through. This limitation also incorporates natural selection bias in the dependent variable, in that there is a self-selecting group of the population who choose to be tested for COVID-19 (for example due to the presence of symptoms or known contact with an infected person). This group, captured by the total COVID-19 tests, may have different characteristics to the total NYC population (one example could be young people being more likely to get tested). By using the total number of COVID-19 tests as our exposure, we limit the scope to inferences about the test positivity rate, and we further caution that this should not be used as an unbiased estimator of total COVID-19 incidence [65] . Second, any associations made must be interpreted with caution since, as with any observational study, spurious correlations produced by unstudied confounding factors may be present. Caution is also advised due to the ecological fallacy of making individual inferences from aggregate data. Further verification is required to determine true causative links between predictors and detected cases even when associations are significant. Third, the significant predictors found are likely not the only explanations for different positivity rates between different neighborhoods. However, this study does provide useful insight into explaining between-neighborhood variation. Fourth, since testing has been coordinated within the city limits at the borough level, there may be boroughlevel biases related to COVID-19 testing. However, if these biases exist, they likely inhibit testing access in low-income neighborhoods [66, 67] such that the inverse association found between income and positive cases is more pronounced than what the model suggests.",

An argument can be made that, in a highly mixed urban environment such as NYC, this structure, shown in Fig. 4d , does not adequately capture the spatial heterogeneity. However, there is sparse literature on the application of different neighborhood structures to BYM models [68, 69] ; Rodrigues and Assun\u00e7\u00e3o argue that this is primarily due to the ease of nearest neighbor implementation using geographic information systems (GIS) [70] . To investigate the effect of neighborhood mixing, we created an additional series of lagged adjacency matrices from second-through fifth-order implying increasing levels of connectivity. We ran all our model simulations (univariable, multivariable, partial multivariable, stepwise elimination, and our final model) using each one of the five new adjacency matrices, generating 20 new sets of results and associated p values. In all cases (i.e., all neighborhood connectivities), the main study conclusions were unaltered; in particular, young dependent population, race, and income were still significant predictors in all models. The significance of population density however did decline with increased mixing, ceasing to be significant above third-order connectivity in our final model.",

Further, there is also a significant association between COVID-19 test positivity rate and low income neighborhoods. Finally, there is a significant association between neighborhoods with a large percentage of black population or a low percentage of white population and COVID-19 test positivity rate. The significance of young dependents likely comes from differing contact patterns between young and old populations. We suggest further studies to be undertaken to determine any underlying causative mechanisms to these associations, paying particular attention to willingness to engage in public health behaviors and to asymptomatic carrier transmission. We finally highlight that while predictors may change with increased time and access to testing, this study provides important insights into public health behavior in the early stages of the current and future pandemics.
