The aim of this report is to present an unusual case of a severe COVID-19 patient managed at home in a developing country, and to discuss some of the available guidelines and potential therapeutic options for this type of cases. Case presentation: A 60-year-old female seeking medical attention through teleconsultation presents with profound dyspnea, oppressive chest pain, fatigue, episodic hallucinations, and difficulty sleeping, for what she originally sought medical attention at an ER but could not be admitted due to saturation of the health system. A positive PCR test for COVID-19, and a CT scan of the chest showing bilateral consolidations with ground-glass opacities confirmed the diagnosis. The patient was managed at home, with corticosteroids, nitazoxanide and a single dose of 40 mg of subcutaneous enoxaparin. Colchicine was added at the third day of treatment. Standard oxygen therapy through nasal cannula was also recommended. Daily follow-ups were established to monitor for signs of clinical improvement. Two weeks later from the initial consultation the patient presents marked improvement in her symptoms, as well as in her CT scan, which prompted in discontinuation of the medications and the oxygen therapy.",

For the ambulatory care of COVID-19 patients, several aspects of disease management may differ from current guidelines and basic requirements may represent a huge challenge to cover. Further research is needed to assist physicians in the daily clinical decision making, to optimize patient outcomes, and to reduce the probability of adverse scenarios of patients with COVID-19 managed in the ambulatory setting.",

Adding to the already complex scenario are the different responses to the pandemic between countries according to their own strengths and weaknesses, exposing a hard truth: inequality is a threat that will disproportionally hit developing countries [3] . According to a recent report by the World Economic Forum, developing countries suffer from a severe shortage of healthcare workers, as well as a lack of fiscal and monetary capacity to cope with the speed of the pandemic [4] . This in turn leads to a scenario where poverty, overcrowding, and poor public health systems, in combination with the virus, can affect individuals in practically any socioeconomic status and in any society [5] .",

Studies have found that older patients, with associated comorbidities such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, chronic kidney and lung disease, and cancer, are at higher risk for severe and life-threatening disease [6] [7] [8] [9] . In the case of severe patients, there are several agents with demonstrated in vitro activity against COVID-19 used in clinical practice, including hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, interleukin-6 pathway inhibitors, and convalescent plasma; however, to date few agents have proven efficacy against COVID-19 [10] . For instance, a recent preliminary report on the antiviral medication remdesivir, found that it was superior to placebo in shortening the time to recovery among hospitalized adults with COVID-19 with evidence of lower respiratory tract infection, although a reduced mortality benefit was not seen [11] . On the other hand, ambulatory care is usually restricted to patients with asymptomatic to mild disease, and the management is based infection control, and symptomatic relief (e.g. antipyretic medications, and hydration) [12, 13] .",

Despite the fact that they may be prone to bias, several prediction models for diagnosis and prognosis of COVID-19 disease have been proposed with a good to excellent discriminative performance [15] . For instance, a retrospective study comparing 7 score systems developed for patients with community acquired pneumonia showed that A-DROP was the most reliable tool to stratify hospitalized patients by risk of death [16] . However, other publications have shown that even though scores for community acquired pneumonia provide a good source of therapeutic advice, they tend to underestimate viral infections [17, 18] . Other scoring systems, like the quick COVID Severity Index (qCSI), have been designed specifically to identify patients that may undergo respiratory deterioration in 24 of admission, whereas others like the Brescia-COVID Respiratory Severity Scale (BCRSS) algorithm may be easily accessible but not externally validated [19] [20] [21] . In the outpatient setting however, most of these scoring systems are often too technical and complex, requiring variables that are not easily accessible.

In a post hoc analysis including 310 patients with acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, HFNC resulted in a lower intubation rate compared to conventional oxygen therapy (35% versus 53%) and non-invasive ventilation (35% versus 58) [22] . Our patient presented with a SpO2 < 90% at 5-6 L/ min at rest for 4 consecutive days with a low-flow nasal cannula, and despite this poor initial response, the patient had to be kept with conventional oxygen therapy due the unavailability of high-flow nasal devices in the outpatient setting. This unfortunate limitation inclined the management to a more prominent pharmacologic approach.",

In this study, the use of dexamethasone resulted in lower 28-day mortality in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 receiving some form of respiratory support (invasive mechanical ventilation or oxygen alone), compared to patients receiving usual care [26] . It should be noted however, that this benefit was exclusive to patients receiving respiratory support, leading to a change in management from what it was initially proposed by the CDC and the WHO that the use of systemic corticosteroids should be avoided in patients with no evidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). It is uncertain if this patient presented ARDS, however, upon the evidence of deteriorating and progressive disease, she was prescribed with a trial of 3 days of IV methylprednisolone, followed by 7 days of prednisone (40 mg PO). At the time the patient presented with severe COVID-19 disease, the decision was taken considering an observational study including 31 patients with mild COVID-19 disease, where no significant association between viral clearance time and corticosteroid treatment (hazard ratio [HR], 1.26; 95% CI, 0.58-2.74) was reported and indirect evidence in favor of corticosteroids for patients with severe respiratory disease secondary to H1N1 and SARS [27] [28] [29] [30] .",

Currently, besides corticosteroids, no official guideline supports the routine use of immunomodulatory medications outside of the context of a clinical trial. Several agents are under active investigation as possible treatments, including interleukin-1 and 6 receptor blockers. In a small prospective cohort study the use of the interleukin-1 receptor blocker (anakinra) was associated with a reduced need for invasive mechanical ventilation in the ICU and mortality, although there are several limitations of this study that need to be addressed in clinical trials to further support these findings [32] . In the case of the interleukin-6 pathway inhibitor tocilizumab, early observational studies suggest a potential benefit in patients with COVID-19 and elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines (often referred to as \"cytokine storm syndrome\") [33] [34] [35] .",

These mechanisms are responsible for the expansive and complex pharmacodynamics of this drug, where its role as a modulator of cytokine signaling cascades and expression of extracellular mediators and receptors are perhaps of most interest in COVID-19 disease [36] . In a recent open-label, randomized clinical trial, the use of colchicine was associated with an improved time to clinical deterioration when compared to standard of care among hospitalized patients with COVID-19, however no difference was observed among biochemical endpoints between groups [38] . Several terms like \"cytokine storm\", hyperinflammatory or secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis-like syndrome have been extensively applied to describe a late and more severe course of COVID-19 infection, and as an inhibitor of NLRP3 inflammasomes and interleukin activation mitigator, colchicine may represent a viable alternative when tocilizumab is unavailable [39] [40] [41] [42] . As a matter of fact, in the vascular tissue colchicine has shown to downregulate interleukin-1 and tumor necrosis factor alpha which are upstream mediators of IL-6, the main target of tocilizumab [43, 44] . Even though we cannot confirm it, our patient presented abnormally elevated ferritin, D-dimer, CRP, LDH, transaminases and IL-6, all of which are classic characteristics of this hyperimmune state, justifying to a certain extent the rational use of colchicine [45] .",
