Int J Bipolar Disord (2021) 9:4 in humans. Small studies in the 1990s suggested reduced rates of herpes virus infections with lithium (Amsterdam et al. 1990a, b; Amsterdam et al. 1990a, b; Amsterdam et al. 1996) . A retrospective review of 236 patients with affective disorders found that lithium treated patients showed a small reduction of flu-like illness during lithium therapy (Amsterdam et al. 1998) . Lithium is the mainstay prophylactic treatment of bipolar disorder ). Here, we leveraged a Swedish cohort of more than 50,000 patients with bipolar disorder followed over eight years to investigate if lithium treatment is associated with risk of respiratory infections. We employed a within-individual design to circumvent the problem of confounding by indication. With each person serving as his or her own matched control, the within-individual design controls for fixed confounders (e.g., baseline severity of the illness, genetic predisposition, childhood environment) (Lichtenstein et al. 2012 ). To rule out the possibility that a potential association between lithium and respiratory infection rate is secondary to the effect on psychiatric symptoms, we also calculated the association between valproate medication and respiratory infections. Valproate is a commonly used alternative to lithium to prevent mood episodes in bipolar disorder (Cipriani et al. 2013) , recommended by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) when lithium is not suitable (Kendall et al. 2014 ).",

Similar to previous studies , we therefore defined a medication period as a sequence of at least two prescriptions, with no more than three months (92 days) between any two consecutive prescriptions.

Viral infections complicated by bacterial superinfection may, however, warrant specialist care or warrant hospital in-patient treatment. Hence, patients with a viral respiratory infection are likely to be diagnosed with bacterial pneumonia. A systematic review and meta-analysis of 27 studies, including a total of 3,215 patients, found that bacterial coinfection was very common (up to 65%) among patients hospitalized for influenza (Klein et al. 2016) . The authors conclude that bacterial coinfection should always be suspected in all patients with influenza. We therefore defined outcome as being diagnosed with either viral or bacterial respiratory infections. Specifically, the outcomes were defined as influenza or other viral pneumonia (ICD-10 codes: J09, J10, J11.0, J11.1, J12), bacterial pneumonia (ICD-10 codes: J13, J14, J15, J16), pneumonia in other diseases (ICD-10 code: J17.1), pneumonia due to unspecified organisms (ICD-10 code: J18), acute bronchitis (ICD-10 code: J20), acute bronchiolitis (ICD-10 code: J21), and unspecified acute lower respiratory infection (ICD-10 code: J22).

A new period started after a medication switch (i.e., from off medication to on medication or vice versa, for either lithium or valproate) or a respiratory infection diagnosis. For the latter, we restarted the following period at baseline (i.e., to set the underlying time scale as the time since last diagnosis). Lithium and valproate treatment status were defined as time-varying dichotomous exposures. Age band (15-51, 51-64, 64-75, 75-100 years, grouped by the quartiles of the baseline age distribution among those who had an event during the follow-up) was adjusted for as a time-varying categorical covariate. We estimated the hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for respiratory infections during periods with treatment as compared with periods off treatment.

For example, cases treated with lithium or valproate are more likely to have a more severe psychiatric disorder, to smoke, or have other unknown risk factors than cases never treated with any of these drugs. Moreover, cases that had used lithium or valproate were older and were more likely to be male than those who had never used lithium or valproate. The within-individual model that we used compares the risk of respiratory infections during periods with lithium (or valproate) medication with the risk during periods without lithium (or valproate) medication within each individual.

(Amsterdam et al. 1998) Although lithium is believed to act across several biological pathways and the exact mechanism of actions remains obscure (Alda 2015), it is known to inhibit glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) (Malhi and Outhred 2016) . GSK3\u03b2 has been suggested to be involved in inducing apoptosis and release of viral particles in dengue virus-2 infection (Cuartas-Lopez and Gallego-Gomez 2020), and GSK3\u03b2 suppression is hence one potential mechanism underlying the antiviral effect of lithium (Sarhan et al. 2017 ). Lithium has also been found to induce leucocytosis (Carmen et al. 1993; Petrini and Azzara 2012) , and attenuate anti-inflammatory effects during chronic use (reviewed by (van den Ameele et al. 2016)). Further, lithium may stimulate immunoglobulin production in B-lymphocytes, increase T-lymphocyte proliferation, and affect proinflammatory cytokine production (reviewed by (Maddu and Raghavendra 2015) and (van den Ameele et al. 2016)).",

It is well known that valproate can cause reversible bone marrow suppression leading to leukopenia and neutropenia (Acharya and Bussel 2000) . However, a meta-analysis of infectious diseases reported as adverse events during the double-blind phase of placebo-controlled randomized clinical studies failed to show a significant effect of valproate (Zaccara et al. 2017 ). It should be noted, however, that groups treated with lithium or valproate are likely to differ in several respects (Additional file 1: Table S1 ). Lithium is the recommended first treatment option in Sweden, why the group treated with valproate is likely to be less responsive to treatment and might also be a more severely ill group. This is by far the largest study testing the hypothesis that lithium protects against respiratory infections. The within-individual design controls for time-invariant covariates that might confound the results, but the method is susceptible to confounding by factors associated with the exposure that change during the observation period. For example, periods on a mood stabilizer might be associated with better access to healthcare than periods off a mood stabilizer. Although we controlled for this by including valproate in our analyses, it cannot be excluded that time-varying confounding might differ between lithium and valproate. The main limitation is that we cannot discern if lithium protects against viral, bacterial, or other aetiologies. Another limitation is that we lack information on tobacco use and comorbidity, but this should not confound the results in a within-individual model. Limitations finally include the lack of information regarding adherence, but this would if anything be a conservative bias.",
