In humans, eight serotypes have been described worldwide, accounting for 2-9% of acute non-bacterial gastro-enteritis cases in children [2] . AstVs are also responsible for diseases in livestock, poultry, and domestic pets [1] . In wild animals, they have been mostly described in bats ( [3] and in aquatic birds [4] , although detection in other hosts has been reported, such as in marine mammals [5] and in non-human primates [6] . In addition to this large host diversity, the evolutionary history of AstVs is characterized by frequent cross-species transmission events [7] , supporting limited host specificity and a risk of spillover and emergence in humans [8] .",

Detection rates vary greatly depending on the study design and the tested species [3] , and the prevalence of bat shedding AstVs within populations is also highly variable. For instance, we estimated the prevalence of shedding bats ranging from 20% to 81% for Triaenops afer in Mozambique, depending on the time of sample collection [9] . Such a strong seasonality has been reported in both tropical and temperate regions and could be associated to bat population dynamics, in particular in maternity colonies (e.g., an increase in the population size and density during the formation of the colony; [13] ). Body condition and co-infection with other viruses have also been identified to be positively correlated with AstV infection in bats [14, 15] .",

Such a high level of sequence diversity in a single bat species nevertheless contrasts with the low diversity measured for paramyxovirus and Leptospira in the same colony [20] ). Classification of AstV based on host species origin has been largely challenged for the past years [28] because AstVs isolated from different animal species can be genetically similar [9, 11, 21] , but also because genetically different viruses can be isolated from a single species [11, 29] . To improve AstVs classification, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Virus now recommends comparing the AstV RdRp gene to capsid gene sequences [2] , although sequencing of the capsid remains challenging for bat-origin AstVs.",

This result could reflect the limited number of AstV nucleotide sequences available from Molossid bats in public databases, and, more broadly, from bats in tropical areas. Because our study was based on environmental sampling, however, we cannot exclude that the detected viruses came from other hosts than RFTB. As previously mentioned, rats, but also feral dogs (Canis lupus familiaris), and zebu (Bos taurus indicus), have been regularly sighted close to the cave entrance. Avian species such as the house sparrow (Passer domesticus), Madagascar turtle-dove (Nesoenas picturatus), and common myna (Acridotheres tristis) have also been observed near the cave and can be in direct contact with bat guano. Further investigations involving sampling of individual bats and other host species in the vicinity of the cave, as well as sequencing of the AstV capsid gene, could provide information on the level of potential cross-species transmission in this ecosystem.
