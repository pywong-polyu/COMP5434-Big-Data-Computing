A total of 137 fecal specimens from patients with severe HFMD were collected. Enterovirus (EV) types were determined using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), RT nested PCR, and sequencing. Sequences were analyzed using bioinformatics programs. Of 137 specimens tested, 97 (70.8%), 12 (8.8%), and 10 (7.3%) were positive for EV-A71, coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), and CVA16, respectively. Other pathogens detected included CVA2 (2.9%, 4/137), CVA10 (2.9%, 4/137), CVA5 (0.7%, 1/137), echovirus 6 (E6) (0.7%, 1/137) and E18 (0.7%, 1/137). The most frequent complication in patients with proven EV infections was myoclonic jerk, followed by aseptic encephalitis, tachypnea, and vomiting. The frequencies of vomiting and abnormal eye movements were higher in EV-A71-infected patients than that in CVA6-infected or CVA16-infected patients. Molecular phylogeny based on the complete VP1 gene revealed no association between the subgenotype of the virus and disease severity. Nevertheless, 12 significant mutations that were likely to be associated with virulence or the clinical phenotype were observed in the 5'UTR, 2A pro , 2C, 3A, 3D pol and 3'UTR of CVA6. Eight significant mutations were observed in the 5'UTR, 2B, 3A, 3D pol and 3'UTR of CVA16, and 10 significant mutations were observed in the 5'UTR, VP1, 3A and 3C pro of CVA10. In conclusion, EV-A71 is still the main pathogen causing severe HFMD, although other EV types can also cause severe complications.

This study revealed that the number of male patients is higher than that of female patients, the majority of patients with severe disease were under the age of three, and the peak of severe HFMD infections occurred in May.

The predominant pathogen was EV-A71, followed by CVA6 and CVA16 during this period. The current study indicates that the distribution of the main causative agents of severe HFMD in 2014-2018 was similar to that in 2009-2013. No serious cases related to CVB infection were found during 2014-2018 in Shenzhen, but two new EV types, E6 and E18, were found to be associated with serious HFMD infections. Of 592 patients with severe HFMD reported between 2009 and 2018 [3] , 72.3% were infected with EV-A71, 6.3% exhibited CVA6 infections, and 4.9% had CVA16 infections ( Table 6 ). The detection rate of EV-A71 was significantly higher than that of CVA6 and CVA16 in patients with severe HFMD (\u03c7 2 = 869.6442, p < 0.0001). Although EV-A71 was the main pathogen associated with severe HFMD, all of the severe infections caused by it were sporadic cases. The severe HFMD infections caused by other EV types were also sporadic cases, but the number of severe HFMD cases associated with CVA6 and CVA10 infections has increased in recent years in mainland China [5, [8] [9] [10] . Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen surveillance of severe HFMD to prevent outbreaks. Table 4 Possible virulence-or phenotype-associated sites revealed by comparative genomic analysis of 23 CVA16 strains associated with severe HFMD and 20 CVA16 strains associated with mild HFMD The position refers to the complete genome sequence of the CVA16 prototype strain G-10 a The accession numbers for these 13 CVA16 strains are KY425528-KY425540 b Information about these 20 CVA16 strains is shown in More than 10 complications were observed in 494 severe HFMD patients with proven EV infections ( reported that myoclonic jerk is a significant indicator of central nervous system complications in EV-A71-infected HFMD patients [17] , and this was also found in our study. Furthermore, our study showed that myoclonic jerk is also the most frequent complication in severe CVA6 and CVA16associated HFMD. There was no significant difference between the frequencies of serious complications in EV-A71-infected, CVA6-infected, and CVA16-infected patients, except for those of vomiting and abnormal eye movements, which were more common in severe EV-A71-associated disease than in severe CVA6-or CVA16-associated disease, suggesting that vomiting and abnormal eye movements could be used as clinical parameters to distinguish severe EV-A71 and CVA6 or CVA16 serious infections ( Table 6 ). Sequence analysis demonstrated that all of the strains included in this study showed the closest genetic relationship to strains from mainland China. Hence, the EV strains associated with severe HFMD circulating in Shenzhen are considered indigenous strains. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that there is no relationship between the subgenotype of the virus and disease severity. A previous study revealed no association between disease severity and patient gender or age [6] . However, EV displays considerable phenotypic variation. Genome sequence comparisons showed that four variable sites in the 5'UTR, six in the polyprotein region, and two in the 3'UTR are likely to be associated with the virulence or clinical phenotype of CVA6. The four variable sites are located in two functional regions of the 5'UTR: the type I internal ribosome entry site (IRES) element (U306C and C502U) and the hypervariable region (A650C and U707C), which regulate the initiation of viral protein translation [41, 42] . Several studies have shown that variations in multiple sites in the IRES (C158U, 272 and 488) and the hypervariable region (700) of EV-A71 influence its virulence [19, 20] . One variable site (R2K) is located in 2A pro , which performs the posttranslational proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein and also cleaves several host-cell proteins, which promotes the production of new virus particles and allows the virus to evade cellular antiviral immune responses [43] [44] [45] . The residue K at position 68 of 2A pro is more frequently found in severe cases of EV-A71 [41] . Two variable sites (R41K and N48S) are located in the 2C protein, which has ATPase-dependent helicase and ATPase-independent RNA chaperone activity [44, 45] , but no virulence-associated sites have been reported in 2C of EV-A71. Two variable sites (A15T/M/K and V68I) are located in 3A, which interacts with acyl-CoA-binding domain-containing protein 3 (ACBD3) to recruit the lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-\u03b2 (PI4KB) to genome replication sites [44, 45] . There is no virulence-associated site reported in 3A of EV-A71. One variable site (I67L) is located in 3D pol , which functions as a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and plays an important role in changing viral virulence [19, 44, 45] . The I251T variation in the 3D pol of EV-A71 affects viral virulence and temperature sensitivity [20] . Two variable sites (C7U and C27U) are located in 3'UTR, which is involved in negative-strand RNA synthesis and viral translation [46] . Nevertheless, no virulence-associated sites were found in the 3'UTR of EV-A71. When seven variable sites (sites 650 and 707 in the 5'UTR, sites 41 and 48 in 2C, site 15 in 3A, and sites 7 and 27 of 3'UTR) were used in combination as virulence markers, it was possible to identify 80% of CVA6 strains associated with severe HFMD. Four CVA6 strains associated with severe HFMD exhibited consistent differences in seven of 10 variable sites compared with another CVA6 strain associated with severe HFMD. These seven sites probably act synergistically to influence the virulence or clinical phenotype of CVA6. Comparative analysis revealed eight significant sequence differences between 23 CVA16 associated with severe HFMD and 20 CVA16 strains associated with mild HFMD. The two variable sites (C200U and G227A) in the 5'UTR were present in the same nine strains associated with severe HFMD. These two sites might act synergistically to affect the virulence or clinical phenotype of CVA16. This pattern was not observed at other variable sites. One variable site is located in 2B, which is an ion channel protein with two transmembrane domains (TM1 and TM2) [44, 45] . The 2B protein has viroporin activity and contributes to lipid kinase phosphatidylinositol 4-kinase-\u03b2 (PI4KB) recruitment, but its exact function is still unknown. No virulence-associated sites have been reported in 2B of EV-A71. Ten significant differences were observed between five CVA10 associated with severe HFMD and 26 CVA10 strains associated with mild HFMD. Interestingly, four severe CVA10 strains exhibit consistent difference in the above 10 sites compared to the other CVA10 strain associated with severe HFMD. This suggests that these 10 sites probably have a synergistic effect in influencing the virulence or clinical phenotype of CVA10. Four variable sites are located in two functional regions of the 5'UTR: the IRES element (A220G and U423C) and the hypervariable region (G691A and U731C). Two variable sites (V23A and V283I) are located in capsid protein VP1, which determines the antigenicity of the virus and binds to cell receptors and mediates entry into cells [44, 45] . Previous studies have shown that multiple sites or residues in VP1 of EV-A71, including 31G, 31D, L79R, 98K/E, 104D, 107A, Q145E/G/R, 164E, and K244E, are associated with its virulence [20] . Three sites (V15I, G32/D and H33R) are located in 3C pro , which is a cysteine protease and functions like 2A pro [43] [44] [45] . Studies have shown that the variation N69D in 3C pro is associated with the virulence of EV-A71, and variations at residue 79 (T79V/I/A) of 3C pro are associated with the clinical severity and replication efficiency of EV-A71 [47, 48] . Individual variations can therefore potentially change the virulence or clinical phenotype of EV-A71 by affecting viral replication, translation, temperature sensitivity, and interaction with host cells. Hence, we presume that variations in genomes of CVA6, CVA16 and CVA10 influence their virulence or clinical phenotype in the same way they affect EV-A71.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 164, "end": 167, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 634, "end": 637, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1223, "end": 1226, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1227, "end": 1230, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1231, "end": 1234, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1235, "end": 1239, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1967, "end": 1971, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 3096, "end": 3099, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 3618, "end": 3622, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 3623, "end": 3626, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 3792, "end": 3796, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 3797, "end": 3800, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 4099, "end": 4103, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 4104, "end": 4108, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 4109, "end": 4113, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 4206, "end": 4210, "text": "[41]", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 4361, "end": 4365, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 4366, "end": 4369, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 4670, "end": 4674, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 4675, "end": 4678, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 4906, "end": 4910, "text": "[19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 4911, "end": 4914, "text": "44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 4915, "end": 4918, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 5017, "end": 5021, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 5153, "end": 5157, "text": "[46]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 6315, "end": 6319, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 6320, "end": 6323, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 7311, "end": 7315, "text": "[44,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 7316, "end": 7319, "text": "45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 7507, "end": 7511, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 7628, "end": 7632, "text": "[43]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 7633, "end": 7637, "text": "[44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 7638, "end": 7642, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 7871, "end": 7875, "text": "[47,", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 7876, "end": 7879, "text": "48]", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 737, "end": 744, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1340, "text": "Table 4", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2613, "end": 2620, "text": "Table 6", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The main limitation of the comparative genomic analysis of this study is the small number of viral genome sequences compared, especially those of strains associated with severe HFMD.
