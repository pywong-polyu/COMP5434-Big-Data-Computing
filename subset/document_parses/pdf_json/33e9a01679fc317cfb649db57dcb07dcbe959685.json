(2021) critically analyzed the policy responses of Chile in the COVIDoutbreak, including the cancellation and ban of in-person social activities, and implementation of social distancing and stay-home measures that have been widely adopted by other countries during the pandemic. The authors argued that although these policy measures aimed to protect older adults, they may negatively affect their health and wellbeing, especially for those previously living independently and those with comorbidities. The authors acknowledged the limitations of the current health system in Chile and called for a more comprehensive set of national policies to mitigate against COVID-19 and its consequences, including initiatives to revamp the current national long-term care system.",

For example, the lockdown in India was implemented so abruptly that older adults and their caregivers had little time to prepare effectively for it. In this situation, volunteer programs were an effective strategy, however. Roy and Ayalon (2021) found that a pan-India group of volunteers was formed during the lockdown on a popular social media website. These volunteer programs were effective in India when the traditional caregiving options were absent in the lockdown period. The volunteers helped in connecting people of all ages in need of help with those able to offer assistance, with most requests submitted by the relatives of older adults for \"home delivery of essentials\" and \"health needs.\". This study highlights the importance of volunteer programs in meeting needs of older adults in the pandemic for countries lacking old-age specific social or home-and community-based supports and services.",

In addition to these well-documented coping tactics, they adopted a novel strategyrecognizing that the crisis was temporary.",

Zou and colleagues (2021) compared health behaviors mong Chinese older adults living in 60 communities struck by SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) versus those living in 71 communities without outbreaks in the same prefecture areas. The researchers found that those living in the SARS outbreak communities were more likely to participate in regular physical exercises and blood pressure check after the outbreak, relative to those in non-outbreak communities. Although the study did not directly examine health behavior changes during the COVID-19 pandemic, the findings provide suggestive evidence that a comparable change may take place.",

Several studies in this collection suggest that the extent to which ageism intensifies during the pandemic reflects national cultural and political factors. For instance, Xi and colleagues (2021) analyzed social media data during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, and concluded that older Chinese adults had been described positively in this critical period. Conversely, Cohn-Schwartz and Ayalon (2021) found that many Israeli older adults perceived ageism during the pandemic, with nearly one-quarter reporting experiences of age discrimination in the health care system. However, they also found that interpersonal and intergenerational connections and M a n u s c r i p t coresidence with family member could mitigate against ageism and reduced ageist perceptions.",
