It was discussed in the study that 70% of the COVID-19 cluster transmission occurred in particular districts in Oman which had the highest numbers of non-Omani laborers living in very crowded housing area with poor living conditions. Therefore, we may postulate that household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 played great role in contributing to the steady surge of COVID-19 pandemic in the early days of outbreak in Oman.",

Moreover, household transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is very efficient because it can survive up to nine hours on human skin and can remain viable for up to 72 hours on plastic surface and stainless steel within the household confined space. 5 Therefore, overcrowding among non-Omani laborers in small confined houses may play role in worsening the propagation of COVID-19 among them.",
