Results: A total of 102 eligible questionnaires were included. No patient we surveyed reported a diagnosis of COVID-19. Our result showed that 67.86% of patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) and 80.43% of patients with Crohn's disease (CD) were in remission, 85.29%of patients had a good quality of life. Part of the patients (21.57%) reported their disease conditions worsening. The reduction in physical exercise was a risk factor for worsening conditions (OR=17.593, p=0.009). Some patients reported an alteration of medication regimens during the epidemic. Conclusions: The epidemic of COVID-19 might have a certain impact on many aspects of Hubei IBD patients within four weeks after the traffic control. Doctors could utilize the results from our questionnaire to guide IBD patients' self-management. Methods: A questionnaire was designed containing the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI), the 6-point Mayo Score, the short inflammatory bowel disease questionnaire (SIBDQ) and distributed to Hubei IBD patients online within four weeks of traffic control after the outbreak, it also included questions about patients' self-reported disease conditions and their epidemiological features of COVID-19.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "In December 2019, an outbreak of COVID-19 caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) emerged in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei Province, China [1, 2] .

We distributed questionnaires to IBD patients from February 18th to 20th, which is approximately four weeks after traffic control. As of 20 February 2020, there had been 75,465 cases of COVID-19 confirmed in mainland China, including 62,662 cases in Hubei Province. The number of confirmed diagnoses in Hubei Province is 83.03% of that in China, accounting for the majority. At the same time, medical resources had also shifted more towards AGING the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Hubei Province. These factors made routine medical treatment and follow-up of patients with chronic diseases inconvenient. Under these influences, it is essential for patients with chronic diseases to self-manage under the guidance of the doctor in this particular period.
