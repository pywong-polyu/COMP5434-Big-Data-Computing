            "text": "Immunosuppression (IS) and autoimmune disease (AD) are prevalent in patients with severe coronavirus disease 2019 , but their impact on its clinical course is unknown. We investigated relationships between IS, AD, and outcomes in patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Data on consecutive admissions for COVID-19 were extracted retrospectively from medical records. Patients were assigned to one of four cohorts, according to whether or not they had an AD (AD and NAD) or were immunosuppressed (IS and NIS). The primary endpoint was development of severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); secondary endpoints included death, and a composite of mechanical ventilation (MV) or death. A total of 789 patients were included: 569 (72.1%) male, 76 (9.6%) with an AD, and 63 (8.0%) with IS. Relative to the NIS-NAD cohort, patients in the IS-AD cohort had a significantly reduced risk of severe ARDS (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 0.42; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.23-0.80; p = 0.008). No significant relationships between IS or AD status and either death or the composite of MV and death were identified, although a trend towards higher mortality was identified in the IS-NAD cohort (aHR vs NIS-NAD 1.71; 95% CI 0.94-3.12; p = 0.081). Patients in this cohort also had higher median serum levels of interleukin-6 compared with IS-AD patients (98.2 vs 21.6 pg/mL; p = 0.0328) and NIS-NAD patients (29.1 pg/mL; p = 0.0057). In conclusion, among patients hospitalized with COVID-19, those receiving immunosuppressive treatment for an AD may have a reduced risk of developing severe ARDS.",

However, multiple studies have now shown that severe COVID-19 is caused by the development of a hyper-inflammatory state, characterized by dysregulation of the immune system and cytokine storm: the uncontrolled, excessive release of pro-inflammatory T h 1-associated cytokines and chemokines, including interferon-\u03b3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), and CXCL10 [9] . In this sense, COVID-19 has a similar underlying pathophysiology to SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [9, 14, 15] . Thus, several immunomodulatory drugs are being investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 [9, 16] . Other evidence suggests that the pathologic hyperactivity of the innate immune system observed in severe COVID-19 may be caused by a deficit in the adaptive immune response caused in turn by immunosenescence, immunosuppression, or virus-induced lymphopenia [17] . This is suggested by the high levels of IL-6 and IL-10 that are seen in patients with severe disease [18] . The lack of an effective T cell response may hinder viral clearance, allowing a sustained, deleterious innate immune response to develop. This hypothesis is consistent with the observed associations between more severe disease, older age [11] , and lymphopenia [18] .",

In a series of 82 patients with confirmed or highly suspected COVID-19, all of whom had an AD, patients who did not require hospital treatment for COVID-19 were more likely to be on immunosuppressive therapy than those who were hospitalized (76% vs 50%) [19] . In an Italian study, 123 of 784 (15.7%) patients with MS and suspected or confirmed COVID-19, 83% whom were receiving disease-modifying therapy (DMT) for MS, had a severe course of infection [20] ; this was a similar percentage to that reported in the general population [21] . In univariate analysis, the odds of severe COVID-19 were significantly higher in patients not receiving DMT (OR 2.83; p < 0.001), but varied according to the specific drug used in DMT-treated patients. Thus, relative to dimethyl fumarate, a greater risk of severe COVID-19 illness was observed for anti-CD20 therapies (ocrelizumab and rituximab; OR 2.93; p = 0.003), but not for other MS treatments such as interferon-beta, fingolimod, and natalizumab [20] .",

Many patients will have demographic characteristics or comorbidities that modify their risk for severe COVID-19 disease. For this reason, we undertook the present, more complex, study of consecutive admissions to HRC. As expected, we found that patients who were immunosuppressed and had an AD (the IS-AD cohort) had a significantly reduced risk of progressing to severe ARDS relative to those with neither an AD nor immunosuppression. However, no such reduction in risk was seen for immunosuppressed patients who did not have an AD. Indeed, there were proportionately more cases of severe ARDS, and more deaths, in this group than in the NIS-NAD cohort, even after adjusting for sex, obesity, and CCI score.",

In a recent large database study in the UK, malignant disease and solid organ transplantation were associated with significantly elevated risks of in-hospital death among patients with COVID-19 [27] . A possible explanation for our observation, therefore, is that the inherent lymphocyte activation present in AD counteracts the detrimental effect of mild-to-moderate immunosuppression, whereas this does not occur in other immunosuppressed patients. This idea is supported by recent reports of more severe COVID-19 disease and/or higher mortality among patients with immunosuppression related to hematologic malignancy [27] [28] [29] or solid organ transplantation [27, 30, 31] compared to non-immunosuppressed individuals. However, not all studies of COVID-19 in solid organ transplant recipients have found unequivocal evidence of more severe disease and/or an increased risk of death in this population compared with controls [32, 33] .",

Consistent with this, patients in the IS-NAD cohort were more likely to be prescribed tocilizumab than those in other cohorts. Interestingly, however, we did not find significant differences between cohorts in any of the other cytokines measured. Our observations support previous findings suggesting that IL-6 up-regulation may derive from a suboptimal lymphocyte response [17] , and show that adaptive immune cell activation may be beneficial in COVID-19, even if patients are receiving IS treatment. Furthermore, cytokine storm appears to be restricted in patients with COVID-19 to IL-6 production, although a localized increase in IL-1\u03b2 in the lungs cannot be completely excluded.",

Second, although the sample size was large, there was significant imbalance between the cohorts. Three of the cohorts had fewer than 40 patients each, while the NIS-NAD cohort had over 600. Third, the relatively short follow-up time means that some events of interest may have occurred after the cut-off date. Fourth, we selected severe ARDS as the endpoint of interest, but cytokine storm-which we suggest may be abrogated by immunosuppression-has other life-threatening sequelae, including multiple organ failure, cardiac injury, and renal impairment [10, 12, 34, 35] . We did not specifically consider these outcomes. Lastly, standardized care pathways and evidence-based treatment protocols for COVID- 19 have not yet been developed, and differences in the management of the disease could have affected outcomes or introduced bias.",
