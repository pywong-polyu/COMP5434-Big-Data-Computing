Though research has examined how equity holders benefit from the organizational form of franchising, it has not examined the specific role that equity or debt holders play in governing franchise organizations. Additionally, the unique ontology of franchising, which includes semi-internal members of the organization (i.e., franchisees) that invest their own assets and maintain their own balance sheets, provides a rich context for exploring such governance issues. Franchisees exist outside traditional firm boundaries and are not employees, but they are closely linked to the brand given their significant investments in firm-specific assets. Franchisee-based organizations also are growing their own corporate structures and investments in firm-specific assets, sometimes dwarfing those of their franchisor partners. By expanding the concept of governance in franchising, we open avenues for significant scholarship that can enrich both the governance and franchising literatures.

Decades earlier, an opinion piece in the second volume of Industrial Marketing Management (IMM) entitled \"Franchising the ultimate in industrial marketing?\" highlighted the importance of franchising by arguing it is a unique form of distribution, if not its most effective form (Rothenburg, 1973) .

Arguing for a life-cycle model of system-wide dynamics, they began a long tradition in franchising research examining ownership patterns, defined as the choice to distribute via corporate or franchised outlets. Subsequent research has examined the costs and benefits of different distribution structures (e.g., franchised, corporate, plural form) (Bradach, 1997; Cannon, Achrol, & Gundlach, 2000) , the forces driving outlet ownership changes (Dant & Kaufmann, 2003; Dant, Paswan, & Kaufmann, 1996; Windsperger & Dant, 2006) , and the firm's choice to franchise (Lafontaine & Kaufmann, 1994) . This focus on outlet-level ownership and control has helped define the field's view of franchising governance (Yin & Zajac, 2004 ) as a retail distribution channel strategy (Argyres & Liebeskind, 1999; Brown, Dev, & Lee, 2000; Heide, 1994 Heide, , 2003 Hendrikse & Jiang, 2011) , neglecting ownership and governance structures at higher levels of the supra organization. In this view, the franchisor has sole autonomy to design and implement channel structure (Hsu, Kaufmann, & Srinivasan, 2017) in isolation of other factors that may influence strategy, such as financial structures and covenants. As a result, scholarly work in this realm has largely ignored the influence of external equity and debt holders on modern franchise systems. Given the financial crisis spurred by the coronavirus pandemic, we know that a narrow conceptualization of governance fails to acknowledge the enormous impact such entities can have on system structure, function, and survival. The focus of system-wide dynamics research and its attendant debates have evolved to acknowledge the evolution of franchisees from single-unit, \"mom-and-pop\" entities into large enterprises such as publicly traded companies (Lawrence, Pietrafesa, & Kaufmann, 2017) . Nonetheless, a dearth of research exists examining the growth and consolidation of ownership at both the franchisor and franchisee levels (Massimino & Lawrence, 2019) , leaving many interesting avenues and topics for future research. For example, franchise organizations can be owned by cooperatives (e.g., Best Western, Ace Hardware, Coop), private equity firms (e.g., Roark Capital, Bain Capital), publicly traded companies (e.g., Domino's Pizza, McDonald's), families (e.g., Chick-fil-A, Enterprise Holdings Inc., H&M), or foundations (IKEA Interogo). These structural characteristics, in turn, influence the organizations' debt and equity positions and their risk profiles. A private equity owner, for example, may leverage the debt of its investment portfolio. Chick-fil-A, a family-owned firm, mandates closure on Sundays, limits franchise partners' unit growth, and has no significant debt obligations. Despite the impact of the franchisor on the network's structural dynamics (Patel, Kim, Devaraj, & Li, 2018) , including debt and equity levels, we are unaware of any literature that acknowledges this in the broader franchise governance framework. We contend these high-order ownership and governance characteristics warrant consideration given their implications for the unique ontology of franchising (Dant, Gr\u00fcnhagen, & Windsperger, 2011) , one that includes ownership redirection, the stable plural forms thesis, and the growth of multi-unit franchising.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 32, "end": 58, "text": "Oxenfeldt and Kelly (1969)", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 504, "end": 519, "text": "(Bradach, 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 520, "end": 553, "text": "Cannon, Achrol, & Gundlach, 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 600, "end": 623, "text": "(Dant & Kaufmann, 2003;", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 624, "end": 655, "text": "Dant, Paswan, & Kaufmann, 1996;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 656, "end": 681, "text": "Windsperger & Dant, 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 719, "end": 748, "text": "(Lafontaine & Kaufmann, 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF65"}, {"start": 861, "end": 879, "text": "(Yin & Zajac, 2004", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 924, "end": 952, "text": "(Argyres & Liebeskind, 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 953, "end": 977, "text": "Brown, Dev, & Lee, 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 978, "end": 989, "text": "Heide, 1994", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}, {"start": 990, "end": 1003, "text": "Heide, , 2003", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1028, "text": "Hendrikse & Jiang, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF48"}, {"start": 1211, "end": 1246, "text": "(Hsu, Kaufmann, & Srinivasan, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1942, "end": 1982, "text": "(Lawrence, Pietrafesa, & Kaufmann, 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 2123, "end": 2151, "text": "(Massimino & Lawrence, 2019)", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 2969, "end": 3002, "text": "(Patel, Kim, Devaraj, & Li, 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF80"}, {"start": 3297, "end": 3335, "text": "(Dant, Gr\u00fcnhagen, & Windsperger, 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "This expanded perspective on franchise ownership dynamics foregrounds corporate governance, which we define as the system of laws, rules, and factors that control operations at a company (Gillan & Starks, 1998) .

Such a view has widened the scope of corporate governance to consider the role owners and equity market owners could play in firm governance (Aguilera & Crespi-Cladera, 2012; Gillan, 2006) . Franchising is a distinctive realm for studying corporate governance because its agreements are unique contractual arrangements between an independent, business-owning franchisee and a brand-owning franchisor. Franchisees also invest significant assets into the franchise system under term-limited contracts, though many have multi-generational brand commitments. Their significant financial investments in firm-specific assets tie them firmly to the brand despite their existence outside traditional firm boundaries. In other words, a franchisee may consider himself an independent contractor but he is one who \"cloaks himself in the identity of the franchisable trademark\" (Caves & Murphy, 1976, p. 572) .

First, capital allocation and reinvestment in the system remains a primary board concern, namely decisions on cash distributions to shareholders and stakeholders such as franchisees. In franchise systems with limited or no corporate owned outlets the decision to invest capital at the outlet level for remodelling and expansion remains a franchisee decision but often regulated by contractual arangements for remodeling or growth. One important board decision is the corporate-and franchise-owned mix, which can have implications for both returns and risk Table 2 Related articles in the field of franchising and corporate governance.

Though some have argued that plural-form structures provide a strategic benefit (Bradach, 1998) , leading industry firms are rapidly shifting toward a greater percentage of franchised outlets (Lawrence et al., 2017) . Second, incentive incompatibly (Blair & Kaserman, 1994) remains an important decision-making factor because system-wide sales motivate franchisors while unit-level profitability motivates franchisees. A board, therefore, may focus on system growth instead of unit-level profitability, which could spark tensions with franchisees investing capital at the outlet level. Examining such tensions in the context of franchise-based organizations, as well as the representation of key stakeholders (e.g., franchisees) on boards, would contribute to a greater understanding of franchise governance. Given the number of private equity investors that own multiple brands (e.g., Roark Capital), board composition remains an important avenue of future inquiry. Third, franchisees remain small-business owners primarily interested in until-level performance, not corporate-level metrics such as stock price. Unlike most corporate structures where employees may be rewarded through stock options, franchisees that invest significant amounts of their own equity have little interest in corporate profits or rising stock prices.

Significant contributions could be made to this field by exploring how debt and equity partners work to govern a franchise system. Property rights, for example, are sanctioned behavioral relations among decision makers for the use of valuable resources within a given parameter. This definition stresses both the legal and social components of property rights and characteristics that govern behavior-among them, corporate culture and reputation (Ostrom, 1990) . Research by Konigsberg (1991) and Jell-Ojobor and Windsperger (2014) examines franchising-specific structures and how they differ with regard to control and governance. Among the four structures examined, the studies contend that joint ventures have lower control than a wholly owned subsidiary but higher control than area development franchising and master franchise agreements. Previous work has found that franchising firms' governance structures are seen as working together usefully for decision rights and ownership rights, while the dual distribution does not depend on heterogeneous downstream outlets (Hendrikse & Jiang, 2011; Windsperger & Yurdakul, 2007) . The relationship between ownership rights and residual decisions in franchising companies, however, remains under-researched. According to Baker, Gibbons, and Murphy (2008) , a firm's governance structure refers to decision and ownership rights. In franchising, decision rights encompass the assignment of rights for use of system-and outlet-specific assets in contracts. In other words, ownership rights in franchising are seen in the ratio of company-owned to franchisee-owned stores and residual income rights, as traditionally conceptualized in Fig. 1 .

One short-term route to improving private equity groups' returns on assets is to sell existing company-owned units to new or existing franchisees, otherwise known as refranchising. Returns from franchising through royalties are significantly higher than company-owned store margins (Siebert & Leonesio, 2015) .

Firms have other ways to return value to shareholders, including stock buybacks.

This potential competing interest over capital allocation has important implications for franchise system management but has not been discussed in the literature. Instead, research historically has framed the conflict in franchising as one between sales and profits, even when capital allocation and reinvestment potentially may be primary drivers of system performance. When the owner of a company is establishing or governing a franchise system, the owner must make governance decisions on the optimal ownership and effect of capital structure-for example, redirecting capital from outlet ownership. A gap exists today in the corporate governance and franchising literatures surrounding the understanding of how such governance decisions affect performance. Addressing this gap could spur interesting research questions such as: 1) How does franchise system ownership affect longand short-term strategic and capital plans? 2) How does capital allocation when reinvesting in the future of a franchised business differ from that of a non-franchise brand? 3) How does ownership concentration affect system-wide performance?", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Ownership redirection to capital redirection"}, {"text": "Stable plural form theory (Bradach, 1997) argues that both company-owned and franchised outlets existing in singular systems accrue certain system-wide benefits.
