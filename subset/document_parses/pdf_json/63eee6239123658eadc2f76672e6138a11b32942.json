A literature search of the MEDLINE, EMBASE, PubMed, and the Cochrane Library database was conducted. Meta-analyses were carried out comparing restrictive and liberal transfusion strategies. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the basis of cyanotic status. Five randomized controlled trials with a total of 497 children were included. There was no significant difference in the risk of in-hospital mortality between the two transfusion strategies (risk ratio 1.21; 95% confidence interval 0.49 to 2.99; P = 0.68). The trial sequential analysis suggested that the current meta-analysis had an absence of evidence for in-hospital mortality, and the data were insufficient. Moreover, no significant differences existed between groups in terms of risk of infection, blood loss, duration of mechanical ventilation, pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) stay duration, or hospital stay duration. Cyanotic children treated with a liberal transfusion strategy had a shorter ventilator duration, but the transfusion strategy did not affect in-hospital mortality, infection, hospital stay, or PICU stay duration. On the basis of the available data, our analysis indicates that a liberal transfusion strategy did not lead to a better outcomes, but the data are extremely sparse, which highlights the need for clearer transfusion guidelines specific to this specific population.

Cyanotic and non-cyanotic children have significantly different tolerances to hypoxia, and their needs for blood transfusion are different. Moreover, pediatrics patients with unstable cardiac disease or cyanotic cardiac disease may benefit from a more liberal transfusion strategy [14] . Research shows that the proportion of cyanotic children who received blood transfusion and underwent cardiac surgery was up to 90%, compared to 65% of non-cyanotic children [15] . Therefore, the transfusion strategy for pediatrics patients undergoing cardiac surgery remains controversial and inconclusive, especially in cyanotic and non-cyanotic children.

The funnel plot suggested that there was no publication bias, which was also statistically supported by the results of Egger's test (P = 0.96) and Begg's test (P = 0.60). A total of 390 children (198 children who received restrictive RBC transfusion and 192 those who received liberal RBCs transfusion) were analyzed altogether; there was no difference in in-hospital mortality was observed between the 2 groups (RR 1.21; 95% CI 0.49 to 2.99; P = 0.68; I 2 = 0%), with 9 (4.55%) deaths in the restrictive group and 7 (3.65%) deaths in the liberal group ( Fig. 3 ; Table 2 ). A high quality of evidence was observed as assessed using the GRADE method. Figure 4 presents the TSA for the fixed-effect meta-analyses of in-hospital mortality. TSA revealed that the required information size was 6671 patients. The cumulative z-curve did not cross the conventional boundary for benefit or the trial sequential monitoring boundary for benefit. The TSA evaluations suggested that this meta-analysis had an absence of evidence for this outcome, and the data were insufficient. Data for the effect of restrictive versus liberal transfusion strategies on infection risk were reported in three RCTs [21, 23, 24] . The pooled RR indicated no significant difference between groups in the incidence of infection (RR 1.18; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.92; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.48) ( Table 2 ).

A subgroup analysis published by Willems stated that a restrictive RBC transfusion strategy applied in pediatric cardiac surgery patients, compared to a liberal strategy (hemoglobin threshold of 9.5 g/dL), was not associated with any significant difference in multiorgan dysfunction syndrome or PICU stay duration [21] . A previous meta-analysis examined the effects of restrictive versus liberal transfusion thresholds on clinical outcomes in very low birth weight infants and demonstrated that restrictive transfusion thresholds may be utilized without increasing the risk of death or morbidity [26] . However, these studies focused on non-cardiac surgery, the results of which cannot not be generalized to pediatric cardiac surgery patients. Therefore, the current meta-analysis was conducted with a focus on pediatric cardiac surgery patients. It was revealed that restrictive RBC transfusion strategy did not increase the risk of in-hospital mortality, incidence of infection, blood loss, or prolong LOS or PICU stay, and that this strategy decreases the number of transfusions required. Moreover, considering that blood transfusion may have different effects in cyanotic and non-cyanotic children, we performed a subgroup analysis; the results showed that blood transfusion strategies did not affect postoperative outcomes in cyanotic and non-cyanotic children, except that the cyanotic children treated with a liberal transfusion strategy had a shorter ventilator duration. On the other hand, TSA analysis, using the defined model described in the Methods section, showed that the number of participants did not reached the RIS, and the cumulative z-curve did not cross the conventional boundary or trial sequential monitoring boundary. Therefore, TSA showed an absence of evidence for these outcomes, i.e., it is impossible to draw any conclusion from these results, unless more high-quality and large sample sizes studies are available.",

Nonetheless, we believed that this is a complex group of patients who may need specialized blood management [15] . The limited sample size may have also contributed to this negative finding. This possibility should be explored further. Cyanotic children have been traditionally transfused to maintain the hematocrit level above 40% [15] . Data showed that the blood-transfused proportion of cyanotic children who received cardiac surgery was 85.4-90%, compared with 65-73.7% of similarly treated non-cyanotic children. Great variability remains among physicians regarding the hemoglobin levels and the \"ideal\" threshold for transfusion, especially in cyanotic children [15, 27] .

Children with cyanotic congenital heart disease present with hemoglobin concentrations as high as 22.0 g/ dL, which is a rare occurrence in adults [7] . Children with cyanotic heart disease deserve special consideration in relation to tolerable levels of anemia. Mink and Pollack [28] wrote that critically ill children with uncorrected cyanotic congenital cardiopathy should undergo transfusion if their hemoglobin concentration falls below 10.0 or 11.0 g/dL. Most textbooks on pediatric cardiology and pediatric cardiac surgery recommend that a higher hemoglobin concentration should be maintained in children with uncorrected cyanotic congenital cardiopathy. However, all thresholds are based on expert opinion, given that there are no randomized clinical trials and very few clinical, physiological, and observational studies in this very distinct pediatric population. Indeed, clinical observations from bloodless cardiac operations for the treatment of congenital heart diseases suggested that lower levels of hemoglobin may be tolerated well, even in children with cyanotic cardiopathy [7] . As stated by Bratton and Annich in 2003, the optimal hemoglobin levels remain understudied in cyanotic patients [29] . To conclude, there is no consensus regarding the hemoglobin concentration that should lead a physician to prescribe an RBC transfusion to critically ill children.",

Despite the limited evidence, there are many guidelines for the transfusion practices in children [7, 30] . However, many experts do not recommend a specific threshold hemoglobin level, especially in the pediatric cardiac surgery patients [30] . Hence, an appropriate transfusion strategy is necessary to know the threshold for transfusion to avoid tissue hypoxia in pediatric cardiac surgery patients. Unfortunately, we did not know the transfusion threshold for each individual. Practice guidelines for perioperative blood transfusion and adjuvant therapies reported by the American Society of Anesthesiologists suggest that the threshold of transfusion needs to be defined precisely, and they strongly agreed that the perfusion and oxygenation of vital organs should be continuously monitored to avoid tissue hypoxia [31] . Pediatric cardiac surgery is associated with a substantial risk of bleeding and frequently requires transfusion. Efforts to optimize pre-operative hemoglobin, reduce bleeding, improve hemostasis, correct coagulopathy, and incorporate blood-sparing techniques (including a restrictive transfusion strategy) are key elements to blood management in the pediatric cardiac surgery population. Thus, the decision on whether to transfuse should be guided by an assessment of the individual patients on the basis of a combination of symptoms, clinical and physiological signs, cyanotic or non-cyanotic status, and laboratory measurements, rather than by a single factor, such as of hemoglobin level or threshold. Regretfully, we searched the Clinical Trial Registry and found no ongoing high-quality randomized controlled trials on the effects of restricted and liberal blood transfusions on pediatric cardiac Fig. 3 In-hospital mortality surgery in randomized controlled trials conducted on pediatric cardiac surgery patients surgery; therefore, future studies focusing on such patients are warranted.",

            "text": "The limitations of this meta-analysis should be mentioned. First, the triggers for transfusion strategies varied among the RCTs. Thus, the appropriate transfusion threshold remains to be explored. Second, the age, sex, comorbidity conditions, complications in PICU, hemoglobin prior to surgery, hemoglobin value on admittance to PICU, status of children in restrictive and liberal groups, as well as cyanotic and non-cyanotic subgroups, were not known. Furthermore, ventilation times were lower in cyanotic children who received a liberal transfusion, but this was not shown in non-cyanotic children, with I 2 = 99% for the latter group but 0% for the former group. Further analysis found that their studies conducted by different groups in the non-cyanotic group, and only two studies in the cyanotic group, with both the latter studies from the same study group but different populations. These differences indicate that different surgical centers play an important role in the outcome of pediatric patients after surgery rather than just blood transfusion strategies alone. Therefore, further high-quality RCTs should be performed. Third, we could not provide more information about postoperative complications after RBC transfusion in pediatric cardiac surgery. Fourth, the sample sizes of the analyzed RCTs were too small; hence, our meta-analysis may be subject to small study effect bias, and the results should be interpreted with caution. Fifth, the target hemoglobin in transfusion and the duration of blood storage could have an effect on postoperative mortality and morbidity; however, we could not elucidate any effects using the current data [19, 32, 33] . Finally, at what degree of anemia in children do the benefits of RBC transfusion outweigh its risks remains unclear due to the lack of clinical evidence to address this question [7] .",
