It is a patient-made 2 umbrella term for this condition, which may involve multiple pathologies. The underlying mechanisms are still largely unknown, but hypotheses include inflammatory or autoimmune processes, organ damage and scarring, hypercoagulability, endothelial damage, or even persistent viral protein in the body 3,4 . Based on the UK Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates, the prevalence of Long COVID is around 1 in 7 people at three months from the infection, and it is most common in working-age adults, but also occurs in other age groups, including children 5 . More recent ONS figures indicate that there are 376,000 people in the UK who have had Long COVID for at least one year 6 . It has a wide range of symptoms, but the most common are exhaustion, breathlessness, muscle aches, cognitive dysfunction, including poor memory and difficulty concentrating, headache, palpitations, dizziness and chest tightness or heaviness. The nature of the symptoms is mostly relapsing, resulting in significant dysfunction and limitations in a relatively large proportion of sufferers 6,7 .",

My acute illness was not severe, so I did not go to hospital, as the medical advice at the time was to isolate at home, and that, like flulike illness, one would be completely recovered within a week or two. This also meant I did not have access to testing to confirm infection, as community testing stopped in the UK on March 12, 2020 8 . Although I felt improvements, the illness did not go away after several weeks. Some of my symptoms, the chest heaviness, muscle aches, and fatigue, remained fluctuating for months, while new symptoms, such as palpitations, also appeared. Every time I felt it was almost over, symptoms came back. I started recognising and avoiding some of the activities that triggered the symptoms, but I could not always work out what caused the relapses.",

It was somewhat reassuring that so many others were posting similar stories on social media, but it was a struggle to get Long COVID recognised by governments and national health agencies as a serious problem back then. It seemed nobody had thought about the enormous implications of chronic disease as a result of letting SARS-CoV-2 spread through the community, assuming it would all be fine for those classed as non-vulnerable. As I wrote in a previous piece 'death is not the only thing to count in this pandemic, we must count lives changed' 9 . I urged public health agencies to quantify and define Long COVID 10,11 .

This includes genuine patient involvement in all stages of science and healthcare design, but may also include us wearing the two hats of patient and expert. Unfortunately, a lot of healthcare professionals and health scientists across the world caught SARS-CoV-2 with many suffering the consequences of Long COVID. In the UK, 3.6% of all healthcare staff were estimated to have Long COVID 5 . The experience of the illness not only brings deep understanding and appreciation of its real-life impact, but also of the questions that need answering 12 . People with lived experience must have a central role in shaping the research and services agenda because they are experts in living with the disease. Even with substantial patient involvement in shaping care and research, some sections of society will always have more representation in decision-making forums than others. Therefore, without seeking insight and input from those usually unheard, our response will always be inadequate.",

We have always been better at measuring the acute over the chronic, but it is the latter that has the most long-lasting impact on societies. At the beginning of the pandemic, long-term illness and ensuing disability due to COVID were completely dismissed and did not shape policy decisions. This is partly because they were not adequately quantified, and the models informing policy and public opinion used short-term outcomes of hospitalisation and death. It is disheartening to still frequently see recovery confused with short-term survival or hospital discharge. We need systems to record recovery and continued illness following infection, accurately and universally. Disease registers have been employed for other chronic conditions such as cancer and could prove very valuable for Long COVID as well as other post-viral illnesses.",

Long COVID has been predominately pictured as something that mainly ails middle-aged women. However, the difference in the prevalence between women and men seems relatively small (15% vs 13% according to ONS estimates 5 ). Women have experienced not being believed about their symptoms with other similar chronic conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome and fibromyalgia 13 . This has the potential to lead to stigma and institutional discrimination 14 . When the dismissal of concerns and symptoms by service providers and employers is compounded by demographic, ethnic, social, and economic pre-existing structural disparities, the injustice is exacerbated. The stigma can become internalised potentially depriving people with lived experience of Long Covid from recognition, support, and services because they do not want to face the dismissal, disbelief, and denial. We must not repeat past mistakes of stereotyping and pushing those already disadvantaged away from seeking help.",

Science on the topic is evolving and case definitions will need to be frequently updated, but we cannot afford to wait. People living with Long COVID need proper clinical assessments, medical investigations, and a diagnosis. A diagnosis is necessary not only for treatment and rehabilitation purposes, but also to maintain livelihoods. Without it, people with what are considered 'unexplained symptoms' may lose out on employment rights and benefits, leading to financial hardship that can exacerbate their illness. The diagnosis could simply be an umbrella term like Long COVID that encompasses some uncertainty about how it manifests. A case definition for research can be more stringent than that for the purpose of surveillance. Criteria used for clinical diagnosis must be the most inclusive because people's lives depend on them (11) . The case definitions must be based on clinical assessment and not be dependent on laboratory tests, since there is a range of problems with these, including access, affordability, and accuracy.",
