A crucial novel feature of our approach is that it significantly takes into account that an epidemic may take place in certain types of waves which cannot only be of a global as well as local nature, but can also occur at multiple different times and locations. In the particular case of the current Covid-19 pandemic, based on recent figures from the Johns Hopkins database we apply our model to France, Germany, Italy, the Czech Republic, as well as the US federal states New York and Florida, and compare it and its predictions to established as well as other recently developed forecasting methods and techniques.",

In [9] , the authors present three basic \"macroscopic\" models to fit data emerging from local and national governments: exponential growth, self-exciting branching process and compartmental models. The compartmental models are the classical SIR and SEIR models; the self-exciting branching process has been used before with regard to treating Ebola disease outbreaks and other dynamics of social interaction. In the exponential growth model, the number I(t) of infectious individuals at time t is expressed as I(t) = I 0 e \u03b1t , where \u03b1 is the rate constant. The exponential growth model is related to our approach, in which the exponential function is modelling the reported infections. However, as this is a one-parameter model, it works only well for fitting the data at the beginning of an outbreak.",
