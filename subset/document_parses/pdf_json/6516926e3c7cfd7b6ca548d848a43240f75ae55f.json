            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 has triggered an enormous number of discussion topics on social media Twitter. It has an impact on the global health system and citizen responses to the pandemic. Multiple responses (replies, favorites, and retweets) reflect the followers' attitudes and emotions towards these tweets. Twitter data such as these have inspired substantial research interest in sentiment and social trend analyses. To date, studies on Twitter data have focused on the associational relationships between variables in a population. There is a need for further discovery of causality, such as the influence of sentiment polarity of tweet response on further discussion topics. These topics often reflect the human perception of COVID-19. This study addresses this exact topic. It aims to develop a new method to unveil the causal relationships between the sentiment polarity and responses in social media data. We employed sentiment polarity, i.e., positive or negative sentiment, as the treatment variable in this quasi-experimental study. The data is the tweets posted by nine authoritative public organizations in four countries and the World Health Organization from December 1, 2019, to May 10, 2020. Employing the inverse probability weighting model, we identified the treatment effect of sentiment polarity on the multiple responses of tweets. The topics with negative sentiment polarity on COVID-19 attracted significantly more replies (69\u00b149) and favorites (688\u00b1677) than the positive tweets. However, no significant difference in the number of retweets was found between the negative and positive tweets. This study contributes a new method for social media analysis. It generates new insight into the influence of sentiment polarity of tweets about COVID-19 on tweet responses.",

It has a significant, [4] . The disease burden of the pandemic unavoidably impacts population health and well-being, health resource utilization, social dynamics, world economies, and health technology development. Stakeholders around the world (i.e., governments, non-profit organizations, and healthcare communities) have taken active actions to respond to the COVID-19 epidemic. Unsurprisingly, the COVID-19 pandemic has been triggering massive short informal texts on Twitter, expressing public anxieties, worries, and a new byproduct of discrimination [5] . Therefore, understanding and drawing insights from the massive number of social media posts, i.e., Tweets, has never been more critical. This understanding will assist in designing public health programs or events on social media to correct misinformation and overcome the current fear and stigma about COVID-19 globally. For example, the World Health Organization (WHO) tweeted on February 28, 2020 \"everyone should know the #COVID19 symptoms?. . . Most people will have mild disease and get better without needing any special care.\" This tweet provides the domain knowledge about COVID-19 symptoms to the public and attracts positive sentiment. On March 11, 2020, WHO also tweeted, \"some countries are struggling with a lack of capacity (resources, resolve)\". This tweet shows WHO's negative sentiment (i.e., concern) about these countries' capacity to prevent, monitor, and control COVID- 19. Sentiment analysis is also known as opinion or emotion artificial intelligence [6] . It refers to the use of natural language processing (NLP), text analysis, computational linguistics, and machine learning to systematically analyze people's written language [7] . This result of sentiment analysis is acquired people's opinions, sentiments, evaluations, attitudes, and emotions. Sentiment analysis has been widely applied to draw insights from social media posts. It aims to determine the polarity of a piece of text as positive, negative, or neutral. Methods for these analyses often include counting the number of positive and negative words to determine the document's sentiment polarity. These methods often employ a dictionary of words with an assigned sentiment value, such as the lexicon of AFINN in the tidytext package [8] . The terms in AFINN are assigned scores from -5 to 5, with a negative score indicating negative polarity and positive polarity.",

To date, few studies have examined the impact of a tweet's sentiment polarity (SP) on its responses (i.e., replies, favorites, and retweets). This study aims to fill this gap. We investigated the influence of sentiment polarity on the responses to COVID-19 in Twitter and examine the hypothesis: negative sentiment on COVID-19 will attract more responses in terms of replies, favorites, and retweets than positive sentiment. We conducted a quasi-experimental study on the publicly available Tweet data published between December 1, 2019, to May 10, 2020. These data were extracted using the keyword \"coronavirus\" or \"COVID.\" The research method used is an innovative, causality discovery approach instead of the often-used association relationship.",

Quasi-experimental research provides a feasible and low-cost approach to identify the treatment effect of sentiment polarity [17] [18] [19] [20] . Therefore, studies of the treatment effect of social media, i.e., Twitter, mainly implement a quasi-experimental study design to examine the causal effect of a Tweet's sentiment polarity. For example, using a fixed-effect model, Mousavi et al. addressed potential endogeneity in the 111th U.S. senators' Twitter adoption decisions in 24 months [20] . They used the method of propensity score matching [21] and difference-in-differences approaches [22] to identify causal relationships of lawmakers' voting orientations. Semiparametric estimation can also be employed for inference about the treatment effect when treatment intake is likely not randomized [23] .",

Many factors, such as the number of tweets, average document (tweet) length, and the number of discovered events/topics, are applied as the covariates in the temporal mining of micro-blog texts [24] . For COVID-19 related studies, Pan et al. employed other external features (i.e., confirmed cases and deaths due to COVID-19) as the covariates for a public health intervention study [25] . Although there are some drawbacks (i.e., high signal-noise ratio) with the covariates from tweet features, the bias [26] could be quantified through the process of covariate balance with inverse probability weighting [21] . Terry investigated the critical differentiator for social media [27] . On choosing the study population of tweets, Terry chose professional journalists (or other paid content providers) and ordinary, common users. In Terry's terms, the content created by professional users or other paid content providers is different from that generated by common users without professional training, thus the former should be given higher weight.",

Their study suggests that Twitter mining is useful to inform public health education. Moreover, a systematic review also suggests that there is an essential need for an accurate and tested tool for sentiment analysis of tweets using a health care setting [30] .

The news agencies are The Australian (australian), China Daily (CDaily), BBC in the UK, and CNN in the US. These four agencies are the most popular, with a massive number of followers on the Twitter platform from the four countries. The reasons for including the news agencies along with government organizations lie in two aspects. First, news agencies were often employed in the literature to investigate the social media impact on an emergent event, e.g., the use of social media in the Westgate mall terror attack in Kenya [33] . Second, this paper employed the news agencies that are the representative media account on the Twitter platform from the four countries.

Therefore, we conducted a quasi-experimental study to answer the research question (i.e., what is the treatment effect of sentiment polarity on tweet responses). Sentiment polarity (SP) is inferred from the Tweet responses (replies, favorites, and retweets) and used as the treatment variable, with two levels (positive or negative). Thus, the population (weekly tweets) is divided into negative and positive groups by this treatment variable. This quasi-experimental study is aimed at estimating the causal impact of the intervention (SP) on the target population without random assignment. Fig 1 presents the research framework.",

The stability of statistical results is relative to reasonable perturbations to data and the model used. The following results with bootstrap (parameter n = 500) show the stability of the differential effect of sentiment polarity on the responses to the weekly tweets. T-test result suggests that the differences in responses to the tweets with negative and positive sentiments are significant for replies (p = 0.001) and favorites (p = 0.029) but not significant for retweets (p = 0.405). Thus, we can reject the null hypothesis (on replies and favorites) and accept the corresponding alternative hypothesis (the negative sentiment polarity impacts the response rates of replies and favorites). The results suggest that there are true differences in RP and FV between the negative and positive tweets. Meanwhile, we can accept the null hypothesis and reject the corresponding alternative hypothesis on retweets, with no differences between the negative and positive tweets' impacts on the response rate of retweets. Therefore, the differential effect of treatment shows the influence of sentiment polarity on the responses of Twitter within COVID-19 data. Sentiment polarity has a negative effect on the replies and favorites of the tweets. The negative topics on COVID-19 have more replies and favorites than those positive topics for both organizational and media tweets.
