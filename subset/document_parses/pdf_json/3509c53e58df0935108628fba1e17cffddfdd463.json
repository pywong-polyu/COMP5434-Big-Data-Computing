The 2017 European Leukemia Net (ELN) criteria are the most widely used risk model and stratifies patients into three prognostic groups: favorable, intermediate, and adverse. 3 Unfortunately, there are many gene mutations which are not currently characterized in this model that may have a significant impact on prognosis such as NRAS/KRAS or DNMT3a mutations. [4] [5] [6] Recent advances using targeted therapy in patients who are not candidates for intensive induction chemotherapy and who have relapsed or refractory disease have shown response rates of 20-60%. 1, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Despite the progress made in cancer detection, treatment, and survival, patients from rural Appalachia continue to have higher incidence of cancer diagnosis and cancer-related mortality compared to patients from non-Appalachia. [12] [13] [14] Although the gap in incidence of cancer has narrowed, patients from Appalachia continue to have increased rates of tobacco-related cancers, specifically lung cancer, oral cavity cancer, pharyngeal cancer and cancer of larynx. 15 In Virginia, the cancer mortality rate in Appalachia is 10% higher than the national rate and 11% higher than non-Appalachian Virginia. 16 Our Cancer Center provides strategic services to rural residents including those from Appalachia and throughout Virginia to address disparities in cancer mortality. This rural cancer program benefits from extensive local, regional, and state-wide partnerships with regional outreach staff to support community-based participation and bi-directional communication between rural residents, communities and the academic cancer center. A representative Community Advisory Committee advises on strategic partnerships with health systems, rural care providers, churches, and community organizations to deliver culturally adapted, evidence-based programming, intervention, and screening services.",

Certain environmental exposures, such as living in a rural or farming community, have been associated with an increased risk for the development of AML. 17 The Iowa Women's Study found that women who lived on a farm or in a rural area were twice as likely to develop AML as compared with women who lived in a city (relative risk 2.38). 18 Further analysis demonstrated that even women who did not identify as a farmer but who lived on farms or in rural communities still had an increased risk of the development of AML. 19 The effect of geographic residence on genetic characteristics of AML is poorly understood. In addition, the impact of geographic residence on molecular characteristics is not well studied. In a study evaluating a cohort of AML patients from Florida and Arizona, several lifestyle and environmental factors, such as rural or farm habitats, obesity, and smoking, were evaluated to determine their effect on cytogenetics and outcomes of AML. 17 Although only 5% (n = 14) of the cohort resided in a farm habitat, more than half of those patients had poor risk cytogenetics.",

A retrospective analysis of 2570 patients with de novo AML found that African American patients (10.5% of the study population) presented at a younger age and were more likely to have favorable risk cytogenetics. Despite these good prognostic factors, African American men had lower complete remission (CR) rates as compared with African American women or white patients. 20 The authors of this study surmised the lower CR rates were due to biologic factors as there were no differences in other prognostic markers, induction regimens, or treatment-related toxicities. 20 Additionally, poverty has been associated with worse outcomes.",

Further studies will include these factors in addition to race to more completely assess the influence of social determinants of health. 30, 31 Traveling a distance to receive care has been associated with worse outcomes.

Outreach and engagement activities that will have short-or long-term impact are informed by the catchment area through formal and informal interactions with regional community groups. There is extensive collaboration including community action teams to focus on cancer screening, tobacco reduction, and healthy behaviors.

The initial hypothesis was that rural patients would have worse cytogenetics, mutations, and OS; however, there were no differences observed between patients from an urban or rural area. In addition, patients from urban and rural areas, despite differences in poverty level and education, had similar rates of receiving induction chemotherapy and proceeding with HCT. The similar OS rates may be attributed to many factors including intense telehealth, frequent communication with referring physicians, and patient treatment preferences. This highlights the importance of continuing to strengthen collaborative efforts between academic oncologists and local oncologists. Future studies incorporating the collection of geographic and socioeconomic data in a prospective study are planned to provide additional insight into treatment patterns and survival outcomes for patients from rural areas.",

More wellresourced patients may have chosen to travel to the academic center, thus introducing bias.While there continues to be progress in the care of cancer patients from rural areas including rural Appalachia, there are potential concerns on the horizon. One large change in health care over the past decade has been a transition from small intimate community care hospitals to large network health systems that may require high patient volumes to maintain their margin. Potential concerns with this transition include further limitations to access high quality specialty care required by patients with cancer who live in these rural communities.",
