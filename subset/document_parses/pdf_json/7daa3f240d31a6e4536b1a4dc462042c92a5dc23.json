Herein, we conducted a computational study to investigate the binding mechanism of four potential inhibitors (including disulfide derivatives isolated from Ferula foetida) to SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Our findings revealed that the disulfides mainly interacted with HIS41, MET49, CYS145, HIS64, MET165, and GLN189 residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease. The binding free energy decomposition results also showed that the van der Waals (vdW) energy plays the main role in the interaction of HIS41, MET49, CYS145, HIS64, MET165, and GLN189 residues with the inhibitors. Furthermore, it is found that the Z-isomer derivatives have a stronger interaction with SARS-CoV-2, and the strongest interaction belongs to the (Z)-1-(1-(methylthio)propyl)-2-(prop-1-enyl)disulfane (\u0394G = \u2212 18.672 kcal/mol). The quantum mechanical calculations demonstrated that the second-order perturbation stabilization energy and the electron density values for MET49-ligand interactions are higher than the other residue-ligand complexes. This finding confirms the stronger interaction of this residue with the ligands.",

The protein was prepared by adding the hydrogen atoms to its structure using Chimera software [27] . Then by the steepest descent algorithm [28] , energy minimization was performed, which terminated after 1000 steps. The SARS-CoV-2 main protease binding site was determined from the previous studies to ensure the ligands exactly bind to the receptor active site [13, 14] . Accordingly, the binding region is specified by defining a grid box with 22.0 \u00d7 23.0 \u00d7 22.0 A \u0366 3 dimension, which its center was in the coordinates of x = \u2212 11.14 A \u0366 , y = 19.90 A \u0366 , and z = 63.06 A \u0366 . Four different systems are designed in which each of the inhibitors is located at the center of the grid box. The dock screening was executed using the AutoDock [29] executable plugin in chimera software. The docking tool was generated ten poses per ligand in which the ligands attached to the protein binding site. The best-docked pose for each drug candidate was extracted for further analyses.",

The interacting residues of M pro involved in the binding of the ligands to the protein active site can be observed in Fig. 4 . As can be seen in this Figure panel A, E2S molecules interact with HIS41 and MET165. In the Z2S case, the ligand-receptor interaction becomes stronger in which four intermolecular interactions between the Z2S molecule and HIS41, MET49, CYS145, and MET65 are formed (Fig. 4B ). In two other systems, E3S and Z3S molecules form more intermolecular interactions with the binding site (E3S interact with HIS41, MET49, CYS145, HIS163, and MET165 sites and Z3S interact with HIS41, MET49, CYS145, and MET65). In these interactions, amino acids that have a sulfur group or an imidazole ring are involved in the formation of interactions with the ligands. According to the obtained results, it can be concluded that the hydrophobic interactions have the main role in the binding of the studied ligands to the active site of SARS-CoV-2 main protease.",

This observation can be related to the lowest number of the formed interaction of E2S with SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Furthermore, the comparison of docking and MD outcomes indicated that during MD simulation, the change in interacting residues with E2S and Z3S is more significant than two other inhibitors.

By using molecular docking, the high-scored configurations for all drugs are identified. The MD simulation results indicated the receptor-ligand complexes are almost stable. The HIS41, MET49, CYS145, HIS64, MET165, and GLN189 residues of SARS-CoV-2 main protease have the most interactions with the studied inhibitors. Furthermore, it is found the interaction of Z3S with SARS-CoV-2 main protease is relatively stronger than the other inhibitors. This inhibitor formed a stable complex with SARS-CoV-2 main protease through the vdW interactions. MET49, due to higher values of E (2) and the electron density, has a stronger interaction with the inhibitors.",
