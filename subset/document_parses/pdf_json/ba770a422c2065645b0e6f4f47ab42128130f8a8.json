[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] However, ICI therapy has also been associated with several immune-related adverse events (irAEs). 9 Cardiac irAEs with ICI therapy are not common but have a mortality rate of up to 30%, 9 and the occurrence of cardiac events with ICI therapy is likely under-reported. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Myocarditis is the most well-described cardiac irAE with ICI therapy [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] ; however, cardiac irAEs such as pericarditis, pericardial effusions, and acute vascular events are increasingly described. 11 12 15 20-22 The risk factors for the development of adverse cardiac events with ICI therapy are poorly understood. 14 Beyond combination immune therapy, 15 there are no established risk factors for cardiac events with ICI therapy. Identification of patients at increased risk of ICI-related cardiac side effects may support testing of rational surveillance strategies in such high-risk populations. However, efforts to identify a high-risk population have been limited by the sample size of most of the studies to date and identification of the optimal approach for such risk stratification. Machine learning (ML) has improved our ability to predict outcomes in oncology. 23 Furthermore, ML techniques better account for the complex interaction between risk factors which have gone relatively unevaluated so far. Using Shapley additive explanations (SHAP), ML can be used to discover novel insights into the disease process. [24] [25] [26] [27] Therefore, we created an ML decision tree model for predicting cardiac events among patients being treated with a PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitor in the Cancer-LinQ database. We also used SHAP to identify novel risk factors for future cardiac events. 28 ",

To ensure that all our events represented new cardiac disease, we did not include an event if the patient had a history of similar events prior to the index date. For example, if a patient had a history of heart failure prior to starting immunotherapy, heart failure ICD codes were ignored when defining cardiac events for this patient.

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is thought to be a marker of the inflammatory tumor microenvironment and therefore could represent a patient's potential risk of ICI-mediated cardiac toxicity. Traditionally, a low NLR has been associated with both a higher risk of toxicity and a higher response rate. 40 We found that patients with a low NLR were at decreased risk of cardiac events. This suggests that in patients with a low NLR, ICI therapies' ability to treat the tumor and reduce cardiopulmonary burden is protective against cardiac events. Platelets are known to express PD-1 receptors and interact with immunotherapy 41 and have traditionally been associated with a better response and higher rates of toxicity. 40 This is consistent with our findings.",

Baseline vital signs help identify baseline disease in the patient, even if the patient does not carry a formal diagnosis with an ICD code for that condition. For example, our final model identified patients with a heart rate of <60 or >100 beats/min as being at high risk of a future cardiac event. Having a heart rate outside of the normal range could suggest subclinical arrhythmias with an abnormal rate (<60 and >100 beats/min) or more severe heart failure (>100 beats/min). It is interesting that blood pressure was not a significant risk factor, while heart rate was. Although blood pressure can be abnormal in heart failure, we believe that heart rate is a more indicative finding. This is supported by the Boston criteria, which use tachycardia to diagnose heart failure but do not use blood pressure. 43 Our results also identified low temperature as a risk for cardiac events. A low body temperature has previously been associated with a low cardiac output and poor prognosis in patients with heart failure. 44 We identified several parallel and aligned factors related to heart failure and severity of heart failure that were associated with cardiac events after PD-1/PD-L1 therapy. Specifically, an elevated heart rate, lower hemoglobin, lower sodium, and lower chloride are all variables associated with the severity of heart failure and were also associated with cardiac events in our study. We found that a high BUN and low creatinine also increased cardiac risk. The BUN to creatinine ratio has long been associated with heart failure severity. ACE inhibitors and loop diuretics were associated with a decreased rate of cardiac events. The novel finding of an association between features of heart failure and future events after PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitory therapies is logical as a high incidence of the events post-PD-1 and PD-L1 therapies is related to heart failure. PD-1 and PD-L1 therapies may associate with heart failure through a variety of mechanisms. The most common mechanism is through the development of an acute and fulminant myocarditis. 14 The second, and less common and less well-understood mechanism, is via a progressive decline in the left ventricular ejection fraction without a clear acute fulminant process. Independent of the mechanism, the likelihood is that an impaired baseline cardiac reserve increases the probability that cardiac injury with an ICI will become clinically manifest as a heart failure event. What is unclear, and needs to be the focus of future studies, is whether the baseline elevated risk with heart failure is related to heart failure with a reduced ejection fraction, heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction, or both, and how baseline cardiac medications such as inhibitors of the angiotensin system or beta-blockers for heart failure may attenuate this risk.",

To define cardiac events, we used both curated adverse events that were documented by a team of nurse abstractors and ICD codes documented in the patient chart. The frequency of different cardiac events is described in table 1. In our study, 8% of patients had a cardiac event. In general, we found a high incidence of atrial fibrillation, heart failure, and pericardial disease in our cohort. While the rate of myocarditis in ICI patients is thought to be less than 1%, 57 the rate of other cardiac events secondary to ICItherapy is still unknown. A recent meta-analysis found that 0.5% of patients with cancer treated with ICIs developed myocarditis, 0.3% developed heart failure, and 4.6% developed atrial fibrillation. In addition, pericardial effusion occurred in 0.5% of patients, cardiomyopathy in 0.3% of patients, myocardial infarction in 0.4% of patients, and cardiac arrest in 0.4% of patients. 58 Our findings are in line with other studies using EHR data. For example, Waheed et al reported 15% of ICI patient developed new cardiac disease: 0.4% developed cardiomyopathy; 5% developed heart failure; 6% developed an arrhythmia; 2% developed pericardiac disease; 2% developed heart block; and 0.2% developed myocarditis. 59 It is possible that pre-existing atrial fibrillation/heart failure is being routinely documented by a patient's oncologist, even if the patient is not experiencing new disease. To address this concern, we did not count ICD/MedDRA codes as cardiac events if similar codes were already part of the patient's medical history. However, whether these cardiac events truly represent new heart failure, an exacerbation of existing heart failure, or routine documentation of existing disease is impossible to tell with real-world data and is a major limitation of our study.",

In our case, neither of these mechanisms are possible. Because XGBoost treats missing values as a separate entity, no patients are excluded in the modeling process and no values need be imputed. Missing values are simply treated as another value in SHAP plots and can be interpreted separately from the non-missing values. Indeed, XGBoost has been previously sited for its ability to robustly manage missing data in large EMR datasets. 60 In light of these findings, we did not remove features with high missingness rates from our final model.
