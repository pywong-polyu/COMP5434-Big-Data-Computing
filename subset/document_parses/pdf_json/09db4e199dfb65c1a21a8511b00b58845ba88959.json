            "text": "Real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) neurofeedback allows individuals to self-modulate their ongoing brain activity. This may be a useful tool in clinical disorders which are associated with altered brain activity patterns. Motor impairment after stroke has previously been associated with decreased laterality of motor cortex activity. Here we examined whether chronic stroke survivors were able to use real-time fMRI neurofeedback to increase laterality of motor cortex activity and assessed effects on motor performance and on brain structure and function. We carried out a randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled trial in which 24 chronic stroke survivors with mild to moderate upper limb impairment experienced three training days of either Real (n=12) or Sham (n=12) neurofeedback. Stroke survivors were able to use Real neurofeedback to increase laterality of motor cortex activity within, but not across, training days. Improvement in gross hand motor performance assessed by the Jebsen Taylor Test (JTT) was observed in the Real neurofeedback group compared to Sham. However, there were no improvements on the Action Research Arm Test (ARAT) or the Upper Extremity Fugl-Meyer (UE-FM) score. Additionally, decreased white-matter asymmetry of the corticospinal tracts was detected 1-week after neurofeedback training, indicating that the tracts become more similar with Real neurofeedback. Changes in the affected corticospinal tract was positively correlated with neurofeedback performance. Therefore, here we demonstrate that chronic stroke survivors are able to use fMRI neurofeedback to self-modulate motor cortex activity, and that training is associated with improvements in hand motor performance and with white matter structural changes.",

Rehabilitation typically focuses on the stroke affected limb, however, there has been increased interest in interventions that target the brain (e.g. brain stimulation), in the hope of boosting rehabilitation effects and further improving motor function. These studies typically target motor cortex activity and many attempt to promote lateralization of activity towards the stroke-affected motor cortex (for review : 3, 4) .",

            "text": "A novel alternative approach, which harnesses the brains intrinsic capacity for activity modulation, is for stroke survivors to learn to self-modulate brain activity through real-time fMRI neurofeedback (NF). Previous work has shown some promising behavioral effects of fMRI NF (e.g. [5] [6] [7] , and fMRI NF has been explored in various clinical conditions associated with aberrant brain activity patterns, for example depression (8, 9) , pain disorders (10, 11) and phobias (12, 13) . FMRI NF has also been suggested as a potentially useful tool in stroke rehabilitation (14, 15) , however to date no randomized, sham-controlled trials have been published. Previous pilot studies have shown that stroke survivors appear to be able to use fMRI NF to control activity in a variety of motor regions (16) (17) (18) demonstrating feasibility of this approach. After sufficient training, participants receiving NF training may be able to maintain the ability to self-modulate brain activity outside of the training sessions, leading to potentially long-lasting improvements (for review see: (19) ).",

The JTT and EEG measures were also carried out at the end of each NF training day. During NF training, participants observed two moving vertical bars whose heights represented ongoing activity in the stroke affected (red bar) and unaffected (blue bar) primary motor cortices ( Figure 1B ). Participants were instructed to move their stroke-affected hand and try to increase the height of the red bar, while keeping the blue bar low. This corresponded to increasing laterality of brain activity in the primary motor cortices (M1) towards the stroke-affected hemisphere. During each training day, participants completed three runs of NF (or Sham) training (see Materials and Methods: Neurofeedback Intervention). On each day, before and after NF training, NF learning transfer was assessed by asking participants to move their strokeaffected hand while attempting to regulate their brain activity in the absence of NF. A debriefing questionnaire was completed after every training day, which showed that both groups experienced similar control over the bars (Supplementary figure S2) interest (ROIs) used for NF training were defined during a functional localizer. ROIs (red and blue squares) were centered on peak activity in M1 during movements of both hands. Right: During NF training, only the strokeaffected hand was moved and participants viewed two bars on the screen. The red bar represented activity in the stroke affected hemisphere and the blue bar represented activity in the unaffected hemisphere. During movement blocks, participants were instructed to make movements with their stroke affected hand to increase the size of the red bar, while keeping the blue bar as low as possible.",

However, consistent with prior literature (27, 28) , NF training success was highly variable across participants in the Real NF group. Importantly, this variability in NF success during training was linked to the persistence of NF gains. Participants who were more successful at self-modulating brain activity during NF, were also more likely to be able to increase motor activity laterality in the absence of NF. However, there was no evidence of this association on a constrained visuomotor squeeze task, suggesting that this association only applies to certain movements. Research has begun to investigate factors related to variability in NF learning success (e.g. [28] [29] [30] , which could allow future studies with larger samples to identify individuals most likely to respond to NF training using baseline measures.",

This lack of an effect on clinical measures may be due to a number of factors. One possibility is that laterality of brain activity may not be a suitable intervention target for all stroke survivors. In particular, it has previously been suggested that more severely affected stroke survivors may instead benefit from boosting activity in both M1's (34) . Additionally, neuromodulation approaches are often considered not as treatments per se, but rather as approaches that enhance the potential for use-dependent plasticity (35) . Therefore, the addition of further motor rehabilitation outside of the scanner, to drive the motor system while it is 'primed', may be necessary to elicit observable effects of NF training on clinical measures. For example, a previous study in Parkinson's patients found clinically relevant improvements of symptoms after just two sessions of NF combined with extensive practice outside of the scanner using the successful strategies identified during training (36) . However, the finding of an effect on the gross sub-tasks of the JTT is a promising first indication that NF can induce behavioral change in this population, and ways to bolster this effect should be explored further. Especially considering that the current study NF training was conducted on a relatively short timescale (3 sessions of 20mins) and without further practice outside the scanner.",

Furthermore, the addition of motor rehabilitation and more training sessions could establish whether clinically relevant changes in behavior can be achieved with fMRI NF. Using fMRI has the advantage of whole brain coverage, allowing to monitor changes throughout the brain which may shed light on mechanisms involved and off-target changes that may underlie changes in behavior. However, cheaper and more practical modalities such as EEG would lend themselves to the clinical translation of this approach. FMRI NF is a highly flexible approach and it has become increasingly transparent that it is unlikely that there is a one-size-fits-all rehabilitation solution for all stroke survivors, and the need to stratify individuals has been highlighted (56, 57) .

Participants were given some suggested strategies that they could try, including opening and closing their stroke-affected hand or tapping individual fingers (see Supplementary methods: Suggested strategies), however it was made clear that they could use whatever strategies they wished. Each NF training run consisted of six 30-second NF blocks during which the instruction \"Move Left\" or \"Move Right\" (depending on which hand was stroke-affected), was displayed above the bars, and seven interspersed 30-second rest blocks, during which the instruction changed to \"Rest\". Participants were explicitly instructed not to move their stroke-unaffected hand at any point. After each NF training run the participants were allowed to rest until they felt ready to continue onto the next run. Participants in the Sham group received identical instructions and tasks as participants in the Real group, however instead of seeing their own brain activity displayed in the NF bars, they saw a video of a previous participant's feedback.",

The threshold of activity that voxels needed to achieve for inclusion in the LI calculation was then set to 50% of this mean maximum activity. This ensured that only activity from the most active voxels was included in the LI calculation and that the average activity for each ROI was above 0.

Random intercepts per participant were included in the random effects structures and the addition of random slopes per participant in the random effects structure was assessed using a likelihood ratio test (67) . There were no cases where the addition of random slopes significantly improved the model fit. P-values for fixed effects were derived using the Satterthwaite approximation for degrees of freedom, as implemented in the package lmerTest (68) . This approach has previously been shown to be less prone to type I errors, and is less sensitive to sample size than other methods (69) . Post-hoc comparisons were carried out using the emmeans package, with tukey method for multiple comparisons.

(A)Laterality of M1 activity (LI) is displayed for the Real (green/left, n=12) and Sham (grey/right, n=12) group over all the training runs and days. Bars represent group means, grey lines show individual participant data and error bars represent s.e.m. (B) Top: When considering NF learning within training days by averaging LI for each run (pooled over training days), a significant interaction could be observed between Run and Group (p=0.037), with the Real group increasing LI over runs, whilst the Sham group didn't change. Estimated marginal means and confidence shown for each run. Bottom: When assessing NF learning across training days by averaging LI for each day (pooled over runs), there were no significant interaction or main effects. (C) There was no group-level transfer effect; participants in both groups have similar change in LI on the transfer runs (data displayed as in A).(D) However, the relationship between transfer change and NF success differs between the groups (p=0.002), with a positive relationship found for the Real group, and a negative one for the Sham group. Shaded areas represent 95% confidence intervals. *p<0.05Behavioral and clinical measures (Primary outcome: Gross motor hand performance improves following Real NF trainingThe second primary outcome measure of this trial was motor performance changes on the JTT.Performance on the JTT was measured at baseline, after each NF (or sham) training session, 1week after training and 1-month later. A LMM was carried out on the average time (logtransformed) over all sub-tasks at each time point, with Group and Day as fixed factors, baseline time as a covariate and random intercepts in the random effects structure. This revealed a main effect of Time (F(4,90.326)=3.207, p=0.017), with participants in both groups improving over time (post-hoc linear contrast: t(99.3)=-2.818, p=0.006, b=-0.205, SE=0.073). However, there was no main effect of Group (F(1,24.225)=2.660, p=0.116) or Group\u00b4Time interaction (F(4,90.326)=1.388, p=0.2445) (Figure 3A). In line with previous research (22-24), we also separately analysed performance on Gross motor sub-tasks of the JTT (stacking checkers, moving heavy objects, moving light objects) and Fine motor sub-tasks of the JTT (card turning, picking up small objects, simulated feeding). A LMM was carried out with Group, Day and Task (Gross, Fine) as fixed effects, baseline performance as a covariate and random intercepts in the random effects structure. There was a significant main effect of Task (F(1,168)=33.374, p<0.001) and Group\u00b4Task interaction (F(1,183.32)=42.05, p<0.001). Post-hoc pairwise comparisons revealed that this effect was driven by faster performance in the Real group compared to the Sham group on the Gross motor tasks (t(34.8)=-2.711, p=0.01; Real-Sham: b=-0.247, SE=0.091) (Figure 3B). In contrast, there was not a significant difference between the two groups on performance of the Fine motor tasks (Figure 3C; t(34.8)=0.432, p=0.668; Real-Sham: b=0.039, SE=0.091). Whilst the main effect of Day approached significance (F(4,156.05)=2.412, p=0.051), there were no other significant main effects of interactions (all F<2, p>0.1). Overall, these findings suggest that participants in the Real group had improved performance on gross motor tasks compared to the Sham group. Secondary outcomes: No evidence for Real NF effects on the ARAT or UE-FM Secondary outcome measures included changes in participants' performance on two clinical measures, the ARAT and the UE-FM (Figure 3D&E). Performance on these measures was assessed at baseline, 1-week post intervention and 1-month later. When comparing the two groups at the 1-week follow-up, with baseline as a covariate, the two groups were not significantly different from each other on the ARAT (F(1,21)=0.717, p=0.407, ! \" =0.033), or the UE-FM (F(1,21)=0.057,p=0.813, ! \" =0.003). Similarly, at the 1-month follow-up there was also no difference between the groups on either measure (ARAT: F(1,15)=0.308, p=0.587, ! \" =0.020. UE-FM: F(1,15)=0.055, p=0.818, ! \" =0.004).

During the scan, participants saw an empty grey bar on the screen. Periodically, a yellow line, which represented their target force, would appear across the grey bar, and participants were instructed to squeeze on the force transducer until a blue bar (which represented the current force exerted on the force transducer) reached the yellow line, at which point they should release. The frequency with which the yellow line appeared (i.e. frequency of squeezing) was set to a comfortable rate for each participant, but was typically between 0.25 and 0.35hz. Four 30-second squeezing blocks were interspersed with four 30seconds rest blocks during which a fixation cross was presented on the screen.The visuomotor squeeze task for EEG was similar to that described for fMRI. In each session, four movements blocks were performed, with rest breaks between. Each block consisted of 10, 5second trials, with 5.5-6.5second inter-trial interval.
