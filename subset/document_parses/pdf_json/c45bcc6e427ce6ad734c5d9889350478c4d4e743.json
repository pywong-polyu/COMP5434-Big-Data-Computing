This paper introduces the concept of ecotrust within healthcare as means to capture a co-produced, relational response to the abundance of (mis)information produced by the current infodemic. As an approach that recognizes the contributions of and impact on all members of the system, ecotrust encourages research that explores the process by which trust emerges as a shared reality from both the provider's or healthcare team's perspectives, as well as the patient experience, potentially leading to new conversations and strategies for partnering together. Finally, ecotrust encourages the skills of relationship-centered communication as a specific strategy for entering conversations with curiosity and empathy, thus encouraging relationship-building as a humanistic first step for responding to (mis)information.",

We also believe that better understanding the healthcare team's sensemaking towards trusting patients has implications for a wide array of overlapping conversations including vaccine hesitancy, equity and inclusion, and adherence and self-management, with important implications for each. To that end, it is important to explore not just what allows patients to trust healthcare, but what allows patients and healthcare teams to generate trust together.",

Shifting trust research to a dynamic orientation impacts healthcare in particular by pivoting the traditional focus from the patients' ability to trust providers, specifically physicians, in the face of risk and vulnerability, to a relational approach that considers how trust is co-produced between and among people.",

Similar to the generative origins of Appreciative Inquiry, co-production also potentially opens space to \"spontaneous, unsupervised, individual, group and organizational action toward a better future.\" (13, 14) More specifically, generativity, particularly as it relates to trust, may result in \"new forms of care other than health care (e.g., inclusive relationships, solidarity), values beyond economic value (e.g., equity, justice), and new insights and research practices that are relevant to different disciplines and practices (e.g., community participation, patient advocacy, collaborative research)\" (12) .",

How do we redirect our instincts to match information with more information and instead first offer relationship as the foundation of trust? For this task we turn to relationshipcentered communication, an outgrowth of relationshipcentered care. As a concept relationship-centered care assumes a systems perspective by acknowledging the importance of all relationships within healthcare beyond the patient-provider. Relationship-centered care was first outlined by the Pew-Fetzer Task Force in 1994 and continued to evolve as both a theoretical and applied concept noted by Suchman as \"the capacity of individuals working in partnership to produce results that are greater than the sum of their individual efforts, the value of the collaborative process, and the importance of self-awareness and personal authenticity.\" (16, 17) Relationship-centered communication is the collection of specific skills that facilitate care, and arguably trust. These evidence-based skills include asking about the other's most important concerns, attention to the personal and emotional stories embedded within the exchange, and emphasis on asking the other's perspective, rather than assuming expert status (18) . While relationship-centered communication is an evolving and incomplete toolbox for ecotrust, with an emphasis on curiosity and connection, it provides an ideal framework for initiating generative conversations within the healthcare context. For instance, Dr. Kimberly Manning suggests shifting language from \"vaccine hesitation\" to \"vaccine deliberation\" when it comes to discussions about vaccinations, particularly COVID, in order to more fully recognize and explore the complexity involved with an individual's vaccination choice (19) . We can also argue the importance of utilizing relationship-centered communication to enhance trust with patients and families at the end of life, during consent for surgery and other moments in healthcare that produce heightened vulnerability. Furthermore, ecotrust produced through relationship-centered communication has application to many contexts beyond healthcare including, but not limited to community relationships with educators, law enforcement, and organized religion, which have also experienced significant scrutiny in recent years.",

We further suggest that ecotrust is best supported by a framework of co-production, which can account for the complex, dynamic, and evolving nature of trust in human relationships. A framework of co-production would attend both to the patient and family's trust of other healthcare team members, as well as the team's trust towards the patient, which traditionally exists as a research gap. More specifically, we propose that meaningfully entering into these co-produced conversations with the patient and among team members might best be accomplished through the skills and paradigm of relationship-centered communication, as it implicitly guides speakers to a more relational stance through curious questions and empathic response, moving trust beyond dueling billboards and infodemics to authentic relationships on which to build a better healthcare system.",
