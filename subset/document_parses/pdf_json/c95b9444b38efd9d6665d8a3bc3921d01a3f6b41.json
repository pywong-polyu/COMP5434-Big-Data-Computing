Additionally, web-based chatbots based on NLP can assess patient sentiments and improve quality care. 7 Additionally, the other two popular conversational agents, ELIZA and A.L.I.C.E (Artificial Linguistic Internet Computer Entity), are known as the first human interaction chatbots. ELIZA operates using computational linguistics with simply parsing and keyword substitution into reframed phrases. 8 Therefore, it can understand user experiences and feelings. This conversational agent initiates the user chat with simple sentence structure and punctuation, and the user statement is ended with a twofold carriage response. However, A.L.I.C.E can convert readable texts (i.e. corpus) into Artificial Intelligence Markup Language (AIML) to disclose the possibility of useful prototypes without complex ML algorithms. 9 It also incorporates NLP techniques that help engage in human conversation by applying heuristically matched rules to the user input. It was inspired by the old ELIZA program.",

Stemming is a sub-stream of NLP techniques, which reduces a word to its stem with a text result, less readable by humans. It is an algorithm that converts the word into a root word. 11 In addition to GD, text classification algorithms are included to evaluate better outcome response. Initially, the user inputs are applied to the NLP framework to generate an output response. The input undergoes different steps such as tokenisation, stemming, and enumeration and converted to a bag of words. In tokenisation, simple tokens are broken into simple words. Next, the tokens are transferred as root words; this is called stemming. The bag of words model pre-processes the given text by converting its simple words and keeps a count of total occurrences of high-frequency words. Finally, the bag of words produces the input for the ANN model and evaluates individual probabilities of each response to generate the highest probability words as outcomes fetched from the JavaScript object notation (JSON) file.",

FNN is an artificial neural network in which information moves in only one direction, forward from the input nodes, via the hidden nodes, and to the output nodes. The goal of this network is to assign a class to each word from a bag of words (one of the tags from the JSON file). The trained data are split into small word batches, and the GD algorithm is applied to every batch sequentially to find the appropriate response. It makes the algorithm function faster and efficiently. Only a single batch of words can be passed through the neural networks at a time to compute the loss of every sample batch. Their average is used to update the neural network parameters. The minibatch descent algorithm finds the best of two words and updates each mini-batch of n n training samples. In a given command, the trained set has 1000 training examples. It is divided into eight batches, with each batch comprising 125 training examples. Model training is conducted using the number of epochs, set according to the number of times that the model will encounter the same information while training. The training command of the model is:",
