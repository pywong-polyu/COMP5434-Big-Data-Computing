However, recently, the virus has been widely spread in most of the world countries and is reported as a pandemic. Further, nowadays, all the world countries are striving to control the coronavirus disease COVID-19. There are many mechanisms to detect the coronavirus disease COVID-19 including clinical analysis of chest CT scan images and blood test results. The confirmed COVID-19 patient manifests as fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Particularly, several techniques can be used to detect the initial results of the virus such as medical detection Kits. However, such devices are incurring huge cost and it takes time to install them and use. Therefore, in this paper, a new framework is proposed to detect coronavirus disease COVID-19 using onboard smartphone sensors. The proposal provides a low-cost solution, since most of the radiologists have already held smartphones for different daily-purposes. People can use the framework on their smartphones for the virus detection purpose. Today's smartphones are powerful with existing computationrich processors, memory space, and large number of sensors including cameras, microphone, temperature sensor, inertial sensors, proximity, colour-sensor, humidity-sensor, and wireless chipsets/sensors. The designed Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled framework reads the smartphone sensors' signal measurements to predict the grade of severity of the pneumonia as well as predicting the result of the disease.",

Moreover, MERS virus cases was first announced in Saudi Arabia and caused the death of 858 out of 2494 person. Based on the analysis of virus genomes, this virus was originated in bats [6] . The clinical presentation of the COVID-19 is complicated and could be manifested as fever, cough and severe headache. There are several techniques for COVID-19 detection, such as A Nucleic Acid Test (NAT) and Computed Tomography (CT) scan. The NAT is utilized to detect specific nucleic acid sequence and species of organism, predominately a virus or bacteria that can cause disease in blood, tissue or urine. Despite NAT technique and detection kits becoming significant for COVID-19 virus detection, CT scan is most effective and functional for detecting the severity and degree of the lung inflammation [7] . The National Health Commission of China confirmed the inclusion of radiographic presentation of pneumonia for clinical diagnostic standard in Hubei Province [8] . This assures the significant of the CT scan images for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia severity.",

Particularly, at the province of Hubei, suspected cases, confirmed COVID-19 patients and cases under medical observation need to go through CT imaging of lung. Even the opacity of infected lung are small in the early stage of a patient suspected of contracting COVID-19. Besides, the number of radiologists compares much less than the increased number of patients. As a result, this makes medical systems and physicians overloaded.

The well-known symptoms of the disease are: fever, fatigue, headache, nausea, dry-cough, lung CT imaging features, and shortness of breath. Each of these symptoms has its own level which could be differentiate from other disease including flue-symptoms, cold-symptoms and hay fever symptoms. For this reason, the framework is trying to discover the level of each symptoms based on the onboard sensors measurements. In addition, a set of sensors technologies are embedded on the smartphones including cameras, inertial sensors, microphone, and temperature sensor. In addition, the readings of these sensors technologies have been used for those symptoms which are exist in the coronavirus diseases. As state of the art, algorithms are separately applied on each of these sensors' readings to detect the level of the symptoms for the human-health purposes. For example, temperature-fingerprint sensor as it is located under the smartphone's touch-screen has been used to predict the fever level in [12] . Camera captured images and videos are used to detect human fatigue in different environment via human-gait analysis in [13] . Further, onboard inertial sensors (such as accelerometer sensors) have been used in [12] and [14] to detect the fatigue level, as well. In [15] , the nausea prediction has been analysis based on smartphones-enabled video observation and directly observed treatments. In another vain, both camera sensor and inertial sensors' measurements have been utilized in [16] to monitor neck posture and consequently to predict the level of humanheadache. A comprehensive work has been studied to indicate the type of cough via using smartphone-microphone chipset in [17] and [18] .",

This is followed by getting the predicted level results of symptoms from the applied algorithms and stored them in a dataset as a single record. Thus, such records from different patients could be collected and used as input to a machine learning techniques. There are several machine learning techniques for the human-health purposes such as: decision tree, support vector machine, knearest neighbors, and neural networks. The most recent and accurate machine learning technique is deep learning techniques, as they are referred to neural network family. Many deep learning algorithms have been utilized for the classification or recognition purposes such as convolution neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) algorithms. CNN is feed-forward neural network which is generally used for spatial data such as image recognition [19] . While with RNN, the output of each layer will be saved and then it will be used as an input for the next layers as well as the RNN is good for temporal data such text [20] and signal measurements [21] .",

For example, reading the captured CT scan images of lung and captured videos through using smartphone camera, getting the inertial sensors (accelerometer sensor) measurements during 30-second sit-tostand, recording microphone voice measurements during a series of cough, and finally scanning temperature sensor measurements during fingerprint touching on the smartphone screen. The second layer is structured to configure the onboard smartphone sensors including reading intervals, image size, buffers' size, timer resolution, and etc. Further, the readings and configurations are then used as the input of the symptoms algorithms which are running on the smartphone application. The third layer of the framework provides a the calculated symptoms level, separately, and then stored as a record input to the next layer. The last layer is to applying the machine learning techniques to predict the coronavirus disease COVID-19. The machine learning techniques could be used according to the nature of the recorded data. For example, for the abnormal sub-image of the CT scan images, the CNN could be used. This is followed by using RNN for the rest of the recorded data. Therefore, a new combined CNN and RNN machine learning technique can be proposed for the Fig. 2 . CT images of the patient: opacities can be seen in the right lung of images A and B. 2 days later, an increase of opacities can be observed in images C and D. In sixth day, lesions can be observed. In images F, G, H, in ninth day, progressive lesions is shown in left and right lungs. Image F shows the appearance of small bilateral pleural effusions. [22] . framework.",

Certainly, CT scan images is a key method to detect COVID-19. An algorithm can be developed to diagnose the lesions of a patient caused by COVID-19 and analysing its size and density. The algorithm can compare multiple CT images of the lung lesions. The most important output of the algorithm is the volume and density of lesions. The most compelling evidence of the confirmed COVID-19 case is an increase of density and volume of lesions in CT images. Certainly, comparing multiple CT images takes long time and its interpretation, by the radiologists, cannot accurately be concluded manually. Thus, the proposed framework assists radiologists and enables people to make efficient and confident decision on the suspected cases.",
