            "text": "Social influence pervades our everyday lives and lays the foundation for complex social phenomena, such as the spread of misinformation and the polarization of communities. In a crisis like the COVID-19 pandemic, social influence can determine whether lifesaving information is adopted, public health measures are observed, or immunization campaigns meet their targets. Existing literature studying online social influence suffers from several drawbacks. First, a disconnect appears between psychology approaches, which are generally performed and tested in controlled lab experiments, and the quantitative methods, which are usually data-driven and rely on network and event analysis. The former are slow, expensive to deploy, and typically do not generalize well to topical issues (such as an ongoing pandemic); the latter often oversimplify the complexities of social influence and ignore psychosocial literature. This work bridges this gap and presents three contributions towards modeling and empirically quantifying online influence. The first contribution is a data-driven Generalized Influence Model that incorporates two novel psychosocial-inspired mechanisms: the conductance of the diffusion network and the social capital distribution. The second contribution is a framework to empirically rank users' social influence using a human-in-the-loop active learning method combined with crowdsourced pairwise influence comparisons. We build a human-labeled ground truth, calibrate our generalized influence model and perform a large-scale evaluation of influence. We find that our generalized model outperforms the current state-ofthe-art approaches and corrects the inherent biases introduced by the widely used follower count. As the third contribution, we apply the influence model to discussions around COVID-19. We quantify users' influence, and we tabulate it against their professions. We find that the executives, media, and military are more influential than pandemic-related experts such as life scientists and healthcare professionals. These findings call on such professionals to own up to their responsibility for shaping social reactions.",

Still, they are slow, expensive to deploy, and cannot be leveraged in real-time (say to analyze influence in pandemicrelated discussions). The quantitative approaches [14, 18, 56] scale to large networks and model the emergent behavior therein. However, these are usually data-driven tools that make \"empirically questionable simplifying assumptions\" [43] .

The first question concerns quantitatively modeling and estimating influence from online conversations data. The conductance ( [16, 49] , see Section 3.1.1) and social attribution ( [16, 32, 45] , see Section 3.1.2) are known in psychosocial literature to modulate the exertion of social influence. However, these factors are not considered by quantitative models. For conductance, these models often assume that social ties are the primary influence channels, while other conductive channels (like recommender systems and homophily) are underexplored. For social attribution, the question is who gets the (social) credit in a chain of influence exertion. Consider the example in Fig. 1 . Alice influences Bobbie, who influences several people; should Alice (the initiator) or Bobbie (the connector) be attributed more social capital? Therefore, we ask how do we model influence to account for network conductance and social attribution mechanisms?",

Psychological studies mainly concentrate on identifying the characteristics that allow individuals to exert influence -such as authority, likeability, attractiveness, and expertise [16] . However, such works deal less with measuring relative influence between individuals and the emergence of social capital (defined as the confluence of said influence-enabling characteristics). Furthermore, performing pairwise comparisons between individuals scales quadratically with the size of the cohort, quickly rendering the costs prohibitive and keeping the size of the studies small. Additionally, without laboratory-controlled environments, data fidelity can suffer. Therefore, how do we generate an empirical social capital ranking, true to the complexities of social influence, and scale it feasibly to large cohorts?",

The question is how to select which pairs to compare to maximize the ranking quality with the minimum number of comparisons. Passive techniques choose pairs before running the experiment; however, they do not use the information learned during the experiment. Here, we employ a solution that exploits active learning to choose comparisons on the fly. Past comparisons inform future choices, which in turn are more informative than random choices. Sparse pairwise comparisons matrix via human-in-the-loop active learning. Our empirical influence quantification method builds on the active learning approach introduced by Maystre and Grossglauser [44] . We use the standard Quicksort algorithm to select pairs in the sparse pairwise comparison matrix . We implement a human-in-the-loop system, in which human judges make the pairwise comparisons (using the MTurk platform), while the algorithm chooses which pairs to compare and builds the final ranking. Furthermore, we implement Quicksort recursively; at each iteration, the sorting of the left (<) and right (\u2265) subpartitions are performed in parallel; fully taking advantage of MTurk's massive worker pool. In its design (see Section 2.2), Quicksort exploits information from past comparisons to reduce the number of future comparisons required to complete the task; therefore minimizing the total experiment cost.",

First, GIM consistently Paretodominates (i.e., outperforms) all baselines for almost every hyperparameter combinations, showing that our psychosocial-inspired mechanisms render automatic influence quantification closer to the human judgment. Among baselines, the best performing is the Hawkes-modeled influence, followed by PageRank, retweet influence, and the purpose-built ProfileRank. Second, we observe that the homophilic conductance typically outperforms the topological conductance and that the lexical outperforms the following conductance. Third, only two models are not Pareto-dominated: the topological-none (best NDCG-AUC) and the lexical-social capital (best neg. MAPE). Notice, however, that the topological conductance requires recovering the follower network. In practice, this is prohibitive for large datasets (such as the #Covid-19 dataset) due to rate limitations of the Twitter API. Therefore, in our analysis in Section 4.4 we use the homophilic lexical conductance ( = 0.18) with the social capital distribution ( = 0.02). The 18% baseline conductance indicates that the accounted channels do not explain a relatively large proportion of conductance. Note that while passing 2% of the social capital to the parent might not seem much, this adds up for nodes with high degrees (particularly given the longtail distribution of follower count).",

The latter is an occupation with high bipartisan support and respect in the US -home of most Englishspeaking Twitter users. Notably, Media and Entertainers are not only influential but have the most prominent online presences, perhaps on account of their attention-related business models. At the opposite end of the spectrum (and somewhat suprisingly) are Architects, Engineers and Computer Specialists with the lowest influence. Engineers, although prominent online, are not very influential and Computer Specialists have less influence than the general public.",

Next, we analyze the influence of three occupations heavily involved in communicating during the COVID-19 pandemic: Healthcare (including diagnosing and treating practitioners), Media and Communication, and Life Scientists. In Fig. 3c , we compare pairs of these occupations tabulated against the follower count-influence's most important covariate. We split the users into five equally-sized bins according to their follower count percentiles, and we plot influence distribution in each bin. We make three observations. First, the Media is more influential about the pandemic than the pandemic experts (Healthcare and Life Scientists), particularly in the highly-follower bins. While this is expected given the media's role to inform the public, it could be problematic if the media outlets are more fringe and biased [20] ) or cover misinformation and conspiracy theories. Second, the distributions in each bin show a mode around low influence scores. This reinforces prior findings that followership does not translate into large influence [7, 57] . Finally, Healthcare is more influential than Life Scientists, despite the latter including epidemiologists, medical scientists, and microbiologists; users are relying more on the advice of medical doctors and frontline workers than on research experts.",

Recent computational approaches [40, 41, 54] predict micro-level behavior but do not offer measures, and multivariate Hawkes approaches do not easily scale [50] . Furthermore, crowdsourcing is commonly used to recover psychosocial attributes [8, 15, 33] . Several recommender approaches utilize social concepts like homophily [27, 28, 63, 66] , and diffusions [28, 48] . Arous et al. [4] use crowdsourcing to find influencers, aggregating open-ended answers, but don't provide an influence model capable of querying arbitrary users.

The implementation runs quicksort partitions concurrently, such that comparison pairs enter a FIFO queue and are served to MTurk workers in batches of 10. Each global quicksort procedure over the entire sample called a run, is executed sequentially such that no identical pairs are shown in the same batch since quicksort compares items at most once. The workers were presented with two target users and a proxy user (see below). Workers were asked, via a pool of differently worded questions, to determine which target user was more influential to the proxy. These questions are \"Which user is the proxy user most likely to retweet?\", \"Who will the proxy user be more socially influenced by?\", and \"Which user would sway the proxy users opinion more?\". We performed three runs for each ablation and removed the banning of workers between ablations.",

Fig. 2a shows the removal of these metrics significantly reduces the accuracy. When all metrics are removed, we observe the worst decision accuracy 0.57. In particular, when only the followee or status metrics are present, we observe an increased accuracy of 0.61 and 0.68, respectively; when both are present (without follower count), we observe another accuracy increase to 0.70. Note that when all metrics are included, the accuracy increases to 0.72, which cumulatively suggests that all metrics are independently important signals of influence; however, there is some mutual information between the metrics.",

The responses of some workers might be consistently inaccurate for several reasons; they are answering randomly for monetary gain, they do not understand the task or social context, or they respond in bad faith for some other reason. We broadly label such workers as low-quality workers. If low-quality workers complete large proportions of work, reducing overall quality, and accordingly, we ban them dynamically.",

Firstly, only comparisons where the difference of follower count percentiles is greater than 0.2 are included in determining accuracy. The intuition is that targets with quasi-equivalent influence are difficult to judge. Secondly, banning is only implemented after having completed 100 comparisons that satisfy the prior condition. Lastly, the banning decision is only made once per run (but a banned worker is banned forever). This banning scheme is lenient enough that work is completed quickly, while restrictive enough that response quality remains high. Removing the intra-banning mechanism performs slightly better than the baseline, with an accuracy of 0.73, which might be explained by 'low-quality workers' being discouraged from that task by previous interactions with the experiment.

To determine if a user was English-speaking (so the majoritively English-speaking MTurk workers could appropriately judge them), triple-agreement was used between three language detection systems langid [42] , cld3 [25] , and whatthelang. We verified the (55.8% remaining) filtered users were uniform with respect to Hawkes-modeled influence, via a chi-square test at a 95% significance level.
