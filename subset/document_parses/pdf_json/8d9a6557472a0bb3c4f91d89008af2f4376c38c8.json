The global pandemic has negatively impacted pregnant women's access to prenatal care. The current study sought to understand the health-seeking behaviour of women who were pregnant during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in Kenya. Methods: The \"Three Delay\" model theoretical framework was applied to piece together the pregnant women's health-seeking behaviour during the early stages of the pandemic through focus group discussions. The collected qualitative data was analysed using thematic analysis. Results: The delays in deciding to seek care, delays in reaching healthcare facilities and delays in receiving quality healthcare services at the healthcare facility were a result of the fear of contracting the virus. These delays were occasioned by participants' personal experiences and uncertainties about COVID-19 pandemic, compulsory quarantines, national cessation of movements, compulsory lockdowns, loss of income to many households and the influence of traditional birth attendants (TBAs). Conclusion: The current study found that fear of COVID-19 was a major factor that hindered access to maternal healthcare services. In this regard, there is a need to upscale awareness creation on the significance of seeking maternal health services during the pandemic to reduce the possibility of obliterating the gains made in reducing poor health-seeking behaviours among pregnant women.",

For example, the result of 55 pregnant women infected with COVID-19 and 46 neonates were reported with no explicit indication of vertical transmission [7] . However, there is a correlation between COVID-19 and comorbidities among pregnant women [8] . Since the physiological and mechanical changes in pregnancy accelerate the vulnerability to infections, if the cardiorespiratory system is affected, it may lead to rapid progression to respiratory failure among pregnant women [9] . Studies have equally documented mental health issues related to the COVID-19 pandemic [10, 11] . Studies have shown that complications such as Anaemia, haemorrhage, lower limb oedema, laceration, foetal discharge, foetal obstruction, sepsis, fistula, and puerperal psychosis contribute largely to maternal mortality during pregnancy, delivery, and after childbirth.",

The first delay has been attributed to socio-cultural dynamics on who makes decisions in the household, the pregnant women's financial ability, and previous negative birth experience [20] . Delays in arriving at health facilities have been reported to be caused by long distances to health facilities, lack of adequate and affordable public and private transport systems, and inaccessibility of the health facilities due to the rough terrains espcially in resource limited settings [21] . The third delay has been explained in the context of lack of or limited human resources for health, inadequacies in medical supplies, and lack of adequate referral systems [1, 22, 23, 24, 25] .",

A total of twenty-six pregnant women participated in the present study. This was done through purposive sampling as the study population's demographics were comparatively homogeneous. The inclusion criteria for study participants was (i) having attended at least one ANC visit, (ii) ability to speak in either Swahili or English language, (iii) had lived in the catchment area for at least six months before the onset of the pandemic and (iv) aged between 18-45 years. The first two focus group discussions (FGDs) had seven participants and the last two FGDs had six participants respectively. In the current study, the saturation principle was reached after undertaking the 4 th FGD when no new emerging themes were being realized. On average each of the four FGDs took 45-54 min and FGDs were undertaken in four centralized locations where the study participants would access with ease. Four community health workers were trained and tasked with identifying and recruiting the study participants. Two research assistants with a background in midwifery and who had been trained on the scope of the current study undertook the data collection. The research assistants were further assessed on their familiarity with the \"Three Delays\" theoretical framework that was being employed in the current study.",

Modifications were done where deemed necessary. All the FGDs were audio-recorded with consent from the study participants and field notes were also taken during the FGDs.",

This was followed by re-organizing the data according to the emerging model. The third step was to merge codes with more sub-themes and themes, and through an inductive methodology, the relationship between the generated codes, sub-themes and themes was reached. To avoid omitting any relevant and important data, the datasets were re-read again to ensure that the generated themes were in tandem with the initial datasets.",

The first theme was delay related to the fear of the COVID-19 pandemic at an individual and community level, which impacted the pregnant women's decision to go for regular antenatal care visits at the health facilities. The second theme was the delays related to reaching health facilities due to restrictions that were put in place to curb the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic. The third theme was delays related to the experience of pregnant women at healthcare facilities. Each of the themes and sub-themes is explained, including direct quotes from the study participants. Delays related to fear of the COVID-19 pandemic was discussed in all the FGDs in details and three sub-themes emerged.

Integrating them into an improved healthcare system as community health workers or as mother-mentors can be an effective way of reducing maternal and perinatal mortality. In some developing countries, the TBAs have been oriented to play a role in accompanying expectant women to health facilities for maternal health services [33] .",
