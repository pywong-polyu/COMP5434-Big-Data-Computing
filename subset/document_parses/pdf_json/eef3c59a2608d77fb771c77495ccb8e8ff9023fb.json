These include unprecedented avoidance of health facilities, reduced health facility staffing, and supply chain destabilisation with resulting stockouts of contraceptive commodities, among other essential drugs. 1 For those with the means to access contraceptives in the private sector or via direct-to-consumer options, circumventing these barriers is possible. For women who rely on smaller public facilities, especially in rural and unstable areas, a lack of access to muchneeded reproductive care has become the unfortunate reality. At our tertiary care facility in Western Kenya, the family planning clinic has scrambled to maintain a consistent supply and access to contracept those women most in need, but the challenges described above have resulted in severely reduced hours of operation and practitioner availability, with dwindling patient numbers.",

Adolescents who are out of school are at increased risk of unplanned pregnancies, either as a result of sexual exploration with their peers, \"survival sex\" for income, or violence from sexual aggressors. 3 More than 18 million adolescents ages 10-19 become pregnant every year. In response, global aid was beginning to shift its focus to the reproductive health needs of adolescent girls. In Kenya, improved policies in the public sector designed to increase graduation from primary school and matriculation in secondary school were recently instituted. This came in the wake of a number of large international summits, such as Women Deliver 2019, and the Nairobi Summit on ICPD25. The country has seen a significant increase in sexual health education outreach with the development of youth-friendly health centres at county health facilities. Halting this much-needed progress and enforcing prolonged school closures will once again make these girls more vulnerable, particularly in their reproductive health needs.",

Mass un-and under-employment are destabilising employer-based insurance systems, making even basic care, like contraception, unaffordable. Despite the World Health Organization's declaration that abortion is essential health care, multiple American states have attempted to restrict access to abortion services for the purported reason of preserving PPE.

Worse still, the elevated rates of IPV persisted for a decade after both natural disasters. 6, 7 In Kenya, the mandated social distancing, institution of a dusk-todawn curfew, and the disbanding of hawkers' stalls, are having serious adverse economic impacts on a population that lives almost entirely in the informal sector. In North America, shelter closures and physical isolation limit women seeking an escape from unsafe home situations.

Governments, ministries of health, and individual facilities need to develop directed outreach to address reproductive care during the pandemic. Access to contraception and safe abortion must be regarded as essential, and appropriate information needs to be disseminated to vulnerable women and girls. Swift action must be taken to ensure supply chains for reproductive health commodities remain open. We need appropriate provision and compensation for healthcare providers.
