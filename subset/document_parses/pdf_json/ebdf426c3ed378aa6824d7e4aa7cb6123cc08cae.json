The median time to acceptance for COVID-19 was lower than that for human influenza (8 vs. 92 days). The median time to publication for COVID-19 articles was shorter than those on human influenza (12 vs. 16 days); 47.0% of COVID-19 research articles were accepted within the first week of submission, and 19.5% within one day. There were 82 retractions and withdrawals for COVID-19 articles, 1 for human influenza, and 5 for articles that contain both terms; these were mainly related to ethical misconduct, and 27 (31.0%) were published by the same group of authors in one highest-quartile journal. Conclusions. The conundrum between fast publishing and adequate standards is shown in this analysis of COVID-19 research articles. The speed of acceptance for COVID-19 manuscripts was 11.5 times faster than for human influenza. The high number of acceptances within a day or week of submission and the number of retractions and withdrawals of COVID-19 papers might be a warning sign about the possible lack of a quality control process in scientific publishing and the peer review process.",

This process was introduced at the end of the 19th century to ensure quality and impartiality of the content in publications. Nevertheless, it is not exempt from criticism, mainly due to possible bias and the increased editorial processing time it may entail (8, 9) . Furthermore, the accelerated production of information during the pandemic has taken academic publishing by surprise. The balance between reporting novel and breakthrough data is influenced by a continuously changing emergent global disease and the usual editorial process and turnaround times. As a result, academic publishing has been highly criticized during the pandemic, generating questions about the operation of the peer review process and the editorial decisions for manuscript publication. Some authors have criticized this accelerated production of information and have warned about an increase in retractions (3, 10, 11) .",

In addition, the editorial processing time of COVID-19 manuscripts was faster than the reported publication turnaround time of other subjects, which averages 4-5 months (14, 15) . TA, which accounts for the peer review and editorial assessment stages, was primarily responsible for this finding. Almost 50% of the COVID-19 published articles were accepted for publication within one week and 20% within one day of receipt by the editorial office. concluded that the time between submission and publication had decreased on average by 49% for coronavirus-related articles, mainly due to a decrease in peer review stage time. On the contrary, the publication process was not faster when analyzing articles not related to COVID-19 (16). The shorter editorial process, which made articles available quickly, was initially thought to be an advantage in describing and studying a new disease. However, it seems that a flawed peer review process during the first year of the pandemic may have been, at least in part, the reason for the shorter editorial process in many cases. The weakness of this crucial stage in quality control (i.e., scientific, ethical, relevance) might be related to an increase in the rate of errata and retractions (13) , which is higher than for influenza and an estimated three times higher than for other viruses related to pandemics or epidemics (3, 18) . Furthermore, because the reported time to retraction in previous studies is usually between two and three years, the number of retracted COVID-19 manuscripts will likely increase in the following years (19) .",

M\u00e9todos. Estudo descritivo-anal\u00edtico. Foi realizada uma busca no PubMed usando os descritores MeSH \"human influenza\" e \"COVID-19\". O tempo at\u00e9 a aceita\u00e7\u00e3o (da submiss\u00e3o \u00e0 aceita\u00e7\u00e3o) e o tempo at\u00e9 a publica\u00e7\u00e3o (da aceita\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 publica\u00e7\u00e3o) foram comparados. Retrata\u00e7\u00f5es e suspens\u00f5es foram analisadas qualitativa e quantitativamente. Resultados. Foram publicados 31 319 artigos de pesquisa sobre a COVID-19 e 4 287 sobre a gripe humana em 2020. O tempo m\u00e9dio de aceita\u00e7\u00e3o de artigos sobre COVID-19 foi menor que o de artigos sobre gripe humana (8 versus 92 dias). O tempo m\u00e9dio at\u00e9 publica\u00e7\u00e3o dos artigos sobre COVID-19 foi menor que o de artigos sobre gripe humana (12 versus 16 dias); 47,0% dos artigos sobre COVID-19 foram aceitos na primeira semana ap\u00f3s a submiss\u00e3o, e 19,5%, dentro de um dia. Houve 82 retrata\u00e7\u00f5es e suspens\u00f5es de artigos sobre COVID-19, 1 sobre gripe humana, e 5 de artigos que continham ambos os termos, principalmente relacionadas a m\u00e1 conduta \u00e9tica; 27 (31,0%) desses artigos foram publicados pelo mesmo grupo de autores, em uma revista do mais alto quartil. Conclus\u00f5es. O dilema entre publicar rapidamente e manter padr\u00f5es adequados fica claro nesta an\u00e1lise de artigos sobre COVID-19. Manuscritos sobre COVID-19 foram aceitos 11,5 vezes mais rapidamente do que artigos sobre gripe humana. O alto n\u00famero de aceita\u00e7\u00f5es em um dia ou semana ap\u00f3s a submiss\u00e3o e o n\u00famero de retrata\u00e7\u00f5es e suspens\u00f5es de artigos sobre COVID-19 alertam sobre uma poss\u00edvel falta de controle de qualidade na publica\u00e7\u00e3o cient\u00edfica e no processo de revis\u00e3o por pares.",
