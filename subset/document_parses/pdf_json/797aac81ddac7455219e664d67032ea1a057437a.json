Early diagnosis of COVID-19 enables timely treatment and the implementation of public health measures. We validated the sensitivity, specificity, precision, linearity, accuracy, and robustness of the RT-qPCR assay for SARS-CoV-2 detection and compared its performance with that of several EUA-approved kits. Our RT-qPCR assay was highly specific for SARS-CoV-2 as demonstrated by not amplifying 13 other viruses that cause respiratory diseases. The assay showed high linearity using a viral isolate from a patient with known COVID-19 as well as plasmids containing target SARS-CoV-2 genes as templates. The assay showed good repeatability and reproducibility with a coefficient of variation of 3%, and a SARS-CoV-2 limit of detection of 1 PFU/mL. The RT-qPCR-based assay is highly effective and can facilitate the early diagnosis of COVID-19 without the use of EUA-approved kits or reagents in the Republic of Korea.",

Since its initial emergence in Wuhan, China in late 2019, COVID-19 has rapidly spread worldwide 2 . COVID-19 is caused by SARS-CoV-2, with its clinical symptoms including dyspnea, cough, and mild respiratory symptoms that progress to pneumonia. It is difficult to distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other common respiratory viruses such as influenza viruses, because of their highly similar symptoms 8 . A genetic assay with high specificity is necessary to detect SARS-CoV-2.",
