A distinguishing feature of this new model is that it allows us to consider a set up under general latency and infectious period distributions. To some extent, queuing systems with infinitely many servers and a Markov chain with time-varying transition rate are the very technical underpinning of the paper. Although more general, the Markov chain is as tractable as previous models for exponentially distributed latency and infection periods. It is also significantly simpler and more tractable than semi-Markov models with a similar level of generality. Based on the notion of stochastic stability, we derive a sufficient condition for a shrinking epidemic in terms of the queuing system's occupation rate that drives the dynamics. Relying on this condition, we propose a class of ad-hoc stabilising mitigation strategies that seek to keep a balanced occupation rate after a prescribed mitigation-free period. We validate the approach in the light of recent data on the COVID-19 epidemic and assess the effect of different stabilising strategies. The results suggest that it is possible to curb the epidemic with various occupation rate levels, as long as the mitigation is not excessively procrastinated.",

Stochastic epidemic models (Allen, 2008; Britton, 2010) were therefore designed to better capture some of these uncertainties and provide more realistic support for decision making.",

Trapman and Bootsma (2009) made use of this framework to demonstrate the advantage of an M/G/1 queuing model to estimate the size of an epidemic at the time of detection. Some time later, classical M/M/S queues were utilised to estimate the whole outbreak of the Ebola virus (Dike et al., 2016) . More recently, Barraza et al. (2020) employed pure Birth processes to fit data from the initial stages of the COVID-19 epidemic. Underpinning the analysis is the theory of Markov processes (Br\u00e9maud, 1999 ), used to model the transition of individuals among the SIR populations.",

A possible alternative is to develop more complex block-structured Markov chains that can mimic certain types of non-exponential infection times (Lef\u00e8vre and Simon, 2020; \u0130\u015flier et al., 2020) .

            "text": "A thorough treatment of general infection times demands a class of semi-Markov processes known as piecewise-deterministic processes (PDP) (Davis, 1993) . Clancy (2014) Inspired by the recent COVID-19 outbreak, this paper uses the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, removed ) framework, which is analogous to SIR except for considering a latency period, whereby a recently infected individual does not manifest the disease nor can transmit it for a limited period after acquiring the illness. In addition to being more general, such a modelling choice is adequate for the COVID-19 epidemic, given its non-negligible latency period (Backer et al., 2020) . Examples of stochastic SEIR models (Artalejo et al., 2015; Lopez-Herrero, 2017; Amador and Lopez-Herrero, 2018 ) assume exponentially distributed latency and infection periods. The first work concerns the duration of the outbreak, the second the transmission rate per infected person and the latter the epidemic size. This paper builds upon previous literature (Trapman and Bootsma, 2009) with innovative use of two M t /G/\u221e models to describe the epidemic's stochastic behaviour. However, whilst the M/G/1 queue in (Trapman and Bootsma, 2009) models the epidemic up to the time of detection, the proposed model covers the whole outbreak. Such a generalisation hinges on two unique novelties. Firstly, we describe the input process as a time-varying Poisson process, which enables us to describe the variation of infection rates as a function of the system's dynamics. Secondly, by realising that there are no limits in the number of new infections and considering that conditions progress in parallel, we select a queuing model with infinitely many servers.",

Due to the larger peak, we are able to relax the mitigation earlier and more rapidly, reaching a full relaxation just after seven months. However, since there are still susceptible individuals in the population, mitigation has to re-start from day 396 onwards to avoid a recrudescence of the epidemic. The Case F illustrates the increasingly reduced flexibility that results from a belated mitigation. Observe in Figure 8 that the overall effect of the mitigation is limited. Although we are able to halve the peak of infections with respect to the unmitigated epidemic (Case A), with the total of simultaneous infections peaking at 31% by day 121, the evolution of the epidemic still resembles the unmitigated case. High levels of control are demanded at the beginning of the mitigation period to contain the spike in infections. Still, as the removed population reaches about 50%, the mitigation is dropped because the bulk of the population is either removed, infected or exposed. The disease then stabilises, but because 1% of the population is still susceptible, enforced mitigation is necessary again to avoid another spike of the epidemic around day 250. Table 6 assesses the effect of varying the target occupation level from 60% to 90% in regular intervals. To account for the stochastic fluctuations and prevent biases, Figures 10 to 13 show the median of 100 realisations of the stochastic system within a two-year interval. Figure 10 presents the results for Case H. As one can observe, the number of infected people peaks around 18% on day 114. As expected, the stronger mitigation has no effect in the early stages and is not able to prevent a similar peak as in the baseline (Case E). However, as time elapses we can notice that the increased mitigation produces a much more pronounced decrease in infections.",

In effect, delays tend to produce persistent infection levels over time, even in the presence of mitigation, thereby increasing the spread even though the infection curves are effectively flattened.

However, the proposed model innovates by considering a timevarying input rate \u03bb(t) = \u03b2S(t)I(t) to cover the epidemic's evolution over time.Observe inFigure 2that each departure from Queue 1 represents a decrease of one infected individual. In turn, each arrival corresponds to a new exposition, i.e. a susceptible individual contracting the disease in its latent stage.

To facilitate the interpretation, the number of individuals in each SEIR compartment is depicted as a percentage of the total population. One can see that the epidemic spreads rapidly, with the number of infected individuals peaking around 64% of the population after 128 days. The epidemic then starts to shrink due to the decrease in the susceptible population, until it finally subsides around the 165 th day. Observe from Figure 4 that Case B starts the mitigation early in the epidemic, with low levels of infection. The upper plot conveys full results andin the lower plot we zoom in to detail the evolution of the exposed, infected and removed populations. The results illustrate the effectiveness of the mitigation policy. Observe that the mitigation policy successfully prevents the spread of the disease, maintaining 99.6% of the population healthy over the whole two-year interval, whereas the removed population reaches 0.4% at the end of that interval. Controlling the epidemic, however, demands very high levels of mitigation that oscillate and stabilise around 0.875. It is noteworthy that de-",

One can see that the mitigating actions are similar, tend to stabilise around the same value and are equally sufficient to curb the epidemic.The difference with respect to Case B is a rather steep increase in the final number of individuals that catch the disease at some point, represented by the removed population. This number increases from 0.4% in Case B to around 17% in Case C, thus highlighting the sensitivity of the spread with respect to mitigation delay. The results also show that a three-week delay produces a large increment in the peak of infections, for even though this peak only reaches around 1% of the population, it is about four times as large as it would be if the mitigation strategy started 21 days earlier.Figures 6 features the results for Case D. Despite an extra delay of one week with respect to Case C, it is still possible to flatten the curve and prevent an uncontrollable increase of the epidemic. Nonetheless, the extra week produces a peak of infections five times as large as in Case C, with 5% of people being infected 107 days after the outset of the epidemic. The total removed population skyrockets from about 17% in Case C to about 90% in Case D,",
