Additionally, in 2020/21, a significant proportion of resources were directed towards the pandemic response. To reduce the risk of the dual threat caused by seasonal influenza and COVID-19, the UK government expanded the eligibility criteria for flu vaccinations to include additional cohorts, for example those over the age of 50, shielding households and all school year groups up to Year 7. Furthermore, the targets for uptake in each cohort were set to minimum 75%, making the 2020/21 flu programme the largest one to date in the history of the NHS. 10 Based on NHS England estimates for the North East Key stakeholders planning and delivering the 2020/21 flu vaccination programme in Yorkshire and the Humber recognised a workforce gap created by programme expansion as part of the COVID-19 pandemic response. Foundation dentists were invited to support the flu programme and later, the COVID-19 vaccination programme.",

The key aspect of success common to all areas was organisational capacity to resolve host-employment arrangements and competency sign-off for the allocated FDs. The first area to use FDs was Humber Coast and Vale with mobilisation from mid-October and competency sign-off for all 29 allocated trainees. One GP federation there offered to hold the honorary contracts for all trainees in that region and they set-up memoranda of understanding with the other CCGs to allow FDs mobilisation in their area. Ultimately, the other CCGs failed to mobilise the offer and all FDs were utilised by the federation. In this way, the GP federation was pivotal to successful mobilisation with FDs in the vaccination programme within that area.",

Another barrier was represented by the complexities around hostemployment arrangements, competency sign-off and the lack of understanding of the FDs training and skillset. This view was shared by eight participants and it was consistent with feedback from the FD survey. Additionally, host organisations had varying capacity for setting-up multiple honorary contracts, facilitating competency sign-off and had varying vaccine supply issues. Five participants highlighted communication issues between host organisations and FDs, as well as between host organisations, the project team and other stakeholders. Also, five participants reported that structural differences between providers and the different delivery models were a potential barrier. The absence of an existing framework and the high-paced implementation were considered barriers by four participants. Other barriers were the lack of an existing precedent, project complexity, lack of flexibility around vaccination days, interprofessional barriers, lack of resources and organisational politics. The main facilitator reported by five participants was the project team. Two participants discussed the support of various organisations such as Health Education England, NHS England and Improvement, Senior Responsible Office leads and ICSs, local medical committees, educational supervisors etc. Having large healthcare federations be able to host the honorary contracts and large vaccination sites, as well as FDs' professionalism, communications skills and ability to integrate in multidisciplinary teams, were also considered a facilitator by two participants. Other facilitators were the sense of contribution to the pandemic response and the low risk of delivering the programme by understanding the skills and training of FDs.",

This was further helped by the lead consultant having a dual role as both consultant in dental public health and screenings and immunisations lead (SES). This was a key advantage for facilitating the communication between the various organisations involved in the vaccination programmes and the dental stakeholders. A steering group provided the tools for organisations to develop local arrangements and share best practice. It was important to identify and engage with early adaptors and innovators to champion against organisational resistance to change and promote working across the professional boundaries created by the healthcare system. 19 Feedback from receiving organisations and FDs suggested that one of the main barriers was the lack of understanding of the FD skillset. The detached delivery of dental care from other healthcare services contributed to a lack of understanding of the dental workforce skillset. Future research should explore opportunities for addressing these barriers, especially in the light of the changing demographics and increasing numbers of people with multimorbidities who might benefit from a more person-centred, multidisciplinary approach between healthcare professionals. 20, 21 The main limitation of this evaluation was around the collection of FD activity data. Different immunisation providers used different systems to record the numbers of vaccinations, raising significant challenges for data collection. FD activity regarding vaccinations was based on estimates provided by host organisations.",

Dental care provision in the context of the new Standard Operating Procedures and Infection Prevention and Control Guidance resulted in a significant reduction of the number of patients that could be seen by FDs. 6, 7 Anecdotal evidence suggests that certain FD training practices could only offer training opportunities on a limited number of days a week in autumn 2020. The resulting workforce capacity created by this unique situation was utilised in a creative manner to identify opportunities to fulfil FD training competencies. By mobilising the workforce to do 'the right thing at the right time' and support the pandemic response in a 'Dunkirk spirit' , FDs had a unique opportunity to be involved in the wider structures of primary care and demonstrate the value of collaboration between medicine and dentistry. 25 The pandemic provided a circuit breaker in our daily routine and an opportunity to reflect on our role and the value of our practice. 26 Structural, cultural and economic change that goes beyond dental contract reform is needed with a strong focus on prevention and reduction of inequalities. 21, 24 The upcoming imminent changes in the NHS present an opportunity for commissioning organisations and regulatory bodies to consider new structures for a more integrated care where dentistry is an active part of the primary care offer in order to support a person focused approach. 27, 28, 29 As Davie Hollis said, 'in the rush to return to normal, use this time to consider which parts of normal are worth rushing back to.
