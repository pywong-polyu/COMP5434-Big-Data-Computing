Computer-aided expert systems are needed due to the inadequacy of the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction kit, which is widely used in the diagnosis of this disease. Undoubtedly, expert systems that provide effective solutions to many problems will be very useful in the detection of Covid-19 disease, especially when unskilled personnel and financial deficiencies in underdeveloped countries are taken into consideration. In the literature, there are numerous machine learning approaches built with different classifiers in the detection of this disease. This paper proposes an approach based on deep learning which detects Covid-19 and no-finding cases using chest X-ray images. Here, the classification performance of the Bi-LSTM network on the deep features was compared with the Deep Neural Network within the frame of the fivefold cross-validation technique. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and precision metrics were used to evaluate the classification performance of the trained models. Bi-LSTM network presented better performance compare to DNN with 97.6% value of high accuracy despite the few numbers of Covid-19 images in the dataset. In addition, it is understood that concatenated deep features more meaningful than deep features obtained with pre-trained networks by one by, as well. Consequently, it is thought that the proposed study based on the Bi-LSTM network and concatenated deep features will be noteworthy in the design of highly sensitive automated Covid-19 monitoring systems.",

The virus caused an epidemic and affected the whole world economy. The global impact of this disease, which can be seen in both humans and animals, is not yet known, and its spread rate is quite high [2] . The coronavirus disease, which shows up in China in late 2019 and showed many different symptoms, affected millions of people [3] . The virus has spread to many countries through cross-country transport. The full symptoms of Covid-19 in an infected person can appear in about 14 days. Currently, there is no complete treatment method or medicine to get rid of this disease [4] . Early diagnosis of the symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 disease are difficult [5] . A kit called reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction is used to diagnose this disease [6] . Inadequacy of this kit has been one of the biggest threats in preventing the rapid spread of the coronavirus [7] . During this time, people with the virus may have transmitted the virus to other people. To prevent this, a solution must be found that will detect the presence of the disease more quickly in people with Covid-19 [8] . Consequently, the quick spread of this disease and the negatives on people necessitate early diagnosis of this disease [9] .",

But, using CT images in the diagnosis of the Covid-19 has disadvantages such as the fact that many hospitals do not have the necessary equipment to obtain the CT image and the cost of tomographic imaging is high. Disinfection time between patients is approximately 15 min. Different from CT imaging, chest X-ray imaging is widely used for detecting Covid-19 as it requires both short imaging time and low cost [13] . This technique minimizes the possibility of spreading the virus and also exposes the patient to lower doses of ionizing radiation. Moreover, this technique costs less than a CT scan. However, detecting Covid-19 from these images is often quite a complex task, as it has similarities with other types of viral pneumonia [14] .",

Therefore, there is a great need for quick and accurate Covid-19 automatic diagnosis. In this context, artificial intelligence approaches including deep learning architectures are mostly used to decrease the workload of radiologists [15] . The financial costs of diagnostic laboratory kits are an important problem in fighting the disease especially for developing and underdeveloped countries [17] . Clinicians and field experts can use deep learning-based expert systems for early detection of Covid-19 [14] . The recent popularity of deep learning architectures that offer high performance has given the opportunity to use models based on these architectures effectively. Deep learning methods, as used in many other fields, can be successfully applied in the fixation and classification of various diseases in the medical field without the need for the handy craft features required for machine learning.",

While the dropout layers were added to prevent overfitting for both deep neural networks, the adaptive moment estimation algorithm (Adam) was used in the training process with a 0.001 learning rate value. The model checkpoint method was applied to save the best weights of the model. Therefore, the network parameters were load at the point of the maximum validation accuracy.

The performance of the DNN model built from scratch on the feature sets extracted by transfer learning from the image set was examined (Scenario A). The performances of the Bi-LSTM model built from scratch on these feature sets were discussed (Scenario B). Also, the performances of the Bi-LSTM and DNN on the concatenated deep features were also examined (Scenario C). With these scenarios, it is aimed to determine a reliable and successful model by comparing the performances of different deep learning models. Table 2 presents the average Acc, Sen, Spe and Pre values achieved by the models built in this study. By examining the performances of the DNN and Bi-LSTM models used in the classification of deep features extracted from each pre-trained model in Table 2 , it was seen that the Bi-LSTM model presented the best performance on the concatenated deep features. While DNN model achieved 95.84% value of average accuracy, Bi-LSTM achieved 97.6% value of (1) Sen = #TP #TP + #FN , Receiver operating characteristic curves which present the performance of the models built in this study on test data are presented in Fig. 6 . It could be seen that the Bi-LSTM model has good classification performance on the test sets including the concatenated deep features for each fold. Moreover, the highest ROC AUC scores with Bi-LSTM was also stand out on these deep features set.",

As can be seen by examining the overlapped confusion matrix results, false negatives presented by DNN quite high compare to the Bi-LSTM network for all deep features extracted by pre-trained models. But, false positives presented by Bi-LSTM slightly high than DNN for deep features extracted by ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121 models. In the literature, there are many models that used different classifiers or for detecting Covid-19 disease. The best model obtained by the Bi-LSTM network with an acceptable classification performance was compared with other studies within the frame of two-class classification (Covid-19 and no-finding cases). The Bi-LSTM network achieved 97.6% average accuracy in classifying the concatenated deep features. Table 3 presents the comparison of the proposed study and others in the literature. Specifically, the proposed method achieves good performance on the no-finding cases compared to Covid-19 cases. In spite of the classification accuracy of the proposed model slightly low from the studies of Nayak et. [4] and T\u00fcrko\u011flu [12] , it is successful compared to the studies of Sethy and Behera [49] . Nayak et al. [4] demonstrated higher success compared to the model proposed in this study, but they used hold-out technique, which is called a simple technique, in their study. Moreover, the proposed model presented a significant performance improvement compared to the studies performed on the CT images except for the study of Turko\u011flu [12] . In addition, some of the limitations of this study may be clear in future research. In particular, many more samples of Covid-19 cases are needed for a more in-depth analysis. The low number of Covid-19 images limits model performance and may result in a biased result.",

Experiments involving the comparison of DNN and Bi-LSTM models on deep features in this study differ from the approaches in the literature and therefore it is thought to contain a unique approach. In experiments, firstly, three different pre-trained models were used to compare their distinctive characteristics. According to the experiments, in terms of machine learning, the concatenated deep features are more meaningful than the deep features obtained individually by pre-trained networks. As seen from overlapped matrices, the concatenated deep features are an encouraging result, with optimal results with the lowest number of FN (11) and FP (4) classification accuracy obtained, the model proposed could be used in the development of expert systems to be used in real clinical environments. Such an expert system to be developed using a low-cost based on deep learning architecture will help field experts to diagnose Covid-19 disease quickly and also down the errors arising from the subjective opinions of experts. In summary, the proposed study indicates that the Bi-LSTM is able to classify Covid-19 and no-finding cases, even with a little number of training images and a small number of Covid19 images. The proposed model can help radiologists or field experts for accurate and robust diagnosis of Covid-19 infection. Besides, the performance of this system can be increased by using different deep learning architectures and also by applying data augmentation techniques. The approach proposed in this study can be used as a low-cost tool that can provide faster and more accurate recognition of the virus to prevent its spread.",

They obtained X-ray images which are not including text and other unnecessary information using YOLO in their study. They accomplished the highest recognition accuracy of 93.48% with the EfficientNet model [2]. Shah et al. examined the performances of different deep learning techniques to accurate and impetuous Covid-19 detecting. In their study, the VGG-19 outperformed others with an accuracy of 94.52% [46]. Pathak et al. conducted experimental studies by applying a deep transfer learning approach and tenfold cross-validation to detect the Covid-19 disease. They obtained efficient results with 93.0189% value of accuracy by using the ResNet-50 network [47].
