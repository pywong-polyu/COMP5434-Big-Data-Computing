Patients under MV for more than 24 h, meeting weaning criteria and having failed the first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) underwent a corticotropin stimulation test, with assessment of total blood cortisol levels immediately before (T 0 ) 0.25 mg iv of tetracosactrin and 30 and 60 min afterward. \u0394 max was defined as the difference between the maximal value after the test and T 0 . CIRCI was defined as T 0 < 10 \u03bcg/dL (276 nmol/L) and/or \u0394 max < 9 \u03bcg/dL (248 nmol/L) and inadequate adrenal reserve as \u0394 max < 9 \u03bcg/dL. Biomarkers (natriuretic peptide and protidemia) sampling and echocardiograms were performed during the second SBT and were used to diagnose WiPO, which was defined according to two definitions (one liberal and one conservative) derived from recent publications on the topic. Successful extubation was defined as patient alive without reintubation 7 days after extubation. A competing risk analysis was used to assess extubation failure and mortality.",

            "text": "Some adrenal profiles derived from corticotropin stimulation test are usually associated with poor outcomes, as alteration of cardiac and vascular functions, prolonged duration of mechanical ventilation (MV) and higher mortality [3, 4] . The pathophysiology of weaning failure is complex [5] , but weaning-induced pulmonary oedema (WiPO) is one of its major established causes [6, 7] . During the weaning process, the use of spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) is a real stress test [8] , which may imply elevation of cortisol level to meet the cardiorespiratory physiological demand. The HPA axis may, therefore, play a major role in the response to the stress induced by ventilator weaning. Because adrenal insufficiency may impair cardiac function [9] , we hypothesized that CIRCI may increase WiPO incidence. Conversely, an inadequate adrenal response may be associated with difficult weaning. Studies on the role of adrenal function in weaning failure are scarce [10] . The aims of this study were to evaluate the prevalence of adrenal insufficiency during difficult weaning from MV, and its possible relation with WiPO.",

Criteria for SBT failure were respiratory rate \u2265 35 breaths/minute or increase \u2265 50%, SpO 2 \u2264 90% or PaO 2 \u2264 50 mmHg (with FiO 2 \u2265 50%), heart rate \u2265 140 beats/minute, new-onset of supraventricular or ventricular arrhythmia, systolic arterial pressure > 180 or < 90 mmHg, alteration of consciousness, diaphoresis or any signs of respiratory distress [12, 13] . Patients who failed the first SBT were included in the study. A second SBT, consisting of a 2-h T-piece trial [14] was performed within 24 h after the first SBT in all included patients.

Several biomarkers (B-type natriuretic peptide, troponin, protein) were measured during second SBT to assess WiPO. Because there is no non-invasive consensual definition of WiPO, we considered three criteria proposed in the recent literature: (i) echocardiographic signs of increased left atrial pressure at the end of the SBT: E/A ratio > 0.95 and E/e\u2032 ratio > 8.5 [19] ; (ii) an increase of BNP (absolute change \u2265 48 ng/L) or NT-proBNP (absolute change \u2265 21 ng/L) concentration during the SBT [20] ; and (iii) an increase of protein concentration (relative change > 6%) during the SBT [21] . We further combined these criteria into two definitions of WiPO, as follows: a conservative definition (when at least two criteria were fulfilled), and a liberal definition (when at least one criterion was fulfilled) [11] . As per our weaning protocol and current guidelines [13] , we performed a cuff leak test in selected patients at high risk of post-extubation stridor; no patient required a preventive or curative steroid treatment for stridor.",

In this context, standard survival methods (Kaplan-Meier method and Cox model) are inappropriate, because they assume that censoring is non-informative and specific competing risk methods need to be considered. We, therefore, used a competing risk model (cumulative incidence function of the Gray model) [24] to properly estimate the effect of adrenal function on weaning outcome (up to day 28), while considering death as a competing event. The strength of the association between each variable and the outcome was assessed using the sub-hazard ratio associated with the cumulative incidence function estimated using the cmprsk package developed by Gray in the R software (http:// biowww. dfci. harva rd. edu/ ~gray/ cmprsk_ 2.1-4. tar. gz).

This adrenal insufficiency was associated with a longer weaning period [4, 10] and a higher mortality [25] . Moreover, in recent randomized controlled trials assessing the benefit of corticosteroid therapy in septic shock, time to weaning from MV was shorter in the intervention group than the placebo group [26, 27] . However, these studies and ours do not allow to use CIRCI to select for glucocorticoid replacement during ventilator weaning. The usefulness of corticosteroid on weaning from mechanical ventilation could be mediated by hemodynamic improvement and/or inflammation blunting. To date, only one study had specifically evaluated adrenal insufficiency during ventilator weaning [10] . In this cohort of patients under MV for more than 72 h, patients were assessed for adrenal function and those with adrenal insufficiency were randomized to receive 50 mg intravenous hydrocortisone every 6 h or a placebo. In this trial [10] , extubation success was comparable in the adequate adrenal reserve group (88%) and intervention group (91%); and these rates were both higher than those of the placebo group (69%), the latter having a longer weaning duration. The pathophysiological mechanisms underlying these results remain unclear.",

Our research group previously showed a close association between adrenal insufficiency and cardiac failure in patients with cardiogenic shock or septic cardiomyopathy [16, 29] . However, we found no association between CIRCI and WiPO in the present cohort. CIRCI may affect weaning outcome via other pathways of stress response. Weaning-induced stress response has been highlighted in different critical care settings including neonatal [30] , surgical [31] , or medical [6] ICU patient groups. Besides the cardiovascular system, the stress response may involve other major functions of the respiratory or immunologic system. Steroid stress dose administration may improve altered immune response in patients undergoing weaning [28, 32, 33] , but we did not specifically assess ventilatorassociated pneumonia during the weaning phase.

Limitations of our study include the monocentric setting and the limited sample size, which precluded any robust multivariable analysis of factors associated with extubation failure or CIRCI. In addition, several potential confounding factors can limit the interpretation of these results. Etomidate is a common hypnotic agent, frequently used in rapid sequence intubation in our center and the best-known drug to interfere with cortisol metabolism. A single bolus of etomidate is a major determinant of CIRCI for at least 24-48 h [25, 34] . However, the possible influence of this drug on our data is minimized by the systematic use of etomidate in all intubated patients, and the relatively long delay (median of 5 days) between intubation and the initiation of weaning. Moreover, some patients (n = 10, 13%) transiently receiving steroids (not long-term users and not currently under steroids at time of stimulation test) were included and may constitute a limit. However, their adrenal profile (T 0 and \u0394 max ) did not significantly differ from that of their counterparts. Finally, the more important limitation is probably the interpretation of the corticotropin stimulation test in these critically ill patients during a de-escalation phase. Measure of total plasmatic cortisol may not accurately reflect his real activity, especially Table 3 Weaning-induced pulmonary oedema according to adrenal reserve",

Although we found no difference in protidemia level according to adrenal function, free cortisol is probably more suitable [35] . Furthermore, Peeters et al. [36] have recently suggested that corticotropin stimulation test may not provide reliable information on adrenal insufficiency and may not exclude CIRCI in critically ill patients after a prolonged ICU stay (more than 7 days). In the specific population of critically ill patients with difficult weaning, further studies are warranted with plasmatic free cortisol to confirm our results.",
