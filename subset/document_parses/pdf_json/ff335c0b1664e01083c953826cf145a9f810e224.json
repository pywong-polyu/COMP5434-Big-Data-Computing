We observed a decrease of antibody titers among users of HNB tobacco products relative to never smokers, although the reduction was less than that associated with cigarette smoking. This could be ascribed to the nicotine contained in HNB tobacco products, the amount of which in the fillers and the mainstream smoke is comparable to those of conventional cigarettes. 9, 16 Experimental studies showed that chronic exposure to nicotine inhibited antibody-forming cell response, impaired antigen-mediated signaling in T cells, and induced T cell anergy. 15 The present finding, together with experimental data, adds evidence to support the adverse effect of HNB tobacco product use against immunogenicity to the COVID-19 vaccination.",

This finding is at variance with the hypothesis derived from mechanistic inference; moderate alcohol drinking can boost antibody response by decreasing the level of pathological inflammation and increasing circulating immunoglobulins and plasma antioxidants levels 10 .

We should also acknowledge study limitations. First, as this study is cross-sectional, we cannot determine whether smoking and alcohol use were associated with the surge of antibodies in response to vaccination or the decay of antibodies over time. Second, the number of exclusive HNB tobacco users was not large enough to detect the reduction of IgG titers among them with statistical significance. Third, we did not measure neutralizing antibody, a more reliable marker of immunogenicity. Nevertheless, spike IgG antibody titers measured with the assay we employed are known to well correlate with neutralizing antibody titers (spearman's \u03c1 =0.71, 95% CI: 0.63-0.77). 19 Finally, many East Asians are genetically deficient in one of the enzymes involved in metabolizing alcohol (aldehyde dehydrogenase); 11 thus, the present finding regarding alcohol use may not be observed in populations with different genetic background.",
