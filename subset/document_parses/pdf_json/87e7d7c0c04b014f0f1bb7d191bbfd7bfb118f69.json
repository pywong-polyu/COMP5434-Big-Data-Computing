Collection of the sample as advised by manufacturers' and local health authorities' instructions. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ As expected, this testing cascade in asymptomatic individuals requires high analytical sensitivity. In our asymptomatic cohort, positive samples had a mean Ct value of 32 (Ct range of 40-15), where a Ct of 32 corresponds to a sample with a viral RNA load of approximately 1 \u00d7 10 5 copies per mL, consistent with reported values in similar populations 3 . Interestingly, although higher Ct values are associated with asymptomatic samples, compared to samples from symptomatic cohorts, these differences are neither consistent nor statistically significant 4 . Recent publications have proposed that saliva collection reflects peak infection, predicts COVID-19 outcome and is associated with lower overall cost 5-7 compared to nasopharyngeal collection. This project was facilitated by a bespoke IT application accessible via mobile phones, desktops or other computers. Test and sample data is linked to each AstraZeneca employee via their personal record identifier and a unique sample identity. The IT app ensures that the connection between this identity and sample is segregated and encrypted, while personally sensitive information is de-identified and high-fidelity sample tracking is facilitated.",
