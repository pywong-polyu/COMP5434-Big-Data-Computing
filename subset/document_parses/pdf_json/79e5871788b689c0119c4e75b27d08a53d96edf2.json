The principle of medical confidentiality protects patients' dignity and avoids potential harm if otherwise practised. Texts from the Quran and Sunnah substantiate that unjustified disclosure of secrets is prohibited and whoever breaches confidentiality is to be punished. This paper explores the origins of Islamic ethical framework vis-\u00e0-vis dealing with privacy, particularly confidential information acquired by health professionals. For that, this paper attempts to explore various \u0101y\u0101t (Quranic verses) and a\u1e25\u0101d\u012bth (Prophetic traditions) related to privacy, and thus to analogically deduct various aspects of confidentiality in the context of medical ethics. As a result, it aims to discourse on key principles of medical confidentiality from an Islamic juristic perspective, discussing its types and conditions.",

The Quran declares, \"no single thing have We neglected in Our decree\" (6: 38). Since the Shar\u012b\u02bfah offers deep care and concern for human emotions, it gives substantial importance for his privacy and its preservation from all forms of illegitimate intrusions (Ba\u1e25r, 1983, p. 35; Al-Najj\u0101r, 1990, p. 300) .

For example, Islamic medical ethics gives due attention to the four foundational principles in modern medical ethics: respect for autonomy, non-maleficence, beneficence, and justice (Beauchamp & Childress, 2001) . However, the Islamic bioethical perspective is largely grounded on the textual references, making it religious and ethical simultaneously. The merit in doing so is that if religious instructions are intertwined with ethics, then the confidence, sincerity, commitment, and decision-making of Islamic health professionals providing medical care will significantly impact recipients. However, it is essential to note that the beneficiaries of the Islamic ethical framework are not just Muslims alone; rather, it goes beyond religious boundaries. In other words, everyone can benefit from Islamic juristic principles, given that the recipients are convinced of Islam's universality and its orientation towards the benefit for all humanity. This aspect is pinpointed in Islamic ethics in general.",

His home is a private place where others do not interfere in his matters. Due to this intrinsic nature of home, the Quran puts strict rules for asking permission before entering somebody's home and when any member of the same family enters each other's room (Quran: 27, 28, 58; al-Qur\u1e6dub\u012b 1427 AH).

The main concern here is related to the prevention of the deliberate and unintended violation of privacy. As for medical confidentiality, it is meant to prevent unauthorized access to and unlawful disclosure of patient's information and protect patients from harm. In addition, this ruling shed light on the importance of seeking a patient's consent if any disclosure is needed for a better cause.

Allah prohibits violation of trust (al-Anf\u0101l: 27), and whoever breaches it is answerable before God. Exegetists comment that the trust mentioned in the verse includes secrets shared by a person. In addition, al-R\u0101z\u012b (1997) emphasizes that this verse implicitly prohibits to disclose people's defects. Underscoring the Quran, the Prophet said, \"Fulfil the trust of those who entrust you, and do not betray those who betray you\" (Ab\u016b D\u0101w\u016bd, 3: 289). Though trust embodies moral and material aspects, morality is given added significance, as it is difficult to duly compensate if violated. In Shar\u012b\u02bfah, fulfilling am\u0101nah (trust) such as keeping secret is obligatory while its disclosure is counted as khiy\u0101nah (betrayal), the opposite of am\u0101nah (al-\u1e6cabar\u012b, 1968 AH). Since confidentiality is built upon trust, its unjustified breach is hypocrisy, which is not expected from a professional practitioner. As far as medical confidentiality is concerned, it is a promise and trust given by the professional to the patient, which should not be broken without a higher and valid cause.",

The abovementioned three incidents imply various approaches to keeping privacy, which can appropriately be placed in situations related to medical confidentiality. Mainly, these incidents emphasize the importance of respecting privacy and not disclosing them, even the matter is insignificant or unharmful. It is primarily because people cannot completely understand the intentions and concerns of the confider, then the ideal approach is to keep the secret as it is. In addition, if there is a greater benefit for others without causing harm to the confider, the disclosure is also allowed as the third incident implies.

Remarkably, Islamic ethics and medical ethics share several common features, being harm elimination a central value in both. The frequent phrase articulated in discussions surrounding the validity in disclosure of confidential medical information is 'prevention of serious harm'. In other words, protecting patients or others from serious harm is generally deemed a justified warrant to breach confidentiality.
