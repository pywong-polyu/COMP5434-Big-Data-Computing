Methods We reviewed 218 intubated patients at Stony Brook University Hospital and stratified them into three groups based on AGI severity, according to data collected in the first 10 days of ICU course. We used chi-square test to compare categorical variables such as age and sex and two-sample t-test or Mann-Whitney U-tests for continuous variables, including important laboratory values. Cox proportional hazards regression models were utilized to determine whether AGI score was an independent predictor of survival, and multivariable analysis was performed to compare risk factors that were deemed significant in the univariable analysis. We performed Kaplan-Meier survival analysis based on the AGI score and the presence of FI. Results The overall incidence of AGI was 95% (45% AGI I/II, 50% AGI III/IV), and FI incidence was 63%. Patients with AGI III/IV were more likely to have prolonged mechanical ventilation (22 days vs 16 days, P-value <0.002) and higher mortality rate (58% vs 28%, P-value <0.001) compared to patients with AGI 0/I/II. This was confirmed with multivariable analysis which showed that AGI score III/IV was an independent predictor of higher mortality (AGI III/IV vs AGI 0/I/II hazard ratio (HR), 2.68; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.69-4.25; P-value <0.0001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that both AGI III/IV and FI (P-value <0.001) were associated with worse outcomes. Patients with AGI III/IV had higher daily and mean D-dimer and CRP levels compared to AGI 0/I/II (Pvalue <0.0001). Conclusions The prevalence of AGI and FI among critically ill COVID-19 patients was high. AGI grades III/IV were associated with higher risk for prolonged mechanical ventilation and mortality compared to AGI 0/I/II, while it also correlated with higher D-dimer and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. FI was independently associated with higher mortality. The development of high-grade AGI and FI during the first days of ICU stay can serve as prognostic tools to predict outcomes in critically ill COVID-19 patients.",

It has been shown that SARS-CoV-2 infects the target cells through the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptor, found on the surface of lung alveolar, endothelial, perivascular pericytes, cardiomyocytes, but also enterocytes. 10 , 11 Thus, direct viral injury to GI epithelial cells may contribute to AGI. Alternately, the pathogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 in the gastrointestinal tract could be attributed to the induction of a prothrombotic state and formation of microthrombi. 8 ,12 In our study, we investigated the link between the development of AGI and FI with mortality in COVID-19 intubated patients and its correlation with increased CRP and D-dimer levels as a manifestation of intense inflammatory state and possible intestinal micro-thrombosis, as well as the utility of these findings as prognostic tools.",

Our inclusion criteria required patients to be 18 years of age or older, intubated and on tube feeds for at least 24 h. Patients were excluded if there was no enteral tube intake documentation on record or if they expired or were extubated in less than 48 h after intubation, since such a brief period of observation did not allow for initiation of tube feeds or the collection of gastrointestinal function parameters. Thirty patients that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded from the study, yielding a cohort of 218 patients (Fig. 1) . We collected data on patient demographics (age, gender, body mass index (BMI)), duration of hospital stay, mechanical ventilatory support, and daily values of D-dimer and CRP as well as interleukin-6. We elected to monitor CRP as a surrogate of patients' inflammatory responses, since high levels have been linked to COVID-19 disease severity, 13 but also as a marker of possible bacterial superinfection. 14 Due to the susceptibility of critically ill intubated patients to blood stream and urinary tract infections as well as ventilator associated pneumonia, all the patients in our cohort were screened with blood, urine, and sputum cultures at time of intubation and as needed, depending on the clinical course.",

This was used as a prognostic factor based on previous evidence suggesting an association between D-dimer and increased mortality 15 but also to guide the choice of anticoagulation regimen. Specifically, in our institution, an aggressive anticoagulation protocol was implemented, which included dose escalation based on Ddimer levels. Patients with D-dimer < 1000 ng/mL received enoxaparin 40 mg daily, those with D-dimer \u2265 1000 ng/mL but < 3000 ng/mL received enoxaparin 40 mg twice a day, and those with D-dimer \u2265 3000 ng/mL received therapeutic anticoagulation with enoxaparin 1 mg/kg twice a day or intravenous heparin drip at a starting rate of 18 units/kg/h to achieve a goal PTT of 60 to 90. 16 Sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) scores were calculated for all patients at the time of intubation, which coincided with the ICU admission and has been used to quantify the degree of organ dysfunction or failure present on admission. 17 Specifically, for the cardiovascular component of SOFA, due to the variety and combination of pressors used in the ICU setting, we used the conversion as suggested by Lambden et al, 18 to allow for accurate calculations. First-line agents included vasopressin and norepinephrine with addition of phenylephrine and epinephrine as needed. We titrated the doses of vasopressors, following the guidelines of the \"Surviving Sepsis Campaign\" to maintain a mean arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg. 19 Almost the entirety of our cohort required vasopressor infusion even for a brief time at some point of the hospitalization.",

In our institution, the enteral feeds utilized were Nepro, Jevity, Glucerna, Pulmocare, and TwoCal depending on the patients' clinical characteristics and their nutritional needs. A single ICU nutrition protocol was in place to administer enteral tube feedings over 20 h. The prescribed formula was initiated at 30 mL/h and increased by 30 mL every 4 h as tolerated until the prescribed goal was reached. Gastric residual volume was documented every 4 h. If greater than 200 mL, the prescribed feeding was restarted at half the rate, and volume was rechecked in 4 h. If the residual was still greater than 200 mL, feedings were held for 4 h before restarting at 30 mL/h and increasing by 30 mL every 4 h, until goal reached, provided that the residual volume was not greater than 200 mL at any point. Knowing the caloric density of the different types of feeds, we calculated the daily caloric intake and compared it with the optimal volume and calorie goal as documented in the nutritionists' notes. Feeding intolerance (FI) was defined if 20 kcal/kg of body weight/day via enteral route could not be reached or if enteral feeding had to be stopped for whatever clinical reason. 4 We further gathered information on gastric residual volume, administration of total parenteral nutrition, use of prokinetics, and any relevant imaging, including abdominal x-rays and CT scans. Since our cohort consisted solely of ICU intubated patients, the documentation of self-reported GI symptoms was lacking. All patients were examined by the ICU team at least twice daily, during morning and evening rounds, with documentation of abdominal physical exam in terms of distention, frequency of bowel sounds, and quality of nasogastric tube or rectal tube output when present. To avoid interobserver variability due to the subjective nature and the dynamic evolution of the physical exam, we opted to use as quantifiable markers of gastrointestinal function, the measured daily stool count and volume, and the gastric residual volume. Based on this, we were able to identify whether our patients were having ileus, defined as the absence of bowel movements for three or more consecutive days without mechanical obstruction or diarrhea defined as three or more loose or liquid stools per day.",

AGI grade II was defined as gastrointestinal dysfunction (intubated patients with transient signs of shock and feeding intolerance that improved over the first 10 hospital days, normal gastric residuals with or without the presence of diarrhea or ileus). AGI grade III was defined as gastrointestinal failure (intubated patients with persistent signs of shock, feeding intolerance without improvement over the first 10 hospital days, high gastric residuals despite the addition of prokinetic agents, with or without the presence of diarrhea or ileus). AGI grade IV was defined as marked gastrointestinal failure with severe impact on distant organ function (intubated patient with persistent signs of shock, presence of feeding intolerance and diarrhea or ileus and clinically significant upper or lower GI bleeding, imaging-proved mesenteric ischemia, or Ogilvie's syndrome). 4 AGI score was implemented in several studies, and its utility was proven in identifying the severity of GI dysfunction and predicting adverse outcomes. 5 ",

Since reliable intra-abdominal pressure measurements require appropriate paralysis, we elected to not include intraabdominal pressure as a parameter to stratify patients in different AGI grades. Based on the above, we grouped our patients into three AGI categories: no AGI as group 0, AGI grades I and II (gastrointestinal dysfunction), and AGI grades III and IV (gastrointestinal failure). 21 We further subdivided our cohort based on whether patients developed FI or not.",

We utilized chi-square test to compare for any significant difference between two groups for categorical variables (sex, co-infections), twosample t-test for parametric (age, SOFA, BMI), and Mann-Whitney U-tests for non-parametric continuous variables (Ddimers, CRP, and interleukin-6 levels), which was determined based on normalness and skewness of these distribution. We investigated the evolvement of critical laboratory values such as D-dimer and CRP over days after intubation in correlation with AGI score. We collected and analyzed these laboratory values using MATLAB and time-locked to the intubation date. We assessed the survival of the subgroups using Kaplan-Meier models and a log-rank test. We had more than 5 months of follow-up for each patient without missing a data point in terms of survival. To determine whether the AGI score was an independent predictor of survival, we used Cox proportional hazards regression models. We determined significant factors to be involved in the multivariable Cox regression model based on the univariable analysis. These factors included AGI score, participation in the D-dimer-driven escalation of anticoagulation protocol, gender, age, and SOFA score. BMI greater than thirty-five and being on the steroid were not significant in the Cox model's univariable analysis. Entry level for multivariable analysis was P-value <0.1.

We found that a significant proportion of our patients developed FI during the first 10 ICU days. Similarly, Kaafarani et al. found a high prevalence of FI in their study, with 46% of the COVID-19 ICU patients having gastric feeding held for at least 24 h due to high gastric residuals. 8 FI in our study correlated with significantly higher mortality in the Kaplan-Meier analysis almost to the same extent as the presence of high-grade AGI.

However, those who developed AGI III/IV had higher mean D-dimer levels and higher D-dimer daily trends over 30 days than patients with AGI 0/I/II, which indirectly suggests they were in a relatively more hypercoagulable state. Our findings are consistent with Sun and colleagues' conclusions. They found that patients with AGI III/IV had significantly higher D-dimer levels than those with AGI grades II, I, and 0. 6 The pathogenetic mechanism behind the gastrointestinal dysfunction in critically ill COVID-19 patients is unknown so far. The two dominant theories suggest that this can be attributed either to direct viral injury to GI epithelia or the formation of microvasculature thrombi, 8 ,27 the latter of which is a finding well documented by autopsy studies in multiple organ systems. 12 Although the incidence of bowel ischemia necessitating emergent operative intervention was evident in the study by Kaafarani et al., 8 there were no patients in our study with clinical or imaging evidence of bowel ischemia. The absence of intestinal macrovascular thrombosis in our study could be partly explained by the implementation of aggressive anticoagulation in our hospital, driven by elevated Ddimers linked with improved outcomes. 6 ,28 However, since we have no autopsy studies, we cannot establish whether this aggressive protocol also prevented microvascular intestinal thrombosis, which is hypothesized to be the cause of acute gastrointestinal dysfunction in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Finally, our findings that the mean CRP levels and their daily trends were significantly higher in patients with AGI III/IV may reflect the cohort's greater inflammatory state due to impaired gastrointestinal function. However, this could be caused by a generalized inflammatory response to SARS-CoV-2, affecting multiple organ systems. Consequently, we can conclude that AGI grade may be a surrogate for the degree of inflammation in this patient population. Conversely, high CRP could predict the development of acute gastrointestinal failure. The high mortality that was observed in patients with AGI III/IV could be due to the more intense inflammatory response as reflected by higher CRP levels, which have been shown to correlate with disease mortality. 29 Up-trending D-dimer and CRP levels over the hospital course were considered prognostic factors of the poor outcome by our ICU teams as they reflected no improvement in the inflammation process 30 and indicated a higher risk for multiorgan failure prompting escalation of anticoagulation and consideration for limiting enteral nutrition, respectively.",
