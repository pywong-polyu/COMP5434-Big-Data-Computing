These finding suggests that patients with comorbidities had more severe symptoms, which clearly overlapped with the clinical symptoms of cardiovascular diseases. In the process of clinical practice, cautious screening is required to determine whether the symptoms are caused by COVID-19 or progression of underlying diseases. Particularly, chest tightness and fatigue might be associated with CVD including heart failure. Therefore, SARS-CoV-2 may induce and complicate the typical symptoms and manifestations of acute myocardial infarction and chronic heart failure.",

Regarding the possible mechanisms, prevalent CVD, as an inflammation disease, may serve as a marker of accelerated immunologic dysregulation and thus, aggravate the immunological imbalance induced by COVID-19. On the other hand, COVID-19 itself, might aggravate the myocardial injury, recent studies from Wuhan demonstrated severe COVID patients with the most ominous outcome had significantly higher TnI or TnT levels as compared to severe COVID-19 patients undergoing recovery17,18. It is known that SARS-CoV-2 can elicit the intense release of multiple cytokines and chemokines that can not only lead to vascular inflammation and plaque instability, but also to myocardial inflammation6, 12, which might be linked with the enhanced myocardial injury during the disease process. The interaction between preexisted CVD and the harm of SARS-CoV-2 on myocardial tissue might thus imply some of the mechanisms responsible for the worse outcome among mild COVID-19 patients hospitalized.",

Briefly, of all 394 patients in the medical record system, who were screened initially from February 5, 2020, to March 10, 2020, 43 patients without available medical information and duplicated records, and 19 patients who transferred to designated hospital because of non-COVID-19 clinical factors were excluded. Finally, the study population consisted of 332 patients hospitalized with confirmed COVID-19: 58 patients (17.5%) required referral because requirement for intensive care (intensive group) and 274 patients (82.5%) discharged (stable group). The median age was 51 years (median [IQR] age, IQR, 40-59 years), and 200 (61.2%) were female. Among these patients, fever (177 patients [63.2%]) was the most common symptom. Cough, fatigue, chest tightness, and myalgia were present in 108 patients (38.4%), 32 patients (11.5%), 39 patients (13.9%), , and 12 patients (4.3%), respectively. Diarrhea (11 patients [3.9%]), sore throat (4 patients [1.4%]), rhinorrhea (4 patients [1.4%]), headache (7 patients [2.5%]) , and toothache (2 patients [0.6%]) were rare.
