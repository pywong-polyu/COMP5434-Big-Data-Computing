Such vaccines rely on proven technologies such as recombinant protein-based vaccines to facilitate its transfer for emerging market vaccine manufacturers. Our group is developing a two-pronged approach to advance recombinant protein-based vaccines to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 and other coronavirus infections. One vaccine is based on a yeast-derived (Pichia pastoris) recombinant protein comprised of the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV formulated on alum and referred to as the CoV RBD219-N1 Vaccine. Potentially, this vaccine could be used as a heterologous vaccine against COVID-19. A second vaccine specific for COVID-19 is also being advanced using the corresponding RBD of SARS-CoV-2. The first antigen has already undergone current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) manufacture and is therefore \"shovel ready\" for advancing into clinical trials, following vialing and required Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) toxicology testing. Evidence for its potential efficacy to cross-protect against SARS-CoV-2 includes cross-neutralization and binding studies using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Evidence in support of its safety profile include our internal assessments in a mouse challenge model using a lethal mouse-adapted SARS strain, which shows that SARS-CoV RBD219-N1 (when adsorbed to aluminum hydroxide) does not elicit eosinophilic lung pathology. Together, these findings suggest that recombinant protein-based vaccines based on the RBD warrant further development to prevent SARS, COVID-19, or other coronaviruses of pandemic potential.",

Although the epidemic began in China, Europe, and the United States, there are significant concerns about the risks of disease emergence in low-and middle-income nations. There are now more almost 750,000 cases in Brazil, 300,000 cases in India, and 50,000 cases in South Africa, such that COVID-19 will become widespread among the poor living in the group of 20 nations [1, 2] . Moreover, SARS-CoV-2 infection is expected to emerge in the Global South [3] . In the African region of the World Health Organization (WHO), COVID-19 is now spreading in the populated areas of Ghana, Nigeria, and Democratic Republic of Congo, and presumably across the region [1] . In nations such as India, for example, the feasibility of enforcing social distancing in large and crowded urban centers will be particularly daunting [3] , so that ensuring access to a safe and affordable COVID-19 vaccine will become a global priority. Dr. Seth Berkley, the CEO of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, has highlighted the importance of prioritizing a COVID-19 vaccine specifically for these countries [4] .",

Our preliminary studies now show that the SARS-CoV-2 RBD candidate, which is specific for the sequence of the SARS-CoV-2, can also be highly produced in the yeast P. pastoris. Both approaches reinforce each other, as the processes developed for the CoV RBD219-N1 candidate also apply to the SARS-CoV-2 candidate, and both antigens downstream could be further developed as potentially a bivalent or a universal coronavirus vaccine.",

In 2004-2005, scientists at the Public Health Agency of Canada's National Microbiology Laboratory in Winnipeg, Manitoba (who helped to develop the first successful Ebola vaccine), found that a recombinant modified vaccinia Ankara (rMVA) expressing the S-spike protein resulted in severe liver pathology upon SARS-CoV virus challenge. Similarly, rMVA expressing the S-spike also resulted in lung immunopathology in rhesus macaques, as did other virus-vectored constructs. Lung immunopathology is also linked to whole inactivated viral vaccines. However, it was determined that in many cases eosinophilic pathology is driven by the SARS nucleocapsid (N) protein, although a recent trial in nonhuman primates found that an alum-adjuvanted inactivated SARS-CoV-2 vaccine did not induce immunopathology [13] . Among the major conclusions of these studies was that they may be driven by T helper-17 (Th17) responses linked to interleukin-6 [12, 14] , and that aluminum formulations exhibit greatly reduced immunopathology [15] .",

The rationale for selecting the RBD domain of the S protein includes focusing on the key component that binds to the human angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, and removing the known elements of the S protein involved in immune enhancement. Supporting studies summarized elsewhere emphasize how S protein peptides outside of the RBD can induce immune enhancement in non-human primates [12] . Moreover, CoV RBD219-N1 induce high titers of neutralizing antibodies in mice and 100% infection against SARS CoV virus challenge [10] . Alum formulations of CoV RBD 219-N1 do not induce immunopathology [10] , a finding consistent with other published studies [13] [14] [15] .",

In parallel, a CoV2 RBD protein candidate is being advanced. Regarding the former, against SARS CoV homologous virus challenge the vaccine formulated on alum exhibits high levels of protective immunity and with evidence of minimal or no immune enhancement [10] . With regards to cross-protection against SARS CoV2, the RBD of the SARS-CoV-2 and CoV RBD219-N1 share significant similarity of amino acid sequence (> 75% identity, >80% similarity) and there is evidence that both viruses use the human ACE2 receptor for cell entry [9] . Further published studies indicate strong antigenic similarities between the SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 RBDs, and the potential for cross protection. For example, serum from a convalescent SARS-CoV patient was shown to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 driven entry [16] . Moreover, new studies by Tai and colleagues find that using pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2, the SARS-CoV RBD blocks the entry of both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus into human ACE2-expressing 293T cells [17] . Through pseudovirus neutralization activity, it was found that SARS-CoV RBD-specific antisera could neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection, suggesting that SARS-CoV RBD-specific antibodies can cross-react with SARS-CoV-2 RBD and cross neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus infection [17] . Additional studies find that multiple (but not all) neutralizing monoclonal antibodies bind to both RBDs [9, 18, 19 ].",
