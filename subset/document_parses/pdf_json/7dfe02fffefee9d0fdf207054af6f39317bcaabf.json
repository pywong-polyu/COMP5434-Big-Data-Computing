Additionally, big companies like Huawei and Google are adapting their product philosophy to AAI and ML [2] [3] [4]. Using MLbased systems require always a training data set to achieve a usable, i.e. trained, AAI system. The quality of the training data set determines the quality of the predictions. One important quality factor is that the training data are unbiased. Bias may lead in the worst case to incorrect and unusable predictions. This paper investigates the most important types of bias, namely syntactic and semantic bias. Countermeasures and methods to detect these biases are provided to diminish the deficiencies.",

The bias is independent of the applied ML technique, i.e. probability theory or (inductive) logic programming.

Significance: Features (variables) of training samples that are not significant according to, e.g., the 5% level, can be dropped. Assume that the considered feature of the training sample is normally-distributed. Then, the f-and the t-test can be combined used to check the significance of the feature: Assume p is 5%, then the variable can be dropped, if the p-level of the t-test is less equal 0.05, and the f-test shows that the regressors coefficients are equal (to zero). The latter one investigates the joint significance of the features. 3. Dummy traps: This effect holds for regression, when the model suffers from (multi) collinearity.

Independent and identical distributed: This property for distributions of variables is important for the central limit theorem, stating that the probability distribution of the sum of independent and identical distributed variables (with finite variance) approximates the normal distribution. As a consequence, e.g., the significance of features can be investigated. An example for heteroscedasticity [15] . 5 . Heteroscedasticity: In this case the dispersion of sub-populations differs (see Fig. 2 ), and statistical hypothesis tests for their significance can become invalid. Heteroscedasticity can be detected by applying the f-test, which identifies how good a model fits to the training sample, since the f-test compares the variance of two subsamples. Especially for non-linear models may occur severe impacts, where models can become inconsistent. As an example consider the speed measurement of a moving object. The measurement close to the object is more precise than if the object has a greater distance. Thus, the measurement data are expected to contain heteroscedasticity, which is a general challenge of measurements [8] . Heteroscedasticity can be mitigated using various approaches. An overview of detecting heteroscedasticity and mitigating its effects is provided in [22] . The mitigation is based on an analysis and transformation of the residuals that cause the heteroscedasticity effect.",
