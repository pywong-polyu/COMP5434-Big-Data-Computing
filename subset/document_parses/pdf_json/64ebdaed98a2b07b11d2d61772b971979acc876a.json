We found that the ACE2 mRNA was highly expressed in the healthy human small intestine rather than the lung. Besides, single-cell RNA sequencing data showed that ACE2 was significantly elevated in the proximal and distal enterocytes, where the small intestinal epithelium is exposed to the foreign pathogen.

DPP4 is a known receptor for MERS-CoV through interacting with the S1 subunit of MERS-CoV spike protein. It has been reported that ACE2 controls intestinal inflammation and diarrhea. Therefore, mutual interaction between 2019-nCoV and ACE2 might disrupt the function of ACE2 and results in diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms. According to the data analysis of three recent reports, we compared the incidence of various symptoms from infected patients and found that the incidence of diarrhea significantly differed in different reports. As 2019-nCoV is highly homologous to that of SARS-CoV, and it has been reported that around 20-25% of SARS patients have diarrhea 14 , it is confusing to observe the relatively low incidence (2-3%) of diarrhea in two cohorts from hospitals in Wuhan. If the incidence of diarrhea is underestimated, the reasons may because it is sometimes challenging to diagnose diarrhea since we still do not have a precise criterion for it. The definition of diarrhea by the World Health Organization is having three or more loose or liquid stools per day or having more stools than a person's health condition. To a certain extent, this criterion is subjective. .
