            "text": "P atients' satisfaction with care service indicates that the health personnel finds it an incumbent upon themselves to make sure of patients' satisfaction. [1] Patients' satisfaction is a key factor of the quality of health cares and one of the predictors in measuring health outcomes and the quality of cares in a health center. [2] Patients' satisfaction is the outcome of a complicated set of factors and achieving it entails coordination in different aspects of services such as nursing, medicinal, and backup services. [3] The satisfaction level is defined as the difference between what is expected and what is realized. [4] Patients tend to accept a treatment program more easily when their satisfaction is at a desirable level. [5] In fact, the higher satisfaction in patients, the faster mental and physical recovery in them. On the other hand, dissatisfaction increases irritability and anxiety in patients, which prolongs recovery and hospitalization. Consequently, medication cost increases, and more beds remain occupied. [6] The patient's satisfaction level is measured based on several factors that are mostly reported by the patient. Based on satisfaction level, researchers can introduce new policies and plans and improve patients' satisfaction level and achieve better outcomes. [7] These factors cover all services by health personnel, including nurses and represent the attitude of patients about general appearance, cleanliness, peace, and waiting time. [2] Patients' satisfaction is affected by mental perception, patients' awareness of their rights, personnel's communicational abilities to establish a mental relationship with patients, and several other factors such as cultural, social, economic, and personality background. In addition, demographical factors such as age, gender, and education level can affect the satisfaction level. [8] Lee et al. in Canada showed that there is a significant relationship between age and education and satisfaction level in patients; so that satisfaction level in educated patients was less than that in patients with lower education level. [9] Studies have shown that nurses with higher professional commitment and communicational skills achieve a higher level of patient satisfaction. In addition, where nurses are given more independence, have a stronger role in decision-making, and cooperating with other health personnel, they achieve a higher level of patient satisfaction. [10, 11] Patient satisfaction measurement is a complicated and multifaceted phenomenon, including, among many, relationships with medical personnel, physical environment, and specification of health-care organization. [12] COVID-19 is a newly emerging viral respiratory disease with a rapid spread worldwide, which has affected the quality of nursing care. [13] The COVID-19 pandemic, also known as the coronavirus pandemic, was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, China. Now, it has spread all over the world. [14] It is a serious concern for health-care personnel including nurses. [15, 16] Studies have shown that the disease has affected nurses' mental and spiritual conditions in nurses which can have a negative effect on the quality of service. [17, 18] Objective Given that COVID-19 is an unknown and highly contagious disease and has inflicted a large number of individuals, it can affect nursing care, and the high bed-occupancy rate can cause a heavy financial pressure on the health-care system. During the COVID-19 pandemic, nurses are faced with a heavier workload. Taking into account the importance of nursing cares in terms of the patients' outcomes, having a deeper knowledge about patient's problems, and taking measure to improve their satisfaction and the paucity of studies on this field, the present study aimed to determine the patients' satisfaction and its related factors in patients with COVID-19. Our research questions were: 1. What is the patient's satisfaction level of patients with COVID-19 from nursing care? 2. What factors do affect the patient's satisfaction in patients with COVID-19?",

The first part was related to demographic information, including age, gender, marital status, education level, occupational status, Residential status, level of income, and smoking. The second part was Patient Satisfaction Instrument (PSI), which is a self-reported instrument. PSI evaluates the patients' attitudes toward nurses and nursing care. The instrument was developed by Hinshaw and Atwood (1982) , [20] consists of 25 items, with a 5-point Likert scale, including totally agree (Score 5), agree (Score 4), I am not sure (Score 3), disagree (Score 2), and totally disagree (Score 1) with a minimum score of 25 and a maximum score of 125. A score <78 indicates dissatisfaction, between 78 and 104 is the moderate satisfaction and more than 104 is complete satisfaction. The instrument is divided into three subscales: (a) Technical-professional care (7 items), (b) trust (11 items), and (c) patient education (7 items). [20] The first subscale includes items referring to technical skills, knowledge base, and carefulness. The items in the second subscale measure the patient-nurse relationship and the humanity of the nurse. The items related to patient education measure patient satisfaction with the nurses' teaching and supervision skills and their informativeness. In the technical-professional subscale, a score below 21 is dissatisfaction, between 21 and 28 is moderate satisfaction, and a score above 28 is complete satisfaction. In the subscale of trust, a score below 39 is dissatisfaction, between 39 and 52 is moderate satisfaction, and a score above 52 is complete satisfaction. Finally, in the patient education subscale, a score of <18 is dissatisfaction, between 18 and 24 is moderate satisfaction, and score of more than 24 is complete satisfaction. Sensitivity of PIS is 80% [21] and Jagoda et al. used Cronbach's alpha to confirm the reliability of the instrument (\u03b1 =0.88). [22] The validity of this instrument was determined by the content validity. For this purpose, the text of the questionnaire in Persian and English was provided to 10 faculty members of the School of Nursing and Midwifery of Urmia University of Medical Sciences. Then, their opinions were collected and their comments were given on the questionnaire. Moreover, the validity and reliability of the questionnaire had been confirmed by previous studies in Iran. [23] [24] Test and re-test method was used to confirm the reliability of the questionnaire and the correlation coefficient was 0.92.",

The interviewer was a nurse who works in the COVID-19 ward of Taleghani Hospital. The executive researcher visited the wards in different work shifts for recruiting the patients that met the inclusion criteria. In this stage, she used convenient purposive sampling to recruit the patients with COVID-19 who were hospitalized in Taleghani Hospital. Then, she invited them to participate in the study. If the patients with COVID-19 agreed to participate in the study, she explained to them the purpose, stages and duration of the study and answered their concerns and questions. She also assured them about their privacy and confidentiality of their information. Next the questionnaire was completed by one of the researchers. During data collection, the research team provided safety measures such as washing and disinfecting hands before and after visiting each patient, wearing an N95 mask, gloves, gown, hat, and shoe cover. Sampling took 2 months, and the third researcher collected the data of 196 patients with COVID-19 [ Figure 1 ].",

In addition, age, gender, education level, marital status, and income were not significantly related to patients' satisfaction, but the residential status was not significantly associated with patients' satisfaction, [25] which this finding is against our result. Karaca and Durna in Turkey showed that most patients were highly satisfied with the services provided by nurses. Furthermore, married patients with high education levels, patients with good hygiene conditions, and patients who had been hospitalized more than once were more satisfied with nursing services. [26] Owaidh et al. in Saudi Arabia showed that most patients had a high satisfaction concerning health-care services. In addition, male patients and those with higher education levels were more satisfied. [2] Patients' satisfaction in different countries can vary due to various factors, such as available facilities. Moreover, the health system's attention to the factors that might create dissatisfaction in patients and attempts to solve them is a crucial feature of the developed countries' health system. Among the problems that might negatively affect the quality of services is the low nurse/patient ratio and heavy workload on patients. [27] Notably, these findings might be rooted in low expectations of patients with health-care services. Consistent with our findings, Kol et al. indicated that the majority of patients were moderately satisfied with nursing care. They reported no significant relationship between gender, education level, and marital status, and patients' satisfaction. [28] Lee et al. in Canada showed that most participants were desirably satisfied with services provided, [9] which is consistent with our findings. Dzomeku et al. in Zambia indicated that the patients' satisfaction with nursing care was at a low level, [29] which does not confirm our results.",

[38] One of the limitations of this study was the presence of environmental, behavioral, and psychosocial factors that can influence the patients' satisfaction, and the researcher has no control over them. A single measurement method that involved a self-report questionnaire as the sole measurement method was another limitation of this study. The study was conducted in a single public hospital in Iran. Therefore, the results cannot be generalized to all hospitals. Future studies should include more than one hospital in both the private and public sectors, and the nursing care provided in private and public hospitals should be compared. Moreover, the study population consisted only of hospitalized patients. Further studies are required to assess satisfaction with nursing care in COVID-19 outpatients.",
