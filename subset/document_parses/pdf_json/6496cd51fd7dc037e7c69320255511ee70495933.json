Previous research suggests that BTO dielectric constant increases as nanoparticle diameter decreases. This report recounts an investigation of this relationship. Injection-molded nanocomposites of 5 vol% BTO nanoparticles incorporated in a low-density polyethylene matrix were fabricated and measured. Finite-element analysis was used to model nanocomposites of all BTO sizes and the results were compared with experimental data. Both indicated a negligible relationship between BTO diameter and dielectric constant at 5 vol%. However, a path for fabricating and testing composites of 30 vol% and higher is presented here.",

            "text": "A material's ability to store electrical energy at a particular voltage is dictated by its dielectric constant (\u03f5), which defines the material's permittivity relative to the permittivity of vacuum. The increasing demand for energy storage has driven research into superior dielectrics, referred to as colossal dielectric constant (CDC) materials. [1, 2] These materials have dielectric constants above 1000, which is much higher than that of conventional dielectrics, such as plexiglass, mica, and air. [3] The most common mechanisms that can give rise to these large values of the dielectric constant are ferroelectricity, charge-density wave formation, hopping charge transport, and various kinds of interface effects. [2] The ferroelectric perovskite compound BaTiO 3 (BTO) is a CDC material. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S1 , the structure of BTO consists of a central titanium atom that is slightly offset from the unit cell midplane (when below the Curie temperature), resulting in a relatively high dielectric constant at room temperature. [4] [5] [6] BTO has a generally accepted dielectric constant between 1500 and 2000 for particle diameters of 1 \u03bcm. [7] Multiple studies have demonstrated the dependence of the dielectric constant of BTO on particle diameter, and BTO nanoparticles with diameters lower than 500 nm have exhibited dielectric constants as high as 4000. [8] In one study, the dielectric constants of BTO nanoparticles synthesized in a vacuum environment were investigated. [9] Across a particle diameter range of 10-500 nm, a dramatic increase in dielectric constant to over 15,000 was reported for BTO with a diameter of \u223c70 nm. [9] A similar peak in dielectric constant was found for BTO nanoparticles produced in air. [10] Promising results have been reported, but BTO nanoparticle dielectric constants have varied significantly between different studies. Therefore, a complete understanding of the relationship between BTO nanoparticle diameter and dielectric constant is still needed. Here, we present an initial investigation into this relationship through the fabrication, measurement, and computational modeling of polymer-matrix nanocomposites containing BTO nanoparticles.",

The experimental stage of this study involved the fabrication of BTO nanocomposites using a novel injection molding technique. The capacitance of the specimens was then measured, and the dielectric constant of the nanocomposite, \u03f5 composite was calculated. The nanocomposite specimens used for analysis consisted of BTO nanoparticles (with diameters ranging from 50 to 500 nm) incorporated into a matrix of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) at 5 volume percent loading (vol%). 5 vol% loading was selected for this study to ensure nanocomposites could be created using this novel fabrication method, before introducing higher concentrations of BTO which could complicate the process. Further research will involve the analysis of nanocomposites at even higher volume percent loadings (30+ vol%). In the modeling stage of this study, COMSOL Multiphysics finite-element analysis (FEA) was used to determine a theoretical model of the composite dielectric constant. This was then compared to the experimentally determined \u03f5 composite to extract the dielectric constant of BTO for each particle size.",

            "text": "Nanocomposites were produced using the process illustrated in Fig. 1(b) . The nanocomposite fabrication process involves a mixing stage and a molding stage. In the mixing stage, agglomerated BTO was ball milled with zirconia grinding balls (0.5 mm diameter, Retsch 32.368.0003) and surfactant (tert-Butylphosphonic acid, or tBuPA) for 4 h at 150 rpm. The ball mill (Retsch PM100) disperses agglomerated nanoparticles, which enables the BTO to be evenly dispersed within the LDPE matrix. [14] BTO nanoparticles were functionalized with tBuPA, obtained from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO), to prevent nanoparticle re-agglomeration after ball milling. The amount of tBuPA used in each specimen is inversely proportional to the diameter of the BTO nanoparticles being incorporated into the polymer. The 500 nm BTO specimens require the smallest amount of surfactant, while the 50 nm specimens require the highest level of surfactant. For an initial mass of 25 g of BTO nanoparticles used to fabricate three 5 vol% specimens, the 500 nm BTO samples required 0.225 g of tBuPA, and the 50 nm BTO samples required 2.249 g of tBuPA. The complete calculation of the surfactant required for each diameter is included in section S3 of the Supplementary Material. After ball milling, a steel filter (Finum Part 63/421.08.00) was used to separate the grinding balls from the tBuPA-coated BTO nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were then mixed with LDPE powder in a closed container to obtain a homogeneous dry mixture consisting of 5 vol% BTO. This mixture was transferred to a Pyrex container, which was then placed in a vacuum oven. A nanocomposite sheet was produced by melting the LDPE in the mixture at \u2212101 kPa at a temperature of 215\u00b0C for 2 h. The melted sheet was removed from the oven and cooled to room temperature. The sheet was cut into nanocomposite pellets with an area of \u223c1 cm 2 that was used for injection molding with the Morgan Industries Plastic Injection Molding Machine (Model G-100T). [16] A schematic of the custom-built 6061 aluminum single-specimen mold used for injection molding nanocomposite specimens is shown in Supplementary Fig. S7 . Disc-shaped specimens with diameters and thicknesses of 40 and 1 mm, respectively, were fabricated using a barrel and nozzle temperature of 500\u00b0C. After the injection molding process, a gold film with a 100 nm thickness was sputtered onto each side of the nanocomposite specimens using a sputter coater (Quorum Technologies Q150T). For each BTO nanoparticle size (50, 100, 200, 300, 400, and 500 nm), six 5 vol% specimens were produced. A total of 36 nanocomposites were investigated. For a complete description of the nanocomposite manufacturing process with notes on the design of the mold, refer to section S4 of the Supplementary Material.",

The values of \u03f5 m shown in Supplementary Table S3 for the 50 and 500 nm specimens were used in a quadratic interpolation to estimate the \u03f5 m values for the 5 vol% nanocomposites across all particle diameters. Figure 2(b) shows the lack of dependence between particle size and composite dielectric constant once the surfactant's contribution is separated.",

            "text": "Following the analysis of the surfactant's influence on the relationship between particle size and composite dielectric constant, a sweep on BTO dielectric constant was performed by varying \u03f5 p from 0 to 4000. Because the simulated particle size of BTO was 500 nm, \u03f5 m = 5.58 was used in the model, which corresponds to the dielectric constant of LDPE loaded with the lowest amount of surfactant (Supplementary  Table S3 ). Figure 4(a) shows that an \u03f5 p range of 2000-2500 closely overlaps the experimentally measured \u03f5 c for 5 vol% 500 nm BTO specimens presented in Supplementary  Table S3 . Based on the data extracted from the model [ Fig. 4  (a) ], it was concluded that the BTO dielectric constant has a low impact on the composite dielectric constant at 5 vol% loading. Between the \u03f5 p range of 1000 and 4000 , \u03f5 c varies by less than 0.2. This phenomenon is a result of BTO comprising a small volume per cent of the nanocomposite. Therefore, the relative magnitude of error in determining BTO dielectric constant at 5 vol% (both experimentally and computationally) motivates the investigation of significantly higher volume loadings of BTO. This will allow for conclusive observation of meaningful dielectric changes as a result of particle diameter. Indeed, Kaufman et al. demonstrated that higher volume loadings allow for decreased error in determining particle dielectric constant. [17] Figure 4(c) shows the effect of BTO dielectric constant on the dielectric constant of the nanocomposites. Future research will focus on fabricating, measuring, and simulating BTO nanocomposites with loadings of 30 vol% and greater. This effort was halted prematurely by the circumstances caused by COVID-19, but a complete procedure for fabricating 30 vol% BTO samples by incorporating a step of LDPE dissolution in xylenes is described in the Supplementary Material. Samples produced by incorporating this step will enable future research into the relationships between BTO nanoparticle diameter and dielectric constant, which could potentially be revealed at higher volume loading.",

Moreover, Supplementary Table S3 highlights a dependence of the dielectric constant on the concentration of tBuPA in the specimens. Figure 2 (b) presents an analysis of the effect surfactant has on the medium dielectric constant and verifies that there is only a weak relationship between composite dielectric constant and BTO nanoparticle size at this 5 vol% BTO loading. When separating the contribution of the surfactant in the value of \u03f5 m , it is evident that \u03f5 m and particle size are not inversely related. However, this figure does highlight how higher levels of tBuPA increase the value of \u03f5 m and result in the extraction of higher \u03f5 c from fabricated nanocomposites. As a result, the small shift in the dielectric constant values of the nanocomposites at different particle sizes can be explained by the influence of the surfactant. Figure 4 (b) further shows how the extraction of the dielectric constant of the BTO particles at 5 vol% loading is limited by the error presented at a low volume loading.",

This indicates that the simulated results showing no clear relationship between BTO diameter and nanocomposite dielectric constant at 5 vol% loading are a reasonable approximation of experimental data, as with higher levels of agglomeration and known medium and BTO dielectric constants, the experimental results can be closely approximated by the model. The FEA results shown in Fig. 4(a) and the dielectric constants determined from 500 nm BTO nanocomposites (Supplementary Table S1) indicate that the degree of agglomeration of BTO nanoparticles in LDPE is close to F a = 0.7. Further studies into the agglomeration state of the fabricated specimens, investigated using TEM, will provide valuable insight into the physical state of BTO agglomeration in fabricated nanocomposites.

The FEA simulation produces \u03f5 c values that align with experimental results within a range of values of 2000-2500 for \u03f5 p , but the use of the Jayasundere-Smith EMA produces a range of 1100-1350 values of \u03f5 p . This inconsistency highlights the limitations of using a low volume loading of BTO to implement the use of the Jayasundere-Smith EMA for the extraction of \u03f5 p . However, the data do suggest that agglomeration is playing a role in the dielectric constants of our composites, even at modest volume loadings. Further investigation into the agglomeration state of the specimens is necessary to compare the FEA simulation with different EMA results. Future studies will focus on investigating the agglomeration state of specimens with volume loadings ranging from 5 to 50 vol% using TEM to develop an EMA that closely replicates the system.",

[17] After investigating 5 vol% loaded specimens produced with the fabrication methods outlined in this study, the next step involved revising the procedures to reach higher volume per cent loaded samples. Comparing computational models of 5 and 30 vol% loaded samples [ Fig. 4(c) ] demonstrates how the behavior of the curve shifts the plateau region of \u03f5 p to higher values. This helps minimize the error presented in the current experimental results by allowing a broader range of values to approximate the BTO nanoparticle dielectric constant. As the relative magnitude of error decreases, other influencing factors, such as the contribution of surfactant, become easier to quantify. Presently, each measured average dielectric constant value falls within the error bounds of most other data points [ Fig. 2(a) ], meaning the dielectric constant contribution from the surfactant cannot be reliably extracted. With the fabrication of higher vol% loaded nanocomposites, and more control samples containing only surfactant, these effects can be accounted for. BTO nanocomposites with higher volume loadings can be fabricated through an additional LDPE dissolution step using xylenes in the mixing stage shown in Fig. 1(b) . Using this, polymer dissolution step has enabled the fabrication of 30 vol% loaded specimens (see Supplementary Material) . Future studies will investigate the relationship between BTO diameter and dielectric constant using this modified fabrication method.",

COMSOL simulations agree with the experimental results, though adjustments to the fundamental assumptions of the models may yield more interesting insights in the future. The results presented here provide further insight into the properties of BTO nanoparticles that have been indicated in previous studies. This study necessitates further investigations of LDPE-BTO nanocomposites at higher volume loadings, which could indeed reveal a clear relationship between BTO nanoparticle size and dielectric constants. Such a study might facilitate the discovery of a drastic increase in the dielectric constant of BTO at a critical nanoparticle size, which could have significant implications in energy storage and conversion applications. injection molding procedure.
