All five monoclonal antibodies exhibited high neutralizing titers to SVV. The epitopes targeted by these mAbs were further identified by peptide scanning using GST fusion peptides. The peptide 153 QELNEE 158 is defined as the smallest linear neutralizing epitope. The antibodies showed no reactivity to VP2 single mutants E157A.

In the early stage of infection, the virus colonizes the tonsils and begins to replicate and multiply in large quantities, and then enters the bloodstream to cause viremia, which passes through the blood circulation and enters the main organs [2, 3] . And in the early stage of the disease, the sick pigs showed anorexia, lameness, fever, and snooze; then the skin or mucous membranes such as the nose, tongue, and hooves formed white swelling, followed by ulceration [3] [4] [5] . The first strain of Seneca Valley virus (SVV-001) was isolated in 2002 [6] . It was used to treat certain neuroendocrine tumors, such as non-small cell lung cancer [7] . Therefore, it has always been considered a non-pathogenic virus. Since 2015, a large number of SVV infections has been observed in piglets in Brazil [8] , the United States [9] , and China [10, 11] . The veterinary diagnostic laboratory at Iowa State University in the United States has sequenced the whole gene and found that the homology of all newly Open Access *Correspondence: lixiangmin@mail.hzau.edu.cn \u2020 Wei Wen and Xinghua Chen have contributed equally to this work 1 State Key Laboratory of Agricultural Microbiology, Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan 430070, Hubei Province, People's Republic of China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article isolated strains is as high as 99%-100%.

The P1 polypeptide is cleaved by 3C protease into VP0, VP3, and VP1, which constitute the viral nucleocapsid, and the mature VP0 is cleaved to form VP2 and VP4 [1] . VP1, VP2, and VP3 proteins are distributed on the outer surface of the capsid, while VP4 protein is on the inner surface of the capsid [1, 15] . Previous studies have shown that VP1, VP2, and VP3 proteins can induce the production of neutralizing antibodies.

Pig are often co-infected with SVV and other vesicular viruses [19] , and the clinical symptoms between SVV and other vesicular viruses are difficult to distinguish [1, 8] .

Dvorak used a modified prokaryotic expression vector pET-24b to express and then purified VP1, VP2, and VP3 proteins and coated the three recombinant proteins with ELISA plates, respectively [18] . Through the verification of a large number of clinical samples, it was found that the sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA plate coated with the VP2 protein alone were better than that of the ELISA plate coated with the VP1 and VP3 proteins. And Goolia used cELISA, VNT, and IFAT to continuously detect antibodies in SVV-infected pig serum [17] . The diagnostic specificity and sensitivity for cELISA were 98.2% and 96.9%, and for VNT were 99.6% and 98.2%. When comparing based on the Kappa coefficient, there is a strong agreement between cELISA, VNT, and IFAT. Virus ultra-highspeed centrifugation is an effective method to obtain high concentration and high purity antigen. In 2017, Mike Strauss used the ultra-ionization purification method and obtained high purity virus particles through a cesium chloride gradient. Three structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3 can be seen by SDS-PAGE detection. To develop specific tools to assist SVV detection, we prepared high-purity SVV virus particles and generated 5 monoclonal antibodies against neutralizing epitopes. These five antibodies all recognize the linear epitopes 153 QELNEE 158 of VP2 protein, which is conserved among SVV. We also construct the recombinant virus and further demonstrate that E157 is the pivotal point for 6D7-mAb to neutralize SVV. After a comprehensive analysis of the experimental results of Goolia and Dvorak, we speculate that VP2 is likely to be the major immunogenic protein.",
