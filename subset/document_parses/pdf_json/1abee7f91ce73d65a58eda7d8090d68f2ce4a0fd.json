This research aimed to assess the perceptions of pharmacists on involvement in the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine administration in four Balkan countries (Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Serbia). A cross-sectional survey was conducted using an online questionnaire that was distributed to community pharmacists across these countries between February and March 2021. A total of 636 community pharmacists were included in the analysis of the survey. The willingness to administer vaccines for COVID-19 (or other vaccines well established in the practice, like a flu vaccine) in community pharmacies is significantly different among the countries: the pharmacists from Albania were more willing to administer vaccines. The factors associated with the eagerness to vaccinate are almost the same among the countries: the lack of training in the faculty classes and the lack of a special place where to administer vaccines. Additional significant factors were found in Bulgaria (pharmacists from independent pharmacies wanted more than the pharmacists working in chain pharmacies to administer vaccines) and in Serbia (male pharmacists agreed more with administering vaccines than female pharmacists). Further national reforms are needed for adopting the expanding role of community pharmacists.",

They have received greater authority from several governments all around the world to aid overcrowded hospitals (4) . Various global studies underlined the importance of community pharmacist role expansion and engagement in vaccination services (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) , leading to a more valuable and premature public health response that is potentially obtained during a pandemic if community pharmacists expanded their roles and engaged in vaccination services (6, 10) .",

Community pharmacies may offer a low and convenient cost for vaccination, being already prepared for vaccination logistics with multiple strategies for injection/vaccine supply chain management (14) (15) (16) (17) . They are often conveniently located and do not usually require appointments for vaccination services. This can increase access to vaccines that are medically suggested (18) . Pharmacists are also able to combat misinformation, clearly communicate, and assess patient understanding (19) , therefore decreasing vaccine hesitancy through persistent education (4) as human skepticism, and hesitancy regarding this unique health intervention deters immunization campaigns (20) .",

Nevertheless, in other countries such as Jordan, pharmacists are not the ones who vaccinate, they can only prescribe over-the-counter medications. Despite an urgent need to extend the prescribing role during the COVID-19 pandemic, the opportunity for pharmacists to extend their prescribing authority has not emerged yet (8, 9, 38) . On the contrary, community pharmacists in Italy got the legislative approval to administer vaccines such as AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson after completing an obligatory training course and only in pharmacies with a specific infrastructure containing areas of reception, administration, and saving patient's data (39) . Until the COVID-19 pandemic burst, vaccines were administered in pharmacies in Italy by nursing Q1: \"Do you agree that pharmacy students must be trained to administer vaccines in a community pharmacy and administering vaccines should be part of the curricula taught to pharmacy students?\"; Q2: \"Do you agree that pharmacists could administer vaccines (in general) in a community pharmacy\". Q3: \"Do you agree that pharmacists could administer well-established vaccines (safe, with rare adverse drugs reactions, as, for example, the flu vaccine) in a community pharmacy?\" Q4: \"Do you agree that pharmacists could administer new vaccines (as Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine) in a community pharmacy?\" Q5: \"Do you agree that pharmacists would provide the vaccination service for free because, after all, they have benefited from the sales?\" Q6: \"Do you think the vaccination service provided by the pharmacists should be paid?\" Q7: \"Who should pay for the vaccination service provided in pharmacies?\" Q8: \"Do you think the community pharmacy where you work could arrange a special space for administration of the vaccines by pharmacists.\" Our survey focused upon the pharmacist's perceptions regarding the barriers that pharmacists believe must be overcome for the administration of vaccines and the benefits that would be offered through vaccination services provided in the community pharmacies from the European countries included in our study. More than 67, 68, and 98% of the pharmacists from Romania, Albania, and Bulgaria, who were included in the analysis, offered different thoughts or solutions about the implementation of vaccination services in community pharmacies. Although some of the participants are eager to evolve professionally and need to be seen as a credible healthcare human resource, others are reluctant toward administering vaccines. The lack of training and the lack of a special space for this activity are the most important barriers, similar to other studies (40) (41) (42) . Therefore, assessing various practices and vaccine delivery possibilities as part of multifaceted pharmaceutical care remains challenging (34, 43, 44) .",

            "text": "A Romanian pharmacist considers that vaccination services provided within community pharmacies could \"increase the trust of general population in pharmaceutical services, could determine patients to seek more often the professional advice of a pharmacist, and could consequently, gain patients\" support for this profession, further leading to legislative changes in its approval. The pharmacists from Albania recall the importance and involvement of pharmacists as first-line professional medical personnel not only during pandemic times but all the time as \"the patient is always directed to the pharmacy first and it would be meaningful to administer the vaccine there.\" Another Romanian pharmacist concludes that \"the only advantage, especially in the pandemic situation, would be the large-scale immunization of the population\" as a mitigation strategy. Most of the Romanian surveyed pharmacists believe that \"the legislation on the compartmentalization of the pharmacy must be changed, including a vaccination space\" and one pharmacist suggests that \"at least a few pharmacies in each city could represent a compromising beginning\" in facilitating vaccination services within community pharmacies. Bulgarian pharmacists also think \"it would be good for a patient to be able to get vaccines, without being mandatory for all pharmacies, \" but after ensuring proper training and education for pharmacists within faculties of pharmacy. Some of the pharmacists proposed to attend special courses for both vaccination and first aid in case of the appearance of vaccine side effects. Pharmacists might be in an impossible position to provide a fast and adequate first aid in case of an adverse reaction, including an anaphylactic shock, while administrating a vaccine, as a pharmacist from Bulgaria confirms. This could imply, as a Romanian pharmacist points out, a \"stronger psychological barrier of the patient\" and could lower even more their trust toward pharmacist's activity. Another study that included European pharmacist's opinions mentions their lack of training and knowledge of providing clinical procedures and lack of recognition of their expertise as barriers in their pharmaceutical care (39) . Pharmacist's roles and preparedness have never been more attractive to take into consideration as part of the interdisciplinary care until now (42, 43) . Paudyal et al. (39) also reported the need of some European pharmacists for training regarding the effective use of protective equipment. For example, in Croatia, a novel course about pharmaceutical vaccination services (\"Flu-vaccination in Pharmacy Practice\") was introduced in 2021 in the obligatory curriculum of the Faculty of Pharmacy (39). Jacob et al. (44) stated that in the USA, according to a national survey prior to the use of COVID-19 vaccines, most pharmacists would receive (78%) and recommend (81%) a COVID-19 vaccine. In Portugal, every 5 years, pharmacists are obliged to participate in training regarding vaccine delivery (34) . The curriculum of the master program at the University of Belgrade-Faculty Pharmacy is adapted to the new and pharmacy services to be implemented and therefore several courses cover the vaccination services. The guidelines for flu vaccination in community pharmacies are prepared by the Pharmaceutical Chamber of Serbia, and the legislative approval is waiting (32) . Furthermore, the pharmacists from Bulgaria draw attention to their inability to track all diseases and conditions of patients imposing additional risks for both pharmacists and patients. Some pharmacists from Albania, Romania, and Serbia proposed the idea of \"an online platform that could contain the medical history of each patient, \" and all health professionals could have access to this platform. Paudyal et al. confirmed the lack of access for pharmacists to patient's clinical records (39) . This could also lead to improving the relationship between pharmacists and physicians. Even more, a proper monitorization of a person's health by all health professionals could also reduce risks for pharmacists, as a pharmacist from Bulgaria mentioned: \"Vaccination should be tailored to the person's health. Pharmacists do not have access to complete patient information and cannot judge whether a person's vaccination is appropriate for them. Many factors, such as chronic and autoimmune diseases, need to be considered. In addition, pharmacists do not have information on whether the patient has viral diseases such as AIDS and hepatitis, which poses a risk to the health of the pharmacist himself.\" A participant from Albania proposed a collaboration between pharmacists and physicians during vaccination, which could ensure medical advice given to community pharmacists when needed but did not expand the answer with possibilities of idea implementation. Collaboration with healthcare professionals is very important as some Romanian and Bulgarian pharmacists consider that pharmacists should not be confounded with physicians since they have not received vaccination training during faculties. In addition, some of them suggest that vaccination services provided among community pharmacies could increase patient's trust in pharmacist's activity and could meliorate the opinion of the general population about the status of the pharmacists. Dawoud et al. also described the pressure of pharmacists who constantly aim to gain patient's trust (43) . One pharmacist even mentioned that a possible \"conflict of interests\" could appear but did not expand the response. One of the most submitted advantages of providing vaccination services among community pharmacies is represented by a \"partial relief in physician's tasks\" and consequently \"lowering the burden of family doctors, \" ensuring time economy for patients and medical staff, consequently with other research studies (42, 46) . One of the specialists from Bulgaria believes that administering a vaccine with the help of the pharmacists could ensure \"better distribution of people, lack of long queues in front of hospitals, less risk of infection and transmission of the disease, greater choice of the patient where to get the vaccine.\" Paudyal et al. conducted a qualitative study among the pharmacists from 16 European countries to identify possible novel actions for pharmacists to provide clinical service during pandemic times and therefore to ensure the recognition of pharmacists as public healthcare providers (39) . A pharmacist from Romania also noted that vaccination within community pharmacies could lead to larger vaccine accessibility of patients who would be provided prompt medical services \"leading to an improvement in the quality of human life.\" The pharmacists from all Balkan countries included in our study agree upon the general mentality of the population and the difficulty of the pharmacist's reposition as first-line health professionals, underlining the need to strengthen the relationship between pharmacists and patients. A generalized tendency of individuals to have superior trust in the doctor's advice has been noted by some pharmacists from different European countries included in the present analysis, consistent with other studies (43, 46, 47) . Even more, several other studies confirmed the difficulty of patients to accept the advice provided by a pharmacist (39, 42, 43, 47) .",

Another Romanian pharmacist complains about \"minimum staffing schemes\" and underlines their necessity to fulfill \"activities anyway far beyond the job description, \" while a Bulgarian colleague believes that the possible advantages from vaccination services within community pharmacies \"would be only for the doctors if another of their obligations was dropped.\" Even more, a great number of Bulgarian pharmacists think that increasing community pharmacist's task will determine an \"influx of people in the pharmacies and providing vaccines for them will complicate\" even more \"their other duties.\"",

European pharmacists have already been involved in disease control and prevention of infection in the past year and directly ensured healthcare directed toward patients as a response to the pandemic crisis (39, 42, 43, 46) . In Croatia, pharmacists have also been involved in the production of hand sanitizers and online counseling using telemedicine devices (32) . To prevent the spread of SARS-COV-2, pharmacists communicated with patients and provided proper explanations about the importance of social distancing and the correct use of protective equipment (39, 41, 43, 48) . Most pharmacists from Albania claim the need for higher organizational preparedness, after the lack of educational vaccination programs, consistent with other studies (34, 50) . Their colleagues from Bulgaria draw attention to the possibility of increased workload for pharmacists while relieving physician's burden. Moreover, the pharmacists from Romania address legislative barriers with a more commonly mentioned reluctance in comparison to their neighbors. A systematic review conducted by Burson et al. revealed that despite a higher rate of vaccine service acceptance from both pharmacists and patients, legislative and administrative barriers limit the effectiveness of vaccine administration within community pharmacies (50) . Even though it did not represent the main focus of their study, Austin et al. underline that all the pharmacists agreed upon the regression of clinical services such as pharmacovigilance or vaccinations during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in Canada, possibly due to overloaded work and social distancing recommendations (1). Prescription checkups, management of cleaning protocols, educating patients, and combating fake news due to their communication skills, as well as monitoring medication inventories emphasize multitasking behavior of community pharmacists (1, 39) . This behavior has been described, however, as dramatically stressful and can disrupt pharmacy practice (1, 51) . Adjustments in the schedule of community pharmacies (32) , increasing the number of human resources (43) , and prioritizing pharmacovigilance services through interdisciplinary teamwork (41, 43, 50) could minimize fatigue and distress in personnel (39, 43) .",

Though many countries have implemented such programs as well as appropriate legislative requirements, still there are issues and barriers to the entire usage of pharmacist's knowledge, capacity, and capability in some South-East countries such as Albania, Bulgaria, Romania, and Serbia. Some types of resistance from pharmacists themselves to adopt these new roles to provide such services were demonstrated in Bulgaria, Romania, and Serbia, but not in Albania. The main limitation to the development of the pharmacist's role in vaccination was identified as being the limited access to training opportunities. Our study provides a piece of evidence to influence the pharmacy curricula revision and change. Vaccination training should be integrated into pharmacy education because it could enhance professional opportunities and could increase the recognition of community pharmacists as reliable and trustworthy healthcare professionals.",
