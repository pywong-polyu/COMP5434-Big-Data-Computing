Several questionnaires with these characteristics exist today. From its conception, the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-3L) was created as a generic and standardized questionnaire, which is simple to answer. It also includes a visual analogue scale (VAS) where the respondent rates his or her own general health on a scale ranging from 0 (worst imaginable health) to 100 (best imaginable health); this is known as the EQ-VAS value and directly reflects the HRQOL as rated by the respondents. This instrument is widely used throughout the world and is available in more than 170 languages [4] . It is feasible to assess the HROoL of the population, given that it is easy to use and intended to provide valid and reliable information [5] . The EuroQol Group perceived a growing interest in assessing HRQOL in younger people, which was a suitable measure for children and adolescents, creating the EQ-5D-Y instrument. This was developed on behalf of the EuroQol Group in the year 2009/2010 by a team of researchers from 7 countries (Germany, Italy, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Holland, and United Kingdom) [6] . This version for children and young people is the most internationally used HRQOL's questionnaire among children and adolescents [7] .",

The EQ-5D-Y utility index for the total sample was 0.890. This score was significantly significant (p = 0.027) for males (0.899) than for females (0.881). The ceiling effect was higher for men (47.3%) than for women (40.7%). However, the ceiling effect experienced a reduction as the age of adolescent students increased with the exception of 17 years old. In addition, statistically significant differences were detected in the EQ-5D-Y utility index between ages, as well as between weight groups established according to BMI. We can observe in Table 2 that the EQ-5D-Y utility index of the sample segmented by sex, according to age and BMI category. When analysing the results by age groups, it can be seen that 13-year-old adolescents reported the highest mean utility at 0.931. However, the lowest group included 12-year-old males with a mean of 0.886. The 12-year-old females showed a mean of 0.908, being the highest; and the 15 year old group showed a mean of 0.842, being the lowest in the female age group. It can also be observed that the highest ceiling effect is found at the age of 12 years in both sexes: female 69 among females (68.3) and 60 among males (60.6).",

As for obesity, we observe 83 females versus 29 males who present obesity. There is a total of two underweight males and two underweight females. It can also be observed that there is a statistically significant difference in sex for each weight category in the EQ-5D-Y utility index. In Table 3 , we can observe similar gender difference for each dimension. In the mobility dimension, 95.7% of the males and 94.9% of the females responded \"I have no problem walking\". In the self-care dimension, 95.1% of men and 92% of women responded \"I have no problems washing or dressing myself\". In the usual activities dimension, 78.1% of the men and 73.8% of the women responded \"I have no problem performing my usual activities\".

Finally, in the anxiety/depression dimension, 52.70% of the men and 44.1% of the women responded \"I am neither anxious nor depressed\".

This finding is consistent with previous studies used with the EQ-5D-Y. For example, 81.2% of Korean respondents reported the highest health status (11111) [30] . Likewise, in the study on the EQ-5D-Y health states in the general population in Sweden, 63.4% of respondents reported a full health status [25] . In another study on children and adolescents with asthma, the results showed that 48.9% of the respondents reported this same health status [25] . A study by [31] indicates that this may be due to the ceiling effect, because EQ-5D-Y may not be able to distinguish when the participant's health is close to full health.",

Our data agree with the Demographic and Family Health Survey (ENDES) of the National Institute of Statistics and Informatics (INEI), which indicated that 58% of Peruvians over 15 years of age suffer from overweight and obesity. Similarly, in the study by Lozano-Rojas [32] , where the same ages were taken as in our study, they indicated a high prevalence of overweightness. Therefore, approximately one out of every two or three schoolchildren in the studied population present obesity or overweightness. The results found are almost similar to the prevalence of obesity and overweightness in adolescents aged 12 to 19 years in Ecuador [33] .",

It is also observed that, as age increases, there seems to be worse HRQOL, which may be due to the physical and psychological changes that occur at this stage. As for the psychometric properties, the questionnaire presents certain problems of high ceiling effect. In order for girls to improve their health-related quality of life data, it may be of interest to include educational programmes that raise awareness of the specific issues for girls that lead to higher levels of anxiety and depression. These programmes should not only target students but also parents, family members, and the wider educational community. It would be in the interest of the political authorities to adopt concrete policies and laws to enable girls to improve their health-related quality of life. ",
