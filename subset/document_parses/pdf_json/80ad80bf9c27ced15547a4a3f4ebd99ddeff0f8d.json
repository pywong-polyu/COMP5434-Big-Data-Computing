This study aimed to evaluate the factors influencing anti-factor Xa activity in COVID-19 patients receiving low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). We prospectively evaluated 80 COVID-19 patients, diagnosed using polymerase chain reaction test, who were admitted to our clinic and administered LMWH; LMWH (enoxaparin) was applied according to the weight, D-dimer levels, and clinical condition of patients. Anti-factor Xa activity in blood, drawn 4 h after the 3rd dose of LMWH, was measured and an activity of < 0.2 IU/mL was considered subprophylactic. Patients were followed up clinically, and anti-factor Xa activity was re-examined before discharge. Groups 1 and 2 included 13 and 67 patients with subprophylactic (mean \u00b1 SD: 0.18 \u00b1 0.06) and prophylactic (mean \u00b1 SD: 0.43 \u00b1 0.23) anti-factor Xa activity, respectively. The proportion of eosinophils in patients was significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2 (mean \u00b1 SD; 2.96 \u00b1 2.55 vs 0.90 \u00b1 1.28; p = 0.001). At the time of discharge, the eosinophilic proportion of patients was significantly higher (eosinophil %, mean \u00b1 SD; 3.06 \u00b1 1.49 vs 2.07 \u00b1 1.92; p = 0.001), but the activated partial thromboplastin time was significantly lower (22.34 \u00b1 1.38 vs 24.38 \u00b1 3.58; p = 0.01) in group 1 than in group 2. Of 14 patients with eosinophil content > 4%, 6 were in group 1 ((6/13) 46.2%), while 8 were in group 2 ((8/63) 11.9%); (p = 0.009), and all had a D-dimer level < 1 \u03bcg/mL (p = 0.03). ROC analysis for the presence of anticoagulation at subprophylactic level revealed an area under curve of 0.79 (95% CI: 0.64-0.93); p = 0.001). In conclusion; Elevated eosinophil count is related to lower anti-factor Xa activity in patients with COVID-19 receiving LMWH. The clinical significance of the subprophylactic anti-factor Xa activity should be studied in COVID-19 patients (NCT04507282).",

Anticoagulant therapy reduces mortality and morbidity in COVID-19 patients [19, 20] . Various suggestions have been made about the application of anticoagulant treatment strategy. Various laboratory parameters (D-dimer) and clinical conditions of patients are effective in determining these recommendations [22] . Previous studies examined the anti-factor Xa activity after LMWH administration for VTE prophylaxis, and values below 0.2 IU/mL have been shown to be subprophylactic doses [17, 18] . However, the efficacy and dose of LMWH administered in COVID-19 patients is not clear. It is apparent that levels below the anti-factor Xa values determined in previous studies may increase the risk of VTE in COVID-19 patients, which can cause hypercoagulability.

These results suggest that eosinophils had more effect on antifactor Xa activity of LMWH in COVID-19 patients. However, these two patient groups had no similar characteristics. The dose of LMWH used is not standard, so that the result should confirm with large clinical trial. The patients who had thoracic CT lesions, more advanced disease, and were older males exhibited higher inflammatory parameters. This has been shown in previous studies [27] .",
