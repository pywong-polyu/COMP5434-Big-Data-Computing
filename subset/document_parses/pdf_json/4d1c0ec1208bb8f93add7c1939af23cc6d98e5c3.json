Meetings are conducted via electronic platforms to avoid congregation. Staff are encouraged to practice social distancing. Imaging equipment status is tracked daily to ensure adequate imaging capacity. I n p r e s s 2. Monitor and respond to rapid changes in the COVID-19 pandemic. Our existing radiology management structure was too large and cumbersome to effectively respond to the rapid scenario changes. We constituted a smaller radiology disease outbreak task force, incorporating faculty with experience in intense operations (eg, colleagues who have held senior positions in the armed forces). This task force meets daily (eg, 20 minutes each morning) to assess overnight incidents and anticipated changes during the day.Radiology has inserted itself into our infectious disease clinical team due to the key role of imaging in timely diagnosis as well as infection control (nosocomial infection related to imaging tests). The radiology task force actively disseminates information to all staff members via electronic means (eg, website, emails, text messaging).3. Long range planning for COVID-19: a new norm for radiology operations. At seven weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak, we have minimized in-hospital transmission. Due to the global spread of COVID-19, we are looking at new norms of practice. Our goal is to inculcate an ongoing culture of infection control practice embraced by all staff members. We are rethinking how radiology can deliver optimal imaging and treatment while reducing unnecessary movement and congregation of patients within our hospital environment. Teleconsultation and electronic smart appointment applications and counselling are being fast tracked for implementation and will have far reaching impact on our future practice. If a patient presents with fever or cough and meets the criteria above: 1) Ask the patient to put on a surgical mask and place the patient as quickly as possible into an Airborne Infection Isolation (negative pressure) room in the ED or at least a private exam room. Keep the door closed.",
