We report here the strategy implemented to optimize the design of our peptide mimic, its high helical folding propensity in water and its ability to block cells infection by SARS-CoV-2 with an IC50 in the nM range upon binding to spike RBD with strong affinity.

These interactions occur mainly through the N-terminal a-helix H1 of hACE2 ( Figure 1A) . This a-helix, composed of 27 residues (from S19 to L45, Figure 1C ) contains 12 residues (highlighted in red in Figure 1B ) involved in hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. 12 Our strategy was to design a peptide with high helical folding propensity and retaining most of the binding affinity of hACE2 to spike RBD of SARS-CoV-2, using natural amino acids 13 . Indeed, we preferred not using complex chemical tools known to stabilize a-helix 14,15 in order to limit developability constraints. To design our mimics, we set up an optimization process with the dual aim of optimizing the helical content and limiting the antigenicity, to avoid triggering a neutralizing immune response that would compromise the peptide therapeutic potential. A combination of the Agadir program, 16 an algorithm developed to predict the helical content of peptides, and the semi-empirical method reported by Kolaskar 17, 18 to highlight the number of antigenic determinants (AD), was iteratively used.",

Overall, an excellent agreement was observed between the AGADIR-computed values and the experimental helical population inferred from CD data.

            "text": "Of course, even for peptides, the development of a drug at a pandemic speed requires some considerations. Our aim was to design a peptide with reasonable helical folding propensity in water in order to mimic the H1 helix of hACE2 in the protein context, considering this helical folding as a prerequisite to compete with hACE2 upon interaction with viral spike protein. The design was realized using only natural amino acids 38 and avoiding complex tools known and validated to stabilize a-helix. 39, 40 Stabilizing a-helical structure of medium size peptide sequences (up to 15 residues) using only natural amino acids is a hard but achievable task. 41 Our choice was guided by the desire to build a simple peptide easy to produce quickly on a large scale, without technical constraints requiring sometimes laborious development. We also assumed that the use of mostly natural amino acids can facilitate the essential stages of the development of therapeutic tools in the event of success, particularly around pharmacokinetics, pre-clinical and clinical toxicity aspects. This seems to us to be a fair compromise between designing a-helix peptide with optimized binding affinity and developing an effective tool within short deadlines by integrating the constraints of developability.",

These peptides demonstrated to have a high helical content (up to 80% for P6). However, increasing this helical content to maximum level led to increasing mean hydrophobicity and hydrophobic moment (see Table S4 ) that proved to be detrimental to solubility and efficacy. The substitution of a leucine residue by the homoTyrosine residue led to peptide analogue P7 with a slight increase in solubility and a weak efficiency to block SARS-CoV-2 cell infection (IC50=7 \u00b5M). In this first generation of peptides, the 27 residue P8 peptide appeared to be highly soluble with high helical folding propensity (70%), and an ability to block SARS-CoV-2 cell infection at 10 \u00b5M with an IC50 of 800 nM on VeroE6 cells.",

These peptides proved to be highly efficient in blocking SARSCoV-2 cell infection (100% efficacy at 1 \u00b5M) on VeroE6 cells together on pulmonary cells with IC50 in the nM ranges. This blocking property is related to their ability to bind to SARSCoV-2 spike RBD with affinity estimated in the sub-nanomolar range (Tables 1 and S6) . Finally, these peptides proved to be devoid of cell toxicity at 150 times the IC50 concentration (Figures 3E and F and SI) highlighting their therapeutic potential.",

These preliminary assays helped us to identify two peptide mimics that stand out (P7 and P8) for their ability to block the viral infection, highlighting a potential role of homotyrosine (Y). This observation helped us in the peptide mimics structure optimization process. Two new peptides were designed, P9 and P10 incorporating the hTyr residue and evaluated with P8 for their ability to block viral infection on VeroE6 cells through the measurement of infectious virus production and viral genome. 26 In order to get insight on their ability to block viral infection on human pulmonary cells, Calu3 cell line (ATCC HTB55) was chosen.

Targeting prophylaxis first might shorten the drug development time scale. Formulated as a sublingual tablet or oral spray, these peptides might be aimed at blocking the infectivity of the virus in a preventive manner. Their biodistribution would be limited to the upper airways (oral cavity ...) and it would be degraded in the digestive tracks without any toxic residues.Funding and AcknowledgementsThis work was supported by private funds (PK), SATT-Lutech, Kaybiotix (LGM PhD grant), French Research Ministry (EO PhD grant).

After 1 h adsorption at 37\u00b0C, 3 mL of infectious media (DMEM supplemented with 2% FBS, P/S and miconazole) were added. Twenty-four hours post-infection another 2 mL of infectious media were added. Five days post-infection, supernatants were collected, aliquoted and stored at -80\u00b0C (P1). For secondary virus stock, Vero-E6 cells seeded into 25 cm 2 tissue culture flasks were infected with 0.5 mL of P1 stored aliquot, and cell-culture supernatant were collected 48 h post-infection, and stored at -80\u00b0C (P2).Infectious viral particles were measured by a standard plaque assay previously described with fixation of cells 72 hr post infection, as described(Mendoza et al, 2020).",

To date, clinically approved vaccines or specific drugs addressing SARS-CoV-2 targets are lacking. 30 Among all possible viral targets, the virus spike protein/hACE2 interaction has been validated and the design of compounds able to block this interaction upon binding to spike protein is a promising approach. However, developing a specific drug at a pandemic speed is a hard task and this specific drug cannot be a small molecule. Indeed, beyond the time required for the identification and validation of a lead compound after a library screening, followed by structure-activity relationship studies and clinical development, small molecule drugs are associated with a high attrition rate partly due to their offtarget toxicity observed during pharmacological studies.",

Small-scale crudes (<30 mg) were purified using semipreparative Ace column (Ace 5, C18, 250 mm \u00d7 10 mm i.d., 5 \u03bcm, 300 \u00c5) at a flow rate of 5 mL/min. Purification gradients were chosen to get a ramp of approximately 1% solution B per minute in the interest area, and UV detection was done at 220 and 280 nm. Peptide fractions from purification were analyzed by LC\u2212MS (method A or B depending of retention time) or by analytical HPLC on a Dionex system consisting of an automated LC system (Ultimate 3000) equipped with an autosampler, a pump block composed of two ternary gradient pumps, and a dual wavelength detector, piloted by Chromeleon software. All LC\u2212MS or HPLC analyses were performed on C18 columns. The pure fractions were gathered according to their purity and then freeze-dried using an Alpha 2/4 freeze-dryer from Bioblock Scientific to get the expected peptide as a white powder. Final peptide purity (>95%) of the corresponding pooled fractions was checked by LC\u2212MS using method A. Two methods were conducted for LC\u2212MS analysis. Method A. Analytical HPLC was conducted on a X-Select CSH C18 XP column (30 mm \u00d7 4.6 mm i.d., 2.5 \u03bcm), eluting with 0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (solvent B), using the following elution gradient: 0\u22123.2 min, 0\u221250% B; 3.2\u22124 min, 100% B. Flow rate was 1.8 mL/min at 40 \u00b0C. The mass spectra (MS) were recorded on a Waters ZQ mass spectrometer using electrospray positive ionization [ES+ to give (MH)+ molecular ions] or electrospray negative ionization [ES\u2212 to give (MH)\u2212 molecular ions] modes. The cone voltage was 20 V. Method B.
