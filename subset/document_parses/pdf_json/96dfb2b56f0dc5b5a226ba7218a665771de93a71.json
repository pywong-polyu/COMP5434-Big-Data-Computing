The biological relevance of RNA structure-mediated mechanisms involved in internal ribosome recruitment is now emerging from the structural and functional analysis of viral IRES elements. However, because IRES elements found in genetically distant mRNAs seem to be organized in different RNA structures, the definition of the structural requirements for IRES activity is challenging and demands multidisciplinary approaches. This review discusses the latest reports that establish a relationship between RNA structure and IRES function in picornavirus genomes, the first RNAs described to contain these specialized regulatory elements.",

            "text": "Internal initiation of protein synthesis in picornavirus Picornaviruses belong to an important group of animal pathogens that have evolved a specialized mechanism to promote translation initiation of their mRNAs internally [1] . This mechanism of translation initiation enables the preferential translation of their genome while avoiding the modification of translation initiation factors (eIFs) and other host factors that occur in infected cells [2] [3] [4] and induce the inactivation of host protein synthesis. The process of internal initiation of translation in eukaryotic mRNAs is dependent on a cisacting element known as the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) that uses an internal codon in the mRNA to start protein synthesis. IRES elements were originally found in the genomes of picornaviruses, which are a family of positive strand RNA viruses [5, 6] . IRES elements have also been found in a growing number of genetically distant viral RNAs, including flaviviruses, retroviruses, coronaviruses, dicistroviruses and plant RNA viruses, in addition to several cellular mRNAs that are translated under conditions when cap-dependent initiation is inhibited [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] .",

The process of protein synthesis is initiated by the interaction of the 40S ribosomal subunit (bound to eIF3-eIF2-methionyl-tRNA) with the eIF4F complex (eIF4G-eIF4A-eIF4E), which in turn is bound to the 5 0 cap of the mRNA. This macromolecular complex then scans the 5 0 untranslated region (UTR) to reach an AUG triplet in an appropriate context [16] . By contrast, IRES-dependent translation initiation recruits the translational machinery to an internal position in the mRNA, regardless of the presence of upstream AUG codons, stable RNA structure and protein-binding sites [1, 17] .",

In picornavirus RNAs the poly(A) tail together with the sequence of the 3 0 UTR, which is specific for each genus, constitute essential determinants of the virus multiplication cycle [32] [33] [34] . The efficiency of viral RNA replication is enhanced by protein bridges that mediate RNA circularization by interacting with both ends of the viral RNA. In poliovirus RNAs the cloverleaf (CL) structure and the adjacent C-rich spacer interact with the host protein PCBP2 and the viral protein 3CD [35] generating a ternary complex that is essential for viral RNA replication, and that possibly regulates the switch from translation to replication [36] .

In agreement with data reported in other RNA viruses [40] , the 3 0 end of the FMDV genome establishes strand-specific long range RNA-RNA interactions, but in this case there are two different interactions, one with the IRES element and another with the S region at the 5 0 end [41] (Figure 1 ). Different RNA motifs seem to be involved in these interactions because a high-order structure adopted by the entire IRES and the 3 0 UTR was essential for RNA interaction, whereas the S region interacted with each of the stem-loops at the genome 3 0 end. The 3D structure of the FMDV 3 0 UTR is unknown; however in enteroviruses the 3 0 UTR is organized as two stem-loops that adopt a quasi globular organization [42] .",

This region of domain 3 contains two conserved purine-rich motifs, GNRA and RAAA (N, any nucleotide, R, purine), located in distal loops that do not tolerate nucleotide substitutions, deletions or insertions [55, 56] . The proximal region of this domain is organized as a base-paired structure interrupted with bulges that includes several noncanonical base pairings and a helical structure at its proximal region that is crucial for IRES activity [57] . These results suggest that the central domain could have a regulatory role during internal initiation, in which the proximal region of the central domain contributes to IRES activity by serving as a platform that holds the apical region in a conformation appropriate for its recognition by the translation machinery.",

GNRA tetraloops are often involved in RNA folding, generating RNA tertiary contacts [61] . Sequence variability of the IRES region in FMDV field isolates shows substitutions in the GUAA sequence yielding GCAA or GCGA, always compatible with the GNRA consensus motif. Conversely, as shown by RNA probing, IRES residues involved in base pairing often show nucleotide covariation (Figure 2 ), strongly supporting the need for preserving IRES structure for internal initiation [54] . Site-directed nucleotide substitutions disrupting the FMDV GNRA motif led to the reorganization of the apical region of the central domain, demonstrating the significant role of this conserved motif in dictating the stability of the cruciform structure. Subsequent structural probing of GNRA mutants enabled the identification of a distant region (motif A) that became more susceptible to RNase attack [51] . Functional analysis of mutants in this region indicated a reduction in IRES activity similar to that reported for GUAG mutants. Conversely, RNA probing of the second-site substitutions showed that motif A mutants contained a reorganization that affected the mutated region and also the distant GNRA motif [62] . Based on the reciprocity of RNA structural changes this short region behaves as a receptor of the GNRA motif. Lack of genetic variability in this region in approximately one hundred FMDV sequences [63] showed a strong selective pressure for keeping the primary sequence. This feature can be explained either because of its involvement in distant contacts with other RNA motifs, or by recognition by auxiliary factors involved in translation initiation that remain to be identified.",

Along this line, RNA probing of the entire CVB3 5 0 NTR has shown that the previously known domains II to VII, defined by mutational and bioinformatic approaches, comprises a long-range tertiary interaction involving bases in domain II and domain V [60] that connects the 5 0 end (domain I, which folds in a CL structure) with the IRES element.

In the aphthovirus genome, two in-frame AUG triplets separated by 84 nucleotides are used as translation initiator codons of the viral polyprotein. The second functional triplet (AUG2) is used to initiate protein synthesis more frequently (80%) than AUG1 in infected cells, and also in cells transfected with chimeric RNAs [67, 68] . A conserved A-rich sequence precedes AUG2 ( Figure 2 ) and is engaged in base pair formation within a stem-loop phylogenetically conserved in FMDV field isolates. By contrast, the first functional start codon (AUG1) is located in a single-stranded region, as judged by its accessibility to chemicals and enzymes [66] . Initiation of protein synthesis from both AUGs is IRESdependent but the mechanism operating in codon selection remains poorly understood. It has been proposed that following entry of the ribosome the initiation complex scans along this viral region until AUG2 is reached [68] , or that the initiation complex is transferred to the vicinity of AUG2 [67] . Recently it was shown that translation initiation at AUG2 was barely abrogated by the presence of a modified, more stable RNA structure in the spacer sequence [66] , consistent with previous observations of lack of effect of antisense molecules bound to AUG1 [67] .

Recent studies have taken advantage of reagents permeable to the cellular membrane that recognize RNA molecules in a structure-dependent manner to elucidate the organization of picornavirus IRES elements in living cells [52] . Notably, specific bases of the central domain in the FMDV IRES were differentially reactive towards dimethyl sulfate (DMS) in vivo than in vitro (Figure 2) , demonstrating that the pattern of modification found in the cytoplasm of living cells differed from that obtained in vitro. In addition, new DMS-reactive bases specifically detected in vivo affected nucleotides involved in the formation of G:C base pairs in the secondary structure model generated in vitro. This result again suggests that the central region of the IRES adopts a different local RNA conformation in the cellular cytoplasm. Decreased attack of residues in the C-rich loop in vivo suggested a potential RNA-protein interaction; this conserved motif is a candidate for interaction with PCBP [27] . Conversely, strong protection in the region upstream of the initiator codon suggested the formation of RNA-protein complexes, which overlap the region described to interact with translation initiation factors in tissue culture cells [24, 71] .",

The modification of RNA accessibility detected in the central domain in vivo could be because of different scenarios. The interaction with host transacting factors in the cellular cytoplasm could be responsible for this reorganization, as observed in vitro for other IRES elements [72] . Another possibility is the acquisition of a structural conformation that might facilitate a direct involvement of the apical region of the central domain with the ribosomal components. In support of this hypothesis, a tRNA-like structural motif that serves as substrate for RNase P in vitro resides in this IRES region [73] . These two possibilities are not mutually exclusive, and both need further investigation because no 48S initiation complexes have been detected in the absence of eIFs and the corresponding IRES-dependent toe-prints are located downstream of the respective initiation codon [66] ( Figure 2 ).",

Although the primary sequence is remarkably divergent, conservation of specific motifs in IRES structural organization could provide some hints on their evolutionary history. As an example, the conservation of the pseudoknot motif -a characteristic feature of the HCV IRES -supports the possibility that the differences in RNA structure found among picornavirus IRES might have come about by horizontal transmission between different ancestors [50] . Another conserved feature of viral IRES is the presence of one or more polypyrimidine tracts [1, 48] . However, a search of IRES elements on the basis of short conserved primary sequences (e.g. the polypyrimidine tract or the Crich motifs that provide PTB or PCBP-binding sites, respectively) does not guarantee the presence of a functional element. The data available are theoretically compatible with a high-order structure generated by a combination of several structural elements that differ between divergent IRES elements; how many different combinations can generate a functionally active element remains an unresolved question.",

First, the differences in the relative position within the IRES and also within the genome of other distantly related viral RNAs [74, 77] could be the remnants of an ancestor module without function in the viral genome. Second, because overlapping information in the small genome of RNA viruses occurs often, it is also possible that this motif is involved in a new function still to be determined.

            "text": "In this regard, structural studies performed on HCV and the IGR of dicistroviridae members have shown that these IRES elements are located in the interface of the ribosomal subunits [79, 70, 44] . These results suggested that specialized motifs of the IRES region mimic the initiator tRNA (tRNA i ) during initiation of protein synthesis and have recently been confirmed in domain 3 of the CrPV IGR [80] . It is proposed that the IGR structure undergoes subtle structural changes during the process of translation initiation, suggesting a direct involvement of the RNA structure in the ribosome assembly and translocation process. It can be envisaged that a tRNA-like motif within the picornavirus IRES could contribute to efficient recognition of the viral RNA by the translational machinery because it seems to occur in the dicistrovirus IGR [14, 80] . However, to date there is no evidence of the formation of binary complexes mediated by the picornavirus IRES and 40S subunits in the absence of eIFs. Thus, a functional connection between RNA organization detected by structural analysis and a putative tRNA-like structure detected by ribozyme recognition in IRES elements requires further investigation.",

            "text": "Concluding remarks and future perspectives Understanding how RNA structure-mediated mechanisms operate in genetically divergent IRES elements is necessary for generating a model of the internal initiation process occurring in eukaryotic cells. Picornavirus IRES elements seem to work as a ribonucleoprotein engine that assembles a large number of factors into a specialized, appropriately folded RNA structure that can be recognized by the ribosomal subunits. Other viral IRES elements seem to work as docking RNA structures that can gain access to specific sites in the ribosomal subunit without the help of additional factors. In between these divergent types of IRES elements, large variations in the mode of action exist that extend from picornavirus-like to the poorly understood cellular IRES elements. The idea that a universal IRES motif could consist of a structural element that mediates the interaction with the ribosomal machinery has gained support from studies using different approaches. In particular, structural and functional studies of the relatively small dicistrovirus IRES models have led to the idea that the IRES element itself mimics the initiator tRNA during internal initiation, in a process in which flexibility of the RNA molecule is crucial. Evaluating this model in the more complex, but also more efficient, picornavirus IRES elements represents a major challenge for the near future.",

On 4 March 1880, Jacobus George Robbers founded the modern Elsevier company intending, just like the original Elzevir family, to reproduce fine editions of literary classics for the edification of others who shared his passion, other 'Elzevirians'. Robbers co-opted the Elzevir family printer's mark, stamping the new Elsevier products with a classic symbol of the symbiotic relationship between publisher and scholar. Elsevier has since become a leader in the dissemination of scientific, technical and medical (STM) information, building a reputation for excellence in publishing, new product innovation and commitment to its STM communities.",
