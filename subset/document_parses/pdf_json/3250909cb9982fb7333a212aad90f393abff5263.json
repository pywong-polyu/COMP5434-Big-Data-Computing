Methods Patients diagnosed with pneumomediastinum after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy for their CTD-ILD were enrolled. The baseline characteristics of patients who developed pneumomediastinum after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy (n=13, all occurring within 120 days) were compared to those of patients who did not develop pneumomediastinum (n=49). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors associated with pneumomediastinum. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was also performed to assess the predictive performance. Results The body mass index (BMI) [odds ratio (OR) (95% confidence interval (CI)) 0.482 (0.272-0.853)] and serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) [OR (95% CI) 1.013 (1-1.025)] levels at baseline were identified as independent factors associated with pneumomediastinum after corticosteroid initiation. The optimal cut-off points of the BMI and LDH levels for predicting pneumomediastinum development, as estimated by the Youden index, were 20.2 kg/m 2 and 378 U/L, respectively. LDH showed a sensitivity of 61.5% and the highest specificity of 87.8%. Importantly, combining these markers resulted in the highest sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 71.4%. Conclusion A low BMI and high serum LDH levels at baseline are useful predictive factors for pneumomediastinum development in CTD-ILD patients.",

Although less frequent than in DM/PM, pneumomediastinum in other connective tissue disease (CTD)-related ILD (CTD-ILD), such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (10, 11) , systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (12) and systemic sclerosis (SSc) (13) , has been described in a few case reports. Controversy exists as to whether or not the development of pneumomediastinum itself in these comorbid cases is a prognostic factor. In a recent retrospective cohort study of 25 CTDpneumomediastinum patients, occurrence was associated with a low cumulative survival rate (1 year: 52%, 2 years: 40%) (5); in contrast, Yoshida et al. (7) investigated the prognosis of pneumomediastinum in DM and reported that the direct cause of death was actually respiratory failure resulting from progressive ILD or infection. They thus concluded that pneumomediastinum itself is never a poor prognostic factor in DM.",

In fact, the onset of pneumomediastinum in CTD coincides almost directly with corticosteroid therapy, especially after initiation or increasing dosages. Zhang et al. (15) reported 28 patients with CTD complicated by pneumomediastinum, of whom 26 (93%) developed it after steroid therapy. Similarly, among DM patients with pneumomediastinum, the onset was observed during corticosteroid therapy in the majority of cases (19/21; 90%) (7) . However, to our knowledge, no published studies have focused on patients after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy for CTD-ILD and investigated the clinical manifestations according to the development of pneumomediastinum.",

These results indicated that both the BMI and LDH level were effective for predicting the development of pneumomediastinum, as the area under the curve (AUC) for BMI was 0.711 (95% CI 0.541-0.881), while that for LDH was 0.709 (95% CI 0.516-0.901).

The sensitivities of the BMI alone and LDH level alone were 53.9% and 61.5%, respectively, and their specificities were 83.7% and 87.8%, respectively.

In this study, the BMI and serum LDH levels at baseline were identified as independent factors as- sociated with pneumomediastinum after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy. The optimal cut-off point estimates of the BMI and LDH levels for predicting the development of pneumomediastinum were 20.2 kg/m 2 and 378 U/L, respectively. LDH provided a sensitivity of 61.5% and the highest specificity at 87.8%. Importantly, combining the two markers by adding the LDH level to the BMI resulted in the highest sensitivity of 100%, although its specificity was 71.4%. This indicated that the combination of a low BMI and/or high LDH levels at baseline was useful for predicting pneumomediastinum after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy. Three important findings were obtained from this study. First, a low BMI and high LDH level at baseline were significant predictors for pneumomediastinum after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy for CTD-ILD, whereas CADM was not. These results enable the risk stratification and early detection of pneumomediastinum patients requiring management of CTD-ILD. Both the BMI and LDH level are clinically utilizable markers, but neither has been reported as a pneumomediastinum risk factor in the field of rheumatology. Because of the rarity of CTD patients presenting with comorbid pneumomediastinum, there are only a few statistically established risk factors, and well-known clinical char-acteristics of pneumomediastinum in CTD are mainly based on published case reports. Within the literature, only two studies have reported statistically significant predictors of pneumomediastinum. In one study, cutaneous ulcers were found to be an independent risk factor for the development of pneumomediastinum in DM (9), while a systematic metaanalysis found that high anti-MDA5 antibody levels had an increased OR for pneumomediastinum among DM patients (31) .",

            "text": "Second, we provided insight into the association between a low BMI and/or high LDH levels at baseline and the development of pneumomediastinum. A low BMI indicates starvation or malnutrition, leading to atrophic changes in connective tissue within the alveoli. This is evidenced by animal studies in which caloric restriction caused a significant decrease in lung tissue elasticity (32), alveolar wall thinning and alveolar loss (33) . Indeed, in a clinical setting, the relationship between a low BMI and the risk of pneumomediastinum has been well established (34, 35) , especially in anorexia nervosa patients (even excluding vomiting), suggesting that pneumomediastinum may constitute a complication of an underweight status (36) . However, the BMI values and severity of patients in our study were not comparable to those of anorexia nervosa patients despite their underweight status. Low BMI patients with CTD-ILD who have potential soft tissue weakness are presumably at risk of alveolar wall rupture. In contrast, regarding high LDH levels, Chu et al. (37) reported that high peak LDH levels were associated with the development of pneumomediastinum in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. LDH is ubiquitous within the body, and because of this non-specificity, little evidence exists regarding whether or not LDH levels are positively correlated with CTD-ILD activity or severity. However, several pulmonary disorders, including ILD, are known to increase serum LDH levels via cell damage, inflammation or both (38) . Notably, since the first report was published in 1968 (39) , serum LDH has been a traditional biomarker for ILD. Collectively, evidence suggests that not only a low BMI but also high LDH levels at baseline signify potential alveolar wall weakening due to damage or inflammation. In the present study, the levels of KL-6, a biomarker for evaluating the severity of CTD-ILD with high sensitivity and specificity (40), were not significantly different between the two groups. However, the PaO2 and %DLCO values were significantly lower in patients with pneumomediastinum than in those without it. A previous study found that the serum KL-6 levels peak after starting treatment and then decrease gradually to baseline (41) . Unlike PaO2 and %DLCO, the serum KL-6 levels at baseline would not reflect ongoing lung injury and fibrosis.",

Based on our results, patients with a low BMI and/or high LDH levels at baseline may have soft tissue weakness, including within the alveolar walls, and may be predisposed to develop pneumomediastinum. Within the literature, several underlying mechanisms of pneumomediastinum with regard to the tissue status have already been proposed. Yamanishi et al. (14) reported that weakening of the interstitial lung tissue from steroids may contribute to pneumomediastinum pathogenesis, and another report found that increases in the air cystic space as a result of interstitial pneumonia and fibrosis may increase the risk of pneumomediastinum (42) . Furthermore, alveolar ruptures associated with an elevated alveolar pressure or damage (due to infection or aspiration) are the most common causes of pneumomediastinum (1, 43) .",

            "text": "In the present study, associated factors that all pneumomediastinum patients had in common were either a low BMI and/or high LDH levels, the use of corticosteroids and underlying ILD indicated for treatment. Although these unchangeable factors resulted in pneumomediastinum, after the initiation of corticosteroid therapy, we were able to take ablative measures for other factors that increased the alveolar pressure or damaged the alveoli. We therefore propose the following approaches: 1) when using ventilator support (e.g., in acute exacerbation of ILD), it is reasonable to minimize pressure settings; 2) cough suppressants (when needed) are also recommended for reducing alveolar pressure; and 3) treatment strategies vary according to the clinical situation of each individual, although immunosuppression remains the mainstay of treatment for ILD (44) . Even in ILD patients with a low BMI and/or high LDH levels, if needed, mPSL pulse therapy is recommended to avoid a fatal outcome. It is essential to reduce the disease activity or inflammation with the aim of preventing progression to fibrosis, and importantly, combination therapy with immunosuppressive agents allows for the tapering of corticosteroids. It is speculated that these approaches may help prevent the development of pneumomediastinum in CTD-ILD patients, especially in those with a low BMI and/or high LDH levels at baseline. Despite the fact that pneumomediastinum itself is unlikely to cause death, it imposes a huge burden on patients in terms of symptoms, the need for bed rest, interference with activities of daily living and a prolonged duration of hospitalization. Thus, identifying patients at particularly high risk and taking measures to prevent it are extremely important.",

First, we were unable to fully describe the usefulness of the BMI and LDH as definitive prognostic factors because of the retrospective design. Second (and consistent with previous reports), even though it was evident that CADM accounts for the majority of pneumomediastinum with DM, CADM itself was not an independent significant factor in this study. This lack of significance in the multivariable analysis may be due to the low proportion of CADM patients in the pneumomediastinum group, which consisted of 9 patients (69%) with CTD other than CADM. As the proportion of CADM among all CTD-ILD patients was less precise, it could thus not be definitively argued that CADM was not a risk factor for developing pneumomediastinum. Third, this study focused on hospitalized patients, so mild patients might have been excluded from the analysis. Finally, the treatment choice and evaluations performed were entirely dependent on the discretion of the individual physicians, which may have led to biased results. Further prospective, large-scale studies will be needed to confirm our findings.",
