The outbreak of the COVID-19 has highlighted the problems confronting the global governance of international public health, such as limited functions of international organizations and difficulties in achieving objectives, poor collaboration between governance subjects and their limited performance, overlapping legal basis of governance and blurred core function, and lack of solutions to special problems. The corresponding approaches can be taken to improve the efficiency of the governance of global public health, including supporting the role of international organizations to achieve the objectives, enhancing coordination among international governance subjects to form synergy, promoting the compliance with IHR2005 to avoid conflict of law application and upholding the vision of a community with a shared future for mankind to jointly respond to the special problems.",

COVID-19 is characterized with strong transmissibility, infectiousness in its incubation period and threat to people's health and even life (1) . Given the growing number of patients and reports of the epidemic in many countries around the world, the Committee of the World Health Organization (WHO), in accordance with International Health Regulations (2005) (IHR2005), agreed that the outbreak meets the criteria for a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on the evening of 30 January 2020. It is thus clear that PHEIC becomes a global concern because of the growing interdependence of countries across the world in the face of disasters.",

            "text": "As early as the second half of the 19th century, the impact of international public health events had become one of the world's concerns (2) . After the Second World War, the UN's Economic and Social Council held an international health conference in New York in July 1946, where the Constitution of the World Health Organization was adopted, along with a plan to establish the WHO. WHO, the world's organization to handle international health issues has, since its establishment, played an important guiding and promoting role in the cooperation to tackle international health issues, the prevention and control of infectious diseases, the improvement of theoretical research and practice of biomedicine, the development of health undertakings within member countries, and the improvement of people's health. Health has an intrinsic value to the individual and to the society (3) . The preamble to the WHO Constitution embodies this aspiration. The development of society, along with the frequent international economic, trade and personnel exchanges, has also accelerated the globalization of public health. Public health has emerged as one of the most important issues of our global age. Globalization propels pathogens, placing us at risk (4) . For centuries, several beliefs and political ideologies have existed on disease and its transmission (5) . For instance, the first recorded smallpox epidemic began in Egypt in 1350 BCE. It reached China in 49 CE, Europe after 700, the Americas in 1,520, and Australia in 1,789. The bubonic plague, or \"Black Death, \" originated in Asia, but it spread to Europe in the fourteenth century, where it killed a fourth to a third of the population. Europeans carried diseases to the Americas in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that destroyed up to 95 percent of the indigenous population (6) . From the 1980s just to the mid-twenty-first century, 2013-15, there were more than 12,000 major outbreaks of novel diseases, 215 infectious diseases, 44 million cases in 219 countries (4) . Never before have public health problems been featured so urgently and comprehensively in the political, economic, and social dynamics of domestic and world affairs (7) .",

These international public health events have left human efforts to control them in more uncertainty and difficulties. Governance challenges for global health have long fascinated legal scholars and political scientists (9) . With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, it is high time to re-examine the current landscape of international health cooperation, which is underpinned by various legal norms, processes and institutions (10) . The outbreak of COVID-19 will again test the effectiveness of IHR specifically, and the moral and legal legitimacy of the WHO as a global health agency more broadly (10) . It has placed the issue of international public health governance once again into the focus of the international community.",

            "text": "COVID-19 has been regarded as the \"black swan\" event of 2020, causing massive upheaval to businesses and impacting economic ecosystems on an unprecedented scale (11) . While the WHO has been praised for its quickness in handling some of the more technical aspects of fighting a global pandemic, countries are taking their own approaches to the virus. In the case of China, early lockdown and forced quarantine measures seem to have been effective but such measures are not as easily implemented elsewhere (12) . In South Korea, the focus has been on tracing the virus's spread through free, massive testing and then treating those who test positive. Social distancing has been encouraged through school closures, teleworking, and bans on large gatherings but forced quarantine has not been implemented (13) . Italy and Spain, who delayed their containment strategies, have both favored less restrictive lockdown methods, though restrictions have increased as the situations in both countries have become more dire (14) . In Germany, it is mainly local and regional governments that are responsible for health issues. The federal government's role is in most cases limited to coordinating the measures undertaken by the regional governments and to recommend a specific course of action for the whole country (15) . Traditional global health leaders, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, proved unprepared for, and inept in responding to, the coronavirus (16) . In the United Kingdom, a strategy of containment, delay, research, and mitigation have produced mixed results. Schools in the U.K. stayed open longer than countries on the continent and initial restrictive measures were aimed more at the most vulnerable like the elderly and those with comorbidities. While delaying actions may have allowed the U.K. to stave off some of the social and economic costs of the virus, it does not appear to have greatly lessened the spread of COVID-19 (17) . The approach favored by several African countries has been stronger border protection via flight restrictions, visa denials, and 2-week quarantines for foreigners entering the country. While the numbers of infected persons remain lower on the African continent, it's unclear if this can be attributed to the tightening of borders (18) .",

However, the ability of WHO to affect national health decisions that impinge widely on economic and social life is limited by a world order dominated by independent nations (20) . Obligations stipulated in the IHR2005 are based on seeking a balance between the national and the international community's interest. Meanwhile, the world's central health agency, WHO, lacks the legal authority to ensure equitable, needs-based distribution of medical supplies and equipment and vaccines and therapies, during a pandemic, heightening the vulnerability of people in poorer countries (21) . By contrast, regimes such as the World Trade Organization give primacy to intellectual property protection rather than affordable biotechnologies (22) . The World Bank and International Monetary Fund ushered in an era of user fees for health services and structural adjustment that diminished national health budgets (22) . And laissez-faire capitalism gives carte blanche for transnational corporations to move to low-tax, low-regulation states, thus depleting domestic resources for health and failing to regulate corporate marketing, products, workplace safety, and environmental impacts that harm the public's health and safety (22) .",

Therefore, they certainly do not provide us with warrant for a functionalist account of how governance arrangements for globalization would emerge, since the causal mechanism for selection seems even weaker at the global level than with respect to competition among states (23) .

Think about transnational forces such as greenhouse gas emissions, or global rules and norms in areas such as trade and investment (22) , or transnational corporations that actively seek low-tax, low-regulation destinations-or the rapid spread of communicable diseases, like COVID-19. Geographically, the development imbalance can be observed at both the inter-state and intra-state levels. Whenever an epidemic breaks out, it is the affected country or region that responds first and needs the active response from other countries. The states that bear the disproportionate burden of disease have the least capacity to do anything about it, and the states that have the wherewithal are deeply resistant to expending the political capital and economic resources necessary to truly make a difference to improve health outside their borders (29) . Despite IHR2005's demands of its member's improvement in their domestic health conditions, developing countries, economically and technologically backward, are still unable to improve their domestic public health systems. Large cities and rural areas within the same country are faced with different challenges when responding to a pandemic, due to, for example, the density of population and the state of the infrastructure (15) . It is difficult for them to provide adequate medical materials within a short time to deal with PHEIC.

When the progress of globalization comes to a halt, governments are finding their commitment to free trade no longer the first priority (33) . Therefore, by calibrating health and trade interests, the IHR resonate with international trade law under the WTO, which also recognizes the state's right to restrict trade for health purposes but limits this right to ensure that restrictions are necessary (34) . Articles 7 and 8 of the TRIPS Agreement could represent both \"context\" and \"purpose\" in interpreting other TRIPS provisions pursuant to article 31.1 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties and thereby temper the strong rights granted to intellectual property holders by the TRIPS Agreement. However, they are fairly vague and aspirational provisions and therefore would be unlikely to resolve difficulties where the drafting is unambiguous and the \"ordinary meaning\" of given treaty terms are clear, as is arguably the case for compulsory licensing in connection with patented pharmaceuticals (35) . Although it has become the consensus of international organizations and regions to strengthen international cooperation in addressing global health issues, unified coordination is still insufficient on how to regulate and guarantee international cooperation. With a plethora of international organizations sharing lawmaking authority for global health and with other health actors engaged in the international legislative process, international lawmaking shows potential for fragmented, uncoordinated and inefficient sprawl (9) . The most important structural shortcoming of IHR is the lack of enforceable sanctions. For example, if a country fails to explain why it has adopted more restrictive traffic and trade measures than those recommended by WHO, no legal consequences follow. Based on the experiences of handling COVID-19 up to the time of writing this paper, it is apparent that there are many operational problems with the IHR2005. The role of the IHR2005 seems not to be critical in guiding States Parties for tackling the outbreak (36) . The manner in which the pandemic exposed controversies and gaps in international law suggests that global health governance lack an effective system of law (16) .",

Concerns over potential erosions in democracy and respect for human rights caused by government responses to the COVID-19 pandemic are situated among broader worries over worldwide democratic backsliding in recent years (37) . As governments worldwide administer lockdowns, travel limitations, and other restrictions to respond to the COVID-19, some experts have warned of a \"parallel epidemic\" of government repression (38) . Meanwhile, even when restrictions may be justified on the basis of public health, the manner of application and enforcement of these measures may raise human rights concerns in some cases (37) . The increasing \"securitization\" of health law means it may become a primary instrument of abusive and arbitrary state power (39) . For example, several states have deployed surreptitious cell phone technologies to track persons potentially infected with COVID-19 and their contacts (40) . Take the Infodemic as an example. \"Infodemic, \" like epidemics (41), involves the rapid spread of information of all kinds, including rumors, gossip and unreliable information. The world is in an era of network connectivity, information flooding and rapid dissemination. Once a public health emergency breaks out in a certain place, it will quickly become the focus of the world, and there will be a variety of online comments mixed with rational analysis and impetuous noise. Infodemic is an important part of outbreak response. It encompasses three main areas: (1) monitoring and identifying health threats, (2) outbreaks investigation, and (3) actions for mitigation and control (41) . Behind this there are two reasons. First, to prevent the spread of the epidemic, the affected cities and countries may adopt lockdown policy, which increases the expectation of facts and security concerns. Second, people will feel worried about reality, which will be of little help. After the outbreak of COVID-19, the public media and Internet have been full of different voices, seriously denting the morale and enthusiasm of the people affected by the epidemic to fight against the epidemic. In view of this kind of phenomenon, some states have promulgated the bounded restrictions on the exercise some human rights, which arouses disputes. Experts worry that some restrictions fail to meet necessary principles to ensure respect for human rights (42) . Others contend that during the pandemic, there has been increased pressure on civil liberties, such as threats to freedom of opinion, discussion, press freedom for journalists covering the news and scientists who had different opinions on the results of their research or studies (43) . States of emergency are built on the somewhat artificial dichotomy of norm and exception, which endorses a bifurcated approach to balancing the interests of societal goals and individual rights (43) . Therefore, the extent to which COVID-19-related restrictions represent a departure from past governance patterns also may vary between states (37).",

Much will depend on the allocation of competencies in the individual State as far as health issues are concerned (15) . These different policy responses will often be transformed into different legal actions, so these patterns are helpful in understanding the role of law in connection with the globalization of public health (44) . Health justice, then, is a fundamentally global concept and requires health equality within and across countries and regions (45) .

The virtual warehouse is mainly used to store scarce raw materials and medical resources. Health financing is a critical, but often neglected, component of global governance of health (10) . The funding sources of the warehouse can be divided into the following categories. a. reserved assessed amount by states parties. Member states claim a corresponding amount of medical products in proportion to their contributions on a yearly basis; b. social donation. The virtual warehouse is open to the whole society, so that all organizations, enterprises and individuals can provide targeted donations; c. additional donation. Countries with national supply or domestic manufacturing capacity contribute additional medical supplies to the virtual warehouse in addition to their assessed amounts. WHO acts as the manager of the virtual warehouse. In the event of a major outbreak, the affected country or region may apply for allocation of resources in accordance with the procedures prescribed by WHO.

As a consequence of globalization, governments must turn increasingly to international cooperation to attain national public health objectives and achieve some control over the trans-boundary forces that affect their populations (32) . As a result, countries in today's world have long formed an interdependent relationship. Interdependence leads to shared benefits, which in turn encourage mutual cooperation. Public health features universality, actuality and practicality in its application, because it involves the fundamental and pervasive aspects of people's lives, so it is easier for public health to be generally recognized and applied. Therefore, cooperation is conducive to the well-being of the people, and will achieve the cooperative positive effect. With the rapid outbreak of the novel coronavirus across the global, effective containment of the outbreak requires global concerted efforts (10) . Leadership from heads of state and government could help propel these ideas onto national and global agendas, providing critical support (21) . Having paid a disastrously heavy price, the international community has eventually woken up and strengthened joint efforts in combating the virus (50) . The G20 Extraordinary Leader's Summit held on March 26 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic marked the formation of an international consensus, where leaders expressed their commitment to \"task our top relevant officials to coordinate closely in support of the global efforts to counter the pandemic's impacts.\" Countries should cooperate actively in the face of a public health event. First, the affected countries or regions should take measures as soon as possible to prevent the epidemic from spreading to other countries. Second, other countries should help the affected countries as much as possible. State and local health departments are key to protecting the nation from epidemics (51) . In today's globalized world, to help other countries to break away from the impact of public health events is essentially to help oneself. To take China as an example, in its fighting against the sudden outbreak of COVID-19, China has received support and assistance from foreign governments, enterprises, non-governmental organizations as well as friendly people worldwide. As its domestic situation was gradually stabilizing, China began providing support and assistance in various forms to the WHO and related UN agencies, neighboring countries, developing nations, and even the United States and European countries, which has been widely praised by the international community (52) .",

While the WHO recognizes its responsibility as stated in the Constitution for nomenclature of diseases, it has also been mindful of its functions to co-ordinate with other UN Specialized Agencies and scientific and technical groups (5) . The vast array of international health actors actively involved in global health cooperation, combined with people's widespread criticism of the United Nations and its specialized agencies, have led some commentators to suggest a diminishing role for intergovernmental organizations in global health governance. Achieving global health justice requires authentic cooperation because the production of health equity at the global and domestic levels involves interdependent parties. This task requires individuals and groups to embrace and successfully fulfill respective roles and responsibilities based on functions and needs and voluntary commitments (53) . Some have emphasized a \"power shift\" from intergovernmental organizations to privatesector actors and the innovative health coalitions described above (54) . Because public-private partnerships have proliferated since 2,000, the contractual relationships between firms, governments, and large health-oriented foundations will serve as a significant source of global health law (19) . The dispersal of governance in contemporary history has occurred not only across different layers and scales of social relations from the local to the global, but also with the emergence of various regulatory mechanisms in private quarters alongside those in the public sector (25) . People are demanding decent health services. They want caring, compassionate, and highly qualified professionals. They demand affordable access to essential medicines, vaccines, and medical devices (21) . To effectively respond to major disease outbreak, in addition to the government and scientific research institutions, large pharmaceutical enterprises and research and development centers also play an active role with their advanced research resources, and strong capability of R&D on immune and anti-epidemic drug. What's more, in combating the epidemic, donations from all walks of life have greatly alleviated the plight of medical resource shortage and material shortage in the mostaffected areas. Given today's high-tech development, technology companies that dominating artificial intelligence and medical drug development are an indispensable in the fight against infectious diseases. The large number of volunteers are also a solid force for countries to deal with the outbreak. Therefore, WHO and countries should actively support and encourage enterprises and individuals to make joint efforts.",

The 2003 SARS outbreak killed 916 people in 32 countries and regions, according to figures released by WHO on August 15, 2003 (55) . The challenge for post-Westphalian public health is to create the conditions necessary for the governance innovations practiced in the SARS outbreak to be refined, improved, expanded, and sustained to meet the ongoing threats pathogenic microbes present (56) . WHO adopted a series of internal working regulations and the IHR2005, which requires all countries to develop and maintain core health system capacities (4) . Designed to enhance international health cooperation and provide an international legal framework, the IHR2005 aims to prevent, protect against, control and provide a public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are commensurate with and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. Global health law encompasses the legal norms, processes, and institutions needed to create the conditions for people throughout the world to attain the highest possible level of physical and mental health (57) . The need for international law in global public health is greater, however, than the attitudes of any particular WHO administration. WHO needs to take international law more seriously because the structure of international politics places international law in a central position in state's attempts to deal with global problems (44) . Although the IHR2005 is the main international agreement on infectious diseases, the regulations do not govern every challenge that disease events create (16) . The role of international law in the global governance is to guarantee the international public interest.",

Therefore, it is significant to recognize the need for universal adherence to and implementation of the rule of law at both the national and international levels. Against the background of global governance, a feasible means of addressing problems of global concern and avoiding power struggles among nations is to set up an international code of conduct through international collaboration and, on this basis, establish a predicable international system and develop a just and effective model of global governance (58) . IHR2005 is both the norms of international law to deal with international public health problems formed on this basis, and also the basis of the international order followed by various subjects of international public health governance. Obviously, public health is critical to almost all major global governance issues, including national and international security, trade and economic development, environmental protection and human rights. IHR2005 has changed the traditional ways international community handles public health issues, and provided an important platform for extensive international communication.",

In the field of trade in goods, some have argued that in response to such concerns countries should pursue legal actions through the WTO and Article XX (b) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in order to ban potentially dangerous imports until the safety of such goods can be effectively established (59) . The interdependence between international and national law emphasized by global health jurisprudence tends to be more robust when law supports governance actions that integrate power and ideas in a coherent and sustainable manner (7) .

Therefore, the IHR2005 not only stipulates the goals of international public health governance, but also incorporates the principle of human rights into its implementation system, thus constructing the public health system that integrates security, economy, people's livelihood, development and human dignity with the attributes of public goods, rather than the previous IHR2005 only limited to removing restrictions on trade and travel. Public opinions are the sum of the beliefs, attitudes, and emotions of the public in response to the phenomena and problems in the society, mixed with rational and irrational factors. However, how public opinions are developed determines whether their effects on social development and the course of events are positive or negative. In the modern society featuring highly developed Internet access, people's ideas and values are more diversified, so are their ways of receiving information and channels of spreading information.
