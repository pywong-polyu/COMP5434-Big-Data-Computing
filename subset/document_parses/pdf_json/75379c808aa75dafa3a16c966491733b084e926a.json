First, healthcare systems should adopt a digital inclusion-informed strategy regarding mobile health that (1) recognizes their community's level of access to devices and Internet connectivity and (2) supports patients in their initial and sustained technology use. Digital inclusion refers to the activities necessary to ensure equitable access to and use of information and communication technologies, including (1) affordable broadband Internet service, (2) Internet-enabled devices, (3) access to digital literacy training, (4) quality technical support, and (5) applications and online content designed to enable and encourage self-sufficiency, participation, and collaboration 13 . These form the foundation for use of mobile technology in healthcare. While knowing whether an individual's access is important, it is vital for health systems to understand the larger environment shaping patients' digital experience.

Smartphones may seem to be a logical and ubiquitous substitute for home Internet, but significant gaps still exist for rural, poor, and older adults. Research shows that nearly one-half of older adults and 30% of those earning less than $30,000 own a smartphone and many low-income households share devices, raising both access and privacy issues 15 .

This became particularly clear since the rapid and pervasive shift to telehealth during the COVID-19 pandemic. Simply asking patients what devices they own and how they access the Internet is not typical in the clinical context, but this information can shape the type of technology a clinician can recommend. The lack of routine assessment prior to COVID-19 meant that some patients fell between the cracks as care shifted to nearly all virtual 17 . Incorporating this and other SDOH into the EHR encourages more consistent documentation and allows assessment of population-level metrics of access 18 . When digital skill and connectivity gaps are assessed systematically and universally, a health system can document overall population-level metrics, examine disparities, and track changes over time.",

Yet, we must be cognizant of their potential to increase health disparities. National efforts have been undertaken to promote broadband, such as the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) Lifeline program that subsidizes the cost of smartphones and Internet service for low-income individuals 24, 25 . However, the Lifeline Program's impact is limited by low consumer awareness, and the qualification process varies by state and by the service provider. In addition, Internet service may still be unaffordable even with the monthly subsidy. Another program, the Federal Broadband Opportunities Program, supported over 4 million people to get online for the first time with a $4 billion program but those one-time dollars are long gone, leaving a gap in the need for adult digital literacy support. BTOP has only two remaining operational programs with no new funding on the horizon 25, 26 . In response to the current COVID-19 pandemic, the FCC also introduced a variety of programs to increase Internet access for the use of telehealth, including paying for devices and access. However, the future of these programs after the COVID-19 pandemic is unclear 13 .
