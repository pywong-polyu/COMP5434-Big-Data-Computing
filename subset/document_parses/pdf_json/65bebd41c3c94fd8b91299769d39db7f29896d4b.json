Overall, these reports have documented that LAMP-based methods have comparable sensitivity and specificity to that of RT-qPCR. More importantly, LAMP methods provide attractive advantages over RT-qPCR methods in terms of lower capital and operating costs. LAMP is an isothermal method, so it frees the user from the need for a costly thermal cycler. In addition, LAMP methods that exhibit excellent sensibility and acceptable specificity have been described for the extraction-free analysis of nasopharyngeal and even saliva samples [14, 16, 17] . The release from the need for an extraction stage further reduces the cost of LAMP methodology.",

            "text": "However, colorimetric LAMP methods also have some limitations. One is that the adequate performance of colorimetric LAMP mediated by phenol red depends on the initial pH of the sample. This is particularly relevant in extraction-free applications, since acidic samples may prematurely shift the color of the reaction mix, even in noninfected samples, thereby possibly rendering false positives. Indeed, the direct implementation of colorimetric LAMP in saliva samples is technically challenging. Human saliva exhibits a wide range of pH values [21, 22] ; therefore, even small volumes of saliva may significantly affect the initial pH of the reaction mix in LAMP-based methods. Acidic saliva samples may induce a premature shift in the pH (and the color) that is not associated with amplification and will eventually lead to a false positive diagnosis. The direct and real-time reading of electric potential throughout the amplification offers a solution to some of the limitations of final-point colorimetric LAMP methods in the context of the analysis of saliva samples. LAMP-based methods also use from four to six primer sets, and the design of LAMP primer sets is nontrivial as the primers may interact among themselves during amplification. This can promote nonspecific amplifications that may also result in false positives [23, 24] .",

In general, nonspecific amplification is believed to be the main reason for false positives in LAMP colorimetric reactions. Figure 4A shows the typical profile of the progression of the electric potential in negative samples (with primers and reaction mix but no SARS-CoV-2 template). Four representative replicates are shown. The shape of the progression of the electric potential in the negative samples is highly consistent. Figure 4B presents a normalization of the four representative curves shown in Figure 4A . The curves were normalized by subtracting the initial potential value for each curve. In doing so, all curves practically collapse into an invariant shape. The grey line in Figure 4B depicts the average of the four curves corresponding to independently run negative samples. This profile, characteristic of negative samples, is distinguishable from that inherent to the specific amplification observed in samples that do contain SARS-CoV-2 genetic material. Figure 4C shows the trajectories of the electric potential associated with positive samples containing different quantities of SARS-CoV-2 synthetic genetic material (color curves; i.e., in the range of 10 to 1,000 copies of the N gene of SARS-CoV-2).",

Figure 4C shows that the electrical potential in the reaction mix exhibits a distinctive, practically immediate, and sharp increase at the incubation conditions upon the addition of primers. This increase is associated with a high initial rate of amplification. Noticeably, the initial slope of the potential curve is steeper in positive samples than in negative samples. The typical smoother progression associated with negative samples ( Figure 4B ) was also observed in negative saliva samples; the average progression of the electric potential in negative samples is indicated by the green line. The amplification curves that corresponded to samples spiked with SARS-CoV-2 genetic material exhibited a steep slope that was immediately observable upon initiation of the reaction by the addition of primers. A high sampling rate is required in the monitoring device for a clear identification of this steep initial slope. In our experiments, we achieved the resolution needed to identify the sharp slope associated with samples that contained SARS-CoV-2 genetic material by sampling at least once per second (the Arduino code is available in Supplementary File S1). Lower sampling rates (e.g., 0.2 Hz) do not serve the purpose of clearly resolving the initial slope of the reaction in positive samples ( Figure S3 ). We also observed that the evolution of each curve is consistent with the copy load in the positive samples, so that higher copy numbers originate curves with a higher initial slope than is observed for curves associated with lower loads. Since the initial rate of amplification is remarkably high in positive samples (>25 to 75 mV s \u22121 ), the differences between slopes can be clearly established only if high sampling rates (~1 sample s \u22121 : 1 Hz) are imposed.",

The IP 3 values were clearly higher in positive samples than in negative samples. The positive samples with low to medium SARS-CoV-2 gene copy loads were also clearly distinguishable from negative samples. In addition, a linear correlation can be established between the logarithm of the copy number and the value of the integral ( Figure 5B) . Similarly, the plot of IP 3 versus time is practically a straight line ( Figure 4D ); the value of the slope of this plot also correlates with the number of SARS-CoV-2 gene copies originally present in a sample ( Figure 5C,D) . These results suggest that IP 3 (and the slope of the linear plot of IP 3 versus time) are reliable and quantitative indicators of the specific amplification of genetic material in saliva samples. The IP3 value is an indicator of the extent of specific amplification that is somehow analogous to the progression of the change of color (from red-magenta to crisp yellow; Figure S4 ) during the amplification in colorimetric LAMP. However, the time scale at which color and electric potential evolve differs quite drastically. Changes in color are observable at a much slower rate-positive and negative samples can be discriminated due to their color evolution within the first 30 min of reaction ( Figure S4A) . Remarkably, the evolution of the IP3 indicator introduced here enables a reliable discrimination between positive and negative samples within the initial 3 min of the reaction.",

Remarkably, this The IP 3 value is an indicator of the extent of specific amplification that is somehow analogous to the progression of the change of color (from red-magenta to crisp yellow; Figure S4 ) during the amplification in colorimetric LAMP. However, the time scale at which color and electric potential evolve differs quite drastically. Changes in color are observable at a much slower rate-positive and negative samples can be discriminated due to their color evolution within the first 30 min of reaction ( Figure S4A) . Remarkably, the evolution of the IP 3 indicator introduced here enables a reliable discrimination between positive and negative samples within the initial 3 min of the reaction.",

The typical concentration of gene copies of SARS-CoV-2 in the saliva of positive subjects (even asymptomatic ones) is generally higher than 10 5 mL \u22121 (10 2 \u00b5L \u22121 ). In the analysis presented here, 2 \u00b5L of undiluted saliva can be added without observing inhibitory effects in terms of the extent of the amplification. Therefore, copy number values greater than 10 2 per assay can be expected. Based on our experiments, the limit of detection/discrimination of this method, assisted by online monitoring of the electric potential of the solution during amplification, is one orders of magnitude below this (i.e., 10 SARS-CoV-2 copies per assay), suggesting that the presented method could render reliable diagnosis of COVID-19 in unextracted (undiluted or diluted) saliva samples that have even moderate or low viral loads. This hypothesis remains to be tested by the diagnostic evaluation of saliva samples from actual patients and, at this point, should be taken as an inference.",

The successful performance of this diagnostic strategy is centered on the ability to sample the electric potential (or pH) of the reaction mix frequently (the authors recommend at least 1.0 Hz) during the initial stage of the amplification reaction (i.e., at least during the initial three minutes). Failure to do this may hinder the resolution of the readings during the first seconds of the amplification due to a lag in the response or the adjustment of the sensor to the pH conditions ( Figure S3 ). Further, in the current developmental state of our diagnostic device, we depend on the use of commercial pH microelectrodes that are relatively expensive. The development of disposable and low-cost pH microelectrodes should be a priority for enabling the cost-effective use of this strategy to intensify the ability to perform label-free and portable/mobile molecular diagnostics of SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogens.",
