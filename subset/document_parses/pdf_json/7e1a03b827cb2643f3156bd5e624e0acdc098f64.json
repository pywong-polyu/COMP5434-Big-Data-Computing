The present study was carried out with a specific aim to computationally evaluate and identify compounds derived from Bacillus species as the plausible inhibitors against 3-chymotrypsin-like main protease (3CLpro) or main protease (M Pro ), which is a key enzyme in the life-cycle of coronavirus. The compounds were isolated from the crude extracts of Bacillus species. Among the isolated compounds, novel inhibitory leads were identified using in silico techniques. Molecular docking revealed that stigmasterol (-8.3 kcal/mol), chondrillasterol (-7.9 kcal/mol) and hexadecnoic acid (-6.9 kcal/mol)) among others bind in the substrate-binding pocket and also interacted with the catalytic dyad of the 3-CLpro. Further evaluation using 50 ns molecular dynamic simulation and MMPB-GBSA indicated that among the top three docking hits, hexadecanoic acid was found to be the most promising anti-COVID-19 lead against the main protease. Hexadecanoic acid might serve as a potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 compound to combat COVID-19, however, in vitro and in vivo validation and optimization is needed.",

WHO declares coronavirus infection (COVID-19) as a public health emergency of international concern, affecting millions of people, and it is spreading worldwide with a mortality rate of approximately 3% (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019). COVID-19 has clinically significant characteristics that cause certain disease conditions such as; pneumonia, fever, difficulty in breathing, infection of the lung. Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect large number of vertebrates. CoVs species are zoonotic and transmitted to humans via droplets of different sizes. A total of six coronavirus species are responsible for inducing clinical complications in humans. Four out of six named as; 229E, OC43, NL63, and HKU1 are most common and generally cause common cold in immune-compromised individuals . The remaining two strains named; Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) are zoonotic and cause severe clinical complications (Cui et al., 2019) . The 3 C-like protease (3CLpro) along with papain-like protease(s) is the main protease enzyme that is significant for the processing of the viral polyproteins (John et al., 2015) . This role of 3CLpro in duplication of the virus makes it an ideal drug target for the identification and designing of potent anti-SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors.",

Both of them create an interactive network that constitutes the basis for life on the planet Earth (Cani & Knauf, 2016; Nicholson et al., 2012; O'Mahony et al., 2015) . Bioactive compounds produced by microorganisms are quite significant for developing novel drugs and diverse substances with various biological activities, including antifungal, antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, anticancer, and antiviral. These new substances and novel drugs are costeffective and highly efficient (Lavecchia & Di Giovanni, 2013; Tripathi & Misra, 2017) . Bacteria of the Bacillus genus are gram-positive, rod-shaped, and can form endospores. Due to their diversity in physiological properties, they have the ability to produced plethora of antimicrobial compounds (AMCs) (at least 4-5% of its genome) to favour their ubiquitous distribution in soil and environment (Caulier et al., 2019) .",

Preparatory steps were followed as mentioned; addition of polar hydrogens to the protein structure, checking for missing residues, generation of pdbqt files for both ligands and receptor along with the setting of grid box around the active site was accomplished by using GUI program of Auto Dock Tool (Morris et al., 2009) . The grid size dimensions were allowed as 40 \u00c2 40 \u00c2 40 along X, Y, and Z axes with 0.375 \u00c5 spacing. The pdbqt files with grid box properties were recorded into a configuration file. During the docking run, both protein and ligand were treated as rigid entities. In positional RMSD, the results of less than 1.0 \u00c5 were clustered and were characterized in the most conducive free energy of binding. For further analysis, a low binding affinity pose has been extracted and aligned with the protein. The docking protocol was validated by docking cocrystallized N inhibitor at the active site of 3CLpro using the same parameters described above and the predicted pose was found the same as reported in the crystal structure thus validating the docking procedure.",

Also, the docked complexes were rescored using MMPBSA to verify the docking results and to rank the binding affinities accordingly. Based on the results of MMPBSA, it was concluded that hexadecnoic acid-3CLpro is the most stable complex for further study compared to stigmasterol-3CLpro and chondrillasterol-3CLpro docked complexes with better docking affinities. The estimated average potential energy for the hexadecnoic acid-3CLpro complex after 50 ns was \u00c0144302 kcal/mol which revealed the complex's stability. The RMSD plot showed that protein attains the equilibrium after 1 ns and remains stable till 50 ns with few minor deviations and an average RMSD value of 1.6 \u00c5 (Figure 8a) . Snapshots extracted at different intervals revealed that around 10 ns the compound moved a little bit from the initial docked conformation, binds into the substrate-binding pocket, and catalytic dyad (HIS41, CYS145) and stays there till the entire simulation run. Visualization through the using Discovery Studio showed that both the residues of the catalytic dyad (HIS41 and CYS145) along with MET160 were involved in pi-alkyl and alkyl interactions. THR190 and GLN198 were involved in a conventional hydrogen bond as well as a carbon-hydrogen bond, respectively. Thirteen residues, including the residues of substrate binding site (THR25, THR26, LEU27, ASN28, TYR54, ASN119, ASN142, GLY143, SER144, HIE164, ASP187, GLN189, and ALA191) were interacting using van der Waals interactions to form a stable complex (Figure 9a and b) . Most of these residues have been reported as crucial because of their involvement in the formation of the substrate-binding pocket (Jin et al., 2020) . The plot for the radius of gyration also revealed that the system attained compactness and stability (22.2 \u00c5) and the results achieved are consistent with the results of RMSD stated herein (Figure 8b ). The RMSF analysis was conducted to Illustrating the active site residues of best-docked conformation selected for stigmasterol-3CLpro, visualized using Chimera. Residues of substrate binding sites are shown in black color whereas catalytic dyad residues are shown in reddish-orange color. explore the per residue fluctuations of the system. The binding of Hexadecnoic-Acid has been shown to make proteins less flexible, especially in regions containing catalytic dyad and interacting residues of pocket. The average RMSF for the system was 1.02 \u00c5, especially for HIS41 and CYS145 it was estimated as 0.50 \u00c5 and 0.71 \u00c5 (Figure 8c ). For the residue of domain III, especially residues 300-303, a higher fluctuation of approximately 4.66 \u00c5 was observed. The possible reason for this higher fluctuation could be the involvement of domain III in the formation of a homodimer. RMSD plot for ligand showed few deviations with an average RMSD of 2.05 \u00c5 (Figure 10a ). When snapshots for the ligand were analyzed, it was observed that the deviations in the RMSD plot were because of the flexibility of the carboxyl group. As shown in Figure 10 b at 10 th , 15 th, and 45 th ns this group showed a major deviation from the initial conformation. The chain of carbon atoms remained stable throughout the simulation run playing an anchoring role in the binding of the compound to the protein. This finding could be significant for the future design of potent compounds that use this compound as the lead. The compound's flexible moiety may be substituted by another group that may limit its movement and the ability to increase the potency that optimally inhibits the 3CLpro. Over the entire simulation run, the complex remains stable.",

To gain insight into the stable complex, it is therefore essential to assess the number of hydrogen bonds between protein-ligand interacting regions. The hydrogen bond plot for hexadecnoic acid-3CLpro docked complex generated by VMD is shown in Figure 11 . The figure shows that, on average, two hydrogen bonds were observed between the interactive residues and Hexadecnoic-Acid, during the entire MD spam. The results are consistent with the MD predictions.",

Very strong protein-compound interactions have been demonstrated for both approaches. The entropy has been omitted because it cannot be measured in certain situations due to convergence issues. In both techniques, the contribution of gas-phase energy to the overall net energy of the system is considerably high as compared to the net solvation energy of the system, which shows complex stability primarily due to the receptor's best confirmation with respect to the ligand. For both cases, net gas phase energy was \u00c038.29 kcal/mol. Van der Waals interactions (\u00c034.90 kcal/mol) have also contributed favorably in addition to the minor contribution from electrostatic energy towards the gas-phase energy. The total binding free energy calculated for the complex using MMPBSA and MMGBSA methods was \u00c022.42 kcal/mol and \u00c028.67 kcal/mol receptively, shown in Table 5 .",
