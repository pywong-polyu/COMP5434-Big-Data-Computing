            "text": "In contrast, current diagnostic specialty referral processes are largely open-loop 'push' systems, with few mechanisms to ensure completion, no automatic feedback and resilient adaptation systems. Information is not relayed back to the point of origin, limiting opportunities to address issues or errors and follow-up in timely manners. Existing 'open-loop' processes are associated with (1) insufficient communication throughout the diagnostic processes, (2) delays in care, (3) diagnostic results not being tracked nor addressed, (4) specialist findings and notes not being received or reviewed, (5) patient charts not being updated, and (6) patients not being notified and engaged in their care. 7 Notably, greater use of electronic health records (EHRs) does not appear to have necessarily lightened workloads, due to their lack of interoperability and easy access to necessary information often necessitating additional effort and workarounds. 8 These general types of systems problems have been advocated to be studied and redesigned via systems engineering (SE) methods by the National Academy of Medicine, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, National Science Foundation and others. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] Industries with more reliable processes that ensure completion make greater use of such methods to better understand process performance and design processes that perform with higher reliability. While complementary Open access to 'quality improvement', SE also is significantly different in terms of methods and ways of thinking about processes, performance and design. We therefore aimed to conduct an interdisciplinary formative study, combining SE and other approaches, of current diagnostic closed-loop processes in a small urban community-based health centre and a teaching practice within a large academic medical centre.",

Results were examined for stability and unnatural variation indicative of non-standardised processes. Cross functional process maps that illustrate the process steps and roles of those involved were developed for specialty referrals both in general and specifically for dermatology based on 16 group interviews with primary care physicians, scheduling staff and patient representatives from both practices (see online supplemental material for examples of interview facilitation questions).

Primary NVA activity categories included inspection or verification, data entry/storage, data querying, rework, reminders, delay/waiting and travel/transportation. Using human factors concepts, the process steps that were most susceptible to human error due to the cognitive load of the task or lack of technological support were indicated on the annotated process maps.",

For each identified failure mode, a risk priority number (RPN) was computed per convention as the product of its severity, occurrence and detectability scores (each estimated on a 1-10 scale) respective to each test site. Representatives from each test site provided and deliberated on severity, occurrence and detectability scores, where a discussion, consensus and averaging process was used in cases of differing views. Since FMEA scores might differ by patient condition, participants were asked to provide general estimates based on their experiences with patients on average. For severity scores, participants based their estimate on the potential failure's immediate effect on patients and the corresponding severity in terms of the level of patient harm/risk and delays in care. Improvement recommendations for failure modes with the highest RPNs were developed as part of the FMEA process and evaluated for feasibility, alignment with institutional priorities and potential impact.",

            "text": "While loop closing failures have been discussed in the literature, little work of this nature has analysed underlying processes from system design perspectives. Patel et al assessed the ability of a large health system to close the loop on referrals from primary care practices to specialty departments using EMR-generated data to measure scheduling rates and documentation completion after appointments. 4 Other studies have evaluated referral loop closure and failures through manual chart audits and physician and patient surveys. [24] [25] [26] While such studies acknowledge the need for innovative solutions, SE and design methodologies were not applied to address systemwide process breakdowns, communication and coordination failures, and variability in closure rates across specialties. Literature regarding interventions to close referral loops mainly focus on implementing electronic referral systems and clinical decision support systems, 27 often primarily focusing on the ordering process but not addressing problems in other referral subprocesses such as scheduling, tracking kept appointments, communication between the PCP and specialist, and follow-up. Moreover, very few publications describe effective sustainable or generalisable improvements, with many being unique to the details of a particular department or specialty in a given healthcare system.",

Most generally, fundamental or disruptive redesign of diagnostic referral processes may be necessary to achieve breakthrough improvement, with current performance levels being too low due in part to underlying designs (eg, too many steps, relying on push systems and low reliability process constructs). Incremental improvement of current referral process mental models alone, thus, may not be an effective strategy. Reliability engineering design approaches appear applicable and worthy of further exploration. Finally, existing or potential processes that require patients to assume implicit responsibility for closing care loops may introduce or exacerbate social inequities.",

FMEA and other process analysis methods rely to a certain extent on subjective estimates, although group consensus and engagement of a broad set of stakeholders likely accounted for diverse perspectives. The disruption during the study of the COVID-19 pandemic starting in early 2020 introduced frequent process changes, limited clinician availability for some meetings, and shifted institutional priorities and infrastructures. Nonetheless, the general analysis approach and nature of many findings seem applicable to other diagnostic closed-loop contexts, specialties and problems.",

Most current referral processes can be characterised by over-reliance on low reliability process designs-reminders, tracking lists, push-forward processes, limited IT use, lack of automated feedback loops and personal workarounds-resulting in poor referral completion rates and timeliness. Redesigned processes that ensure loops are closed by default, including the human factors approach of failure prevention, identification and mitigation, 19 28 and the high reliability focus on resilience, 29-31 are nearly non-existent but potentially could have significant value. SE analysis and process design methods are useful for both highlighting the nature of problems in current processes and identifying potential improvements to achieve more reliable and timely diagnostic referral processes.Contributors JCB was coprincipal investigator in this study, led all systems engineering work, contributed to the design, analysis and manuscript drafting, and is guarantor of the study conduct and content.
