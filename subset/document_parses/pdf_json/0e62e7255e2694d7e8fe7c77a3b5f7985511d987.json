The constructed networks have tripartite relationships among diseases, genes, and drugs and these interactions can be represented in the form of layered networks. In establishing a tripartite relationship between a specific disease, gene, and drug, the following three procedures should be considered for drug repurposing: (1) Find a disease that is genetically or clinically similar to COVID-19 (at the disease level); (2) Find the key gene that serves as the bio-marker or some other therapeutic evidence for COVID-19 at the gene level; (3) Find a drug that can be used to treat COVID-19 by combining or finding a drug that is already being used to treat other diseases. Given the nature of tripartite relationships, all three steps need to be done simultaneously rather than independently.

In those cases, the semi-supervised approach that can be applied when label information is insufficient is a very suitable method for recommending candidate drugs 14, 15 . Semi-supervised learning can deal with few labeled data and can perform predictions by propagating the label information to unlabeled nodes along with edges 16 . When the COVID-19 in the disease layer is set as a seed node for propagation, then the label information is transmitted through the edges of the disease-gene-drug network. The comorbidity and disease-gene association information in the disease layer are propagated to the gene and drug layer to inform the priority of the repurposable drug of COVID- 19 .

The red circles on the line correspond to the current clinical trial drugs, and the black one is not. Steroids such as dexamethasone, prednisolone, and hydrocortisone were recommended as top candidates. Among them, dexamethasone, an anti-inflammatory drug, had the highest scores.Dexamethasone is a very cheap steroid that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. COVID-19 treatment guidelines recommend usingdexamethasone 6 mg per day for up to 10 days for hospitalized patients with COVID-19 24, 25 . On the score curve, the inserted drugs between clinical-trial drugs are regarded as strong candidates even though they are not used in clinical trials. Several proposed drugs need to be considered for clinical application. First, dexamethasone, prednisolone, and hydrocortisone are steroid analogues, which affect immune and inflammatory functions. There have been reports suggesting that steroids may be effective in the control of systemic inflammation or 'cytokine storm' in severe COVID-19 cases 25 , although there are several on-going trials on the effectiveness of steroid treatment 10 . The current study also supports the possibility of steroid therapy in patients with COVID-19. Until now, there has been controversy regarding the use of NSAIDs in COVID-19 patients. Although several literatures warned the use of NSAIDs, others disagreed 26 . With acetaminophen being included as one of the highlighted drugs in our study, we wish to bring attention to the role NSAIDs may play in helping an individual with COVID-19. Given the body's inflammatory response to the virus, researchers have been studying the effects of some immune-modulating drugs including methotrexate, cyclosporin 27, 28 , although there is a paucity of information on other immune-modulating medications or cytotoxic drugs including azathioprine, doxorubicin, valproic acid, and Arsenic Trioxide. Based on the current study, further studies are needed to evaluate the possibility of immunemodulating drugs in the context of COVID-19. Several proposed drugs also need attention such as ACE inhibitors (enalapril), lipid lowering medications (simvastatin), hormonal medication(estradiol, progesterone) and antidiabetic drugs (rosiglitazone, troglitazone). These medications may be more effective in specific populations with specific comorbidities such as kidney disease, diabetes, or coronary/cardiovascular disease. We may also have to evaluate the efficacy of these medications in specific populations.
