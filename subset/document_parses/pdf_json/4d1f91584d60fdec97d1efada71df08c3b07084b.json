To gauge such response, we assessed service availability and Infection prevention and control (IPC) status in 110 hospitals situated across seven provinces. An electronic survey was sent out to the frontline clinicians working on those hospitals between 24 th March and 7 th April 2020; one response per hospital was analyzed. Hospitals were divided into small, medium, and large based on the total number of beds (small:\uf0a315; medium:16-50; large:>50), and further categorized into public, private, and mixed based on the ownership. Out of 110 hospitals, 81% (22/27) of small, 39% (11/28) of medium, and 33% (18/55) of large hospitals had not allocated isolation beds for COVID-19 suspects. All small, majority of medium (89%; 25/28), and 50% of large hospitals did not have a functional intensive care unit (ICU) at the time of study. Nasopharyngeal (NP)/throat swab kits were available in one-third (35/110), whereas viral transport media (VTM), portable fridge box, and refrigerator were available in one-fifth (20%) of hospitals. Only one hospital (large/tertiary) had a functional PCR machine. Except for General practitioners, other health cadres-crucial during pandemics, were low in number. On IPC measures, the supplies of simple face masks, gloves and hand sanitizers were adequate in the majority of hospitals, however, N95-respirators, Filter masks, and PPE-suits were grossly lacking. Government's COVID-19 support was unevenly distributed across provinces; health facilities in Province 2, Gandaki, and Province 5 received fewer resources than others. Our findings alert the Nepalese and other governments to act early and proactively during health emergencies and not wait until the disease disrupts their health systems. Other countries with similar economy levels may undertake similar surveys to measure and improve their pandemic response.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) on 30 th January 2020; on 11 th March, it was declared a global pandemic.(1) As of 12 th May 2020, the disease has spread to 215 countries, areas and territories, infecting four million people and causing over 279,000 deaths. (2) The increasing trend of new cases and deaths is further worsening COVID-19 situation globally. To minimize the burden, the global scientists have urged for pre-emptive measures to prevent COVID-19 outbreaks among the most vulnerable population of the world living in the vulnerable regions. (3) (4) In Nepal, the first case of COVID-19 disease was confirmed on 24 th January 2020. (5) The second case was detected on 23 rd March, after a two-month gap. It was that day the government decided to impose a nationwide lockdown as a measure to contain virus spread.(6) However, by the end of March, Nepal Public Health Laboratory (NPHL) located within the premises of Department of Health Sciences (DoHS), Teku was the only authorized lab for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests. Even with the gradual expansion of PCRbased testing outside Kathmandu, the government had tested less than 1,000 specimens, with detection of nine cases, by 7 th of April. The number of cases reached 217 on 12 th May 2020. (6) The medical fraternity of Nepal expressed their concerns regarding the government's public health strategies and hospital readiness in response to the potential outbreak of COVID-19 in the country. The clinicians and public health experts were particularly concerned about the government's weak preparation and unclear strategies around molecular testing, contact tracing, medical procurement, resource allocation, infection prevention measures, human resources and training, risk communication, and management of suspected or confirmed cases. (7) The nation's case finding strategy was heavily criticized by the experts calling it 'sheer undertesting' for the country with 29 million people. (8) The Government of Nepal designated 25 large (tertiary care) hospitals across all provinces as COVID-19 treatment centers, but there were no stringent guidelines for measuring pandemic readiness and response across the range of facilities.(6) With the decision of the High Level Coordination Committee (HLCC) for the Prevention and Control of COVID-19 (17 th March) to add 115 ICU and 1,000 isolation beds in the health facilities of Kathmandu, and set up a total of 120 ICU beds in other provinces, the overall status of pandemic preparedness and the capacity of national health systems were unknown. (9) The WHO released 'Hospital Readiness Checklist for COVID-19'-a useful tool for the assessment of pandemic response practices in the health facilities worldwide.(10) Similarly, the United Nations Nepal recently published 'Preparedness and Response Plan for Nepal (NPRP)' that highlighted key interventions that need to be implemented by the key players taking into account the projected caseload of 1,500 infected people and 150,000 collaterally affected population.(11)", "cite_spans": [{"start": 340, "end": 343, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 635, "end": 638, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 639, "end": 642, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 725, "end": 728, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2042, "end": 2045, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2647, "end": 2650, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "BACKGROUND"}, {"text": "The present study aimed to understand the ground status of COVID-19 services and infection prevention and how it varied across small, medium, and large hospitals.

Uneven distribution of health facilities across the provinces, especially abundant in Bagmati and the scarce in others, were accounted for.

Similar service constraints were reported by the National Disaster Risk Reduction Center. (13) The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) COVID-19 and Human Development Report 2020 also confirmed low preparedness to COVID-19 in Nepal, measured on the basis of national human development index (HDI), HDI inequalities, and health systems capacity. (14) By the time the survey was closed (7 th April 2020), i.e. a month after the WHO declared COVID-19 as global pandemic, a massive number of health facilities in many high-income countries had been affected by daily case surge with high rates of mortality. In contrast, Nepal had detected only nine cases with less than 1,000 PCR tests performed, and the government was stumbling through the second week of nationwide lockdown. Despite that given window of opportunity for Nepal in terms of pandemic preparedness, the majority of small and over one-third of medium and large hospitals had not allocated isolation beds for COVID-19 suspects. Even a number of large (tertiary care) facilities (50%) did not have a functional ICU unit; and among those with such availability, 71% had five or less functional beds that could be offered to COVID-19 patients if needed. With the decision HLCC decision (17 th March) to expand isolation and ICU beds throughout the country, a ray of hope spread amongst the public. (9) However, it is still unknown how the decision was implemented. Performance of the concerned ministries and health facilities while implementing decisions was often poor in Nepal. However, the concerned ministries and health facilities performed poorly in the implementation aspect. It should be noted that many countries utilized large halls, unused buildings, parks or open spaces to set up new isolation centers, but the scarcity of ICU beds was haunting everyone regardless of the country's economy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 108, "end": 141, "text": "13.20097675 doi: medRxiv preprint", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 407, "end": 411, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 669, "end": 673, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "(which was not certified by peer review)"}, {"text": "Prior to and in the first two weeks of lockdown, the majority of the hospitals were seeing a number of patients with respiratory (COVID-like) symptoms; some large hospitals reporting >200 COVID-19 suspected patients per day.

Four out of five hospitals did not have a supply of VTM and just one large hospital had a functional PCR machine throughout the country. The majority of small and medium hospitals did not have a molecular biologist (laboratory technologist) for collecting and processing specimens.

The highest number of facilities with Thermal gun was in Province 1 (68%) and Sudurpaschim (60%), the lowest in Gandaki (33%).

In this study, human resource for COVID-19 response was found inadequate across the range of facilities. Although a qualified General practitioner (MDGP) was providing service in more than half of medium and large hospitals, other health cadres crucial during pandemic responsephysicians and nurses trained in Infectious disease, microbiologists, public health specialists, and clinical epidemiologists, were on board in less than 20% of hospitals. According to the UNDP report, Nepal's health system capacity-measured on the basis of human resource for health, is very low with the availability of just three hospital beds, six physicians, and 27 nurses per 100,000 people.

Allocation of needful resources such as technical personnel, laboratory equipment, personal protective gears for health workers, health education (HEIC) materials, and emergency fund, which were the minimum expectations from the Department of Health Services (DoHS) at the time of health emergencies, was absent in all small hospitals, patchy in medium (district hospitals), and negligible in large hospitals. Provinces 2 and 5 were less supported than other provinces in terms of resource allocation, technical support, and optimization of COVID-19 case report and referral mechanisms. This deficit has been reflected by more rapid rise in cases in Province 2 (96 cases) and 5 (70 cases) than other provinces.(6) Much needed epidemic drill was also lacking throughout provinces, except Bagmati (six drills conducted) and Gandaki (five drills conducted). Other special services such as isolation beds for COVID-19 suspects, functional ICU beds for critically ill patients, sample collection and testing capacity, as well as, the level of infection prevention and control, was overall poor in all provinces. Our findings are supported by the field studies conducted by the National Disaster Risk Reduction Center. (13) (18) To mitigate pandemic-borne workload and managerial confusion within the Health Service divisions, the government could have leveraged full authority to the provinces and municipals, coupled with stringent action plans for high priority tasks-procurement of equipment and supplies, recruitment and training of human resource, expansion of laboratories and hospital units, contact tracing, and case reporting. On the other hand, the healthcare facilities, small to large and public or private, could have proactively activated their 'emergency preparedness plan' to ease the operational processes, way before the disease dismantled local health systems. Utilizing the relatively larger window of preparedness opportunity compared to hard-hit countries, these facilities could have adopted full preparation gears early on adhering to the relevant national guidelines and service standards, With the above findings, it is worthwhile to mention few limitations of this study. First, it was conducted using internet-based tool considering the government's strict orders for travel restriction and infection prevention. A field-based observational study would better reflect the scenario of services and IPC measures adopted by the hospitals. Second, the study did not .

As this pandemic teaches an important lesson for all governments-to act early and proactively during health emergencies and not wait until the disease disrupts health systems, our study findings could provide them further guidance to formulate emergency preparedness strategic plans and reduce the impact. Furthermore, to know the actual pandemic preparedness at each service level, and to understand the exact scenarios of case surge and patient management, surveillance and reporting, essential health services, and logistic supplies, there is an urgent need to conduct large-scale studies, coordinated either by government's epidemiology and research divisions or by non-government development and implementing partners. From global health point of view, other countries at similar levels of economic development could learn from our findings and conduct similar assessments in order to gauge their pandemic response. .
