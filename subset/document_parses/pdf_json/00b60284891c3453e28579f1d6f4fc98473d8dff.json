            "text": "Global excess mortality due to seasonal influenza-associated respiratory illnesses has been estimated to be 4-8.8 per 100,000 individuals and is a major issue in public health [1] . Designing efficient containment strategies for highly contagious diseases like influenza has become a subject of considerable interest [2, 3] . Previous reports have focused on national epidemics among countries [2, 4, 5] , but few reports have investigated the relationship between population flow and epidemics on a regional level. People move in small areas by various means, including walking, driving, or riding. Observing the subtle movements of large numbers of individuals has historically been limited by the availability of data. Therefore, it has remained difficult to observe population flow and epidemics in detail in local areas . We have long been interested in information from mobile phones and early monitoring of influenza infections and developed and tested self-reported influenza infection monitoring applications from mobile phones [6] . Mobile phones can provide us with useful 2 of 32 information for epidemiology. With the recent spread of mobile phones and the accumulation of location information, one can now trace the fine movements of many individuals. Hence, infectious disease epidemic tracking and forecasting have been attempted using data based on mobile phone Global Positioning System (GPS) location information [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . Research goals related to population flow and infectious disease transmission, such as tracking overall trends, identifying unknown individuals who may have been infected, and verifying models and concepts, differ. Varying effectiveness has been shown, but on the other hand, standard methods have not been established, and it is still necessary to use various data, try many methods, and accumulate knowledge.",

We obtained the prescription status of anti-influenza drugs from a dispensing pharmacy in the Kansai region of Japan, and the location data on the movement and location of people in the Kansai region from a telecommunications carrier, KDDI Co. (Tokyo, Japan) that already has a track record in using population flow [14, 15] . Disease mapping studies that monitor the spread of infectious diseases based on population flow have been conducted on a daily timescale for intercity locations [11, 16] , whereas mobile location data can be examined for specific areas and brief timeframes, thereby facilitating the observation of fluctuations on an hourly scale. Observing from a detailed perspective by increasing the information granularity may provide us with new insights. The present study aimed to estimate from a more detailed perspective influenza spread by observing the relationship between population flow during peak commuting times and prescribing anti-influenza prescriptions in the neighborhood using a specific method [17] .",

The data collected for analysis in this study were the number of prescriptions filled during the study period for the following anti-influenza drugs: oseltamivir phosphate, zanamivir hydrate, laninamivir octanoate hydrate, and baloxavir marboxil. These data were not collected specifically for analysis in the present study, and all data were retrospectively retrieved from an institutional database (I & H Corporation). The lag in prescription distributions during this time can be estimated by comparing each region, but each pharmacy has different business hours, so the effect of closed days on estimating influenza infection pathways needed to be considered.",

The number of prescriptions filled on Sunday is zero because the pharmacy is closed on that day, so if analyses are conducted on these data, the results would indicate that there are no individuals infected with influenza in this region on Sundays. However, it is more important to interpret this as individuals who wanted to go to a pharmacy on Sunday could not, and they thus chose to go to a hospital on Monday, thereby increasing the number of prescriptions on Monday. Therefore, a Kalman smoother was used on the anti-influenza drug prescription number data prior to analysis to smooth out the data.

A similarity between these pathways with high population flow is their traffic network development (primarily railroads). Furthermore, a characteristic point of population flow during the weekends is that it is directed towards Osaka. This is thought to be due to the fact that downtown areas and entertainment districts are concentrated within Osaka and that there are many people from outside the city who come for recreational purposes. Furthermore, there is relatively little population flow during 8-9 a.m. in cells 18 and 19. As can be seen in Figure 5 , there are few railroads through cells 18 and 19, and this is thought to indicate how the extent of traffic network development plays a role in population flows during commuting times.

Population flow from cell 8 was highest towards cell 3, followed by cell 14 (Figures A13-A20) . However, when comparing (3) and (6), it seemed that the distribution of the number of drug prescriptions in cell 8 had a higher correlation with cell 14 than cell 3. This was because the number of drug prescriptions was higher in cell 14 than in cell 3, and the pharmacy locations in cell 8 were closer to cell 14. For this reason, it can be seen in Figure 18 that there was virtually no lag in the correlation of the numbers of drug prescriptions between cells 8 and 14. Meanwhile, Figure 19 shows that there was a time lag of \u22127 for the correlation of the numbers of drug prescriptions between cells 3 and 8.",

We suspect that the influenza infection may not have spread to cell 6 due to the low population flow from cells 12 and 13 with high prescriptions. Another feature is the observation of transmission of infection by a small number of influenza patients. In cells 5 and 6, where high population flows were suspected, there was a high cross-correlation value of prescription numbers with a 7-day time-lag. We believe this phenomenon indicates the spread of influenza infection from cell 6 to cell 5. The observed 7-day time lag is longer than the time lag observed around cell 13 above. There may be a difference in the speed of spread between when there is and is not an influenza outbreak.",

We visualized the relationship between population flow and influenza infection epidemics on a single graph with the passage of time, and mathematically evaluated the relationship of the number of anti-influenza prescriptions between neighboring areas using the time lag by the cross-correlation function. The two types of information helped to estimate the direction and volume of population flow and the direction and rate of spread of influenza infection. Observations of influenza pandemics based on the population flow, between 10 km square areas, from 8:00 to 9:00, taking into account the day of the week, provide interesting implications. Our results support the notion that transportation networks such as trains play an important role in the spread of the influenza pandemic. This is because the time when the population flow was observed is the commuting time, and railroads are laid as a transportation network in areas with abundant flow of people. It was found that influenza did not spread to areas with undeveloped traffic networks, and the peak number of drug prescriptions arrived with a time lag of several days in areas where there was a high amount of area-to-area movement due to commuting. Our results may also provide additional suggestions. If there are few influenza patients, the rate of transmission may be slow even between areas with high population flow. Even between neighboring 10 km square areas, the spread of influenza infection is affected by distance and may take some time to spread.",

To predict influenza-endemic areas, data from internet social network services were commonly used in the previous studies. In the present study, the population flow information that is not directly related to influenza was analyzed, and it was compared to the influenza pandemic. There have recently been cases of using GPS to track several infectious diseases [9] [10] [11] 30, 31] . In these previous reports, authors made various attempts, such as using information from GPS to track the mobility of individual cases and assess trends in epidemics in the region. Information obtained from GPS can provide a new tool for combatting viral infectious diseases such as influenza, COVID-19, and HIV. The unique feature of the present study was to predict the population flow during commuting time and mathematically evaluate the number of anti-influenza prescriptions between relatively small neighboring areas with a cross-correlation function. An examination of the flow of people focused on a limited time period in a particular neighborhood showed that commuter trains may play an important role in the spread of influenza infection. The time lag given by the cross-correlation function of anti-influenza prescriptions in neighboring areas may provide information about the direction of spread of influenza infection. We believe that such information is important for the prevention and prediction of influenza pandemics in neighboring areas.",
