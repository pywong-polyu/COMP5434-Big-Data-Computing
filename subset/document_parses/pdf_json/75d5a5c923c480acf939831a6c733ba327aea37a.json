Studies using digital data sources show that the mobility of individuals was effectively reduced in multiple countries. However, it remains unclear whether these reductions caused deeper structural changes in mobility networks and how such changes may affect dynamic processes on the network. Here we use movement data of mobile phone users to show that mobility in Germany has not only been reduced considerably: Lockdown measures caused substantial and long-lasting structural changes in the mobility network. We find that long-distance travel was reduced disproportionately strongly. The trimming of long-range network connectivity leads to a more local, clustered network and a moderation of the \"small-world\" effect. We demonstrate that these structural changes have a considerable effect on epidemic spreading processes by \"flattening\" the epidemic curve and delaying the spread to geographically distant regions.",

We analyze movements recorded from mobile phones of 43.6 million individuals in Germany. Beyond a general reduction in mobility, we find considerable structural changes in the mobility network. Due to the reduction of long-distance travel, the network becomes more local and lattice-like. Most importantly, we find a changed scaling relation between path lengths and geographic distance: During lockdown, the effective distance (and arrival time in spreading processes) to a destination continually grows with geographic distance. This shows a marked reduction of the \"small-world\" characteristic, where geographic distance is usually of lesser importance in determining path lengths (22, 23) . Using simulations of a commuter-based susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, we demonstrate that these changes have considerable practical implications as they suppress (or \"flatten\") the curve of an epidemic remarkably and delay the disease's arrival between distant regions.",

The data counts the number of trips, where a trip is defined as a single mobile phone switching cell towers at least once, between two resting phases of at least 15 min (Fig. 1D) . A resting phase is defined as a mobile phone not switching its connected cell tower. These trips are aggregated over the course of a day to build the daily flow matrix F(t). The element Fji (t) quantifies the total number of trips from location i to location j on a given day t. Locations are the m = 401 counties of Germany. Note that flows within counties Fii (t) are included.

To apply these measures more efficiently in the future, it is important to understand their effects in detail. In this study, we use mobile phone data to uncover profound structural changes in mobility in Germany during the pandemic. We find that a strong reduction of long-distance travel rendered mobility to be more local, such that distant parts of the country became less connected. We demonstrate that due to this loss of connectivity, infectious diseases can be slowed down in their spatial spread. Our study provides important insights into the complex effects of mobility restrictions for policymakers and future research. To analyze general changes in mobility during the COVID-19 pandemic, we focus on the daily mobility change \u2206n(t), which is the relative difference in the total number of trips N (t) = m i,j =1 Fji (t) compared to the baseline number of trips, i.e., during a period of \"normal\" mobility. Here, we use March 2019 as this baseline period and compare the mobility on each date t from 2020 to the average mobility on the corresponding weekday in March 2019 (Materials and Methods).",

The largest reduction occurred in mid-March, when the vast majority of mobilityreducing interventions took effect (information on government policies is taken from the ACAPS dataset (6); SI Appendix). Over the course of 3 wk, mobility dropped to \u221240% below baseline on March 27 in the 7-d moving average. The total number of daily recorded trips decreased from 176 million to 107 million trips (from 3.8 to 2.3 daily trips per user). The decline was fol-lowed by an immediate rebound at the beginning of April, even though mobility-restricting regulations remained in effect during this period. In the following months, mobility increased slowly, reaching its prelockdown levels in early June. Interestingly, the increase in mobility took place in small bursts followed by short periods of stagnation. These bursts started at around the same time that mobility-restricting policies were lifted, hinting at a causal relationship.",

We observed a greater mobility reduction in western and southern states (such as Bavaria), which were more substantially affected by the pandemic, compared to the eastern states of Germany (for example, in Saxony-Anhalt) (25) . This difference can partially be explained by more severe mobility restrictions in some western states. For instance, Bavaria passed stricter measures on May 20, resulting in a higher reduction in mobility in calendar week 13. Still, most policies were uniform across Germany and were implemented in a similar manner on a federal level. Therefore, differences in policies can deliver only a partial explanation for regional heterogeneities. Furthermore, we found systematic dependencies on demographic factors. Mobility is reduced more in large cities compared to less densely populated areas. In addition, several border regions particularly associated with cross-border traffic exhibit a higher than average mobility reduction, although the border as a whole does not deviate markedly from the average. Distance Dependence of Mobility Reduction. The observed general reduction in mobility begs the question of how mobility has changed and what types of trips were reduced.

The shortest path length can be related to time scales for search or spreading processes, i.e., the time it takes to reach one location starting at another. The clustering coefficient quantifies the magnitude of the average flow between triplets of neighboring locations-a large value indicates that two neighbors of a location are likely to have large flows between them, too. Numerous systems are associated with high clustering while having small shortest paths (typically mean shortest paths scale logarithmically with systems size), which is referred to as the small-world property. This property typically facilitates the spread of epidemics (26, 27) .

As a consequence of these structural changes, both the average shortest path length L(T ) and average clustering coefficient C (T ) increase substantially (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, we observe a striking difference in expected path length as a function of geographic distance (Fig. 4C ). In the prelockdown network, the expected shortest path length L d initially increases with geographical distance d , but eventually levels out at an almost constant level for d 550 km, i.e., is independent of geographic distance. This is a well-known phenomenon of spatial small-world networks, where it has been shown that shortest path lengths typically scale as L \u221d r with Euclidian distance r up to a critical distance rc, followed by an independence regime, L \u2248 const. for r > rc (29) . A similar relation has been found in empirical human mobility networks such as air traffic networks (23) . In such networks, geographic distance is an unreliable predictor for the effective arrival time because larger geographical distances can quickly be overcome by traveling along links connecting distant places. However, in the lockdown network, we observe a continued, almost linear dependence of the shortest path length on geographical distance, which is a typical property of lattices (28) . Because long-distance links are missing or weak, and travel predominantly occurs along short-distance connections, geographical distance dominates effective travel distance or travel duration. We therefore conclude that the lockdown network is more lattice-like, with predominantly local connections and fewer connections between remote locations, reflecting a reduction of the system's small-world property. As indicated above, this has important implications for dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading, which we discuss in the next section.",

Contacts between susceptibles and infecteds may lead to the infection of the susceptible individual and infected individuals can spontaneously be removed from the transmission process by medical/nonmedical interventions, death, or immunization. In metapopulation models, infecteds based in one location can cause infections in other locations with a rate proportional to the daily flow between locations. Implicitly it is assumed that individuals travel back and forth and transport the infection between areas.

The changed scaling behavior cannot be explained by the lower total amount of trips (rescaled network). mobility, the arrival times exhibit only a slow increase with geographic distance.

The reduction in mobility can be divided into a swift decrease, early in the lockdown phase, followed by a slow recovery. The initial rebound occurred in late March although official policies remained unchanged. This could be indicative of individuals taking up nonessential trips again despite lockdown policies.

This result emphasizes our argument that the changes in the mobility network shown in this study have direct and nontrivial consequences on dynamic processes such as epidemic spreading. Our findings also suggest that targeted mobility restrictions may be used to effectively mitigate the spread of epidemics.

To measure path lengths in the network, we consider two counties to be \"close\" to each other when they are connected by a large flow value and define the distance of each link as the inverse weight along the edge ji = 1/w ji . Using this distance metric we calculate the shortest path length L ji between each pair of source node i and target node j using Dijkstra's algorithm (33) . We calculate the weekly average path length L(T) = (m(m \u2212 1)) \u22121 m i,j=1 L ji (T) and the average weighted and directed clustering coefficient C(T) = m \u22121 m i=1 C i (T) over all nodes for the weekly networks G T (as defined in ref. 34 ). Because the above definition of distance is sensitive to changes in the total flow of the network, we discuss a variety of other distance scales in SI Appendix, yielding similar results (SI Appendix, sections 3B and 3C). Additionally, we show that increasing the observation threshold w c does not substantially change the results, indicating that the original threshold of the data was chosen small enough to not have an impact on our conclusions. SIR Metapopulation Model. We use a modified version of the model proposed in ref. 32 where susceptible S, infected I, and recovered individuals R are associated to be part of commuter compartments X ji (with X \u2208 {S, I, R}) when they live in location i and work in location j. The compartments are coupled by shared work and home locations, respectively, and commuter-compartment population sizes N pop ji = S ji + I ji + R ji are assumed to be proportional to the edge-specific outflux ratio of location i as N pop ji = N pop i F ji / k F ki . Full details are given in SI Appendix, section 4. As stated in the main text, we incorporate two different variations of lockdown mechanisms into the model, to account for different interpretations of the influence of mobility reduction on the average number of contacts. In the distancing scenario, we assume that a mobility reduction by a factor \u03ba i in a location i leads to a linear reduction in the transmission rate \u03b2 i throughout the epidemic; i.e., \u03b2 i = \u03ba i \u00d7 \u03b2. The assumption here is that the reduced mobility uniformly translates into reduced contacts between individuals. In the other, stricter scenario of isolation, we instead assume that the reduced mobility means that individuals stop their commuting and are effectively removed from the system. We implement this by assuming that initially, a fraction 1 \u2212 \u03ba i is removed from the transmission process such that S ji (t = 0) = \u03ba i S ji (t = 0) and R ji (t = 0) = (1 \u2212 \u03ba i )S ji (t = 0). Both scenarios lead to a reduction of the basic reproduction number that is proportional to a reduction of mobility. In SI Appendix, section 5, we argue that such a linear relationship corresponds to an upper bound of transmissibility reduction induced by mobility reduction.",

(B) Distribution of node degrees k. The average node degree k and network density \u03c1 are lower during lockdown ( k = 148, \u03c1 = 32.6%) than in the prelockdown network ( k = 219, \u03c1 = 49.8%). These differences are only partially explained by a uniform, global reduction of trips (which causes trips to fall below the anonymization threshold w c = 5), as demonstrated by comparison to the rescaled prelockdown network G 10 * (T = 13) which is structurally similar to network G 10 but has the same number of total trips as G 13 (Materials and Methods).

Radial distance is scaled in multiples of the average shortest path length L(T 0 ) in week T 0 = 10. Gray circles mark the largest shortest path length in week 10. Further plots for Berlin and for other sources (which we find to exhibit qualitatively similar changes) are provided in SI Appendix, section 3D.

Mobility decreases drastically in mid-March, coincident with restricting measure implementations (red bars), followed by a gradual increase in mobility concurrent with the lifting of restricting policies (teal bars). Bar width indicates the number of policies issued or lifted on that date, respectively. (B) The change in mobility is spatially heterogeneous. Mobility is reduced more in large cities (shown here for the 20 largest cities) and states that implemented more severe restrictions (such as Bavaria). (C) Mobility change in German counties for the 3 wk with most substantial global change. The mobility change \u2206n (i) (t) represents the number of trips that originate in county i (Materials and Methods). (D) Illustration of how mobility is recorded. A trip is counted when a user switches to one or multiple new cell towers, until the user becomes stationary again (no further switch for approximately 15 min). Trips can be within the same county (teal, solid line) or between different counties (red, dotted-dashed line). Movements without changing cell towers are not recorded (gray, dotted line).",
