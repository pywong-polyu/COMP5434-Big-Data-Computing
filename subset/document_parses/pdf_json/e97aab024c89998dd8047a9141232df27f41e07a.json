            "text": "The global coronavirus outbreak has prompted scientists to discover a cure for the disease. So far, phosphorus-based drugs have been proposed. These drugs have good inhibitory activity against the main protease (Mpro). Hence, in order to introduce a group of inhibitors the coronavirus, 51 compounds containing different mono, bis, and tetra phosphonates as Remdesivir derivatives, 32 of which are new, were synthesized and characterized by 31 P, 13 C, and 1 H NMR and IR spectroscopy. Their biological activities were also investigated by Molecular Docking, QSAR, and Pharmacophore. Van der Waals, hydrogen bonding, and hydrophobic interactions were studied for all compounds as well as binding energy (\u25b3G, Kcal/mole) and the inhibitory constant Ki (\u03bcM) obtained by Molecular Docking. The results showed that the topology of the ligands and the change of the different groups attached to them can be effective in the placement position in the active site of the enzyme (Glu 166 and Gln 189). And bisphosphonates have a high interaction tendency with Mpro COVID-19. Compound L24 was identified as the best inhibitor with the -6.38 kcal/mol binding energy. The quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) findings demonstrated that the polarity and topology of molecules in all phosphonate derivatives were important parameters affecting the effecting on the binding energy and inhibitory ability of compounds. The DFT and pharmacophore results are in good accordance with those of QSAR and molecular docking. This study can be helpful to gain a better understanding of the interactions between the Mpro of virus and its inhibitors in order to attain drugs with more effect on coronavirus (COVID-19).",

Genetic Algorithms have been employed in recent years as a powerful tool to optimize many problems in drug design [33, 37, 38] . This approach allows the selection of the models with the following characteristics: high correlation coefficient R, low standard deviation S, and the least number of descriptors involved [39] . In order to evaluate the generated models, leave-one-out cross-validation is used. In this algorithm, one compound is left in each step as a prediction set, and the model is developed using the remaining molecules as the training set [40] . For further exhaustive testing of the prediction power of the model, in addition to LOO-CV, the leave-multiple-out cross-validation (LMO-CV) algorithm was also carried out. Then the \u0394G of this group was predicted by the model developed by using the remaining observations as the training set [40] .",

Furthermore, the molecular docking considers the effect of various factors on the ligand ranging from ring size to aliphatic chain length to the presence of different atoms, and to electronegative and electropositive groups when interacting with the protein. In this work, the interactions between the different phosphonate compounds and the X-ray crystal structure of COVID-19 (PDB ID: 6LU7) were studied by molecular docking. The aim of this study is to investigate the inhibitory potency of a group of phosphonate derivatives against the coronavirus and to evaluate the most effective electronic and structural factors in this process. Three series of compounds were classified as mono, bis, and tetra phosphonates, respectively. The binding energies were measured for the mono and bisphosphonates in the range of -3.26 to -6.38 kcal/mol, Well-known antiviral drugs (Table 4) were compared to the synthesized compounds, in terms of Docking parameters, Remdesivir (-6.75 kcal/mol), Adefovir (-4.18 kcal/mol), Tenofovir (-4.97 kcal/mol), and Foscarnet (-3.13 kcal/mol). Therefore, it can be anticipated that mono and bisphosphonates could be effective against COVID-19 as possible medicinal agents.",

The \u03c0-Sulfur and \u03c0-alkyl interactions were observed between the phenyl ring of L12 with the sulfur atom of Met 165 and the alkyl group of Pro 168 at a distance 5.40 A\u00b0 and 5.47 A\u00b0, respectively (Fig.   1C ). (Table. 2). The plausible binding mode of L24 and the active site of 6LU7 is displayed in Fig. 2A . As can be seen, acidic hydrogens were involved in the formation of hydrogen bonds with Asn142, Phe140, Gln192, Arg188, and Thr190 residues from the active site of the Mpro, respectively. The hydrophobic interactions were shown in red color between residues and different sections of the compound L12 (Fig. 2B) . Furthermore, the phenyl ring was connected to Met165 via \u03c0-Alkyl bonds with distance 5.34 A\u00b0. These interactions have led to more stability of the target complex (Fig. 2C ) the best interactions with protein 6LU7 in tetraphosphonates (Fig. 3A) . The hydrophobic residues interactions of 6LU7 with L44 were shown by the red dashed line (Fig. 3B, 3C) . Several hydrogen bonds are seen between the hydrogen of O-H group in L44 with the oxygen of C=O group in Asn142, Glu166, the nitrogen of N-H in Glu166, and Asn142 (Fig. 3B) . Also, \u03c0-sulfur and \u03c0cation stacking interactions have been respectively observed between the phenyl ring of L44 with the sulfur atom of Cys 145 and the NH 3 + of residue His 163 at a distance 4.69 A\u00b0 and 5.57 A\u00b0 (Fig. 3C) . constant (Ki) showed that the bisphosphonates had a higher inhibitory effect and lower binding energy than those of other derivatives ( Figure 4A ), And L24 can be considered as the most active compound.",

The common pharmacophores from the reference molecule (Tenofovir) showed nine hydrogen bond acceptors (Yellow), five hydrophobic groups (Green), and two aromatic rings (Purple) ( Figure 8A ). The second reference molecule (Adefovir) showed seven hydrogen bond acceptors, two hydrophobic groups, and two aromatic rings ( Figure 8B) , and L12 showed three hydrogen-bond acceptors, two hydrophobic groups, two aromatic rings, and one negative ion (Red) (Figure 8C ), as well as L24, displayed eight hydrogen bond acceptor, one hydrophobic group, and two negative ions ( Figure   8d ). Hydrogen bond acceptors, hydrophobic groups, and negative ions were common pharmacophores in all structures of phosphonates that are helpful for binding with receptors.",

The topology of the ligands and the change of the different groups attached to them can be effective in the placement position in the active site of the enzyme (Glu 166 and Gln 189).Compound L24 was identified as the best inhibitor with the -6.38 kcal/mol binding energy. In general, bisphosphonate had a higher inhibitory effect and lower binding energy than other phosphonates. QSAR calculation results using the Genetic Algorithm -Stepwise multiple linear regression (GA-SW-MLR) method for mono, bis, tetra phosphonate reveal that the difference between descriptors and Inhibition mechanism in QSAR models can explain the reasons for the diverse behavior of inhibitors. The electronic descriptor in the QSAR model of the mono phosphonate, structural descriptors in the QSAR model of the tetra phosphonate, and both structural and electron parameters in the QSAR model of bisphosphonate were effective on binding energy. Molecule topology, chemical potential, and the number of hydrogen bond acceptors were common descriptors between QSAR models mono, bis, and all phosphonate derivatives. The DFT and pharmacophore were used to verify docking and QSAR.",
