However, objective clinical responses have only been achieved in a minority of patients. Additionally, generation of GMP-compliant DCs requires time-and labor-intensive cell differentiation. In contrast, Blood DCs (BDCs) require only minimal ex vivo handling, as differentiation occurs in vivo resulting in potentially better functional capacities and survival. We aimed to identify a protocol for optimal in vitro activation of BDCs including the three subsets pDCs, cDC1s, and cDC2s. We evaluated several TLR ligand combinations and demonstrated that polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid [poly(I:C)] and R848, ligands for TLR3 and TLR7/8, respectively, constituted the optimal combination for inducing a positive co-stimulatory profile in all BDC subsets. In addition, TLR3 and TLR7/8 activation led to high secretion of IFN-\u03b1 and IL-12p70. Simultaneous as opposed to separate tailored activation of pDCs and cDCs increased immunostimulatory capacities, suggesting that BDC subsets engage in synergistic cross-talk during activation. Stimulation of BDCs with this protocol resulted in enhanced migration, high NK-cell activation, and potent antigen-specific T-cell induction. We conclude that simultaneous activation of all BDC subsets with a combination of R848 + poly(I:C) generates highly immunostimulatory DCs. These results support further investigation and clinical testing, as standalone or in conjunction with other immunotherapeutic strategies including adoptive T-cell transfer and checkpoint inhibition.",

These cytokines modulate adaptive and innate immunity by inducing, for example, NK-cell activation, B-cell differentiation, and Th1 polarization [14] . In contrast, cDC2s express TLRs that recognize lipopolysaccharides (TLR4), flagellin (TLR5), and the lipoproteins of bacteria and fungi (TLR2 and TLR6). They also express TLR8 and TLR9 that are activated by singlestranded RNA and DNA, respectively. Thus, different CD4 + T helper subsets and CD8 + T cells are induced depending on the circumstances [15] . cDC1s represent a rare BDC subset that expresses, among others, TLR3 that is activated by viral double-stranded RNAs leading to secretion of interleukin (IL) 12 [16] . They also express TLR8, which is closely related to TLR7, and the endocytic receptor CLEC9A that promotes antigen cross-presentation of intracellular pathogens or necrotic cells on MHC class I, thereby activating cytotoxic CD8 + T cells [17] . cDC1s have therefore attracted much interest in the context of cancer immunotherapy [18] .",

Tickborne encephalitis vaccine-activated pDCs demonstrated a mature phenotype and produced large amounts of type I IFNs in melanoma patients, inducing tumor-specific immune responses [19] ; this is in contrast to antigen-loaded, but nonactivated cDC2s administered to prostate cancer patients [20] . In a clinical trial of GM-CSF-activated cDC2s, three of 14 metastatic melanoma patients exhibited functional tumor-specific T cells.

This is consistent with results from a humanized mouse model [29] . Unexpectedly, the introduction of a resting step before TLR activation of BDCs strongly increased IFN-\u03b1 secretion, whereas IL-12 was reduced. Spontaneous apoptosis of cDCs during ex vivo handling might explain this observation, whereas cultivation with IL-3 during the resting step might have promoted survival of pDCs. Conversely, preincubation with IL-3 for longer periods was reported to decrease the IFN-\u03b1 secretion capacity of pDCs [31] , however, as appropriate controls were missing in that study, spontaneous apoptosis might have been at play. Furthermore, we observed that reducing the time span of BDC activation and introducing the resting step resulted in reduced T-cell responses compared to BDC activation for 20 h immediately after their isolation.",

The role assigned to pDCs in shaping the immune response in oncological malignancies remains controversial, with contradicting correlations between pDC infiltration and disease prognosis [32, 33] . Recently, the results of a clinical trial of protamine-RNA-activated pDCs, cDCs, or a combination of pDCs and cDCs in prostate cancer were reported. In all three treatment arms, antigen-specific T-cell responses were induced and correlated with radiographic progressionfree survival, but no significant differences were observed [34] . Interestingly, when the authors used protamine-RNA for DC activation, cDCs did not secrete IL-12, but pDCs did, albeit at a low level. This might have been caused by a rare contaminating cDC population sharing common pDC markers [35] , as the purity of the pDC vaccine was only modest. However, in our study, BDCs elicited higher immunostimulatory capacities than a combination of pDCs and cDCs activated with tailored protocols, underlining the rationale for activating all BDC subsets simultaneously.",

WT1 is a universal tumor target antigen due to its expression pattern in multiple different cancer entities, thus having great potential for developing immunotherapies [36] . However, inducing sufficient immune responses is a major challenge owing to the low immunogenicity of nonmutated tumor antigens and clonal deletion of self-reactive T cells [37] . R848 + poly(I:C)activated BDCs were able to expand WT1-specific T cells, providing a rationale for their further development as an immunotherapeutic tool.
