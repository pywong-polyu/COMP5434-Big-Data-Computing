However, the design and implementation of health technological solutions often disregard the elderly physiological and psychological abilities, leading to low adoption of these technologies. We evaluate the usability of a remote patient monitoring solution, VITASENIOR-MT, which is based on the interaction with a television set. Twenty senior participants (over 64 years) and a control group of 20 participants underwent systematic tests with the health platform and assessed its usability through several questionnaires. Elderly participants scored high on the usability of the platform, very close to the evaluation of the control group. Sensory, motor and cognitive limitations were the issues that most contributed to the difference in usability assessment between the elderly group and the control group. The solution showed high usability and acceptance regardless of age, digital literacy, education and impairments (sensory, motor and cognitive), which shows its effective viability for use and implementation as a consumer product in the senior market.",

It is estimated that the old age dependency ratio will result in a decrease from 3.1 workers/1 pensioner to 2 workers/1 pensioner in 2070 [1] . This demographic scenario is creating a significant demand in healthcare and social systems, which need to be efficient, sustainable and as close as possible to the population. In this scenario, the elderly appear as one of the most vulnerable groups because of the increased comorbidity, and also due to difficulties in accessing informal and institutional care, usually associated with a fragile socioeconomic condition [2] . In most countries, cardiovascular and oncological diseases constitute the most significant health burden in older adults, and multimorbidity is also common, leading to complex polimedication regimens.",

Considering the latter, several remote patient monitoring (RPM) solutions to avoid the institutionalization and to promote independent living have been developed and tested. The Covid-19 pandemic has also highlighted the importance of RPM and how it can be used to safely provide care. These technologies consist mainly of safety and security monitoring of health, vital signs and environmental parameters [3] . However, most studies evaluating these solutions highlight the need for technological solutions amenable to tailored configurations that meet individual needs (see survey in [4] ). In particular, the ageing population has unique needs resulting from the progressive deterioration of physiological and psychological This work has been financially supported by the Portuguese foundation for science and technology (FCT) and European funds through Project VITASENIOR-MT with grant CENTRO-01-0145-FEDER-023659. abilities, which leads to low adoption of health technologies when the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of these users are disregarded in the design and development of products [5, 6] . In terms of human-computer interaction, many technological, social and cultural factors have also been shown to limit the deployment of healthcare technologies, as surveyed in [7] .",

However, commercial services for remote monitoring of biometric parameters for the elderly population are still incipient, in part due to the low usability of current systems, given the particular needs and skills of the elderly. Remote monitoring can play an important role in supporting medical diagnosis, surveillance of patients in home hospitalization during subacute periods [11] or for continuous monitoring of people with chronic diseases, complementing patients' self-management at home [12] , for example, through monitoring of weight, heart rate, oxygen saturation, blood pressure and glycaemia [13] . Yet, services to transfer these data to remote systems mostly depend on the use of smartphone or tablet applications (mHealth scenarios) [14] , which represents a barrier to their use by the majority of older adults [15] . The digital literacy of the elderly is very dependent on their social, cultural and economic condition, but in general is low [5, 16] . Seniors are quite resistant to new technologies or have difficulty in using them due to vision, hearing, sensory, dexterity and cognition impairments [15, [17] [18] [19] . To overcome these difficulties, and to guarantee the success of a given application, the interaction models and technologies to be considered must be adapted to this reality, aiming at simpler, functional and useful approaches [20] . In this perspective, the use of TV sets has been proposed as an easy-to-use technological solution that offers some advantageous features and may increase technology acceptance. Namely, it has a familiar interface, and therefore, the elderly are used to control their basic functions, the screen is large enough to show large text and icons, it is very easy to adjust the audio level, and finally, almost everyone has one, thus reducing the additional charge [6, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] ].",

            "text": "Several proof-of-concept TV-based systems have been proposed in remote biometric monitoring contexts. With the development of digital television, some first experiments soon emerged to integrate TV-based interactive services. Gork et al. [27] proposed one of the first related works, an interactive digital television framework considering usability concerns for elderly users. The system provided a customized user interface that adapted to the needs of each user group. Videoconference and informational services were tested with 83 users with promising results. In [28] , a digital video broadcasting terrestrial multimedia home platform (DVBT-MHP) connected to the TV was used for health monitoring (level of glucose in the blood, oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate and body weight). This work has shown the potential of TV-based remote monitoring including user authentication and data security issues. However, it was highly dependent on digital terrestrial television infrastructure, which limits its deployment. [29] has been tested by a group of 50 older adults to assess seniors' acceptance of a TV-based solution used for medical reminders (appointments and medication intake). The HEREiAM platform proposed in [24] used an Androidbased system supported by a private cloud system and was designed to be accessible both via TV and portable devices, which is an important asset of the system. The platform connects medical devices via Bluetooth and includes some other useful services such as the weather forecast or services designed to support the elderly living alone. The platform has been tested at different times by a group of 19 older adults, although with a limited number of medical devices (blood pressure and body weight). TV-based systems were also proposed in different contexts. For example, in [21] a combined TV-computer solution was proposed to explore the idea of a \"hidden\" computer behind the TV console providing the main functionalities of a computer. The system was tested by a group of 14 seniors. In [26] , an interactive platform, running on an Android STB, was developed and tested by 8 participants over 60 years old to promote the info-inclusion in the elderly population, providing informative contents about useful services, previously obtained via focus groups. Its current application is somehow limited since it is based only on open streaming TV channels. Commercial solutions are already available to offer social interaction, like photo sharing and videoconferencing, social activities, teleconsultation and health reminders [30, 31] .",

We report the experimental evaluation of the solution by end-users, considering its usefulness, satisfaction, ease of use and ease of learning. The solution was designed and validated following a user-centred design (UCD) perspective along 3 phases. The first phase was used to collect users' feedback about the system and to adjust it accordingly (this period was longitudinal to the project development). In the second phase, the system was systematically assessed by a group of 20 seniors from elderly care centres and a control group of 20 people outside those centres, who answered to questionnaires assessing usefulness, satisfaction, ease of use and ease of learning. Then, three participants, selected from the senior group, used the home-care platform for two months. The home-care platforms were installed in 2 different senior centres (nursing homes), where experimental tests were conducted with the elderly and health professionals (doctors and nurses of the institutions). The main contribution of the paper is to set forth the viability of the interactive telehealth solution via TV for the elderly population. The solution showed a high usability regardless of age, digital literacy, education and impairments (sensory, motor and cognitive), which shows its effective potential for use and implementation in the senior market.",

            "text": "The core of the telehealth home-care platform is based on a Raspberry Pi 3 (RPi3) micro-computer integrated into a hub-box called VITABOX, which is responsible for interacting with a TV, Bluetooth medical devices, IEEE 802.15.4 WSN, and the cloud infrastructure. The RPi3 has all the required communication modules, namely Bluetooth, WLAN IEEE 802.11, HDMI-CEC (consumer electronic control) and USB to connect to the IEEE 802.15.4 WSN border router (inside VITABOX). Both VITABOX and the set-top box receiver are connected to the TV set through 2 HDMI ports, making the telehealth approach independent of the television service provider. Toggling between these two modes occurs either manually, at the user's own initiative, using the TV's remote control, or automatically, when alarm situations are triggered by abnormal values of environmental sensors. The interaction of the direct end-user with the telehealth system is done through the TV's remote control. This feature was a key design and implementation requirement of the VITASEN-IOR-MT system, which aims to be familiar, functional, easy to use and requiring the minimum number of steps as possible to perform the telehealth tasks. The end-user accesses all features of the home-care platform through 7 keys of the remote, namely, \"OK\", \"L/R/U/D Arrows\", \"Back\" and \"1\", as depicted in Fig. 2 . The \"1\" key is used to toggle between TV and telehealth modes, by user's own initiative. If the user receives a notification at the lower right corner of the TV while watching TV (see Fig. 1 ), the TV also toggles to telehealth mode by pressing the key \"OK\" and shows the notification screen. In telehealth mode, the user has an initial welcome screen with information regarding the day, date and time, weather information and a list of the open pharmacies nearby. From the sidebar menu, the user can access the main options such as \"Exams\", \"Exam history\" and \"Environmental history\" using the remote's arrow keys (see demo videos 1 ). After choosing the desired option, the user selects at the top of the screen the tab associated with his/her profile, since more than one user can be registered in the same platform (e.g. a couple). By selecting the \"Exams\" sidebar option, a set of medical devices associated with the user's profile is exhibited. Currently, the following medical devices are available: blood pressure meter, glucometer, oximeter and weight scale (heart rate is included in the blood-pressure meter and the oximeter). Each medical device is selected by pressing the remote's \"OK\" key. The \"instructions of use\" are image-and text-based, accompanied by audiodescription. Each medical device has its own way of operation, like any other regular device. For example, a blood pressure measurement requires pressing the start button, whereas for the weight scale the user only needs to step on the scale. The communication between VITABOX and the device occurs in a transparent way, without any intervention from the user. At the end of the measurement, the data are transferred to the VITABOX and communicated to the user in a visual and auditory way. Visual layout, audio texts and interaction procedures were all adjusted based on the feedback of end-users and professional and informal caregivers, during the first phase of the usability tests in a UCD perspective, as described in sect. 3. Environmental data (CO, CO2, temperature and humidity) are collected from the WSN transparently and made available for visualization on the TV. Implementation details can be found in [32] .",

All VITASENIOR-MT users with an account can interact with the web portal, namely doctors, formal caregivers (nurses, geriatric nursing assistants) and informal caregivers (family members) and direct end-users. On the other hand, the system was built ensuring the installation of the home platform's kit was as plug and play as possible (that includes the VITABOX, medical devices, and environmental sensors). This is done by pre-registering all equipment, still inactive, which will be available for installation. The user responsible for the VITABOX (e.g. a relative of the end-user, hereinafter referred to as sponsor) is able to acquire and associate additional equipment to his/her VITABOX (e.g. an extra environmental sensor), as well as to define the VITABOX location used for geo-tracking in case of alarm events or to locate nearby pharmacies. The sponsor is responsible for registering patients associated with the VITABOX, define other users as caregivers, associate doctors to patients and define which devices (medical and environmental) will be used by each patient, allowing the system to scale not only in the home environment, but also in nursing homes or hospitals.",

First, a customized evaluation questionnaire was applied to evaluate the specificities of the homecare platform, regarding its different components (measurements with different medical devices, access to data history, etc). This questionnaire comprised 29 questions to evaluate the TV interaction quality, concerning ease of access, information understanding, provision and usefulness, rated from 1 to 5 (5-point Likert scale), where 1 is very bad and 5 is very good (this questionnaire is available in supplementary material). We also used a quantitative metric that consisted of measuring the time to perform the tasks. Additionally, the qualitative-validated questionnaire USE [34] was also adopted, generally assessing the subjective usability in 4 dimensions, namely Usefulness, Satisfaction, Ease of use and Ease of learning which comprises 30 items scored from 1 to 7 (1-strongly disagree and 7-strongly agree, all positive statements), though 3 statements were discarded as they did not apply. In comparison with the SUS (System Usability Scale) questionnaire, which is more commonly used, the USE questionnaire has the advantage of assessing the 4 dimensions separately, while SUS provides a single dimension score. Nevertheless, SUS and USE have shown to strongly correlate [35] .",

A significant amount of improvements has been achieved from perceived issues in user-system interaction, and from the suggestions provided by seniors, caregivers and health professionals, all contributing to a better overall solution. We mention just a few, for example, for the home-care platform: adjustment the reaction time of the TV remote control by software (seniors, in general, press the keys of the remote for a long time, leading to uncontrolled selections), highlight of the \"help pictures and text\" at the exact moment of audio description, adaptation of the help information content, change of items' colours and sizes, highlight of the 7 keys on the remote with a printed cover, and for the web portal, healthcare professionals proposed, for example: a redirect to a \"notification page\" as soon as they login (to get an immediate picture of abnormal situations), changes in layout and navigation between pages, definition of clinical profiles for different times of the day (morning and afternoon) to set different clinical thresholds, a more flexible way to schedule examinations and a direct communication channel with their patients. Figures 3 and 4 show a summary of the scores obtained from the customized questionnaire assessing the \"TV-based home-care platform\", by the senior centre group (SG) and the control group (CG). Figure 3 reflects the global assessment regarding the following questions: Q1-Access to Figure 4 shows the evaluation results for TASK 2 (questions W1-Usefulness, W2-Easiness, W3-Duration) and TASK 5 (questions BP1-Usefulness, BP2-Easiness, BP3-Duration), specifically assessing the execution of physical examinations (W-weight and BP-blood pressure). Questions G1-User selection, G2-Exam and history access tabs and G3-Audio-description assess users' satisfaction while performing TASKS 2,3,4,5. Both groups have considered that user selection is easy, presenting a very small score difference between groups, 4.4 and 4.6, respectively, for SG and CG. The CG scored higher the access to Exam and history tabs, and audio-description than the SG. Special emphasis is given to audio-description, with a difference of 0.84 between the 2 groups. Both groups expressed blood pressure measurement as more useful than weight measurement. On the other hand, both groups scored the weight examination as being easier than the blood pressure examination, which is understandable as the use of the weight scale is very simple. The results show the largest assessment difference between the 2 groups in the ease of use, with the CG performing better than the SG. This result is supported by Fig. 5 , which shows the average time required to perform the 5 tasks. There is a large difference in execution time between the 2 groups for all tasks, in particular, for the weight measurement. Despite these results, the SG assessed the perceived time to perform the examination not very differently of the CG (questions W3 and BP3 in Fig. 4) , which means that they considered the time as normal (i.e. the time they usually take with their own devices).",

Patients used the home-care platform to perform the examinations, according to scheduling. During this period, the research team provided help in clarifying procedures whenever requested, and had regular contact with health professionals. At the end of the 2-month period, health professionals answered the web portal assessment questionnaire regarding their interaction with the web portal. Given the small sample, we did not perform a statistical analysis, however it is worth noting that almost all usability items were scored at maximum. Biometric collected data were analysed by the health professionals, who calculated the mean SBP (systolic blood pressure) and DBP (dystolic blood pressure) and visit-to-visit BP to infer abnormalities, and analysed weight trends.

In the global score (Fig. 3) , the \"font size\" evaluation showed the greatest difference between the 2 groups, which may be explained by the lower visual acuity affecting the SG. The audio-description also received the largest score difference (Fig. 4) , which might be related to hearing loss as reported by several SG participants, or in more difficulty in dealing simultaneously with multisensory cues (visual and auditory). However, both the font size and the audio level can easily be improved thanks to the TV's large screen size and audio amplifier. The execution time to perform the tasks was much longer in the SG as observed in Fig. 5 , which results from the lowest motor weaknesses and coordination (e.g. mobility and dexterity) of the SG, but also the longer time to \"think about the action to take\" due to decline on executive functions [37] . The largest difference was observed for the weight measurement, as many of the senior participants took a significant amount of time to stand up and to step on the scale. Correlation analysis between age and execution time showed to be statistically significant for the CG but not for the SG. This corroborates the idea of a decline in motor and cognitive skills that affects the elderly above a certain age, which is more visible here because the average age of the SG participants is quite high (80 years). These results provide quantitative data on how the use of TV interaction may represent an important asset in comparison to tablets and smartphones, for which the negative effect of sensory and motor limitations would be much steeper. The ease of learning in the USE questionnaire (Fig. 6 ) was the worst dimension scored by the SG and with the largest difference between the 2 groups. This is explained by the decline in cognitive performance due to age [37] , for example, working memory, and is well evidenced by the item that obtained the lowest score (4.7 in 1-7 scale) in this dimension: \"I easily remember how to use it\". This very limiting issue for the elderly highlights the need to design the interaction procedures as simple as possible to be easily remembered. The non-correlation between \"execution time\" and \"education\" and between \"satisfaction\" and \"age\" shows that the interaction with the system was affected mainly by users' physical impairments and not by their literacy and that users' age did not influence their level of satisfaction, which supports the acceptance of the platform.",

The achieved results show that this is a viable solution, even though the sensory and cognitive deficits of the elderly have been shown to affect the interaction. It is worth remembering that in the interaction process of the proposed solution, there were basically 7 keys of the remote and 3 steps to memorize, namely selecting the type of task (e.g. perform examination or visualize data), selecting the participant and selecting the examination. Thus, the platform has been designed to minimize seniors' effort. Although the visual layout and widget placement of the user interface followed a standard approach, it was adjusted according to user feedback. Nevertheless, other interaction approaches can be researched following the \"one key -one function\" and \"one page -one task\" paradigms [38] , for example, to further minimize the number of items to memorize, the steps to be performed or the number of remote's keys to use. The level of digital literacy is of course an additional factor that affects the learnability of the interaction, as people who have never used a computer or a smartphone in their lives have no automated mental processes to navigate in the menus. In the current study, none of the SG participants have reported ever using a smartphone or tablet which enforces the idea that these devices might not be a solution for most older adults, although most proposed approaches are based on mobile applications. Another important observation that came up from the informal conversations with the elderly, related to socio-cultural issues, is the rejection of the technology in anticipation. Although using it efficiently and stating that it would be a useful platform, some seniors mentioned \"This is not for me\", which expresses the idea that technology is not for them, since they never used technology in their lives. Here, the role of health professionals, particularly doctors, can be important to change that mindset by \"prescribing\"/ recommending the platform as a medication, as elderly patients trust heavily on doctors [6] . Actually, remote patient monitoring is a promising contributor to warrant universal health coverage, acknowledged as a major goal by all the Member States of the World Health Organization.",

The stable hardware and software free of bugs, and the seemingly way that end-users operated different medical devices using the same interaction process, all contributed to the level of acceptance of the proposed solution. The usability evaluation results provide quantitative data that supports the viability of the VITASENIOR-MT solution based on TV interaction, in a population of senior participants with low digital literacy and education, which shows its potential adoption by the elderly as a consumer product for health. This stresses out that technology can be adopted by potential users as long as it offers characteristics of customization and universality. Therefore, human-computer interaction processes should be, sometimes, simplified to ensure universal access. From a hardware and data connectivity perspective, VITASEN-IOR-MT also presents some interesting features compared to other similar platforms, which are important for its adoption. Namely, 1) the solution is independent of the digital television network and operator and 2) the telehealth service can work without a continuous Internet link, since VITABOX is independent of television services. This is quite important, as user experience is not affected by network conditions and bandwidth, which may be particularly relevant in remote rural areas.",

The technology acceptance has been shown to be very dependent of users' profile [6] . Therefore, the experimental tests should go beyond nursing homes to broaden the spectrum of participants. The number of participants in the longitudinal tests was also very small, not allowing a statistical analysis, and they were carried out in a controlled environment (assisted dwelling centre). For example, it was not possible to evaluate how the use of the health platform may have disrupted their regular way of watching TV, as seniors used the community TV to watch TV and the TV in their rooms only for use as telehealth platform. Testing the solution in home-settings and involving the follow-up of family doctors is required to assess the effective acceptance and utility of the solution. Nevertheless, the highly positive appreciation of the VITASENIOR-MT platform by both senior end-users and health professionals is undoubtedly a good indicator of the telehealth platform's potential. This is also recognized by a Technology transfer agreement that was achieved with a telehealth company that is soon starting the commercialization of a solution based on VITASENIOR-MT, thus complementing a wearable monitoring device that the company currently commercializes.",

Overall results show that the levels of Ease of use, Ease of learning, Satisfaction and Usefulness of the home-care platform, validated by a senior group and a control group, were high, demonstrating the viability of TV interaction for the target population, with task performance and overall scores of the senior group approaching those of the control group. Additionally, it has been shown that, for the senior group, old age and low digital literacy and education are not statistically relevant in terms of the system usability and that the sensory deficits are the most limitative issues on the interaction. Most telehealth studies and implementations often disregard usability issues, or do not include them as part of the development phase, leading to systems that end up being a barrier to their adoption. Thus, the proposed solution is an important contribution and asset for the telehealth systems universe. Long-term testing has been conducted with a small number of participants and in a semi-controlled environment and need to be extended, but showed the potential benefit of the solution for healthcare follow-up.",
