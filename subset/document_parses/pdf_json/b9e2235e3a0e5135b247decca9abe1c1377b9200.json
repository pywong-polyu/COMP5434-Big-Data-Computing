[2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The aim of PCP is to support individuals to self-manage their own health and wellbeing, typically using behaviour change techniques (BCTs) to help achieve collaborative outcomes. The PCP process enables linkage to additional mechanisms for improving outcomes, including improved care coordination and better access to community resources. 1, 7 Recognised key outcomes of PCP are improved physical and mental health, selfmanagement capabilities, health-related behaviours, and changes in health service use. 1, 7 In the UK, the publication in 2018 of the Comprehensive Model of Personalised Care consolidated evidence demonstrating PCP as a promising approach to achieve change ( Figure 1 ). 7 This informed the 2019 NHS Long Term Plan, and the linked work programme to implement personalised care nationally. 8 As part of the NHS Long Term Plan, the NHS England Ageing Well programme specifies a multidisciplinary team approach to care for older people (generally defined as \u226565 years) defined as anticipatory care. Both personalised and anticipatory care were included in the draft 2020 primary care network direct enhanced service (PCN DES) specifications, but implementation was paused after the initial consultation period. 9 Personalised care plans for people eligible for anticipatory care -for example, those with frailtyestablish linkage across the individual specifications that are expected to form part of future GP contract negotiations.",

Identifying IFs alongside BCTs indicates which behavioural change mechanisms might work best. Healthcare and allied professionals are increasingly trained in and use BCTs and IFs to inform practice and interactions with clients. 13 The aim of this review was to identify relevant BCTs for use with older people to inform the development of the Personalised Care Planning for Older People with Frailty (PROSPER) intervention as part of a National Institute for Health Research Programme Grant for Applied Research (NIHR PGfAR). 14 The objectives were to:",

This could be a function of interventions being delivered by healthcare professionals (HCPs) who have additional responsibilities and thus less available time to implement the emotional social support BCT. Alternatively, emotional social support may not have been explicitly mentioned where it is perceived as a naturalised component of an HCP's role. 41 Many interventions provided some form of lifestyle information or education. The authors assumed that education provision would involve at least two BCTs -'information on health consequences' and 'instructions on how to perform a behaviour'. 11 BCTs were also coded in the control groups, which mostly comprised usual care.

They can easily be adopted by health and social care professionals working with this population to enhance existing health coaching skills. The authors anticipate that review findings will be especially useful in any future implementation of personalised and anticipatory care. The focus on BCTs that improve quality of life in older age is aligned with the growing recognition that this is an important outcome for older people. The review has limitations. All interventions used multiple BCTs, but it was not possible to assess the impact of individual BCTs on outcomes.
