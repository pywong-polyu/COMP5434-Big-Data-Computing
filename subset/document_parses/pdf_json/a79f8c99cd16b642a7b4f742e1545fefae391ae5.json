Study design Retrospective cohort study. Methods The infection was diagnosed in 136 individuals, and typing was confirmed by PCR and direct sequencing. The epidemiologic characteristics of the disease including the infection rate, incubation period, and basic reproductive number (R 0 ), ie, number of cases directly infected by an infectious patient during the course of the disease, were investigated. The effectiveness of compartmentalization for infection control was determined by simulating the outbreak using the Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model.",

The infection rates in the 3 schools were 13.2%, 16.9%, and 17.2%, respectively. The one class of school B without the index case was initially compartmentalized, and the infection rate in this compartment was 0%. The incubation period was calculated to be 9.3 \u00b1 3.5 days, and the disease duration, 13.0 \u00b1 5.4 days. The R 0 was 1.43. Using these parameters, a SEIR model was constructed. The SEIR model well predicted the daily incidence of infection and indicated that the compartmentalization method provides effective reduction in the incidence of the infection, with much earlier control. Conclusions The compartmentalization method is effective to control HAdV-54 outbreaks.",

The spread to schools A and C subsequently occurred presumably by direct contact with infected children possibly at public playgrounds or supermarkets, which were used by most of the islanders in the neighborhood. Thus, the outbreak spread to schools A and C through siblings, family members, or friends of B2 class. The outbreak first spread within the schools and then to the families of the infected children.

Therefore, we also evaluated the factors that were significantly associated with prolongation of the disease duration. Online Resource 2 (Supplementary Table 1 ) shows the demographic and clinical characteristics of HAdV-54 EKC. Using the Cox proportional hazards model, we found that the presence of MSI, which developed 19.0 (9.5 days) after the onset, and pseudomembranes prolonged the disease duration by 2 to 3 times (hazard ratio, 3.22; P = 0.005; Online Resource 3). This is consistent with the findings of an earlier report [5] . The presence of MSI had the strongest effect on the prolonged duration (hazard ratio, 5.26; P < 0.001). Male sex was also a significant risk for longer duration (hazard ratio, 2.38; P < 0.001). However, it remains unclear whether this may reflect sex-specific immune response activity or social behavior. For prevention of disease spread, we need to pay special attention to patients with these characteristics.",
