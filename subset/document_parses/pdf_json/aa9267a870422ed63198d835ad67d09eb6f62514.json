Portable high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) air purifiers are useful to remove both types of aerosols without relying on ventilation from outside the room. However in order to meet or exceed the recommended 4 to 6 air exchanges per hour (ACH), high price-points and filter replacement costs for select HEPA air purifier models without incurring excessive noise generation make them unaffordable for many households and communities.",

This classroom would therefore require two to three such air HEPA purifiers with sufficiently low noise generation typically costing $400-$500 each (with periodic $40-$80 filter replacements) to achieve the target ACH exceeding 4 to 6 ACH. For an upfront cost of approximately $1000-$1500 per classroom, this level of air filtration may be outside the budget of many schools in the US and worldwide. Approaching 15 ACH as in hospitals and passenger aircraft [9] would require further HEPA units putting it further out of reach. If portable HEPA air purifiers of sufficiently low noise generation with sufficiently high clean air delivery rate (CADR) are unaffordable for many communities, how else can they achieve target ACH while addressing [10] [11] both cost and noise generation concerns?",

California Air Resource Board recommends never leaving such devices unattended, and only using box fans manufactured in or after 2012 because these fans will have a fused plug to prevent electrical fires if the device is inadvertently knocked over [13] . Chemical Insights, a subsidiary of Underwriter Laboratories, recently tested five different electric box fan models (approximately 20\" \u00d7 20\" in size) with attached air filters and concluded that all measured temperatures fell below the maximum acceptable thresholds defined by the market safety standard for electric fans (UL 507) [14] .",

Yet the upfront cost of the components of the DIY setup were 5 to 10 times less ($35-$58) than the commercial HEPA air purifier ($375). The DIY setup also did not require tape but could be assembled with loose-fitting velcro or simply attached by the vacuum of the fan.",

The reason why there is a discrepancy between the results reported here and by UC-Davis remains to be reconciled. Anecdotally, we observed that the airflow was non-uniform across all four filters which may be responsible for this.",

Also a mosquito screen on the front of the fan may help prevent curious fingers from contacting the fan blade which may be especially important for classroom and home applications when young children are present.",
