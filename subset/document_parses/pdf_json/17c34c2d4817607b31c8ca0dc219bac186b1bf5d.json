As the pandemic persists, there has been a public demand to reopen schools and university campuses. To consider these demands, it is necessary to rapidly identify those individuals infected with the virus and isolate them so that disease transmission can be stopped. In the present study, we examined the sensitivity of the Quidel Rapid Antigen test for use in screening both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals at the University of Arizona from June to August 2020. A total of 885 symptomatic and 1551 asymptomatic subjects were assessed by antigen testing and real-time PCR testing. The sensitivity of the test for both symptomatic and asymptomatic persons was between 82 and 90%, with some caveats.",

Viral testing strategies must be specific for the disease, sensitive to low (possibly asymptomatic) viral loads and return results to those responsible in as short a time as possible [2] . Typically, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays have been the gold standard for viral diagnostic testing [3, 4] , but other testing options are available. Unfortunately, the PCR test is not generally a point-of-care test and often takes 48-72 h to return results, is relatively expensive at scale, has been plagued by reagent scarcity and may even be too sensitive at times [2] [3] [4] .",

Discordant findings where subjects were antigen-negative but PCR-positive for the presence of the virus were observed for specimens with high PCR cycle thresholds (of 31 and above). The overall results obtained in these studies provided a determination of 91.4% sensitivity with 100% specificity for the antigen test, similar to that claimed by the vendor. A select group of initially asymptomatic patients from the validation studies who tested positive during the validation studies were followed and tested for an additional 1-2 weeks using the rapid antigen test and PCR test as before. As shown in Table 2 , during subsequent testing once PCR cycle thresholds (ct) for locus N1 amplification were higher than 31 cycles, the rapid antigen test was unable to detect the presence of the virus. Preliminary results from such subjects have indicated that anti-virus antibody titers were present during those later test times when subjects displayed high ct values and that patients may not be contagious due to low viral loads or the absence of live virus. Although preliminary, these results may also suggest that the shedding of live virus as indicated by a positive rapid antigen test may only persist for a week (or so), despite continued reactivity by viral PCR analysis. To explore the limits of the rapid antigen assay, 885 students and staff presenting at university campus health were tested, including both those exposed to the virus (i.e., in close contact with someone that tested positive for the virus) and those symptomatic with cough, fever, aches, etc. were tested. As shown in Table 3 , more than half of all subjects (64.8%) presenting with symptomatic complaints were negative for the virus by both the PCR and rapid antigen tests. A total of 305 individuals tested positive by PCR (34.5%) while a total of 258 persons tested positive by the rapid antigen test (29.2%). Discordant PCR and rapid antigen testing results were once again observed in biospecimens with high PCR cycle thresholds (average ct of 34). It appeared that the Quidel rapid antigen test did not detect approximately 6% of the positive results detected by the PCR test. These samples displayed cts with 8 cycles higher on average. This finding implies that the COVID-19-positive samples that the Quidel test \"missed\" contained on average 256 times less viral load than the positive samples it could detect. Calculations from these results indicated a sensitivity of 82.3%, while the specificity of the rapid antigen assay was 98.2% based on a finding of 7 antigen-positive, PCR-negative results out of 885 total results. The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were calculated to be 97.3% and 91.4%, respectively. A similar assessment to that described was performed with a large sampling of the university campus staff and student body as shown in Table 3 . All subjects were randomly selected and asymptomatic at the time of both PCR and rapid antigen testing. The vast majority of subjects were virus-negative by both the PCR and the rapid antigen test (98%), as might be expected. Table 3 . Relationship between PCR cycle threshold and rapid antigen test reactivity. Data presented in Table 3 are stratified according to PCR cycle thresholds (ct). Subjects that tested PCR-positive and Ag-negative (in bold) were divided into two groups: <30 ct and >30 ct and mean (X) ct values were calculated.",

It was observed that symptomatic patients displayed lower cycle thresholds in the PCR analysis (see Figure 1 ) regardless of whether they were also Ag-positive for the virus. Reasons for this observation are not straightforward, but it may be that some SARS-CoV-2 infections are missed due to sampling or that lower PCR cycle thresholds may be a result of an unrecognized inflammatory immune reaction. Regardless, symptomatic patients seemed to require fewer PCR cycle times to detect the virus. Violin dot plots of the findings (Figure 1 ) demonstrated that subjects that were PCR-positive but Ag-negative displayed cycle times clustering at the higher end of the scale.",

Of note, asymptomatic subjects had higher underlying PCR cycle thresholds regardless of whether they were antigen-positive or negative, which has also been reported in a previous study [8] . Possibly the most significant observation from the study was that subjects missed with the rapid Ag test were generally only those with a PCR cycle threshold higher than 30 cycles, and possibly not infectious and/or less sick [9] . A ct of 30 cycles was chosen as the cut-off threshold as it reflects a potential viral load of 1000 virus particles, the minimum level thought to be needed for infectivity [10] . Overall, our findings based on validation samples as well as the analyses of symptomatic and asymptomatic samples indicated a sensitivity between 86 and 92% and a specificity of 97-99% for the rapid antigen test, for those individuals that are both infected and contagious with cycle thresholds under 30. That is, in symptomatic individuals the Ag test is very sensitive, while in asymptomatic individuals the Ag test detected less than half of those who had been infected with SARS-CoV-2 but identified 86% of those who were contagious and likely to spread the virus. In addition, based on the findings, a slightly higher false-negative rate for asymptomatic persons with the rapid antigen test could be overcome if one were to perform antigen testing a minimum of three times a week. Repeated testing could reduce to less than one percent the chance that any individual who is truly positive is missed by the antigen test [11] .",

            "text": "Interestingly, more than half of all subjects who presented at Campus Health with COVID-19 symptoms during the study period did not test positive for SARS-CoV-2 by either a rapid antigen or PCR test, a noteworthy and cautionary finding in and of itself. This finding also helps to explain the lower-than-expected positivity rates in the symptomatic population. Our observations seem to indicate that compared with the rapid antigen test the PCR test detects viral loads that may be 200-fold lower, which may not be biologically relevant in terms of infectivity/contagiousness [9, 10] . Recent evidence suggests that a PCR ct of 30 is the threshold for SARS-CoV-2 infectivity/contagiousness [10, 12, 13] . In fact, the rapid Ag test and the PCR test were generally concordant in their findings, although PCR testing may be overly sensitive (and the cut-off for PCR positivity may need to be lower than 40 cycles). The rapid Ag test may be best for determining if subjects are contagious and most likely to spread the virus, while the PCR test may be a better indicator for general infection and prevalence of the virus in the general population. Overall, the rapid antigen test seems to be sufficient and more than adequate for rapid screening of both asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. Importantly, the rapid antigen test can easily be scaled up to test 2000-3000 subjects per day without a considerable increase in staff and equipment, making it amenable to high-throughput, large scale screening efforts (based on our own experience at the University of Arizona where we have now administered and performed more than 200,000 such rapid Ag tests). It also can be readily used for the daily screening of select populations with only a small decrease in sensitivity as compared to PCR testing. The decreased sensitivity can be compensated for with the increased test frequency of those individuals. However, it must be remembered that both the rapid Ag test and the PCR test are point-in-time tests, with no guarantee that one does not become infected moments to hours to days after sample collection, emphasizing the need for face coverings and social distancing to finally stem the pandemic until a vaccine becomes widely available.
