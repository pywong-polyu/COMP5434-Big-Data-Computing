In six states, deaths in long-term care facilities accounted for over 50% of all COVID-19 deaths (Delaware, Massachusetts, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Colorado, and Utah). The high burden of COVID-19 within SNFs is principally due to the risk profile of many residents, which includes advanced age and the presence of severe comorbidities (1) . Accordingly, strategies to mitigate SARS-CoV-2 transmission to SNF residents have included restrictions on visitation, cessation of group activities and dining, and confinement to individual living quarters. While SNF residents are largely isolated, SNF employees are permitted to enter resident rooms provided they have passed a daily screening process for fever, COVID-19 respiratory symptoms or known exposure. However, a significant fraction of individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19, have a lengthy latency period prior to exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms, and many remain asymptomatic throughout the course of infection (2, 3) .

Swabs were assayed for virus infection by qRT-PCR and plaque assay, and individuals with evidence of infection were instructed to self-quarantine for ten days. Using data on worker infection, site-specific prevalence at study onset and incidence rate over time was calculated. Viral genomes also were sequenced to assess viral genetic diversity within and between SNFs. Our results document a surprising degree of asymptomatic infection among healthy workers, and extreme variation in the prevalence and incidence of infections between different SNFs. We observed that the median number of consecutive positive weekly tests was two, indicating that RNA was present in the nasopharynx of most individuals for at least eight days, however some individuals had viral RNA in their nasopharynx for over five weeks. A small number of individuals had RNA reappear in the nasopharynx after apparent clearance.

Due to their disproportionate contribution to the burden of COVID-19 mortality, they also represent an attractive target for surveillance testing and interventions that may include removing SARS-CoV-2 positive staff from the workplace. Therefore, we longitudinally sampled asymptomatic workers at five SNFs in Colorado to determine the proportion of workers at these facilities who had SARS-CoV-2 RNA in their nasopharynx, and continued weekly testing as they self-isolated for ten days. Return to work also required absence of fever for the final three days of isolation, without antipyretic use. Individuals who continued to test positive after two weeks were notified and recommended to continue self-isolation until a negative test result was returned. Our data clearly demonstrate the potential for large numbers of workers at SNFs to be asymptomatically infected and for the concentration of infections to vary widely across facilities. One facility never had a single worker test positive, while otfhers had up 22.5% of workers with SARS-CoV-2 RNA during the first week of surveillance. Infections varied considerably over time. The steady declines in the incidence of infections in staff in the two facilities with the highest initial infection prevalence is encouraging and hints at the potential impact of worker screening programs. However, the detection of incident infections at facility B, after four weeks of negative tests underscores the on-going threat of infections in worker populations. Notably, participation in our sampling scheme was high, with approximately 85% of workers from each facility being sampled each week.

This could be attributable to the presence of free RNA (i.e. RNA that is not packaged into virus particles) or to antibodies within the mucosa that neutralize virus infectivity. Therefore, we tested NP swab samples for the presence of infectious virus via plaque assay. Importantly, we found that viral RNA was strongly positively correlated with infectious virus. In samples with high levels of viral RNA (N1 CT<30), infectious virus tended to be present, whereas lower viral RNA levels often had undetectable levels of infectious virus. Because plaque assays have lower sensitivity than qRT-PCR, it is unsurprising that samples with fewer than ~1000 RNA copies tended to have undetectable levels of infectious virus.

Instead, this phenomenon may be due to host factors that led to suppression of viral replication in the nasopharynx, or an NP swab that failed to capture virus. It is also unlikely that the intervening negative tests in these individuals were due to poor RNA quality, because all samples were tested for human RNase P (CDC diagnostic guidelines) and had comparable levels across all samples. Sequencing of the viruses from these individuals, will help determine the likelihood of re-infection versus host factor activity. Sequencing of virus genomes also provided insights into SARS-CoV-2 transmission in our study population. Our data encompasses a sample of 48 genomes obtained during the first two weeks of observation (Site D is most highly represented because it had the highest number of SARS-CoV-2 cases during the first two weeks). Sequences from our study were compared to a strain sequenced during the early phase of the COVID-19 outbreak in the US, and to the four other SARS-CoV-2 sequences currently available from Colorado. The most notable feature of the phylogenetic tree is the fairly clear and consistent clustering of virus sequences by facility. This type of clustering could be due to transmission within staff at the facility, or from a shared community source outside of the workplace.
