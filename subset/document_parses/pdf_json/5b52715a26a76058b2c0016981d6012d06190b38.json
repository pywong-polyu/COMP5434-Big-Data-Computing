In particular, due to the difficulty in maintaining social distancing guidelines and in an attempt to allow the economy to recover by opening businesses, some elected officials have issued mask mandates for the public to reduce COVID-19 transmission. Research has demonstrated the effectiveness of masks in preventing the spread of infectious diseases through airborne droplets, 2 yet the majority of a community would need to be masked in order to reduce infection rates. Several governors have avoided state-level mandates by rationalizing that within-state variations of COVID-19 infection rates call for more localized public health policymaking than state-wide orders. 3 While studies found mask policies to be effective in reducing infection growth rates early in the pandemic, there is an urgent need to know how the impact of such policy persists over time; in addition, the impact on unequal infection rates such as higher rates reported among African-American/Black and Hispanic/Latinx populations. 1 Mask wearing has transitioned to a politically nuanced behavior, and this has been particularly true in the region surrounding the Midwestern city of St. Louis, providing a natural experiment to understand the longitudinal impact of a variable mask mandate policies has on county-level changes in incident CoVID-19 rates over a 12-week period.",
