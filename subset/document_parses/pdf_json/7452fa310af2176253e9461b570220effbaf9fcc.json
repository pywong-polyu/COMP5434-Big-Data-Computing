The majority of the patients contacted by telemedicine had breast cancer (n = 270; 64.1%). For 135 patients (32.1%) no further examination or intervention was required and the previously planned follow-up visit was postponed by the clinician.

This situation enabled about 30% of patients interviewed via telemedicine to be evaluated without any examination or intervention and their follow-up visits were postponed. While it may be possible to evaluate an early stage breast cancer patient with minimal examination or remote communication, it would be very difficult in a newly diagnosed patient or one with metastatic cancer of unknown primary. Therefore it is crucial to select carefully the appropriate patient group that can benefit from telemedicine in terms of making minimal mistakes in the treatment and follow-up processes. One of the best examples of telemedicine experiences during the pandemic was performed by Kang et al. In this study, 27% of patients with head and neck cancer required in-person care for a status check, whereas in follow-up visits no in-person care was required [12] .",

In most of the studies on telemedicine before the COVID-19 pandemic, patient satisfaction has been seen as one of the most important key points for success. A new study on this subject has been considered for the future. However, we can say that the telemedicine method has reached its intended goals.

Another advantage was that it allowed us to use less personal protective equipment. In this way it became possible to transfer this equipment to more critical units, such as intensive care units. There are also disadvantages of the system; for example, the lack of a full physical examination and the lack of in-person care, which may cause patient distrust. Other deficiencies are that the system does not have an authorized description in our country or in many other countries; therefore, the costs may not be covered or reimbursed by insurance systems.",
