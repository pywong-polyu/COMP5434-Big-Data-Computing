Bullying is defined as repeated and chronic negative actions directed at a student or group of students, characterized by a power imbalance between the aggressor and the victim [2, 3] . School bullying is described as a sort of violence that harms others and occurs when a student or a group of students use their strength to harm other individuals or other groups while at school or participating in various activities [4] . The most common types of bullying are physical (hitting, shoving, stealing, or damaging property), verbal (namecalling, mocking, or hurtful teasing), social (excluding others from a group, spreading rumors, or damaging friendships), sexual (dirty words, touch, or making sexist comments), and electronic or cyber-bullying (spreading rumors and hurtful comments via cell phones [e.g., text messaging], email, or social media) [5] .",

In addition, peer risk factors may include not conforming to peer-group norms [13] and having a delinquent record [14] are associated with bullies. School risk factors could be determined the bully behavior regarding the school environment [15] and teachers' responses to bullying behavior [16] . Children with bully behavior may also have experienced physical abuse and being from low socioeconomic status families with authoritarian parents [17] . Some researchers believe that psychopathology and bullying go hand in hand, while others disagree. There is evidence pointing to a bidirectional relationship between psychopathology and bullying. According to Hwang and Kim [18] , children who exhibit disruptive behavior, such as attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), may be more likely to engage in peer violence. A study conducted in Finland found that ADHD was the most common psychiatric disorder among children who were bullied [19] . Several studies investigating risk factors for bullying also reported that children with ADHD are more likely than neurotypical children to be involved in bullying, either as aggressors or victims [20] [21] [22] . Bullying is also a predictor of involvement in a wide range of violent and nonviolent behaviors. Individuals with a history of bullying were nearly 11 times more likely than nonbullying peers to be diagnosed with conduct disorder and nearly eight times more likely to meet the criteria for antisocial personality disorder, according to a multivariate analysis that controlled for sociodemographic, lifetime psychiatric disorders, and family history of antisocial behavior [23] .",

All questions were answered by (yes/no) except school achievement and body-build questions. School achievement was evaluated based on midterm scores achieved by students (scores < 60% = weak, 60-70% = average, > 70% = good).

National surveys conducted in 40 Western countries reported rates of involvement in bullying ranging from 4.8 to 45.2% [34] . A cross-sectional study on 1192 middle school students in Nigeria reported a 59.9% prevalence rate of bullying behavior [36] . Different methods and cultural differences in defining the problem, as well as differences in the target populations and instrumentation used, could account for the wide range of prevalence rates found across countries. Regarding forms of bullying, this study found that verbal and social bullying were most prevalent among our study group, followed by psychological and physical bullying. This finding is consistent with [32] , who reported that verbal bullying was most common, followed by social and then physical bullying among US adolescents from grade 6 to grade 10. Similarly, a study on forms of bullying among secondary school students aged 13 and 15 in Finland found that the most common forms of bullying were verbal teasing and social exclusion [31] .",

Males scored higher in verbal, psychological, and physical bullying, but females scored higher in social bullying. This finding can also be explained by cultural factors, as boys in Egyptian communities, especially Upper Egypt, are less often punished for misbehavior compared to girls. A similar finding was reported in a study of bullying behaviors among 8-to 15-year-olds of children in Finland. For direct aggression, men outperformed women, while for indirect aggression, women outperformed men [33] . Another study among US adolescents found that males were more involved in physical and verbal bullying, whereas females were more involved in social bullying [32] . Ref. [37] reported that males scored higher on the bullying scale among a sample of 454 public school students in Mississippi, USA. Another Egyptian study that assessed the prevalence and risk factors of violence among elementary school children in Cairo found that all forms of violence were higher among males [35] . When it comes to bullying, boys are more likely than girls to engage in overt forms of aggression (like physical bullying), while girls are more likely to engage in subtle forms of aggression (like gossiping, teasing, rejecting, verbal threatening, and humiliating) that can be difficult to identify [38] . The difference between these results and those of the present study might be explained by the different study settings as well as different tools used for assessment.",

Similar results were observed among female groups (bully and nonbully groups); female bullies scored significantly higher on all subscales except conduct problems. Our findings are in line with those of a study that assessed the association between ADHD with bullying in a population of 577 fourth graders in Sweden, which found that children diagnosed with ADHD were involved in bullying more often than other children [21] . Children with ADHD are at elevated risk of being involved in bullying either as aggressors or as victims in comparison with typical children, and ADHD is considered a risk factor for bullying [20, 22, 44] . Furthermore, a previous study conducted to evaluate the relationship between bullying and psychiatric disorders among 420 children in Finland found that ADHD, oppositional/conduct disorder, and depression were the most common psychiatric disorders among children involved in bullying [19] . Zablotsky and his colleagues [45] also found that children identified as bully-victims were more likely to have ADHD, conduct disorder, or oppositional defiant disorder than typical children, and the frequency of bullying behaviors was significantly associated with the level of psychological impairment.",

This finding can be explained by the small number of affected females, which made it difficult to demonstrate the difference between groups. Moreover, girls with ADHD appear to be less severely affected than boys, with fewer comorbid externalizing and internalizing behaviors [46] . This study has a few limitations, such as the relatively small sample size especially female's gender. Additionally, the current study investigated only traditional bullying, and the sample was selected from students in the fourth, fifth, and sixth grades in one primary school. Effects of grade level, socioeconomic status, family, and community risk factors for bullying were not included. This study relied on participants' honesty and accurate selfreporting to screen for bullying. Some students might have been embarrassed to admit involvement in bullying, which could have impacted the results. The 2019 coronavirus disease pandemic resulted in school closures, which limited the continuation of this study to obtain more data, such as IQ testing for the students.",
