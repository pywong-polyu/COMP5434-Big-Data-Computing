Throughout most of the first year of the pandemic, the Dutch government implemented only a limited set of preventive measures in educational settings to minimise educational disruption. Between November and December 2020, we conducted a series of four detailed outbreak investigations in schools that reported clusters of SARS-CoV-2 infections. At the time, all primary and secondary schools were open and had full occupancy. There was little prior immunity against SARS-CoV-2, vaccines were not yet available and the wild-type variant with the D614G mutation was dominant at the time of the study.",

Students and teachers who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had to self-isolate at home. Classroom contacts were not quarantined unless considered a close contact, defined as exposure of >15 minutes at <1.5 meter distance to a SARS-CoV-2 infected individual. From December 2020 onwards, mask mandates were in place for students and staff during movement. Seated students and staff did not wear masks. Schools were recommended to increase hand hygiene and the degree of ventilation, plastic shields were installed on teacher desks and all school-based extracurricular activities were cancelled. Testing of asymptomatic close contacts was implemented during the study period (1 December 2020). Other national COVID-19 measures in place at the time, are described in the supplement.",

A sampling location at the school was set-up where participants could self-collect a combined mid-turbinate NTS sample and a saliva sample under direct supervision of trained study staff after instructions had been provided. For participants who were not present at school, samples were self-collected under supervision of study staff at their home address. Participants also completed a questionnaire including basic demographics, other recent exposure to SARS-CoV-2 infected individuals (other than school index case), prior infection and presence of COVID-19 like symptoms. A second sampling visit was scheduled after 4-7 days, depending on the weekends, for a follow-up NTS and saliva sample from each participant, along with a follow-up questionnaire on recent exposure, symptoms and whether household members tested positive since the previous visit.

In these studies, several air samples collected in COVID-19 infected mink farms, and a high percentage of both air and surface swab samples collected in rooms in nursing homes with SARS-CoV-2 positive patients [1, 22] . A previous study in London also found limited evidence of SARS-CoV-2 contamination in school environments [18] . Only in a minority (<2-5%) of surface swab samples taken in both the classrooms of index cases and the washrooms, low amounts of viral RNA could be detected, some of which were collected before deep cleaning took place.

First, schools implemented various measures to increase (hand) hygiene and prevented social gatherings. Second, schools increased their ventilation regimes by opening doors and windows and installing new mechanical ventilation systems. Although, the effect of these interventions on SARS-CoV-2 transmission is still unclear. Third, in the nursing home and mink farm studies samples were collected in the vicinity of acute phase shedding SARS-CoV-2 patients or minks. This is in contrast with the secondary schools, where the known cases were isolated at home. Moreover, most infected students and teachers were asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic which is known to be associated with lower infectiousness [23] . Lastly, SARS-CoV-2 spread and transmission is suggested to be a more local phenomenon, suggesting direct droplet contact and/or close range aerosol (up to several meters) as the dominant route of transmission in the school environment [22, 24] .",

Second, the low participation rate among contacts may have resulted in under-or overestimation of the SAR due to selection bias. Third, we only invited students to participate if they shared a classroom with the index case. Consequently, we may have missed secondary cases among other school contacts with whom the index case spent time during breaks. Fourth, we cannot conclude that the observed SAR solely reflects school transmission rates, because sequencing of samples was incomplete for secondary cases and not available for index cases. The SAR may therefore have been somewhat inflated by simultaneous unrelated introductions.

Absence of widespread air or surface contamination suggests transmission may have occurred most likely via direct route or close range aerosol transmission route. Repeated testing is complementary and therefore recommended when complete case detection is desired.
