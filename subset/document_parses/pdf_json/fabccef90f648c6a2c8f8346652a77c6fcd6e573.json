In our collected dataset of Ethereum network transactions, we found that the mean transaction fee for all Ethereum transactions that interacted with a contract was 0.00632 ETH with a standard deviation of 0.0618 ETH and a median of 0.00257 ETH. Forsage transactions paid a higher average transaction fee of 0.0116 ETH with a standard deviation of 0.0108 ETH and a median of 0.00883 ETH.

Every transaction that interacts with Forsage through its two main functions, registrationExt and buyNewLevel, uses two of these three most expensive categories, often multiple times: they make use of persistent storage via SSTORE and SLOAD operations, and send money to other users on the network using Solidity operations that compile to the CALL opcode. Forsage uses an average number of CALL operations, but makes heavy use of SSTORE and SLOAD, as shown in Table 1 . Figure 2 shows a superimposed histogram of Forsage transactions relative to all Ethereum transactions.

If the direct upline of this new user is not blocked, then the upline gets the payment. If the upline has a blocked slot, the contract checks the upline's upline for that matrix slot level to see if it is blocked. This iterates through uplines until the contract finds one that is unblocked, which it then pays. The contract owner (i.e., the user that created the contract) is always unblocked, so the contract always finds a user to pay. This can sometimes result in the same user being payed twice (once by each half), or uncles and aunts being paid by their nephews and nieces in the tree if it has been previously scrambled. This condition is called spillover. Spillover means that it is possible to earn money by receiving payments that should have gone to another user who had blocked slots. This passive earning is possible only in the X4 system, and only if a spillover recipient's upline is blocked and cannot currently receive payment. A given user's chance of spillover is unpredictable, because it depends on the actions of other users. In our analysis of the transactions to Forsage from its conception until January 14th, 2021, we found that 35,251 transactions (only 1.08%) contained spillover payments. Of those transactions 63% were registrations, and the remaining 37% resulted from buying new levels.",

Likewise, if the upline gets replaced as the referrer, it is always replaced with a user further up in the pyramid. Thus, as users refer others and have their slots blocked as a result, the upline for all users eventually converges to the owner of the contract. Finally, the logic that prevents the owner's slots from becoming blocked also means that the owner's children do not change once set. This means that the owner maintains the oldest users in the pyramid as children, which results in high spillover in the X4 matrix.",

This clone launched before the official TRX Matrix contract, and has a different domain 12 but with graphics and style akin to the official website.

This is a non-custodial service, which means accounts are associated with individual users rather than with the exchange. Thus, if most users followed this advice, we would expect to see that most of the ETH came from untagged sources.

We did so by coding the claims asserted about Forsage in these videos. We focused on just the top ten videos because coding claims is a labor-intensive, manual process. A researcher watched each video and noted if each video contained any instance of certain claims (see Table 4 and Appendix B). Each video was watched and coded twice to ensure accuracy. The top ten YouTube videos we coded had between 267,008 views (1st) and 61,996 views (10th). Beyond the videos we coded, the 11th most viewed video had just over 50,000 views 20 and the 20th had 33,000 views. 21 The top 10 \"Forsage\" YouTube videos by views as of December 14, 2020 (see Appendix B) fit into three categories: official promotion, user-led recruitment, and user reviews. Two of the videos were official promotion posted to Forsage's YouTube channel [27, 28] . Table 4 shows the repeated claims across the top ten videos.",

To understand how professionals navigate these tensions, we spoke to an antimoney laundering cryptocurrency investigator at a high profile exchange. This expert expressed a belief that it is the responsibility of law enforcement and regulators to comment on whether or not an address should be blocked, and that it would be unfair and unjust to hold a user's funds without an explicit request from law enforcement or a court of competent jurisdiction. Nevertheless, some exchanges have joined the alliances mentioned above, due to the time and resources required to maintain a dedicated list of blocked addresses themselves.",

For Ethereum based scams, Chen et al. used data mining and machine learning to detect Ponzi schemes [13] while Yu et al. modeled Ponzi scheme identification and detection as a node classification task [41] . Bartoletti et al. characterized and summarized the Ethereum Ponzi scheme ecosystem by comparing the code and promotion for Ethereum smart contract schemes [8] . They found that scammers use the guaranteed execution of smart contracts public nature of Ethereum to inspire confidence in their victims. For Bitcoin, Vasek et al. [36] and Bartoletti et al. [9] both worked to detect and model Bitcoin-based scams. These included Ponzi schemes that collect Bitcoin from victims, where Vasek et al. found that more than half of scams last less than one week. 22 https://cryptodefendersalliance.com/ 23 https://www.cryptosafe.org/ Paquet-Clouston et al. [30] and Xia et al. [38] studied specialized scams that leverage Bitcoin for payments: respectively, scams to extort payments using threats of revealing intimate data, and scams claiming to raise money for COVID-19 research and relief.",
