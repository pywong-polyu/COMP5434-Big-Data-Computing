            "text": "Although airborne transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from person-to-person over long distances is currently thought to be unlikely, the current epidemiological evidence suggests that airborne SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission in confined, indoor spaces is plausible, particularly when outdoor airflow rates are low and when face masks are not utilized. We sought to model airborne infection transmission risk assuming five realistic exposure scenarios using previously estimated outdoor airflow rates for 12 New York City nail salons, a published quanta generation rate specific to SARS-CoV-2, as well as the Wells-Riley equation to assess risk under both steady-state and non-steady-state conditions. Additionally, the impact of face mask-wearing by occupants on airborne infection transmission risk was also evaluated. The risk of airborne infection transmission across all salons and all exposure scenarios when not wearing face masks ranged from <0.015% to 99.25%, with an average airborne infection transmission risk of 24.77%. Wearing face masks reduced airborne infection transmission risk to between <0.01% and 51.96%, depending on the salon, with an average airborne infection transmission risk of 7.30% across all salons. Increased outdoor airflow rates in nail salons were generally strongly correlated with decreased average airborne infection transmission risk. The results of this study indicate that increased outdoor airflow rates and the use of face masks by both employees and customers could substantially reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission in New York City nail salons. Businesses should utilize multiple layers of infection control measures (e.g. social distancing, face masks, and outdoor airflow) to reduce airborne infection transmission risk for both employees and customers.",

During the early stages of viral spread in the United States, infection mitigation strategies focused on viral transmission via fomites, or inanimate objects and surfaces that may carry infectious agents, such as door handles and elevator buttons. Large (>5-10 mm), virus-containing respiratory droplets emitted when infected individual coughs, sneezes, or talks, for instance, may contaminate a surface (WHO, 2020) . Exponential decay of SARS-CoV-2 has been observed across different media, with estimated median half-lives of approximately <1 h on copper, <4 h on cardboard, 5.6 h on stainless steel, and 6.8 h on plastic (van Doremalen et al., 2020) . Self-inoculation with SARS-CoV-2 could, therefore, occur if a susceptible (i.e. non-COVID-19-infected) individual touches a contaminated surface and subsequently touches the mucous membranes of their nose, mouth, or eyes (Otter et al., 2016; WHO, 2020) . As such, initial recommendations consisted primarily of frequent handwashing as well as disinfection of high-touch surfaces with US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)registered disinfectants (EPA, 2020) .",

Rather, a growing body of epidemiological evidence indicates that this novel human coronavirus is primarily spread from person-to-person via respiratory droplets or droplet nuclei, such that the risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission is likely highly dependent on both the duration of exposure and proximity to an infectious individual. Infectious respiratory droplets may land on the mucous membranes of a susceptible individual in close contact with an infected individual or may be inhaled by a susceptible individual in close proximity (CDC, 2020c) . The CDC has defined \"close contact\" as being \"within 6 feet of an infected person for at least 15 min starting from 2 days before illness onset (or, for asymptomatic patients, 2 days prior to positive specimen collection) until the time the patient is isolated\" (CDC, 2020a) . Indeed, many COVID-19 outbreaks have originated in indoor environments, including restaurants (Lu et al., 2020) , churches (Yong et al., 2020) , and cruise ships (Moriarty et al., 2020) , where individuals are generally in close proximity with one another for extended periods of time and are talking, shouting, and/or singing-all activities that tend to produce respiratory droplets. Recommendations for universal (and proper) use of face masks and social distancing among the general public have proven effective in curtailing community spread of COVID-19 (Chu et al., 2020) .",

Droplet nuclei are airborne residues (generally, 5 mm) of infectious aerosols from which the majority of respiratory fluid has evaporated (WHO, 2020). It has been demonstrated under experimental conditions that SARS-CoV-2 in aerosolized form may remain viable for up to approximately 3 h (van Doremalen et al., 2020) ; real-world evidence for airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is still being gathered (Lednicky et al., 2020; Morawska and Cao, 2020) . Given the currently available information regarding airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses, however, it is reasonable to assume that SARS-CoV-2 transmission may occur if a susceptible individual inhales a sufficient quantity of viable droplet nuclei, though it is our understanding at the time this article was written that the infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 above which there is a significantly increased risk of developing COVID-19 has not yet been established. Therefore, in addition to infection control measures like social distancing and face masks, attention must be given to ensuring adequate engineering controls in indoor environments (e.g. outdoor airflow), particularly in occupational settings where workers may be indoors for 8 h a day and interact with numerous individuals throughout the workday.",

Indeed, the American Industrial Hygiene Association (AIHA) has recently issued a COVID-19 guidance document specifically related to business reopening recommendations for nail salons (AIHA, 2020). We (AH and BP) have previously investigated indoor air quality issues at various nail salons in New York City. In a pilot study of 10 salons, total volatile organic compounds and carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) concentrations were measured (Pavilonis et al., 2018) , and we found that contaminant variation was generally minimal within each salon (i.e. well-mixed room). In a follow-up study, we estimated outdoor airflow rates per person using CO 2 concentrations in 12 nail salons over three consecutive days and found little daily variation in airflow rates within salons; however, there were orders of magnitude differences in outdoor airflow rates between salons (Harrichandra et al., 2020) .",

On July 6, 2020, New York City entered phase 3 of reopening, which allowed for the reopening of personal care services, including nail salons, with precautionary measures in-place (New York State Governor's Office, 2020). As of this same date, there were approximately 216,000 cases of COVID-19 in New York City, with about 18,600 confirmed deaths and about 4600 probable deaths due to COVID-19 (New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, 2020).",

            "text": "While three primary modes of transmission (contact via fomites, respiratory droplet transmission, and airborne [droplet nuclei] transmission) have been postulated during the COVID-19 pandemic, the focus of the current study is the risk of potential airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in New York City nail salons. To estimate the risk of airborne infection transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in the confined, indoor spaces of New York City nail salons, the Wells-Riley equation can be utilized. This model was developed by Riley et al. (1978) to quantitatively assess the airborne risk of measles transmission during an outbreak in New York State in 1974. Riley et al. (1978) based their model on the \"quantum of infection\" concept first introduced by William Firth Wells in 1955 to signify the smallest dose of any infectious agent to cause infection in 63% of susceptible hosts (Wells, 1955) . As explained by Rudnick and Milton (2003) exposure to one quantum of infection gives an average probability of 63% (1 \u00c0 e \u00c01 ) of becoming infected (essentially an infectious dose 63%, ID 63 ) . . . The belief that multiple independently deposited organisms are required to initiate infection is not borne out by biological evidence, nor is it biologically plausible. Thus q represents the generation rate of infectious doses, not organisms or infectious particles; it is the average infectious source strength of infected individuals. (Rudnick and Milton, 2003: 238) The infectious dose of SARS-CoV-2 that may ultimately lead to COVID-19 development is unknown, but the infectious dose (LD 10 and LD 50, respectively) for SARS-CoV-1 in animal studies was estimated to be 43-280 plaque-forming units (Watanabe et al., 2010) . Using the average infectious dose coefficient (0.02) derived by Watanabe et al. (2010) , the viral load of the sputum (10 9 RNA virus copies/mL), and light exercise as the level of activity, the resulting quanta generation rate for SARS-CoV-2, as reported by Buonanno et al. (2020) , was 142 quanta/h. The objective of this study was to estimate the risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission in New York City nail salons under steady-and nonsteady-state conditions using previously estimated outdoor airflow rates (Harrichandra et al., 2020) .",

For example, the risk of airborne infection transmission in scenario 1 ranged from 17.54% to 99.25% when neither party were wearing face masks but decreased substantially to 2.85% to 51.96% when both parties wore face masks. Overall, there was an approximately 2-to 6-fold risk reduction in scenario 1 when face masks were worn. Furthermore, steadystate quanta concentrations were achieved between 25 min to 256 min across all 12 salons for scenario 1. In Figure 1 , for example, steady state was reached in 118 min in salon 1. Table 3 presents a comparison of airborne infection transmission risk under non-steady-state conditions for all salons when occupants (employees and customers) were not wearing face masks, compared to the airborne infection transmission risk when occupants were wearing face masks. As demonstrated in Figure 2 , when the infected customer leaves the nail salon, the quanta concentration decreases and eventually reaches zero after 91 min, which is achieved at an outdoor airflow rate of 14.1 m 3 /min. Smaller nail salons with lower outdoor airflow rates typically had a higher risk of airborne infection transmission across all exposure scenarios evaluated. Salon 12 with an outdoor airflow rate of 94.19 m 3 /min had a risk of airborne infection transmission ranging from <0.015% to 17.54% (mean \u00bc 2.59%) across all five scenarios, while salon 3 with the lowest outdoor airflow rate of 3.72 m 3 /min had a risk of airborne infection transmission ranging from 1.47% to 99.25% (mean \u00bc 26.17%).

Previously published outdoor airflow rate data (Harrichandra et al., 2020 ) and a quanta generation rate for SARS-CoV-2 (Buonanno et al., 2020) were used in the Wells-Riley model to assess the risk of airborne infection transmission under various hypothetical exposure scenarios characterized by the interaction of employees and customers in nail salons in New York City. The modeled data indicate that adequate outdoor airflow rates and the use of face masks by both employees and customers could substantially reduce the risk of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission in New York City nail salons.",

            "text": "In New York City, many nail salons have adopted the CDC's guidelines for protecting employees and customers, such as practicing social distancing through a reduction in the capacity of services to fewer customers at any given time, removing waiting areas and accepting customers by appointment only, installing Plexiglas between service stations, and requiring all employees and customers to wear face masks at all times (CDC, 2020b) . The results of this study indicate that increased outdoor airflow can reduce the risk of airborne infection transmission. For example, salon 3 had the lowest outdoor airflow rate (3.72 m 3 /min) among all of the salons and, subsequently, the highest risk of airborne infection transmission across both steady-state (scenario 1 \u00bc 99.25%) and non-steady-state (scenario 5 \u00bc 25.47%) scenarios, when no face mask-wearing was assumed. In comparison to salon 12, which had the highest outdoor airflow rate (94.19 m 3 /min), the risk of airborne infection transmission was the lowest among both steady-state (<17.54%) and non-steadystate (<1.19%) scenarios, when no face mask-wearing was assumed. It should be noted that salon 12 utilized natural ventilation and did not have a dedicated exhaust. While this method of control is feasible in the summer months, this would not be effective in colder months. In a similar study focusing on the role of ventilation in the spread of COVID-19, it was concluded that reducing occupancy by 50% reduced the risk of airborne infection transmission by 6.7% based on a 90-min exposure duration in a restaurant, with similar dimensions to the nail salons; however, it was also demonstrated in this study that increasing the ventilation rate by approximately 27% could achieve the same rates of airborne infection transmission risk reduction (Sun and Zhai, 2020) .",

In scenario 3 in which two customers, one infected and one susceptible, enter the salon at the same time and both stay for 150 min, the airborne infection transmission risk increases substantially until the infector leaves but does not immediately drop to zero. In scenario 4 in which an infected customer enters the salon and stays for 45 min, while one susceptible customer enters 30 min after the infected customer and stays for 60 min, the risk of airborne infection transmission was still high and ranged from >0.01% to 9.83% across salons. This finding may explain why the SARS-CoV-2 virus spread so quickly initially in densely-populated cities around the world and should be a consideration as businesses reopen to the public. Merely permitting fewer customers may not sufficiently reduce the risk of airborne infection transmission without increasing the amount of outdoor airflow. If outdoor airflow remains the same, the rate at which customers enter the salon can be reduced so that fewer customers are in the salon when the concentration of infectious materials is at its highest, before concentration decay begins. This can be achieved through appointments that stagger the arrival of customers over a given time.",

The results of this study demonstrated that a face mask worn by both infected and susceptible parties could substantially reduce the risk of airborne infection transmission, even when outdoor airflow rate was poor and the duration of exposure was long. In the worst-case scenario of two employees, one infected and one susceptible, spending a full workday together and assuming that no other infected person enters the salon (i.e. scenario 1), the risk of airborne infection transmission of the susceptible employee was reduced from an average of 79.71% when neither parties wore a face mask to 26.97% when both parties wore a face mask, an almost 3-fold reduction in risk. Further, in salon 3, which had the lowest outdoor airflow rate, wearing face masks reduced the risk of airborne infection transmission by 47.29% for scenario 1. In a recent study of COVID-19 transmission in a hair salon, where two symptomatic, COVID-19-positive hair stylists served 139 clients, all wearing masks, over 15-to 45-min periods (mean \u00bc 19.5 min), there were no reported positive cases within a 14-day period (Hendrix et al., 2020) .",

The value of the quanta generation rate (q) has varied among a few studies (Buonanno et al., 2020; Dai and Zhao, 2020; Zemouri et al., 2020) and needs to be studied further. The value of q used in this study was derived from a novel approach based on the viral load emitted in saliva (Buonanno et al., 2020) . Yet there may be more accurate values based on other approaches. In this study, we used a conservative value for the quanta reduction potential of face masks based on several studies. The risk of airborne infection transmission may vary significantly from the modeled results presented in this study when different types of face masks are utilized in different settings. In addition, we assumed one infected individual was present in each of the exposure scenarios. Future research should evaluate airborne infection transmission risk assuming multiple infected individuals are present in a confined space for a given period of time.",

Social distancing and reduction of contact time are also essential to reducing the risk of airborne infection transmission. As New York State continues to gradually reopen, it is imperative for individuals to continue observing social distancing and face maskwearing requirements and for establishments to ensure that buildings are properly ventilated and are not overcrowded to mitigate potential airborne SARS-CoV-2 infection transmission risk.",
