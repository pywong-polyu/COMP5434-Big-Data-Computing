There have been some reports of isolated diarrhea preceding cough and fever. Ageusia or dysgeusia are also early symptoms in the course of mild to moderate disease. Haematochezia has also been reported though rare. 14,15 \u2022 Molecular testing RT-PCR on respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab or wash out) is required to confirm the diagnosis. \u2022 The viral RNA is detectable in some GI secretions and in stool. Gastrointestinal infection and potential fecaloral transmission must be considered. \u2022 Abnormal liver enzymes are observed in 20-30% of persons with COVID-19 infection. \u2022 There is usually a decrease in leukocyte count with elevated white blood cell count being a poor prognostic indicator. \u2022 Seeking medical care early for symptoms such as fever, cough, and difficult breathing, and sharing previous travel and contact history with healthcare providers improve outcome of the disease.",

Consider extended use or reuse of surgical masks and eye protection in accordance with hospital policies. Conservation of PPE is critical during this era. \u2022 In the case of confirmed COVID-19 positive patients, or patients awaiting test results, isolation precautions should be taken, and re-evaluation done on the need for GI endoscopy. If considered non-urgent then procedure should be rescheduled but if considered urgent or emergency, then procedure should be performed in negative pressure room with appropriate PPEs. \u2022 Institutions must have a dedicated phone line for follow-up for COVID-19 symptoms after consultation and procedures i.e., at day 7 and 14 post clinic visits. \u2022 Virtual consultation systems must be encouraged to avoid overcrowding and assist with pre-hospital COVID-19 screening. \u2022 Staff training and psychological support during this era is paramount for a safe work environment.
