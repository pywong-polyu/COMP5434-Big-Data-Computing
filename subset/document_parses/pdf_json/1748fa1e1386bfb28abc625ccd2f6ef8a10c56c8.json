Optimization of the selected composition of SNEDDS was conducted using a D-optimal mixture design. SNEDDS was prepared by loading 150 mg/mL of PE in oil, surfactant, and cosurfactant phases. The thermodynamic stability test was carried out with phase separation parameters followed by the robustness to dilution and accelerated stability test. The immunostimulant activity was examined in vitro and in vivo by determining the phagocytic activity, cell proliferation, production of nitrite oxide levels of RAW 264.7 cells, phagocytic activity of macrophages, and the number of leukocytes, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. The formula optimization showed that the formula containing Capryol-90, Cremophor RH40, and PEG 400 at a ratio of 30: 34: 36 was optimum. The verification response of the optimum formula with drug loading showed that the transmittance, droplet size, and zeta potential were 96.90 \u00b1 0.00%, 28.7 \u00b1 1.20 nm, and \u00c056.5 \u00b1 2.05 mV, respectively. The thermodynamic stability test and robustness to dilution did not find any separation phase. The accelerated stability test results were classified as stable. The in vitro and in vivo immunostimulant activity test showed that PE-loaded SNEDDS exhibited a higher immunostimulant effect than PE. In conclusion, the optimum and stable composition of PE loaded SNEDDS was found with a simple and accurate method using the D-Optimal mixture design and demonstrated an immunostimulant activity.",

Propolis is a thick substance like resin, with a yellowish to light brown color (Iqbal et al., 2019) . Propolis gives various health benefits through its essential roles as an immunomodulatory, antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal, antiparasitic, antiinflammatory, and antitumor agent (Gargouri et al., 2019) . Recent research also reports other benefits of propolis in the pharmaceutical field. Standardized ethanol extract of Indian propolis shows its potential as anti-carcinogenic (Kapare et al., 2019) . Propolis extract (PE) shows a significant reduction in oxidative damage from oxidative stress and a significant protective effect against hepatotoxicity (Chaa et al., 2019) . Oral administration of micellar propolis nanoformulation is promising as an oral delivery system of propolis against oxidative stress injury in the liver cells (Tzankova et al., 2019) . A previous study reports that PE has an immunomodulatory effect and boosts the immune response with an increase in the phagocytic index, NO production, and the production of IgG antibodies (Kalsum, 2017) .",

CAPE is also https known as an immunomodulating agent and should be considered as an alternative to help reduce an exaggerated inflammatory response (Berretta et al., 2020; Orsatti et al., 2010) .

SNEDDS has a droplet size on a nanometer scale and has proved to increase bioavailability and maintain stability (Anton and Vandamme, 2011; Syukri et al., 2017) . SNEDDS has more advantages than other lipid carriers, such as being more stable in storage, more practical, and quickly produced on a large scale. SNEDDS can be absorbed through the lymphatic pathway to avoid the first-pass effect, dissolve hydrophobic compounds, and turn droplets into phases that are more easily absorbed in the body fluid (Kassem et al., 2016) . SNEDDS formulations have been widely used and shown to increase the solubility of embelin (Parmar et al., 2015) , nystatin (Kassem et al., 2016) , and adefovir dipivoxil (Gupta et al., 2011) . Meanwhile, andrographolide in self-nano emulsifying is reported effective to prevent diabetes by lowering blood glucose levels, ameliorating islet beta cells, and inhibiting lipid formation in adipocyte cells (Syukri et al., 2021b) .",

            "text": "The optimum formula of PE-loaded SNEDDS shows excellent compatibility with the target value, and it has a droplet size of less than 200 nm. The optimum formula had a droplet size of 28.7 \u00b1 1. 20 nm. Droplet size is of the primary essential qualities of nanoemulsion for stability assessment and a fundamental advance in improving assimilation of medicament. Its smaller size results in greater interfacial surface area for assimilation of medicament and enhanced bioavailability and pharmacological effect (Verma and Kaushik, 2020) . The higher the ratio of surfactant and cosurfactant concentration, the lower the droplet size produced (Kadu et al., 2011) . The bioavailability of drugs in the body will increase correspondingly with a decreasing droplet size (Date et al., 2010) . The addition of surfactants and co-surfactants to the drug delivery system can increase dissolution and spread the drug in the digestive tract. In the dilution process, surfactants and cosurfactants form stable bonds with their water carriers (Parmar et al., 2011) . The surfactants act to break and reduce droplet size in the emulsion, while co-surfactants help cover small gaps between surfactants. PE-loaded SNEDDS had an excellent zeta potential value of \u00c056. 5 \u00b1 2.05 mV. The zeta potential value represents the level of inherent stability in a colloidal system. Droplets with a large zeta charge with a positive or negative potential will repel each other to produce no coalescence. In comparison, a load that is too small will not produce sufficient force. An excellent zeta potential value is higher than + 30 mV or lower than \u00c030 mV. Zeta has the potential to help prevent droplets from attracting each other, which results in precipitation. The formation of the resisting force also prevents enlarged droplet sizes (Chaudhary et al., 2019) . Zeta potential values determine the potential stability of the SNEDDS in the aqueous system. Zeta potential is the charge that develops at the interface between a solid surface and its liquid medium. If the dispersed par- ticles of aqueous media have high positive or negative zeta potential values, they will repel each other to create dispersion stability. On the other hand, substantially low zeta potential values of the dispersant cannot prevent the particles from coming together and become unstable (Kazi et al., 2021) . The thermodynamic stability studies showed that the optimum formula of PE-loaded SNEDDS remained transparent and homogeneous. Kinetic strength is one of the required characteristics of PEloaded SNEDDS because stability can distinguish a nanoemulsion from an emulsion. PE-loaded SNEDDS spontaneously forms nanoemulsions when dissolved in a solvent without exhibiting phase separation and precipitation during storage (Kassem et al., 2016) . The thermodynamic studies were done to investigate the dispersion efficiency and stability of SNEDDS in gastrointestinal fluids. Thermodynamic stability is an indicator of dispersion's kinetic stability and is generally used to study the chemical reactions occurring between the components of dispersion. Poor stability of dispersion can lead to precipitation or phase separation, which could affect drug absorption and therapeutic efficacy (Buya et al., 2020; Usmani et al., 2019) .",
