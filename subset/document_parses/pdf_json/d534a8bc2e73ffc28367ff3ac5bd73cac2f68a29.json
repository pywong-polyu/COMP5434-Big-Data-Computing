            "text": "Because of the life threatening nature of SARS and the increasing workload, frontline health workers were at risk of occupational stress (Chan & Chan 2003 , Thompson et al. 2004 . Nurses in my ward started to grumble in the midst of the SARS outbreak. Negative emotions of fear, worry and guilt emerged and a real threat to physical safety existed. Some nurses practiced self-quarantine for the fear of spreading the disease to family members, and this caused frustration and feeling of isolation. As a nurse manager working at the middle management level, I sensed the tension and urgency to handle the staff's stress reactions, as Shilling and Brackbill (1987) reported that exposure to occupational stress contributes to employee burnout, acute and chronic health conditions, poor staff morale and reduced job performance. Without proper management of their stress, nurses might give up their role in the so-called 'historical battle of SARS' (Chan & Chan 2003) . This paper describes the authors' use of reflective practice in supporting frontline nurses to fighting against SARS. Reflection is usually initiated when uncomfortable feelings and thoughts are sensed in a unique situation (Hancock 1999) . The word 'reflection' originates from the Latin verb reflectere that means 'bend' or 'turn backwards' (Hancock 1999) . Boyd and Fales (1983) defines reflection as a process of internally examining an issue of concern triggered by an experience, and creating and identifying personal meaning of the experience. The concept of reflective practice has been developed in nursing practice as a vehicle to enable nurses to articulate and learn from their work experience (Hancock 1999) . As Schon (1987) argued, professionals are less likely to solve problems by making reference to academic knowledge but are more likely to refer to their own 'theories in use' that are gained from working experience.",

Johns (1994a) suggests that reflection can be a painful experience and a difficult task without expert guidance and support. Through the structured guidance provided by John's model, the practitioner's sense of awareness, reflectiveness, and commitment can be nurtured. This model aims to tune the practitioner's experience into a structured and meaningful one, therefore enabling the reflective practitioner to make sense of and subsequently learn from their experience (Johns 1994a) .",

Within the stage of reflection, strategies adopted to handle the crisis were guided by Aguilera's (1990) problem-solving model for crisis intervention. Finally, learning from reflection is discussed in terms of ethical, personal and aesthetic arenas (Carper 1978 , Johns 1994b Description of the experience Reflection always begins with the 'here and now' description of an experience (Johns 1994a) . The significant background and factors that contributed to the experience are identified. In the early days of SARS outbreak, the tragedy was limited to one epicenter, the Prince of Wales Hospital.

Due to knowledge deficit and uncertainties about SARS infection, as a nurse manager, I was anxious and I felt further stressed in facing my colleagues' negative emotions. I was tempted to escape from the role of leader. Conflict arose when I felt shameful for the thought of escaping and at the same time felt angry regarding my innocence and helplessness. On reflection, I rekindled my sense of courage and responsibility to tackle this great challenge, but I was still overwhelmed by a lack of confidence.

I have learnt the importance of duty-based reasoning and rights-based reasoning in decision-making (Marquis & Huston 1996) . Through the duty-based reasoning, some decisions are made because we have a duty to do something or to refrain from doing something (Marquis & Huston 1996) . I learnt that a leader has a duty to master fear and challenge (Weiland 1998) . And through rights-based reasoning (Marquis & Huston 1996) , I learnt that all nurses have the rights to work in a safe environment. Failure to report the problem of water infiltration to top management would have deprived nurses from their rights for safety needs. Although I worried about the breakdown of my relationship with top management, I was assured that I had made the right decision in reporting the problem of water infiltration and advocating for new water-resistant gowns. This experience reinforces my commitment to follow ethical principles in future practice.",

Honesty was demonstrated by nurses' disclosure of their personal thoughts and feelings. Abstract notions of caring, trust and empathy were exercised through the empowerment of nurses and emotional support to each other. Caring was put into practice by the provision of updated information, provision of PPE and infection control device. The use of silence, touch and the provision of time and space to grieve fostered the establishment of empathy and mutual respect in a nursing team. Furthermore, I gained first-hand experience of the importance of empowerment and team spirit in nursing management. They serve as the most powerful strategies in dealing with the disease, financial constraints, environmental limitations, and emotional distress. Before the SARS outbreak, the art of nursing was just some abstract ideas to me but now it has become my own 'theories in use'.",

The use of reflective practice facilitates myself to analyse the difficult circumstances, and to make meaning out of the experience. In Chinese characters, the term crisis is formed by 'danger' on one side and 'opportunity' on the other side (Weiland 1998) . From the dangerous aspects of the SARS outbreak, SARS infection threatens our physical and emotional health. We suffered from emotional distress with fear of infection and death. We lost one nurse infected with SARS and subsequently another five health care professionals died. From a positive perspective, such a crisis created an opportunity for me to learn and grow. We got the opportunity for better understanding of our values, responsibilities, and personal strengths and weaknesses. Through the process of reflective practice, I acquired practical experiences of the essential qualities and duties of a nurse leader -courage, empowerment, and team building. Team spirit, mutual support, and empathy among nurses are precious experiences for the whole team. These are the most treasured harvests that can go beyond the fear of SARS infection.",
