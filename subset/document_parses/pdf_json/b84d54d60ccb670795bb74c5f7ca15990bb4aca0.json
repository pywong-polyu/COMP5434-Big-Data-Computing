Recent findings Diagnostic and treatment options for managing neurologic emergencies in pregnant patients have expanded with both greater understanding of the effects of imaging modalities and medications on pregnancy and application of standard treatments for non-pregnant patients to pregnant populations. Specifically, this includes cerebrovascular diseases (pregnancy-associated ischemic stroke, pregnancy-associated intracerebral hemorrhage, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis), post-maternal cardiac arrest care, seizures and status epilepticus, myasthenia gravis, and fetal somatic support in maternal death by neurologic criteria. Summary With the exception of direct abdominal computed tomography (CT), most imaging studies are reasonably safe in pregnancy. When emergent imaging is needed to prevent maternal morbidity or mortality, any CT sequence with or without contrast is appropriate to pursue. Though new safety data on antiplatelets, antihypertensives, thrombolytics, and antiepileptic drugs have increased options for disease management in pregnancy, unfractionated and low-molecular weight heparin remain the safest options for anticoagulation. Early studies on hypothermia, ketamine, and immunomodulating therapies in pregnancy are promising. In myasthenia gravis, new data on adjunct devices may allow more patients to undergo safe vaginal delivery, avoiding cesarean section and the associated risk of crisis. When difficult decisions regarding preterm delivery arise, recent outcome studies can help inform discussion. Lastly, when the feared complication of maternal death by neurologic criteria occurs, fetal somatic support may help to save at least one life.",

None has the training to be experts in all aspects of their care. These patients are typically young, healthy, and otherwise at very low risk for critical illness or complications thereof. Furthermore, neurological complications during pregnancy are high-risk, low-occurrence events. If managed well, excellent outcomes for both mother and baby can be achieved, necessitating careful consideration of each treatment decision. Pregnancy is a state in which numerous physiological adaptations evolve to maintain the functions of both mother and fetus. Care of this population requires familiarity with key cardiopulmonary changes among these. During pregnancy, plasma volume expands by 20-100% (average 45%) above baseline which results from a 35-40% decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) which starts as early as week 5 and nadirs in mid second trimester. These changes correspond to a decrease in mean arterial pressure (MAP) by 10-15 mmHg necessitating a reflex increase in heart rate by 10-20 beats per min (bpm) to sustain the increased cardiac output needed to support fetal circulation. Another cause for the increase in heart rate is physiological anemia of pregnancy. Hormones of pregnancy also play an important role in increasing sympathetic and renin-angiotensinogen tone causing a state of hypervolemic hyponatremia. From a pulmonary perspective, progesterone is responsible for inducing a considerable central hyperventilation lowering mean partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO 2 ) down to 28 mmHg. The resulting dyspnea on exertion and peripheral edema compound with pregnancy-induced hypercoagulability to cause some of the most dreaded neurological complications of pregnancy [1, 2] .",

A key tenet of management is to prioritize the outcome of the mother, while minimizing harm to the fetus when possible. Even therapies that carry considerable fetal harm, including fetal demise, may be necessary to satisfy this principle. Exclusion of pregnant women in clinical trials has led to a paucity of evidence to guide complex management decisions of neurological emergencies in pregnant women. Available evidence is mostly limited to small observational studies or recommendations based on expert opinion. Safety concerns, cost considerations, and potential fetal harm of the treatments discussed herein are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. While therapies have been presented along with the pathologies in which they were studied, the same data may inform the safety of broader application to other disease states. Unless specified for a particular medication, dosing is unchanged in pregnancy. In practice, the care of such patients demands close collaboration between experts in neurocritical care, epilepsy, endovascular neurology, obstetrics, neonatology, and neurosurgery in a specialized neuro ICU to optimize outcomes for mother and baby.",

Risks include fetal demise (0-2 weeks), malformation, developmental delay or intellectual disability (2-8 weeks), and increased life-time risk of cancer (anytime). The typical occupational limit for fetal radiation is 5 mGy and fetal risk is negligible up to 50mGy [4, 5\u2022].

Direct anterior-posterior (AP) X-ray of the abdomen has a dose exposure of G 9 mGy. While X-rays are safe in pregnancy, minimization of exposure is still warranted. Limiting X-rays to a single view or obtaining a single partial-chest/partial-abdomen film to confirm the positions of lines and tubes is prudent. Posterior-anterior (PA) views carry one-tenth of the dose 9] . Consultation with the radiologist should occur to ensure all options have been considered and the benefits of the study for the mother outweigh the risks to fetus. With increasing availability of portable CT scanners, it is helpful to be aware of a change in practice away from abdominal shielding and to advocate against it. The practice has been called into question for two reasons. Radiation scatter for imaging areas other than the abdomen and pelvis occurs almost completely through internal tissue transfer. Also, newer CT technology has safety mechanisms for gating exposure based on detected radiation. If that mechanism is interrupted by the lead shield, it could result in a paradoxically higher effective radiation dose experienced by the conceptus [2, 10]. In critically ill patients, the added weight of lead on the gravid uterus may contribute to further discomfort, increased intraabdominal pressure translating to increased intracranial pressure (ICP), or hemodynamic compromise from IVC compression in the supine position.",

Epidemiological studies prior to 1992, when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposed a limit on spatial-peak temporal average intensity of ultrasound transducers of 720mW/cm2, reported a correlation of low birth weight, delayed speech, dyslexia, and non-right handedness with exposure to ultrasound in utero. At this limit, an increase in fetal tissue temperature of up to 2\u00b0C is still possible. With the rise in point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) in ICUs, it is important to understand that the thermal effects are directly proportional to exposure and dwell times. Also, B-mode has the lowest risk of temperature elevation, while color and spectral Doppler have the highest. Lastly, when machines are calibrated for obstetric imaging, the thermal effects are minimized; thus, it is also important when using POCUS to use appropriate settings and pay attention to the thermal and mechanical indices (TI) and (MI) to ensure safe imaging. Ultrasound imaging of the fetus should be performed efficiently by a trained operator and only when medically necessary [3, 5\u2022].",

The fetus excretes it into the amniotic fluid from where it re-ingests and reabsorbs it. The longer the agent persists in amniotic fluid, the more likely it is to become unbound from the chelate raising concern for nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF). A single cohort of 26 women received a clinically recommended dose of GBCA during the first trimester without any mutagenic effects noted. The complications that have been reported are from the retrospective analysis of a Provincial database from Ontario, Canada that reviewed MRI with GBCA exposure versus no MRI exposure during pregnancy in all live births (9 1.4 million) of 20-week gestation or more from 2003 to 2015. GBCA exposure was associated with an increase in NSF-like connective tissue disorders which was not statistically significant. It was also associated with an increased risk of a rheumatological, inflammatory, or infiltrative skin disorders and with still birth or neonatal death which did reach statistical significance [17\u2022] . If performed, the ACR recommends formal documentation of a risk statement in the report. The report should include that the diagnostic question cannot be obtained without the use of IV contrast or another imaging modality, that the information needed affects the care of the mother or conceptus during the course of the pregnancy, and that discussion with the referring physician reveals that it would not be prudent to wait until after delivery [6] . The ACOG recommends that GBCA be limited to situations in which the benefits clearly outweigh the risks [3]. Breast feeding should not be interrupted following GBCA administration as only negligible amounts are excreted into breast milk [3].",

Concerns for potential fetal harm, life-threatening hemorrhage in the mother, and lack of evidence supporting the safety of its use resulted in including pregnancy as a relative contraindication to thrombolytic therapy. However, these large molecules do not cross the placenta. Neither concerns of direct effects of fetal hemorrhage nor teratogeneses are warranted. A review of existing literature found that complication rates for 141 pregnant women treated with IV thrombolysis were no higher than for non-pregnant patients. For PAS specifically, there were 15 articles with a total of 30 patients who received either IV or IA thrombolytics. Urokinase (UK) and alteplase (tPA) were the most frequent agents used.

All 4 of the initial cases resulted in excellent outcomes leading to the 2018 Canadian Best Practice Consensus Statement on Acute Stroke Management in Pregnancy to recommend that pregnancy not be considered a contraindication to angiography. Pregnant women should undergo angiography and MT for disabling stroke without delay [8\u2022\u2022]. The hesitancy in widespread adoption of this practice recommendation is over undue concern for fetal radiation exposure which was recently estimated to be minimal [4] .

            "text": "Women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are considered to be at risk for stroke and seizures. There is little data to guide blood pressure (BP) goals for the various disease states in the neuro ICU during pregnancy. In general, the BP goals of pregnancy should be followed including when considering permissive or therapeutic hypertension whenever feasible. In pregnancy, severe hypertension is defined as 9 or = 160/110 mmHg and is considered and obstetric emergency requiring immediate inpatient care. Initial goal should be to lower BP G 160/110 mmHg. The Control of Hypertension in Pregnancy Study (CHIPS), an international multicenter randomized controlled trial, found that independent of pre-eclampsia (PE), pressures above this threshold were associated with increased maternal length of stay 910 days, pregnancy loss or high level of neonatal care for 948 h, increased risk of preterm birth at both G34-week and G 37-week gestation, low birth weight (G10th percentile), and low maternal platelets and elevate maternal liver enzymes (HELLP). The study also found that untreated BP of 140/90 mmHg or higher increased the incidence of severe hypertension (relative risk 1.8; 95% CI, 1.34-2.28). Therefore, once BP G 160/ 110 mmHg is achieved and neurological indication for hypertension has resolved, careful titration of medication should be made to achieve the goal of G140/90 mmHg. Close monitoring of the blood pressure is needed to avoid episodes of hypotension and low placental perfusion. Continuous fetal monitoring is required to identify early signs of fetal distress [8\u2022\u2022, 57]. Until recently, the ACOG recommended use of IV labetalol or hydralazine as first-line therapy for hypertensive disorders in pregnancy. A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of hydralazine use in pregnancy revealed that mothers treated with hydralazine had a higher number of side effects (RR 1.21, 95% CI, 1.01-1.45) when compared to those treated with either labetalol, nifedipine, ketanserin, diazoxide, urapidil, isradipine, and epoprostenol. Also, infants of mothers treated with hydralazine had lower birth weights (WMD: \u2212135.30, 95% CI: \u2212260.95 to \u22129.65) [58] . Currently labetalol, methyldopa, long-acting nifedipine, and other beta blockers (BB) (metoprolol, pindolol, propranolol, acebutolol) are considered first-line agents, with hydralazine, clonidine, and thiazide diuretics considered second line. The limitation of long-acting nifedipine in the neurocritically ill is the frequent inability to administer medications via oral route. Blood pressure control is less consistent with shortacting nifedipine. Traditionally calcium channel blockers (CCBs) have been considered pregnancy category C. Amlodipine has a long duration of action but can be crushed and given via enteral tubes. Until recently, there were no studies assessing its safety in early pregnancy. Mito and colleagues performed a retrospective review of 231 pregnant women of which 48 were treated with amlodipine during their first trimester. They found no association with first trimester exposure to amlodipine and increased rate of fetal malformations compared with other antihypertensives (54/231) ",

Also, there may be the need for acute discontinuation of antihypertensive effects, not possible with oral medications. In pregnancy, labetalol infusion is considered first line and esmolol and nicardipine infusions, second line. With its risk of cyanide toxicity, nitroprusside should only be considered a last resort [61, 62] . Clevidipine is now considered a first-line antihypertensive infusion for acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke in the non-pregnant population [63] . However, it is designated a pregnancy class C drug, with no literature to date regarding its use in pregnancy. Nicardipine infusion has a rapid onset of action but a 4-6-h duration of action. Since clevidipine is both rapid in onset and elimination from the system (within minutes), it may be considered in rare instances where maternal benefits outweigh potential fetal risks, such as flowlimiting stenosis.",

Indeed, much of the current literature for AEDs focus on women taking daily medication during the first trimester. Many AEDs cross the placenta including levetiracetam (LEV), phenytoin (PHT), and valproate (VPA) [64\u2022\u2022] . In 2019, Tomson compared rates of major congenital malformations with individual AEDs as reported by the North American Antiepileptic Drugs and Pregnancy Registry (2012), UK and Ireland Pregnancy Registry, and the International Registry of Antiepileptic Drugs and Pregnancy (EURAP, 2018). VPA was associated with one of the highest prevalence rates of major congenital malformations (range 6.7-10.3%), while (LEV) had one of the lowest (0.7-2.8%). In 2018, the EURAP registry reported a dose-dependent increase in risk of major malformations for VPA and phenobarbital (PHB), among others. The same study also included the largest reported cohort of in-utero LEV monotherapy exposure and found an overall similar risk profile to low-dose lamotrigine (LTG) exposure [65] . A recent study of 1547 pregnancies, 231 (14.9%) of which did not have AED exposure in the first trimester, demonstrated no significant change in the rate of major congenital malformations if AEDs were increased or added in the second or third trimester [66] . The study also found no statistically significant association between the infants' developmental quotient (DQ) at 1 year of age and AED usage outside of the first trimester, although there was a nonsignificant trend towards a lower DQ with higher doses or the addition of PHB, VPA, and LEV, among others. A recent systematic review and metaanalysis pooled 96 studies with a total of 58,461 patients and reported the odds ratios for overall major congenital malformations, combined fetal losses, prenatal growth retardation, preterm birth, and other specific malformations. Overall, VPA, PHB, and PHT were associated with higher risk for major congenital malformations but LEV was not [67] . Given the physiological changes during pregnancy, therapeutic drug level monitoring should guide dose optimization for all AEDs.",

A shift in the paradigm of post-maternal cardiac arrest (CA) care in pregnancy is needed to improve neurological outcomes in these young patients [79, 80] . Hypothermia is standard of care for supporting neurological recovery post cardiac arrest in the general population. There is no evidence to guide target temperature for hypothermia in neonates, pregnant or postpartum patients. Pre-clinical work, by Ikonomidou et al., suggests that mild, but not moderate, hypothermia significantly reduces neuronal and oligodendrocytic apoptosis following sevoflurane exposure in a macaque model [81] . Of the two human case reports of hypothermia following maternal CA, one resulted in fetal demise of unclear relation to hypothermia (prolonged downtime). The other had good maternal and fetal outcome. Despite absence of trial data, expert consensus recommends consideration of ultra-mild hypothermia (36\u00b0C) in post-maternal CA to avoid further impact on the coagulopathy of pregnancy. The same protocol should be used as for non-pregnant patients [80, 82, IIb] . Typical fetal effects of hypothermia are decreased fetal heart rate and variability. Continuous fetal monitoring is needed [79] . With expansion of hypothermia as a treatment modality in post-maternal CA resuscitation, there is potential for this modality to be extended to other disease pathologies (TBI, stroke, SE) in pregnancy.",

These are rare entities lacking standard recommendations for duration and dosing of medication. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) presents a safe alternative with standard dosing. It is now a preferred treatment for these disorders due to its mitigation of inflammation without causing immunosuppression [27] . IVIG is well tolerated across a wide variety of disease states and may prove beneficial in the treatment of a number of conditions. Chen et al. highlight this prospect in their use of IVIG in their animal model of status epilepticus. They demonstrated decreased microglial activation, reduction in complement component 3 (C3) levels, breakdown of blood-brain barrier, and spontaneous seizures [89] . In humans, the current literature consists of retrospective case reports regarding the use of IVIG for status epilepticus in the general population [90, 91] . Despite the lack of literature in the pregnant population, its safety profile in pregnancy suggests there is no reason to withhold IVIG in pregnant patients in status epilepticus. Another fascinating investigational use of IVIG is as a potential therapeutic option to prevent TORCH syndrome in infants of mothers with a known TORCH infection [92\u2022\u2022] .",

If definitive care can be safely delayed, additional weeks in the ICU to facilitate maximum in utero fetal development can be of considerable benefit depending on gestation age (GA). This can also be applied to certain space-occupying lesions. A recent meta-analysis included 65 studies to determine mean survival rates and rates of survival with and without developmental impairments of extremely premature infants. Mean survival rates increased from 24.1 to 90.2% for infants at 22-week and 27-week GA, respectively. The risk of severe impairment for surviving infants was 36.3% at 22, 14% at 25, and 4.2% at 27-week GA. Alternatively, the chance of survival without impairment for live-born infants increased from 1.2 to 40.6% and 64.2% at 22, 25, and 27-week GA, respectively [94] .

Determining the optimal gestational age for initiating support and the optimal time of gestation in the brain-dead patient are still to be determined [96, 97] . Other unanswered questions are the intricate ethical considerations as to rights and decisional authority over the maternal body. Typically, the main stakeholders in the decisionmaking include the prior known wishes of the brain-dead patient and their families or surrogates [97] . Other areas for consideration include topics that critical care teams tend to overlook, for example, the psychological impact when caring for the dying body of the brain-dead patient. Staff et al. include the nursing staff and midwives in their discussion of this topic. They point out that the physical description of the dying body is often excluded from research in this topic [97] . These previously poorly identified psychological constructs are becoming more apparent as medical teams are forced to confront issues surrounding burnout and compassion fatigue.

The risk of placental abruption exists in the setting of PAS with or without thrombolysis. The possibility of additional risk from this therapy is unknown. The AHA/ASA 2018 AIS Guidelines support consideration of IV tPA administration in pregnancy when the anticipated benefits of treating moderate or severe stroke outweigh the anticipated increased risk of uterine bleeding. This decision should be made based on maternal risk-benefit and personal values expressed by the patient or their designated healthcare proxy [8\u2022\u2022, 36, IIb].",
