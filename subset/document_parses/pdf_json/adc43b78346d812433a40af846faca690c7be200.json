As COVID-19 spreads throughout the world [9] [10] [11] , due to the novelty of the virus and the resulting lack of pharmaceutical options necessary to suppress infection 12 , unprecedented mitigation steps to slow its progression were taken in the form of non-pharmaceutical interventions 3, 13 , e.g., social distancing, mask-wearing, quarantining, and stay-at-home orders. It is largely agreed upon that these slowed the spread of the virus 2, 14 , thereby saving lives. Yet studies have shown that if these active interventions had been enforced even a week earlier 15 , the result would have been a substantial reduction in deaths. As a means of mitigating the spread of COVID-19, the question therefore becomes: when, where, and how does one decide to take non-pharmaceutical interventions?

The most fundamental (and elementary) of these compartmental models is the SIR model, which has recently been used in modeling of COVID-19 24 . Examples of more complex compartmental models applied for COVID-19 include the SEIR 25, 26 and SIRT 27 models, which involve exposed (E) and threatened (T ) populations, and the SIDARTHE model 5 which adds even more compartments. While these models have been found to to be useful when modeling the spread of COVID-19 and the corresponding mitigation procedures, e.g., stay-at-home orders, the approaches are fundamentally based on autonomous dynamics 28, 29 as they do not have a time-varying control input that can dynamically change the evolution of the system.

(which was not certified by peer review) SIR model as a Control System. At the core of our approach is a fundamental shift in perspective on epidemiological models: from viewing them as dynamical systems that evolve in an autonomous fashion, to that of control systems for which the evolution can be dynamically modified. In many ways, this is the de facto manner in which these models are implemented, if only in an implicit fashion, as they are constantly updated as new data is assimilated, e.g., as changes in social distancing are observed, predictive models are updated 30 . We, therefore, will formalize this perspective by making the control aspect of epidemiological models explicit. Note that viewing compartmental epidemiological models as control systems is not unique 31, 32 , but has found only limited application to COVID-19 33 and has yet to enjoy formal guarantees on safety. Additionally, there are examples of control-theoretic concepts being applied, namely in the the context of timevarying 27, 34 and state-varying 6, 35 choices of the transmission rate; these can be viewed as time-and state-varying inputs to a control system. Our approach differs in that we wish to synthesize active intervention policies (i.e., feedback control laws) that will determine future actions to take based upon past observations of the states of the systems.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1308, "end": 1311, "text": "31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "To motivate the methodology utilized throughout this paper, we will begin by considering the fundamental epidemiological compartmental model: the SIR model 21, 23 . Importantly, the approach introduced herein can be applied to any compartmental model, and will subsequently be applied to a more descriptive model. The SIR model consists of a susceptible population S, infected population I, and recovered population R. We can view the evolution of these populations as a control system where active interventions, expressed by the control input u(t), modulate the rate of change of the infected population:\u1e60", "cite_spans": [{"start": 156, "end": 159, "text": "21,", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Control Input S(t)I(t),", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Background"}, {"text": "Here the total population N = S(t)+I(t)+R(t) is constant, \u03b2 0 > 0 is the transmission rate (when no intervention is present) and \u03b3 > 0 is the recovery rate, yielding the reproduction number: R 0 = \u03b2 0 /\u03b3. This model relates to the traditional SIR model via the time-varying transmission rate \u03b2(t) = \u03b2 0 (1 \u2212 u(t)). Time-varying \u03b2(t) has been considered 20 ; for example, we can utilize the policy u(t) = \u2212A cos(\u03c9t) in the SIR model 36 to recover models of seasonal variations in infection 37 . In the setting considered here, taking u(t) \u2261 0 corresponds to no intervention, yielding the traditional SIR model with \u03b2(t) \u2261 \u03b2 0 , whereas u(t) \u2261 1 can be viewed as maximum intervention, full and complete quarantine of the population. In the latter case the infected population decays to zero exponentially, I(t) = e \u2212\u03b3t I(0), since the susceptible population is isolated. These effects can be seen, for example, in the Chinese response to COVID-19 and the corresponding drop in R 0 documented 19 . Figure 1 .

The time delay \u03c4 = 10 days is highlighted to emphasize that the observed data corresponds to the delayed counterparts of the populations, and this delay also appears in the active intervention policy: u(t) = A(S(t \u2212 \u03c4 ), I(t \u2212 \u03c4 )), given in Eq.

The blue arrow represents the time dependent modulation of the transmission rate \u03b2(t). The control input u(t) is estimated from mobility data 38 in the US between March 2 and May 20, 2020 by assuming u = 0 at the beginning this period when no non-pharmaceutical interventions were present. Furthermore, the parameters \u03b2 0 , \u03b3 and N of the SIR model were fitted to the recorded number of confirmed cases: I(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) + R(t \u2212 \u03c4 ). Fitting for the time delay \u03c4 , in the corresponding transmission rate \u03b2(t \u2212 \u03c4 ), reveals that the COVID-19 data 39 depicted publicly 40 are delayed by \u03c4 \u2248 10 days. This time delay originates from the incubation time of the virus (i.e., people are being infectious before being symptomatic) and the time needed for testing 33, 41, 42 . That is, the data corresponds the number of confirmed cases \u03c4 days ago while the real current number could be much higher. For example, in mid-March, when interventions were introduced in the US, I(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) + R(t \u2212 \u03c4 ) was reported to be in the range of a few thousand, while the real number I(t) + R(t) is estimated to be more than a hundred thousand. This delay also appears in the active intervention policies which depend on the state of the system, i.e., u(t) = A(S(t \u2212 \u03c4 ), I(t \u2212 \u03c4 )), and it therefore must be compensated for in order to ensure the safety of these policies. Finally, we remark that when fitting the model (1) to the aforementioned data one may obtain good fits while setting N in the range from 7.5 million up to 330 million (see the Methods section for additional details). Smaller values encode the fact that not everyone susceptible is necessarily exposed when the total number of infected is small relative to the total population, as well as the fact that the total number of infections is underreported 43 .

Our goal is to synthesize active intervention policies so as to achieve desired safety-critical behaviors, that is, to guarantee that the system, with the policy applied, evolves in a safe fashion. Concretely, we may quantify safety in the context of the SIR model as limiting the total number of infected persons: I(t) \u2264 I max .

This highlights that interventions only become \"active\" when safety is in danger of being violated. However, if one simply uses the obtained feedback control law in the SIR model with time delay \u03c4 , i.e., substitutes u(t) = A(S(t \u2212 \u03c4 ), I(t \u2212 \u03c4 )) into Eq. (1), safety cannot be ensured due to the delay. In order to compensate for this delay we construct predictors 48 (as described in Methods) and use the predicted states S p (t) and I p (t) in the active intervention policy: u(t) = A(S p (t), I p (t)). If the predictions are accurate, i.e., S p (t) = S(t) and I p (t) = I(t), then the delay-free control design can ensure safety. Such predictors play an essential role in making the active intervention policies, synthesized from control barrier functions, implementable in the presence of time delay 8 . (1) while compensating for the 10 days delay using predictors. The control barrier function is able to keep the infected population under I max = 200, 000 while gradually driving the control input (active intervention) to zero, i.e., mitigation methods can eventually be removed. Notice that this opening strategy decreases the control input very slowly at the beginning followed by a faster opening toward the end. As a reference we also show the results of another opening strategy where the control input is reduced to zero linearly in time. In this case the number of infections peaks at a much higher value putting a large burden on the health system. While this figure vividly illustrates the use of safety-critical active intervention, and the benefits thereof, it also predicts that all restrictions can be lifted by mid-July. This is due to the use of the simplified SIR model that was considered to illustrate the concepts presented and, more specifically, due to the fact that the model heavily depends on the N (chosen to be 7.5 million when fitting the data).

Different states require different levels of mitigation as highlighted by the color of each state. The gating criterion for state level mitigation was, as a proof of concept, determined by the value of the safety-critical control input 30 days after the start of active intervention; other criterion could be used based upon public policy. In this case, Michigan may open up, i.e., relax its mitigation efforts relatively quickly, reducing the control input to less than 50% of its current value in 30 days, yet mitigation efforts must be kept in place throughout the year. Qualitatively similar behavior can be seen in the case of New York, though active interventions cannot be reduced as quickly-if relaxed too quickly the result is a second spike in infections equal to the first already experienced. By comparison, California needs to very slowly relax its mitigation efforts and settle into a steady state mitigation at 80% of its current value, or the result is an outbreak with very high number of hospitalized and substantially more death. Texas should increase its current mitigation efforts to avoid a sudden and significant rise of infections, hospitalizations and death.

The safety-critical approach to active intervention can directly inform public policy. To wit, the results presented demonstrate that epidemiological models (viewed as control systems) can capture the role of human action in mitigating COVID-19; both to describe observed data, and to actively modulate future behavior. Active intervention policies (feedback control laws) can, therefore, be used to guide non-pharmaceutical actions that should be taken to achieve a desired outcome with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic-or unforeseen future pandemics. Of particular concern are mitigation efforts devoted to ensuring safety; this encodes the desire to limit the infected, hospitalized and deceased population. The safety-critical active intervention policy presented herein results in concrete guidance on future mitigation efforts needed to achieve these guarantees. These actions can be at a local, state, national or international level depending on the ability to guide active interventions among these populations. The end result can be codified in tangible and specific public policies on \"opening up\", i.e., on lifting or increasing mitigation efforts.

In this policy, there are two constants to be chosen: the maximum number of hospitalizations H max , and the maximum number of deceased D max . The value of H max for each state was chosen to be the last fitted hospitalization value (i.e., the last point of the blue curves in Figs. 4 and 9 ) to prevent hospitalizations from getting worse than the most recent recorded data.

Note that the five states with a significantly smaller \u03c4 have values shifted by roughly one week from the average, due to the cyclical nature of the data.", "latex": null, "type": "table", "html": "<html><body><table><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>Parameters\n</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td><td>\u00a0</td></tr><tr><td>\u00a0</td><td>N(%) </td><td>\u03b20 </td><td>\u03b3 </td><td>\u03bb </td><td>\u00b5 </td><td>\u03bd </td><td>\u03b10 </td><td>\u03b11 </td><td>\u03c4\n</td></tr><tr><td>USA </td><td>4.01 </td><td>0.57 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.14 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.39 </td><td>0.16 </td><td>0.39 </td><td>14\n</td></tr><tr><td>CA </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.57 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.26 </td><td>0.31 </td><td>0.26 </td><td>15\n</td></tr><tr><td>MI </td><td>5.71 </td><td>0.44 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.04 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.34 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>NY </td><td>4.28 </td><td>0.60 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.08 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.27 </td><td>0.12 </td><td>0.46 </td><td>14\n</td></tr><tr><td>TX </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.37 </td><td>0.20 </td><td>0.04 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.09 </td><td>0.23 </td><td>0.15 </td><td>15\n</td></tr><tr><td>AR </td><td>9.18 </td><td>0.44 </td><td>0.20 </td><td>0.15 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.34 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>CO </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.61 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.21 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.37 </td><td>0.23 </td><td>0.38 </td><td>13\n</td></tr><tr><td>CT </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.63 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.03 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.38 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>15\n</td></tr><tr><td>DE </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.50 </td><td>0.12 </td><td>0.23 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>14\n</td></tr><tr><td>IA </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.54 </td><td>0.20 </td><td>0.17 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.39 </td><td>0.14 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>IL </td><td>4.68 </td><td>0.45 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.31 </td><td>0.35 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>KY </td><td>10.00 </td><td>0.50 </td><td>0.14 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.26 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>8\n</td></tr><tr><td>LA </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.48 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.33 </td><td>0.34 </td><td>0.14 </td><td>15\n</td></tr><tr><td>MA </td><td>8.32 </td><td>0.60 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.38 </td><td>0.33 </td><td>0.27 </td><td>13\n</td></tr><tr><td>Region MN </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.56 </td><td>0.15 </td><td>0.22 </td><td>0.03 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.16 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>MO </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.42 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.20 </td><td>0.32 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>12\n</td></tr><tr><td>MT </td><td>4.03 </td><td>0.33 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.23 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.34 </td><td>0.23 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>8\n</td></tr><tr><td>NC </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.63 </td><td>0.17 </td><td>0.18 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.32 </td><td>0.31 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>ND </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.38 </td><td>0.20 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.28 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>5\n</td></tr><tr><td>NJ </td><td>7.43 </td><td>0.71 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.19 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.37 </td><td>0.28 </td><td>0.43 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>NM </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.58 </td><td>0.20 </td><td>0.19 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.39 </td><td>0.19 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>PA </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.57 </td><td>0.07 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.38 </td><td>0.33 </td><td>0.23 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>RI </td><td>8.79 </td><td>0.60 </td><td>0.20 </td><td>0.14 </td><td>0.01 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.36 </td><td>0.24 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>VA </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.77 </td><td>0.17 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.26 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.37 </td><td>16\n</td></tr><tr><td>VT </td><td>10.00 </td><td>0.54 </td><td>0.20 </td><td>0.23 </td><td>0.03 </td><td>0.26 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.14 </td><td>14\n</td></tr><tr><td>WA </td><td>10.00 </td><td>0.57 </td><td>0.16 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.03 </td><td>0.34 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.17 </td><td>8\n</td></tr><tr><td>WI </td><td>10.00 </td><td>0.50 </td><td>0.14 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.31 </td><td>0.40 </td><td>0.10 </td><td>5\n</td></tr><tr><td>WV </td><td>4.00 </td><td>0.58 </td><td>0.14 </td><td>0.25 </td><td>0.02 </td><td>0.23 </td><td>0.35 </td><td>0.22 </td><td>16\n</td></tr></table></body></html>"}}, "back_matter": [{"text": "Acknowledgements The authors would like to thank Franca Hoffmann for her insights into compartmental epidemiological models and G\u00e1bor St\u00e9p\u00e1n for discussions regarding non-pharmaceutical interventions in Europe.
