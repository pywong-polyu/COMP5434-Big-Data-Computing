While epidemiological data show that COVID-19 in children is not as common as in adults, the incidence of pediatric cases in Indonesia has accelerated [3] . e clinical manifestations of COVID-19 in pediatric patients are variable and range from asymptomatic to acute upper respiratory tract infection, gastrointestinal symptoms with shock, as well as coagulation disorders in severe cases [4] . e risk of severe disease tends to be higher in infants and children with comorbidities or underlying conditions [5] . Existing studies have shown that pediatric patients tend to develop asymptomatic to mild diseases and are less likely to require intensive care or other adjuvant therapies that are indicated for those with severe clinical manifestations [6, 7] . e clinical presentation and epidemiological characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are variable and relatively unclear. It is challenging to diagnose COVID-19 based on its clinical presentation, especially as Indonesia has a high burden of major infectious and tropical diseases, such as malaria and dengue fever [8] .",

Patients who live outside the capital region with limited resources may have to wait even longer for these results compared to those in the capital region [9, 10] . Laboratory results in pediatric COVID-19 cases have shown lower hemoglobin levels and higher white blood cell counts in some studies, although other abnormal laboratory findings are not specific to this disease [3, 11] . ese diagnostic limitations in clinical patterns may lead to a challenge in the early recognition of COVID-19 in children [12] .",

Based on WHO guidelines, our hospital screened all patients admitted to the emergency room and clinic during the pandemic. Patients with clinical symptoms consistent with suspected or probable COVID-19 diagnostic criteria were admitted to the isolation ward. Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were performed at the emergency room or clinic by trained physicians, and were subsequently delivered to the laboratory to be examined for RT-PCR of SARS-CoV-2. A diagnosis of COVID-19 was established following a positive RT-PCR test. In the event of uncertainty in the diagnosis, an expert in new-emerging and reemerging diseases was consulted to determine whether the clinical presentation of the patient is consistent for suspected or probable COVID-19 criteria.",

Epidemiological criteria for diagnosis included: (1) residing or working in an area with a high risk of viral transmission of or closed residential settings any time within 14 days prior to symptom onset; (2) residing or traveling to an area with community transmission anytime within the 14 days before symptom onset; or (3) working in any healthcare setting within 14 days before symptom onset [13] . After applying the diagnostic criteria, the diagnosis of COVID-19 was confirmed using the RT-PCR test. For each patient, at least two consecutive RT-PCR tests were performed to increase the sensitivity. Patients who tested positive in the RT-PCR test were classified into the confirmed COVID-19 group (group A), and patients who tested negative were classified into the non-COVID-19 group (group B). In this study, travel history was defined as residing or traveling to an area with community transmission any time within 14 days prior to symptom onset, and contact history was defined as direct contact or being in a proximity of within 1 metre for at least 15 minutes with a confirmed COVID-19 patient or previous exposure to a healthcare facility.",

Numerous studies have indicated that most pediatric patients with COVID-19 have a history of traveling to epidemic regions, while some have a history of close contact with other confirmed COVID-19 patients [17, 18] . A study of 24 confirmed COVID-19 children in Taiwan reported that 20 patients (83.8%) had a travel history, while the remaining 4 had a definite direct or indirect contact history with someone who had travelled to another country in the recent past [3] . erefore, preventive procedures such as use of masks or face shields, physical distancing, and hand hygiene procedures still remain as the most important aspects in preventing the transmission of COVID-19. However, there are also cases of pediatric COVID-19 patients with no apparent history of exposure. erefore, even when there is no definite epidemiological history, it is suggested that COVID-19 should not be excluded entirely in children, especially those who live in a region with high positivity rates such as Indonesia, and this must be comprehensively evaluated by taking into consideration other symptoms or examination results. is study found that the most common symptoms were fever, followed by nonspecific symptoms of the upper respiratory tract such as cough, as well as abdominal pain. Other studies have also shown that children with COVID-19 present with a fever and dry cough as the most common clinical manifestations [17] [18] [19] . A systematic review reported the most prevalent COVID-19 symptoms in children were fever (47.5%), cough (41.5%), nasal symptoms (11.2%), diarrhea (8.1%), and nausea/vomiting (7.1%) [20] . Greater upper airway resistance in children causes aerosol particles to be more easily deposited in the tracheobronchial tree as opposed to the alveoli, which leads to more bronchiolitis-like infections compared to pneumonia in children with SARS-CoV-2 [21] . Diarrhea may also appear as a symptom since the viral receptor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) was found in the epithelial cells of the small intestine, indicating that SARS-CoV-2 can actively infect and replicate in the GI tract [22] . Abdominal pain was also a notable finding suggestive for COVID-19, and this symptom was mainly found in those presenting with diarrhea. Another study also reported that SARS-CoV-2 RNA was still detected in rectal swabs even after seroconversion of nasopharyngeal swab test results [23] . Determining the possible differential diagnosis can therefore be challenging, particularly in an endemic country with various tropical infectious diseases and common viral infections.",
