Through collection of 2132 questionnaire responses in field research, the present researchers analyzed the data using descriptive statistics and various approaches. In conclusion, the public's high level of willingness to share information, sufficient knowledge of and consensus on epidemic prevention between individuals and families, strict compliance with relevant regulations, effective preventive measures, and adequate public facilities have contributed to control of COVID-19. However, vigilance and awareness of the pandemic in some individuals, epidemic-prevention campaigns, and community-based preventive measures were insufficient. Some citizens subsequently suffered from headaches, anxiety, and mood instability. Furthermore, demographic variables (place of residence, sex, age, and occupation) and physical and mental health status produced various effects on citizens' awareness, attitude, and behavior regarding epidemic prevention as well as the perceived effect of COVID-19 on physical and mental health.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was first discovered in Wuhan, China, although the origins of the virus remain unknown. After the first case was confirmed on 26 December 2019 in Wuhan, the virus rapidly spread, causing a global pandemic. On 9 April 2020, the accumulated number of confirmed cases in China reached 83,249 with a death toll of 3344 in 105 days [1, 2] . The daily number of confirmed cases and deaths averaged 826 and 31.8, respectively, indicating the severity of the COVID-19 pandemic. Presently, the pandemic has affected 183 countries with 1,457,989 confirmed cases and 86,730 deaths worldwide [3] . With a mortality rate of 5.95% [4] , the virus can damage pulmonary alveoli, leading to respiratory failure and death in severe cases. Currently, the origin of COVID-19 is unknown. COVID-19 can live in the air for a long time, and infected individuals with and without symptoms can both spread the disease [5] . In addition, the transmission of this virus remains unclear. COVID19, the global economy has been substantially affected [6, 7] ; the pandemic's severity and the damage subsequently caused are difficult to estimate. Figure 1 illustrates the regions affected by COVID-19 worldwide and in Taiwan. Despite its proximity to China, Taiwan has successfully controlled COVID-19 because of its geographical advantages and experience gained from the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome. Since the disease outbreak on January 21, 2020, the Taiwanese government has actively adopted various measures to contain the virus spread [8] , instructed its citizens in how to protect themselves, controlled the healthcare supply chain, and encouraged academic institutions to develop antiviral drugs. By April 9, 79 days after the first case was identified, the accumulated numbers of confirmed cases and deaths were 379 and 5, respectively [9] , averaging 4.7 cases and 0.06 deaths per day. These figures are substantially lower than those in China, where the number of confirmed cases is 175.74 times the number in Taiwan and the number of deaths 5,300 times the number in Taiwan. The numbers of confirmed cases and deaths in Taiwan rank 70th and 92nd, respectively among the 183 affected countries (including developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries) [10] .

Under such circumstances, the country has the ability to withstand tangible and intangible pressures resulting from the pandemic, respond to global challenges, and adopt appropriate epidemic prevention measures. To assess awareness of epidemic prevention, citizens' knowledge-including individual, family, and community health awareness and compliance with government instructions [13, 16] -can be observed, along with the country's relevant measures and emergency responses, including notifications on protective measures [15] . Attitudes toward the disease can be determined through observation of individuals' perceptions and explicit reactions [17] [18] [19] , such as their vigilance and research in relation to epidemic prevention and health [15] . One can determine individuals' behaviors in relation to the disease by evaluating their adaptability and personal conduct during the pandemic [20] , [21] . For example, research can examine citizens' vigilance regarding epidemic prevention, their hygiene, their problem-solving skills, and public information [15] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 33, "end": 36, "text": "19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 364, "end": 367, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 368, "end": 370, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 617, "end": 620, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 654, "end": 657, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 929, "end": 932, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1059, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1062, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1562, "end": 1565, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1867, "end": 1870, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2291, "end": 2295, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2441, "end": 2445, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3215, "end": 3218, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 3520, "end": 3523, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 3943, "end": 3947, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 4093, "end": 4097, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 4496, "end": 4499, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 4801, "end": 4804, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 5225, "end": 5229, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 5375, "end": 5379, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 6210, "end": 6214, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 6215, "end": 6219, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 6220, "end": 6224, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 6225, "end": 6229, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 6613, "end": 6617, "text": "[13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 6618, "end": 6621, "text": "16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 6755, "end": 6759, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 6880, "end": 6884, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 6885, "end": 6889, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 6890, "end": 6894, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 6980, "end": 6984, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 7129, "end": 7133, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 7136, "end": 7140, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 7296, "end": 7300, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1151, "end": 1159, "text": "Figure 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 2448, "end": 2456, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 4100, "end": 4108, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}, {"start": 5382, "end": 5390, "text": "Figure 2", "ref_id": "FIGREF1"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Citizens must maintain their health to achieve epidemic prevention [22] .
