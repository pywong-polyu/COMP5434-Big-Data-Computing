The vast majority of fact-checking studies focus exclusively on political claims. Very little research explores fact-checking for other topics, specifically subject matters for which expertise is required. We present the first study of explainable fact-checking for claims which require specific expertise. For our case study we choose the setting of public health. To support this case study we construct a new dataset PUBHEALTH of 11.8K claims accompanied by journalist crafted, gold standard explanations (i.e., judgments) to support the fact-check labels for claims 1 . We explore two tasks: veracity prediction and explanation generation. We also define and evaluate, with humans and computationally, three coherence properties of explanation quality. Our results indicate that, by training on in-domain data, gains can be made in explainable, automated fact-checking for claims which require specific expertise.",

However, a few blind spots exist in the state-of-the-art. In this work we address specifically two shortcomings: the narrow focus on political claims, and the paucity of explainable systems.",

Recent events, including the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrate the significant potential harm of misinformation in the public health setting, and the importance in accurately fact-checking claims. Unlike political and general misinformation, specific expertise is required in order to fact check claims in this domain. Oftentimes this expertise may be limited, and thus claims which surround public health may be inaccessible (e.g., because of the use of jargon and biomedical terminology) in a way political claims are not. Nonetheless, like political misinformation, the public health variety is also potentially very dangerous, because it can put people in imminent danger and risk lives.",

However, our work differs from the existing literature as we construct a framework for joint extractive and abstractive explanation generation, as opposed to a purely extractive model. We choose an abstractive approach as we hypothesize that particularly in the case of public health claims, where specific expertise is required to understand the context, abstractive explanations can make the explanation more accessible, particularly for those with little knowledge of the subject matter. In this way we take into account the nature of the claims, something other explainable fact-checking systems do not consider.",

Indeed, it would be difficult to label the veracity of the claim in this type of entries. On the other hand, fact-check and news claims, which were associated with 141 different veracity labels, did require compression. We standardized the original labels for 4-way classification (see Appendix A.1). The cho-sen 4 labels are true, false, mixture, and unproven. We discounted claims with labels that cannot be reduced to one of these 4 labels. The distribution of labels in the final PUBHEALTH is shown in Table 2 . The dataset consists of a majority false claims. Unproven claims are the least common in the dataset. The second step in processing the data was to remove claims with no biomedical context. This step was especially crucial for the claims which originated from fact-checking websites where the bulk of fact-checks concern political and economic claims. Health claims are easier to acquire from news websites, such as Reuters, as they can be quickly identified by the section of the website in which they were located during the data collection process. Although we mentioned that a sizeable number of claims from fact-checking sources are re-lated to political events, some are connected to both political and health events or other mixed health context, and we collected claims whose subject matter intersects other topics in order to obtain a subject-rich dataset (see Appendix A.1).",

Table 3 shows the Flesch-Kincaid (Kincaid et al., 1975) and Dale-Chall (Chall and Dale, 1995) readability evaluations of claims from our fact-checking dataset when compared to four other fact-checking datasets. The results show that PUBHEALTH claims are, on average, the most challenging to read. Claims from our dataset have a mean Flesch-Kincaid reading ease score of 59.1, which corresponds to a 10th-12th grade reading level and fairly difficult to read. The other fact-checking datasets have reading levels which fit into the 6th, 7th and 8th grade categories. Similarly for the Dale-Chall readability metric, on average our claims are more difficult to understand. Our claims have a mean score of 9.5 which is equivalent to the reading age of college student, whereas all other datasets' claims have an average score which indicates that they are readable by 10th to 12th grade students. Both these results support our earlier assertion about the complexity of public health claims relative to political and more general claims. In this section we describe in detail the methods we employed for devising automated fact-checking models. We trained two fact-checking models: a classifier for veracity prediction, and a second summarization model for generating fact-checking explanations. The former returns the probability of an input claim text belonging to one of four classes: true, false, unproven, mixture. The latter uses a form of joint extractive and abstractive summarization to generate explanations for the veracity of claims from article text about the claims. Full details of hyperparameters chosen and computer infrastructure which was employed can be found in Appendix A.2.",

Table 7 shows the origin fact-checking explanations included in the PUBHEALTH dataset. In Table 8 we show examples of the subject-rich tags scraped alone with the claims. Table 9 shows the mapping between the standardized and original veracity labels.Building the public health lexicon. In order to compile the lexicon we scraped health related terms from the following website sources. In total we scraped vocabulary from a number of pages across six websites. These websites are NHS Health A-Z, 10 Everyday Health, 11 Medline Plus, 12 Think Local, Act Personal, 13 National Careers Healthcare Job, 14 and the Mayo Clinic. 15",
