This study examines the frequency and causes for patients upgraded to intensive care unit (ICU) level care following admission from the emergency department (ED) to non-critical care units. Methods: The number of ICU upgrades per month was determined, including the percentage of upgrades noted to have non-concordant diagnoses. Charts with non-concordant diagnoses were examined in detail as to the ED medical decision-making, clinical circumstances surrounding the upgrade, and presence of a diagnosis of COVID-19. For each case, a cognitive bias was assigned. Results: The percentage of upgraded cases with non-concordant diagnoses increased from a baseline range of 14-20% to 41.3%. The majority of upgrades were due to premature closure (72.2%), anchoring (61.1%), and confirmation bias (55.6%). Conclusion: Consistent with the behavioral literature, this suggests that stressful ambient conditions affect cognitive reasoning processes.",

They also encountered emotional stress from interacting with unprecedented levels of human suffering and the fears of personally contracting this dangerous, highly contagious disease.

Charts were abstracted for Early Warning Score, qSOFA score, vital sign trends and admission and discharge diagnoses. Patients with stable vital signs, low-risk, non-deteriorating EWS and qSOFA, and no change in diagnosis were considered to have been upgraded for progression of illness. Patients with high EWS or qSOFA 2 or 3, or trending deterioration of vital signs were considered as possible cases of patients who might have been directly admitted to ICU. Those cases then were further evaluated individually for diagnostic concordance independently by a team of one senior EM attending and one EM fellow. Non-concordant diagnosis was defined as a change in primary diagnosis after the upgrade that could have been effected by a change in EM management.

Prior to COVID-19, non-concordant diagnosis, in which the admission diagnosis differed from primary diagnosis at point of upgrade, or at hospital discharge, was the etiology in 20.1% of all upgrades. In contrast, during the 4-month period beginning March 2020 at the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, non-concordant diagnosis-related ICU upgrades were found to be 41.3%. This unexpected finding prompted focused review of the same 4-month period in 2019, which found 14.3% nonconcordant diagnosis during the matched period. Though the number of patients was small, it was significantly different, and it was in marked contrast to what had been consistent findings on prior monthly review. This raised the question of whether or not the pandemic was associated with changed patterns of medical decision-making.",

As Croskerry points out, the EM physician may make thousands of decisions in a single shift, a density of decision-making greater than any other specialty, possibly greater than that of any other profession. A commentary by Pines suggests that increased ED crowding, resulting in a higher percentage of admissions, might imply less analytic effort in context of patient overload [9] . Greater load of decision-making, that is, may trigger increased use of cognitive short cuts. Neurobiological studies suggest that acute stress affects cognition through activation of the adrenergic axis, whereas ongoing stress tends to involve cortisol levels, with less beneficial effect on decision-making [10] . It may be that unaccustomed high levels of stress day after day challenge executive function via persistently elevated cortisol levels.",

The abrupt increased frequency cannot be ascribed to increased patient load, as the number of treated patients decreased by more than 30% during this 4-month interval. With COVID-19 on the forefront of everyone's minds, anchoring and availability bias were likely at play. However, there was less overdiagnosis of COVID-19 than might have been expected. Confirmation bias, in which findings inconsistent with the presumptive diagnosis were ignored, was seen as well, and notably more than in the previous year. Studies of stress effects on decision-making suggest tendencies toward rigid thinking, less analysis and less creativity, as perhaps might manifest in premature closure and confirmation bias. Previous studies have also demonstrated that premature closure is one of the most common causes of diagnostic error [11] .",

At this institution, early aggressive systems modifications and cooperation between ED physicians, hospitalists and intensivists, maintained ED patient flow. However, the change in ED volumes and amount of available time and resources would have also impacted both the ED patient population and the ED physicians' ability to respond to those patients. The impact of this is also challenging to quantify. While this study focuses on decision-making of ED physicians, all admissions were, in fact, cooperative decisions between ED and inpatient physicians. ICU upgrades involve patients with abrupt clinical deterioration and momentum bias on the part of admitting physicians may have been at play. The clinical spectrum of disease differed from prepandemic experience, with the majority of admissions being those of COVID-19 or suspected COVID-19. In that regard, it is striking that ICU upgrades involved majority non-COVID-19 patients.",

An atypically large percentage of upgrades were found to have change in diagnosis after admission from the ED. Furthermore, the pattern of those upgrades also changed in the early months of COVID-19. Cognitive biases at play seemed to trend toward premature closure, consistent with psychobiological work that has implied stress-induced tendency toward impulsive decision-making. More work remains to be done to further evaluate the relationship between the pandemic, stress, cognitive bias, and decision making. Each case was reviewed and assigned most relevant cognitive biases based on pre-determined definitions. Anchoring, confirmation bias, and premature closure were present in the majority of cases, while the availability heuristic was present in only 16.7%.",
