            "text": "This movement began as a response to an extradition bill put forward by the Hong Kong government, which would allow for the transfer of fugitives outside of Hong Kong to territories where Hong Kong does not have extradition agreements, including the Mainland China and Taiwan. Protests began due to concerns that the bill could allow people from Hong Kong to be subjected to the legal system of China. Due to police reactions, and public perceptions of excessive use of tear gas, the movement picked up speed and coalesced around core concerns of pro-democracy members of the society, demanding more openness and democratic processes in society among other things (Li 2015; Kuo 2019) . and safe during scheduled protests. Chat groups became protest information logs. We started chatting more, socializing less. Every trip through the airport had to be planned meticulously. We began travelling to the airport 4 or 5 hours early, despite travel time and security checks never taking more than half an hour, in case of complications. Most of my classes had to be made optional or end early, as trains across the region were often shut down early in the day, allegedly to repair damages, but more likely to discourage protests. Many students became uncertain of when and if they could come to classes in this case.",

On a Monday morning, I was working in my office when my partner and some colleagues started warning me to get off campus, fast. Looking out my window and down the hall, I felt sceptical. It seemed quiet. I then learned that protestors had barricaded all entrances and exits to campus, trapping students and staff where they were. I tried to make my way home, before being stopped by a group of young men in black shirts (protestors): 'You cannot go this way'. As my campus is at the base of Hong Kong's Victoria Peak, I plotted a new way out, involving a kilometre's hike around the mountain, with stairs heading down to a main road off campus, from which I could walk home. I took the route with a few science professors I knew, also anxious for any exit.",

My social life was lived fully online in chat groups with friends, who also reported what they could see from their windows and when they walked in their neighbourhoods. A few days later, I crept onto campus, to see it transformed by damages: broken glass, graffiti everywhere, barricades of broken furniture, and broken elevators and escalators, making it difficult to navigate. The road outside my apartment, a major thoroughfare, was artfully barricaded each evening, so that it was unusable each morning, preventing the 'business as usual' many in Hong Kong had been wanting for 6 long months.",

I had two flights cancelled and changed, before I decided not to go. At that point, the USA had few cases. Yet I knew from past experience that I lived in the future. I remembered that during the Hong Kong protests, my friends and colleagues elsewhere around the world were usually fairly oblivious to what was going on in Hong Kong, only paying attention well after the fact. That few friends or family members had even asked if I was okay while Asian countries were scrambling to avoid an epidemic made me concerned that it was just a matter of time until the western world woke up to Covid-19. I also heard stories of people in the states asking for tests and not receiving them, since the virus was still being associated with travel to China, while the lack of local testing only helped maintain a sense of denial about the existence of local community transmission. So I worried about my trip. What if I caught a cold and had to see a doctor in the USA? What if travel bans changed, and I got stuck in Pittsburgh, or not let back into Hong Kong? Although I probably could have taken the trip and returned to Hong Kong safely, it seemed more responsible at that stage to cancel my trip. Now there is not a conference that has not been cancelled in the future.",

Living in the future, we see that far too much of it was easily preventable. Why did not our friends and family listen to us, about social distancing and self-quarantine, about cancelling in-person classes, before things got worse? Did they think they were immune to the problems of Asia? Did they imagine they are in the developed countries, with the best healthcare in the world, while their lead politicians encourage needless loss of life, as apparently necessary for their economies? Now there are all kinds of offensive speculations, about how obedient Asians are, as if that is why Singapore, Taiwan, and Hong Kong have been pulling through. In Hong Kong, this is far from the truth. Yet those in the western world keep ignoring the experiences of those of in Asia, clinging indirectly to a kind of nationalism closed off to the rest of the world. 4 Now, new jokes in the western world about self-quarantine fall on our deaf earsworse, memes, and photos of their lives lived newly at home sting, as we in Hong Kong marvel over the giant homes and apartments people suddenly feel trapped in, back west. While it is all new to my friends in the west, it feels like we have always been self-quarantining and working from home. Easter holidays are cancelled. Summer holidays are most likely cancelled. Now the whole world is coming to the same page, wondering about life at the end of the year-and the economy and education, as we know it. As a leader of one academic society and a guide to many students and colleagues at this time, I find that my answers to questions about future conferences and activities are not as hopeful as some people would like: Wait and see. Do not spin yourself in circles needlessly. Prioritize sanity, self-care, and community care. Never mind all the things you used to do and thought you would do now.",
