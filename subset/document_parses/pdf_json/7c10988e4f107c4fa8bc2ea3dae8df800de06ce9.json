Previously, a DNA vaccine encoding a 15 kDa sandfly (Phlebotomus papatasi) salivary protein (PpSP15) and recombinant nonpathogenic Leishmania tarentolae secreting PpSP15 have been shown to induce protective immunity against Leishmania major in mice, demonstrating that PpSP15 is a promising vaccine candidate.

The biophysical/biochemical analysis of the purified PpSP15 indicated that the protein was of high purity (>97%) and conformationally stable between pH 4.4 and 9.0.

The low polydispersity (<8%) further indicated that the protein was monodispersed (Fig. 2c ). To further assess the level of any potential aggregation, SE-HPLC was also used. The results (Fig. 2d ) indicated that PpSP15 eluted as a single peak at 20.8 min, slightly later than the retention time of the 17 kDa protein standard (20.0 min) from a well-resolved Bio-Rad gel filtration standard, suggesting the size of PpSP15 was likely slightly less than 17 kDa.

In this study, we have generated a recombinant P. pastoris X33 construct for recombinant PpSP15 protein production, developed and optimized an upstream process at the 10 L scale, and developed a scalable downstream process consisting of IEX and HIC chromatographic steps. The purified PpSP15 was characterized by various biochemical and biophysical assays, and a more suitable pH range to stabilize PpSP15 was determined.

First, the conductivity of FS was lowered by diafiltration. To reduce processing time, a 10 kDa cutoff Pellicon\u00ae 3 cassette was being tested; however, PpSP15 was found to permeate through the cassette, and thus, a 3 kDa cutoff Pellicon\u00ae 3 cassette was selected. However, instead of direct diafiltration, the FS was first concentrated 3-fold to (1) reduce the processing time required for diafiltration and cation exchange chromatography and (2) lower the volume of buffer required for diafiltration. PpSP15 in this concentrated and buffer-exchanged FS was further purified with a 14.5 cm BH IEX column at a flow rate of 149.3 cm/h using a step elution at 30% elution buffer. An additional elution step with a linear gradient from 30% to 100% elution buffer was applied to remove the bound host cell protein in the column after the target protein had been recovered. However, because gradient elution is undesirable in large-scale production, we plan to replace this step with a step elution with 100% elution buffer in future scale-up experiments. After the IEX step, it was noticed that approximately 7% of low-molecular-weight impurities were still present, and these impurities were further removed by hydrophobic HIC. During the first few trials of HIC, Butyl Sepharose High-Performance resin was tested, but it did not show enough binding affinity to PpSP15. Hence, a stronger HIC resin, Phenyl Sepharose 6 Fast Flow high sub (PS6FF), was chosen. By using PS6FF resin, impurities were reduced by an additional 3% and the purity of PpSP15 reached >97%. It was noted that typically the BH should be maintained while upscaling; however, the PS6FF column used during this development phase had a BH of 2.5 cm, and hence scaling up was not practical and required optimization. For future studies to scale up the process, we intend to pack a column with a BH between 10 and 20 cm and maintain the current residence time of 5.8 min to keep the binding capacity similar. Based on the binding capacity of PpSP15 to SPXL resin (52 mg/mL) and PS6FF resin (15 mg/ mL), the minimal CVs of both resins to purify this antigen and the estimated amount of purified antigen were calculated (Supplementary Table S3 ). For a typical 10 L fermentation process, approximately 4.5 L of FS is obtained. With the initial yield of 994 mg of PpSP15/L of FS, it will require an SPXL column with a CV of more than 86 mL and a PS6FF column with a CV of more than 260 mL to capture all the PpSP15 during purification. With 79% of high overall recovery, we expect to collect approximately 785 mg of purified PpSP15 per litter of FS. When comparing with the purification process for several other reported recombinant protein vaccine antigens at similar fermentation scale, 24, 27, [29] [30] [31] [32] one can find that the process for PpSP15 requires much less volume of resins; in addition, size exclusion chromatography, a process not ideal for large-scale production, had been included in the purification process for some of these recombinant protein vaccine antigens to increase their purity. 24, 27, 30, 31 However, the current purification scheme for PpSP15 does not require an size exclusion chromatography step to improve the purity to >95%, and all the chosen purification steps are scalable, except that dialysis was used to exchange PpSP15 into an appropriate buffer due to the small volumes at this development phase. For future upscaling, we plan to replace the dialysis step with diafiltration using 3 kDa Pellicon\u00ae cassettes. With respect to protein characterization, several biophysical and biochemical assays were performed to study the characteristics of this protein. It is well known that the recombinant proteins expressed in yeast can potentially be heavily N-glycosylated, 27, 33 an N-glycosylation assessment screening for the presence of the consensus sequence for N-glycosylation, AsnXxxSer/Thr/Cys (where Xxx can be any amino acid except proline) was conducted. 34 In the PpSP15 sequence ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ), there are 9 Asn residues, but only Asn22 is followed by Ser24. However, the amino acid in between Asn22 and Ser24 is Pro23, thus Asn22 is most likely not glycosylated. SDS-PAGE gels and the mass spectrometry also indicated the absence of N-glycans. Other more sensitive and specific assays were also applied to study the purity/impurity, including silver-stained SDS-PAGE and anti-PpSP15 western blot and anti-P. pastoris X33 HCP western blot. The results suggested that only trace amounts of HCPs and product-derived impurities, degraded PpSP15, were present in the purified PpSP15 sample. Moreover, no detectable aggregation was found, which was also supported by DLS and SE-HPLC. Indeed, its low binding affinity to the HIC column explaining this protein is likely highly hydrophilic. In addition, when comparing the PpSP15 sequence to PdSP15 and its crystal structure, 26 after excluding the signal peptide, it was predicted that all 6 cysteine residues in PpSP15 form disulfide bridges, and thus, no free cysteine residue should be present to form intermolecular disulfide bridges. These findings suggest a low tendency for PpSP15 to aggregate, a desirable property for long-term stability. The secondary structure analyzed by far-UV CD indicated PpSP15 as a highly alpha-helical protein (62.6% alpha-helix and 7.5% beta-sheet). This result was consistent with the secondary structure of its homolog, PdSP15 (PDB ID 4OZD), (66% helix), which further validated the assay. Finally, pH screening using a thermal shift assay was conducted to determine the proper pH system to maintain PpSP15 stability. It is noted that the onset temperature and melting temperature remained constant between pH 4.4 and 9.0; however, a lower melting temperature was observed at both pH 3.1 and 3.7, suggesting instability of PpSP15, which further indicates buffer formulations at a pH lower than 4.4 should be avoided.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2907, "end": 2910, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2911, "end": 2914, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2915, "end": 2919, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 2920, "end": 2924, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2925, "end": 2929, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2930, "end": 2934, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 3232, "end": 3235, "text": "24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 3236, "end": 3239, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3240, "end": 3243, "text": "30,", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 3244, "end": 3246, "text": "31", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 3931, "end": 3934, "text": "27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 3935, "end": 3937, "text": "33", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 4124, "end": 4126, "text": "34", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 5050, "end": 5052, "text": "26", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2353, "end": 2361, "text": "Table S3", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4152, "end": 4173, "text": "Supplementary Fig. S5", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Discussions"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the production process for recombinant PpSP15 as a leishmaniasis vaccine antigen candidate has been developed.
