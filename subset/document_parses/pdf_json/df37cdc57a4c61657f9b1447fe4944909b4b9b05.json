[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Quarantining asymptomatic patients is a crucial strategy for stopping the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. However, asymptomatic infections are often difficult to identify because widespread surveillance has not been the norm in the United States. The rate of asymptomatic infections in healthcare settings is of particular concern becuase they may expose healthcare providers or other patients at high risk of developing severe disease. In an effort to control SARS-CoV-2 transmission within the hospital setting, some hospitals have implemented universal SARS-CoV-2 testing among all consecutive admissions. [7] [8] [9] Our research group previously reported a 1% prevalence of asymptomatic infections at 2 large academic hospitals in Wisconsin from April to June 2020. 10 However, as the pandemic intensified in Wisconsin, positivity rates among asymptomatic patients increased to 6% (data nonpublished). Predicting hospital-level asymptomatic rates using COVID-19 county-level data may be useful for individual facilities. Thus, we investigated whether COVID-19 rates reported at the county level could predict the SARS-CoV-2 positivity rates among asymptomatic patients tested in a large academic health system.",

First, we fit a linear regression model to obtain the residuals (estimated errors). We then examined the residuals using the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function plots. Finally, we estimated the parameters for the daily COVID-19 incidence rate in Milwaukee County and the ARIMA model for the residuals.

Figure 1 shows the time-series plots of SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic positivity rates at Froedtert Health and COVID-19 rates in Milwaukee County. The overall positivity rate of asymptomatic infections at Froedtert Health was 37.8 per 1,000 people tested, and the overall positivity rate of COVID-19 infection in Milwaukee County was 172.3 per 1,000 people tested. Both monthly SARS-CoV-2 infection rates at Froedtert Health and the county-level COVID1-9 rates peaked in November 2020. In December 2020, the county-level COVID-19 rates were elevated, and rates of asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infections began to decline at Froedtert Health. The lowest COVID-19 rate at Froedtert Health was observed in May 2020, and the lowest COVID-19 rate for the county was observed in August 2020. To examine the association between the daily positivity rate of asymptomatic infections at Froedtert Health and the daily COVID-19 rate in Milwaukee County, we fitted a seventh-order autoregression for the residuals based on the autocorrelation function and the partial autocorrelation function. As the COVID-19 rate in Milwaukee County increased by 1 unit, the asymptomatic infection rate at Froedtert Health decreased by 0.024 units (95% CI, \u22120.053 to 0.004; P = .095) after accounting for autocorrelation over time. Thus, there was no strong association between positivity rates among SARS-CoV-2 asymptomatic patients at Froedtert Health and COVID-19 incidence rates in Milwaukee County. Supplementary Figure 1 shows the autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function plots of the residuals after fitting a seventh-order autoregression for error terms, which indicates that no autocorrelated errors occurred in the final model. Finally, most asymptomatic cases were located in Milwaukee County ( Fig. 2A) , even though the catchment area for all tests was fairly large (Fig. 2B) . Based on ADIs, hotspots of asymptomatic patients occurred in the most disadvantaged areas in the county (Fig. 2B ).",

However, implementing screening programs in cities or counties is difficult because it is expensive and logistically challenging. In addition, there are no national or international guidelines that define for whom, where, or when it is most feasible to perform massive screening for asymptomatic infections. In response, hospitals have implemented infection control and preventive measures based on how the COVID-19 pandemic behaves within the community, strengthening or relaxing restrictions based on COVID-19 epidemic curves at the state, county, or city level. However, it is important to consider that the patient population at an individual health system may not be representative of the population at the county level.",
