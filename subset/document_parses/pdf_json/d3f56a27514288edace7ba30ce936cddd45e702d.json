Once the acute stage of the infectious disease crisis does abate, however, few if any communities will have a detailed roadmap to guide recovery -that is, the process of becoming whole again and working to reduce similar, future risk. In both research and policy contexts where data are absent or difficult to obtain, expert judgment can help fill the void. Between November 2019 and February 2020, we conducted an expert elicitation process, asking fourteen key informants -with specializations in infectious diseases, disaster recovery, community resilience, public health, emergency management, and policymaking -to identify the design principles, priority issues, and field experiences that should inform development of an epidemic recovery model. Participants argued that recovery from epidemics is distinct from natural disasters due to epidemics' potential to produce effects over large areas for extended periods of time and ability to generate high levels of fear, anticipatory anxiety, and antisocial behavior. Furthermore, epidemic recovery is a complex, nonlinear process involving many domains -political, economic, sociocultural, infrastructural, and human health. As such, an adequate model of post-epidemic recovery should extend beyond strictly medical matters, specify units of interest (e.g., individual, family, institution, sector, community), capture differing trajectories of recovery given social determinants of health, and be fit for use depending upon user group (e.g., policymakers, responders, researchers). This formative study commences a longer-term effort to generate indicators for a holistic, transformative epidemic recovery at the community level.",

The profound yearning for a \"return to normal\" distinguishes much public discourse as the COVID-19 pandemic enters its eighteenth month in the United States (U.S.) (Tsipursky, 2020) . The SARS-CoV-2 virus has stressed individuals and communities through a mixture of impacts: ill health and excess deaths, social isolation, economic hardship, and the psychological strain of it all (COVID Impact Survey, 2020). This compounded misery has prompted what some people have called \"pandemic fatigue\" (Kossakovski, 2020) . As the infectious disease crisis has dragged on and on, the urge to reopen -that is, to resume the familiar rhythms of school, work, worship, and play -has been so acute that, sometimes, it led to a premature lifting of public health controls over the virus (\"See reopening plans and mask mandates,\" 2021). As a result, some communities, states, and regions rebounded not to a comfortable normal, but instead, to resurgent infection and the need to reapply interventions like \"lockdowns\" once again.",

While holistic, the NDRF's framing of recovery is still written from the vantage of events that compromise physical structures, rather than epidemics in which people continue to fall ill while buildings stand. The Recovery Federal Interagency Operations Plan (FIOP) guides the coordination of federal support to response and recovery in affected jurisdictions (DHS, 2016) , while its Biological Incident Annex (BIA) outlines the uniqueness of pathogendriven events (DHS, 2017) . Informing federal resource mobilization, the FIOP and BIA do not detail epidemic recovery for communities. Other influential DHS documents regarding biological incidents conceive recovery narrowly (versus NDRF's holism), by emphasizing the cleanup of contaminated buildings and wide areas (DHS 2012 (DHS , 2009 ).",

Recovery, too, may be something easier to distinguish or call out if an epidemic has been expansive and affected a lot of people.

In the instance of a Hepatitis A outbreak, cases of infection can disappear in a city, and homeless persons can still be vilified as disease vectors.

For many subjects, the ultimate value of a post-epidemic recovery model lies in its ability to articulate actionable steps toward desired outcomes. Ideally, it should enable users to chart pathways toward desired recovery endpoints or correlates; identify both proximal and distal roadblocks to full recovery; J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f pinpoint leverage points for enhancing recovery efforts; and/or identify emergent properties and behaviors within community systems that could accelerate or impede progress.

Reflecting this, an epidemic recovery model can benefit from the natural disaster literature's holism and from the health systems-strengthening literature's emphasis on sector resilience in high-, middle-, and low-income settings. Health systems research suggests that success of disaster recovery efforts depends on sector capacities to absorb and adapt to the impacts of rapid onset crises, and to evolve to meet the demands of post-crisis environments (Blanchet et al., 2017; Kruk et al 2015) . Given that epidemic effects are most severe in low-income countries -which typically have weak capacity to deliver routine health services -the health systems-strengthening scholarship can help accommodate epidemic recovery thinking in applying to a spectrum of diverse geographies, resource levels, and governance structures. interests, and/or political powers play out: get back to how things were even though vulnerability to a future disaster remains (e.g., rebuild in a flood zone) or make systemic improvements (e.g., turn formerly occupied floodplains into green fields and build affordable housing elsewhere) (Arendt & Alesch 2014; Smith et al 2018; Tierney & Oliver-Smith 2012) . Key informants, too, highlighted that the post-epidemic process entails complex trade-offs, as in scarce public resources being carved up among response, recovery, and steady state needs, and that people waver in defining post-epidemic recovery as a return to baseline or a chance to evolve. Natural disaster theorists have moved away from early recovery models marked by fixed phases, predictable milestones, and uniform progression (Rubin 2009 ). Instead, they have envisioned postdisaster recovery as a non-linear, multi-level process that can unfold unevenly, depending on an affected group's socio-demographics and the unit of analysis under study: e.g., household, neighborhood, community, sector, region (Arendt & Alesch 2014; Finucane et al., 2020; Johnson & Hayashi 2012; Monteil et al., 2020; Tierney & Oliver-Smith 2012) . After a major flood or hurricane, an affected city may seemingly be back to normal. Yet, specific neighborhoods may still be lacking critical services and individual families still reeling from financial and psychological effects. Disaster researchers note, too, that event severity can influence the cadence and quality of recovery (Philips & Neal, 2007) .",

Concomitantly, the benefits of vaccination, remote working arrangements, pandemic relief loans to businesses, and other measures intended to alleviate these burdens have not been equitably distributed among the communities hit hardest by the pandemic (Gould & Shierholz 2020; Hamel et al., 2021; Heeb 2021) . Thus, recovery plans must necessarily center transformation, taking care to ensure that restorative efforts do not simply refabricate the starting conditions that gave rise to the inequitable impacts of COVID-19 (Schoch-Spana et al., 2021) Post-pandemic recovery will likely proceed at varying timelines across different settings and communities, depending on the unique social and structural factors modulating the trajectories of local COVID-19 epidemics. A robust model of epidemic recovery that accounts for these factors, articulates J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the relationships between them, and centers input and evidence from the hardest-hit populations, could help decision-makers at all levels navigate the process of restoring and transforming their communities.",
