Geographic visualization shows the geographical location and related information of all epidemic areas in an intuitive way; timeline visualization provides visualize temporal data in a specific period; spatiotemporal visualization combines geographical area and time interval to explore the deeper meaning of data. Those approaches are widely used in the COVID-19 pandemic, such as assessing the geographic risk of COVID-19 transmission [3] , monitoring the control measures [4] , presenting the timeline of COVID-19 outbreak [5] , etc. Despite the variety of data visualization methods, for the pandemic disease like COVID-19, there is limited method to comprehensively demonstrate the global epidemic in one graph through constructing multi-dimensional core indicators.",

The three main epidemiological indicators in balloon chart included crude case fatality rate (CFR), cumulative incidence (CI, as a measure of morbidity) and mortality that were frequently used for assessment of the transmissibility and severity of an epidemic. CFR and CI were shown in X-and Y-axis, respectively. Mortality was illustrated in contour area separated with isolines. The cumulative number of COVID-19 cases was indicated with the size of the balloon. The colors of the balloons represented the different continents where the country or region is located. More importantly, the changing track of the COVID-19 epidemic of a region within a specific period was monitored with the movement of the small tail attached to the balloon.",

Only the balloon of East Asia appeared on the chart in February. Afterwards from March to September, more balloons were noticed and became predominate in a time-associated manner: South Europe (represented by Italy and Spain), West and North Europe (Belgium, France, UK, Sweden), North America (the US and Canada), East Europe (Russia, Belarus) and West Asia (Iran, Iraq, Turkey), Central and South America (Brazil, Peru, Chile, Mexico), Southern Africa (South Africa), Caribbean, South Asia (India, Pakistan, Afghanistan), North Africa (Egypt and Morocco), Southeast Asia (Philippines and Indonesia) and Oceania (Australia). From May to July, the balloons of South, North and West Europe gradually stopped moving, reflecting that the epidemics in those regions were under control or remitted. At the same time, subregions in America, especially North and South America, exceeded Europe in morbidity and took the leading position thereafter. Since October, the balloons of Europe, North America and West Asia has been rising rapidly, reaching a dramatically high morbidity level by December, suggesting an emerging winter wave of COVID-19 which was much bigger than Fig. 2 Time-associated alteration of the crude case-fatality rate, cumulative incidence and mortality of COVID-19 in UN geographic regions by month, Feb. 1st to Dec. 20th 2020. Cumulative incidence: Cumulative cases/population; CFR: Cumulative deaths/ cumulative cases; Mortality: Cumulative deaths/population. The size of balloon represents cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. The tail of the balloon in each monthly freeze frame records the change of indicators in each region within the month. Regions with cumulative deaths less than 100 were not shown. X and Y-axis are plotted in log scale the previous ones. After a rapid increase in morbidity from May to September, Southern Africa and South Asia slowed down and has almost stopped moving in December. Although the balloons representing the regions of low incomes remained at the bottom area, including Africa (except Southern Africa) and Southeast Asia, we should be aware that there is lots of room for the balloons to go up if prevention and preparation interventions were absent or relaxed. Relatively undeveloped public health system and medical service in those regions would make it more difficult to control the COVID-19 pandemic in the future once these areas were severely affected. Compared with the traditional way of presenting geographical variation by maps, the balloon charts further allow readers to visualize the relative position of different regions without losing information about the quantitative measurement of transmissibility and severity. What's more, it's quite flexible for the balloon charts to display various dimension according to the outbreak scale and type of location, without relying on existing geocoded data, which it easier to use in resource poor countries.",

As the coming of winter holidays and the emerging of SARS-CoV-2 variant recently identified in the UK [1] , these countries need to take stronger measures and improve people's compliance to contain the fast spreading of COVID-19. In Asia, Turkey had a long tail that doubled the number of cumulative cases, which was due to the surge on Dec. 10 caused by the adjustment of case definition to include mild cases [13] . In this period, the CFRs of most countries were at a low level of less than 5%, but Mexico had an exceptional high CFR close to 10% accompanying a high morbidity. As Mexico's official said, the median age of death from COVID-19 was 55 years, much younger than an average of 75 years in many European countries, and the death pattern may result from high rates of underlying health conditions such as obesity, diabetes and hypertension [14] . China, the second populous country in the world and the first country reporting COVID-19 cases, still stayed in the lowest mortality zone by December.
