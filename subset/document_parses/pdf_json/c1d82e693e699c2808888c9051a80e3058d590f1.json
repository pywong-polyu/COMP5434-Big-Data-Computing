Previous studies have been limited by small and/or unrepresentative samples, cross-sectional designs and absence of control groups. 5, 6 Although several studies using routine data reported elevated rates of psychiatric disorders following COVID-19 illness, 7-12 others have not found clear evidence of associations. 13, 14 Further, most studies using routine data lacked detailed information on pre-pandemic health and sociodemographic factors, and mainly focused on more severe COVID-19 and recorded mental health disorders. 15, 16 A study using data from six cohorts in Europe found that severe acute COVID-19 illness was associated with adverse mental health outcomes. 17 In addition, longitudinal studies in the UK have found associations between COVID-19 and psychological distress, [18] [19] [20] although findings have been mixed across different mental health outcomes 21 and, in the COVID Symptom Study a modest association was found in older participants only. 18 Further longitudinal research is needed to clarify previous mixed findings, to investigate the magnitude of any association, and to examine whether associations are sustained in the longer-term post-infection.",

These findings could also reflect increased risk of microvascular or neurological changes post COVID-19, which has been associated with depression and anxiety phenotypes in older adults.

The lack of association with mental health when serology data detected SARS-CoV-2 infections that had not been reported, i.e., cases where participants were unaware of the infection, also support this conclusion. However, this group were likely to have had mild or asymptomatic COVID-19. In addition, it is possible that those who were particularly concerned about consequences of infection were more likely to report perceived infection. It should also be noted that only a subset of studies and samples had serology data, thereby substantially reducing power in these analyses. Additionally, only one timepoint of serology assessment was completed after the most recent self-report data thereby limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Further, antibody levels following SARS-CoV-2 infection have been found to wane over time, 27 which could have led to misclassification based on serology data.",

            "text": "The use of multiple longitudinal studies is a significant strength and allowed us to control for time period effects and important pre-pandemic factors including mental health, physical health and socio-economic factors. Thus, in comparison to previous studies using electronic health records or pandemic-specific online surveys, we were able to include more detailed information on a wider range of pre-pandemic variables. Rich antecedent data in longitudinal prospective studies also allowed most studies to be weighted for non-response (reducing potential bias from selection into analysed samples). However, while we were able to control for important confounders, we cannot definitively attribute changes in mental health to COVID-19 illness. Included studies used varying measures to assess COVID-19 and mental health outcomes. These were carefully reviewed and harmonised across studies, and in metaanalysis the heterogeneity of estimates between studies was small for most outcomes. Nonetheless, measurement error of the exposure is a potential limitation, given that our main exposure variables were based on self-reported COVID-19; although the additional analysis including serology data helps to mitigate against this. Previous studies have mainly focused on severe COVID-19 or severe mental illness. 8, 10 Our results add to existing evidence by capturing broader and subclinical mental health impacts of COVID-19 illness in the population. However, further possible limitations are the lack of data available to examine possible variation in associations by COVID-19 severity, that only infections in the first year of the pandemic have been assessed, and that longitudinal follow-up is limited at present.",

Further research is needed to investigate these possible underlying mechanisms and to examine whether associations persist over longer follow-up periods. Our findings highlight the important .
