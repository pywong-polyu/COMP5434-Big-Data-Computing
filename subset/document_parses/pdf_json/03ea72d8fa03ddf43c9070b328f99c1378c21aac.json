In particular, the definition of endpoints related to the severity, time frame, and clinical course remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted a cross-sectional analysis of phase III randomized trials for COVID-19 registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. Phase: Phase 3. From the downloaded search results, we selected trials that met the following criteria: Primary Purpose: Treatment; Allocation: Randomized. We manually transcribed information not included in the downloaded file, such as Primary Outcome Measures, Secondary Outcome Measures, Time Frame, and Inclusion Criteria. In the analysis, we examined primary and secondary endpoints in trials with severe and non-severe patients, including the types of endpoints, time frame, clinical course, and sample size. Results: A total of 406 trials were included in the analysis. The median numbers of endpoints in trials with severe and nonsevere patients were 9 and 7, respectively. Approximately 25% of the trials used multiple primary endpoints. Regardless of the type of endpoint, the time frames were longer in the trials with severe patients than in the trials with non-severe patients. In the evaluation of the clinical course, worsening was often considered in binary endpoints, and improvement was considered in time-to-event endpoints. The sample size was the largest in clinical trials using binary endpoints.",

            "text": "Since its identification in Wuhan, China, in late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has rapidly spread and created a global pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 . Globally, there have been 149,216,984 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 3,144,028 deaths as of April 29, 2021 [1] . Most infected patients present with asymptomatic or mild disease [2] . Many patients recover quickly without severe complications, others with severe disease can take 6-8 weeks or longer for recovery, and some patients have a severe form of the disease that can progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome and death [2, 3] . Therefore, urgent development of treatments is needed, especially for patients with severe disease. However, it may be difficult to conduct clinical trials appropriately because there are multiple clinical courses, and there is no consensus on the endpoints in evaluating COVID-19 treatments so far. For studies of any intervention in hospitalized patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19, the Core Outcome Measures in Effectiveness Trials (COMET) initiative considered mortality and respiratory support as core outcomes [4] . However, they did not mention the definitions of endpoints for these outcomes, such as the types of endpoints and the time frame. In patient populations that are close to recovery, such as patients who do not require oxygen inhalation, the time to recovery is an important endpoint as it is used for evaluating treatments for influenza. However, the COMET initiative did not consider recovery as a core outcome. Therefore, more studies on endpoints in the evaluation of COVID-19 treatments are needed.",

The endpoints of clinical trials, including randomized and non-randomized trials, involved symptoms, death, recovery, intensive care requirement, hospital discharge, oxygenation, critical illness assessment instruments, and viral load assays [5] . Most clinical trials have used multiple endpoints [5] . Among 49 phase III randomized trials for COVID-19 registered by April 2020, the most common primary endpoint was an ordinal endpoint, which included information such as death, hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, and supplemental oxygen; mortality was the less common primary endpoint [6] . For example, the ordinal scale from 0 (no clinical or virological evidence of infection) to 8 (death) , suggested by the World Health Organization (WHO) [9] , was used as the primary endpoint [10] . Among all endpoints, including primary and secondary endpoints, mortality was the most common [7] . When there is little information about the illness, treatment, and relevant outcomes, it is difficult to define endpoints [3] . For example, in the adaptive COVID-19 treatment (ACTT-1) study [11] , the primary endpoint was changed from an ordinal scale to time-to-recovery after the trial was initiated because of external information that COVID-19 may be more protracted than anticipated.",

The effect on the time to recovery was observed in the overall population (rate ratio 1.29, 95% CI 1.12-1.49); however, the effect was not homogenous among the subjects and was more apparent in patients not requiring supplementary oxygen in the ACTT-1 study [11] . The rate ratio for mortality in the solidarity trial was 0.95 (95% CI 0.81-1.11) [13] , and the hazard ratio for mortality through days 14 and 29 in the ACTT-1 study was 0.55 (95% CI 0.36-0.83) and 0.73 (95% CI 0.52-1.03), respectively [11] .

Treatment effects can vary according to the spectrum of the disease and the timing of treatment [8] . The spectrum of the disease is related to the clinical course, according to which patients will ultimately return to normal function or die even after curative treatment. For example, when defining endpoints, the direction of the clinical courses is related to the handling of competing events. Death is the competing event for time to recovery/improvement, and recovery/improvement is the semi-competing event for time to death [3] . Specifically, the direction of the clinical courses should be considered in endpoints, and endpoints can be different among study populations based on the spectrum of the disease [3] . Although relevant clinical outcomes for COVID-19 may be readily assessed and available within days or weeks [14] , a treatment effect that occurs early but dissipates later may not be clinically meaningful, and a treatment effect that occurs later may be missed because of early evaluation [3] . The time frame for endpoints or the timing of evaluation is crucial in a novel disease with substantial heterogeneity [3] . Although there are clinically important endpoints, the use of these endpoints can be challenging because of social conditions and feasibility. For example, ordinal endpoints can become less meaningful when patient numbers exceed hospital capacity, and mechanical ventilators or high-flow oxygen devices are unavailable [3] . The treatment effect on mortality would be clinically meaningful; however, deaths are relatively rare, and few studies would be sufficiently powered to detect the treatment effect [8] . Therefore, the definitions and elements of endpoints remain controversial.",

The trial information is reported in the trial registration, and ClinicalTrials.gov, the largest registry of clinical trials globally, provides detailed information. Summarizing the information in registered trials can reveal the definitions of endpoints of clinical interest that can differ between severe and non-severe patients. In general, endpoints differ between exploratory and confirmatory trials; more definitive and more clinically meaningful endpoints are used in confirmatory trials. In this article, we examine and clarify the characteristics of endpoints that reflect clinical interests for the treatment of COVID-19 by using information from phase III randomized trials for COVID-19 registered in ClinicalTrials.gov. In particular, we discuss endpoints that reflect clinical interests by comparing characteristics between clinical trials with severe patients and those with non-severe patients based on combinations of time frame, clinical course, sample size, and types of endpoints.",

All trials registered in the IRCT were conducted in Iran, and the median target sample size was only 70 patients (data not shown). Therefore, our results are representative because they are based on large clinical trials conducted in various countries and registered at ClinicalTrials.gov. Because the downloaded file from the IRCT did not include enough information for our analysis, we did not use data from the IRCT. In the analysis, we focused on the types, time frame, and clinical course of the endpoints based on severity. We also evaluated the relationships between the primary endpoints and the sample size and the secondary endpoints. Although some researchers [3, 18, 19] have proposed new endpoints for evaluating COVID-19 treatments, it is necessary to review the endpoints that have been used in practice to reach a consensus for the evaluation of COVID-19 treatment. This study provides information that can facilitate this consensus. According to this survey of trials registered in ClinicalTrial.gov, approximately 25% of the trials used multiple primary endpoints. This is partly because COVID-19 is a novel infectious disease, and an evaluation method has not yet been established. Binary endpoints were the most common primary endpoints. These results largely differed from those of a previous study conducted by April 2020 [6] . One of the reasons for this difference is that mortality was considered a binary endpoint (whether a patient survived across a specific time window) rather than a time-to-event endpoint (time to death from randomization). If treatment aims to prevent mortality for the entire period in short-term studies, binary endpoints may be more clinically relevant [20, 21] . Although the sample size of clinical trials using a binary endpoint was larger in this survey, which may be due to the loss of information on binary endpoints compared to time-to-event endpoints, these trials could have considered clinical relevance as well as development speed. On the other hand, considering hospital capacity and availability of mechanical ventilators or other devices, evaluation of mortality by time-to-event endpoints, as in the ACTT-1 study [11] and the Solidarity trial [14] , may be meaningful. Ordinal variables were not only used A single drug with multiple doses that was placed under the same \"Arm\" in interventions was considered as one arm SD standard deviation, IQR interquartile range directly as the primary endpoint but also used for the definition of binary and time-to-event endpoints (recovery or improvement). The reasons to avoid using an ordinal endpoint may be as follows: it is difficult to interpret the results of analysis methods such as the proportional odds model, the power in using the time-toevent endpoint could be larger than that with the ordinal endpoint [3] , and analyzing longitudinal ordinal endpoints among survivors can lead to bias (survivor bias) [18] . The time frames of the endpoints were longer in clinical trials with severe patients, which may be attributed to the relationship between the clinical course and the severity. In the ACTT-1 study, the time to recovery in non-severe patients was shorter than that in severe patients [11] . According to this survey, mortality was evaluated as a secondary endpoint more frequently in clinical trials with severe patients than in those with non-severe patients. To appropriately evaluate mortality, a longer time frame may be required. The time frame of endpoints other than mortality may be determined by considering that of mortality. Although the time point of primary interest for evaluating each endpoint could be different, these time points may be related because each endpoint can be a competing event [3] . When interpreting the results of competing risk analysis, it is important to show not only the endpoint of interest but also the endpoints of the competing event [22, 23] .",

Although worsening was evaluated using binary endpoints and improvement was evaluated by a time-to-event endpoint, according to the survey, there is no rationale for using a particular endpoint. Longitudinal evaluation is necessary when the clinical course can be complex. The definitions of improvement and recovery varied among the trials. When using improvement of one or more categories from the baseline category as the definition, it is assumed that the clinical meaningfulness of the improvement does not depend on the baseline category. However, for example, there is no guarantee that improvement from 5 to 3 and from 4 to 2 present the same meaning when using the WHO ordinal scale [9] . Therefore, it would be better to consider the baseline status or the threshold for improvement. In at least half of the trials, both directions of clinical courses were evaluated, regardless of the primary and secondary endpoints. Evaluating both directions in longitudinal changes can result in analyses with moderate to good power [24] . In clinical trials for infectious diseases, both directions of the clinical course may be considered important in both clinical and statistical aspects.",

When treatment aims to prevent mortality for the entire period in shortterm studies, a binary endpoint should be used [20, 21] . However, in the early stage of the pandemic, it may be possible to use time-to-event endpoints in consideration of hospital capacity, which may cause censoring. In this case, it should be better to evaluate the treatment effect based on survival probabilities at a specific time point rather than the hazard ratio. Although the time frame for mortality in non-severe patients could be shorter than that in severe patients, at least 14 days should be considered. When treatment aims to improve recovery, a time-to-event endpoint should be used because it is Discussions on the results of this survey are related to some attributes of estimand [25] , population, variable (endpoint), and intercurrent events. In this situation, the severity is related to the population. Death (mortality) can be either an endpoint or an intercurrent event. The intercurrent events to be considered depending on the estimand. The way death is handled may vary depending on the strategy. For example, when time to ventilation and time to death are endpoints (both endpoints are related to \"worsening\" events), we can consider a composite variable strategy (time to first event). When recovery and death are endpoints (one is related to \"improvement,\" the other is related to \"worsening\"), it could be better to apply the competing risk approach. The hypothetical strategy and the principal stratum strategy may be inappropriate in this situation because the assumption that death would not occur would not be realistic, and the principal stratum of always survivors would not be a target population. In this study, we had access only to the information in ClinicalTrials.gov, so we could not ascertain the estimand of each trial.",

For example, some trials might include patients requiring small amounts of supplemental oxygen, and other trials might include those requiring ECMO. Thus, the choice of endpoints depends on the detail of severity. Second, information on improvement (recovery) may not be sufficient. As discussed, the definition of improvement can affect the time frame. In addition, we did not mention the details of continuous endpoints. Finally, we did not extract information on the analysis methods related to the selection of endpoints and sample size. For example, a competing risk analysis was considered in the ACTT-1 study [11] . This information may be obtained from published articles of clinical trials; however, it was difficult to extract this information from ClinicalTrials.gov. The statistical properties of the endpoints should be evaluated by simulation studies based on actual clinical trials, such as the ACTT-1 study. Based on the present survey results, we will propose a new endpoint for evaluating the clinical course in both directions and compare it with existing endpoints in a future study.",

However, a soft definition of improvement (recovery), such as improvement of two points in ordinal variables, may not be meaningful for the time-to-event endpoint because some patients who initially required high-flow oxygen may later require ECMO. \"No need for treatment\" such as disappearance of symptoms or discharge would be a better definition of improvement. However, we should be careful about reasons such as exceeding hospital capacity[3] when discharge is used for the definition, especially during the pandemic. Although the time frame for nonsevere patients could be shorter than that for severe patients, it depends on the definition of improvement. In the early stage of the pandemic of a novel infectious disease, it is difficult to determine appropriate endpoints for treatments; however, we could choose appropriate endpoints based on information from the clinical courses of early patients. For COVID-19, severity or baseline characteristics should be considered when choosing endpoints.",
