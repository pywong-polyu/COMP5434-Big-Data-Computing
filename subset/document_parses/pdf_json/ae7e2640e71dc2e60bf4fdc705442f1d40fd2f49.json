This study aimed to discover the coping strategies and post-traumatic growth (PTG) experiences of persons who were infected by the COVID-19 virus using the qualitative research method. The research involved 17 individuals, nine of whom were female. All had been diagnosed with COVID-19. Face-to-face and online interviews were conducted with participants. In the analysis of the data, the thematic analysis method was performed by developing themes and sub-themes. The created themes include coping strategies, existential growth, lessons learned from disease, new opportunities, and social growth. These themes indicated positive changes in the lives of persons who were infected by the COVID-19 virus after the COVID-19 disease. Findings and implications for the practice were discussed.",

The worldwide number of people who have been diagnosed is above 416.6 million and the number of deaths is over 5.8 million (by February 2022) since the first case was formally identified (WHO, 2022a) . In parallel with this increase, the number of diagnosed people has reached 12.051.852 including 88.312 deaths to date (by February 2022) in Turkey (Turkish Ministry of National Health, 2022) . It is obvious that so far, the COVID-19 pandemic has created a major threat to both the physical and mental health of millions of people (Lee & Neimeyer, 2020; \u015eim\u015fir et al., 2021a) .",

Other symptoms may also involve loss of smell and taste, shortness of breath, persistent cough, diarrhea, delirium, skipped a meal, abdominal pain, chest pain, and hoarse voice (Menni et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2020) . We still do not have sufficient information about the possible damages the COVID-19 may have on the human body. Additionally, COVID-19-infected patients are prone to mental health issues (Ma et al., 2020) . As it is well known, widespread contagious diseases tend to increase the levels of uncertainty, fear, stress, and anxiety that can destroy coping strategies and result in trauma (Chew et al., 2020) . Recent researches showed that rates of overall mental health problems, psychiatric morbidity, and chronic fatigue were prevalent among COVID-19 patients (Aliakbari Dehkordi et al., 2020; Guo et al., 2020; Ma et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2020) . A meta-analysis study by Deng et al. (2021) among COVID-19 patients demonstrated that the prevalence of depression was 45%, the prevalence of anxiety was 47%, and the pooled prevalence of sleep disturbances was 34%. Furthermore, hospital treatment and the use of mechanical ventilation in intensive care units (ICUs) may increase the risk of developing acute psychiatric symptoms such as depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (Hatch et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2021a) . The COVID-19 patients with ongoing mental health issues have a higher risk of mortality two years after ICU discharge (Hatch et al., 2020) . Accordingly, coping strategies and the well-being of COVID-19 patients should not be neglected. In this regard, we aimed to discover coping styles and PTG experiences of persons who were infected by the COVID-19 virus in our study.",

PTG implies not only returning to a pre-existing state of equilibrium but also establishing a perspective that reassesses life positively (Tamiolaki Muchacka-Cymerman, 2020; Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004) . The manifestation of PTG involves a greater appreciation of life, more positive interpersonal relationships, a greater sense of personal power, shifting priorities, and a deeper existential and spiritual life (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004) .",

Most theoretical structures allow the use of TA, which provides flexibility and accessibility (Braun & Clarke, 2006; Terry et al., 2017) . The first move was to build themes together, later, creating the sub-themes. We determined common themes and sub-themes based on our agreement. Deductive and predominantly inductive methods were combined in data analysis. A deductive approach is a theory-testing process, whereas an inductive approach is a theory-building process that seeks to reach generalizations (Hyde, 2000) . Furthermore, the inductive approach is preferred when there is a lack of study or hypothesis while existing of current research results or hypotheses (Elo & Kyng\u00e4s, 2008) . According to Patton (2002) , a researcher may use both an inductive and deductive approach to analysis, beginning with an inductive approach and then moving to a more deductive approach when analyzing results. Furthermore, Armat et al. (2018) pointed out that labeling only inductive or deductive approaches can lead to an erroneous assumption. Thus, researchers may use either deductive or inductive approaches instead of solely applying one. In the current study deductive elements were themes, and the inductive elements were sub-themes.",

Some sub-themes evolved as a result of all authors' and literature's input, and the final versions of themes and subthemes were created at the end of the third meeting. We then used member-checking for credibility by asking participants through e-mails and phone calls to what extent the results represent their views (e.g., Ba\u015fkale, 2016; Patton, 2002) . We were able to contact 20% of the participants and asked whether themes and sub-themes represented their views or not.

For example, P6 (M, 55 years) said, \"I prayed a lot and believed that God is the source of all good and evil. I took my medications and prayed for healing at all times, and I tried holding my spirits up.\" Some COVID-19 participants initially struggled to recognize their disease, but as time passed, they came to terms with it and began to use positive thinking to cope with stressors. Regarding the sub-theme acceptance and positive thinking, P9 (M, 35 years) emphasized that \"On the third and fifth day of the illness, which were the worst days of COVID-19, I did not become pessimistic and thought that I will get better. I accepted this illness and tried to think positively. I tried to keep my mind and body stronger.\" Participants maintained their \"The social support\" mechanism during the COVID-19 process of dealing with the illness. Many participants said that they received social support from their significant others, which helped them feel better. P1 (M, 58 years), for example, said, \"My wife has always been really supportive of me. Every day, my son gave me an injection, and my mother and father called me every day.\" Similar to other patients, participants who had stayed at home for a long time in quarantine and engaged in activities to cope with these difficult circumstances to relieve tension and we categorized this sub-theme as paying attention to activities. \"I had a horrible headache and couldn't pay attention to anything. I tried to keep myself busy with something. I attempted to engage in my hobbies, such as playing the violin.\" P7 (F, 20 years) talked about this sub-theme. In addition, some participants used self-care strategies to relax physically and mentally. P5 (F, 38 years) reported that \"I realized that we must take care of ourselves.

They reflected on their own lives and considered how they would rebuild their lives after they had recovered. Faith, spirituality, and religiosity were prominent sub-themes in this theme. Participants with faith in God grew spiritually. For example, P15 (F, 38 years) said, \"I felt like I wasn't really close to God and that I wasn't praying enough, which has bothered me. I am attempting to pray more from now on.\" Furthermore, most of participants reported that their sense of death was raised after people died of the COVID-19 around the world. P1 (M, 58 years), in response to the sub-theme awareness of death, said, \"We as humans are very close to death and may face it every second. Not only did I lose my significant other, but so did our relatives, and we realized that life isn't as important as we thought. Every second may be our last minute.

I would say that working is beneficial, but spending long hours is harmful. During this time, I had the opportunity to reflect these thoughts on my life. What exactly am I doing?

For example, P12 (F, 80 years) reported \"I learned that life was beautiful and before this illness, I thought that I was old enough for new things. However, now life seems more precious to live.\" Besides, some participants highlighted the increase in gratitude. P3 (F, 29 years) stated under the sub-theme gratitude that \"My understanding of what I have increased. I have been more thankful for small but significant things like walking down the street without a mask on, gathering with my friends and family, and sharing a cup of coffee in a caf\u00e9.

Hence, this study investigated PTG and coping experiences of persons who were infected by the COVID-19 virus using the phenomenological design. We summarized our findings in five themes including coping strategies, existential growth, lessons learned from disease, new opportunities, and social growth. These themes supported the PTG theory (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004) . PTG theory consists of the following dimensions: Appreciation of life, personal strength, new opportunities, relating to others, and spiritual change (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 1996) . The \"existential growth\" theme in our research includes spiritual change and appreciation of life dimensions in PTG theory. Our \"new opportunities\" theme includes the new possibilities and personal power dimension in PTG theory. Our \"social growth\" theme is about relating to other dimensions in PTG theory. Additionally, our themes include participants' coping strategies and lessons learned from the disease. These findings might broaden the scope of the PTG theory.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has posed an extraordinary challenge for the entire humanity. Both active and avoidant coping strategies contribute to the psychological health of individuals affected by pandemic disasters (Main et al., 2011) . Human beings have faced many deadly diseases throughout history. The Ebola is one of them. The Ebola disease was predominantly seen in African countries such as Sudan, Gabon, Congo, Uganda, and has not spread as much as COVID-19. The case fatality rate of Ebola is around 50% (WHO, 2022b). As of February 11, 2022, the case fatality rate of the COVID-19 is around 1.41% (WHO, 2022a) . The Ebola disease is more deadly than COVID-19. Therefore, there are great differences between the disease experiences of the patients. Unlike our research, Ebola patients used methods such as trying to relax by making drugs from various plants as a strategy to cope with the disease (Schwerdtle et al., 2017) . However, there are similar coping strategies in studies on Ebola patients and our research on COVID-19 patients. Researchers reported that during the Ebola pandemic, people prayed fervently and used religious coping (Matua & Wal, 2015; Schwerdtle et al., 2017) . In another study on Ebola, researchers emphasized that family, friends, and prayer support helped individuals' to overcome difficulties (Rabelo et al., 2016) . The literature also showed that social support can help sustain psychosocial well-being during the COVID-19 pandemic (Minahan et al., 2021) . Researchers reported that older participants used coping methods to address the stress of COVID-19, such as staying busy, seeking social support, and having a positive mindset (Fuller & Huseth-Zosel, 2021) . These coping styles are consistent with the approaches expressed by the participants of our study. We assumed that the coping styles used by the participants were effective and significant for the PTG process. It is increasingly recognized that personal and interpersonal resources (e.g., coping strategies, social support, communication) had a positive relationship with PTG (Palacio et al., 2020) .",

One of the difficult living conditions is a pandemic disease (Bridgland et al., 2021; Sanchez-Gomez et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021) . All persons infected by serious symptoms because of COVID-19 must be treated and isolated in a hospital. They are not permitted to accept visits from family and friends. After discharge, they must be quarantined at home for at least 14 days. This severely limits their freedom and disturbs all of their prior lifestyle routines. As a result, COVID-19 is a distressing and traumatic event for many patients and survivors (Yan et al., 2021) . Bridgland et al. (2021) also revealed that COVID-19 is a traumatic stressor event capable of triggering PTSD-like reactions and worsening other linked mental health disorders (e.g., depression, anxiety, psychosocial functioning, etc.). In this vein, it is not surprising that persons who were infected by the COVID-19 virus also develop PTG. Likewise, researchers reported PTG experiences of individuals after outbreaks such as SARS and Ebola (Cheng et al., 2006; Mok et al., 2005; Rabelo et al., 2016) . Similarly, we reported that individuals experienced PTG after the COVID-19 outbreak. We categorized the post-traumatic growth experiences of individuals after COVID-19 as follows: existential growth, lessons learned from disease, new opportunities, and social growth.",

(2015) outlined the PTG categories as communication with others, personal strength, a new style and philosophy in life, appreciation of it, and spiritual elevation. In another study, PTG experiences were categorized as belief in a higher power, appreciation for life, changing priorities, religious and spiritual change, personal power, and compassion for others (Shakespeare-Finch et al., 2014) . During the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers reported that people have high levels of personal relationships, strengthen emotional power and resilience, gain deeper spiritual connection, and a sense of gratitude for life (Arnout & Al-Sufyani, 2021) . The researchers categorized the PTG experience after COVID-19 into themes such as interpersonal relations, new possibilities, personal power, spiritual conversion, appreciation of life, and pollution reduction (Maftei & Holman, 2020) . Moreover, Stallard et al. (2021) categorized the PTG experiences of carers of children in the period of COVID-19 as relating to others, discovering and embracing new possibilities, and spiritual growth. In the end, these findings are compatible with the themes and sub-themes in our study.",

Understanding such mechanisms offers a fundamental comprehension of the experiences of COVID-19 patients, as well as evidence and information for mental health practitioners to consider when planning treatments to improve their clients' coping. Second, while the most research in the literature addressing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on mental health focuses on negative impacts (Dilma\u00e7 et al., 2021; \u015eim\u015fir et al., 2021b) , our study focused on positive outcomes. PTG experiences of COVID-19 patients may both support their adaptation to the damage in their lives by the pandemic and improve their future live (Sun et al., 2021b) . Third, participants' COVID-19 disease experiences not only led to positive developments in their social relationships, personal strength, and existential notions but also improvements in health awareness. This awareness may have a favorable impact on participants' behavior on important subjects like being vaccinated, following hygiene rules, and wearing masks.",

In the statements of participants, there were no considerable differences observed in the overall PTG levels compared to their severity of COVID-19 symptoms. However, when we examined the themes that arose from the study, certain personal differences stand out. Patients with severe COVID-19 prioritized themes of existential growth and new opportunities the most, whereas those with moderate and mild diseases stressed themes of social growth and lessons learned from disease the most. This might be because patients with COVID-19 encounter mortality more closely, their underlying existing schemas to be affected more profoundly. Yet, PTG is a multidimensional term (Tedeschi & Calhoun, 2004) , and mixed-method and longitudinal studies are required to understand how illness severity influences the PTG experience of COVID-19 patients.",

Therefore, the findings do not reflect the findings of all individuals with COVID-19, and different participants (participants from different backgrounds) may provide alternative perspectives on PTG. Second, since qualitative analysis was used in this study, it reflects the views of a small number of people. Therefore, we did not identify subgroups according to factors such as the time during and after the disease did not compare the difference in PTG. Third, as data collecting instrument, we employed a semi-structured interview with open-ended questions in this study. However, there is a risk that the researchers' questions throughout the data collection process would direct the participants' answers. Therefore, while evaluating research findings, this limitation should be considered. Fourth, persons who were infected by the COVID-19 virus continue to experience PTG, and due to the scope of this study, they were not included. Future studies should consider different samples and have multi-stage designs to better understand PTG in persons who were infected by the COVID-19 virus. Fifth, this study involved the opinions of people from different professions, however, this study investigated the PTG of neither healthcare workers nor groups witnessing COVID-19 deaths. We think that future studies may be diversified by including these groups.",
