The total protein was then minimized to a maximum root mean square deviation (RMSD) value of 0.3 A to avoid the steric clashes of added hydrogen atoms. 9 In silico molecular docking is a powerful technique to discover novel ligands for receptors of existing structures and it plays a key role in the structure-based drug design. Molecular docking plays a crucial role in the field of computer-aided drug designing, which screens for a small molecule and gives a targeted binding site of a protein. The molecular docking studies were performed for OZM G against the MAPK1 target. The structures were designed, and the binding interaction energies were calculated using score techniques. A more negative range indicates the effective confirmation of bounding ligand-target. OZM showed a stronger binding affinity.",
