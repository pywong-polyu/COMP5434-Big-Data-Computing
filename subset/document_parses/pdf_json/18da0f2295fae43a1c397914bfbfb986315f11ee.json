            "text": "The constructive alignment (CA) of university teaching is designed to encourage students to adopt a deep learning approach, which supports meaningful learning. The evidence is mixed, however, with some studies showing that students may adopt a surface approach even when teaching promotes deep learning. To add to the understanding of the relationships between CA and learning approaches, we explored with quantitative measures two potential implications from prior qualitative research. First, we assessed with a novel questionnaire if students' CA perceptions predicted adaptation towards a deep learning approach. Second, we explored relationships between deep approach adaptation and learning motivation, as well as perceived mental workload. 56 students from two second-year courses in different study programmes completed a learning approach questionnaire in the second (T 1 ), seventh (T 2 ), and the final fourteenth (T 3 ) course week. At T 2 and T 3, participants also rated the constructive alignment of the course, their learning motivation, and the mental workload. Regression analyses showed that ILO Clarity (i.e. being clear about the intended learning outcomes of the course) and receiving effective feedback were associated with a significant increase in deep approach scores from T 2 to T 3 . That deep approach adaptation was in turn positively related to learning motivation in terms of higher ratings of one's competence, the importance of high course performance, and course usefulness. Moreover, deep approach adaptation went with higher satisfaction of having accomplished one's learning goals, but also with stronger feelings of insecurity and stress. Our findings suggest that students' CA perceptions are meaningful predictors of learning approach adaptation that might eventually be developed into indicators of the effectiveness of CA implementation at the course level.",

[7] ) although such research is needed to maximise the benefits of CA. After all, the constructive alignment approach is premised on the assumption that students actively construct knowledge through their learning activities (e.g., [8] ). The level of constructive alignment that students perceive might therefore differ from the level the instructor intended (cf. [9] ). Consequently, research that includes students' CA perceptions might therefore help gauge the effectiveness of CA implementation (cf. [10] ). Against this backdrop, we investigated the relationships between perceived constructive alignment and learning behaviours in terms of students' approaches to learning (hence: learning approaches). Building on extant qualitative research, we explored over the course of a semester how CA perceptions are related to students' adapting their learning approaches from surface learning to deep learning and what the direct and indirect motivational consequences of such adaptation are in terms of learning motivation and mental workload.",

            "text": "Constructive alignment is intended to enhance the quality of teaching and learning and hinges on defining the outcomes students are intended to achieve. These intended learning outcomes (ILO) nominate specific actions students are supposed to perform. They may be expected, for instance, to learn to \"critically discuss the limitations of Self-Determination Theory\" in an introductory course on motivation theories. In an advanced course on motivation, students may be supposed to \"Generate from Self-Determination Theory solutions to a specific disciplinary problem in the workplace\". Different as those ILO may be in terms of complexity and difficulty, students will usually have to use several learning strategies in concert to process the content. They make, for instance, connections between the various pieces of information presented to them and with their background knowledge (i.e., generate inferences; [11, 12] ), examine the logic of arguments or usefulness of evidence [13] , and monitor their understanding [14, 15] . From the perspective of the Student Approaches to Learning framework [11, 16] , such learning behaviours reflect a student's deep approach to learning, which can be conceptualised as an instance of self-regulated learning [8, 17] . A deep learning approach is related to high-quality learning outcomes and study success [18, 19] . Students adopting a surface approach, in contrast, focus on memorising and reproducing fragmented units of information [15, 20, 21] , usually engage in only little reflection on their learning [22] , and have difficulties with new ideas [23] .",

Students had in their first year been introduced to the different learning approaches and had identified in an initial assessment their own approach. Students' deep approach scores were assessed at the beginning of the first, second, and third year, showing a linear increase from the first to the third year. As previous assessments of other study programmes had shown deep scores to decrease across study years, the increase in that case study was taken to reflect the fact that students had been given a variety of learning experiences that sought to promote 'rich', meaningful learning [29] . More recently, Rodriguez and Cano [30] found in a longitudinal study that between the first and final years of studies, students' learning approaches moved towards depth. Wang, Su, Cheung, Wong, and Kwong [31] compared in a pre-post design several courses of two study programmes. They found that deep learning scores increased in students enrolled in the programme that was rated as more constructively aligned, relative to the programme deemed lower in CA. Reversely, surface learning approach scores went up for students in the 'low-CA' programme, but not the 'high-CA' programme.",

Prior to that course, participants indicated the learning approach they had usually adopted in the previous courses of their programme. The authors obtained \"unexpected patterns\" such that, as supported by the course design, a subgroup of students adopted a deep approach. Another subgroup, however, rather used a surface approach although they had indicated having been deep approach learners in prior courses. Still another group displayed virtually no adaptation of their learning approach although the course in question differed markedly from those students' prior courses. Similarly, Pang, Ho, and Man [33] showed that Outcomes-Based Teaching and Learning (OBTL) impacted on the learning approaches of undergraduate business students by tracking students' scores after a semester's exposure to outcome-based teaching. Yet, whilst the number of students adopting a surface approach nearly doubled, no significant change was found in the number of students endorsing a deep approach. Some students had even changed from the deep approach to the surface approach that they had initially favoured the least. Finally, counter to the expectation that students would adopt a deep approach through their course of study, Habel [34] found no changes in learning approaches in one course over the semester, even though that course had been designed in accordance with constructive alignment principles.",

Even when the learning environment promotes meaningful learning, students may choose to keep or even return to a surface approach. These mixed findings might reflect that CA was better implemented in some courses than in others. After all, students' perceptions of their teaching-learning environment are related to their learning approaches [35, 36] and students are more likely to adopt a deep approach the higher they rate teaching quality [36, 37] . By that logic, a high proportion of surface-approach students would indicate quality problems and in principle, assessments of students' learning approach adaptation could serve as indicators of CA effectiveness and teaching quality (cf. [10] ).",

First, a-priori indicators of CA, albeit theory-based, were used in most studies, derived from analyses of programme descriptions, syllabi and/or from conversations with instructors. In case students' CA perceptions were collected, those data were qualitative. Second, whilst students' learning approaches proper were assessed with quantitative questionnaires, qualitative methods were used to explore the relationships between learning approach adaptation and motivation. Findings on students' CA perceptions and the motivational consequences of learning approach adaptation are therefore difficult to compare between studies, which limits generalisation. On this background, we sought to contribute to research in a CA quality management direction by exploring with quantitative measures two potential implications from prior qualitative research. First, we assessed with a novel questionnaire students' perception of constructive alignment. Second, we explored the motivational consequences of adaptation towards a deep learning approach in terms of learning motivation and of mental workload.",

            "text": "Our decision to assess students' perceptions of constructive alignment builds on Balasooriya et al. [32] and Pang and colleagues' [33] findings. In the latter study, students mentioned in focus groups as the most distinctive features of outcome-based teaching and learning (OBTL) the precision of the intended learning outcomes and the transparent assessment criteria. Although OBTL is concerned with aligning all aspects of teaching (ILO, contents, their delivery and learning activities, and assessments), students did not remark they saw the alignment of teaching-learning activities with ILO and/or assessments as important features of OBTL. Balasooriya et al. [32] concluded from their qualitative interviews that whether students adopted a deep or surface approach in response to the re-designed course had been co-determined by students' perception of specific curricular features. As different students perceived the same course in different ways, course characteristics that were established in the literature as generally encouraging deep approaches promoted a deep approach in some students, while they stimulated surface approaches in others. Taken together, these findings suggest that rather than being perceived as a single, unitary course characteristic, the individual CA dimensions might have distinct, separately identifiable effects on students' learning experience and eventually their learning approaches. Going by Pang et al.'s [33] findings, well-defined ILO and closely aligned AT might be particularly pronounced drivers of learning approach adaptation that help students gauge the usefulness of a deep learning approach. Therefore, we put forward our Research question 1: Do the dimensions of CA perceptions contribute differentially to students' adaptation towards a deep learning approach (hence: deep approach adaptation)?",

            "text": "As a second potential implication from those studies, deep approach adaptation might have both direct and indirect effects on student motivation. Speaking to direct effects, students who moved towards deep learning reported that seeing the relevance of what they were doing made learning easier and felt the active nature of the course was a motivation for learning [32] . Similarly, the outcomes-based course design appeared to give students a clearer picture of their learning progress and next steps, thus positively guiding their development and encouraging some students to study topics beyond the scope of the lectures [33] . Indirect effects on motivation may arise from students' perceptions of context characteristics such as the workload and task complexity associated with learning [38] . Illustrating negative effects, some of the students who kept or even returned to a surface approach perceived the reduction in lecturing and the increase in self-directed work that CA came with as less motivating and as \"too much of an effort\", whereas getting information \"given to you by some lecturer\" would be much easier [32] . Also, some students remarked that given their time constraints, they could only \"rely on reciting\", thus abandoning the more complex and costly learning approach [33] . Whilst neither study directly addressed positive effects, Kyndt, Dochy, Struyven and Cascallar's [38] findings suggest that a deep approach may be associated with lower mental workload perceptions. Students in a regular university course worked individually on several assignments that had been constructed and pre-tested to induce specific levels of mental workload, which comprises one's perceptions of the mental, temporal and motivational demands [39] of a task. Mental demands refer to task complexity and required mental activity (e.g., deciding, calculating, remembering, searching). Temporal demands concern perceived time pressure and motivational demands are perceptions how hard one had to work to accomplish a given level of performance. After each assignment, students completed a questionnaire on the learning approach they had adopted when they worked on that assignment and on perceived workload. Even for high-workload assignments, students with a deep approach reported lower mental demands of the respective assignments than students with a surface approach to the same assignment. More generally, a negative correlation emerged between a deep learning approach and perceived workload such that higher deep approach scores went with lower workload ratings. Conversely, higher surface approach ratings were associated with higher perceived mental demands [38] . On this background, we were interested in the relationships between deep approach adaptation and direct and indirect effects on student motivation. We assessed students' learning approaches, learning motivation, and workload perceptions at three points in time over the course of one semester to answer Research question 2: Is deep approach adaptation associated with an increase in learning motivation? and Research question 3: Is deep approach adaptation associated with a decrease in perceived workload?",

Several studies yielded evidence of that positive relationship between CA and a deep learning approach. Some studies showed, however, that students may adopt and keep a surface approach even when teaching promotes deep learning. These mixed findings might reflect that CA was better implemented in some courses than in others. Research on the relationships between CA and students' learning approaches may therefore lead to indicators of CA effectiveness and teaching quality. Our exploratory study was meant to help establish an approach for such research by exploring with quantitative measures two potential implications from prior qualitative research. First, we collected with a novel questionnaire students' perception of four dimensions of constructive alignment. Our findings suggest that those CA perceptions contribute selectively to deep approach adaptation. Higher ratings of ILO clarity and feedback effectiveness went with more learning approach adaptation, whilst the alignment of teaching-learning activities and of assessment tasks was unrelated to adaptation. As a second implication, we addressed direct and indirect relationships between deep approach adaptation and motivation. Indicating a direct relationship, adaptation was related to increases in competence self-perceptions, the value of effort, perceived course usefulness, and satisfaction with one's performance, but not to increased enjoyment of the course. A positive correlation emerged between adaptation and increased feelings of insecurity and stress, whilst adaptation was unrelated to changes in the perceived mental and temporal demands.",

Complementing extant evidence of motivation being an antecedent of learning approaches (e.g., [38, 43] ), our data suggest that motivation may also be a consequence of the latter such that adopting a deep approach may come with the 'benefit' of heightened competence self-perceptions but also with 'costs' in the form of experiencing increased workload. To the extent that instructors can positively influence both costs and benefits through the way they implement CA principles, research on the relationships between CA perceptions, learning approach adaptation and its motivational consequences might help develop novel ways of managing CA implementation quality.",

Still, the small sample size and the fact that we collected data in only two courses are limitations that need to be addressed in future research with larger samples. Given a mean observed effect size of .79 (Cohen's d for tests of means differences) in earlier research [29] [30] [31] -no statistical tests were reported in [32, 33] -that indicates strong effects [44] , it seems safe to assume a medium-level population effect size for CA-learning approach relationships. At an assumed Cohen's f 2 of .15, representing a medium-level correlational effect, the statistical power of our tests ranged from .81 (single-predictor models of motivational outcomes) and a mere .58 (four-predictor model of deep approach adaptation), i.e., were at or even far below the level of .80 that is usually considered acceptable [44] . Future studies with a similar design will require at least 129 participants to achieve a power level of .95 [45] . Beyond statistical power, larger samples allow for comparisons between, for instance, subgroups of international students. Given its steady increase in the past 20 years [46] , international student mobility has gained importance as a driver of international scientific co-operation networks [47] . Universities will therefore seek to counteract the decline in student mobility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic by, for instance, optimising their classroom teaching to meet the needs of international students and incentivise them to cross borders for the purpose of study [47] . Investigating the role of educational culture would be a worthwhile topic in this regard. For instance, learning beliefs and classroom behaviours have been shown to differ markedly between North American and European on the one hand and East Asian students on the other hand [48] , leading to different perceptions of the ease of engaging in certain classroom communication styles, which is in turn associated with higher levels of satisfaction with one's learning and with better grades [49] . In a similar fashion, engagement in constructively aligned learning activities and the workload they induce might partly depend on the learning culture students come from. Identifying such differences in future research could help instructors adjust their teaching-learning activities and/or assessment tasks.",

            "text": "Further research is also needed on the context sensitivity of CA perceptions. Two questions in this regard are (a) why students adapted their learning approaches only in the second semester half and (b) why the alignment of teaching-learning activities (TLA) and assessment tasks (AT), respectively, did not predict that adaptation. As a tentative answer, we suggest this pattern reflects the context-sensitive, interactive nature of the four dimensions of CA perceptions. The assessments (mid-term exam and final exam) were administered in the second semester half. The late adaptation might thus reflect a backwash effect (see [50] ) such that the exams influenced what and how students learned by letting them realise that deep learning would be useful. In that view, the 'assessment backwash' would have been a second source of information. It may have confirmed students' initial ILO-based perception (ILO had been announced at course start) that deep learning would be required, suggesting an additive interaction between ILO clarity and feedback effectiveness. Perceptions of TLA and AT alignment, on the other hand, might be necessary but not sufficient conditions of deep approach adaptation. If those alignment perceptions are above a certain level, ILO clarity supports adaptation towards deep learning but may not do so in case of misalignment. Although merely speculative, that perspective on CA perceptions seems plausible considering extant findings. Our results fit with Pang and colleagues' [33] finding that students perceived clear ILO and transparent assessment criteria, but not TLA or AT alignment as the most distinctive features of outcomebased teaching and learning. Also, in addition to the perceptions of a specific course, the general learning experience that they accumulate across different courses can influence students' approaches to learning (see Baeten et al. [51] for a review). This would help explain the late adaptation we found. Students may have experienced in some of their courses that learning outcomes were not aligned with assessments. Therefore, they 'waited' to gauge from the midterm exam and the feedback they received on and from it which learning approach might be most suitable. This seems plausible given the adverse motivational consequences of the 'wrong' learning approach that Leber and colleagues [52] found. They compared two parallel versions of a course (same lecturer, topics, learning materials, students from same year of study and programme). Students were informed at course start of the ILO, which required deep learning (e.g., being able to explain the theoretical concepts behind several psychological models, applying those models to optimise a specific learning environment). Also, an assessment on those contents was announced for a later session. In one group, that assessment was announced as an essay exam, which required deep understanding of the learning contents. In the other group, a fact-oriented multiple-choice test was announced, which primarily required recalling information, i.e., surface learning. Students in that misaligned group ('deep' ILO, surface assessment) reported significantly higher levels of feelings of pressure and tension than the aligned group (deep ILO, deep assessment). At the same time, the aligned group indicated higher feelings of competence.",

            "text": "Context sensitivity also appears to be an issue for future research concerning the motivational consequences of learning approaches. We cannot offer a compelling explanation why deep approach adaptation was unrelated to several direct and indirect motivation indicators. Further research is therefore needed into potential context-sensitive patterns that may underlie our results. Deep approach adaptation did not go, for instance, with higher levels of enjoyment. At the same time, fitting with the findings of Leber and colleagues [52] , adaptation was positively related to competence self-perception and perceived course usefulness. This seems plausible given the correlation between deep approach adaptation and students' frustration levels. Adopting a deep approach may not 'come easy' and put students under some stress, which is likely to limit the joy the learning brings. Still, as it is intended to foster meaningful learning, a deep approach can contribute to feeling competent and perceiving the learning as useful. There is some evidence suggesting that the adoption of a deep learning approach partly depends on academic discipline and course topic (see [51] ). Future research could therefore explore if the relationships between deep approach adoption, frustration levels, and course enjoyment play out differently in different learning environments.",
