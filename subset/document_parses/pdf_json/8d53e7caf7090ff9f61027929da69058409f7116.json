The traditional sources of risk for life insurers are uncertainty in interest rates, aggregate longevity or mortality, and policyholder behavior. A nearly constant leverage ratio from 1945 through the 1990s suggests that life insurers managed these risks well for decades when fixed annuities and life insurance were their primary liabilities. Life insurers manage interest risk by investing a significant share of their assets in long-term bonds. They manage longevity or mortality risk by offsetting annuities with life insurance. Uncertainty in policyholder behavior may be more difficult to hedge, but life insurers have decades of experience to assess the policyholder risk of fixed annuities and life insurance. Finally, life insurers diversify these sources of risk through unaffiliated reinsurance.",

Thus, variable annuities replace the key functions of defined benefit plans in individual accounts and employer-sponsored plans.

Hartford was bailed out by the Troubled Asset Relief Program in June 2009 because of significant losses on their variable annuity business. The risks associated with minimum return guarantees are not limited to the US. For example, Equitable Life in the UK failed partly because of guarantees that were too generous (Roberts 2012) . Perhaps more relevant to the low interest environment, many Japanese life insurers experienced significant losses because of overly generous guarantees in the early 2000s (Kashyap 2002) . Minimum return guarantees are important globally and represent a major share of life insurer liabilities in Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and Sweden (European Systemic Risk Board 2015; Hombert and Lyonnet 2017) . In these countries, the average duration of liabilities exceed that of assets by 5 to 10 years (European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority 2014), which implies significant losses if interest rates remain unexpectedly low as they have been since the European sovereign debt crisis through 2020.",

However, not all employers offer defined contribution plans, and some employees may not be eligible for pension benefits. In contrast, life insurers could play an important role in retirement savings, even for households without access to defined contribution plans. Households can hold annuities in defined contribution plans, individual retirement accounts, and non-retirement accounts. Table 2 reports the composition of US life insurers' liabilities in 2017. Life insurance and annuities in the general account each accounted for $1.2 trillion of liabilities.

Since then, the leverage of both life insurers and banks have gradually decreased to 90% in 2017.

Insurers then compute reserves as a conditional mean over the upper 30% of equity deficiencies (called CTE 70). This conditional tail expectation builds in a degree of conservatism that is conceptually similar to a correction for risk premia, but reserves do not coincide with the market value of liabilities.

Insurers are exposed to unexpected changes in implied volatility if they attempt to hedge the minimum return guarantees by rolling over shorter maturity options. A dynamic hedging program would be subject to basis risk because of model uncertainty, especially regarding long-run volatility (Sun 2009; Sun et al. 2009 ). In addition to basis risk, derivatives could expose insurers to counterparty risk. Although collateral could reduce counterparty risk, it increases the cost of the hedging programs (Berends and King 2015) . A deeper economic question is why the market for long-maturity options is incomplete if insurers would want to hedge such risks. A potential reason is that someone must bear aggregate risk by market clearing, and insurers may have comparative advantage over other types of institutions because their liabilities have a longer maturity and are less vulnerable to runs (Paulson et al. 2012) . Insurers, especially stock rather than mutual companies, may not want to hedge because of risk-shifting motives that arise from limited liability and state guaranty associations (Lee et al. 1997) . Another reason that insurers may not want to hedge is that existing regulation does not properly reward hedging of market value. Insurers report accounting equity under the statutory accounting principles at the operating company level and under GAAP at the holding company level. Therefore, hedge positions differ depending on whether the insurer targets economic, statutory, or GAAP capital. A hedging program that smoothes market equity could actually increase the volatility of accounting equity under the statutory accounting principles or GAAP (Credit Suisse 2012).",

Insurers compete in an oligopolistic market by setting the fee and the rollup rate. Required capital increases in the rollup rate because of a risk-based capital or an economic risk constraint. An adverse shock to the valuation of existing liabilities increases the shadow cost of capital and drives up the marginal cost of issuing contracts. The insurer not only raises the fee but lowers the rollup rate to reduce risk exposure. When the shadow cost of capital is sufficiently high, the insurer stops offering minimum return guarantees to avoid additional risk exposure.",

If insurers that suffered large increases in the reserve valuation were constrained, they have an incentive to move variable annuity reserves off balance sheet through reinsurance. Panel B of Fig. 8 annuities is positively related to the change in the reserve valuation. On the top right are insurers like AXA and Genworth that increased the reinsurance share of variable annuities as they suffered large increases in the valuation. This evidence suggests an important role for a risk-based capital constraint rather than an economic risk constraint. Koijen and Yogo (2015) find that insurers lowered fixed annuity and life insurance prices from November 2008 to February 2009, when falling interest rates implied that they should have instead raised prices. The average markup, relative to actuarial value, was \u221216 % for 30-year term annuities and \u221219 % for life annuities at age 60. Similarly, the average markup was \u221257 % for universal life insurance at age 30. This extraordinary pricing behavior was a consequence of two unusual circumstances. First, the global financial crisis had an adverse impact on insurers' balance sheets, especially those insurers with variable annuity liabilities. Second, statutory reserve regulation allowed insurers to record far less than a dollar of reserve per dollar of economic liability around December 2008. Thus, insurers could generate accounting profits by selling policies at a price far below actuarial value as long as that price was above the reserve value.",

Figure 9 shows the cross-sectional relation between changes in annuity prices from May 2007 to November 2008 and four measures of balance sheet shocks at fiscal year-end 2008. The figure reveals two interesting facts. First, most of the insurers lowered prices during this period, which is remarkable given that falling interest rates implied rising actuarial values. Second, the price reductions were larger for those insurers with lower asset growth, higher leverage ratio, lower risk-based capital relative to guideline, and higher ratio of deferred annuity liabilities to equity. Deferred annuities include fixed and variable annuities, whose minimum return guarantees were unprofitable during the global financial crisis. Koijen and Yogo (2015) rule out default risk as an alternative explanation for several reasons. First, the markups on term annuities are too low to be justified by default risk, given reasonable assumptions about the recovery rate. Second, the term structure of risk-neutral default probabilities implied by term annuities does not match that implied by credit default swaps in magnitude, slope across maturity, or variation across insurers. Finally, the absence of discounts on life annuities during the Great Depression serves as out-of-sample evidence against default risk as a sole explanation.",

Life insurers could report risk measures by line of business such as life insurance, fixed annuities, and variable annuities. In particular, they could report duration and convexity for interest risk, delta and gamma for equity risk, and vega for volatility risk. Because many insurers are part of global insurance groups, insurers could report consolidated financial statements with sufficient detail regarding minimum return guarantees, derivatives, and reinsurance to be able to assess overall risk mismatch at the international level. Standardized stress tests could be useful for monitoring potential risk mismatch and ensuring stability of the insurance sector. Stress tests could be reported at the level of operating companies, insurance groups, and state guaranty associations. Stress tests could focus on systematic financial risks such as interest risk, credit risk including a large-scale ratings migration, equity risk, and volatility risk. In addition, stress tests could consider changes in policyholder behavior such as a slowdown in lapsation and surrender rates in a prolonged period of low interest rates. Regulators could require insurers to hold more equity if the stress tests reveal fragility. The results of stress tests could be made public, at least at the level of state guaranty associations, to ensure market discipline.",

Assets and liabilities could be reported at market value instead of statutory accounting value to increase transparency and to reduce incentives for insurers to not act in the best interests of policyholders. At the same time, regulators could use long-term risk measures (e.g., value-at-risk or expected equity shortfall), instead of short-term risk measures that are commonly used for other intermediaries such as banks. Long-term risk measures recognize the long-term nature of life insurer liabilities that are not prone to runs and would avoid procyclical behavior such as asset fire sales. Of course, measurement of longterm risk is challenging and potentially sensitive to reasonable variation in modeling assumptions. Developing a robust framework to ensure the stability of the insurance sector is an important task for academics and policymakers.",
