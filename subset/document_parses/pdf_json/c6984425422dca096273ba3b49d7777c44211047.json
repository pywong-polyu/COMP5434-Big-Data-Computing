However, this represents a challenge after the first consultation because many parents present problems of time to attend the controls in the office, in addition to lack of tools to support monitoring from home, thus causing a high rate of dropout. There are telemonitoring applications for people with obesity that send data in real time, but they are focused on adults; they do not consider pediatric patients or their parents as agents of change. For this reason, TCO is presented as a mobile application for telemonitoring and control of overweight and obesity in pediatric patients, which facilitates the specialist in the communication, follow-up, and orientation of their patients through family members or caregivers, considering anthropometric indicators, automatic monitoring through rules, prescription of the food plan, and recommendation of foods and dishes of the season and region. A case study was carried out with two groups of 16 overweight and obese pediatric patients, one of them using TCO. The results show that the dropout rate was reduced by 38%, and both body mass index and average waist circumference improved by 4% and 3%, respectively. In addition, family members who did not dropout were surveyed, and satisfaction was obtained between \"High\" and \"Very High\" in the use of the application as an aid to monitoring and compliance with treatment.",

This causes a high early dropout rate without presenting improvements. Remote monitoring (telemonitoring) is a viable alternative to solve these issues.",

            "text": "On the other hand, the World Health Organization (WHO) raises among its strategic objectives to reduce childhood obesity, promote the development of technological solutions that facilitate the periodic control of body weight, and that bring together various components, focusing on the patient's family [1, 31] . Telemonitoring solutions are currently in development for overweight people that contribute to overcoming distance and time barriers by sending data in real time to health providers. These applications will make it possible to assess the patient's condition [28] . However, these solutions are focused on adults and other chronic diseases. Thus, no evidence of telemonitoring using anthropometric data has been found in overweight and obese children, counting on their parents as agents of change. On the other hand, there are mobile applications to support parents in the control of pediatric overweight and obesity, which also include videoconferences with specialists [23] , however, these applications do not allow periodic monitoring or evaluation of the status of the pediatric patient. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a TCO App, a web and mobile application for telemonitoring and control of overweight and obesity in pediatric patients. TCO considers three profiles: the nutritionist, the pediatric patient, and the patient's family. The application allows the family member to register data such as weight, to be sent in real time to the nutritionist who receives alerts/notifications of the results and statistics. This way, after an evolutionary analysis, the dietitian can record or modify the diet plan, send comments, receive feedback, schedule sessions, have videoconferences, and maintain dialogs through a chat. The application is also based on monitoring rules that propose recommendations, depending on the results of the patient, for the family member to evaluate. In this way, the child adapts to the nutrition plan and weight improvement challenges are suggested for the child to apply.",

Some parents were called in order to ask the motives of the dropout in treatment. In the traditional group, parents commented that they did not have time to go to the hospital, the lack of results (note that the problem did not reduce), and few food options made them lose their motivation. On the other hand, in the TCO group, the lack of time and issues with their internet connection were mentioned. In the end, the dropout rate for the traditional group was 63%, while in the TCO group it was 25%. Ergo, TCO shows a dropout reduction of 38%. After eight weeks, in the TCO group, the average BMI and WC improved by 6% and 4%, respectively; while the traditional group had improvements of 2% and 1% (See Table 6 ). Therefore, the group with the application obtained better results, specifically, a 4% reduction of the BMI and a 3% reduction of the WC. Similar progress results were obtained in [29] , where different behavior change techniques were applied in combination to nutritional interventions, obtaining as the main finding after 6 months an average difference of 0.53 kg/m 2 BMI and 1.45 kg weight between the groups that were part of their intervention compared to a control group to which they didn't apply tests. Therefore, it is considered that, at the same time of validation, the results for TCO improve in comparison to those obtained. As additional data, there were significant improvements in 83% of patients in the TCO group. Also, those with higher BMI and WC were the patients who decreased their weight and girth the most when completing the validation (See Fig. 9 ). The questionnaire (see Table 5 ) was applied to the relatives of the patients who remained in the TCO group (one of the parents was responsible for two patients). This way, the results obtained are shown in Table 7 . The results show that 100% responded with \"High\" and \"Very high\" to questions about aid to monitoring (Q1), compliance with treatment (Q2), and perception of utility (Q4). On the other hand, regarding usability, the average responses for ease of use (Q3) and frequency of use (Q5) are between \"High\" and \"Very high\". When asked, \"Would you recommend TCO (Q6)?\" 100% responded with \"High\" and \"Very high\".",

TCO considers anthropometric indicators that help to control and monitor, it performs automatic monitoring through rules established by the specialist, allows the prescription of a meal plan by the nutritionist, and recommends seasonal food and dishes from the region. A case study was performed in a nutritional clinic of a health center in Lima, with two groups of 16 overweight and obese pediatric patients, one of them used the TCO application and the other followed traditional monitoring. The results show that the dropout rate was reduced by 38% for the group that used the application in relation to the traditional monitoring group. Additionally, the TCO group improved its average BMI and WC by 6% and 4%, respectively, while its counterpart had improvements of 2% and 1%.
