This study aimed to construct and validate a radiomic signature based on CT scans to screen for lumbar spine osteoporosis. Methods Using a stratified random sample method, 386 vertebral bodies were randomly divided into a training set (n = 270) and a test set (n = 116). A total of 1040 radiomics features were automatically retracted from lumbar spine CT scans using the 3D slicer pyradiomics module, and a radiomic signature was created. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the Hounsfield and radiomics signature models were calculated. The AUCs of the two models were compared using the DeLong test. Their clinical usefulness was assessed using a decision curve analysis. Results Twelve features were chosen to establish the radiomic signature. The AUCs of the radiomics signature and Hounsfield models were 0.96 and 0.88 in the training set and 0.92 and 0.84 in the test set, respectively. According to the DeLong test, the AUCs of the two models were significantly different (p < 0.05). The radiomics signature model indicated a higher overall net benefit than the Hounsfield model, as determined by decision curve analysis. Conclusions The CT-based radiomic signature can differentiate patients with/without osteoporosis prior to lumbar spinal surgery. Without additional medical cost and radiation exposure, the radiomics method may provide valuable information facilitating surgical decision-making.",

Using CT scans to measure vertebral HU values has shown promise in previous studies. A low HU value may be associated with complications, such as pseudoarthrosis after lumbar fusion surgery [4] . Schreiber et al [5] found that the HU value obtained from a routine CT scan significantly correlates with DEXA results, and Zou et al [6] found that the HU value is a good predictor of pedicle screw loosening after lumbar fixation. Furthermore, HU measurement allows clinicians to screen for osteoporosis preoperatively without additional radiation exposure and medical costs [7] . However, HU measurements did not include the cortical bone in the method described; therefore, in the real world, this assessment may lose a significant amount of information needed to assess bone quality [5] . The mean HU value of the vertebral region of interest (ROI) may differ according to different observers. Cancellous bone is heterogeneous; therefore, HU based on axial sections may not accurately reflect the bone quality [2, 5, 8, 9] .",

In oncology, radiomics is mainly used for the non-invasive estimation of the clinical diagnosis and prognosis [14] . Recently, Wu et al [15] applied a CT-based radiomics method to predict the outcome of COVID-19 patients, and Mookiah et al [16] used the radiomics features derived from multidetector CT to evaluate the trabecular bone quality and osteoporosis in the laboratory. However, no study has assessed bone quality based on the high-throughput radiomic features extracted from routing CT scans. In this study, radiomic features were extracted from the 3D segmentation of the entire vertebral body, comprising both the cancellous and cortical bones to determine the efficacy of a radiomics model based on routine preoperative lumbar spine CT scans in screening for osteoporosis.",

First, the radiomic features with ICCs (both in inter-and intra-observer classes) > 0.75 were regarded as reliable and selected. The minimum redundancy-maximum relevance (mRMR) algorithm was used to determine the relevance and redundancy of each feature. The 30 features with the highest-ranked mRMR were selected to construct the model. The optimal feature subset was then chosen using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model (a selection method for linear regression). This method can shrink the regression coefficients and reduce some to zero; the remaining coefficients were applied to construct the final model. Tenfold cross-validation was used to tune the regularization parameter (\u03bb). Using the following formula, the radiomics score (Rad score) of each vertebral body was calculated. ",

Additional examinations or treatment should be considered in patients with a higher probability of osteoporosis. Some selected features, such as skewness in the first-order feature class, appear to be independently related to osteoporosis; however, it is challenging to reliably correlate a single feature with the pathological state [17] .

Some elective spine surgeries could be postponed after pharmacological intervention for osteoporosis. Bone mineral density can be derived from quantitative CT (QCT), ultrasound, and DEXA. However, the World Health Organization defines osteoporosis solely based on DEXA measurements. According to the International Society for Clinical Densitometry (ISCD) recommendations, the DEXA measurement should include the spine and hips, and osteoporosis should be diagnosed based on the lowest T-score between the spine and hips. QCT, which focuses on the cancellous bone, can be used to determine bone quality. The clinical application of QCT is often hindered by high economic costs and the required specific training [19] .

Cohen et al [21] performed a validation study of opportunistic osteoporosis screening with routine CT on a multiethnic Middle Eastern population. The sensitivity obtained was 76%, and the specificity was 74%. The efficacy of the HU model in this study is similar to that of previous studies. Furthermore, both the Delong test and DCA analysis showed that the radiomics model outperformed the HU model. Radiomics analysis based on routine preoperative lumbar CT scans could provide an alternative for bone health screening. However, this method cannot replace DEXA, which is still the standard examination recommended by the ISCD. Nonetheless, our method could alert spine surgeons to investigate and possibly treat osteoporosis. Currently, the procedure for radiomics analysis may seem complex; however, the progress of automated segmentation might allow the integration of the feature extraction and calculation into a software program. The radiomics method will eventually become a one-button operation. The present study demonstrated that radiomics analysis based on lumbar spine CT scans might be an effective method to screen for osteoporosis before surgery.",
