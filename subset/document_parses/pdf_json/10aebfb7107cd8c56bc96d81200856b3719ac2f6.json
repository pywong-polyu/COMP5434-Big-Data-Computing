Here, we characterize two small-molecule-compounds, named GRL-1720 and 5h, containing an indoline and indole moiety, respectively, which target the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro ). We use VeroE6 cell-based assays with RNA-qPCR, cytopathic assays, and immunocytochemistry and show both compounds to block the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 with EC 50 values of 15 \u00b1 4 and 4.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcM for GRL-1720 and 5h, respectively. Remdesivir permitted viral breakthrough at high concentrations; however, compound 5h completely blocks SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro without viral breakthrough or detectable cytotoxicity. Combination of 5h and remdesivir exhibits synergism against SARS-CoV-2. Additional X-ray structural analysis show that 5h forms a covalent bond with M pro and makes polar interactions with multiple active site amino acid residues. The present data suggest that 5h might serve as a lead M pro inhibitor for the development of therapeutics for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

As of December 14, 2020, more than 71 million COVID-19 cases have been reported in 220 countries and more than 1.6 million deaths 5 . Currently, except for remdesivir, which was most recently approved as the first proven emergency therapeutic for treating , no specific therapeutics are available. The hope that the COVID-19 pandemic subsides with \"herd immunity\" is likely to be disappointing. Moreover, it is not clear whether COVID-19convalescent people with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 are immune to reinfection. It is of utmost urgency to develop effective antivirals, therapeutics that mitigate the lethal consequences of cytokine storm and effective vaccines.",

SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19, belongs to the family of betacoronaviruses that includes SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 has overall~80% nucleotide identity with that of SARS-CoV 6 and the main proteases (M pro ) of these two viruses have 96% amino acid sequence identity (Fig. 1a) . Superimposition of the structures of the M pro of both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV shows near identity in their tertiary structures (Fig. 1b-d) . Identical amino acids are indicated in dark green; moderately conserved residues in light green and variable amino acids in light gray. The sequence of M pro of SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 used in the present study is completely identical to that of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB:6LU7) and shares 96% identity with the SARS-CoV (PDB: 2AMQ). The 12 amino acid residues that differ between the sequence of SARS-CoV's M pro and that of SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 are highlighted in pink. Other less conserved sequences are from M pro s of MERS-CoV (PDB: 5C3N), CoV-NL63 (PDB: 5GWY), CoV-HKU1 (PDB: 3D23), CoV-229E (PDB: 2ZU2) and CoV-OC43 (Uniprot: P0C6X6). Sequence alignment was performed using Multiple Align Show (http://www.bioinformatics.org/SMS/multi_align.html). b Conservation of each residue is mapped onto the surface of M pro structure based on the sequence alignment shown in (a). c While M pro s exhibit a high sequence conservation around the dimer interface in the center part of each protomer, the external part of each protomer shows high variability. d Omitted electron density (2Fo \u2212 Fc) of 5h, contoured at the 1\u03c3 level is shown inside the binding groove. 5h targets mainly a conserved site.",

The role of the two proteases is essential for the replication of SARS-CoV and both proteases have been recognized as attractive targets for developing antiviral agents [12] [13] [14] [15] . Based on the high structural homology, we examined potential activity of experimental M pro inhibitors, which had been shown to be active against SARS-CoV [16] [17] [18] [19] , against a newly isolated SARS-CoV-2 strain, JPN/TY/WK-521 (SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 ), in VeroE6 cell-based assay employing RNA-qPCR assay, cytopathicity assays, and immunocytochemistry. Indeed, the M pro of SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 (PDB: 6XR3) proved to have the same amino acid sequence identity with the M pro of SARS-CoV-2 (PDB:6LU7) (Fig. 1a) .

We specifically selected and synthesized a panel of active compounds based on previously known structures and their activity against SARS-CoV [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . We demonstrated previously that two compounds, GRL-1720 ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ) and 5h ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ), potently inhibit M pro from SARS-CoV and have anti-SARS-CoV activity 16, 20 . They also potently block the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV-2 M pro and the infectivity, replication, and cytopathicity of SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 ( Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3 ).

GRL-1720 is an irreversible, covalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M pro with time-dependent inhibition kinetic parameters of k inact = 2.53 \u00b1 0.27 min \u22121 , K i = 2.15 \u00b1 0.49 \u03bcM and a second-order rate constant, k inact /K i = 19,610 M \u22121 \u00b1 4,930 sec \u22121 (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b) . The IC 50 value for GRL-1720 after a 10 min incubation is 0.32 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM ( Supplementary Fig. 3c ). 5h on the other hand is a tight-binding, reversible-covalent inhibitor of SARS-CoV-2 M pro with a K i value of 17.6 \u00b1 3.2 nM as determined using the Morrison equation (Supplementary Fig. 3d ). As assessed using the quantitative VeroE6 cell-based assay with RNA-qPCR, the EC 50 values of GRL-1720 and compound 5h were 15 \u00b1 4 and 4.2 \u00b1 0.7 \u03bcM, respectively, and apparent CC 50 values were both >100 \u03bcM (Fig. 2) .",

For example, the anti-cancer/leukemia agent, daunorubicin (aka Adriamycin), was reported to be active against HIV-1 22,23 , but that anti-cancer/leukemia agent never proved to be of clinical utility as an anti-HIV-1 agent. Thus, we carefully asked if the three compounds, GRL-1720, 5h, and remdesivir exerted cytotoxicity at 1, 10, and 100 \u03bcM. As seen in Fig. 3 , VeroE6 cells cultured alone (top left in Fig. 3 ) appeared to be robust and had spread at the bottom of the microtiter culture plates; however, when VeroE6 cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 and cultured in the absence of test compounds, almost all the cells acquired granular patterns and became detached from the bottom of the culture plate (top right in Fig. 3 ), indicating the cells were infected and killed by the cytopathicity of the virus. In contrast, when the SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 -exposed cells were cultured in the presence of each of the three compounds (GRL-1720, 5h, and remdesivir) at 10 \u03bcM, the cells appeared to be moderately protected, and at 100 \u03bcM, all the cells appeared to be completely protected by each Fig. 2 The antiviral activity of GRL-1720 and compound 5h against SARS-CoV-2. VeroE6 cells were exposed to SARS-CoV WK-521 for 1 h, the virus was washed out, and the virus-exposed VeroE6 cells were cultured for 3 days. The viral copy numbers in the culture supernatants were determined using RT-qPCR. Red and black lines indicate reduction of viral copy numbers and cytotoxicity, respectively. Each compound was tested upon at least three different occasions. The data in Fig. 2 are representative ones. Both graphs were generated with Microsoft Excel. EC 50 values shown denote means \u00b1 1 S.D. All compounds shown in Fig. 2 were tested and compared in one assay performed in duplicate (n = 2). Source data are provided as a Source Data file. compound. All three images of the cells cultured with 100 \u03bcM of each compound appeared to be similar to the image of the cells cultured without the virus (top left in Fig. 3 ). Moreover, 5h, at 200 \u03bcM, showed no significant cytotoxicity in a human lung cancer cell line, Calu-3, or two human primary cells [peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and human bronchial/tracheal epithelial cells (HBTEC)]. In contrast, remdesivir showed cytotoxicity at 200 \u03bcM and its CC 50 value was 138 \u00b1 9 \u03bcM in HBTEC (Supplementary Table 1 ). When primary human airway epithelial cells were cultured in the air-liquid interface (ALI) setting in the presence of up to 100 \u03bcM of 5h and remdesivir, no detectable cytotoxicity was observed, although those cells were poorly susceptible to the infectivity of SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . These results strongly suggest that 5h exerts its potent inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations that do not bring about detectable cytotoxicity.",

In order to confirm and corroborate the potent antiviral activity of GRL-1720 and 5h observed using the quantitative RNA-qPCR assay, which often does not differentiate the actual antiviral activity from the misleading and distractive apparent \"antiviral effect\" caused by the cytostatic effect and/or cytotoxicity of test compounds, we employed immunocytochemistry, which can allow us to examine the antiviral activity of test compounds at the cellular level. For the primary antibody in our immunocytochemistry, we used an IgG fraction isolated from a COVID-19-convalescent patient, who proved to have high titers of neutralizing antibodies as well as SARS-CoV-2-binding IgG antibodies (Data not shown). As shown in Fig. 4 , when VeroE6 cells were cultured alone, robust cellular cytoskeleton filamentous actin (F-actin) was seen as mesh-like structures (shown in red) and a number of nuclei (shown in blue) were identified, signifying that those cells were healthy and replicating (top left in Fig. 4 ). However, when VeroE6 cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 and cultured in the absence of test compound, the F-actin structure was lost and a number of cells were infected by the virus (stained in green; top right in Fig. 4 ). In contrast, in SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 -exposed VeroE6 cells that were cultured in the presence of 100 \u03bcM GRL-1720, there was a significant reduction in the number of SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 -infected cells and there were essentially no infected cells when the cells were cultured in the presence of 100 \u03bcM GRL-1720. In contrast, in the presence of as low as 10 \u03bcM 5h, there was significant reduction in the number of infected cells and there were no infected cells when VeroE6 cells were cultured at 100 \u03bcM 5h. Remdesivir also significantly reduced the number of infected cells at 10 and 100 \u03bcM; however, there was viral breakthrough in the culture and some infected cells were identified. The viral breakthrough in VeroE6 cell culture in the presence of remdesivir is shown in higher magnification in Supplementary Fig. 5 . VeroE6 cells were exposed to SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 for 1 h, the virus was washed off, and the cells were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of test compound for 3 days. The images shown are those captured under light microscopy. VeroE6 cells cultured alone (top left) appear to be robust; however, those exposed to SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 and cultured in the absence of test compounds, a number of cells were destroyed by the cytopathicity of the virus and appear granular (top right). VeroE6 cells exposed to the virus and cultured with each of the two compounds, GRL-1720 and 5h (at 1, 10 and 100 \u00b5M). The virus-exposed cells cultured with 100 \u00b5M, all the cells appeared to be completely protected. Representative images from three independent experiments are shown. Scale bar = 200 \u00b5m.",

In the set of immunocytochemistry data, there was no virus breakthrough in all of the fields examined using Cell Imaging Multi-Mode Reader (Cytation 5) at concentrations 50 through 100 \u03bcM; however, there were obvious virus breakthroughs at 150 and 200 \u03bcM of remdesivir ( Supplementary Fig. 6 ).

Thus, we asked whether these two compounds work against SARS-CoV-2 in an additive or synergistic fashion in the VeroE6 cell-based assays (Fig. 5 ).

To understand the molecular basis of the inhibition of SARS-CoV-2's M pro by 5h, we determined the X-ray structure of M pro in complex with 5h at 1.25 \u00c5 resolution. The crystallographic asymmetric unit comprises a dimer form of M pro . The dimer interface is highly conserved among the eight human coronaviruses M pro s listed in Fig. 1a . Indeed, a number of previous studies reported that only the dimeric form of M pro shows enzymatic activity (Fig. 1b-d) 33, 34 . In fact, when we have gone over the amino acid sequences of M pro of 102 different SARS-CoV-2 strains isolated in 12 nations and regions, whose full-length viral sequences were deposited to GenBank at National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) by March 17, 2020, all strains proved to carry an identical M pro amino acid sequence to the M pro of NCBI Reference Sequence, NC_045512.2 Compound 5h combined with remdesivir does not permit viral breakthrough. VeroE6 cells were exposed with SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 for 1 h, the virus was washed out, and the virus-exposed cells were cultured for 3 days in the presence of compounds. a Viral RNA copy numbers in the culture supernatants were determined using RNA-qPCR. The numbers of viral RNA copy were more significantly reduced in the combination of 5h and remdesivir (each at 4, 10, 20, and 40 \u00b5M) than 5h or remdesivir alone. The mean EC 50 values of 5h and remdesivir determined with this set of the data were 4.0 and 9.0 \u00b5M, respectively. The figure was generated with GraphPad Prism 9.

In the X-ray crystallographic data collected, clear electron density of 5h ( Supplementary Fig. 8 ) was observed inside the binding groove stretching between domain I and domain II (Fig. 6a) . Detailed molecular interactions with M pro are shown in the Fig. 6b -e. 5h fully occupies all binding pockets and is stabilized by six direct hydrogen bonds with the residues inside the binding groove of M pro . Particularly, Glu-166 engages in the formation of two hydrogen bonds linking the main chain carbonyl and the amide group of Glu-166. In the central part of 5h, additional hydrogen bonds form with the sidechain oxygen of Gln-189 and the main chain carbonyl of His-164 (Fig. 6b, d) . Since the majority of hydrogen bonds form through the main chain carbonyl and NH groups of M pro , those interactions are less likely affected by potential mutations. In addition to hydrogen bonds, several hydrophobic residues contribute to binding affinity via van der Waals interactions (Fig. 6c) . Inside the S2 sub-pocket, the distal benzene ring of the benzothiazole of 5h is sandwiched by Leu-27 and Met-49. Overall, the chemical composition of 5h matches well with the surface of the binding groove in terms of the hydrophobicity scale. The observed continuous electron density of the tetrahedral ketal and the sulfur atom of Cys-145 indicates the formation of a covalent bond between 5h and M pro (Fig. 6e, supplementary Fig. 8) . The sulfur atom of Cys-145 undergoes nucleophilic addition reaction and forms a covalent bond with the carbonyl carbon (-C=O) next to the benzothiazole of 5h, resulting in the conversion of the carbonyl to an alcohol (-C-OH) and to the formation of one direct hydrogen bond and water-mediated hydrogen bond interactions around the three oxyanion hole residues, Cys-145 and Gly-143 (Fig. 6e) . Unlike in most structures of the free and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 M pro ( Supplementary Fig. 9 ), the \"catalytic water\", bound by His-41, His-164, Asp-187, and the main chain amide nitrogen of His-41, is not present in the structure of the 5h complex. This significant modification of the active site is caused by the shift of the side chain of His-41 due to its interaction with the benzothiazole of the inhibitor, creating a direct hydrogen bond between the imidazole groups of His-41 and His-164.",

We propose a similar mechanism for the interactions of GRL-1720 with SARS-CoV-2 M pro , which is outlined in Supplementary Fig. 10 . The catalytic His-41 and Cys-145 are involved in the nucleophilic attack on the ester carbon of GRL-1720. Following acylation, the chloropyridinyl group departs, and the carbonyl indoline moiety is bound to Cys-145 of M pro through a covalent bond (indicated by a yellow arrow in Supplementary Fig. 11) . The presence of a covalently-bound carbonyl indoline moiety was verified by electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-QTOF/MS)(vide infra). The predicted structural interactions of the carbonyl indoline moiety of GRL-1720 with M pro are shown in Supplementary Fig. 11 . The carbonyl carbon is involved in hydrogen-bond interactions with the backbone amine nitrogens of Gly-143 and Cys-145 ( Supplementary Fig. 11 ). Overall, 5h has multiple additional favorable interactions with M pro compared with that of GRL-1720, which may partially explain the much greater enzymatic inhibition and antiviral activity of 5h compared to GRL-1720.",

The increased size corresponds to the molecular weight of the bound 1H-indoline-4carbonyl group. In the active site of M pro , Cys-145 and His-41 appear to form a catalytic dyad (Supplementary Fig 10) . Consequently, the sulfur atom gains nucleophilicity, and presumably exerts a nucleophilic attack on the electrophilic carbon atom of the polar carbonyl group from GRL-1720. In contrast, no changes in the mass were identified in M pro treated with 5h for 30 min or 3 h as compared with M pro unexposed to 5h (Fig. 7d, e) . These data suggest that 5h does form a covalent bond with M pro as observed in the X-ray crystallographic analyses (Fig. 6) ; however, the covalent bonding is of a reversible nature as previously described by Vershueren et al. 35 .",

We also examined the thermal stability of M pro in the presence of GRL-1720 and 5h using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF). As illustrated in Fig. 8 , the T m value of M pro alone in Experiment 1 was 53.63\u00b0C, while in the presence of 5, 50, and 100 \u03bcM of GRL-1720, the values decreased to 51.03, 49.39, and 47.95\u00b0C, respectively (Fig. 8a) . The observed shifts of T m values to lower temperatures have reportedly been associated with an apparent destabilization of the protein by covalently-bound compounds [36] [37] [38] . Thus, these data corroborate that GRL-1720 forms a covalent bond with M pro . By contrast, the T m value of M pro alone in Experiment 2 was 51.17\u00b0C, while in the presence of 50 and 100 \u03bcM of 5h, the values increased to 53.50 and 55.01\u00b0C (Fig. 8b) . Interestingly, in the presence of 5, 50, and 100 \u03bcM of lopinavir, the T m values of M pro turned out to be substantially lower at 49.31, 48.64\u00b0C and 48.87\u00b0C (Fig. 8c) , suggesting that lopinavir does not stabilize M pro but rather destabilizes the protein. Of note, the interpretation of a decreased T m in the case of lopinavir is complex. In general, destabilizers have been largely dismissed and removed from detailed investigations; however, all such destabilizers have been summarily placed into the non-specific binder category [36] [37] [38] . In conclusion, these thermal stability data suggest that GRL-1720 forms covalent interactions with M pro , while 5h likely forms reversible covalent interactions 35 with M pro . Based on the X-ray crystallographic analyses and thermal stability data, it should be reasonable to conclude that 5h strongly interacts with M pro and potently inhibits its enzymatic activity as compared to GRL-1720.",

Both compounds target the main protease (M pro ) of SARS-CoV-2 and potently block the infectivity, replication, and cytopathicity of SARS-CoV-2 WK-521 as assessed using cell-based assays with RNA-qPCR, cytopathicity assays, and immunocytochemistry ( Figs. 2 and 3) . At a concentration of 20 \u03bcM, 5h completely blocked the infection by SARS-CoV-2, while remdesivir, currently the only FDA-approved emergency therapeutic for treating patients with COVID-19 39 , permitted viral breakthrough at the same concentration. However, when 20 \u03bcM 5h was combined with 20 \u03bcM remdesivir, that combination reduced the number of SARS-CoV-2 copies by the magnitude of 1.6 \u00d7 10 6 (Fig. 5) , strongly suggesting that as in the case of antiretroviral therapy of HIV-1 infection, in which the use of one or two reverse transcriptase inhibitors and an HIV-1 protease or integrase inhibitor resulted in highly favorable antiretroviral effects 40 , such a combination might give much more favorable efficacy than remdesivir alone or 5h alone. Of particular note, in the current study, we were able to sever the reduction of numbers of virus copy numbers due to the cytostatic/cytotoxic effects from virus-specific inhibitory activity of the test compounds. Our detailed immunocytochemistry experiments clearly segregated the virus-specific antiviral activity from the cytostatic/cytotoxic effects of the test compounds. We therefore conclude that no detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity is present in compounds such as HIV-1 protease inhibitors (nelfinavir and atazanavir) [25] [26] [27] and shikonin 24 that have previously been reportedly to be active against SARS-CoV-2. Thus far, over 80 SARS-CoV-2 M pro structures in the PDB and some of them have the authentic sequence of the N terminus, and some do not. A detailed comparison of all these structures we conducted indicated that the nature of the N terminus and its disorder bear no relationship to the mode of binding of the inhibitors. An additional structure of the 5h inhibitor complex in a different crystal form was determined at a lower resolution, but using a construct with an authentic N terminus (PDB ID 6XR3). The structure discussed in the present study (PDB ID 7JKV) and the structure in 6XR3 nicely superimpose with an RMS 0.68 \u00c5, and the substrate binding area is virtually the same. We also conclude that GRL-1720 and 5h completely block the infectivity and cytopathicity of SARS-CoV-2 by specifically targeting M pro of SARS-CoV-2.",

            "text": "Our structural analyses suggest that both GRL-1720 and 5h form interactions with several active site residues, including Cys-145 of M pro . The catalytic dyad, His-41 and Cys-145, is involved in the nucleophilic attack on the ester carbon of GRL-1720, and the carbonyl indoline moiety is bound to Cys-145 of M pro through a covalent bond (Supplementary Fig. 11) . Indeed, the presence of a covalently-bound carbonyl indoline moiety was verified with nanoLC-ESI-QTOF-MS (Fig. 7) . Notably, X-ray structural analysis revealed that the sulfur in Cys-145 of M pro undergoes a nucleophilic addition reaction by forming a covalent bond with 5h (Fig. 6) . However, it is also likely that 5h-M pro covalently-linked ketal converts to a carbonyl group with noncovalent binding with M pro in a reversible manner 35 . In fact, in our nanoLC-ESI-QTOF-MS studies, M pro and 5h eluted separately, indicating that they do not form a covalent bond under the conditions used for our nanoLC-ESI-QTOF-MS studies. Overall, both the covalently bound tetrahedral ketal as well as the noncovalent bound carbonyl form of 5h likely make a number of interactions with the active site residues of M pro . 5h makes multiple additional favorable interactions with M pro compared with GRL-1720, which may explain its much greater antiviral activity. Further, the thermal stability of M pro significantly increased in the presence of 5h, corroborating that 5h also forms non-covalent bond with M pro (Fig. 8) .",

A crystal structure of SARS-CoV-2 main protease (M pro )(RCSB PDB ID 6Y2F) was used for molecular docking of GRL-1720. The crystal structure was processed for molecular docking by deleting the water molecules and dimethyl sulfoxide. Hydrogen atoms were added, and appropriate bond orders were assigned to the protein atoms, and the bound inhibitor. The protonation states of the asparagines, glutamines, and histidines were determined. Using the OPLS3 force field (used for all geometry minimizations), a restrained minimization was performed (with a cut-off of 0.30 \u00c5 for root mean square difference of heavy atoms from the crystal structure coordinates). The above were performed with the Protein Preparation wizard present in Maestro. The structure thus obtained was used for molecular docking. The inhibitor molecule GRL-1720 was built in Maestro, and minimized conformations were generated using the LigPrep module. The covalent docking sub-module of Glide was used and a docking grid encompassing the volume occupied by the bound inhibitor from the crystal structure was generated. A nucleophilic attack by Cys-145 of SARS-CoV2 protease on GRL-1720 was chosen as the mode of reaction while determining the docked interaction poses. This was because the literature on SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 demonstrates that the active site cysteine undergoes nucleophilic addition reactions with formation of a covalent bond with appropriate functional groups such as a carbonyl carbon. Recent crystal structures also demonstrate that Cys-145 of SARS-CoV-2 protease forms covalent bond with inhibitors 24 . Subsequent to the formation of the covalent bond with M pro , GRL-1720, an ester, undergoes cleavage of the chloropyridinyl group forming a thiocarbonyl complex.

Structure file of 5h was generated using the Dundee PRODRG2 server 47 and manually fitted to the electron density. All structural figures were produced with PyMOL and UCSF Chimera 48 . The data were deposited into the PDB under ID: 7JKV.",

To detect the molecular weight of the M pro , analysis was done using a quadrupole-time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometer equipped with a Captive Spray electrospray ionization platform in the positive mode (impact II, Bruker Daltonics Bremen, Germany) with liquid chromatography (Ultimate 3000 HPLC, Thermo Fisher scientific). A sample (1 \u03bcl, 1 pmol) was separated on an Acclaim PepMap 100 C18LC column (0.075 mm \u00d7 150 mm, 2 \u03bcm particle) (Thermo Fisher scientific) over 35 min using a 2% acetonitrile gradient. Separations started with 95% buffer A, and 5% buffer B (acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid) to 70% buffer B and then ramped to 95% in the following 5 min and then returned to starting conditions 5 min later. The intact and modified forms of M pro eluted at 27 min. Following ion source parameters have been applied: dry Heater: 150\u00b0C, dry Gas: 8.0 L/min, capillary voltage: 1000 V, End plate offset: \u2212500 V. MS scans have been acquired at a spectra rate of 1 Hz at a mass range from 100 to 3000 m/z. Molecular weights by protein deconvolution were determined using DataAnalysis 4.4 (Bruker Daltonics, Bremen, Germany).",

Subsequently, 30 \u03bcL of the solution was successively heated from 15\u00b0C to 95\u00b0C, and the changes of fluorescence intensity were documented using the real-time PCR system (Applied Biosystems). The Tm (50% melting temperature) values were determined as the temperature at which the relative fluorescent intensity became 50%. Note that the thermal stability curves of M pro with 5h at the molar ratios of 1:10 and 1:20 shifted to the higher temperature (to the right). The thermal stability curves of M pro did not shift with lopinavir as compared with that with no agent.",

In general, inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 M pro by GRL-1720 and 5h was assessed using a continuous, fluorescence assay and the FRET-based substrate UIVT3 (HiLyte Fluor 488 TM -ESATLQSGLRKAK-QXL 520 TM -NH 2 ) (Anaspec, Fremont, CA). The assay buffer consisted of 50 mM HEPES pH 7.50, 0.1 mg/mL BSA, 0.01% Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT, 1% DMSO and a final enzyme concentration of 200 nM. Kinetic assays were performed in Costar 3694 EIA/RIA 96-well half-area, flat bottom, black polystyrene plates (Corning, Corning, NY) at 25\u00b0C. The increase in fluorescence intensity of SARS-CoV-2 M pro catalyzed reactions was measured at an emission wavelength of 528 nm (20 nm bandwidth) using an excitation wavelength of 485 (bandwidth 20 nm) using either a CLARIOstar Plate Reader (BMG Labtech, Cary, NC) or a Synergy H1 hybrid multi-mode plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT). The initial rates of the reactions were then determined from the slopes of the Relative Fluorescence Units (RFU) produced during the initial rate period of the enzyme by time in minutes, yielding RFU min \u22121 . Experimental details for the treatment of GRL-1720 kinetic data for irreversible covalent inhibition and 5h kinetic data for reversible covalent inhibition are provided in Supplementary information.
