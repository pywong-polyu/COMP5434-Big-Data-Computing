Speed and sensitivity of the FilmArray\u2122 Respiratory Panel (FA-RP) can improve care but may prompt inappropriate testing. Studies describing FA-RP use in pediatric BMT patients are limited; we investigated FA-RP use, results, and clinical management to evaluate clinical significance of testing in pediatric BMT patients. Retrospective analysis of 671 respiratory specimens from 204 unique BMT patients between 01/01/2016 and 01/01/2019 was performed. Age, underlying diagnoses, FA-RP result, reason for FA-RP, and symptoms were abstracted. FA-RP impact on antimicrobial management, scheduled procedures, infection control measures, and hospital admission/discharge were investigated. Impacts of repeat testing were evaluated. Two hundred sixty-nine out of 671 specimens (40%) tested positive; human rhinovirus/enterovirus (hRV/hEV) was the most common (161/269, 60%). The primary reason for FA-RP was URI symptoms (402/671, 60%) with 54% testing positive. One hundred twenty-two out of 671 (18.2%) specimens were from asymptomatic patients; 14 (11.4%) tested positive. FA-RP informed antiviral initiation in 7/19 (36.8%), 7/8 (87.5%), and 5/30 (16.7%) of RSV, influenza, and human parainfluenza cases, respectively. In 11 cases, FA-RP informed azithromycin and ceftriaxone initiation, continuation, or discontinuation. BMT was delayed for three positives (two RSV, one hRV/hEV). In 22 instances, negative FA-RP cleared patients for BMT. In 70% of cases, repeats offered no new clinical information; all negative-to-positive cases had new or worsening respiratory symptoms. FA-RP was ordered on symptomatic and asymptomatic patients, provided rapid diagnosis in > 50% of symptomatic patients, and informed infection control measures for all inpatients and antiviral initiation in > 80% of influenza cases.",

            "text": "Respiratory viruses are leading causes of upper and lower respiratory infections worldwide [1] [2] [3] . In immunocompetent hosts, illness is generally self-limiting, while immunocompromised patients are at increased risk for severe, life-threating infections [4] [5] [6] . Adult and pediatric bone marrow transplant (BMT) recipients are particularly vulnerable, and respiratory viruses can cause significant morbidity and mortality due to prolonged immunosuppression [4, 7, 8] . BMT patients often suffer from weakened humoral and T cell-mediated immunity, which greatly impairs antiviral immune response [5] . Additionally, BMT recipients show higher rates of progression from upper respiratory infections (URI) to lower respiratory infections (LRI) [8] . Further complicating matters, symptoms, and clinical presentations of respiratory viral illness are rarely pathogen-specific, resulting in a large differential diagnosis often including bacterial agents [2, 9] . Before widespread adoption of molecular testing, clinicians faced long turnaround times and difficult empirical treatment decisions when treating potential viral respiratory infection. The development and implementation of rapid molecular diagnostics have significantly improved detection and identification by detecting multiple targets at once, increasing sensitivity, reducing time to positivity, and subsequently decreasing time to clinical intervention [10] . Previous reports evaluating clinical impacts of rapid respiratory viral panel tests (RVPs) on patient outcomes have shown RVPs can decrease length of stay in the intensive care unit (ICU), duration of antibiotic use, and duration of isolation precautions, while other studies have reported no significant effects on antibiotic management [10, 11] . Furthermore, previous studies highlight inherent value for both clinician and patient \"knowing\" the diagnosis and halting potential unnecessary workup, testing, and/or treatments [12] .",

Targets include human adenovirus (hAdV); human coronavirus 229E (hCoV-229E); human coronavirus HKU1 (hCoV-HKU1); human coronavirus NL63 (hCoV-NL63); human coronavirus OC43 (hCoV-OC43); human metapneumovirus (hMPV); human rhinovirus/enterovirus (hRV/hEV); influenza A virus (IAV) including differentiation between hemagglutinin (HA) sequences of IAV H1, pandemic IAV 2009 H1, and IAV H3; influenza B virus (IBV); parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV-1); parainfluenza virus 2 (PIV-2); parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV-3); parainfluenza virus 4 (PIV-4); respiratory syncytial virus A (RSV-A); and respiratory syncytial virus B (RSV-B). FA-RP can also detect Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae; bacterial targets will not be discussed as we require confirmatory testing in our laboratory. Simplified workflows, high degree of accuracy, and speed have allowed implementation in a wide range of clinical settings. However, convenience and sensitivity present a double-edged sword: rapid turnaround times can improve clinical management, but gratuitous testing can increase burden on the laboratory and contribute to rising healthcare costs.",

Other reasons for testing included fever only, asymptomatic screening, lower respiratory tract (LRI) symptoms, and non-URI symptoms, i.e., nausea, diarrhea, ear pain, or malaise. A total of 138/671 (20.6%) specimens from 104 asymptomatic patients were tested for pre-procedural screening (BMT or other), general asymptomatic screening, or test of cure; 19/138 (13.8%) tested positive (Table 3) .

Those tested for \"cure\" of previous viral infection included 16 specimens from 15 previously positive and symptomatic patients, and a total of 5/16 (31.3%) remained hRV/hEV positive (Table 3) .

In these cases, azithromycin was used for anti-inflammatory/immunomodulatory effects based on provider notes, and all patients had abnormal chest X-ray (CXR). Patients were positive for hRV/ hEV (n = 3), hRSV (n = 3), PIV-3 (n = 2), PIV-1 (n = 1), or hCoV NL63 (n = 1). None showed evidence of coinfection and/or superimposed bacterial infection based on imaging, corresponding bacterial cultures, and/or molecular tests were negative. There were no instances where azithromycin was discontinued following a positive FA-RP. Azithromycin therapy was also noted in the FA-RP negative group including 17/402 (4.2%) instances in 14 patients. In 9 (53%) cases, azithromycin was initiated, and in 3 (17.6%) cases, the patient remained on previously prescribed course 3/17 (17.6%) due to abnormal CXR and/or concern for Mycoplasma pneumoniae. There was no documentation that the negative FA-RP informed these changes. To further elucidate azithromycin impacts, we compared proportions of FA-RP positive and negative patients where azithromycin therapy was continued or started. No statistically significant difference between the positive and negative groups was observed for addition of (p value 0.3) or continuing prescribed azithromycin (p value 0.6). Azithromycin was discontinued in 5/17 (29.4%) instances within 48 h of negative FA-RP result, but all were unrelated to FA-RP. In one instance, ceftriaxone was prescribed prior to the FA-RP being ordered due to symptoms of URI and was subsequently discontinued within 5 h of positive RSV. All other instances of ceftriaxone initiation, continuation, or discontinuation (n = 46) in both FA-RP positive and negative groups were due to medical reasons unrelated to FA-RP. Changes to all other antibacterial and anti-fungal agents were due to reasons unrelated to FA-RP test result, e.g., prophylaxis, empirical neutropenic fever treatment, other infection, or end of antimicrobial course.",

Based on our findings, most FA-RP testing is performed on BMT patients with respiratory symptoms, and in turn, respiratory symptomatology was the best predictor of test positivity. We report that a positive FA-RP \u2264 10 days preceding a scheduled BMT did not generally predict a delay in the BMT procedure with only three BMT procedural delays captured. In > 70% of the cases without procedural delays, patients were positive for hRV/hEV, which is often Fig. 1 Repeat testing outcomes. Repeat testing completed within 14 days (A) and 7 days (B) of initial test revealed that greater than 70% of repeats offered no new clinical information, regardless of days between initial and repeat test. Overall, 17 instances of new viral detection were observed with targets including 12 human rhinovirus/ enterovirus (hRV/EV), two parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV-1), one human coronavirus OC43 (hCoV-OC43), and one respiratory syncytial virus. There were three instances of new viral illness detection following a previous positive which included a human metapneumovirus (hMPV) to hCoV-OC43, a hRV/EV to hRV/EVh plu hCoV-OC43, and a hRV/EV to hMPV; all instances were seen in repeats completed past 7 days B A less severe than other respiratory viruses such as influenza or RSV [5] . It is important to appreciate that care of BMT patients is complex and decisions to delay BMT procedure is often a multifactorial decision that considers each individual patient's clinical scenario. A positive FA-RP result may contribute to a small fraction of the decision-making process; BMT delay in the three cases documented here was in at least part due to FA-RP outcome based on provider notes. Impact on antimicrobial therapy included antiviral and antibacterial management notably for the addition of ribavirin with or without IVIG, addition of oseltamivir, and addition or continuation of azithromycin. Azithromycin is well described to have anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory actions beyond antibacterial effects, and it has been reported to aid in viral infection management in BMT patients [19] . Although azithromycin usage was impacted by FA-RP in certain cases, positive and negative cohorts showed no statistically significant difference in usage. No other antimicrobials documented, other than a single case of discontinued ceftriaxone, were impacted by FA-RP indicating the importance of other clinical reasons in driving antimicrobial treatment or prophylaxis irrespective of FA-RP. In many cases, there was no documented evidence that FA-RP altered clinical management. Further studies comparing FA-RP usage in healthy versus immunocompromised patients particularly in the pediatric population are warranted to provide an immunocompetent comparator group to evaluate differences in management across patient sub-populations and better elucidate other FA-RP impacts.",

Most patients tested by FA-RP had respiratory symptoms; however, a number of asymptomatic patients were tested either for general screening purposes, pre-procedurally, or test of cure after a previous positive. As FA-RP indication does not include patients with an absence of signs and symptom suspicious for a respiratory infection, the utilization of this test in asymptomatic patients is a deviation from the manufacturer's recommendation.",

            "text": "Multiplex panels like the FA-RP are a double-edged sword in clinical microbiology laboratories. These tests are highly sensitive, fast, easy to use, and simultaneously test for multiple targets [2] . This allows providers to more effectively manage their patients than was previously possible with traditional methods or even singleplex, standalone molecular assays [10, 12] . However, these very same benefits can lead to overuse. Here, we report that repeat testing is not uncommon in BMT patients and > 70% do not offer any new clinical information when evaluated at both \u2264 7-day and \u2264 14-day repeat marks. A previous study in adults found that repeat respiratory panel testing had limited clinical utility [20] . However, given the lack of published literature, there are currently no national or international guidelines addressing best practices surrounding repeat syndromic respiratory panel testing. At CHLA, we employ a 7-day restriction on FA-RP re-orders, which was motivated by institutional specific laboratory stewardship initiatives. Our findings here could potentially inform institutional restriction extension to ~ 10 days without greatly impacting patient care based on results that repeats offered new information on average 10.5 days after the first test. Restriction removal could be informed by strict patient criteria that were shown in our findings to be associated with negative-to-positive results, including new or worsening respiratory symptoms or potential cluster investigation identified by infection prevention team. Additional studies are underway at our institution solely investigating repeat FA-RP testing across all patient populations to further develop potential guidance. Furthermore, multicenter studies evaluating implementation of such criteria would be beneficial to better understand the impact of such approaches and to potentially harmonize how institutions address issues surrounding repeat syndromic panel testing.",

Next, the notable limitations of retrospective chart review present challenges in evaluating nuances of undocumented patient care, and therefore, relevant information could have been missed. Although it's important to know how results from the microbiology laboratory inform care in our sickest patients, these patients are often complex, and the importance of \"knowing\" a diagnosis can provide the care team, the patient, and the patient's family piece of mind and halt clinical workup(s), which are difficult to measure in retrospective studies. Future prospective studies that directly capture decision-making processes of the BMT provider are needed. Lastly, our study only reviewed data obtained from the FA-RP panel which is not the only multiplex respiratory viral panel offered at CHLA; we additionally offer the Cepheid GeneXpert\u00ae Xpert Xpress Flu/RSV test. Additional studies to address impacts of multiple respiratory panels employed at the same institution, including the nuances of algorithm/reflex testing between panels not captured here, are warranted. Furthermore, comparator studies evaluating the performance of various multiplex respiratory panels available from different manufacturers/vendors would further elucidate variability in panel-specific detection rate(s) and clinical management within the pediatric BMT population to better understand best approaches for this highly complex patient group.",

Additionally, FA-RP informed clinical course in most cases an antiviral initiation was available, aided providers in determining if a delay in BMT or other procedure/treatment was necessary, and informed isolation/de-isolation procedures in all tested patients. Furthermore, we show that testing asymptomatic patients and repeat testing are common for BMT patients and often do not offer new clinical information to drive management. Multiplex molecular respiratory panels certainly have their place in modern medicine, and studies like this one are important to understand how clinicians utilize testing and the impact of results on specific patient populations and corresponding changes in clinical management.",
