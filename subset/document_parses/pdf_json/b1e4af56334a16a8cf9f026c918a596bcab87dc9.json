To date, studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy have primarily focused on hospitalized patients. Currently, there are limited data on longitudinal changes in symptoms over time and total duration of disease among the pregnant outpatient population, which includes the majority of patients with COVID-19.

There were no language restrictions, because consent was obtained through use of an official medical interpreter. Patients with COVID-19 who were in the intensive care unit on respiratory ventilators were eligible to enroll through proxy consent by the designated medical decision maker. If enrolled by a medical proxy, consent was obtained from the participant once she gained capacity. Written consent for Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations and release of medical records was obtained electronically (or mail or fax) using DocuSign. We recruited through promotion with professional societies and networks of obstetric care professionals and with social media campaigns (see the PRIORITY fliers [in English and Spanish] at https://priority.ucsf.edu/healthcareproviders and the Reproductive Health Equity and Birth Justice CORE at https://birthjustice.ucsf.edu/ reproductive-health-equity-and-birth-justice-core%C2%A0). On May 5, 2020, the Reproductive Health Equity and Birth Justice Core of PRIORITY was launched to focus on recruitment of Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, expanding the enrollment mechanism to include referrals from partnering community-based organizations and the PRIORITY Community Advisory Board. Enrollment was achieved through two mechanisms. Any participant could self-enroll through the PRIORITY website (http://priority.ucsf.edu). Alternatively, prenatal care clinicians (physicians or midwives) across the United States identified potential participants and provided them with information about the registry, Regardless of how the participant was referred, contact information of potential participants was provided to allow study staff at the coordinating center to contact them. After referral, participants underwent screening and eligible participants were contacted by a study coordinator by phone or email. Verbal or email consent was obtained per the institutional review board-approved protocol.",

Data on race and ethnicity were collected because of known disparities in maternal morbidity and mortality by raceethnicity. Participants reported the date of SARS-CoV-2 testing, onset of symptoms, and whether they were in the hospital. Participants were asked to indicate the first symptom that they experienced from a list of symptoms and queried about which symptoms led them to undergo testing. During weekly follow-up for 4 weeks, participants were asked whether they had received SARS-CoV-2 test results and to indicate whether they were currently experiencing any known COVID-19 symptoms from a predefined list of symptoms. Participants could also mark \"other\" for symptoms not listed on the form and write in additional symptoms. For the current analyses, we used the date of symptom onset and the date of study enrollment combined with weekly self-reported symptoms to calculate the presence of symptoms for up to 8 weeks after symptom onset. We adjudicated the accuracy of self-report of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosis through review of medical records and viral test results on a subsample of participants. Among polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test results for 140 participants, 138 (98.6%) were concordant with self-reports-119 PCR test results were positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and 19 were negative. Two participants (1.4%) reported that they tested negative for SARS-Co-V infection, but the PCR test result was positive several weeks before enrollment.",

For instance, in a nonpregnant population-based cohort of 1,099 patients in China, 4 the most common presenting symptoms were fever (43.8% on hospital admission) and cough (67.8%), compared with cough (20%) and sore throat (16%) as the most common first symptoms in our cohort, with fever present in only 12% of the population. One week after symptom onset among PRIORITY participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, cough (41%) and fatigue (33%) were prevalent but fever remained uncommon (5%). In a recent meta-analysis of 77 studies, pregnant patients with COVID-19 had a higher prevalence of fever (40%) as the presenting symptom than the prevalence of fever (12%) reported by PRIORITY participants. This difference in the presence of fever is likely because the meta-analysis primarily includes studies with hospitalized patients, who are more likely to be febrile, whereas 95% of PRIORITY participants are outpatients.",

            "text": "Of the group of participants who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection, 31% are Latina and 9% are Black. As a volunteer registry of patients with known or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection at the time of enrollment, our study design cannot estimate population incidence of infection. However, prior studies have found a higher incidence of and mortality from COVID-19 among Latino and Black populations across the country compared with White populations. 5, 6 Multiple factors may contribute to these racial and ethnic disparities in COVID-19 incidence and outcomes that have not been explored. The factors that lead to this discrepancy can to some degree be accounted for by historical and contemporary discrimination leading to economic disadvantages against people of color in the United States. 7 To date, there have been dem-onstrated differences in disease prevalence and mortality from COVID-19 affecting Black and Latino communities. 8, 9 For instance, Latina individuals may have higher rates of employment in \"essential\" positions, preventing them from sheltering in place. Despite pregnant patients having higher risk for severe disease with other respiratory viruses (H1N1, severe acute respiratory syndrome, Middle East respiratory syndrome), the data are less clear with SARS-CoV-2. 10, 11 Case series from China, the United States, and Sweden demonstrate the complete spectrum of lower, similar, and higher rates of morbidity in pregnant patients compared with the general population. 4, 12, 13 A recent metaanalysis found an increased risk of admission to the intensive care unit and ventilation among pregnant patients with COVID-19 compared with nonpregnant patients. The majority of our study population had mild disease, as indicted by their nonhospitalized status. This is consistent with other studies, which have also demonstrated that the majority of pregnant patients with COVID-19 have mild disease. 14 Known risk factors associated with severity of disease and poor outcomes with COVID-19 include medical comorbidities 15 ; however, in our cohort, patients with diabetes, hypertension, and other comorbidities were not more likely to test positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. We may have been underpowered to investigate these differences. Strengths of this study include the prospective design with unique self-reported longitudinal follow-up of weekly symptoms during the first 4 weeks of enrollment. Lack of known timing for clinical presentation has been highlighted as an evidence gap in a recent meta-analysis. 16 The large nationwide sample size recruited from every region of the country in a variety of practice settings is also a strength that supports generalization of study results. To our knowledge, this is the largest longitudinal cohort of ambulatory patients in the United States. However, this study does have limitations. Thirty percent of the study population are health care workers with associated high education level and income, and 60% of the population is White. This may limit generalizability of findings to the general population and to Latina, Black, and Native American populations, which have the highest incidence of and mortality from COVID-19. 17, 18 We are actively working with the PRIORITY Community Advisory Council and community-based organizations to increase enrollment of Latina, Black, and Native American patients. Other limitations include changes in testing availability over time based on participants' location and access during the study period, timing of testing relative to symptoms, and accuracy of testing, as discussed above, including both false-negative and false-positive results. 19, 20 It has been suspected that pregnant patients have a different clinical presentation of and mor-bidity from COVID-19 compared with the nonpregnant population. We demonstrate that the presenting symptoms in this primarily outpatient cohort of pregnant patients differ from those in nonpregnant populations, with a lower prevalence of fever and higher rates of fatigue, body aches, and headaches. Pregnancy also confers a prolonged course of disease for patients with COVID-19, where 25% of patients have persistent symptoms 8 weeks or more after disease onset.",
