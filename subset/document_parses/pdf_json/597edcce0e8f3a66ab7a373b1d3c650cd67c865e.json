            "text": "Understanding multiphase flows is vital to addressing some of our most pressing human needs: clean air, clean water and the sustainable production of food and energy. This article focuses on a subset of multiphase flows called particle-laden suspensions involving non-deforming particles in a carrier fluid. The hydrodynamic interactions in these flows result in rich multiscale physics, such as clustering and pseudo-turbulence, with important practical implications. Theoretical formulations to represent, explain and predict these phenomena encounter peculiar challenges that multiphase flows pose for classical statistical mechanics. A critical analysis of existing approaches leads to the identification of key desirable characteristics that a formulation must possess in order to be successful at representing these physical phenomena. The need to build accurate closure models for unclosed terms that arise in statistical theories has motivated the development of particle-resolved direct numerical simulations (PR-DNS) for model-free simulation at the microscale. A critical perspective on outstanding questions and potential limitations of PR-DNS for model development is provided. Selected highlights of recent progress using PR-DNS to discover new multiphase flow physics and develop models are reviewed. Alternative theoretical formulations and extensions to current formulations are outlined as promising future research directions. The article concludes with a summary perspective on the importance of integrating theoretical, modeling, computational, and experimental efforts at different scales. *",

They permeate practically every aspect of human life and an improved understanding of multiphase flows can play an important role in ensuring three vital needs of humans-clean air, clean water and sustainable food production-that are foundational to quality of life. Improved understanding of multiphase flows leads to better prediction of key phenomena in the natural environment and in man-made systems. Accurate prediction, in turn, opens the door to control of multiphase flows in order to achieve desired outcomes. Traditionally, multiphase flow control has been explored in the context of industrial devices [1] [2] [3] but there is also recent interest in climate engineering [4] [5] [6] . Of particular topical interest in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic is the accurate prediction and control of droplet dispersion caused by exhalation of human breath, and its implications for transmission of respiratory diseases in various settings.",

            "text": "Thermochemical processing of biomass to produce bio-oil involves heating biomass in an inert environment to extract the volatile components which are subsequently filtered and condensed into bio-oil. Biomass is injected into a bed of sand particles which is heated by heat transfer from the reactor walls and fluidized by the up-flow of hot nitrogen gas. Process heat both adds to the cost of producing bio-oil and heating of the reactor surface area is a bottleneck to scaling up the reactor and limits biomass throughput. Autothermal pyrolyis is a promising modification of traditional biomass pyrolysis that promises, on the basis of laboratory scale studies, to reduce the cost of bio-oil from $ 3.27 per gallon to $ 2.58 per gallon by quintupling the reactor feed rate and halving the reactor cost per tonne of biomass processed [8] [9] [10] . In autothermal pyrolysis, the heat needed to devolatilize biomass is provided volumetrically by exothermic gas-phase reactions that are initiated by introducing small amounts of oxygen into the inert atmosphere, without drastically affecting product yield. The challenge is how to successfully scale this reacting multiphase flow process from laboratory scale, with biomass throughput of milligrams per hour, to pilot scale (kg/hour) to commercial plant scale (tons/hour), while recognizing that the hydrodynamics of a fluidized bed change with scale [11] . There is also a complex interaction between the chemical reaction kinetics (as yet, poorly characterized in the low temperature range of interest) and the hydrodynamics, that can also vary with scale, and which can affect the trade-off between efficiency of volumetric heat generation while not compromising the yield of bio-oil. For example, an important design question that engineers face is where to place the biomass injection inlet in order to maximize bio-oil yield and biomass throughput?",

In such gas-solid reactors it is important to be able to accurately predict the conversion rate given the high cost of the sorbent particles and the need to reduce the level of effluent contaminants [12] . Existing models for interphase mass transfer are often specific experimentally-based empirical correlations for the reactor system under consideration because correlations for the mass transfer coefficient between the solid and gas phases in the literature differ by up to 7 orders of magnitude. The same is true for gas-solid heat transfer coefficients as well [13] . The wide variation in reported mass transfer coefficients in the existing literature is attributed to flow regime differences [12] . Clustering of particles inhibits gas-solid contacting and diffusion of CO 2 from the gas stream to the particle surface, which reduces the overall efficiency of the device. An important question confronting process designers is the prediction of clusters and heat and mass transfer in this application to maximize conversion and throughput.",

This image is at the boundary of the flow obtained through a transparent riser but owing to the high solid loading in these flows it is difficult to obtain such non-intrusive measurements in the interior of such flows. The macroscale behavior can change quite dramatically when the problem parameters such as the inlet gas velocity and solids flux are varied [15] , and it is yet unknown to what extent the structures at different scales influence each other. The level of simulation fidelity at each scale that is needed to predict macroscale behavior is also not known. There are indications that mesoscale structures affect macroscale behavior, and that microscale interactions can in turn affect mesoscale structures, but a definitive quantification of these influences is still an outstanding problem.",

Sprays have been studied extensively in the context of internal combustion and gas turbine engines. They also find wide applications in agriculture for spraying pesticides on crops, in advanced manufacturing, coating applications, pharmaceutical and healthcare applications and other processing operations such as drying. Of late, droplet-laden flows have come into prominence because of the COVID-19 pandemic and questions concerning the transport of the SARS-n-CoV-2 virus, and other similar pathogens. Prediction of droplet dispersion from human breath and its interaction with masks and face shields as well as airflow in groups of people in different settings, such as a restaurant, airplane or schoolroom, can lead to more effective control and mitigation strategies.",

Multiphase gasliquid flows are frequently encountered in the chemical and nuclear industry [16] [17] [18] . Multiple chemical processes are performed in bubble column reactors, which are vessels filled with liquid reactants, where the gas-phase is fed by means of a distribution system, specifically studied to create a bubble size distribution that maximizes the bubble surface area. Heat and mass transfer phenomena are key elements of the processes in these reactors due to the high exchange efficiency that characterizes these systems [16, 19] . Important examples are the Fischer-Tropsch process [20] , polymerization reactions, and oxidation and hydrogenation [21] [22] [23] [24] processes, and biochemical processes (fermentation [19, 24] , wastewater treatment, production of antibiotics, proteins and enzymes [19, 25] , algae growth [26] [27] [28] ). Bubbly flows are also particularly relevant to the nuclear industry [17, 29] , where safety of design and operation motivated some of the early developments in multiphase flow modeling. Typical operating conditions of these devices involve gas phase volume fractions between 5 and 40%. Engineers rely on models to predict the behavior of these flows in large-scale systems. Bubbly flows also exhibit a multiscale structure and diverse phenomena over the range of operating parameters [30] .",

Wang et al. [32] have extended this approach by adding a minute concentration (\u223c 1%) of a heavy liquid (hydrofluoroether) to a water-based turbulent convection system resulting in heat transfer that supersedes turbulent heat transport by up to 500%.

In these multiphase flows the particles are usually modeled as point particles, representing point sources of mass, momentum and heat transfer. Here we focus on particle-laden suspensions with inertial solid particles with sizes in the range of 100 to 500 microns that can be larger than the smallest scales of fluid motion, which in the case of turbulent flow is the Kolmogorov scale. In this regime the point particle approximation is no longer valid and a particle-resolved description of the flow field is needed. The interaction of finite size particles with flows where the mean motion of the fluid with respect to the particles is non-zero leads to interesting and important new physics arising from interacting wakes, the details of which are neglected in earlier studies of point particles in homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. The multiphase flow applications described earlier involve solid volume fractions that range from very dilute to close-packed, and so the range of solid volume fraction considered here must far exceed that in earlier studies of dilute particle suspensions. Higher solid volume fractions bring into play additional particle-fluid interactions which are detailed in Sec. II 2. These make the problem considerably more challenging than dilute suspensions. In order to establish a precise definition of the problem, we first examine a mathematical description of a particle-laden suspension.",

Isolated single particle studies highlight the principal hydrodynamic effect that the fluid has on a particle, namely to exert a drag force on it. Newton's third law requires that the particle also exerts an equal and opposite force on the fluid. When a fluid interacts with an ensemble of particles, this force exerted by particles on the fluid can be neglected if the mass loading (or phase mass ratio [37] ) of the particles is much less than unity. In these so-called dilute systems, the assumption of a one-way coupling is sufficient. In one-way coupling, the dynamical equation for the particle motion accounts for the force exerted by the fluid, but the force exerted by particles on the fluid is neglected. It should be noted that particles also displace fluid volume and it is expected that this volume-displacement effect can be neglected if the solid phase volume fraction is small ( [38] ). However, the averaged fluid-phase mass conservation equation reveals that an additional restriction arises from the gradient of particle volume fraction as well [39] .",

Traditionally, the inclusion of particle-particle interactions due to collisions on contact has been termed four-way coupling [40] . In the examples of fluidized bed applications described in Sec.

            "text": "The fundamental question concerning particle-laden suspensions is whether we can understand and predict macroscale phenomena arising from a collection of particles in fluid flow from the microscale description detailed in Sec. II 1, and if we can do this for the case of finite size particles interacting with a laminar or turbulent flow over a wide range of solid volume fraction? This is properly the domain of statistical mechanics. Theoretical descriptions of particle-laden suspensions draw from two principal branches of physics: (i) statistical physics of many-particle systems [41] , in particular the kinetic theory of gases [42] , and (ii) statistical fluid mechanics of single-phase turbulent flow [43, 44] . It is worthwhile to reflect at this point that insofar as particle-laden suspensions is concerned, the success of early theoretical descriptions [45] [46] [47] in answering the fundamental statistical mechanics question as it pertains to dilute suspensions in Stokes flow has been slow to be generalized. In other words, unlike the remarkable success of the kinetic theory of gases in predicting the transport properties of simple gases (see e.g. the diffusivity of CO 2 in Liboff [42] ), there are fewer definitive analytical results of broad applicability in particle-laden suspensions. In part, this is because multiphase flows involve many parameters, such as the volume fraction and density ratio to name a few, and the principal physical interactions change significantly across the parameter space, thereby making it difficult to develop a general theory with broad applicability. Another reason is that much of the information needed to complete these theories, which involves developing closure models for unclosed terms, is intractable analytically and must therefore be obtained from computational studies [48] . In this regard, careful use of machine learning tools [49, 50] can help map out the form of these unclosed terms over the entire parameter space and help complete these theories. It seems appropriate at this point to recall an appropriately reworded statement [51] by the eminent fluid mechanician, the late John Lumley (1930 Lumley ( -2015 , that underpins my expectation of theoretical approaches to multiphase flows: \"I believe in the ultimate possibility of developing general computational statistical mechanical procedures based on first principles; and under certain circumstances I believe that it is possible to do this rationally.\" 1",

Theoretical approaches to particle-laden suspensions have also been considered by representing both the dispersed and carrier phases as random fields (RF) in the Eulerian frame of reference [54, 55] . Prior to the rigorous analysis of Drew [54] based on ensemble-averaging, conservation equations in the Eulerian frame of reference were also derived on the basis of volume-averaging by Anderson and Jackson [56] and time-averaging by Ishii [57] . Historically there has been some controversy about the validity of, and inter-relationship between, these approaches [58] . Since the equations obtained from ensemble-averaging and volume-averaging look superficially similar they are used interchangeably in the literature, but they are fundamentally different. Later in this section we will see that the RF basis yields a formal relationship between the deterministic ensemble-averaged equations and their stochastic volume-averaged counterparts, which opens the door for modeling based on stochastic partial differential equations.",

This seemingly minor variation to straightforward volume averaging is in fact deserving of a separate classification as a third approach to modeling and simulation of particle-laden suspensions, whose origins also lie in single-phase fluid turbulence. Spatial filtering of turbulence fields leads to large-eddy simulation (LES) [44, 59, 60] methods, which have proved to be very successful in computation of turbulent single-phase flow [61] [62] [63] . Capecelatro and Desjardins [64] extended the spatial filtering in Anderson & Jackson's [56] volume-averaging approach to particle-laden suspensions and formulated the volume-filtered Euler-Lagrange (VFEL) method. Although VFEL and LES share a common basis in spatial filtering of the governing equations, the differences in multiscale nature of fluid turbulence and particleladen suspensions inform the nature of the approximations and models that are needed. A brief summary of these approaches is provided below with a view to assessing their adequacy in capturing the rich physics described in the preceding section.",

In this sense, the NDF equation with a BE closure for the collision term is already time-averaged over a time scale larger than the duration of a collision but smaller than the time between collisions [67] , and this point will become relevant when we consider numerical simulations of Eqs.

Simple scaling estimates of the terms representing interparticle collisions and fluid-particle drag in the NDF lead to the identification of the principal nondimensional groups [37]-the particle Knudsen number (Kn p = \u03c4 c U p /L), the particle Mach number (Ma = U p / \u0398 p ), and the Stokes number (St = \u03c4 p /\u03c4 f )-that characterize gas-solid flow. The particle Knudsen number characterizes the ratio of the time between collisions to the characteristic time that a particle takes to traverse a characteristic hydrodynamic length scale L (over which mean and second moments vary spatially) with a characteristic velocity based on the particle granular temperature \u0398 p . The particle Mach number characterizes the ratio of a characteristic mean particle velocity scale U p to a characteristic velocity based on the particle granular temperature \u0398 p , while the Stokes number characterizes the ratio of a characteristic particle momentum response time \u03c4 p to a characteristic fluid momentum response time \u03c4 f . This allows the delineation of important regimes of gas-solid flow in terms of these nondimensional groups [37] , resulting in: (a) flows dominated by collisions (Kn p < 0.1) or convective transport; (b) low Mach number collisional flows and high Mach number flows characterized by shocks in the particle phase; and (c) low Stokes number and high Stokes number flows with the associated characteristic spatial distribution of particles in the flow field [68] .",

However, since a particleladen suspension may violate the particle Knudsen number restriction in some parts of the flow, these models are not uniformly valid. Quadrature-based moment methods have emerged as a powerful alternative to tackle regions dominated by convective transport by directly computing the collision integral through quadrature summation, thus eliminating the need to assume Kn p < 0.1 [70, 71] .

Unlike constant density single-phase turbulent flows where fluid particles are space-filling with fluid (material) volume always equaling the geometric volume, multiphase flows must deal with the additional challenge that particle number and volume fraction (or bulk density) are random measures. Although the average of the counting measure N (A ) yields a first-order theory based on the average number N (A ) , and its density the NDF or one-particle density f (x, v, t) (and from it the average number density n(x, t)), a major limitation of the NDF equation is that it cannot account for fluctuations in number.",

For ease of modeling and computational representation of boundary conditions, a solution approach based on Lagrangian particle methods is commonly used to indirectly solve the evolution of the NDF (cf. Eq. 7) in a computationally efficient manner [39, [78] [79] [80] . The Lagrangian-Eulerian (LE) method corresponds to a closure of the SPP representation at the level of the droplet distribution function or number density function (NDF), with the carrier phase represented in an Eulerian frame through a Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) closure, LES or DNS. The influence of the dispersed phase on the carrier phase is represented by the addition of interphase coupling source terms to the usual fluid-phase RANS, LES or DNS equations. The overarching challenge common to all SPP modeling approaches, be it the one-particle/NDF equation or the transport equation for the two-particle density, is that there is no joint statistical representation of fluid and particles in the SPP description. This constitutes a fundamental limitation of the SPP approach. Given that the interaction between fluid and finite-size particles is fundamentally a two-point phenomenon [65, 81] , representing and modeling this coupling at the singlepoint level is challenging. We will now examine the relative merits of the RF approach in capturing the rich physics of particle-laden suspensions.",

It is shown that the volume average is a random quantity that differs from the nonrandom ensemble average by a stochastic fluctuation. For statistically homogeneous flows it is shown that volumeaveraged particle properties such as the particle geometric volume converge to their ensemble-averaged counterparts as 1/ N (V m ). In the case of statistically inhomogeneous flows, a separation of scales is needed to ensure a similar relationship between the volume average and the local ensemble average and this criterion is explicitly established. The volume average of particle geometric volume is used to derive the weak form of mass conservation for the particle phase. This equation can be interpreted as the ensemble-average mass conservation equation representing a balance between the temporal derivative of ensemble-averaged particle volume and average flux of the same quantity at the system boundary, augmented by the temporal derivative of the stochastic fluctuation which is balanced by a flux fluctuation which varies with each realization of the multiphase flow. The stochastic fluctuation term contains important information about second-order fluctuations in particle number and volume which is absent in first-order ensemble-averaged quantities such as the ensemble-averaged particle number density and volume fraction.",

Attempts to improve the single-point statistical description of single-phase turbulent flow by resorting to higher levels of closure have led from the Reynolds-averaged equations to Reynolds-stress transport equations involving second moments, and culminated in the transport equation for the single-point probability density function [44] . In the case of riser flows involving particle-laden suspensions (see Fig. 1 ), Hrenya and Sinclair [85] showed that an additional transport equation for the particle velocity variance is necessary to predict phenomena such as the core-annular structure. Similar efforts to extend the EE TF theory beyond average quantities have led to second-moment closures [86] [87] [88] as well as the single-point PDF approach [55] . It is worth noting that these single-point second-moment and PDF closures are still at the level of first-order ensemble-averaged quantities such as the ensemble-averaged particle number density and volume fraction, and do not contain information concerning fluctuations in particle number (or volume). Pai and Subramaniam [55] showed that the ensemble-averaged EE TF equations of Drew [54] can be derived from the singlepoint PDF approach and the consistency conditions for the correspondence of mean and second-moment equations between the RF and SPP approaches were established. Fox [89] derived a multiphase turbulence theory based on a sequential phase and Reynolds averaging procedure starting from a mesoscale description based on a continuous volume fraction field. Although this approach is useful at the macroscale in incorporating mesoscale fluctuations, it does not reconcile with the microscale picture derived here.",

The latter are useful in distinguishing a key difference between the RF approach in multiphase flow and constant-density single-phase turbulent flow which is overlooked in some theoretical treatments. In constant-density single-phase flow, two-point statistics such as the Eulerian velocity autocovariance reduce to the single-point Reynolds stress tensor in the limit of zero pair separation distance because the underlying measure is not random, so lim r\u21920 R ij (x, x+r) = R ij (x). The same is not true for multiphase flows where certain two-point statistics such as fluid-particle velocity covariance vanish at zero separation, e.g. lim r\u21920 R pf ij (x, x + r) = 0, because particle and fluid cannot coexist at the same physical location and the two-point statistic is based on a different measure [75] . The analysis of events and probabilities in the single-point RF approach reveals that correlation between gas-and solid-phase motions does not manifest at the single-point level of closure, because for particles of finite size, every space-time location can be occupied only by either solid or gas [90] . However, these correlations do appear in the two-point representation.",

However, the mechanisms that produce fluid velocity fluctuations, for instance, at the microscale are different from the interaction of particle clusters with fluid flow at the mesoscale, or the interphase interaction at the macroscale. Since the single-point RF approaches do not contain scale information they cannot distinguish between these different scale-dependent mechanisms that contribute to the transport of fluid velocity fluctuations. Just as two-point statistics and spectral closures were introduced in single-phase turbulent flow to account for the multiscale nature of turbulence, similar attempts [75] have been made to account for the multiscale nature of particle-fluid interactions in particle-laden suspensions.",

For instance, the stability theory developed by Koch [47] analyzes the stability of a suspension in terms of the average solid volume fraction \u03c6 , and stability limits are derived on the basis of perturbations to \u03c6 about a base state. However, it is clear from both simulations and experiment that there is a natural statistical variability to the particle volume \u03a6 p from one realization to another, and it is probable that the origin of instabilities in particle-laden suspensions lies in the microscale interactions related to volume fraction fluctuations, rather than mean perturbations. Therefore, a more realistic stability theory must arrive at stability limits that account for the variance of volume fraction fluctuations which are related to the second-order structure. Whether this can be captured by a two-point theory, or if ensemble-averaging obscures the interaction between the two phases on each realization has not been definitively established. However, current analysis of the two-point theory [95] and VFEL simulations [96] indicate that a two-point theory may not be adequate, or too complicated, to provide such stability limits. Just as the importance of capturing coherent structures led to the development of large-eddy simulation approaches in single-phase turbulent flow, the importance of capturing scale-dependent structure in particle-laden suspensions has prompted the development of spatial filtering approaches leading to the VFEL method.",

The interaction of fluid with particles generates stress at the particle surface which manifests as a hydrodynamic force that accelerates the particle center of mass. Furthermore, particles can organize in structures spanning ten to hundred particle diameters due to interaction with the flow and form clusters. Joint two-point statistical representation of particles and fluid is needed to capture these interactions, but the multiscale nature of these interactions poses unique challenges. Considerable progress has been made in singlepoint statistical theory and consistent theories have been developed using SPP and RF approaches, but single-point theories in both approaches are incapable of representing fluctuations in particle number or volume. In this work it is also shown how volume-averaging in the RF approach differs from ensemble-averaging by a stochastic fluctuation term that contains important information about second-order fluctuations in particle number and volume, which is absent in first-order ensemble-averaged quantities such as the ensemble-averaged particle number density and volume fraction. This leads naturally to the consideration of spatial filtering, which results in smooth fields describing a realization of a particle-laden suspension with the potential to more faithfully capture the emergence of scale-dependent structure from instabilities [98] that develop as a consequence of nonlinear interactions between particle configuration and flow conditions specific to each realization, which are not represented in the ensemble average. There have been attempts to produce single-point theories [89] that represent fluctuations in particle volume fraction starting from a mesoscale description involving smooth fields, but as noted earlier this does not reconcile with the microscale picture derived here. It is desirable that both theoretical approaches and simulation methods-PR-DNS at the microscale, VFEL at the mesoscale, and EE TF or LE/QBMM at the macroscale-reconcile across scales, and are validated by experimental data wherever possible.",

Therefore, problem size is limited by available computational resources. It is not feasible with current computational resources to simulate macroscale particle-laden suspensions in industrial devices using PR-DNS. Even when these limitations are lifted, such simulations may not necessarily be useful, for the simple reason that more detailed information does not automatically translate into more insight that is useful in informing decision-making. A more useful approach, already effectively deployed in single-phase turbulent flow, is to use PR-DNS on problem sizes that are currently accessible through available computational resources, and use that simulation data at the microscale to inform statistical theories that are intended to predict phenomena at the meso and macroscale. There are also similarities to the use of molecular dynamics to inform statistical mechanical theories of atomic and molecular systems.",

We can use PR-DNS of microscale dynamics in statistically homogeneous problems on domains of characteristic size L to develop models for unclosed terms in these statistical theories provided local statistical homogeneity can be assumed. This assumes a separation of scales n L. Periodic boundary conditions are usually imposed on such PR-DNS which corresponds to the approximation of an infinite statistically homogeneous suspension by repeating periodic images. The PR-DNS domain has to be large enough to ensure that all Eulerian two-point correlations in both phases have decayed to zero, which implies that L \u2265 g . An interesting observation by Sun [134] is that the length scale of variation of average fluid phase quantities can be significantly affected by interphase transfer terms. For instance, in a particle-laden suspension with heat transfer, fluid heating/cooling by heat exchange with particles in the entrance region can significantly change the length scale of variation of the mean fluid temperature, and this length scale depends on the solid volume fraction and Reynolds number based on the mean slip velocity between particles and fluid. For slow flow through dense particle suspensions, the length scale of variation of mean fluid temperature can be just a few particle diameters in the entrance region. This implies that local closure models may not always be adequate, and non-local closure models might be needed in some multiphase flow problems.",

In classical statistical mechanics, the canonical and microcanonical ensembles are fixed N ensembles, whereas the grand canonical ensemble is a variable N ensemble [135] . Of course these classical ensembles refer to equilibrium thermodynamic states, whereas PR-DNS of canonical homogeneous problems such as steady flow through a fixed bed of particles established by a constant mean fluid pressure gradient pertain to a non-equilibrium steady state. There are also differences in how different PR-DNS studies initialize a statistically homogeneous particle configuration corresponding to a specified average solid volume fraction. Some researchers have used configurations with a PCF/RDF obtained from the steady solution to a granular gas undergoing elastic collisions at that volume fraction [131] . The suitability of a specific computational approach to PR-DNS also depends on other issues such as accuracy and numerical convergence characteristics. A recent rigorous study of the numerical characteristics of the widely-used immersed boundary method (IBM) by Zhou and Balachandar [136] provides precisely this kind of insight, and similar studies on other methods are needed to assess the suitability of each computational approach and provide guidance to the research community on their effective usage.",

For a statistically homogeneous suspension, ergodicity requires that the residual terms in VFEL in the limit of sufficiently large filter width should equal the ensemble-average from PR-DNS. VFEL simulations that satisfy this requirement can be used to model unclosed terms at the mesoscale. The formulations proposed in the following also provide a theoretical basis to relate VFEL simulation data at the mesoscale to EE TF or LE/QBMM simulation data at the macroscale.

For statistically homogeneous gas-solid suspnesions this quantity is equal to the volume fraction of the solid phase. The quantity C(x 1 , x 2 ) is the probability of finding two points x 1 and x 2 simultaneously in the solid phase ( Torquato and Stell [92] ; Sundaram and Collins [91] ). For statistically homogeneous and isotropic gas-solid suspensions, C is only a function of the magnitude of the separation between the points i.e., C(x 1 , x 2 ) = C(|x 1 \u2212 x 2 |). Two limits of this function are of interest. When the separation between the points is very small, C \u2192 \u03c6 and when the separation becomes very large C \u2192 \u03c6 2 . The inherent statistical variability in the volume fraction of the solid phase can be characterized in terms of the variance of the local volume fraction in a given measurement volume. In order to perform this calculation, the local volume fraction ( Lu and Torquato [94] , Quintanilla and Torquato [149] ) in a measurement volume centered at location x is defined as",
