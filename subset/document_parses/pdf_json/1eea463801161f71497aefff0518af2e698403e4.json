Women scored higher on desired family adaptability, cohesion dissatisfaction and adaptive dissatisfaction than men (P = 0.039, P = 0.036, P = 0.008). FPI scores were higher in men and women who lived in rural (P < 0.001, P < 0.001). Family cohesion and education level was negatively correlated with infertility-related stress in men. Family adaptability and education level was negatively correlated with infertility-related stress in women. Healthcare providers should pay more attention and give more support to infertile couples who lived in rural or with low education level, and provide easier medical accessing for them. Moreover, healthcare providers should value more the family function and family support in intervention of reducing infertility-related stress.",

Another studies reported that IVF failure predicted psychological distress, but psychological stress was not related the IVF failure 12,13 . Most of studies reported that women seem to experience more stress than their partner because of childlessness 10, 14, 15 . And the stress level of infertility couples as associated with psychological distress level of their partner, and stress of both partners was associated with adverse IVF outcome 16 . In traditional beliefs of Chinese, childlessness is unfilial. Culture difference might cause different social pressure and mental stress for Chinese papulation 17 . Although the negative effects of infertility-related stress have been reported in the literature, its influencing factors of Chinese population is necessary to investigate 7,15,18 . In China, personal interdependence was emphasized and most people tend to give priority to the needs of family members over their own 19 . Therefore, there might be associations between infertility-related stress and family function. Previous studies showed the age, gender, employment status, economic situation and education level were associated with mental health of infertile couples 17,20,21 , so in order to explore the determinants of infertility-related stress in infertile couples, the sociodemographic characteristics were recorded and taken as independent variables.",

            "text": "Fertility Problem Inventory (FPI). Fertility Problem Inventory (FPI) was developed by Newton et al. in 1999 30 . The FPI is a 46-item self-rating scale assessing level of infertility-related stress. All items are scored using a 6-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (I do not agree) to 6 (I totally agree). Global stress is calculated by summing all five subscale scores, and item 1, 4, 7, 9, 12, 15, 18, 20, 23, 25, 28, 31, 33, 35, 38, 41, 44, 46 are reverse scoring. The minimum score is 46, and the maximum score is 276. Higher scores indicate higher infertility-related stress. It has been translated into several languages and has been widely used in a range of clinical settings. This questionnaire included 5 dimensions: social concerns (10 items), relationship concerns (10 items), need for parenthood (10 items), rejection of childfree lifestyle (8 items) and sexual concerns (8 items). The test-retest reliability of the FPI was 0.83 (female), 0.84 (male), and the Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient was 0.77-0.93. M-FPI (Mandarin version of FPI) was reliable and valid for Chinese infertile couples, and the Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient was 0.81 31 . In our pilot study, 30 female Chinese infertility couples were pre-surveyed by FPI, the Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient was 0.927. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted, the standardized factor loading values ranged from 0.416 to 0.722. Satisfied convergent validity and discriminant validity were confirmed in previous study 31 . M-FPI was verified as a reliable and valid instrument and can be used effectively with infertile Chinese couples. 32 . All items are scored using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 1 (almost never) to 5 (almost always). Total score of Family cohesion = 36 + Item1 + Item 5 + Ite m7 + Ite m11 + It em13 + I tem15 + Item17 + Item21 + Item23 + Item2 5 + Item 27 + It em30 \u2212 Item3 \u2212 Item9 \u2212 Item19 \u2212 Item29. Total sco re of family a dap tab ility = 12 + Item2 + Item4 + Item6 + Item8 + Item10 + Item12 + Item14 + Item16 + Item18 + Item20 + Item22 + Item26 \u2212 Item24 \u2212 Item28. Higher scores indicate higher family adaptability and cohesion. Each participant needed to answer FACES II-CV twice, one time for actual feeling and another time for desired ideal of family situation. The scores difference of two times indicated dissatisfaction with family cohesion and adaptability. The greater the difference, the greater the degree of dissatisfaction. The test-retest reliability was 0.84 and 0.54, Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient was 0.944 33 . In this study, 30 female infertility patients were pre-surveyed by FACES II-CV, the Cronbach's \u03b1 coefficient was 0.901. Confirmatory factor analysis was conducted, the standardized factor loading values ranged from 0.451 to 0.726. Satisfied convergent validity and discriminant validity were confirmed in previous study 34 . FACES II-CV was verified as a reliable and valid instrument and can be appropriate for use in China. T-tests were performed to evaluate the mean differences between men and women regarding their infertilityrelated stress. T-test, ANOVA and multiple comparisons (LSD) were conducted to compare the FPI scores of different demographic characteristics subgroups. Pearson correlation was conducted to explore the correlation between infertility-related stress and family cohesion, family adaptability. Predictor variables (P \u2264 0.1) were entered into the Stepwise linear regression. Stepwise multivariate linear regression was used to explore the influence factors of infertility-related stress. In all analyses, a P value of < 0.05 indicated statistical significance.",

This indicated that women had more negative experiences with infertility than men in most of the domains. This was consistent with previous studies conducted worldwide. The result of Ying et al. indicated that women had more negative experiences in the domains of physical stressors, existential stressors, and emotional stressors than men of infertile couples 35 . The research of Cserepes et al. showed that infertility-related global stress, infertility-related social concerns had more intensive effect on women than on men 15 . The fact that women of infertile couples are more stressful than men may be caused by their gender roles and sex-role identification 18, 36 . Traditionally, motherhood has a more convergent correlation with feminine roles than fatherhood has with masculinity 15 . Compared Table 7 . Pearson correlation analysis between infertility-related stress and family cohesion, family adaptability. Significant values are given in bold. www.nature.com/scientificreports/ to the research of Peterson et al. focusing on Caucasian population, the infertility-related stress level of Chinese couples was higher than Caucasian 37 . Moreover, the infertility-related stress level of Hungarian couples was reported lower than Chinese couples 15 . We inferred that might be due to the traditional beliefs and culture difference. In traditional beliefs of Chinese, childlessness is unfilial, which might cause higher social pressure and mental stress for Chinese papulation 17 . Previous study showed that partner support was in favor of coping with infertility-related distress 35 . Therefore, future study may focus on enhancing a sense of partnership and partner support among infertile couples to help them to cope with infertility-related stress. Culture difference should be considered in psychological support for infertile couples. Family adaptability is the extent flexibility of a family when problems or changes occur. Family cohesion is the degree to which family members experience an emotional bond between each other 22 . In this study, the scores of desired adaptability and adaptive dissatisfaction of women were higher than men of infertile couples, which indicated that women of infertile couples need more communication with their partners or other family members, and hope every members in their family could participate in the decision-making. Moreover, women were found higher cohesion dissatisfaction than men of infertile couples, which indicated that women were less satisfied with the degree of emotional connection between their partners. The reason might be the women's emotional richness and higher social pressure 38 . Compared to the Chinese norm, infertile couples had higher score of actual and desired family cohesion, but lower score of actual and desired family adaptability, which was similar to previous study 27, 28 . We inferred that might be the infertile couples developed tight emotional bond when they received treatment. But the long treatment cycle and financial burden might reduce the family adaptability. Therefore, healthcare providers should encourage men of infertile couples to communicate with their partners and help the infertile couples to develop an emotional bond. Future research could develop tailored intervention to help infertile couples to improve family adaptability.",

The infertile couples who lived in rural had higher FPI scores than those in urban (P < 0.001). This implied that infertile couples who lived in rural had more negative experiences and infertility-related stress than those who lived in urban. This is similar with previous studies, which reported that urban older adults had relatively higher cognitive ability and better psychological health than their rural counterparts in China 39, 40 . As reported, shortages of health providers in rural areas and geographic isolation make accessing for mental healthcare more difficult for rural populations 41 . Therefore, we inferred that infertile couples who lived in rural with greater infertility-related stress because of insufficient information and medical resource. In addition, people live in rural areas may have more traditional concepts about infertility, which may increase their infertility-related stress. China is a developing country, there are huge gaps in terms of economy, social security and health services between urban and rural areas 39, 40 . Healthcare providers should pay more attention and support infertile couples who lived in rural, and help them to face the illness and reduce the infertility-related stress.",

The FPI scores of men with under college education were higher than those with college or above, the FPI scores of women with high school education or below were higher than those with some college education or above. This is consistent with previous study conducted in China 42 . Compared to individuals with higher education level, those educated below high school graduation had higher risk of mental disorders [43] [44] [45] . We inferred that infertile couples with higher education level may be more likely to acquire knowledge about infertility, or have a better way to seek professional assistance. Therefore, healthcare providers should pay more attention to infertile couples who with lower education level and provide easier accessing to medical resources.",

This was similar to previous study, which reported that family function is linked with stress through health behaviors, and better family function with better mental health 22, 23, 46 . Moreover, better family function was associated with better control of chronic diseases and higher quality of life 47, 48 .
