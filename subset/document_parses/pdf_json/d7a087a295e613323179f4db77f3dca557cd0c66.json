Methods: 14 pwMS with EDSS <4.0 and 13 age-and sex-matched healthy controls completed a 12-week in-person PRT exercise intervention. Outcome measures included: plasma metabolomics analysis, cardiovascular fitness tests, EDSS, timed 25-foot walk (T25FW), six-minute walk test (6MWT), hip strength, and modified fatigue impact scale (MFIS). We identified changes in the metabolome with PRT intervention in both groups using individual metabolite abundance and weighted correlation network defined metabolite module eigenvalues and then examined correlations in changes in metabolite modules with changes in various clinical outcomes. Results: In both groups PRT intervention improved hip strength, distance walked in 6WMT, speed of walking, while fatigue (MFIS) was improved in pwMS. Fatty acid, phospholipid, and sex steroid metabolism were significantly altered by PRT in pwMS but not in controls. Changes in fatigue (MFIS score) were strongly inversely correlated and hip strength was moderately correlated with change in sex steroid metabolite module in pwMS. A similar relationship was noted between change in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate abundance (sex steroid metabolite) and fatigue in pwMS. We also noted an inverse correlation between changes in fatty acid metabolism and cardiovascular fitness in pwMS. Interpretation: PRT-induced metabolic changes may underlie improved clinical parameters in pwMS and may warrant investigation as potential therapeutic targets in future studies.",

This intervention was chosen as we have previously shown hip weakness is a major contributor to walking dysfunction in MS. Details of the exercise intervention have been previously published. 9 For the analysis, compliance with the intervention was defined as a completion of a minimum of 20 sessions over 10\u221214 weeks. The minimum compliance was established based on our prior study showing a significant change in 8 weeks of strength training and given the allowance to miss two sessions / month.

            "text": "We noted significant changes in the metabolome of pwMS primarily involving fatty acid, phospholipid and sex steroid metabolism. We noted similar results utilizing both individual metabolite abundances and metabolite modules obtained using WGCNA. Previous studies of exercise interventions in healthy controls have shown great variability in the changes in the resting metabolome following exercise 17, 19, 29, 30 with some showing minimal change attributed to the presence of effects of a variety of additional variables on the metabolome. A recent study examining effects of exercise in army recruits showed that the resting metabolome was altered with changes in some classes of metabolites that overlapped with our findingsincluding certain lipids and products of fatty acid oxidation. 29 Several changes, we noted in the metabolome of pwMS, are compatible with those seen in prior studies of exercise interventions in other populations. Interestingly, in our cohort, we did not note similar changes in the metabolome of healthy controls following PRT. Most recent studies of exercise modalities used to study perturbations in the metabolome of healthy controls rely on much higher intensity levels and shorter intervals (hours not weeks) of exercise with results showing relatively short decay (24 h) in the changes observed. 31 Our results suggest that pwMS may require a less intense intervention to see beneficial lasting changes in the metabolome than health controls. This could potentially point to a specific effect of the PRT intervention in pwMS or perhaps that the intervention did not represent a significant/sufficient metabolic stressor for the healthy control group. We noted associations between the change in the metabolome with PRT and effects on measures of strength, endurance, and fatigue in pwMS, suggesting the possibility that alterations in the metabolome may be mediating some of the beneficial effects noted on clinical outcomes. Specifically, changes in sex steroid metabolism were correlated with improvement in fatigue and increase in hip strength. This effect appeared to be driven by metabolites like DHEAS-a neurosteroid that has previously been associated with a multitude of beneficial biological effects. 32, 33 Multiple studies have examined the relationship between exercise and levels of sex steroids in healthy controls, especially DHEA and DHEAS, with the majority of studies appearing to demonstrate increased levels with exercise though some studies of resistance exercise showed discordant results between the two metabolites. 34 In a previous study, low DHEAS levels were noted in pwMS compared to controls, especially in fatigued pwMS. 35 Similar relationships have also been noted in other autoimmune diseases like Sjogren's and Lupus. Studies have also examined the benefit of supplementation of DHEA on symptoms in Sjogren's syndrome 36 ; however, similar studies have not been conducted in MS. Side effects associated with DHEA supplementation in trials in other conditions have generally been mild and included hirsutism, acne, and greasy skin. 36, 37 Further studies to assess the effects of interventions such as DHEA supplementation in fatigued pwMS may be warranted based on our observations. Another interesting observation in our study was the inhomogeneity of the response to PRT intervention in pwMS. Using an MDC cut-off we noted that just over half of the participants were classified as responders to PRT based on a change in hip strength. While there was no difference in training intensity or baseline characteristics between the two groups, the responders also showed greater improvements in several other outcomes and in particular, in their reduction in fatigue (MFIS total and physical sub-score). The fact that some metabolic changes (such as sex steroid metabolism) differed between responders and non-responders raises the possibility that metabolic changes may explain the varied responsiveness of pwMS for beneficial effects of exercise on clinical outcomes. DHEA supplementation has been tested as a means to augment the beneficial effects of exercise on a variety of end points. 38, 39 Our results also suggest that further research is required to determine whether supplementation of sex steroids like DHEA may help augment the benefit derived by pwMS through an exercise intervention.",

We also enrolled a fairly homogenous cohort of participants with low disability levels to allow for unrestricted participation in the exercise program. Another strength of the study was that we utilized quantitative outcome measures to assess exercise responsiveness and fitness (i.e., dynamometry, estimated VO 2 max) to assess associations with changes in the metabolome. These measures are less subjective compared to typical rating scales (manual muscle testing, self-reported activity levels) and require minimal equipment and training to quantify clinical outcomes making the results of exercise intervention studies more clinically applicable.",

The small sample size may also increase the risk of identifying false-positive associations between the various outcomes. An additional limitation that may reduce the generalizability of the findings is that we selected participants with RRMS and low levels of disability to allow for optimal participation in the exercise intervention.",
