            "text": "Recently SARS-CoV-2 Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant was identified in South Africa with numerous mutations in spike protein, and numerous community infections have been reported and raised grave concern around the world. Some studies found that the neutralization effects of several licensed vaccines against Omicron were dramatically reduced, which significantly affected antibody mediated protection, especially for individuals whose immunization were completed after extended period. In this regard, we studied the persistence and neutralization activity toward mutant strains in animal serum immunized with PIKA-adjuvanted recombinant SARS-CoV-2 spike protein subunit vaccine (YS-SC2-010). Here we are reporting that animal serum collected at 596 days after immunization with YS-SC2-010 still retains high and persistent neutralizing activity against all the Variant of Concern (VOC) variants, including Omicron variant. Although it is a blessed event to achieve 20 months long neutralization against Omicron variant after immunization with YS-SC2-010, it was also founded that the neutralization effect of immune serum on Omicron decreased by 6.29 folds as compared to D614G, more significantly when compared with other mutant strains.",

            "text": "On November 9, 2021, SARS CoV-2 variant Omicron was first reported in South Africa composed of numerous mutations at the spike protein unit, which has become the main antigen target for vaccine design 1 . Therefore, the emergence of Omicron has aroused a new round of concerns about the effectiveness of existing vaccine and the risk of reinfection. Compared with the wild-type strain, S protein of Omicron has 30 nonsynonymous substitutions, three small deletions and one insertion. Among them, 15 mutations are located in the receptor binding domain (RBD), which is the main target of neutralizing antibodies 2 . Several S protein mutations observed in Omicron have also appeared in previously mutated strains, such as alpha, beta, gamma, delta, kappa, zeta, lambda and mu, which may lead to higher transmissibility and immune escape 3, 4 . Since there are multiple mutation sites in Omicron S protein, which may produce aggregate impact on reducing the efficacy of current vaccines, it is urgent to investigate the neutralization effect of the vaccine on Omicron to judge whether it can prevent Omicron infection. Some studies found that the neutralization effects of vaccines on Omicron were seriously reduced, which significantly affected antibody mediated neutralization, especially for individuals immunized for a long time [5] [6] [7] .",

Our studies showed that all serum samples were able to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses including the spike protein of the wild-type strain, and several circulating variants, To test the potential neutralizing response against different variants induced by YS-SC2-010, sera from the rabbits vaccinated with YS-SC2-010 were obtained on certain days after prime immunization. We assayed the neutralization activity against above five SARS-CoV-2 pseudotyped viruses. The mean neutralization titer (ED50) of Alpha, Beta and Gamma is reduced about 1.77, 3.18, and 1.84-fold respectively from the baseline reference strain D614G (Fig. A-C) , while the neutralization for Delta variants is higher than the reference strain D614G (Fig. D) . As for Omicron, which is the most concerned new strain all over the world, the ED50 was 329.7, which represented about 6.29-fold reduction of neutralization compared to the reference strain D614G (ED50=2074) (Fig. 1E ).",
