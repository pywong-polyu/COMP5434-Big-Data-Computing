The sociodemographic section included questions about general details of respondents, such as age, gender, professional status, years of experience, marital status, living arrangements, and sources of knowledge. The knowledge section consisted of 16 items that aimed at assessing the knowledge about incubation period, transmission, fatality rate, symptoms, risk factors, and treatment of COVID-19. In the attitude section, 6 items were used to assess respondents' perception towards the spread, severity, and prevention of COVID-19.

Around 70% of respondents followed hand hygiene and washed their hands after patient contact. This is in contrast with another research conducted during the MERS outbreak that found handwashing to be the most popular practice and only half of the respondents stated that they wear masks (12) . Unfortunately, more than 40% of our respondents stated that they do not use gloves during patient interaction, which is possible because of lack of habit among HCWs, as it is not a common practice in Pakistan to wear gloves during clinics. Furthermore, the lack of resources, especially in government/public sector hospitals, may also be a barrier towards following all preventative measures.",

To support this argument, about 42.1% of respondents of our survey feared transmitting the disease to their family members and friends. Few risk factors to increase the stress are lower levels of specialized training, preparedness, and job experience, which can be associated with the fact that such pandemic occurs once in a lifetime and managing such a situation becomes difficult considering its rarity (25) . Finally, young individuals, who represent half of the population of the country, are also susceptible to this virus due to the exposure yielded while managing the daily outdoor activities like grocery shopping, etc. No association was, however, found between marital status and stress levels.",

This may be done by providing them with adequate personal protective equipment (such as masks, shields, proper attire, etc.). Following this will not only protect HCWs from the disease but as suggested by a study, assurance of personal safety is one of the major factors that will help alleviate stress levels among health care workers (16) .

Gaining authentic information is also immensely important as during the ongoing pandemic, the spread of misinformation may lead to xenophobia (2) . On an individual level, using stringent protective measures universally for all patients, using disposable scrubs at work, and minimizing outside exposure in the form of semi-quarantine are few of the measures that have shown to help staff cope with these tough times (16) .",

We also found high levels of stress among HCWs, and main stressors were found to be personal safety, family safety, and lack of information regarding upcoming advances in the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, the government should take measures to mitigate these stress levels to produce a strong front line force to combat COVID-19. Our study suggests that better training programs and promotion of preventative measures, along with providing adequate PPE and ensuring life safety of HCWs, will most likely help in releasing this stress among them, leading to better attitude and practice.",
