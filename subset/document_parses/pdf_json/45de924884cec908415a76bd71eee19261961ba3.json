Future engineers will require such skills as creative thinking, ability to make informed, effective decisions, as well as social responsibility and eco-thinking. The research was carried out on the tools used to organize online learning during the COVID-19 pandemic in several universities. It gave a possibility to compare the effectiveness of using different virtual environments to organize the training of different profiles' engineers, as well as to analyze the educational content and its difference from that used in traditional classroom teaching. To make a correct assessment, evaluation criteria were identified, which can be formalized, and also motivational characteristics were classified, which can be influenced on the quality improvement. For a case study, different student's groups were selected to compare them involvement in the process with traditional and online training forms as well as their performance. Additionally, was done an analysis how a training form impacts on their projects quality.",

One of these challenges is pandemics, similar to COVID-19, leading to a collapse in many activities areas and the economic systems' imbalance. In such conditions, the educational system gets increased requirements associated with the need to specialists training by various economy sectors, who could work in critical situations. The educational system should maintain ability to overcome inertia, in the same time it must be enough flexible both from the viewpoint of educational methods and technologies and from the process control viewpoint. In recent years, the engineering education system has been improved through the use of new opportunities e-learning software [1] . In the same time, the growing complexity of engineering and technology requires considerable efforts from students during both training and subsequent professional activities. Future engineers be able to make informed effective decisions, should be have creative thinking and ecothinking and social responsibility. Currently, the emergence of new tools and techniques for engineering education is associated with processes in all spheres of public life and activities. These are such trends as Industry 4.0, Smart City, smart transport and logistics, industry digitalization, digital twins, etc. Smart education, virtual and augmented reality technologies allow improving the educational environment, increasing the students' motivation and their competitiveness, as they prepare them for life in the digital age.",

            "text": "University professors are often committed to traditional lecturing and laboratory teaching methods, which is why many of them experience stress under unusual external circumstances. To avoid stress, it is necessary to pre-test various resources, combining traditional and online learning. A similar stress is experienced by students who have in ordinary conditions a motivating factor by the conscious choice of the form and method of receiving education, but in critical situations there is no such choice and the student is faced with a dilemma: either to submit to the conditions accepted due to external circumstances, or to refuse training. Based on the above-mentioned facts, the following challenges were formulated: (1) What changes in the management system of universities, departments as well as educational processes should be implemented in order to increase efficiency during critical situations? (2) What changes in educational contents are necessary to ensure the necessary quality of education as well as involvement and motivation of students? (3) How will it be possible to use the gained experience after the crisis? In the authors' opinion, the most effective tool for the reactive management of learning process, as a complex system, is feedback. Due to the duration of learning process, the educational system is very inert. That is why the effective feedback is a tool to overcome this inertia. The way to implement feedback between teachers and students is a key factor determined the quality of the educational process and student involvement. To give a teaching staff the real possibility to monitor and evaluate the quality of education, it is necessary to identify objective criteria for such evaluation in the context how motivational features are differentiated. In addition, in such way an academic teacher will be able to assess the effectiveness how a particular method influences on the motivational criterion. Such a system, which were developed using formalized criteria, will be more objective and reveal problems for an individual student or group of students, as well as within the framework of a training course or a separate section of a course unit.",

It is recommended to duplicate theoretical materials from lectures, uploading them to Moodle, where the student can study the theory while solving examples, then to check the acquired knowledge with the help of tests uploaded to the system. Thus, students could prepare for the final exam. The final grade is made up of two parts: the first one is the sum of the points obtained when studying the course and passing the control tests, the second part is the grade for the exam. The article [4] presents a learning model, which uses the YouTube video repository for engineering courses. Some results show students' preference for this model over the more traditional learning models, which use a live video. The results can be applied to develop hybrid models for engineering courses, which can have a positive impact on student satisfaction and, in general, on the course where the model is used. The article [5] describes an experimental study of the Online Flipped Classroom Learning Model (OFCLM) in relation to open and distance learning for adults in a training center. The main results showed that students liked the flexibility and convenience of the proposed model. Smart Classroom is defined as a concept, which needs to adapt to synchronous and asynchronous learning using artificial intelligence technology, that teachers and students can approach different learning styles, engage interactively, and share content. The study [6] provides a system of \"intelligent classes\", which covers the process of distance learning within the framework of the Smart Learning System (SLS) as well as learning in a classroom using the Smart Learning Environment (STE). The proposed Smart Classroom allows to facilitate both classroom learning and distance learning processes.",

Students at a distance often experience social exclusion and lack of communication with their peers. A survey was conducted to better understand the nature of the relationships established between distance students and peers.

This hybrid teaching method combines a massive open online course (MOOC) with students' personal work. As a new form of distance learning, the Blended Synchronous Learning Environment (BSLE) is a new learning environment that allows students to participate in the learning process synchronously. In China, BSLE has a more unique practical meaning -the Blended Synchronous Classroom (BSC) -to solve the problem of educational equilibrium. The purpose of the study [18] is to compare and analyze the preliminary results of the BSC project, then investigate the key problems of the BSC and give appropriate countermeasures in combination with specific situations to lay the foundation for the future development of BSC and increase its reliability. In recent years, the successful integration of virtual reality in the context of distance learning has led to the development of various structures related to virtual learning approaches, which are used to improve interaction with students and improve their overall learning experience. The purpose of the study [19] is a thorough study and a deep understanding of the impact that embodied pedagogical agents have on the students' learning experience, as well as on their academic performance. In a future work, the authors of the article plan to create agents that resemble well-known scientists (for example, Albert Einstein), and evaluate how the appearance of agents affects the learning experience of students.",

Traditionally, the learning process was carried out by transferring educational content in the classroom: in the lectures, laboratory and practical exercises. With the advent of computers and the information technology's development, new types of educational content have appeared, as well as new teaching methods. To expand the possibilities in implementing the concept of \"life-long learning\", technologies for the distance education implementation have appeared. As can be seen from the above review, these technologies currently provide the opportunity to receive a quality education, although they have problems. The modern university implements both traditional and distance learning. However, it should be borne in mind that, firstly, these are two completely autonomous processes with their own management systems, and secondly, the participants in the process (administrators, teachers and students) consciously chose one form or another and, therefore, are mentally prepared to the features of the learning implementation.",

As shown in [22] , Covid-19 forced Indian universities, as in the world rest, to switch to online classes, suspending physical classes. Online training is conducted both using recorded classes, including MOOC, and through online classes conducted in the sessions form with zoom or webinars. To do this, professors need high-speed Internet and platforms to provide education or a learning management system, as well as a stable IT infrastructure and professors who are ready to teach online. High-speed Internet and computers or mobile phones are also needed by students to attend or review previously recorded classes. In India, diverse online education platforms are supported by the Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD), the National Council for Educational Research and Training (NCERT), and the Department of Technical Education. There are also initiatives such as SWAYAM (online courses for teachers), e-PG Pathshala (electronic content) and NEAT (enhancing employability). Other online platforms are aimed at improving communication with institutions and access to content. They are used for training materials and classes, as well as for working with online modules.

However, despite the availability of technology, there is a problem of access, since not every student has a fast Internet and a computer. A survey conducted by an IIT teacher showed that 9.3% of its 2789 students were unable to download materials sent by the institute or study online.

Another study conducted by LocalCircles among 25,000 respondents found that only 57% of students at home had the necessary equipmenta computer, router, and printerto attend online classes. Students note difficulties in obtaining materials due to lack of internet-traffic and connection problems, as well as the stress caused by the need to be in touch all the time and watch the whole day to a computer or phone screen.

In order to increase the educational system sustainability and its readiness to work under stress, it is necessary to identify the risks causes, ways to its minimize and measures to manage the system in a risk situation. Since the transition to distance learning was carried out in accordance with the order of the Ministry of Russia Education and Science, the Ministry, together with the Institute for Social Analysis and Forecasting of the Russian Academy of National Economy and Public Administration at the end of the academic year, conducted a mass survey of the universities' teaching staff on the development of the online environment in the context of coronavirus infection. It summarizes the attitude of teachers to distance education in the context of a sharp change in their professional activities and the organization of their personal lives. 33987 teachers, or about 15% of the total of the teaching staff, were taken part in the survey. The results of the study showed that teachers are organizationally ready for the transition to distance learning formats, but psychologically they do not accept such a sharp break with traditional full-time education. A skeptical attitude to what is happening is due to both the peculiarities of the disciplines taught (for example, technical and experimental), and conservative views on the nature of teaching. Although teachers formally accept the transition to distance education, they have an internal, latent rejection of it in all areas of training, regardless of gender, age, social and professional status. The survey recorded two positive social characteristics of the professional community of university teachers: the adoption of a state policy on countering coronavirus infection and the availability of skills and abilities to work in an online environment. At the same time, the breakdown of the usual life way, the destruction of the existing day race-order, in which work and rest are distributed not only in time, but also in space, led to stress and, as a result, rejection of distance education: 66% of teachers indicate that they don't like working at home; 34% of teachers have no place at home for comfortable teaching; 85.7% of teachers have less free time, they have an idea of an increase in the workload; 87.8% believe that it is better to conduct their classes in fulltime format. The main request of teachers comes down to three components: material (providing with computer equipment and software); communicative (an environment for communication, necessary and sufficient to support distance learning, inclusion in the team and maintaining a high level of learning); organizational (reducing bureaucratic pressure and providing more freedom in the choice of teaching means and methods).",

In general, the results of the survey in Russia coincide with the opinion of the teachers in our university (Fig. 1) . In our research, we studied the following issues: (1) What virtual environments have shown the greatest efficiency in terms of process control, education quality, student involvement, increasing their motivation; (2) How the transition to online learning has affected the quality of educational content, its structure, the employment of teachers and students, class attendance; (3) What resources should be developed to control learning quality and the process organization. The university implements both the traditional form of education and the distance learning. For these purposes, a special \"virtual audience\" has been created. Each teacher can access to it and use this resource as an addition to traditional teaching. At the beginning of the transition to online mode, courses were held for teachers on the use of this resource. But when the mass connection began, it turned out that the technical capabilities of mass simultaneous use of this resource are clearly not enough since access is through the university's website.
