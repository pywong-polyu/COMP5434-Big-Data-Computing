            "text": "Patients with African ancestry sustain a significantly higher risk of non-Mendelian focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) as well as end stage kidney disease (ESKD) (reviewed in literature (1)). Seminal work identified the risk genotypes of Apolipoprotein L1 (APOL1) when present as two copies of either or both G1 and G2 alleles, (2) explained the increased risk of FSGS and ESRD observed in African Americans (AAs). (3, 4) Mechanistic data have since focused on the role of APOL1 risk alleles in kidney epithelial cells including gain-of-function roles in FSGS (5) and pre-eclampsia, (6) and loss-of-function role in parietal cell biology. (7) In renal transplantation, two copies of the APOL1 risk alleles when present in donor have associated with death-censored allograft loss (DCAL). (8) (9) (10) While donor African ancestry is incorporated into the kidney donor risk index, (11) giving weight to donors carrying two copies of APOL1 risk allele vs. all others, improved the prediction of DCAL. (12) Few mechanistic data suggest the development of FSGS in APOL1 risk genotype-carrying allografts. (13, 14) On the other hand, a single retrospective study in kidney transplant recipients reported that recipient carriage of APOL1 risk alleles was not associated with DCAL. (15) These data have since led to emphasis on the role of APOL1 expression in renal cells and outcomes. The role of APOL1 risk alleles in nonrenal tissues including immune cells has not been specifically examined. A universal mechanism linking APOL1 risk alleles to allograft outcomes has not yet emerged from literature and a nationwide prospective study is currently underway. (16) Previous studies by several groups show associations among self-declared AA ethnicity and increased rejection episodes and/or DCAL. (17) (18) (19) (20) (21) We recently reported that recipient African ancestry expressed as a quantitative variable (defined as R-pAFR) was associated with DCAL in a prospective renal transplant cohort. (22) While current concepts implicate altered tacrolimus metabolism, (18) specific induction and/or maintenance therapy, (19) and socioeconomic factors to account for these observations, these associations do not fully explain the worse outcomes in recipients with African ancestry.",

We report the unexpected association of R-nAPOL1 with DCAL in additive models, implying a role for even one APOL1 risk allele (either G1 or G2) in recipients, distinct from the previously reported association of two risk alleles in the donor with increased DCAL. This association was identified in all recipients as well as in AA and Hispanic (AA/H) recipients. We then identified a novel association of R-nAPOL1 with T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR), independent of recipient AA ethnicity, and validated these results externally. Finally, additional analyses implicate an unanticipated role for APOL1 risk alleles on immune activation, specifically in activated CD4 + /CD8 + T cells and CD56 dim nature killer (NK) cells, providing a potential mechanism to account for the observed associations.",

We employed a sub-cohort of 385 donor-recipient (D-R) pairs with genome-wide genotype data from GOCAR for discovery, (22) and a sub-cohort of 122 D-R pairs with genome-wide genotype data from CTOT as a validation set (see Materials and Methods; Figures S1 and S2). Demographic and clinicopathologic characteristics of GOCAR and CTOT cohorts, stratified by R-nAPOL1, are in Table 1 and published elsewhere. (22, 23) Clinical characteristics between the two cohorts are comparable (Table S1 ), although CTOT cohort contained a higher proportion of AA/H recipients and deceased donors. The GOCAR cohort had longer follow-up using UNOS and ANZDATA databases (mean follow-up 4.6 years) and thus more DCAL and TCMR events, (22) while CTOT collected information up to 5-years (mean follow-up 3.7 years). For each D-R pair from both cohorts, we used genome-wide genotype data excluding the MHC region (22) to estimate pAFR and infer genetic ancestry (Table S2) . As expected, APOL1 genotyping showed that G1/G2 risk alleles are only detected in genetic AAs or Hispanics (i.e., AA/H) among D-Rs in both cohorts (see Methods; Tables S3 and S4). We observed a higher frequency of depletional induction agents in R-nAPOL1 subjects from both cohorts without differences in the number of D-R HLA mismatches between recipients carrying APOL1 risk alleles and non-carriers (Table 1) .",

We investigated the association of R-nAPOL1 with DCAL for all recipients and in the AA/H strata in the GOCAR (discovery) and CTOT (validation) cohorts. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis ( Figure 1 ) stratified by the number of APOL1 risk alleles (0, 1, or 2) showed clear differentiation among groups, with the number of risk alleles correlating directly with higher risk of DCAL in both cohorts (GOCAR cohort: log-rank p-value < 0.0001; CTOT cohort: log-rank p-value = 0.0075). The finding supports an additive effect of the APOL1 risk alleles in recipients on graft survival, i.e. each copy of the risk alleles increases the risk of graft loss, distinct from prior data.(3) We next adjusted for covariates previously shown to be associated with DCAL, (22) including genetic ancestry, induction therapy, and donor type, using a multivariable Cox regression analysis ( Table   2 ). This analysis revealed that in GOCAR, R-nAPOL1 remained associated with DCAL in an additive manner (HR = 2.14 per copy of risk alleles; p-value = 0.006), independent of recipients' genetic ancestry. Analysis of the CTOT cohort validated the results (Table   S5 ). When we performed a meta-analysis including both cohorts (Figure 2 ), we observed the hazard ratio of each additional risk allele was 2.27 (95% CI: 1.41 ~ 3.63; p-value = 0.0007). When we performed sensitivity analysis within the strata of AA/H recipients, we observed a similar pattern of significantly separated Kaplan-Meier survival curves for the three R-nAPOL1 groups ( Figure S3A ) as well as a significant association between R-nAPOL1 and DCAL with similar effect size (Table 2) in GOCAR. Within the AA/H strata of CTOT, we found that the pattern of differentiated survival curves ( Figure S3B ) and the positive association of R-nAPOL1 with DCAL (Table S5 ) remained, albeit with diminished significance level due to limited sample size. To account for the effect on allograft survival of donor APOL1 risk genotype, where high-risk genotype in donors is defined as 2 copies of G1/G2 alleles and low-risk genotype as 0 or 1 copy of G1/G2 allele, we performed additional sensitivity analyses stratified by donor APOL1 risk genotype in both the cohorts. The multivariable Cox regression analyses were performed on the stratum of donors carrying the low-risk genotype, as the sample sizes for the high-risk group in both cohorts are limited. The results from stratified analyses remain similar as in the main analysis: the R-nAPOL1 was associated with DCAL, independent of donor APOL1 risk genotype, for all recipients and for AA/H recipients (Tables S6 and S7 ). Together, these data demonstrate that R-nAPOL1 associates with DCAL in an additive manner in both cohorts.",

The study designs captured clinical rejection episodes up to 2 years in both cohorts, as well as subclinical rejections at 3, 12, and 24 months (GOCAR), and at 6 months (CTOT). (23) (24) (25) In GOCAR, 126 recipients (32.7%) had at least one episode of subclinical or clinical TCMR (with Banff borderline or greater) identified among 3 surveillance biopsies, (22, 25) while in CTOT, 15 recipients (12.3%) had at least one TCMR episode including the 6-month surveillance biopsy.(23) R-nAPOL1 significantly associated with various TCMR outcomes in multivariable logistic regression models, independent of donor APOL1 risk genotype, with progressively increasing odds ratios present with more severe TCMR phenotypes (Table 3) . For sensitivity analyses in the subset of AA/H recipients, analyses showed that the association of R-nAPOL1 with different TCMR outcomes remained, with similar increasing odds ratio with increased severity of TCMR phenotypes. In the CTOT cohort, by logistic regression, we observed that the association of R-nAPOL1 with TCMR was significant for the whole cohort and the AA/H subset in univariate analysis, while the direction and magnitude of the association remained with reduced significance in multivariable analysis (Table S8) .

            "text": "Since we found a correlation between R-pAFR and R-nAPOL1, we tested for associations between R-pAFR and transplant outcomes independent of R-nAPOL1, noting that we previously reported that R-pAFR did not associate with Banff inflammation subscores or TCMR up to 2 years post-transplant. (22) This previous work also showed that no other Banff component scores in biopsies obtained within 2 years associated with R-pAFR in GOCAR. Herein, using GOCAR and CTOT cohorts, we used linear mixed models incorporating all available longitudinal creatinine data (to account for intraindividual variability) to determine the association between R-pAFR and creatinine levels (or estimated GFR) as a measure of kidney function. This analysis revealed that in GOCAR, R-pAFR significantly associated with serum creatinine levels from 3 to 24 months after transplant, independent of R-nAPOL1, post-transplant recipient BMI (to account for creatinine generation), donor APOL1 risk genotype, and donor pAFR (to account for AA-to-AA transplants) (Table 4; Figure S4 ). For example, as shown in Table   4 , a recipient with 100% of African ancestry has on average 0.75 mg/dL higher serum creatinine than a recipient with 0% of African ancestry, or equivalently, every 10% increment of African ancestry in recipient would lead to a 0.075 mg/dL increment in creatinine level. We confirmed this association in CTOT with creatinine levels between 3 and 12 months after transplant (Table 4; Figure S4 ). Estimated GFR by modified MDRD or CKD-EPI equations (26) tended to inversely correlate with R-pAFR in mixed models but insignificantly (p-value = 0.06; not shown). These data relayed distinct posttransplant phenotypic associations of recipient African ancestry and recipient APOL1 risk allele status, in our study cohorts. All rights reserved.

This was especially relevant since 90.3% (GOCAR) and 82.5% (CTOT) of donors had G0/G0 genotype, while 11.2% (GOCAR) and 21.7% (CTOT) of recipients had either one or two copies of G1 and/or G2 alleles (Table S3 ), increasing the likelihood of an APOL1 D-R mismatch among recipients with APOL1 risk alleles. We defined a SNP-based mismatch score to quantify the overall mismatch between any given D-R pair at the APOL1 locus, and to reflect the overall effect of the introduction of any new APOL1 variants from the donor kidney into the recipient (see Methods). Multivariable Cox models showed that APOL1 SNP-based mismatch score had no significant effect on DCAL (Table S9) , and conditional on the APOL1 SNP-based mismatch score, the R-nAPOL1 remained associated with DCAL for all the recipients and the AA/H recipients in both cohorts (Table S9 ). This suggests an intrinsic effect of APOL1 risk alleles in recipients on DCAL independent of APOL1 D-R \"mismatches\".",

A single center retrospective study of 119 African American renal recipients did not find the association of recipient APOL1 risk allele with DCAL.(15) However, donor APOL1 genotypes were unknown here. Further, this study reported an unusually high DCAL rate of 25% at 5 years (vs. 5% and 11% for living-and deceased-donor kidneys in recent SRTR data), which likely contributed to inability to identify significant impact of R-nAPOL1 in this dataset. (17) An issue with APOL1 association studies in transplantation is the exclusive association of G1/G2 alleles with African ancestry, a potential confounder for transplant outcomes. (30) In our data we addressed this issue in adjusted models using genetic ancestry (which was previously reported as more accurate than self-reported ancestry by our group (22) and others (31)) or R-pAFR (a quantitative measurement of ancestry), inferred from genome-wide genotype data, as well as in the strata of AA/H recipients, strengthening our findings of the association of APOL1 risk alleles with DCAL. We then identified a novel association of R-pAFR (and not R-nAPOL1) with serum creatinine levels within 2 years post transplantation. Furthermore, adjustment for longitudinal creatinine levels as a time-varying covariate in the survival models did not significantly attenuate the association of R-nAPOL1 with DCAL suggesting creatinine levels were not a mediator for the association of R-nAPOL1 with DCAL (not shown). Since transplant recipients are dependent on the allograft for creatinine excretion, the novel association between R-pAFR and post-transplant creatinine levels, may reflect increased generation of creatinine in recipients with African ancestry. Hence, our data reflective of genetically determined changes in creatinine levels are also timely to the ongoing discussion of the role of ancestry adjustment in estimated GFR equations, (32) and contributory to the use of genetic ancestry for these purposes.

Our data raise new avenues for the investigation of APOL1 in allo-immune responses in renal transplantation --the role of APOL1 gene products in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and cytolytic NK cells (CD56 dim ), the role of wild type vs. variant APOL1 protein/mRNA, and gain-of-function vs. loss-of-function mechanisms --all need to be comprehensively examined. While renal epithelial cell injury mechanisms from APOL1 risk variants have been the subject to intense study,(5, 6, 30) APOL1 homologues were originally identified as TNF\u03b1 responsive genes in endothelial cells. (34, 35) In humans, the APOL1 promoter has binding sequences for STAT2 and interferon responsive transcription factors, and a role for APOL1 as a cellular immune response gene in antiviral immunity has been postulated to explain its association with HIV-associated nephropathy. (36) Collapsing FSGS after viral infection was reported in APOL1 risk allele-carrying allografts, (14) and recently in a recipient with APOL1 risk allele after COVID-19 infection. (37) In lupus nephritis, where APOL1 risk genotypes associate with increased progression of disease, a toxic gain-of-function role for APOL1 variants by disrupting T cell autophagy and interferon signaling has been postulated. (38) Consistently, progressive nephritis was worsened with every copy of risk allele in Brazilian AA/H lupus patients. (39) In this context, our data implicating a role for APOL1 within T cells involved in adaptive immune responses against a donor organ, demonstrate that previous data regarding R-nAPOL1 and allograft outcomes need to be reinterpreted, and its role in infiltrating inflammatory mononuclear cells in native kidney glomerulonephritis investigated.",

Third, the sample size of AA/H donors with African ancestry in both cohorts was limited, leading to few observed APOL1 risk alleles in donors. Larger multi-ethnic cohorts with adequate sample size of APOL1 risk alleles in D-R pairs will help evaluate the interaction of APOL1 risk alleles in donor organs and recipients on long-term transplant outcomes. (16) Last, the results from DEGs and enrichment analysis were only at nominal significance level given the limited sample sizes and the burden of multiple hypothesis testing. Nevertheless, rather than drawing conclusive results, we aimed to find suggestive directions in terms of pathways and cell types where APOL1 risk alleles may have effects on transcriptome and the transplant outcomes. Our findings are a platform to investigate cell-type specific immune functions of APOL1 in novel experimental models such as the human BAC transgenic mouse strains expressing either G0, G1 or G2 genes at physiological levels while remaining responsive to endogenous cytokine stimuli.",

PBMCs or spleen cells obtained from deceased donors were sent to the Mount Sinai core laboratory where they were processed and frozen.

There are missing data in the APOL1 genotype for 2 recipients and 2 donors (see Figures S1 and S2 and Table S3 for details). c : P-value was calculated from ANOVA for continuous variables and from Fisher's exact test for categorical variables unless otherwise specified. d : HLA mismatch score was derived from 2-digit HLA allele typing. Following previous reports for GOCAR, (22, 24, 25) the raw mismatch score (scaling from 0 to 6) was categorized into: 0 (no mismatches), 1 (1-2 mismatches), 2 (3-4 mismatches), and 3 (5-6 mismatches); while for the CTOT cohort, the raw mismatch score (scaling from 0 to 6) was used. In subsequent statistical analyses, this variable was used as a numeric covariate in regression models. The p-value for this variable in the current table was derived from Kruskal-Wallis test. e : Genetic ancestry was inferred from genome-wide genotype data and considered more accurate than self-reported race. (22) f : See materials and methods for detailed description of the data. The \"Asian\" category was excluded due to limited sample size which led to instable model fitting.",

The gene expression data was measured as transcript per million reads (TPM). Genes with mean TPM less than 1 across all samples were excluded from further analysis. Raw TPM expression profiles were log2-transferred by log2(TPM + 1), where a value of 1 was added to account for 0 values in TPM. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) between the group of individuals with one or two copies of APOL risk alleles (n = 5) and the group of individuals without any risk alleles (n = 17) were identified using the functions \"contrasts.fit\" and \"eBayes\" implemented in an R package limma (version 3.38.3).(59)",

Lysates were subjected to immunoblot analysis --APOL1 antibody (ABCAM [ab231523]), Rabbit polyclonal Anti GAPDH antibody (#5174, Cell Signaling). Statistical analysis Descriptive statistics (mean, standard deviation [SD], median, and range) were used to summarize the baseline characteristics of the GOCAR and CTOT cohorts. When comparing the baseline characteristics between groups of recipients carrying different numbers of APOL1 risk alleles, Fisher's exact test was used to calculate p-value for categorical variables, analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables, and Kruskal-Wallis test for ordinal variables. Kaplan-Meier plot was used to visualize and compare the death-censored graft survival curves between groups of recipients carrying different numbers of APOL1 risk alleles and a log-rank test was used to calculate the pvalue. The association of time-to-event outcome (DCAL) with risk factors was evaluated with Cox regression. The association of dichotomous outcomes (different TCMR outcomes) with risk factors was evaluated with logistic regression.
