Studies have shown that hypertension and diabetes can lead to a decrease in organ reserves [8, 9] . This phenomenon suggests that in patients with hypertension and diabetes, organ reserves are reduced, thus reducing the ability to withstand viral attacks and leading to more severe symptoms requiring ICU treatment. In the 416 patients with COVID-19 in this study, we did not observe a greater number of men than women, which is different from the results of a previous study [4] . However, the proportion of males was found to be higher in the ICU group, which was consistent with the reports of MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV infection [6, 10] . The lower female susceptibility to viral infection may be related to protection conferred by the X chromosome and sex hormones, which may play important roles in innate and adaptive immunity [7] . Another possible cause is sympathetic hyperactivity. Damage to norepinephrine reuptake in the elderly population increases the sympathetic signal, especially the cardiac sympathetic signal, causing greater cardiac stimulation [11] . Whether the difference in the neurobiology of sympathetic nerves based on age and sex renders COVID-19 more likely to cause heart damage in elderly patients and patients of a specific sex is unknown. Compared with the non-ICU patients, the ICU patients had more laboratory abnormalities. The most common laboratory abnormalities in this study were a decreased lymphocyte count, a prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated levels of blood urea nitrogen, BNP, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, D-dimer, and IL-6. These abnormalities suggest that SARS-CoV-2 infection may be related to cellular immune deficiency, coagulation activation, and injury to multiple organs. Moreover, PaO 2 and PaO 2 /FiO 2 were significantly lower in the ICU group, suggesting more serious hypoxia in these patients. Activated macrophages can release IL-6 and other cytokines and promote the expression of adhesion molecules. Dysfunctional endothelial cells become adhesive and secrete procoagulant factors [12] . These changes further accelerate the inflammation of blood vessels and enhance the prethrombotic state. The presence of microvascular lesions and microthrombi can also cause patients to be prone to multiple organ failure, further aggravating the state of heart damage and heart failure. Therefore, patients with elevated IL-6 and D-dimer must be monitored closely to prevent micro-embolism.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1540, "end": 1543, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1544, "end": 1546, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 1640, "end": 1643, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1644, "end": 1646, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 2025, "end": 2028, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 2178, "end": 2181, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2182, "end": 2185, "text": "10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 2379, "end": 2382, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2611, "end": 2615, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3601, "end": 3605, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 231, "end": 238, "text": "Table 5", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Regarding myocardial injury markers, TnI and MYO levels were significantly higher in the ICU patients.

Recent research shows that TnI and BNP peaked within 1 week before COVID-19 patients died and indicates that elevated cardiac markers may be a warning sign of a poor prognosis [13] .
