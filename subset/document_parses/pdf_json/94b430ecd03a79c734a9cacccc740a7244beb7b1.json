L protein of four arenaviruses include TCRV, LCMV, GGV and CASV were utilized for searching for translated nucleotide, as transcriptome ShoutGun Assembly (TSA) of translated blast (tBLASTn) on NCBI facility was used for this purpose (McGinnis & Madden 2004) . Then, ExPASy translated tools was used for identification open reading frames (ORFs) of translated protein for TSA species (RNA transcript) (Gasteiger et al. 2003) . Subsequently, the HHpred tools kits that available on https://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/#/tools/hhpred was used for homology detection and structure prediction of the target proteins sequences (S\u00f6ding et al. 2005) . As the result, Bayesian tree were designed by MrBayes version 3.2.6 interface for novel/existence arenaviruses with some other viruses amino acids sequences to evaluation evolution history between the viruses (Ronquist et al. 2011 ) (Hall 2011 Value indicates the numbers of the hits during database searching that expected by chance when two or more sequences were aligned. The more significant E. Value when the parameter are less than 1 or zero, whilst the E. value equal to one is not consider since it means there is one chance for similarity between the hits (Pearson 1995) . As a result, the target transcript RNA sequences (table 1) were used for open reading frames (ORFs) detection and then for protein translation, homology detection and structure prediction with other protein that found online databases. At least, all sequences data including translated protein of TSA species and the sequences of Mammarenaviruses (TCRV and LCMV) and Reptarenaviruses (GGV and CASV) used for multiple sequence alignment (MSA) and finally for designing Bayesian phylogenetic trees. So, tBLASTn confirmed that there are many living species that have some genes homology with L gene of Arenaviridea that could carry and/or infected with arenaviruses that make risk of virus transmission to the human as zoonotic.",
