Residents were invited to participate in the serological survey performed in June and July 2020. Sociodemographic and clinical characterization of the participants as well as the LTCF profile were recorded. Blood samples were collected, processed and serum samples were tested using the rapid One Step COVID-19 immunochromatography test to detect IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2. Among 209 residents, the median of age was 81 years old, 135 (64.6%) were female and 171 (81.8%) self-referred as being white. An overall seroprevalence of 11.5% (95% CI: 7.5% -16.6%) was found. The highest seroprevalences of 100% and 76.9% were observed in LTCFs that had experienced COVID-19 outbreaks. Most residents with positive immunochromatography tests (70.8%) referred previous contact with a confirmed COVID-19 case. Although there was a relatively low seroprevalence of COVID-19 in the total number of elderly people, this population is highly vulnerable and LTCFs are environments at higher risk for COVID-19 dissemination. A well-established test for COVID-19 policies, the adequate characterization of the level of interaction between residents and the healthcare provider team and the level of complexity of care are crucial to monitor and control the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in these institutions.",

In March 2020, the Brazilian Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology and the World Health Organization recommended the suspension of external visits to residents in LTCFs 5 . Therefore, the assessment of SARS CoV-2 seroprevalence is important in the definition of heath care policies in LTCFs.",

The first cases, in both institutions, were confirmed in women residents by RT-PCR. From June 3 rd to 25 th , the local health authority collected nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal secretions to perform the RT-PCR test for COVID-19 in all elderly residents and employees (called \"Universal RT-PCR test\") from the 20 LTCFs located in the city. In this study, 20 institutions were invited and 15 (75%) agreed to participate. Only the residents were invited to participate in the serological survey. The institutions were assessed for the complexity of the care provided based on the degree of dependence of the residents. The degree of dependence and the most frequent fragility observed among residents were used to define the level of care complexity of each LTCF.The functional capacity of the elderly was assessed using the Katz index, which includes actions related to self-care (bathing, personal hygiene, dressing, the ability to eat without help, the ability to move without help for transference and continence). The total score corresponds to the sum of the 'yes' answers in relation to the items related to independence. Residents were considered independent if they reached a score between 5 and 6 points, partially dependent when the result was 3 or 4 points and highly dependent with scores of zero, 1 or 2 points 7 . Frailty was assessed by the Frail Scale, in which residents were classified as robust (0 points), prefrail (1 to 2 points), and frail (3 points) 8 and for Frail Nursing Home (Frail-NH), [robust (0 to 1 point), prefrail (2 to 5 points), and frail (6 or more points)] 9 .

Such vulnerability can be seen in the two LTCFs that had previous COVID-19 outbreaks and had seroprevalence rates above 70% and case fatality rates of 33.3% in their residents. In addition, only in those same two LTCFs, cases of COVID-19 in health care teams were confirmed, showing a RT-PCR positivity rate of 40% (4/10, LTCF #8) and 60% (3/5 at LTCF #14). High positivity rates of COVID-19 in care giver teams of LTCFs that experienced COVID-19 outbreaks have also been observed in investigations carried out in the United States. In these studies, an average of 7.4% positivity was reported in health care teams of 15 LTCFs tested soon after an initial case of COVID-19 was identified, contrasting with the average of 1.0% positivity in care giver teams of 13 LTCFs with no COVID-19 identified 16 . In our study, the LTCFs affected by outbreaks had a higher positivity rate among their team members than observed in the literature, suggesting that specific characteristics such as living conditions (frailty and degree of dependence) of the residents in these LTCFs would require special care on the part of the health team and close contact for daily activities; however other specific risk factors for the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should be investigated in these settings. The prevalence of COVID-19 in the community is another important factor that may impact the number COVID-19 cases and deaths in nursing homes 18 and should be considered in the context of investigations carried out in LTCFs during outbreaks.",
