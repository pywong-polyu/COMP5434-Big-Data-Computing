Highthroughput screening (HTS) offers an opportunity to rapidly identify such compounds. In this work, we have developed a homogeneous cell-based HTS system using AlphaLISA detection technology for the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein (NP). Our assay measures both recombinant and endogenous NP from viral lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) in a sandwich-based format using two monoclonal antibodies against the NP analyte. Viral NP was detected and quantified in both tissue culture supernatants and cell lysates, with large differences observed between 24 and 48 h of infection. We simulated viral infection by spiking recombinant NP into 384-well plates with live Vero-E6 cells and were able to detect the NP with high sensitivity and a large dynamic range. Antiviral agents that inhibit either viral cell entry or replication decrease the AlphaLISA NP signal. Thus, this assay can be used for high-throughput screening of small molecules and biologics in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Over the past decade, amplified luminescent proximity homogeneous assay (AlphaLISA) technology has emerged as one of the most reliable screening technologies because of its versatility, sensitivity, and homogeneous format without the need for plate evacuation or washing. 9\u221211 AlphaLISA signal is generated when a donor bead is excited at an appropriate wavelength to general a reactive singlet oxygen radical that when in close proximity to an acceptor bead activates the acceptor bead to produce light at a specific wavelength. 9 It can be used to replace ELISA that requires multiple plate-washing steps for the quantitative detection of analytes. The conjugation of antibodies to biotin and streptavidin aids in the creation of a screening system that can be used as a competitive assay or sandwich assay format. In a competitive assay that uses one antibody, unlabeled analyte would compete with a labeled analyte donor or acceptor and decrease signal. In a sandwich assay, two antibodies raised against the same immunogen analyte, albeit at different epitopes, will both bind to the analyte and lead to an increase in signal. For SARS-CoV-2 research, AlphaLISA technology has been utilized to identify inhibitors of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein receptor binding domain (RBD) by attaching the donor and acceptor beads to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor protein and S protein RBD, respectively. 12 The SARS-CoV-2 virion is made of four main component structural proteins including S protein, envelope (E) protein, nucleocapsid protein (NP), and membrane (M) protein. 13 SARS-CoV-2 S protein is responsible for initial host-cell binding to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor via the RBD found within the S1 subunit. 14 E protein is embedded in the viral membrane and plays a role in viral particle packaging and maturation. 15 M protein regulates replication and RNA packaging. 13 NP binds M protein and interacts with the viral genome to bind the positive strand RNA viral genome, and NP is the main focus of the work presented here. 13 Here, we describe the development of a high-throughput SARS-CoV-2 NP-based immunoassay in the AlphaLISA sandwich assay format that can be used to detect live virus infection and replication in host cells to carry out HTS for drug discovery and development. We show the selection process for identifying the most reliable antibody pair to detect NP, along with the optimization of the AlphaLISA reagents for the highest sensitivity and dynamic range using recombinant NP. We further demonstrate this assay can detect the SARS-CoV-2 NP in cell lysates and tissue culture supernatants (TCS) after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, we have simulated viral infection by spiking recombinant NP into Vero-E6 cells grown in in 384well plates, along with full plate statistics using recombinant NP in media, demonstrating the assay potential for HTS. The results presented here demonstrate a rapid, homogeneous SARS-CoV-2 NP assay that can be used for HTS of compound collections to identify compounds that inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection and viral replication in live cells.",

NP is one of the four structural proteins present in the SARS-CoV-2 particle, and its levels increase with viral replication as more viral particles are produced. Thus, the level of NP can serve as an indicator of virus infection and replication in host cells. The cell-based AlphaLISA SARS-CoV-2 NP detection assay relies on the proximity of two labeled antibodies that bind to NPs in cell lysate and supernatant in high-density microplates to generate a luminescent signal.

Multiple antibodies were matrixed together to determine which antibody pair produced the highest AlphaLISA signal (counts) from recombinant NP at 10 000 pg/mL ( Figure 1B ,C). The three best antibody pairs were 1 + 4, 11 + 4, and 11 + 10. Each pair was then tested against a titration of recombinant NP at 10 000, 1000, 100, and 0 pg/mL, and produced a concentration dependent signal increase, with signal to background ratios (S/B, 10 000\u22120 pg/mL) of 66.2, 72.8, and 51.5, respectively (Figure S-1). On the basis of these results, pairs 1 + 4, and 11 + 4 were selected for further optimization. Interestingly, the pairs consisting of antibody 11 did not detect the histidine (His)-tagged NP ( Figure 1B ) but generated the best signal with untagged NP ( Figure 1C ), suggesting the His-tag interferes with binding of antibody 11 to NP.

We observed a significant hook effect at concentrations of recombinant NP above 320 ng/mL for pair 1 + 4 and 1600 ng/mL for pair 11 + 4 ( Figure 2 ; Table S-1). The hook effect indicates the concentration of analyte at which an overabundance of analyte titrates the donor and acceptor away from each other, and this hooking dictates the upper limit of detection before the signal will start to decrease. Two different lysis buffers were used to optimize any lysis buffer effects: The NCATS lysis buffer consisted of 0.5% Triton-X 100 with protease inhibitor; the other was the AlphaLISA lysis buffer from the manufacturer.

In most cases, the two-step assays performed better with 20 000 cells/well as measured by S/B ratios. The effect of media and cell density was also tested for assay interference. Media affected pair 1 + 4 to a greater extent than pair 11 + 4, while cell density did not significantly affect S/B ratios. The lower limit of detection for both pairs was 0.22 ng/mL with an upper limit at or beyond 400 ng/mL ( Figure S-6) .",

The main difference between the LBs was that a signal plateau was observed for the NCATS LB indicating an upper limit of detection of approximately 1500 ng/mL, whereas the AlphaLISA buffer could potentially detect higher concentrations. Importantly, the sensitivity of the assay with NCATS LB reveals a similar lower limit of detection of 0.23 ng/mL as in previous experiments, whereas the AlphaLISA buffer was observed be less sensitive, for example, with a lower limit of detection of 2.06 ng/mL for 10 000 cells/ well.",

In this work, we have designed and developed through meticulous optimization an AlphaLISA sandwich-based detection system to identify the SARS-CoV-2 NP. Here, two antibodies were identified to detect recombinant and virally generated NP both in solution and in cell culture. Importantly, we demonstrated a significant increase in NP with longer incubation of virus-infected Vero-E6 cells and were able to quantitatively assess the NP concentration using standard curve interpolation. This assay system should be able to identify compounds that decrease the presence of SARS-CoV-2 NP as a measure of antiviral activity that prevents either viral entry or replication leading to the translation of NP in cells. Our add-and-read system requires no wash steps or removal of cell culture media, providing an excellent methodology for the use in BSL 3/4 facilities that require simple and easy to use assay technologies for drug screening and validation. The selection of SARS-CoV-2 NP was a strategic one in that mutations of the SARS-CoV-2 viral genome will likely occur in coding regions that are selected for during viral\u2212host interactions. The SARS-CoV-2 S protein that protrudes from the envelope binds ACE2 with high affinity as the first step in viral infection, 16 whereas the viral NP is located deeper within the virion core. Indeed, mutations in S protein have already been identified, with one of those being the more infectious D614G mutation. 17\u221219 By targeting NP, this detection system will maintain its reliability for drug screening of multiple viral strains, barring significant changes to the epitopes to which the antibodies used in the AlphaLISA sandwich assay bind.",

Reagents were added using a fully automated BioRAPTR FRD Workstation (Beckman Coulter). Briefly, 8 uL of cell culture media with or without NP was added to columns 3\u221224 and columns 1\u22122, respectively. Next, 2 uL of 5X AlphaLISA Lysis buffer was then dispensed to wells and agitated for 30 min. Then, 4 uL of mixed biotinylated anti-NP antibody and AlphaLISA acceptor beads were dispensed into each well and incubated for 60 min. Last, 2 uL of streptavidin donor beads were dispensed and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. The plate was then read on the Pherastar with an AlphaLISA module from BMG Labtech. Z-factor, CV, and S/B was calculated for the entire plate.",
