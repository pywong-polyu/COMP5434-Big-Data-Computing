            "text": "Background: The outbreak of COVID-19 has been defined by the World Health Organization as a pandemic, and containment depends on traditional public health measures. However, the explosive growth of the number of infected cases in a short period of time has caused tremendous pressure on medical systems. Adequate isolation facilities are essential to control outbreaks, so this study aims to quickly estimate the demand and number of isolation beds. Methods: We established a discrete simulation model for epidemiology. By adjusting or fitting necessary epidemic parameters, the effects of the following indicators on the development of the epidemic and the occupation of medical resources were explained: (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease healing time, and (4) population mobility. Finally, a method for predicting the number of isolation beds was summarized through multiple linear regression. This is a city level model that simulates the epidemic situation from the perspective of population mobility. Results: Through simulation, we show that the incubation period, response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, disease healing time, degree of population mobility, and infectivity of cured patients have different effects on the infectivity, scale, and duration of the epidemic. Among them, (1) incubation period, (2) response speed and detection capacity of the hospital, (3) disease healing time, and (4) population mobility have a significant impact on the demand and number of isolation beds (P <0.05), which agrees with the following regression equation: N = P \u00d7 (\u22120.273 + 0.009I + 0.234M + 0.012T1 + 0.015T2) \u00d7 (1 + V).",

The t-test showed that the independent variables of incubation period, population mobility rate, hospital response time and healing time significantly affected the number of isolation beds (P < 0.05) (Table 6 ). Finally, we obtained the following regression equation (R 2 = 0.841): N = P \u00d7 (\u22120.273 + 0.009I + 0.234M + 0.012T1 + 0.015T2) \u00d7 (1 + V) N indicates a number of isolation beds. P represents population, which refers to the total population in the corresponding area. I represents incubation period of the epidemic. M represents population mobility rate, which refers to the proportion of people in motion to the total population. T1 represents hospital response time, which refers to the time it takes for a patient to develop the first symptom until a clear diagnosis is obtained. T2 represents healing time, which refers to the average time from admission to discharge. T1 and T2 can be estimated based on a certain number of cases. Considering that a certain number of isolation beds should be reserved to cope with emergency situations, The data for each curve is the average of 10 simulations. The peak number of cumulative confirmed cases and inpatient cases increased with the decrease in the isolation capacity. In addition, with the decrease in isolation capacity, the corresponding date of the peak inpatient number was delayed and the duration of isolation facilities at their full capacity increased. Isolation capacity had no effect on the newly confirmed cases and the value of Rt.",

By tracking this phenomenon, it was found that the patients in the incubation period and without mobility restriction caused a high level of transmission before displaying symptoms by contacting others, which was similar to the views of Jiang, Rayner & Luo (2020) and . To contain an outbreak, early detection of suspected cases is critical (De Salazar et al., 2020) . Some studies have described that a longer incubation period may be beneficial for epidemic control (Kahn et al., 2020) , as this allows the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to have more time to deal with the overall epidemic. This conclusion may be more applicable to some known diseases, but for unknown diseases, we believe that a longer incubation period represents a more dangerous signal, making the development of the epidemic uncontrollable (Kahn et al., 2020; Lauer et al., 2020) . Due to the reduced predictability of the disease outbreak scale, it is more difficult to track patients. As a result, the disease may spread to a wider range of people, making it difficult to control. Our results showed that increasing hospital response speed could improve infectivity and scale of an outbreak, which is consistent with previous research (Chan et al., 2020; Hellewell et al., 2020; Wu, Leung & Leung, 2020) . Shortening the hospital response time depends on the public's awareness of epidemic prevention and the level of medical technology. On the one hand, the public needs to pay more attention to the epidemic and actively cooperate with early detection; on the other hand, medical technology determines the time it takes for the detection method to give an accurate result. In addition, if sufficient isolation facilities can be provided, the centralized isolation of all suspected patients who cannot be excluded can also help reduce the hospital response time (Bai et al., 2018; Chen et al. 2020a) .",

In the actual epidemic situation, the amount of medical resources will be less and more scarce than usual. Therefore, it cannot be considered that the population mobility has no effect on the duration of the outbreak. The detailed consequences of inadequate medical resources are discussed in section 3.2. In extreme cases, all people stopped activities, i.e., when the mobility rate is 0%, the overall scale of the epidemic is dramatically reduced, and the corresponding date of the epidemic peak sharply advances. It is speculated that the disease may saturate in a small area after taking this extreme prevention and control measure; thus, the transmission will be completely blocked. Since there is no new-generation infection, different transmission laws are displayed.",

In our model, the hospital isolation capacity does not affect the ability of to detect the disease and diagnosis patients, so it has no significant effect on the maximum number of newly confirmed cases and their corresponding dates. However, the increase in the duration of isolation facilities at full load shows a more severe overload of the medical system.

Population mobility rate had no effect on the value of Rt. However, the different transmission laws are displayed in extreme cases.Full-size \ue90d DOI: 10.7717/peerj.11629/fig-5",
