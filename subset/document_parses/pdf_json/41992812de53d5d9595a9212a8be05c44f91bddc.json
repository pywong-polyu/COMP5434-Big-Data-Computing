The specialty of gastroenterology, with its screening and diagnostic endoscopic procedures in ambulatory endoscopy centers (AECs), has been no exception, with most outpatient clinics and centers being locked down for extended periods. 1 In addition to the short-term effects, it is expected that the COVID-19 pandemic will have a lasting and significant impact on the practice of outpatient endoscopy. 2 As AECs struggle to reopen cautiously with the gradual resumption of diagnostic and elective endoscopic procedures, multiple governmental and society guidelines have been published. These guidelines have focused on the recommended changes in operational logistics and workflow, such as appropriate use of personal protective equipment (PPE), screening and pretesting of staff and patients, use of heightened sanitation protocols, and practice of social distancing to minimize the risk of spread of COVID-19 infection. [2] [3] [4] [5] An AEC is typically a busy, high-throughput facility in which timely, safe, and cost-effective patient-centric care with an emphasis on outcomes is a must for successful operation. The extensive changes in the AEC workflow that will be needed in the post-COVID-19 era is sure to disrupt the regular workflow of most AECs and will have an unknown but significant impact on patient volumes, staff utilization, process times, and by extension the overall net revenue generated by the AEC.",

DES is a computerized virtual simulation technique where interactions between patients and environments of fixed and human resources can be modeled based on the different sequences of events that happen in actual practice in chronological order. 6 Using the software, we created a virtual healthcare environment using realistic 3-dimensional visuals and guided patient process flow designed to simulate the movement of a patient as he or she moves through the AEC from entry to exit for undergoing specific procedures, interacting with staff and resources customized by patient attributes (Fig. 1 ). Milestones were embedded at different points of the workflow to monitor and quantify performance indicators. The various performance indicators considered in this model with definitions are shown in Table 1 AEC, Ambulatory endoscopy center; RN, registered nurse; CRNA, certified nurse anesthetist. *Physicians and CRNAs are reimbursed for billable professional services that are not included in the facility fees. yValue-added time was calculated using the average costing method by dividing total average staffing utilization time (when the staff was actively engaged in patient care or related activities) divided by the total staffing time. 11 Initial observation and audit of the AEC Before building the simulation model, the workflow of a community-based 2-room AEC was carefully observed, and an historical review of the staffing pattern and the number of cases performed each day over the last 2 quarters of 2019 was assessed for estimation of the model input parameters as part of an ongoing quality improvement effort.

Simulation length was fixed to 1 day and did not require any warm-up period because the system was reset each day. In this model, it was assumed that a finite number of staff, procedure rooms, and endoscopists would be available at any time, and patient flow was restricted based on their availability. Endoscopes, preprocessors, waiting room capacity, and ancillary equipment, such as weighing scale and wheelchairs for transport, were assumed to have unlimited availability for maximizing throughput. 9 Occupancy costs; costs related to equipment, drugs, and materials; and fixed and overhead operational costs were not considered because they are unlikely to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. No significant capital outlay for COVID-19-related AEC workflow modifications was considered. Specific strategies of disinfection (such as the use of ultraviolet germicidal irradiation) or related to decreasing environmental risk dissemination (increasing number of air exchanges, external air exhaust) or interventions such as flipping (alternating) rooms, prolonged turnover times, and EGD-only rooms have not been widely studied or validated and are not routinely recommended. Standard reprocessing algorithms for endoscope reprocessing are considered adequate. 10 It is expected that in the reopening phase, the administrative staff (typically the nursing administrator) of the AEC will bear additional responsibilities for patient and staff safety, appropriate use of PPE, retraining staff, infection control practices, scheduling and ensuring supply chain stability, and coordination with local regulatory authorities.

Incorporating a day-ofprocedure COVID-19 screening and testing protocol in the AEC led to a significant decrease in staff utilization and an increase in facility time, wait time for patients, and cost per case (Fig. 3) . Also, if the additional time required for COVID-19 screening and testing exceeded 30 minutes, then the day-of-procedure screening was not practical and would have to be performed day(s) before the procedure. Such an arrangement would invariably lead to an increase in patient inconvenience and decreased compliance given the need for quarantine until the day of the procedure.",

However, doubling the number of COVID-19 testing and screening to 2 triage technicians led to a more acceptable but still significantly increased total facility time and cost per case of $142.

Multiple publications have used DES to understand and optimize healthcare system operation in settings such as operating rooms, intensive care units, emergency departments, and urgent care settings. 14 Only a few published articles used DES techniques in the context of outpatient endoscopy centers. Berg et al 6 used DES to assess the impact of procedure room-to-endoscopist ratio in improving efficiency. Day et al 11 used DES to show the effects of minor changes such as reducing scheduling and recovery room times in improving staff utilization and other performance measures. All these studies were done in academic medical centers in an hospital outpatient department (HOPD) setting, which has different levels of reimbursement and often with the participation of trainees. 11, 12, 15 In this study, incorporation of recommended post-COVID-19 related workflow modifications adversely impacted the efficiency and utilization of an AEC across a wide array of performance indicators and with significant financial implications. Although done in the setting of a community-based stand-alone AEC, the baseline results of this study are generally similar to the results published by other authors in terms of waiting time and staff utilization. Another strength of the study is that the simulation model was validated using historical survey data from other community-based AECs across the country. 13 Also, to account for significant variations in procedure type, payor mix, and non-Medicare reimbursement and to introduce stochastic randomness in the process flows of the simulation model, an uncertainty analysis was used with the Monte-Carlo analysis to make the results more generalizable. The model was responsive to the calibration of parameters such as time and number of triage technicians for COVID-19 testing and screening to minimize the impact of COVID-19-related adjustments on baseline performance indicators. From the simulation model, it was clear that if more than 30 minutes is required for day-of-procedure COVID-19 testing and screening at the time of entry into the AEC, then it would lead to an unacceptable increase in facility time and wait times, causing a significant decrease in daily throughput. Although this model was specifically developed to evaluate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the operation of community-based AECs, to the author's knowledge performance indicators of community-based AECs have not been published earlier using DES modeling techniques. Because reimbursements for facility fees for AECs are continuously decreasing, there is an urgent need to maximize the operational efficiency of community-based AECs and decrease the cost of care to offset the diminishing net revenue per case. 16 A DES model using local data is an easily implantable strategy to pinpoint areas of inefficiency, establish a center-specific benchmark, and assess the impact of strategic interventions to improve throughput and efficiency.",

Significant uncertainty and ambiguity exist for the optimum process flow needed for screening and testing for COVID-19. As the pandemic evolves, likely these process flows will also change. The development of a safe and effective vaccine may drastically change this workflow. In addition to the expense related to the cost of PPE, the focus of the analysis was on the impact on staffing cost, which is the largest component of the total operating expense in a typical community-based AEC. 13 Other fixed operational costs, which are unlikely to change in the post-COVID-19 period, were not assessed. Patient satisfaction metrics are one of the critical components of performance indicators of any endoscopy center. However, currently there are no data on patient satisfaction parameters in the post-COVID-19 period. Although real concern exists for loss of revenue related to the possibility of increased cancellation of procedures by patients because of COVID-19 infection fear, this was not considered in the model. Also, this model may not apply to large multispecialty ambulatory surgery centers or to hospital-based outpatient facilities.",
