For example, WHO recommends cleaning surfaces with water, detergents and disinfectants usually effective to clean the environment 12 , because SARS-CoV-2 should be very susceptible to most cleaning agents as an enveloped virus. Some studies using other coronaviruses as the surrogate performed in the last decades have reported the effects of a number of disinfectants for the mitigation of the coronavirus: the ethanol at concentration >62%, isopropanol, povidone iodine, sodium hypochlorite and quaternary ammonium compounds combined with alcohol are effective for surface disinfection [13] [14] [15] [16] . In turn, hydrogen peroxide vapor, chlorine dioxide, ozone, and UV light could be applied to reduce viral load present in aerosols [17] [18] [19] [20] . And several recent studies have performed the in vitro evaluation of disinfection effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 suggested that alcohol-based disinfectants such as ethanol and isopropanol, and some alcohol-free hand sanitizer and UV light are really effective against SARS-CoV-2 16, 21-23 .",

In addition, there is some divergence about whether some disinfectants work best against SARS-CoV-2. For instance, one prominent review article reported that benzalkonium chloride was probably \"less effective\" against SARS-CoV-2, which was cited by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) of the United States as a reason to avoid using benzalkonium chloride-based hand sanitizer products [25] [26] .

Due to the insufficient treatments and vaccine, prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 via droplets and contaminated surface is the primary intervention during the prevalence of COVID-19 in most parts of the world. Several previous studies have performed the in vitro evaluation of disinfection effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 and these studies all have suggested that alcohol-based disinfectants such as ethanol (EA) and isopropanol (IPA) are effective 16, 21-22, 30-31 . Conversely, the disinfection effectiveness of low-level disinfectants in the limited number of studies, such as chlorhexidine gluconate and benzalkonium chloride, is not very unclear yet 23, 25 .In this study, we evaluated virucidal efficacy of two QAC disinfectants, a kind of low-level disinfectant, against SARS-CoV-2 in detail. The first synthesis and recognition of their antimicrobial activity occurred almost 100 years ago, but it was not until after World War II that QACs came into widespread use. Today, they are used in numerous consumer products and in the food and health care industries for cleaning, sanitizing and disinfecting surfaces. Their low toxicity and ability to beformulated for specific applications and target organisms help account for their widespread use. QACs are cationic detergents (surfactants or surface-active agents). They reduce surface tension and form micelles, allowing dispersion in a liquid. QACs are active ingredients in over 200 disinfectants currently recommended by the USA EPA to inactivate SARS-CoV-2 27, 32 . However, only a few detailed efficacy reports, including in vitro or in clinical trials, could be searched so far. Here we determined the virucidal effect of MCP (QAC disinfectant, approved by EPA officially) and a novel QAC disinfectant (FWD) in detail. Our results show that all of them are very effective at inactivating SARA-CoV-2. The virucidal efficacy between MCP and FWD vary slightly at concentration of 0.06% because they are a little different in composition. As we known, QACs are classified on the basis of the nature of the R groups, which can include the number of nitrogen atoms, branching of the carbon chain, and the presence of aromatic groups.These variations can affect the antimicrobial activity of the QAC in terms of dose and action against different groups of microorganisms, and the length of the R groups can also greatly affect their antimicrobial activity33 . In addition, the potential environmental impact of QACs, which may include disruption of wastewater treatment unit operations, proliferation of antibiotic resistance, formation of nitrosamine disinfection byproducts, and negative effects on biota of surface waters,",

We wonder how about their virucidal activity after these QAC disinfectants are diluted and kept for a period of time at RT. Then the virucidal activity of MCP and FWD were tested after they were diluted and kept at RT for one week (MCP-1W and FWD-1W,Table 2). Our results showed that their virucidal effect was decreased a little, but they can still be effective against SARS-CoV-2 when we used the disinfectant with the same concentration and kept longer contact time. It is amazing that 0.06% MCP can still inactivate SARS-CoV-2 completely with more than 8 minutes of contact time even it has been kept for one week at RT. These results indicated that the virucidal activity against SARAS-CoV-2 of MCP and FWD are very stable and enough contact time is important, which may be important to all QAC disinfectant. time to inactivate the virus. But, as an amphoteric surfactant, it could be used in daily chemical products usually because of its lower toxicity to human. In this case, it viruses and fungi. And the degree of effect depends on the percentage concentrations of the alcohol and the physical properties of the target microorganism. The optimum bactericidal concentrations of alcohols range from 60% to 90% v/v solutions in water but are generally ineffective against most microorganisms below 50% v/v 29 .

The similar virucidal activity in our study indicated FWD could be considered as a very potential alternate for MCP.W30, as another kind of low-level disinfectant based on amphoteric surfactant, is not likely to be very effective compared with QAC disinfectant and ethanol. However, surfactant has several advantages for skin disinfection. It is non-toxic, less irritating and non-flammable and can be used in many household cleaning/hygiene agents, such as hand soap and shampoo. We would like to highlight that this kind of amphoteric surfactant, such as W30, is also able to inactivate SARS-CoV-2. Thus household cleaning and skin hygiene using such products containing W30 may also act as a contributing factor to limit the spread of SARS-CoV-2, potentially reducing the need for the use of disinfectants in settings with limited availability.One significant point of our study is that we use the integrated cell culture-qPCR method to validate virus inactivation effect of disinfectants. Even though traditional virus detection methods in the inactivation validation study utilize CPE and TCID 50 assay/plaque assay as the gold standard, there are still several disadvantages. For example, when the initial titre of virus used for inactivation effect test is low, RF>4 could not be reached or longer incubation times are needed. To find a more feasible strategy, we involved pretreatment of the virus with disinfectant and quantify the virus titres using qPCR. This method utilizes the host cell as an efficient tool to separate infectious and noninfectious viruses because only the living virus can inject its genome into the host cell for amplification. The cells were incubated for an optimized period to amplify the viruses, decrease the limit of quantitation and improve the sensitivity of detection.We conclude that QAC disinfectants, MCP and FWD, are highly effective for the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2. Beyond merely inactivating the virus, QAC disinfectants act quickly, making them practical for use in healthcare setting and laboratories where prompt disinfection is important. In addition, the low-level disinfectant based on amphoteric surfactant, W30, which may present in commonly available household cleaning/hygiene agents is also able to inactivate SARS-CoV-2.
