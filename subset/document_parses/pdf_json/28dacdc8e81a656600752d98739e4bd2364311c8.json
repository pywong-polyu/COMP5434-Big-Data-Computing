            "text": "Case studies conducted after recovery from acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 have frequently identified abnormalities on CMR imaging, suggesting the possibility that SARS-CoV-2 infection commonly leads to cardiac pathology. However, these observations have not been able to distinguish between associations that reflect pre-existing cardiac abnormalities (that might confer a greater likelihood of more severe infection) from those that arise as consequences of infection. To address this question, UK Biobank volunteers (n=1285; 54.5% women; mean age at baseline, 59.8 years old; 96.3% white) who attended an imaging assessment including cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic were invited to attend a second imaging assessment in 2021. Cases with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection were identified through linkage to PCRtesting or other medical records, or a positive antibody lateral flow test; n=640 in data available on 22 Sep 2021) and were matched to controls with no evidence of previous infection (n=645). The majority of these infections were milder and did not involve hospitalisation. Measures of cardiac and aortic structure and function were derived from the CMR images obtained on the cases before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection from images for the controls obtained over the same time interval using a previously validated, automated algorithm. Cases and controls had similar cardiac and aortic imaging phenotypes at their first imaging assessment. Changes between CMR imaging measures in cases before and after infection were not significantly different from those in the matched control group.",

In brief, an early report from Wuhan, China described imaging evidence of cardiac abnormalities in 58% of retrospectively recruited patients who recovered from COVID-19 5 . As many as 78% of a younger German cohort imaged after SARS-CoV-2 infection showed abnormal CMR findings, such as increased cardiac muscle MRI T1 that had a modest relationship to elevated high-sensitivity troponin T 6 . Approximately one-quarter of a group of 58 hospitalised COVID-19 patients with persistent limitations to exercise tolerance who were imaged 2-3 months after discharge from the hospital had regional cardiac MRI T1 relaxation times that were increased relative to matched controls, a pattern associated with myocarditis 7 . Another study of a small group of athletes after recovery from COVID showed that 46% had late gadolinium enhancement on cardiac MRI, with 15% showing cardiac regional T1 and T2 relaxation times that were increased related to healthy control values 8 .

After the onset of the COVID pandemic, a nested case-control study was developed with the aim of re-imaging (at the same imaging centre and using an identical imaging protocol) about 100-cases with evidence of previous SARS-CoV-2 infection matched to 1,000 controls without evidence of previous infection, both of whom had undergone imaging assessment prior to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic for reimaging (at the same imaging centre and using an imaging protocol identical to that for their first assessment) between Feb-Oct 2021. Their data provides a unique dataset comprehensively characterising brain and systemic health before and after SARS-CoV-2 infection that is linked to state-of-the-art clinical imaging. Here we provide a preliminary report of the CMR findings based on images available up to 22 Sep 2021.",

Convolutional neural networks were used for segmentation of cardiac or aortic cine images [16] [17] [18] , from which volumes or areas of the cardiac or aortic structures were calculated. The ejection fractions of the cardiac chambers were calculated from the maximal and minimal volumes across the cardiac cycle. The aortic distensibilities were calculated from the maximal, minimal cross-sectional areas of the aorta and central pulse pressure 14 . Global circumferential, radial and longitudinal strains of the LV myocardium were evaluated by use of non-rigid image registration techniques for cardiac motion tracking 3 . In total, we utilised 27 cardiac and aortic imaging measures for subsequent statistical analyses.

Other possible explanations of our largely negative findings are that the cases were predominantly milder (not involving hospitalisations) or that CMR abnormalities after infection may be reversible in part (and thus dependent on timing of observations with respect to the acute disease), e.g., lower ventricular circumferential or radial strain measures for COVID patients < 8 weeks after recovery from the acute infection than those for > 8 weeks was reported recently 25 .",
