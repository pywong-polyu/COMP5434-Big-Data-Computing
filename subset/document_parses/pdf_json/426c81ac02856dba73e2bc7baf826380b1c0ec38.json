Complementary to the existing spontaneous reporting system, The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb conducted patient-reported cohort event monitoring (CEM). Objective The primary aim was to investigate differences in the frequencies of any and commonly reported, 'well-known', systemic adverse events following immunization (AEFIs) with four COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer's Comirnaty \u00ae , Moderna's Spikevax \u00ae , AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria \u00ae and the Janssen vaccine). As a secondary aim, we analyzed the frequencies of wellknown systemic adverse events after the first and, if applicable, second COVID-19 vaccinations, taking into account age, sex and prior COVID-19 infection. Methods Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in the Netherlands starting in February 2021 were analyzed using a prospective cohort design. Results Data of 27,554 participants who received one vaccination and 20,682 participants who received complete immunization were analyzed. The percentage of patients reporting any AEFI was high and ranged from approximately 53% for the Pfizer vaccine to approximately 94% for the Moderna vaccine. The frequency of serious AEFIs was low, with the highest frequency found for the AstraZeneca vaccine (0.228%). AEFIs were most often experienced by participants receiving the first dose of the AstraZeneca and Janssen vaccines and the second dose of the Moderna vaccine; the Pfizer vaccine was associated with the lowest rate of AEFIs. Participants with a COVID-19 history before vaccination experienced commonly reported systemic AEFIs more frequently after the first vaccination than after the second vaccination. Women and young people experienced more AEFIs than men and older people, respectively. Conclusions The analysis of a large cohort provides important information about the rates of AEFIs across age groups, among brands of vaccines and between those with and without prior COVID-19 infection. Participants reported a high number of AEFIs in general, but the frequency of serious AEFIs was low.",

This necessitated the rapid development of vaccines to contain the spread of this virus. At the end of 2020, the first vaccines were granted preliminary approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA). Starting in January 2021, a large-scale vaccination program was rolled out in the Netherlands. At present, this vaccination program includes four vaccines: two based on viral vectors (AstraZeneca's Vaxzevria \u00ae [3] and the Janssen vaccine [4] ) and two with an mRNA basis (Pfizer's Comirnaty \u00ae [5] and Moderna's SpikeVax \u00ae [6] ). The number of vaccines given in the Netherlands, stratified per dose, age and sex, is shown in Fig. 1 . Detailed information on vaccines given is provided in Electronic Supplementary Material (ESM) 1. The rapid rollout of vaccines for a large proportion of the population necessitated a strong emphasis on safety. Complementary to the existing spontaneous reporting system, The Netherlands Pharmacovigilance Centre Lareb conducted patient-reported cohort event monitoring (CEM). It is considered complementary because it is better suited to capture comprehensive safety data over time and the impacts of more frequent adverse events. Moreover, in contrast to the",

Throughout the entire study, participants receive a total of six online questionnaires about events attributed to COVID-19 vaccination over a period of 6 months. We included data from five questionnaire timepoints after the baseline questionnaire. This corresponds with a period of 3 months after the first vaccination. The timing of the second vaccination varied for vaccine brands in the Netherlands; For the Pfizer vaccine, a vaccination interval of 6 weeks was used between the first and second vaccination, for Moderna 4 weeks and for AstraZeneca 12 weeks [10] . For those who received a second dose, the date of the second vaccination and brand of vaccine was obtained. In the current analysis, data from the first questionnaire, which was sent 7 days after the vaccination date, and data after the second vaccination, if applicable, were analyzed. We asked about events attributed to vaccination, and referred to reported reactions as AEFIs. An event attributed to vaccination was defined as any atypical medical event that followed immunization and does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the use of the vaccine. Adverse events were defined as any unfavorable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease [11] . The core data elements from the questionnaire can be found in ESM 2.",

During the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccines, a larger and more diverse population was vaccinated, making it possible to study the safety profile in a real-world setting [15] . With the LIM system, a web-based tool for collecting patient-reported outcomes, important insight into the occurrence of AEFIs after the first and second doses of different COVID-19 vaccines was obtained. A large prospective cohort study from the UK that collected patient-reported data through an app found that systemic AEFIs were reported by 13.5% of participants after the first dose of the Pfizer vaccine and 22% after the second dose. For the AstraZeneca vaccine, the number of systemic AEFIs was higher after the first dose (33% of participants) than after the second dose. Systemic AEFIs were more common among individuals with previous COVID-19 infection than among those without known past infection for both vaccines [16] , similar to the results in our study. Chapin-Bardales et al. [17] analyzed mRNA vaccine data obtained from an active surveillance system for COVID-19 vaccine recipients in the US. They also found that systemic reactions frequently occurred after the first dose, but they were more frequently reported after the second dose among both Pfizer and Moderna vaccine recipients. This study also showed a higher frequency of AEFIs after the second dose of the Moderna vaccine, while for the first and second doses of the Pfizer vaccine, such AEFIs were comparable. Similar to Menni et al. [16] , we postulate that the increased reactogenicity relates to increased immunogenicity after previous COVID-19 infection. Previous studies have shown that COVID-19 vaccines increase immunogenicity in individuals with past infection, and these individuals rapidly develop higher antibody titers than those without previous infection [18, 19] .",

However, there is a potential risk for loss to follow-up among those with AEFIs with serious outcomes. For serious outcomes, additional follow-up was requested if necessary. This could include asking participants for hospital discharge letters or other medical information in order to assess the association between the vaccination given and the reported adverse reaction.",
