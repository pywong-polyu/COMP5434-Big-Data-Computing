All the HCPs responded to all 7 items on their attitude regarding COVID-19. Findings demonstrated highly positive attitude of HCPs towards COVID-19. About 97.80% (n=405) individuals strongly agreed that gowns, gloves must be used when dealing with infected patients and equal proportion of respondents strongly believed that diseased patients should be kept isolated. More than 80% participants strongly agreed that transmission of COVID-19 could be prevented by following universal precautions given by WHO, CDC and that healthcare workers must acknowledge themselves with all the information regarding COVID-19. Similarly, 76.80% (n=318) HCPs had positive attitude regarding \"intensive and emergency treatment should be given to diagnosed patients\", and 70% (n=290) participants strongly agreed that \"any related information should be disseminated among healthcare workers\". On the other hand, 69.10% (n=286) HCPs strongly agreed that prevalence of infection could be controlled by actively involving in infection control programs. Practice among HCPs towards COVID-19 Fig. 4 represents the responses obtained for practice assessing items of questionnaire. Majority of respondents had good practice regrading each item with highest practice showed among HCPs towards washing of hands with soap or cleaning with sanitizers (96.10%, n=398). A lower percentage of good practice was observed among HCPs in avoiding to touching of eyes, nose or mouth (84.30%, n=349).", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "attitude and practice of HCPs toward COVID-19 in Pakistan. The study also highlighted possible barriers perceived by HCPs in infection control practices. For HCPs, good knowledge, positive attitude, and good practices of following precautionary measures such as wearing gloves, protective clothing, goggles and face mask is imperative in effective dealing with infected patients with minimum risks. Also, ongoing pandemic nature of disease made it necessary for HCPs to multiply their alarms corresponding to critical situation and to put efforts in following and implementing related hygienic conditions as well as recommendations. On the other hand, healthcare professional's good knowledge and practice in complying precautionary measures creates awareness among patients as well as gives an important message in society [21]. Findings of current survey demonstrated that majority of HCPs have good knowledge (93.2%, n=386), positive attitude (mean 8.43) and good practice (88.7%, n=367) towards COVID-19. Of note that, 87.68% HCPs utilized social media as a main source of information while only 23.19% seek information from seminars & workshops.

Possible explanation is that good knowledge among HCPs might lead to positive attitude towards COVID-19. This is also augmented by positive linear correlation between knowledge and attitude found in present study. Giao et al and Bhagavathula et al also reported that majority of HCPs have positive attitude towards COVID-19 [10,22]. Interestingly, participant's attitude didn't differ statistically (P>0.05) by age, gender, experience and job. Giao et al also found that attitude level regarding COVID-19 didn't have any association with age (P=0.151), gender (P=0.129), and experience (P=0.453) but found statistically significant association with occupation/job [22]. While Albarrak et al and khan et al didn't found any difference in attitude towards MERS among doctors, pharmacists, and nurses (P>0.05) [25,26]. Results revealed that majority of HCPs have good practice in following precautionary measures.
