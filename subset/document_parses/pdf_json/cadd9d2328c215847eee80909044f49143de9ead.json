In Spain, the effect has evolved from being anecdotal in January 2020 to become the second country in Europe with the highest number of cases (614,000 cases by 17/09/2020), which has affected the health system and caused major mobility restrictions. In contrast, COVID-19 has affected air pollution and energy consumption in the country. This article analyzes the indirect effect produced by this pandemic on air pollution, referenced to various stages that occurred in Spain: first stage, without public awareness of COVID-19 impact (mid-January 2020); second is when Spanish Government alerted (late February 2020); and third, after the decree of alarm and mobility restriction of citizens by the government (March 2020) along with the various phases of the de-escalation. The indirect effect produced by this pandemic on air pollution in Spanish cities has been resulted in a decrement of 70% to 80% of average, taking into account dates after the decree of alarm and mobility restriction by the Spanish government (14/03/2020), compared to days prior to that date. Thus, the results of this analysis indicate a significant alteration in air pollutants; these alteration patterns have followed similar paths over different countries worldwide improving the air quality as discussed by Dutheil et al. (Environ Pollut (Barking, Essex: 1987) 263:114466, 2020.",

Factors such as a drastic closing of economic activity, industry, and transport have affected the environment indirectly reducing the number of air pollutants such as PM 10 and NO 2 . Satellite images show the reduction of CO 2 up to 25% in China due to the coronavirus crisis (approximately 200 million tons) (EPA 2020). After the pandemic impact on Italy, satellite images were taken by the European Space Agency (ESA) also show the decrease of pollutant concentration, such as nitrogen dioxide CO 2 (ESA 2020) (a toxic compound that negatively affects the air quality, in addition to being a greenhouse gas) in the country. A reduction of air pollutants is common during times of crisis (Web2 2020) . This is due to less mobility of people and transportation among with the reduction of economic activities that depend on fossil fuel, responsible for CO 2 emission. This gas is one of the main greenhouse gases, while NO 2 is a highly toxic gas associated with vehicles that run on diesel. Although initially, these measures have created positive impacts on the environment, researchers fear that the situation will turn back once the pandemic is overcome. The International Energy Agency (IEA) can pose a threat to climate action in the long term, by reducing the investment in clean energy (IEA 2020) . It should be taken into account that with the revitalization of the economy, pollution levels will rise again. However, this situation can be controlled by taking necessary measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, it is worth mentioning the tendency of air quality within international cities analyzed over a similar period of time as it is in this paper. Regarding the Asian continent, the values of air pollutants are presented at higher rates as the most polluted cities are located in this continent (Rodr\u00edguez-Urrego and Rodr\u00edguez-Urrego 2020). Despite having a higher pollution rate, it is noticeable the decreasing in air pollutants and their emissions once the outbreak of COVID-19 started (Rojas et al. 2021 ) and how it has been linked to the disease since the outbreak.",

Therefore, this article tackles the indirect effect produced by this pandemic on air pollution in reference to various stages that occurred in Spain. Five cities have been chosen in order to analyze the evolution of air pollution, cities such as Valencia, Madrid, Barcelona, Sevilla, and Bilbao. These cities are of high interest due to their large urban and high-traffic areas, where the rolled traffic on a daily basis is higher than other Spanish cities. The study for these cities has been conducted first, when there was no public awareness of the COVID-19 impact (mid-January 2020); second, when Spanish Government alerted (late February 2020); and third, after the decree of alarm and mobility restriction of the citizens by the government (March 14th, 2020), along with the different phases of the de-escalation. The state of alarm decreed by the Spanish government from March 14th imposes the confinement of citizens; the reduction of the circulation of private vehicles; reduction of busses, taxis, and railways services; and partial closure of Spanish airspace. These restrictions occurred at the same time in all Spanish cities.",

Nitrogen oxides (NO 2 ) and PM 10 require special attention. The first of them is originated by the combination of nitrogen and oxygen present in the air as a consequence of combustion processes, including road traffic, while PM 10 particles are also originated during combustion processes (carbonaceous particles, soot), although they can also have a natural origin (fine sand and other particles) due to the wind. In addition to particle analysis, measurements of meteorological parameters are made to determine the dispersion of pollutants such as temperature, humidity, wind direction, and speed, as well as atmospheric pressure and solar radiation. The normally used model for the weather station is the model called GAIA-A13 (Fig. 2) .",

Despite being in the technological era, humankind struggled against the health disaster which abruptly appeared. To control this pandemic, most countries adopted, as an effective measure, the lockdown on social and economical activities in order to avoid the transmission of the virus. All this shows a significant drop in suspended pollutant particles. First, a drastic decrease in pollution in China was observed, later on in Italy and almost immediately in Spain. Due to the pandemic crisis and actions taken by the Spanish government, the electricity demand has been considerably reduced up to 25% compared to January, referring to the week after applying the alarm state (14/03/2020). This implies lower pollutant emissions as a consequence of electric power production plants.",
