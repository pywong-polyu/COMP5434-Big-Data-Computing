            "text": "We propose an optimisation method for the inverse structural design of self-assembly of anisotropic patchy particles. The anisotropic interaction can be expressed by the spherical harmonics of the surface pattern on a patchy particle, and thus arbitrary symmetry of the patch can be treated. The pairwise interaction potential includes several to-be-optimised parameters, which are the coefficient of each term in the spherical harmonics. We use the optimisation method based on the relative entropy approach and generate structures by Brownian Dynamics simulations. Our method successfully estimates the parameters in the potential for the target structures, such as square lattice, kagome lattice, and dodecagonal quasicrystal. arXiv:2109.10102v1 [cond-mat.soft] 21 Sep 2021",

            "text": "The self-assembly of nano-and colloidal particles is a spontaneous organisation of the small particles into structures [1] . The self-assembly forming complex patterns is of great interest because of the promising applications in materials engineering, such as photonics, energy storage devices, tunablerheology fluids [1, 2] . The special properties of these materials originate from the material structures and the physicalchemical properties of the components made of the materials [3, 4] . Understand, control and predict self-assembly structure from given building blocks is a challenging goal in the field of soft matter. The self-assembly of complex structures, particularly open structures such as kagome lattice [5] , honeycomb lattice [6] , diamond structure [7] , icosahedral quasicrystal [8] , however, has not fully understood yet. The main difficult issue is to determine building blocks which are capable of forming the desired structure, and the underlying kinetics and mechanism of the assemble process, i.e. the interaction of such building blocks and the conditions, e.g. temperature, dispersity will determine the outcome structure. The interaction of building blocks depends on the block and the solvent. The building block can be isotropic [8, 9] or anisotropic [10] . In the later case, the building block is varied in shape [11] , local sphere clusters [12] , patchy particle [1, 13] , etc. The patchy particle is often described as a spherical particle patterned with anisotropic surface, or attached with interacting patch on its surface [1, 13, 14] . Recent developments in synthesis and fabrication techniques have enabled the realisation of those patchy particles [5, 15] . The assembly of patchy particles has led to the discovery of new order structures, phase diagram, and the extraction of some general features such as the formation of hierarchical assembly [16] . Discovering the relation of particle design and selfassembled structure employs forward approach or inverse approach. In the conventional 'forward' self-assembly approach, a specific potential or anisotropic particle is used to discover the assembled structure. Conversely, in 'inverse' approach a class of computational technique is used to discover the suitable type of potential or anisotropic particle which is capable of forming a desired target structure [4, 17, 18] . For patchy particles, the infinite degrees of freedom of patchiness result in a great flexibility to achieve several complex structures. However, it also poses questions on the inverse problem: how to choose a suitable particle design for a specific structure among several possible particle designs. To determine suitable interactions for stabilising self-organisation, the optimasation techniques have been continuously developed for both isotropic interaction [6, [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] and anisotropic interaction [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

The algorithm is based on relative entropy method [17] to optimise the yield of the target structure in the design parameter space. We apply the model to find suitable patchy particle designs for given target structures. The patchy particle in the study is a spherical particle whose surface pattern is based on spherical harmonics, thus any pattern can be described by a linear combination. [14] Such pattern consists of two type of regions which is an analogical to a polarised surface or even the surface charges of complex biological molecules [13, 28, 29] . Then one can set either repulsive or attractive interaction to the like/opposite patches, for example setting like patches repulsive and opposite patches attractive, which is similar to the charged interaction. The main feature of our patterned patchy particle system involves the complex interplay between the attractive and repulsive anisotropic interaction, and the capability of systematically exploiting the relation between the patchy particle symmetry and the self-assembly. Compared to the patchy particles with specific narrow attractive sites (sticky-patch model) where the patch number, patch arrangement and patch type are important features determining the assembled structure and properties, the particle in our approach are less involved with those factor. We expect that the experiment can be carried out more flexible by tuning the external parameters (solvent pH, salt concentration) [13, 15] and the fabrication required less strict conditions on such as a sophisticate geometry and chemical selectivity.",

For demonstration, the potential includes five candidates corresponding to five types of patchy particles Y 10 , Y 20 , Y 22 , Y 44 , Y 55 , as shown in Fig. 1 . The particle Y 10 and Y 20 can be referred as Janus particle and triblock particle, respectively. They are axisymectric about the polar axis (n (3) ). The particle Y 22 , Y 44 and Y 55 has twofold, fourfold, and fivefold symmetry in the equator plane spanned by (n (1) , n (2) ). The patchiness of a particle can be determined by its positive (red) and negative (blue) pattern. In this model, \u03b8 > 0 means that different colour patch is attractive and similar one is repulsive, while \u03b8 < 0 means similar colour patch attractive and different is repulsive. The sign of \u03b8 implies different interaction and physics of the self-assembly, therefore it can be considered as a prior knowledge for the design of patchy particle. Since the sign of \u03b8 is often fixed by materials of the patches, we can set either \u03b8 \u2264 0 or \u03b8 \u2265 0. We may also set the sign unconstrained. The detail of the anisotropic function \u039e lm , the Morse potential u M , and the Week-Chandler-Anderson potential u WCA preventing the overlapping of particle and can be found in Appendix. The self-assembly of patchy particles is performed by Brownian dynamics [30] under annealing. In each simulation, the spherical particles are confined to a flat plane while rotate freely in three dimensions. The periodic boundary condition is applied on the two-dimensional space. The number of particles in each iteration is N = 128 for square lattice and kagome lattice, N = 240 for dodecagonal quasicrystal. Initially the positions and orientations of particles are randomly distributed. Temperature is decresed from T max to T min with an interval of \u2206T . The values of T max , T min , \u2206T are respectively 0.5, 0.05, 0.01 for square lattice and kagome lattice, and 1, 0.2, 0.0125 for dodecagonal quasicrystal.",

A particle configuration R is described by a set of N particles' positions R = [r 1 , r 2 , ..., r N ]. Let P tgt (R) denote the probability distribution of a target structure, and P(R|\u03b8) denote the probability distribution for realising the configuration R given \u03b8. Here P(R|\u03b8) follows Boltzmann distribution P(R|\u03b8) = e \u2212\u03b2U(R|\u03b8) Z(\u03b8) , in which the configurational partition function Z(\u03b8) is a normalisation factor as Z(\u03b8) = e \u2212\u03b2U(R|\u03b8) dR, and U(R|\u03b8) is the tunable potential. One way to measure the distance between those two distributions is to use Kullback-Leibler divergence [31] . With the use of f (R) P(R|\u03b8) = f (R)P(R|\u03b8) dR, the Kullback-Leibler divergence from P(R|\u03b8) to P tgt (R) can be written as D KL (P tgt ||P) = P tgt (R) ln P tgt (R) P(R|\u03b8) dR = ln P tgt (R) P tgt (R) \u2212 ln P(R|\u03b8) P tgt (R) .",

As for the synsthesised targets, particle positions and orientations of the square and the kagome lattice are perfectly assigned based on their unit cells. The synthesised dodecagonal quasicrystal target is constructed as an approximant crystal by suitable packed dodecagonal motif [33] , however the orientation is too difficult to perfectly assign. We overcome this problem by numerically stabilising the approximant crystal under the potential type same to the one used for ground truth. Finally, the minimal targets, which have only information of particle position, are also considered. In this case, the orientation of target is a hidden parameter. However, because the orientation of the target is required for each iteration, we statistically interpolate the orientation fields from the generated structure and assign to the target. The algorithm of the interpolation of orientation can be found in Appendix D.

            "text": "The performance of the optimisation method is confirmed by inverse design of the ground truth target structures. Such ground truth target structures are prepared from a specific Y lm potential as given in Eq. (1) . The information of the ground truth target includes both positions and orientations of all particles. For the ground truth square lattice target assembled from Y 10 patterned particle, Fig. 3 shows the typical behaviours of the constrained \u03b8 \u2265 0. As shown in Fig.  3(a,c) , a solution containing the only non-zero \u03b8 10 \u2248 1 is quickly obtained, and the generated structure is identical to the ground truth target. We also prepare a synthesised lattice whose surface distance between particle is set zero, and orientation of polar basis n (3) is exact. Compared to the ground truth case, the behaviour of \u03b8 in Fig. 3 (d) is qualitatively similar. However the weight is \u03b8 10 = 1.2, which is the upper limit of \u03b8. The reason of this difference can be explained as follows: according to the estimation of \u03b8 given in Eq. (3) and (4), the terms \u2207 \u03b8 U of the generated structure and the target is distance-dependent. The distance between particles in the synthesised target is smaller than that of the ground truth (the first peak of radial distribution function for synthesised target and ground truth is 2a and 2.08a respectively; data are not shown). Since the interaction decays with distance, the term \u2207 \u03b8 U tgt of synthesised target has greater magnitude as shown in Fig. 3(b,e) , leading to \u2207 \u03b8 10 U \u2212 \u2207 \u03b8 10 U tgt = 0 for the synthesised lattice optimisation. As a result, \u03b8 10 keep increasing until it reaches the upper limit. The result for the synthesised target suggests that the optimisation scheme can work when the distance between particle in the target is not strictly assigned, i.e. similar behaviour of \u03b8 is expected when the optimisation is conducted for a synthesised target whose distance between particle is larger or smaller. Additionally, it should be noted that in synthesised target, we assign only the polar basis (the n (3) in Fig.1 ) of particle while the information of azimuthal bases (n (1) and n (2) direction) are random; because the Y 10 particle is axisymetric, so the information of the polar basis is enough to attain a minimum energy structure. This result suggests that the model can work when the target contains partial information of the orientation.",

The difference between the value of \u03b8 20 in such two cases is mostly due to the particle distance in the two targets, as mentioned in previous paragraph.

For synthesised target, the same potential is used to numerically stabilise a position-fixed approximant crystal. Different from the synthesied target of square lattice and kagome lattice, we do this process to find the minimum energy state of the approximant because it is too difficult to assign the orientations to the particles. When \u03b8 \u2264 0, after a few iterations the optimisation model is capable of finding the suitable potential with \u03b8 55 \u2248 \u22120.9 for ground truth and \u03b8 55 \u2248 \u22120.7 for synthesised target. Although these values deviate from the expected value around \u22121, the convergence of \u03b8 behaves similarly and the only nonzero parameter for the estimation refers to the Y 55 patchy particle design. It is confirmed that the generated structures by those parameters have features of a dodecagonal quasicrystal, which are the 12-fold symmetry in their Fourier transforms in Fig. 5(b,d) , and the similarity with the radial distribution of the ground truth target as in Fig. 5(e) . Regarding the difference in estimation result, one possible reason is that the number of particles used in those simulation is quite small, therefore the periodic boundary condition can inhibit the growth of the quasicrystal and the relaxation of defects. For the synthesised target, the difference in the obtained value and expected value is more obvious. As mentioned previously, such effect is also caused by the particle distance in the generated structure and the target, which is also illustrated in Fig. 5(e) .",

The capability of forming a square lattice for such kind of particle is intuitively understandable.

Figure 7 shows a quantitative comparison of the structures obtained by the three particle types, by analysing the distribution of the number of nearest neighbours and the six-fold bond-orientational order parameter [41] |\u03c8 6 |. If a particle is a part of kagome lattice, it has four nearest neighbours and |\u03c8 6 | = 1. From the figure, for three types of patchy particle, the significant rate of n nb = 4 and |\u03c8 6 | \u2265 0.7 suggests that the structure is a kagome lattice [5] . In the case Y 10 + Y 20 , compared with the particles patterned only with Y 10 or with Y 20 , the number of more-than-4-neighbour particles smaller while the number of less-than-4-neighbour particles larger, implying that the structure has more open local structure. Moreover, the system has more particles whose \u03c8 6 > 0.9 , suggesting the kagome lattice is clearer. This result reveals that the combination of Y 10 and Y 20 is able to create a much better kagome lattice than using only one of them. As depicted in Fig. 7 , under the combined potential, the resulted kagome lattice has less defects, more open structure, and the shape of the unit cell is clearer than the case using the single component Y 10 or Y 20 . A qualitatively similar phenomenon is observed for the enhanced self-assembly kagome lattice from tri-block particle whose the self-propel activity is added to the pole direction of tri-block particle [34] . The tri-block particle and the adding of self-propulsion can be respectively referred to the Y 20 and Y 10 in our study. Although the nature of enhancement by the self-propulsion [34] is different from the patchy particle Y 10 , they are similar in terms of symmetry of the interaction between the particles. These results suggest that our study is capable of finding new designs for patchy particle so that the self-assembly is enhanced.",

The pairwise interaction potential includes several to-be-optimised parameters, which are the coefficient of each term in the spherical harmonics. We successfully estimate patches necessary to reproduce the targets such as two-dimensional square lattice, kagome lattice and dodecagonal quasicrystal. The method also works for hidden information for the square and kagome lattices, i.e. the target contains only the minimal information of the position of particles. The estimation is dependent on the type of a target structure, namely, prior knowledge of the structure that we want to reproduce. The prior knowledge of the range of the parameters is also crucial for the estimation. Here, we discuss those effects, as well as the possible extension of the model.",

            "text": "We have considered three kinds of target structure: the ground truth target comprises both the particle position and orientation, the synthesised target has its particle position set in perfect order and orientation obtained via minimum energy, and the minimal target has only information of the particle position. For the periodic target like square lattice and kagome lattice, the optimisation model is capable of finding the suitable solution design so that the desired targets can be obtained. Regarding the performance of the estimation for three types of target, it shows that as the more information on the target is provided, the faster the optimisation process is. For example in the case of square lattice target (Fig. 3 and Fig. 6 ), for the ground truth and synthesised targets, the stable and converging solution can be consistently obtained after just a few iterations, whereas the minimal target requires more iterations. The minimum target does not have data on the orientation, so the optimisation involves searching on a higher dimension space. As a result, it is more difficult to estimate the parameters. We also observe that the occurrence for finding the correct solution of minimum target is often lower than the other target. Among many independent estimation processes for each square lattice target, the solutions for ground truth and synthesised ones are all consistent and can reproduce a square lattice structure, while for the minimum target cases about 50% of the estimations can. However, such disadvantage is compensated by the fact that more possible solutions and \"better\" solutions can be found. In detail, when the mini- mum targets are considered, we have found two possible particle designs for the square lattice, three for the kagome lattice in which a combination design improves the lattice. On that account, one can consider different levels of prior knowledge for target structure. Here is an example for the self-assembly of kagome lattice. From the lattice, one can think that there can be at least two ways to design the particle's patches and the corresponding orientation of those particle in the lattice. Intuitively, the design based on narrow sticky patch consists of four small patches located on the same plane at alternating interval of 60 \u2022 and 120 \u2022 so that they fit the four contact points [35] [36] [37] [38] . However, self-assembly of those particles shows that a rhombus lattice is more favourable and formed instead of kagome one [35] [36] [37] [38] . The kagome lattice structure is formed only when constraint on patch selectivity is added [37, 38] . Another solution is the axisymmetric particle, then the orientation of particle can be inferred, which is similar to the one in synthesised target. Using such kind of information for the target will result in the finding of Y 20 particle design, in which two opposite identical caps are attractive while the equatorial part is repulsive [5, 34, 39] .",

Aside from the difficulty caused by the hidden orientation as discussed above, there are several factors hindering the process. The target does not have information of particle orientation, so it is necessary to assign the orientation from the generated structure to the target. In the generated structure, the effect of thermal fluctuation is inevitable. Such fluctuation is also captured and passed to the target. In other words, simply imagine that the number of patches on the particle Y 55 of quasicrystal is large, the size of the patch is thus small, and then the fluctuation may lead to a considerable effect. So the effect of this fluctuation on the estimation outcome is more severe than that of the square lattice and kagome lattice. Another factor is that compared to the formation of the aperiodic lattice like dodecagonal quasicrystal is difficult and thus requires more investigation on the suitable temperature range, annealing rate, as well as the influence of the other potential components.",

            "text": "In this study, the sign of \u03b8 involves the way the patch interacts, thus the potential type and fabrication technique. The patchy particle has two kind of regions (red and blue) on its surface, and different-kind region is set attractive for \u03b8 > 0, while same-kind region is set attractive for \u03b8 < 0. It should be noted that the self-assembly is completely different when the sign changes. Applying constraint on the sign of theta also affect the optimisation result. We analyse this issue via the optimisation of the ground truth square lattice in three cases: \u03b8 \u2265 0, \u03b8 \u2264 0, and unconstrained sign. When \u03b8 \u2265 0, the unique solution is \u03b8 10 \u2248 1 and the generated structure is similar to the target (Fig. 3) . When \u03b8 < 0, as shown in Fig. 8 , the only solution is \u03b8 20 \u2248 \u22121, however the structure consists of many 4-, 5-, 6-nearest neighbour particles and is quite irregular. When the sign of \u03b8 is not constrained, we are able to obtain a lattice similar to the target in terms of both position and orientation, however the solution is a combination of \u03b8 10 \u2248 0.5 and \u03b8 20 \u2248 \u22120.5. The contribution of \u03b8 10 > 0 to the formation of the square lattice is well confirmed. It facilitates the head to tail alignment of the Y 10 particles, and the side-by-side or parallel alignment. The \u03b8 20 < 0 corresponds to the tri-block particle similar to the one for kagome lattice. The rise of \u03b8 20 < 0 in this case enhances the head-to-tail configuration, and possibly also enhances the parallel alignment because the particle with \u03b8 20 < 0 (i.e. the equatorial parts are attractive) is more energetically favourable. It is interesting that using \u03b8 20 < 0 alone creates a undesired structure, but a combination with another design \u03b8 10 > 0 can create the desired structure. About the choice of sign-constraint, it depends on the situation, for example when the interaction of the red and blue patch is already set, then the constraint is a must. Setting either positive or negative \u03b8 often requires less number of iterations because the design parameter space is reduced. The consideration of unconstrained \u03b8 may spend more computational cost, but the estimation can lead to richer possible outcomes of patchy particle design.",

We have increased the number of parameters to 9 by adding four more types of patchy particle Y 30 , Y 31 , Y 32 , Y 33 and performed inverse optimisation for a ground truth square lattice. Regarding the computation cost, the time for each iteration increases by around 30% compared to the 5parameter case. The computational cost scales almost linearly in the number of parameters. This is appealing compare with the conventional grid search, in which the cost scales exponentially. As shown in Fig. 9 , the estimation result of \u03b8 is unique and consist of two nonzero parameters \u03b8 10 \u2248 0.65 and \u03b8 30 \u2248 0.25. The estimation is comparable to the 5-parameter case in Fig. 3(a) . The rise of \u03b8 30 is understandable because the Y 30 has similar symmetry to the Y 10 , which promote the head- tail configuration. There is some fluctuation for \u03b8 32 , but such fluctuation does not affect the generated structure.

            "text": "For a given target, information of the target is required. Such information is often the positions of particles, or the density field. In the case of patchy particle, the orientation indicating the patches must be known. In reality the orientation may not be measured. In this case, the orientation must be treated as a hidden variable. Our approach is that the orientation of the target is interpolated from that of the generated structure during each iteration.From the position and orientation of the particles in generated structure, we aim to (i) compute the local orientation field of the generated structure, and (ii) statistically estimate the orientations of particles in targeted structure. From a given generated structure consisting particles of the position {x 1 , x 2 , ...} and orientation {n 1 ,n 2 , ...}, where x \u2208 R 2 and n \u2208 R 3 in this study, the orientation fieldn(x) is locally estimated. Consider the particle i, the neighbour j can be determined if the distance ||x j \u2212 x i || \u2264 r nb , and let m(i) be the number of neighbours of particle i. Thenn(x) is taken from the probability distribution P(x j ,n j ) under fixed position and orientation of particle i, i.e. translate and rotate the jth particles so that x i = 0 andn i is on some axis. This is written as x j \u2192 x ji = x j \u2212 x i andn j \u2192 R(n j |n i ). The position of x j is implicitly rotated. Apply kernel density estimator for arbitrary position x in the system, the density of position of j and orientation of j is determined aswhere x ji = x j \u2212 x i (after the transformation), N is the number of particle i \u2208 [1, N], G(x) is Gaussian kernel (kernel with the shape of a Gaussian curve) defined and normalised as2\u03c3 2 , and . i j is mean over i and j. Here Gaussian kernel is applied for both position x and orientationn in Eq. (D1) and (D2). For the n-dimension data, we apply a one dimensional Gaussian curve sequentially in the n dimensions. The equations (D1) and (D2) includes the density distribution of the neighbours orientations and position around a",
