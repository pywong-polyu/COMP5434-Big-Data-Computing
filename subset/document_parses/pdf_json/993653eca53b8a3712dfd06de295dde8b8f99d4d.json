For people who are visually impaired and people with visual and hearing impairment, navigating through the digital world can be as precarious as moving through the real world. To enable them to connect with the digital world, we propose a solution, Haptic Encoded Language Framework (HELF), that uses haptic technology to enable them to write digital text using swiping gestures and understand the text through vibrations. Method We developed an Android application to present the concept of HELF and evaluate its performance. We tested the application on 13 users (five visually impaired and eight sighted individuals).",

Overall, the reading accuracy has been found to be approximately 91%, and the average CPM is found to be 25.7. Conclusion The volunteering users of the HELF Android application found it useful as a means of using the digital media and recommended its usage as an assistive technology for the visually challenged. The results of their performance of using the application motivate further research and development in the proposed work to make HELF more usable by people who are visually impaired and people with visual and hearing impairment.",

            "text": "The use of touch as a mode of communication was proposed by Geldard in the twentieth century [1, 2] . Touch sensation can be an effective method for interaction and perception. People with eyesight often do not realize the extent to which the sense of touch is useful in knowing about surroundings. They perceive the surroundings mostly with their eyes and ears. On the other hands, people who are visually impaired are bound to use their non-visual senses in their daily life activities. These non-visual senses include hearing/audition, taste, smell, and touch. In the absence of visual ability, the sense of hearing is primarily used [3] . However, speech feedback may not be very useful in public places and other noisy environments [4] . The use of tactile senses [5] can be beneficial for the people who are visually impaired and people with visual and hearing impairment. The usage of sense of touch has evolved through the years to guide humans about surroundings through the reception of non-visual stimuli like pressure, pain, and changes in temperature guiding the movement in the space around and also about positioning and movement of the limbs [6] . Haptic technology combines the use of the tactile senses with the field of computer science and engineering [7] .",

This can enable people with visual impairment to understand and read digital text on their screens using different patterns of small vibration pulses and long vibration pulses. Simple swiping gestures can be used for the digital text using HELF. Reading and writing using HELF may initially entail time and patience to learn, but can be highly beneficial once learned. HELF can potentially be an effective way of communication for our intended users and can enable them to get convenient access to the digital world. We developed a new haptic language for the framework (named HELF Script) instead of using braille or any such language already available for people who are blind, because digital braille is difficult to recreate in terms of development as well as usage without the need of any extra hardware. Also, braille typing is prone to errors when used with flat touch screens of smartphones. The HELF Script developed, on the other hands, can be more accessible, as it can conveniently use the existing haptic hardware present in modern smartphones without using any external hardware or device apart from the user's smartphone.",

The HELF code is a dynamic vibration pattern which consists of a sequence of vibrations and gaps (named as HELFabets (shown in Table 1 )). We make use of two variants of vibrations (short and long) and two types of gaps (letter gap and word gap) making one HELF code for the script. For ease, we provide a nomenclature to the HELF characters (variations of vibrations and gaps used). The nomenclature is provided in Table 2 . These codes have been designed to approximate the inverse of the letter frequency in the English language character. The frequency of words has been used from the work of Jones and Mewhort [31] . The combined frequency (Com. Freq.) is obtained by summing the upper case frequency and lower case frequency of the alphabets (listed in Table 2 ). Most frequently occurring letters will have the shortest and easiest HELF code. (Number of vibrations patterns will be least and have least complex HELFabet combinations.) These codes can be memorized by people who are visually impaired and people with visual and hearing impairment. Once skilled in it, these codes are interpreted easily and thus can be effortlessly used for reading and writing using smartphones. Table 2 lists the HELF codes for the alphabets and digits.",

The writing module was taken first where the subjects were asked to type the phrases from each module. The results were noted based on time taken by the subject to type each phrase correctly by the subject based on which the CPM was calculated later. The subjects themselves got to know if the typed character is absolutely correct or not, by listening to the announced character typed by text-to-speech module used in the test HELF Android application. The reading module was given later followed by a short break after the writing test. We have counted only the absolutely correct words to calculate the CPM score, so even if one alphabet goes wrong in the desired word, we waited for the user to correct it and the correction time was also included in the CPM. Appendix I shows the three modules used for assessing the usage of the proposed framework using the application developed. The testing data for the reading and writing module were collected for content analysis. The reading part of the application could be best tested by people who have both visual and hearing impairment. This, however, required training such users, which in turn required skilled professionals. Also, due to the pandemic (Covid-19) situation, we were unable to test it on people with both visual and hearing impairment.",

The performance analysis was done for both writing and reading the HELF codes. The test sheets used for evaluation of the usage of the HELF using the android application are shown in Appendix 1. Table 5 shows the recorded results of using the HELF application by the volunteers (Table 5 for sighted volunteers and Table 6 for visually impaired volunteers). Figure 2 presents the analysis of the recorded results in a graphical manner. The bar graph presents the performance of participants. The horizontal axis represents the modules or number of characters required to read and write using HELF. The vertical axis represents the number of percentage accuracy of reading, and the average characters per minute (CPM) for writing of each module in the testing phase. Figures 2  and 3 show the graphs for the eight sighted volunteers, and Figs. 4 and 5 show the graphs results for the five visually impaired users. As is evident from Fig. 2 , average accuracy for reading in case of sighted users slightly decreases throughout. The plausible reason could be that Module 1 consists of characters with the easiest and shortest HELF codes, whereas Module 2 consists of characters with HELF codes having higher complexity. Similarly, characters in Module 3 consist of numbers along with least used alphabets in English language which have the most complex HELF codes as compared to the other two modules. Hence, there is a slight linear drop in the reading accuracy graph. This is due to the increasing complexity of HELF codes with each module, which needs time to learn and memorize, especially in case of sighted people who are not accustomed to using such a system.",

Having a close look at the graph, we observe a slight drop in accuracy for Module 2, which is because Module 1 has shorter HELF codes and smaller words but as we move to Module 2 the word size HELF codes size increases drastically.

Testing and training: The training phase was constrained by a time limit, and the testing was performed using three modules. Extended training and further tests can assure the validity of the presented results. Testing the application on participants with hearing and visual impairment could further proclaim the effectiveness and usability of the application. 3. Different testing hardwares: All participants were provided with different smartphones from different brands. Not all phones have the same haptic engines, which can lead to slight lag in vibrations or a significant difference can be felt for the intensity of vibrations.",
