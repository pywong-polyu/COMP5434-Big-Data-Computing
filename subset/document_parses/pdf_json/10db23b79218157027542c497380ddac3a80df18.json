Methods: Antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus were assessed in 297 individuals with a dosing gap of 12 weeks, sampled 12 weeks post second dose (cohort 1) and in 77 individuals with a median dosing gap of 21.4 weeks (cohort 2) sampled 6 weeks post second dose. ACE2-blocking antibodies (ACE2-blocking Abs), antibodies to the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of variants of concern (VOC), and ex vivo T cell responses were assessed in a subcohort. Results: All individuals (100%) had SARS-CoV-2-specific total antibodies and 94.2% of cohort 1 and 97.1% of cohort 2 had ACE2-blocking Abs. There was no difference in antibody titers or positivity rates in different age groups in both cohorts. The ACE2-blocking Abs (p < .0001) and antibodies to the RBD of the VOCs were significantly higher in cohort 2 compared to cohort 1. 41.2% to 65.8% of different age groups gave a positive response by the hemagglutination assay to the RBD of the ancestral virus and VOCs in cohort 1, while 53.6%-90% gave a positive response in cohort 2. 17/57 (29.8%) of cohort 1 and 17/29 Immun Inflamm Dis. 2022;10:e592.",

However, after it was rolled out to the public, due to the delay in obtaining the second dose, most individuals received their second dose 20 weeks after obtaining their first dose. We showed that at \u226516 weeks postimmunization with a single dose of AZD1222, 93.7% of those >70 years had SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies, although ACE2 receptor-blocking antibodies (those that correlate with neutralizing antibodies) was significantly less in those >60 years of age. 5 However, robust memory T cell and B cell responses were seen in over 90% of individuals. Although it has been shown that an increase in the gap between the two doses subsequently led to higher antibody titers, 6 there are limited data in the differences in dosing gaps on antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern (VOCs), differences in antibody responses in different age groups as well as with those with comorbidities, and also the influence of the dosing gap on T cell responses.",

To answer these questions, we compared the immune responses of two cohorts of Sri Lankan individuals who received the AZD1222 vaccine at 12-week dosing intervals and another cohort who received the vaccine at a median of 21.1 weeks dosing interval. We also investigated the kinetics of antibody and T cell responses in the first cohort (12-week dosing interval), 13 who consisted of health care workers, to find out if there was waning of immunity.",

The hemagglutination test (HAT) titers for the WT, B.1.1.7, B.1.351, and B.1.617.2 were compared between the two cohorts (C). Individuals in cohort 2 had significantly higher HAT titers to the WT and all VOCs analyzed by the Mann-Whitney test. All tests were two-tailed. The lines indicate the median and the interquartile range In this study, we have compared the antibody and T cell responses of individuals with two dosing schedules, 6 months after receiving the first dose of the AZD1222 vaccine. In the first cohort with a dosing gap of 12 weeks, individuals were recruited 12 weeks post second dose, while in cohort 2, with a dosing gap of a median of 21.4 weeks, individuals were recruited 6 weeks post second dose. We found that all individuals in both cohorts were seropositive and there was no difference in the SARS-CoV-2 total antibodies between the two cohorts. However, cohort 2 had significantly higher levels of ACE2blocking Abs and antibodies to the RBD of the WT and VOCs when compared to cohort 1. The high ACE2blocking Abs and antibodies to WT in the second cohort could be because they were 6 weeks post second dose compared to cohort 1, which was 12 weeks post second dose. Therefore, it is possible that those in cohort 2 had not entered the contraction phase of the memory response by 6 weeks post second dose and therefore had higher T cell and antibody responses. However, both cohorts were 6 months post first dose, and at that time point, those with a longer dosing gap had higher antibody titers. Although we did not assess neutralizing antibodies in this study, ACE2-blocking Abs and antibodies to the RBD detected by the HAT assay have been shown to significantly correlate with levels of neutralizing antibodies. 14,21 Since neutralizing antibodies have been shown to associate with protection against SARS-CoV-2 virus infection, 22 from 6 months post first dose, those with a longer dosing interval appear to have a higher level of protection. An extended dosing gap with the BNT162b2 has also been shown to increase the neutralizing antibody levels with an increase in interleukin-2 producing CD4 + T cells. 23, 24 Therefore, overall the data appear to suggest that a longer dosing interval may associate with a higher magnitude of neutralizing antibody responses.",

This is not surprising as Sri Lanka had a high number of cases from April to June due to the alpha variant 25 and even a higher number of cases with the delta variant from June to the end of September due to the delta variant. 26, 27 Therefore, although a large proportion (11/88) had evidence of infection, the vaccine appeared to have induced an adequate immune response to prevent hospitalization. The waning of neutralizing antibody responses has been observed in especially older individuals with time, and therefore, many countries have recommended a booster dose 6 months after the second dose of the vaccine. 10, 28 Our data show that the increase in the ACE2-blocking Abs post second dose, compared to 4 weeks post first dose was only significantly higher in the younger age groups (20-39 years old), whereas SARS-CoV-2 RBD binding antibodies were significantly higher in older age groups (40-59 years). Therefore, the generation of protective neutralizing antibodies could be age-dependent, which should be further investigated. However, irrespective of age, those who had a prolonged dosing interval appear to have higher antibody and T cell responses and therefore are likely to have higher neutralizing antibody responses for a longer duration from the time they received the first dose. Therefore, the prolonged gap between the two doses may be beneficial in vaccine roll-out by enabling more individuals to receive one dose of a vaccine, but not compromising immunity and possibly delaying giving out booster doses.",
