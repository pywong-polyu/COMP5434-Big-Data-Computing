Response Surface Methodology was used to understand the relationships between the parameters. The experimental data were then fit into mathematical models. The results, for the first time, revealed that the licorice solutions had non-Newtonian shear-thinning behaviors with flow behavior indexes of 0.24 to 0.91, depending on the licorice extract samples, temperature, and \u2022 Bx. These observations were different from those reported in the literature and the present study elaborated on reasons for such observations. Further, the shear-thinning behavior generally increased by increasing the \u2022 Bx and decreasing the temperature. Inl addition, the power-law model was found to be suitable for predicting the experimental data. The newly revealed information can be particularly important in designing the unit operations for licorice extract processing.",

            "text": "Licorice (Glycyrrhiza spp.) is one of the economically important medicinal plants from Leguminosae family. The Glycyrrhiza genus consists of several species but only three of them, that is, Glycyrrhiza glabra L., Glycyrrhiza inflata Bat., and Glycyrrhiza uralensis Fisch., are officially certified by China Pharmacopoeia Committee as medicinal plants that can be used for the production of pharmaceuticals [1] . Inl addition, the extracts obtained from this natural ingredient possesses anti-tumor, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant activities and has been used in the food industry for producing seasoning agents, sweetening agents, drinks, confectioneries, and functional foods [2] [3] [4] [5] . It is also reported that the extract of this plant possesses interfacial and emulsifying properties [6] . Such health-promoting effects are believed to be correlated with the chemical composition (e.g., bioactive compounds) of this plant [7] . The chemical composition of licorice extracts varies depending on serval parameters including the plant species, growing condition, harvesting time, and extraction procedure [8, 9] . However, relatively high concentrations of valuable bioactive components, including flavonoids (e.g., 0.2-2.5% Liquiritin), triterpenoid saponins (e.g., glycyrrhizin), coumarins, phenols, and polysaccharides (e.g., glycyrrhiza polysaccharides), are among the reasons for considering licorice extracts as \"essential herbal medicine\" [10] . Generally, the commercial extracts of this herb are found in liquid, concentrate, or powder forms [11] . The typical process of licorice extract production consists of four consecutive unit operations including grinding the herb roots, mixing with water (often at a ratio of one-to-five), extracting licorice solution usually in an extraction unit, such as hot stirred tank and finally concentration to a about 45 \u2022 Bx. [11] . The concentrate may be later converted to powder or be diluted with water before using as food ingredients.",

Hence, the present study was carried out to explore the rheological behavior of licorice extracts at various concentrations temperatures.

The viscometer used in the present study was equipped with a CP51 geometry (cone and plate). These tests were performed using a closed cone and plate geometry supplied by the manufacturer to minimize moisture loss during the experiment. Inl each experiment, 0.5 mL of licorice extract was placed in the sample compartment. Afterward, a programmed shear rate was applied to the sample. The program consists of a linear increase in shear rate from 0.77 to 140 s \u22121 in 180 steps after temperature equilibrium. The sample holder was cleaned each time and new sample was placed there for the next experiments. Inl addition, the calibration was performed before each set of tests. The graphs of shear stress versus shear rate were analyzed using V3.1 Rheocalc software to obtain the rheological indexes. This was performed by the computer software provided by the supplier.

It was previously explained that the extraction methods, plant origin, growth, and harvesting conditions can affect the composition of the plant extracts [8, 9, 17] . A previous report mentioned that a licorice extract sample collected in Italy contains 42.0% gums and starch, 2.3%, 2.1% sucrose, 5.4% glycyrrhizin, 13.4% moisture content, and about 29.1% insoluble and other compounds [12] . The moisture and ash contents of the samples in the present study ranged between 53.28-62.95% and 7.44-9.63%, respectively. The differences in ash contents of the samples are mainly attributed to plant species, growth conditions, and processing parameters such as the extent of washing of the starting raw materials as well as the design of decantation and filtration stages. Gums and starch are mainly polysaccharides that precipitate in the presence of ethanol. Gums and starch content of samples were in the range of 21.93-32.45%. The similar letters refer to no significant differences at 0.05 level.",

This author reported a Newtonian flow behavior for licorice extract for all concentrations which is different from those observed in the present study. Inl the present study, the experiments were performed using a cone and plate geometry at a wide range of shear rates, i.e., up to 140 sec \u22121 (Figure 1 ). However, in the research carried out by Maskan [20] a Brookfield viscometer Model RVT (Brookfield Engineering Laboratories Inc., Stoughton, MA, USA) with the spindle No. 2 emerged in a 600 mL beaker containing the licorice sample had been used. Inl principle, well-defined geometries such as cone and plate or parallel plates are the geometries of choice for the study of shear rate dependency of solutions and Brookfield viscometer Model RVT with its limitations in terms of using a spindle submerged in a beaker with a large shear rate distribution across the sample does not seem to be suitable. On the other hand, due to the equipment limitations only speeds of 10, 20, 50, and 100 rpm, i.e., shear rates of up to 27 sec \u22121 was tested by Maskan [20] . Such an approach may undermine the validity of the results extracted from the experimental data in that old work. Gabriele et al. (2001) used a rheological-based approach to study the flow behavior of licorice samples with a moisture content of 13% w/w during the extrusion process. These authors employed an oscillatory rheometer equipped with a temperature control unit and obtained the flow curves of the licorice extract from the elaboration of the creep data. According to the authors, a linear relationship between shear rate and viscosity was reported for licorice powder. These different observations, compared to the new information released in the present study, are mainly related to sample specification. Moreover, it should be noted that selecting appropriate systems for studying the physical properties of materials, such as rheological behavior, is a key to collect valid data [20] . Hence, advances in technology may result in more precise data and improve our understanding of science. This could be the case for differences between the observation in the present study with those reported in the past century by Maskan [20] . Inl addition, as explained in previous sections of the manuscript, it is known that the extraction method and other parameters (e.g., plant growth conditions) may affect the chemical composition of the extract, resulting in a different rheological property [21] [22] [23] .

            "text": "The Arrhenius type equation was used to study the temperature-viscosity data (Figure 3 ) as explained in Equation (2) . As a result of this investigation, the activation energy values were calculated. According to the results, for \u2022 Brix of 20, Activation energy (E a ), the proportionality constant (K t ), and R-square were found to be 29,053 (KJ/mol), 4.67 \u00d7 10 \u22123 (mPa\u00b7s), and 0.71, respectively. Further, when the \u2022 Brix was 30, E a , K t , and R-square were 52,713 (KJ/mol), 4.84 \u00d7 10 \u22127 (mPa\u00b7s), and 0.91, respectively. However, when the \u2022 Brix was 40, E a , K t , and R-square were 58,788 (KJ/mol), 4.06 \u00d7 10 \u22127 (mPa\u00b7s), and 0.91, respectively. At the highest degrees of the Brix, it was observed that E a , K t , and R-square were 17,798 (KJ/mol), 7.70 (mPa\u00b7s), and 0.79, respectively. The results showed that the Arrhenius equation is an appropriate model to describe temperature dependency of licorice extract viscosity and the correlation coefficients were found to be in a range of 0.71 to 0.91. Moreover, it was observed that with increasing the degrees Brix (up to 40) the calculated activation energy increased. Therefore, the temperature had a more profound effect on licorice root extract viscosity when the sample had a greater value of soluble solids content. This finding can be particularly useful in the industry where the viscosity of the in-process sample can be adjusted (e.g., by a small change in the temperature) to meet the equipment, such as pump, requirements.",
