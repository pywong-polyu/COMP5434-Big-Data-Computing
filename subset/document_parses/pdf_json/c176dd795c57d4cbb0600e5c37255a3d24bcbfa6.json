            "text": "Introduction: In the trials of corona virus vaccines, detailed analyses of subsets of lymphocytes were not carried out. We present perhaps the most comprehensive immunological analysis of 29 subsets of B and T cells in 2 healthy subjects receiving 2 doses of the Pfizer SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) vaccine. Methods: Analyses were performed prior to vaccination, 3 weeks following the 1st dose, and 4 weeks following the 2nd dose. Total, na\u00efve (T N ), and different memory and effector subsets (T CM , T EM , and T EMRA ) of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells; SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific tetramer+, and cytotoxic CD8+ T; subsets of T follicular cells (T FH , T FH 1, T FH 2, T FH 1/ T FH 17, and T FH 17); B-cell subsets (mature B cells, naive B cells, transitional B cells, marginal zone B cells, class-switched memory B cells, germinal center B cells, and CD21 low B cells), and plasmablasts; and regulatory lymphocytes (CD4+ Treg, CD8+ Treg, Breg, and T FR cells) were evaluated with specific monoclonal antibodies by flow cytometry. Results: A lack of COVID-19 IgG antibodies after the 1st dose in one of 2 subjects was associated with increased regulatory lymphocytes and decreased plasmablasts. Seroconversion after the 2nd dose in this subject was associated with decreased T FR cells and increased plasmablasts. In both subjects, CD4 T EM and CD8 T CM were markedly increased following the 2nd dose. T FH 1 and regulatory lymphocytes were increased (except Breg) following the 1st dose. A striking increase in SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells was observed following the 2nd dose. Conclusion: Our data support the need for 2nd dose of vaccine to induce strong SARS-CoV-2 CD8 T-cell specific response and generation of memory subsets of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Regulatory lymphocytes appear to play a role in the magnitude of response.",

These antigen-activated B cells interact with T FH cells, and follicular dendritic cells, where they undergo proliferation and form GCs. In the GCs, B cells undergo immunoglobulin class-switched recombination and selection of high-affinity antibody producing B cells. Subsequently, B cells leave the GCs to differentiate into long-lived plasma cells and home into the bone marrow to produce antibodies of different isotypes and subclasses. A small population of GC B cells leave the GCs to become CSM B cells.

            "text": "We present the 1st comprehensive study in 2 healthy subjects of the effect of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination on immune responses. Although few immunological responses were reported in vaccine clinical trials, no comprehensive cellular immunological data were published, and majority of the data were specifically for neutralizing antibodies. Sahin et al. [1] reported a 3.5-fold increase in neutralizing the antibody response at a high dose of vaccine as compared to only 0.7-fold increase with the low dose COVID-19 vaccine on day 43. This observation may be of help to use different vaccine doses in designing vaccine trials in children and adolescents. Xia et al. [35] and Zhang et al. [36] reported induction of antibody responses to inactivated SARS- CoV-2 vaccine, BBIBP-CorV, at different doses in all vaccine recipients on day 42. Furthermore, 2-dose immunization induced higher neutralizing antibody responses than a single immunization. Our subject 1 had equivocal IgG antibody response 3 weeks post the 1st dose; however, subject 1 was positive at 4 weeks after the 2nd dose (42nd day following the 1st dose). We did not examine titers of neutralizing versus non-neutralizing antibodies. These data would suggest that the 2nd dose of corona virus vaccine is required to achieve high levels of specific antibodies. This may explain approximately lower 70% protection by the single dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine. The equivocal antibody response after 1st vaccination in our case was associated with an increase in GC cells but decreased plasmablasts. An increase in CD8+ Treg might explain decreased plasmablasts and decreased antibody production without suppressing GC cells. We have reported that CD8+ Treg inhibits plasmablasts without affecting other B-cell subsets including GC [37] and inhibit immunoglobulin production [38] . This cannot be sole mechanisms since subject 2 was antibody positive after the 1st dose and had increase in CD8 Treg; however, increase in CD8 Treg in subject 2 was modest as compared to that in subject 1. T FR cells also regulate antibody production [34] , and therefore, an increased T FR might have also contributed to equivocal antibody response following the 1st vaccination in subjects 1. A decrease in T FR cells following the 2nd vaccination might have contributed to positive antibody responses associated with further increase T FH cells, and GC cells. Subject 2 had no appreciable changes in T FR and CG B cells. These data demonstrate a possible role of T FR in the generation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies.",

[3] reported that in the clinical trial of the Moderna vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 mRNA-1273), older adults (71 years and older) had induction of T H 1 CD4+ T-cell responses in response to Sspecific peptide pool characterized by increased cytokines, IL-2 > TNF-\u03b1 > IFN-\u03b3. T H -2 responses (IL-4 and IL-13) were unaffected. Sahin et al. [1] also reported skewed T H 1 responses in both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells induced with the receptor binding domain peptide. In our subject, we did an extensive analysis of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Analysis of CD8+ T cells and subsets in our subject revealed interesting and somewhat unexpected results. Following the 1st vaccination, the percentage of total CD8+ T cells was severely decreased. Following the 2nd vaccination, a partial recovery of total CD8+ T cells was associated with increased CD8+ T CM cells. The mechanism of marked decrease in total CD8+ T cells is unclear. Dan et al. [15] also reported decreased memory CD8+ T cells in subjects who had recovered from CO-VID-19. CTLs are known to play an important and critical role in the elimination of viruses, therefore potentially influencing the clinical course of COVID-19. In our subject, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein-specific tetramerpositive CD8+ T cells were markedly increased following the 2nd dose as compared to the 1st dose. Functional CTL (CD107a+ granzyme B+ and perforin+) CD8 T cells were increased in subject 1 and remained unchanged in subject 2. Therefore, these data demonstrate development of SARS-CoV-2-specific CD8+ T cells, even in the absence of antibody response (subject 1). T CM and T EM cells are localized in lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, respectively. T CM cells respond to antigen presented by dendritic cells in the spleen and lymph nodes, whereas T EM cells mediate effector functions at extra-lymphoid sites [16, 19] . The increase in CD8 T CM cells and CD4 T EM cells following the 2nd vaccination may provide critical immune responses at lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues, respectively.",

According to secretion of the cytokines and expression of chemokines receptors, T FH cells have been divided into several subtypes. T FH 1, T FH 2, T FH 1/T FH 17, and T FH 17 are able to efficiently induce antibody response by memory B cells. Thevarajan et al. [40] observed the appearance of plasmablasts and T FH cells at 7 days of SARS-CoV-2 infection peaking at day 8 and were present during convalescence. These changes were associated with the development of IgM and IgG anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies. Mathew et al. [39] observed increased activated (ICOS+) T FH cells but observed no difference in PD1+ T FH cells in COVID-19 patients. In the present subject, we also observed increased T FH 1 cells following the 1st dose; however, they returned to the baseline level following the 2nd dose. Gupta et al.

Our data also show that vaccine could induce SARS-CoV-2-specific T-cell responses before the development of antibody response. Furthermore, regulatory lymphocytes, especially T FR , may play an important role in the generation of SARS-CoV-2-specific antibodies. Finally, our study suggests that immune responses following vaccination may be different from those from natural infections. One of the factors for heterogeneity of certain immune responses to mRNA COVID-19 vaccine in our 2 subjects could be age difference. However, that appears unlikely because immune responses to vaccine were better in subject 1 (76 years) than in subject 2 (52 years), suggesting that vaccine may be equally effective in aged subjects.",

However, because of the small number of cases, authors were unable to evaluate the efficacy of the vaccine in aged individuals and different ethnic groups. A phase I study of the Moderna vaccine observed that antibody responses in older subjects were similar to those seen in younger people [3] . However, a number of older subjects were small. Moderna mRNA vaccine showed a 95.6% virus efficiency (VE) for people younger than 65 years, but the VE dropped to 86.4% for people older than 65 years. Pfizer mRNA vaccine showed a VE of 94.7% in individuals older than 65 years, which is comparable to that observed in younger",
