            "text": "The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the urgent need for rapid, accurate, and large-scale diagnostic tools. Next to this, the significance of serological tests (i.e., detection of SARS-CoV-2 antibodies) also became apparent for studying patients' immune status and past viral infection. In this work, we present a novel approach for not only measuring antibody levels but also profiling of binding kinetics of the complete polyclonal antibody response against the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, an aspect not possible to achieve with traditional serological tests. This fiber optic surface plasmon resonance (FO-SPR)-based label-free method was successfully accomplished in COVID-19 patient serum and, for the first time, directly in undiluted whole blood, omitting the need for any sample preparation. Notably, this bioassay (1) was on par with FO-SPR sandwich bioassays (traditionally regarded as more sensitive) in distinguishing COVID-19 from control samples, irrespective of the type of sample matrix, and (2) had a significantly shorter time-toresult of only 30 min compared to >1 or 4 h for the FO-SPR sandwich bioassay and the conventional ELISA, respectively. Finally, the label-free approach revealed that no direct correlation was present between antibody levels and their kinetic profiling in different COVID-19 patients, as another evidence to support previous hypothesis that antibodybinding kinetics against the antigen in patient blood might play a role in the COVID-19 severity. Taking all this into account, the presented work positions the FO-SPR technology at the forefront of other COVID-19 serological tests, with a huge potential toward other applications in need for quantification and kinetic profiling of antibodies.",

            "text": "Despite the enormous growth of the biosensor field over the past 20 years, 1,2 the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has revealed numerous shortcomings of the current biosensors to deliver rapid diagnostic solutions. However, this pandemic has also pointed to the crucial role of biosensing technologies for measuring antibody responses in patients with previous exposure to severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In addition to evaluating individual and potential community seroprevalence, these so-called serological tests have been proven useful in supporting many other relevant studies, including (1) selection of convalescent plasma donors for COVID-19 therapy, (2) determining the efficacy of newly developed vaccines, (3) further understanding of the immune responses related to protection, and (4) potentially guiding public health interventions. 3, 4 With the global consensus that serological tests play an important role in controlling and managing the COVID-19 pandemic, a plethora of serological test kits have been developed over the past 2 years, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), chemiluminescent immunoassay, and rapid tests. 5\u221210 Despite the fact that some of these have actually reached the market, the majority of the COVID-19 serological tests developed to date offer only partial insight into the patient response by solely focusing on the antibody levels. In this context, surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensors demonstrate clear advantages compared to other platforms because of their capacity for real-time monitoring and label-free detection, which can reveal the binding kinetics of patient antibodies. 11\u221213 The latter has been shown in many studies to be likely related to the severity of COVID-19, further emphasizing the significance of knowing this information rather than just the antibody levels. 14\u221218 Starting from these clear advantages of SPR technology, we present in this work label-free fiber optic (FO)-SPR serological bioassays that enable the measuring of antibody levels as well as kinetic profiling of the polyclonal anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody response in COVID-19 patient samples. In this context, the main benefit of the FO-SPR technology is its compatibility with complex matrices, 19 \u221227 thereby allowing inspection of both antibody levels and their kinetic profiling directly in complex matrices (and hence in patient samples), an aspect difficult to attain with conventional chip-SPR configurations because of the potential clogging of microfluidic channels. Therefore, here we establish the FO-SPR bioassays not only in serum but also for the first time directly in the whole blood of convalescent patients ( Figure 1 ). To accomplish this, the His 6 -tagged receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV-2 viral spike protein is used as the bioreceptor on the FO probe, immobilized with Co(III)-NTA (stands for cobalt(III)-nitrilotriacetic acid) chemistry. This surface chemistry has been selected to achieve an oriented and stable patterning of the bioreceptors, essential for target detection in complex sample matrices. 22 To evaluate the sensitivity of label-free bioassays in serum and whole blood, we also developed FO-SPR sandwich bioassays, traditionally known as more sensitive bioassays. These are established by using two types of detection antibodies: (1) goat anti-human (GAH) IgG or (2) GAH IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody, conjugated with gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to enhance the sensitivity of these bioassays. The GAH IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody is included to increase the likelihood of detecting different antibody isotypes in patient samples (rather than just focusing on IgG as reported in the majority of serological bioassays), thus resembling the label-free bioassay. 28, 29 The FO-SPR sandwich bioassays are benchmarked with an inhouse developed ELISA (using exactly the same bioassay components as on the FO-SPR biosensor) and a commercial ELISA kit (EuroImmun) in a series of COVID-19 convalescent patient samples. Compared to the more frequently reported sandwich bioassays in the context of COVID-19 serological studies, our FO-SPR label-free bioassay offers at least four apparent advantages: (1) information about kinetic binding profiles of antibody responses (not attainable with sandwich bioassays), (2) insight into the complete patient antibody response, (3) shorter time-to-result (i.e., 30 min) compared to sandwich bioassays (e.g., 4 h for a conventional ELISA), and (4) exceptional compatibility with whole blood samples, omitting the need for any sample processing. These innovative aspects, combined with other previously demonstrated FO-SPR attributes, like the low-cost sensor probes, ease of operation, low-demand in sample volume, and even flexibility to integrate with microfluidic platform toward a point-of-care (POC) test, 20 Figure 1 . Schematic illustration of the FO-SPR serological bioassays for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 RBD antibodies in label-free and sandwich formats. The His 6 -tagged RBD was immobilized on the Au-coated FO probe through Co(III)-NTA surface chemistry for an oriented and stable patterning of the bioreceptor. Depicted detection antibody was either GAH IgG or GAH IgG, IgM, and IgA. Table 1 ). Fifteen serum samples, serving as the negative control (NC) in our study, were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic (referred to as N1\u2212N15, COVID-19 negative in Table 1 ). Peripheral blood was collected in BD Vacutainer SST II Advance tubes (Becton, Dickinson and Company, USA) and used to prepare serum that was stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further use. The study protocol (S64089) was approved by the Ethical Committees (EC) of the University Hospitals of Leuven and AZ Groeninge Hospital (Commissie Medische Ethiek) in Kortrijk.",

The details are described in Supporting Information 1.2 and Figure S1B following our previously developed Co(III)-NTAbased bioassays. 22 In the label-free bioassays, the functionalized FO probes were immersed for 30 min in different solutions depending on the type of analysis: (1) the detection buffer (PBST: 10 mM PBS pH 7.4 with 0.01% Tween 20) spiked with the target (i.e., commercial anti-RBD IgG antibody), (2) serum/whole blood from COVID-19 negative samples (diluted with the detection buffer) spiked with the same target, or (3) serum/whole blood both from COVID-19 convalescent patients and COVID-19 negative samples, diluted with the detection buffer. In the sandwich bioassays, the signal amplification was performed after the label-free step, with the FO probes immersed in AuNPs (optical density, OD = 1.0), functionalized with GAH IgG or GAH IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody, for 30 min, as described in the previously developed sandwich bioassays. 22\u221224 Specifically, the serum or whole blood samples were diluted 10-fold for label-free bioassays and 500-fold for sandwich bioassays as will be further elaborated in the following sections.",

Whereas the details can be found in Supporting Information 1.3, in brief, serum samples (minimally 500-fold diluted) and monoclonal anti-RBD antibody were added to plates coated with His 6 -tagged RBD. After 2 h of incubation, the GAH IgG HRP conjugate was incubated for 1 h, followed by addition of the o-phenylenediamine dihydrochloride substrate. After 30 min, the reaction was stopped with H 2 SO 4 (4 M), and absorbance was measured at 492 nm. A commercial anti-SARS-CoV-2 ELISA (Product no. 2606-10, EuroImmun, Lubeck, Germany) for detection of anti-Spike IgG antibodies was performed following the manufacturer's instructions. 37 2.5. Data Analysis. FO-SPR data were collected by FOx software (FOx Biosystems) and further analyzed in Matlab 2019b (The MathWorks Inc., Natick). The detection signals (i.e., SPR shift within the 30 min of association phase) were processed for both label-free and sandwich bioassays. SPR slopes within the first 120 s of the association phase of the label-free binding steps were also extracted by linear regression. The cutoff value was calculated by summing the average and 3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the NC. 38, 39 For the correlation of SPR shift in label-free and sandwich bioassays, the correlation between the obtained SPR shift and slope from the same label-free bioassay, or the correlation between the concentration quantified by the in-house developed ELISA and the commercial kit, the signals were first normalized by dividing each value with the mean of all values for all samples, which could reduce the effect of overlap. 40 To quantify the correlation between the label-free and sandwich bioassays in detecting the total pool of anti-RBD antibodies, Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) were calculated in Matlab. For the ICC analysis, the level of reliability was defined based on the ICC values, which were interpreted as poor (<0.5), moderate (0.5\u22120.75), good (0.75\u22120.9), and excellent (>0.9). 41 One-way analysis of variance and Bonferroni multiple comparison tests were performed in Matlab to identify the statistical differences between the mean values (\u03b1 = 0.05). 42 ",

Initially, we tested different concentrations of His 6 -tagged RBD for the functionalization of the FO probe. Because the NTA-coated surface was saturated in 30 min when applying at least 5 \u03bcg/mL of His 6tagged RBD ( Figure S2 ), this concentration was used throughout the study. Next, to select a suitable serum sample as the NC, we tested 15 serum samples from different patients and 1 commercial HCS, which were all obtained before the COVID-19 pandemic (i.e., February 2017 to February 2020). These samples were diluted 500-fold (to match the best performing dilution for ELISA) and tested by introducing AuNPs functionalized with the GAH IgG antibody but without any spiked anti-RBD antibodies. Although the nonspecific signals from the 15 samples varied from 0.4 to 3.4 nm in SPR shifts (which was probably due to the slight changes in the serum composition and amplified by the functionalized AuNPs used in the sandwich bioassay), their average was comparable to the obtained background signal from the HCS ( Figure S3 ). This allowed us to use the HCS as the single NC throughout the paper as well as the matrix to spike the anti-RBD IgG antibody in the following experiments.",

While this NC showed a minimal to nonexistent shift in buffer, the signal was slightly higher in diluted HCS. This is possibly due to the nonspecific interaction of serum components with the FO probe surface and/or the presence of the antibodies against similar antigens (e.g., originating from seasonal coronavirus strains) in the HCS that have cross-reactivity with SARS-CoV-2 RBD, which might also explain why the overall signal in serum is higher than that in the buffer. Nevertheless, spiking the anti-RBD IgG antibody in either buffer or 10-fold diluted HCS demonstrated significantly higher SPR shifts compared to the NCs, pointing to highly specific detection. It is important to mention that 10-fold dilution of HCS was selected among the other tested serum dilutions (undiluted, 20-, 50-, and 100-fold) because it showed the best performance taking into account both specific and nonspecific signals, while allowing minimal dilution of the sample ( Figure S4 ).",

Before testing 22 COVID-19 patient serum samples with the FO-SPR label-free approach, we first analyzed them using more conventional sandwich bioassays. Here, AuNPs functionalized with the GAH IgG antibody were used to specifically target anti-RBD IgG antibodies for the signal amplification in 500-fold diluted serum samples. As revealed by Figure 3A , the tested samples showed a broad variety of the obtained SPR shifts, reflecting different antibody levels. In order to determine which of these samples can be differentiated from the 500-fold diluted HCS (serving as NC), we calculated the cutoff value based on the NC (for details, see Section 2.5 and summary in Table S1 ). Out of the 22 tested patient samples, only 1 sample (P15) was below the cutoff value. Although we generated the calibration curves for both label-free and sandwich bioassays by spiking the anti-RBD IgG antibody in the buffer ( Figure S5 ), when analyzing patient samples we focused only on the raw signals obtained from the antibody binding (i.e., SPR shifts) rather than their concentrations, similar to majority of the published work related to COVID-19 serological tests. 5\u221210 This was done for two reasons: (1) these calibration curves are established using a single antibody and as such cannot represent different isotypes of antibodies generated in response to a virus that also differ in quantity and ratios among different patients 43\u221245 and (2) knowing the exact concentration of antibodies in COVID-19 patients has not yet been proven as valuable information and requires further investigation from different research disciplines, including clinicians, immunologists, and so forth.",

Therefore, we can conclude that the FO-SPR sandwich bioassay had substantially better performance compared to ELISA in distinguishing the COVID-19 positive samples from the NC. Moreover, the FO-SPR data variability (CV = 4.7 \u00b1 3%, n s = 3) was much smaller than that from ELISA (CV = 13 \u00b1 12.5%, n s = 2), demonstrating a higher reproducibility using FO-SPR. It is important to mention that we also compared this in-house developed ELISA with a commercial ELISA kit (EuroImmun). As shown in Figure S6A , the level of anti-RBD antibodies measured by the in-house ELISA ( Figure S6B ) showed a good correlation (PCC = 0.85, ICC = 0.84) with the titer of anti-S1 IgG antibodies measured by the commercial assay ( Figure  S6C ), similar to previous reports. 48\u221250 3.3. FO-SPR Label-Free Bioassay for Measuring the Antibody Levels and Profiling of Binding Kinetics in Patient Serum Samples. As described in Section 3.1, detection of the commercial anti-RBD IgG antibody using the FO-SPR label-free bioassay was proven feasible in both buffer and 10-fold diluted serum. Therefore, the same 22 COVID-19 patient serum samples, tested with the FO-SPR sandwich bioassay and ELISA, were further assessed in a labelfree manner ( Figure 4A ). All samples were diluted 10-fold, including the HCS used as the NC. Similar to sandwich bioassays, we have applied the cutoff value to evaluate which samples can be distinguished from the NC, with the results summarized in Table S1 . Based on this, only one patient sample (P21) was below the cutoff value. Although this patient sample was a different one compared to the sample below the cutoff value in the FO-SPR sandwich bioassay (P15), they both also showed extremely low OD values in ELISA, suggesting that these patients have very low levels of antibodies, difficult to differentiate from the NC. Nevertheless, we can conclude that the performance of the label-free bioassay was largely comparable if not on par with the sandwich bioassay, the latter traditionally known for its superior sensitivity. This was further verified by the excellent correlation (PCC = 0.98, ICC = 0.96) between the label-free and sandwich bioassays ( Figure 4B) . A similar correlation (PCC = 0.97, ICC = 0.96) was also obtained between FO-SPR label-free and sandwich bioassays performed with GAH IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody, the latter included to resemble labelfree detection of all antibody isotypes (IgG, IgM, and IgA) ( Figure 4C ). Based on the results presented in Figure S7 (i.e., significantly higher level of total antibody pool versus IgG for more than half of the tested patient samples), one might expect that the correlation would have been even better when using GAH IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody. This was however not the case, revealing that IgG remains the predominant isotype in the majority of patients. Nevertheless, we cannot completely rule out that GAH IgG, IgM, and IgA antibody might have different affinity toward different antibody isotypes, which then does not allow to have a true representation of different antibody isotypes in the sample. Contrary to this, a label-free bioassay gives direct insight into the entire antibody pool, being as such of unprecedented value. In this context, it is important to mention that some patient anti-RBD antibodies might form different complexes with other nonspecific antigens or cells from blood samples. Although we cannot completely rule out the interference of these complexes with the performed bioassays, this is also highly unlikely to happen because we acquired highly reproducible label-free and sandwich bioassay data for different tested patient samples, as it can be seen from the provided binding curves ( Figure S8 ), SPR shift, and SPR slope values (Figure 4) .",

Next to the level of antibodies, these slope values are known to reflect the binding rate of the target to the bioreceptor immobilized on the FO probe (i.e., antibodies to the RBD, respectively), thereby giving insight into the kinetic profile of patient antibodies. Although determining the avidity of those antibodies is not trivial to achieve, because of the lack of knowledge on their concentration and ratio of different isotypes, the obtained overall profiles are certainly informative. For instance, strong binding curves were observed for both P2 and P16 in Figure S8 , with a quickly saturated sensing surface and a high final shift. This probably revealed the existence of a dominant binding antibody with high affinity against the immobilized RBD in addition to a high concentration. Contrary to this, a completely distinctive binding profile was observed for P10 and P13, which might suggest that within the same sample, binding of different antibody types and with different affinities occurs over several phases. Furthermore, by comparing the trends of the SPR shift and slope signals in Figure 4A ,D, it is evident that there is no straightforward correlation between the levels of antibodies and their kinetics, which was additionally proven by the poor correlation (PCC = 0.75, ICC = 0.75) between the SPR shift and slope in Figure  S9 . For instance, the SPR shift obtained from sample P2 was only slightly higher than those of P1 and P4, whereas the SPR slope was more than double compared to the other two. This revealed that not all patient serum samples with a high SPR shift inevitably resulted in a high SPR slope and vice versa, probably due to the difference in the overall avidity of the antibodies against RBD in different patient samples. This reflects the biological diversity in antibody repertoire, affinity maturation status, and class switching between individuals for any specific antigen.",

In order to further expand the applicability of the developed label-free FO-SPR bioassay, we also tested it using whole blood samples (10fold diluted) from 14 COVID-19 convalescent patients (Table   ACS Sensors pubs.acs.org/acssensors Article 1). It is important to note that these samples have been collected from a different set of patients compared to those used for collecting serum samples (indicated as the first series in Table 1 ). As the NC, we included the equal mixture of five COVID-19 negative blood samples (BN1, BN3, BN4, BN5, BN6), with the respective signals obtained in label-free and sandwich bioassays shown in Figure S10 . The same 10-fold diluted NC was also used for spiking 8 \u03bcg/mL of the commercial anti-RBD IgG antibody, serving as a positive control to characterize the specificity of the bioassay in blood. The detection of anti-RBD IgG antibody in the diluted blood sample proved to be specific ( Figure S11A ), allowing us to further test patient samples. As summarized in Table S1 and Figure 5A , four samples (BP1, BP5, BP6, and BP7) were below the cutoff value, which could be explained with the fact that certain blood samples were collected from convalescent patients diagnosed with COVID-19 more than a year ago, thereby resulting in the absence of antibodies (or their ",

The excellent correlation between label-free and sandwich bioassays in whole blood was further confirmed by both PCC and ICC using AuNPs conjugated with either GAH IgG (PCC = 0.98, ICC = 0.92) or GAH IgG, IgM, and IgA (PCC = 0.98, ICC = 0.92) antibody ( Figure S12 ), further suggesting that the label-free bioassay had highly comparable performance in detecting patient antibodies. It is important to mention here that, similar to the sandwich bioassay in serum, we used again AuNPs functionalized with either GAH IgG or GAH IgG, IgM and IgA antibody, which did not make a difference (Figures S12 and S13), while the specificity of the sandwich bioassay in whole blood was proven by spiking the 500-fold diluted NC with the commercial anti-RBD IgG antibody ( Figure S11B ). Next, we wanted to test whether the sensitivity of the labelfree bioassay could be additionally improved by using undiluted blood samples. Here, we selected the seven samples with the lowest SPR shift (BP1, BP2, BP5, BP6, BP7, BP8, and BP13) from Figure 5A . As it can be seen from Figure 5C , reducing the dilution factor of blood samples allowed one additional sample (BP1) to be distinguished from the NC based on the cutoff value (Table S1 ). This has also demonstrated the remarkable feasibility of the FO-SPR platform to deliver highly sensitive label-free bioassays in undiluted blood samples, which could tremendously simplify the sample preparation and be of great significance toward developing true POC biosensors.",

Similar to the binding curves as observed in Figure S8 and elaborated in Section 3.3, the binding profiles were quite different among different patient samples with some showing dominant binding antibodies (e.g., BP3/SP3 and BP4/SP4) and others revealing more binding phases (e.g., BP10/SP10, BP11/SP11, and BP14/SP14).

Based on the statistical analysis of 22 COVID-19 patient serum samples (500-fold dilution), the FO-SPR sandwich bioassay showed substantially better performance compared to ELISA in distinguishing the COVID-19 positive samples from the NC. This superior FO-SPR performance was maintained even when testing the same samples (10-fold dilution) using the label-free format while offering a significantly shorter TTR (30 min) compared to the sandwich bioassay (TTR: 67 min) and the inhouse developed ELISA (TTR: 4 h). Most importantly, the label-free bioassay also revealed the binding kinetic profiles of polyclonal antibodies against the immobilized RBD, which is not possible to achieve with any of the sandwich bioassays. This additional information provides valuable input for clinical studies as it has been reported that the antibody-binding kinetics against the antigen in patient blood could be associated with the COVID-19 severity. 14\u221217 Our data further supported these observations by revealing that there was no direct correlation between antibody levels and their kinetics, which reflects the biological diversity in antibody repertoire, affinity maturation status, and class switching between individuals for any specific antigen.",

Based on the statistical analysis, the FO-SPR label-free bioassay was highly comparable to the sandwich bioassay in its capacity to discriminate the samples from the NC. Interestingly, this was even further improved by performing the label-free bioassays in undiluted blood samples. This not only demonstrated the feasibility of performing the FO-SPR bioassay in a matrix as complex as undiluted whole blood, resulting from the oriented and stable immobilization of His 6 -tagged bioreceptors using Co(III)-NTA chemistry, but also pushed the FO-SPR technology one-step further to developing true POC biosensors without the need for sample pretreatment or dilutions. Additionally, we also proved the independency of the FO-SPR technology from the sample matrix by label-free detection of the patient serum samples ACS Sensors pubs.acs.org/acssensors Article collected from the same donors as the whole blood, which resulted in similar detection. Moreover, we were able to obtain the antibody kinetics profiling in whole blood samples as well, which, similar to the serum samples, revealed poor correlation with the antibody levels.",
