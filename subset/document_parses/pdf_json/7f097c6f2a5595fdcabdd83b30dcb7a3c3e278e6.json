The data sample for the study includes responses from 461 hospitality students from various institutes in India. Our findings reveal that all the four-point of interactions, content, instructors, peers, and technology, have a significant positive impact on perceived learning. Further, learners' interaction with the content was emerged as the most significant predictor of perceived learning. The data was put to moderation analysis, with results suggesting that self-efficacy has a conditional effect only on the interaction between content and perceived learning.",

Due to this, effective communication between the staff, students, and other stakeholders remained a challenge even though nearly 91% of the HEIs surveyed had the infrastructure for communication. Then, there were some other challenges that these institutes faced, such as access to technical infrastructure, competencies and pedagogies for online learning, and the resources to support specific fields of study. Given that hospitality and tourism education focuses more on experiential learning and on-the-job training, educators need to understand the factors that affect the learners' perceived learning experience in ERT. As emphasized by many academicians, the ultimate purpose of hospitality and tourism education is to provide professionally trained talents to the industry (Liburd et al., 2018; Lo, 2012) .",

            "text": "While, online learning platform enables flexibility in teaching and learning, the abrupt shift from the traditional to the online, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, has resulted in a Transactional Distance (TD) between the instructor and learner. The Theory of Transactional Distance (TTD) defines TD as \"the psychological or communicative space that separates instructor from the learner in the transaction between them, occurring in the structured or planned learning situation\" (Moore, 1993, p. 1) . This theory is the first of its kind pedagogical theory that bases its analysis on online learning and teaching rather than the classroom. According to this theory, learner can lead to a communication gap. A communication gap like this may further lead to instructor and learner misapprehensions (Moore, 1993) . This notion has found support from Giossos et al. (2009) in their review of the relevance of Moore's Theory in contemporary settings. Moore also opined that the transaction between the instructor and learner comprises three factors: Dialog, structure, and autonomy. While dialog refers to two-way communication that ultimately helps solve the learners' problem (Giossos et al., 2009) , structure refers to the nature of the level of rigidity or simplicity of the courses. The factor autonomy depends on the dialog and structure and refers to the learner's independence and interdependence as they engage in the learning. Though this theory's validity is not accepted unanimously (Gorsky & Caspi, 2005) , generally, there is conformity regarding its usefulness as a theoretical framework in a distance learning environment such as ERT (Best & Concei\u00e7\u00e3o, 2018; Gavrilis, Mavroidis, & Giossos, 2020; Goel, Zhang, & Templeton, 2012; Kara, 2020; Weidlich & Bastiaens, 2018) . Meanwhile, TD is believed to increase when there is greater learner autonomy, more structure, and less dialog (Ekwunife-Orakwue & Teng, 2014) . Moore (1993) opined that a positive interaction between learners, teachers, and peers enhances the learner's understanding and engagement with the courses. Specifically, he suggests that \"one of the major determinants of the extent to which TD will be overcome is whether the interaction between learners and instructors is possible, and the extent to which it is achieved\" (p. 26). It is argued that increased interaction is likely to reduce the TD. Specifically, in a complete online learning environment such as ERT, this interaction is likely to either impede or foster based on other factors, such as technology-based communication, the course structure, and responsiveness of instructors/learners (Smith et al., 2000) . Thus, an effective interaction plays a crucial role in the success of the teaching and learning experience in a complete online learning environment. It, therefore, becomes imperative to investigate this dimension from the learner's perceived learning and satisfaction point of view. Additionally, interaction is a key dimension in fostering, supporting, and engaging learners (Anderson, 2003) in the online learning environment (Moore & Kearsley, 1996) and bridging the physical separation between instructor and the learner. Going further, Moore (1993) identifies three types of interactions: (a) learner-learner, (b) learner-instructor and, (c) learner-content. understand the teacher's requirements better and are sometimes an integral part of an assignment. Moore (1989, p. 3) defines this interaction as \"the interaction between one learner and other learners, alone or in group settings, with or without the real-time presence of an instructor\". They describe the LLI as a \"two-way reciprocal communication between or among learners who exchange information, knowledge, thoughts, or ideas regarding course content, with or without the presence of an instructor.\" Many researchers in the past have investigated this interaction and its relationship with the perceived learning experience. For example, Kassandrinou et al. (2018) exclusively examined the LLI and its impact on perceived learning. The findings of their semi-structured interviews with 12 postgraduate students revealed that LLI negatively impacted perceived learning. However, contrary to this, a study conducted by Lewis (2011) found LLI was a significant predictor of perceived learning. This finding was further supported by the research conducted by Ekwunife-Orakwue and Teng (2014). Considering the above, we propose the following hypothesis. Hypothesis 1. LLI has a positive impact on learner's perceived learning.",

It is considered the most valuable interaction in distance learning environments (Moore, 1989, p. 103) . Learners need guidance from their teachers to determine whether they have understood the content material correctly, how particular content needs to be studied, and how they need to discuss the content. Irrespective of whether or not they are physically present, instructors have a crucial role in supporting learning. Thus, LII is the most researched component of transactional distance (Kanini Mbwesa, 2014) . Ekwunife-Orakwue and Teng (2014) found that LII has a significant role in perceived learning outcomes. This notion found further support from other researchers (Fredericksen et al., 2000; Jiang & Ting, 2000; Kang & Im, 2013) . Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis.",

It is an internal debate that takes place in the mind of the learner. The learners engage in a dialog with the learning content asking themselves about the new thing they have learnt, agree with, or still lack. In the absence of the instructor, content necessitates a high degree of self-direction on the part of the learner (Elyakim et al., 2019) . This step can best be described as an interaction between the learner and the subject under study. Moore (1989, p. 3) describe the LCI as \"involving a process of individual learners elaborating and reflecting on the subject matter or the course content\". These authors also note that unlike LII or LLI, only the learner is directly involved in LCI. Though Moore (1993) has not elaborated on LCI, it is worth mentioning that (Huang et al., 2015) described it as a structural rather than a dialogic factor of TD. While investigating the impact of TD on learner's perceived learning in an online and blended environment, Ekwunife-Orakwue and Teng (2014) found that LCI has a larger impact on learning outcomes than any other type of dialog. This notion was further echoed by Sebastianelli et al. (2015) , who suggests that LCI is a significant predictor of learners' perceived learning. A more recent study conducted in India during the COVID-19 pandemic also suggests that LCI has a significant positive impact on perceived learning and learners' satisfaction (Kumar et al., 2021) . Therefore, we propose the following hypothesis.",

This fourth dimension emerges when learners interact with the technological interface that was not theorized earlier (Gunawardena & Gunawardena, 1999; Hillman et al., 1994) . In an online learning context, the role of LTI remains inconclusive though there are studies that find that it interacts with specific learner's factors (Roblyer & Wiencke, 2003) . For instance, Strachota (2003) finds that the impact of LTI on learners' satisfaction is negligible (only 9%). However, other studies state that LTI is not the sole predictor of learning outcomes. Specific learners' factors interact with LTI to impact the learner's perceived learning, such as prior computer training (Dupin-Bryant, 2004) and learner's self-confidence (Menlove & Lignugaris/Kraft, 2004) . Based on these, we propose the following hypothesis.",

The students undergoing bachelor's or master's degrees in hotel management, hospitality, and tourism, culinary arts were included. Data were collected using an online survey instrument between the period Nov 27, 2020 to Feb 20, 2021. Initially, all institutes offering the hospitality and tourism programs were listed. Later, the authors used their personal contacts to approach instructors from these institutes and request them to distribute the survey instrument to respondents. Finally, a total of 12 institutes participated in the survey with respondents' distribution as follows: Andhra Pradesh (25), Bihar (24), Chandigarh (26), Delhi (28), Gujarat (27), Rajasthan (15), Karnataka (118), Kerala (33), Maharashtra (47), Tamil Nadu (27), Uttar Pradesh (34), and West-Bengal (57). This study adopted the convenience sampling technique to collate and analyze data. The key advantages of convenience sampling are that it is simple, cheap, efficient, and easy to implement. Additionally, it is found that when the population is homogeneous (for example, students as respondents), the adoption of the convenience sampling method is common because it offers narrower but clearer generalizability (Jager et al., 2017) . A survey instrument was forwarded to 1262 students. The total number of responses was 461 resulting in 36.5% of the response rate. The sample consisted of 330 (71.6%) male and 131 (28.4%) female respondents. This vast difference in the male and female ratio could be attributed to more enrollments from male aspirants than females. According to a recent report (Minsitry of Education, 2021), the total number of enrollment of male students in hospitality and tourism programs (for undergraduates) is 12630 as against females (3378). The ratio is 4:1. However, there is a slight improvement regarding enrollment for the postgraduate program (512 males and 303 females). In terms of age, most respondents, 346 (75%), were aged between 18 and 21. The remaining 116 (25%) were above 21 years. The average age of the respondents was 20.9 years (SD = 2.8). Considering the educational level, most respondents were Bachelor in Hotel Management (four years) 278 (60.3%).

The interaction with course content comprised of four items (\u03b1 = 0.848), interaction with an instructor having six items (\u03b1 = 0.876), and interaction with peers consisting of eight items (\u03b1 = 0.910) and these were measured using items adapted from the study by (Y.

The construct perceived learning was measured using six items (\u03b1 = 0.945) adapted from the study (Hiltz, 1994 ). The learner's self-efficacy was measured using an eight-item scale (\u03b1 = 0.973) adapted from the study (Shen et al., 2013) . The learners were asked to rate their agreement or disagreement with statements on a five-point Likert scale and their self-efficacy on a five-point rating scale where \"1 \u2032\u2032 and \"5 \u2032\u2032 indicated least and most confidence, respectively. The outcome variable, i.e., learning experience, was measured using a five-point Likert scale.

Further, five hypotheses assessing the direct effect of interaction on perceived learning were measured using structural equation modeling. The standardized path coefficients and t-values suggest that the four out of five hypotheses proposed in the model were supported (Table 2 ). Hypothesis 1, which considered the influence of leaner-learner interaction on perceived learning, was supported (\u03b2 = 0.144, p < 0.01).

Furthermore, the plot of the conditional effect between learner-content interaction and perceived learning showed that the effect was higher for students with low self-efficacy than those with higher SE (Fig. 2) . SEClass = 1 stands for low SE (blue line) and SEClass = 2 (green line) stands for high SE. As can be seen from the graph, there is a difference in the y-intercept, which suggests no rating for LCI (i.e., low rating for the content provided). Students with high SE find an edge over those with low SE. However, students with low SE heavily depend on the content and show greater appreciation for it, which further impacts their perceived learning. Hence the relationship is stronger when learners with low SE are dependent upon and interact with the content. On the other hand, students with high SE tend to learn less from the content and more from other interactions. While they also appreciate the content, however, the overall impact on their perceived learning is lesser than those who have low SE.",

This finding is in line existing studies in literature (Alqurashi, 2019; Ekwunife-Orakwue & Teng, 2014; Y. C. Kuo et al., 2014; Sebastianelli et al., 2015) . According to the reintegration of the teaching and learning acts (Keegan, 1996) , the instructional materials should help the learner reconstruct the LII in a different timeframe. In other words, the learning materials should be designed to help the learner have an internal dialog with the instructor. Further, Holmberg (1989) describes this as a guided didactic conversation between the learner and instructor in the course content. The LCI is often thought to be a distinguishing feature of education. It is the process of intellectually engaging with material that improves the learner's comprehension, perspective, or cognitive constructs in their minds. (Moore, 1989, p. 2) . Moore further insists that without LCI, there cannot be education (p. 2), a view which finds support in Anderson N.B. Prabhu M et al. (2003) , who opined that interaction between the learner and content is a crucial component of both campus-based and distance education. This notion was further supported by many researchers later (Goh et al., 2019; Kumar et al., 2021; Zhang & Lin, 2020) . Further (Bervell et al., 2020) , reveal that LLI and LII are both predicted by LCI. In other words, the instructor's online content is a significant promoter of LLI and LII. Additionally, during an empirical study conducted by Terumi & Anderson (2010) , participants were asked to rank their preferred interaction type. Interestingly, they ranked LCI the highest, followed by LLI and LII. This result reveals a shift in perspective from instructor-centered learning to a content-centered approach to learning. Therefore, hospitality educators can use this insight while designing course content such as interactive texts, videos, and computer-based multimedia for better learning outcomes in an online learning environment such as ERT.",

Though LII may not be a defining feature of online education, a study by (Rhode, 2009) shows that learners equally value the LCI and LII. Thus, hospitality educators need to increase the LII during online teaching by providing timely feedback and immediacy. The communication research offers ample evidence for the positive impact of instant messages (Kuyath et al., 2013) and feedback (Vlachopoulos & Makri, 2019) on LII during online learning.

This is the first study investigating the impact of interactions on learners' perceived learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the majority of studies have investigated three types of interaction (content, instructor, and peer), our study integrates the fourth interaction (LTI) to the model of Interaction proposed by Moore (1993) . According to this theory, in online education, a physical distance of a learner from instructor, peer, and content may lead to a communication gap, leading to apprehensions amongst them. Though this theory is not accepted unanimously (Gorsky & Caspi, 2005) , its usefulness in distance learning is confirmed (Goel et al., 2012) . In that light, our findings demonstrate that interactions (including LTI) positively impact perceived learning (H1 to H4) and provide empirical evidence for the usefulness of the theory in distance/online education.",

Further, the adoption of ICT-based technologies has evolved the whole teaching-learning from teacher-centric to learner-centric. Following this, using technology is one of the critical factors for both the instructor and the learner in ensuring a learner-centric environment. Therefore, understanding the learners' interaction with the technology interface and its impact on their perceived learning becomes crucial for educators and academicians.

The findings have important implications for hospitality educators who can use them to design more interactive, engaging, and immersive online learning experiences.

Learning materials in the form of multimedia, lectures, and handouts can greatly improve learning outcomes. Further, by adding challenging tasks, instructors can significantly improve learners' interaction with the content. This can be achieved by adding simulations, case studies, and web searches that demand learners' interaction with the content.

The perceived learning of learners with low SE is likely more related to LCI. Therefore, the finding suggests that SE is a moderator variable between LCI and PL. Therefore, hospitality educators need to focus on four areas accepted as the core elements in SE's development (Bandura, 1978) : Enactive Mastery Experiences, Vicarious Experience, Verbal Persuasion, and the Physiological Affective States. While enactive mastery refers to the learner's successful learning experience in the past, vicarious experience refers to observing a role model perform a task successfully. Further, verbal persuasion involves one person convincing the other that they can perform a task successfully. Finally, physiological and affective states refer to stress, emotion, mood, pain, and fatigue, highlighting the need to focus on technology and course content. Further, the learning strategies (Keller, 1987) would be useful for enhancing the SE. For example, hospitality instructors can guide learners on developing a work plan, offering rewards and recognitions, motivating feedback, and setting realistic goals.",

They may also explore other outcome variables, such as learners' satisfaction. Further, the data for this study is collected based on convenience sampling techniques. Future studies may employ other sampling techniques such as stratified sampling. One of the important limitations of the study is the gender ratio of the participants. In this study, nearly three fourth of the respondents were males. Therefore, this might have impacted the interaction effect of SE between interaction and perceived learning. It is believed that gender impact varies substantially at different ages across different study contexts. Therefore, future studies should consider other moderating variables such as age, gender, course to investigate the conditional effect on the outcome variable(s).",
