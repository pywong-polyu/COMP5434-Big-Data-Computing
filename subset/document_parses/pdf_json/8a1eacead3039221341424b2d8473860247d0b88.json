A pertinent and recent example where such a strategy could be employed is in the fight against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Therapies designed or discovered to target viral proteins also have off-target effects on the host proteome when employed in a complex physiological environment. This study aims to assess these host cell targets for a panel of FDA-approved antiviral compounds including remdesivir, using the cellular thermal shift assay (CETSA) coupled with mass spectrometry (CETSA MS) in noninfected cells. CETSA MS is a powerful method to delineate direct and indirect interactions between small molecules and protein targets in intact cells. Biologically active compounds can induce changes in thermal stability, in their primary binding partners, and in proteins that in turn interact with the direct targets. Such engagement of host targets by antiviral drugs may contribute to the clinical effect against the virus but can also constitute a liability. We present here a comparative study of CETSA molecular target engagement fingerprints of antiviral drugs to better understand the link between off-targets and efficacy.",

            "text": "The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seen a significant worldwide effort to reuse or repurpose preexisting therapies in order to combat the emerging viral threat. There have been numerous studies reported using a variety of technologies in an effort to screen panels of prevalidated molecules, many repurposed from viral therapies. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] These studies are conducted in the hope that efficacy against the SARS-CoV-2 virus may be discovered, while avoiding the lengthy yet essential drug discovery pipeline that even with modern standards typically takes several years from hit and target identification to reach clinical testing of a lead candidate drug molecule. 6 Utilising a preexisting molecule has a significantly lower risk than rapidly developing novel chemistry, since it has already successfully navigated the prerequisite safety and toxicologic testing for use in humans. However, the original purpose of the small molecule may have undescribed offtarget effects that are deemed to be tolerable when weighed against therapeutic benefit. These effects, potentially caused by drug-protein interactions, are often poorly understood. 7 For example, many antiviral compounds are structural analogs of nucleoside triphosphates that have diverse biological properties and therapeutic consequences since nucleotides have an essential role in virtually all biological processes. 8 Therefore, given the abundance of nucleotide interacting proteins in the host cell, off-target interacting proteins, or an imbalance of the cellular nucleotide pool, would be an expected consequence of utilizing nucleotide analogs in therapy. 9 The persistent and fundamental problem of host off-target effects arises from using a molecule to disrupt viral biology, while simultaneously exposing the host biology to the same chemical challenge. Methods to describe the severity of hitting off targets rely upon in vitro and in vivo assessment or the presentation of a phenotype that can be assessed as to whether it is acceptable or not. However, this requires knowledge and the ability to measure nonintended target biology. For example, remdesivir is known to have an efficacy of 100 nM (IC 50 ) for the viral polymerase, its intended target, and is 500-fold less efficacious against human polymerases. 10 It has previously not been established which other proteins it may interact with and or whether these potential interactions would elicit a response with a measurable output using conventional means.",

The method is increasingly being employed both in mechanism of action (MoA) studies and to identify primary and off-targets of candidate drug molecules, for example, quinine and drug target interactions in Plasmodium falciparum. 14, 15 In this study, we screened a panel of drugs using the CETSA MS format on HepG2 cells to identify host proteins as hopeful starting points for further research and possible inroads into the improvement or development of fortuitous therapies for SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

In this light, there are other targets involved in nucleotide regulation, such as RNR, SAMHD1, and ADK in particular, that we would have expected the cellular presence of GS-441524 and other nucleotide analogs to have affected. In contrast, these regulatory proteins were not identified as hits, which is a surprising outcome given that, in our experience, ADK is known to shift upon binding of a substrate.",

            "text": "The function of TRIP13 does not lend itself to being an obvious benefit or hinderance to viral infection, as would be considered by a protein with known host innate viral immunity activity. But the fact that it interacts with nucleotides and forms a homohexamer that, if diminished, removes activity gives credence to the possibility that interaction with remdesivir may in fact be tangible. 30 It is distinctly clear (Fig. 3) that the T m value of TRIP13 in lysate is substantially lower than that of intact cells; this is likely due to the bulk dilution effect of lysing cells into a buffered solution. Nucleotides, metabolites, and proteins that could form homo-or heterocomplexes are substantially diluted. Given that the biology of the target involves the formation of higher-order complexes, this difference in T m could be attributed to the disruption of these complexes combined with the dilution of ATP after lysis. Interestingly, unlike the intact sample, the lysate sample has no apparent shift after the incubation with remdesivir. Even though the incubation step is shorter and at a lower temperature in the lysate sample, we proffer that remdesivir itself has not been converted to its active form by proteins that were hits in the intact MS CETSA experiments, such as CES2. While these proteins, essential for the activation of remdesivir, are likely present in the lysate sample, the concentration would be significantly reduced. A useful study would be to test other forms of remdesivir to elucidate whether the active form of the drug or one of the several activation steps are responsible for the TRIP13 destabilizing activity.",

The functional relevance of such an interaction in the context of virus-infected tissue could yield crucial information as to whether its potential off-target behavior is tolerable, beneficial, or indeed a hindrance to the molecule's efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. Also, remdesivir may constitute a starting point for developing antitumor therapies directed against TRIP13.
