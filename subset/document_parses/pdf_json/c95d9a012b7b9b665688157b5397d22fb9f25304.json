            "text": "Aims/Introduction: After the first coronavirus disease 2019 state of emergency announcement, there was an increase in stress that might have affected the selfmanagement of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. This study identified the changes in clinical findings and stress among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and investigated the characteristics of patients who experienced an increase in blood pressure (BP) after the announcement. Materials and Methods: Retrospectively, we scrutinized 310 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who were treated by the Sagamihara Physicians Association. After the announcement, 164 and 146 patients showed an increase (\u0394BP >0 group) and decrease in BP (\u0394BP \u22640 group), respectively. The propensity score matching method was used to compare the differences in clinical findings and stress-related questionnaire responses between the two groups. Results: After the announcement, 47% of patients experienced an increase in daily stress. Furthermore, 17% and 36% reported worsening dietary intake and a decrease in exercise, respectively. More patients reported that their dietary and salt intake had worsened in the \u0394BP >0 group than in the \u0394BP \u22640 group (9% vs 20%, P = 0.02, and 3% vs 10%, P = 0.04, respectively). Additionally, both systolic and diastolic BP measured in the office were significantly increased (P = 0.02 and P = 0.03, respectively); however, systolic BP measured at home significantly decreased (P = 0.01). The total stress scores were higher in the \u0394BP >0 group than in the \u0394BP \u22640 group (0.05 -2.61 and 0.93 -2.70, respectively, P = 0.03). Conclusions: An increase in stress and, particularly, worsening dietary and salt intake were noted among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who experienced an increase in BP after the state of emergency announcement.",

Japan is located in an area where natural disasters, such as typhoons, earthquakes or heavy rains, often occur, and these disasters increase stress and lead to cardiovascular complications among the people in Japan [1] [2] [3] . Although the COVID-19 pandemic differed from conventional natural disasters, it is thought that the state of emergency caused increased stress among the people in Japan. We previously reported an increase in blood pressure (BP) after the state of emergency announcement among outpatients who visited clinics in Japan 4 . We also reported that the increase in BP was related to worsening dietary intake.",

In a survey carried out in the USA, one-third of the patients had worsening dietary intake, and half experienced a decrease in exercise 6 . The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted both diet and exercise interventions, and became an indirect risk for patients with diabetes mellitus. Furthermore, it has previously been reported that having to maintain social distancing to reduce person-to-person contact might increase the incidence of anxiety and depression, which could lead to poor medication adherence 7 . Patients with diabetes mellitus are considered at increased risk for not only common infections, but also more severe COVID-19 infections [8] [9] [10] . This further emphasizes the increased stress among patients with diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, the stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the subsequent state of emergency was likely a major concern among patients with diabetes mellitus. Several retrospective studies reported the relationship between the stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and the level of hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) or bodyweight (BW) in Japanese patients with diabetes mellitus [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Appropriate BP control is also important in the management of patients with diabetes mellitus; however, only one study carried out by Endo et al. 19 reported the relationship between stress, dietary intake or exercise and systolic BP and HbA 1c in Japanese patients with diabetes mellitus under the state of emergency. Their study was retrospectively carried out at a single center, and other clinical data, including BW, were lacking. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the changes in clinical findings, including BP, HbA 1c and BW, and stress among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and investigate the characteristics of patients who experienced an increase in BP after the state of emergency announcement.",

In this subanalysis, we included patients with: (i) type 2 diabetes mellitus; (ii) clinical findings for sex, age, BW, diastolic BP (DBP), systolic BP (SBP), HbA 1c levels, serum creatinine levels, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and urinary protein levels (urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio [ACR] or qualitative proteinuria) collected both before and after the state of emergency; and (iii) data on the use of concomitant agents (antihypertensive agents, hypoglycemic agents, statins, ezetimibe and antiplatelet agents). Based on these inclusion criteria, 310 out of 748 patients were included in the present study.",

Tanaka et al. 13 reported the different processes for the increase in BW and the reduced glycemic control depending on age under the state of emergency. With respect to prevention against the worsening of glycemic control, improving inappropriate dietary behavior 12 or seeking telemedicine or regular clinic visits during the state of emergency was suspected 26 . In contrast, significant worsening of glycemic control was not observed in patients with diabetes mellitus after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic 18, 27, 28 . Among these studies, Masuda et al. 18 reported that HbA 1c levels significantly decreased in the unstressed group, whereas Terakawa et al. 28 suggested a relationship between the worsening of glycemic control and living and working environments. Final conclusions for the change in HbA 1c during the COVID-19 pandemic could not be drawn from these retrospective studies, including the present study. Nevertheless, the most important thing that general practitioners should be aware of is that the worsening of physical activity, mental stress and inappropriate dietary intake can induce worsening of glycemic control and an increase in BW in patients with diabetes mellitus. Endo et al. 19 reported increases in BP after the announcement of the COVID-19 pandemic. BP control is also important in the management of diabetes mellitus, and its worsening can be one of the most serious concerns among patients with diabetes mellitus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Endo et al. 19 reported that the COVID-19 pandemic worsened the glycemic and BP control, even in patients who perceived no marked change in their diet or exercise. The present study showed a significant increase in office BP among patients with diabetes mellitus after the state of emergency announcement, without significant changes in HbA 1c or BW. Furthermore, the PS-matched model showed a significant relationship between worsening dietary and salt intake and an increase in BP after the state-of-emergency announcement. Additionally, patients with diabetes mellitus who experienced an increase in BP had higher total stress scores. Previous retrospective studies reported imbalanced characteristics of patients, and were unable to consider the effects of confounding factors. Although a randomized control study is the most reliable research method, it is practically impossible to carry one out during the COVID-19 pandemic. The present study is the only one that utilized a PS-matching method to balance the characteristics of the patients in each group, and we believe that the results of the analysis with reduced bias have great significance.",

Kario et al. 1 reported that the BP profiles of three patients changed from white coat hypertension to sustained hypertension, and that there was an increase in cardiovascular events immediately after the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake 2 . Furthermore, the Great East Japan Earthquake was noted to influence early morning homebased BP management among patients who did not live near the epicenter of the earthquake 3 . Fath et al. 29 reported a transient increase in BP after just 1-2 weeks after the earthquake, and a return to original BP levels more than 1 month after the earthquake. Mechanical (e.g., cold, noise and radiation), biological (e.g., inflammation, infection and hunger), chemical (e.g., air pollution and drugs) and psychological (e.g., sadness, anger and anxiety) factors can induce stress. In relation to one another, these factors contribute to total stress after natural disasters. However, sometimes after such disasters, the stress becomes psychological stress 30 . Furthermore, our previous study showed a significant decrease in BP at home and a significant increase in office BP, which caused an increase in white coat hypertension among patients who regularly visited general practitioners 4 . Here, worsening dietary and salt intake, and higher total stress scores among patients with diabetes mellitus were more prevalent in the \u0394BP \u22650 group than in the \u0394BP <0 group, suggesting that increased stress influenced their dietary and salt intake. Elevated BP in the office was also noted. Thus, BW management and salt restrictions should be considered in stressful situations involving disasters.",

Additionally, a higher mortality rate has been reported among patients with diabetes mellitus with poor glycemic control 32 . Several reports have shown a relationship between disasters and glycemic control among patients with diabetes mellitus in Japan. Inui et al. 33 reported that plasma glucose levels in patients with diabetes mellitus were elevated for a maximum of 3 months after the Hanshin-Awaji earthquake in Kobe City, which was the epicenter of the earthquake. However, no elevation in plasma glucose levels was noted in a neighboring city (Osaka City) 33 . In their study, the General Health Questionnaire scores, which were used to investigate the state of psychological distress or altered behavior related to the earthquake, were higher among patients with diabetes mellitus in Kobe City than in Osaka City 33 . Furthermore, high HbA 1c levels and General Health Questionnaire scores among patients with diabetes mellitus were related to the destruction of their houses or the death of close relatives 33 .",

            "text": "We suspected some reasons for the significant decrease in BP at home during the state of emergency. First, the season changed from winter to spring, and BP tended to be lower as the temperature increased. Second, the present study was an observational study with no restrictions on the change in treatment; general practitioners might have added antihypertensive medications to achieve the target BP. According to our previous report, the target BP achievement rate improved from 18% (from April to June in 2019) to 31% during the state of emergency 4 ; thus, the second reason seems more likely. Wojciechowska et al. 39 reported that aircraft noise reduction during the lockdown was associated with a decrease in BP. This suggests that a reduction in daily social stress might lower BP, even during lockdown. Considering that the COVID-19 pandemic has a varied impact on people, understanding the various stresses among people is important to evaluate the changes in BP. In Japan, patients felt much stress outside and always wore masks for fear of acquiring the COVID-19 infection. Such stress had an immediate influence on the sympathetic system, and the office BP increased during the state of emergency. With respect to \u0394HbA 1c , the short observation periods might be related. As for \u0394BW, multiple linear regression analysis showed that worsening dietary intake was an independent factor for \u0394BW, with coefficient values of 0.23 (95% CI 0.09-0.97; P = 0.02). After the state of emergency, BW was greater in the \u0394BP >0 group than in the \u0394BP \u22640 group (64.6 -13.0 vs 64.1 -11.7, respectively), and a significant difference might be observed in a large-scale survey.",

In addition, Kamimura et al. 42 reported that HbA 1c levels were elevated at 1-2 months after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011, and that elevated HbA 1c levels were related to psychological stress not only in shelters, but also in patients' own homes. An increase in cortisol or catecholamine secretion 43 , sleep disruption and circadian misalignment 44 were thought to be the mechanisms underlying the worsening of glycemic control after disasters, which caused stress or anxiety among patients. Interestingly, glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus unexpectedly worsened at 1-2 months after the Kumamoto earthquake in 2016, and this decrease was negatively correlated with the prompt recovery of lifelines and a sufficient amount of sleep, which might contribute to emotional stability 45 .",
