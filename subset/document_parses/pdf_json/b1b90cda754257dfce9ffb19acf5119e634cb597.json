During lockdown, all scheduled appointments except for treatments under general anesthesia and deep sedation were canceled due to the government's restrictions; the frequency of treatments with non-pharmacological behavior management, general anesthesia or deep sedation was higher than in the previous or subsequent periods and the use of inhaled/conscious sedation was significantly lower. During lockdown most of the children were diagnosed with dentoalveolar abscess (32.3%), compared to 14 and 21% at the previous or subsequent periods, respectively (P < 0.001). Treatments combination during lockdown included more extractions, pulpectomies and pulp extirpation and less permanent restorations (P < 0.001). None of the staff members was infected with COVID-19 at the clinic during these periods. We concluded that dentists should be updated about Covid-19 modes of transmission and the recommended infection control measures in dental settings. Effective management protocols can help the dental staff to continue to provide efficient treatment and prevent Covid-19 contamination.",

Avoidance of routine dental treatment may lead to deterioration in oral health and increase in dental infections, caries, neglect of dental trauma and periodontal disease. Similar to our findings, Guo et al. reported 38% decrease in the number of patients visiting the dental emergency clinic in Beijing, China at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic (13) . Tobias et al. reported a decrease in dental emergency treatment in the period between March 17th to April 30th, 2020 in a public health system in Israel (14) . The fact that in our clinics none of the staff members and the patients was infected with COVID-19 during the three periods studied is encouraging.

Restless, crying children spread more aerosol compared to calm children, so appropriate and skillful behavior management is the first and most important basic technique to minimize the probability of SARS-CoV-2 cross-infection. Dental care to children involves various methods for behavior management, including inhaled or conscious sedation, which were a subject of controversy during COVID-19 outbreak; for example, Simpson et al. (15) avoided inhalation sedation due to difficulties disinfecting the reusable nasal hoods and tubing. This led them to use non-pharmacologic behavior management techniques which they reported effective in over a third of patients who needed extraction and trauma management under local anesthesia (15) . We have used a higher rate of non-pharmacologic behavior management during lockdown compared with the other periods, as less patients were treated with nitrous oxide (either exclusively or combined with oral sedative) at lockdown. The fact that no case of cross-infection of patients or staff was reported at our department suggests that the use the nitrous oxide is safe if managed and sterilized as instructed by the manufactures.",
