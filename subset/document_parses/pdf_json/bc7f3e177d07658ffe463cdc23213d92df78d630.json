We conducted a retrospective cohort study to further explore the prognostic value of serum hypoalbuminemia and other factors in hospitalized COVID-19 patients. e primary endpoint was defined as the risk of in-hospital mortality. 300 patients were included in the analysis, with 56% being male and a mean (\u00b1SD) age of 61.5 \u00b1 15.3 years. e mean (\u00b1SD) albumin was 2.86 \u00b1 0.5 g/dL. Our analysis showed that patients with in-hospital mortality had lower albumin levels than patients without in-hospital mortality (2.6 \u00b1 0.49 vs. 2.9 \u00b1 0.48 g/dL, respectively, with P value \ufffd <0.001). A multivariant logistic regression analysis was subsequently conducted, and after adjustment, the serum albumin level remained a strong predictor of the primary outcome. Based on the data gathered, we were able to create a model predictive of mortality in this patient group based on the serum albumin level and other pertinent factors. In this model, with all other variables remaining constant, each one-unit increase in albumin is estimated to reduce the odds of mortality by 73%. Our results strengthen the current available data on the prognostic value of serum albumin in COVID-19 patients and provide a model to predict in-hospital mortality.",

            "text": "In December 2019, SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2) was first identified after a cluster of viral pneumonia cases were detected in Wuhan (Hubei province, China). e virus has rapidly spread across the globe to be characterized a world-wide pandemic by the WHO on March 11, 2020. As of December 5, 2020, there have been over 66 million reported cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally and over 1.5 million deaths [1] . e pandemic has had wide-spread effects on the global and US health-care systems with significant strain on available resources. According to the US CDC COVID- 19 surveillance, as of the week ending on November 28, 2020, weekly hospitalization rates were at their highest level since the beginning of the pandemic, with a cumulative COVID-19-associated hospitalization rate of 262.8 per 100,000 population [2] . e HHS recently released granular data from 2200 counties across the US detailing hospital and ICU usage. e data shows that, in 126 counties, hospitals are at least 90% occupied. On a national level, almost 15% of inpatient beds are currently estimated to be occupied by a COVID-19 patient. Moreover, since the beginning of the pandemic, studies have shown a significant increase in mortality related to non-COVID-related illnesses [3] . ese facts highlight the pandemic's wide-reaching impact that extends beyond the direct mortality related to SARS-CoV-2 itself. Some current data suggest that case-fatality rates are trending down independent of confounding factors [4] . e data support the idea that improved treatment strategies and a better understanding of prognostic factors may reduce case fatality. However, clear markers that predict an adverse clinical outcome early on and identify patients that are potential candidates for select current treatment options remain elusive. Previous studies have examined the characteristics of patients with severe COVID-19.",

As expected, ICU admission was a strong predictor for mortality with a remarkably higher proportion of ICU admission in the subgroup with in-hospital mortality (74% vs. 16%, respectively, with P value \ufffd<0.001). Higher rates of obesity are noted among patients admitted with COVID-19, with almost half (47%) of the patients having a BMI\u2265 30 kg/m2. D-dimer, ferritin, and lactic acid levels were all more elevated in patients with in-hospital mortality compared to patients without in-hospital mortality.

In support of this theory, it has been shown that coronaviruses possess particular proteins that dysregulate the immune response in infected individuals, which can induce excessive inflammatory states [13] . e RISC-19-ICU (Risk Stratification of COVID-19 patients in the intensive-care unit) was developed in Europe to evaluate the characteristics of patients with a critical illness. In this cohort of patients, the factors identified to be associated with more severe disease (lactate, D-dimer, creatinine, and Critical Care Research and Practice others) are markers of oxygenation deficit and renal and microvascular dysfunction, as well as coagulopathy, pathological processes associated with high levels of inflammation [6] . Previous research suggests that low serum albumin may be significantly correlated with increasing physiologic stress, such as, in particular, inflammation. During proinflammatory states, cytokines increase capillary permeability and allow nutrients, including albumin, to escape into the interstitium. Decreased albumin levels may also be secondary to the increased protein degradation by cells to provide amino acid building blocks for the interstitial matrix synthesis and cell proliferation. erefore, the reduced serum albumin levels in inflammatory states may reflect the increased escape of albumin from the vascular space and uptake by cells rather than a decrease in synthesis [14] .",
