To achieve this, a llama was immunized using a recombinant SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein and an immune phage-display library of variable domains was developed. The sdAbs selected from this library segregated into five distinct sequence families. Three of these families bind to unique epitopes with high affinity, low nM to sub-nM K D , as determined by surface plasmon resonance. To further enhance the utility of these sdAbs for the detection of nucleocapsid protein, homobivalent and heterobivalent genetic fusion constructs of the three high-affinity sdAbs were prepared. The effectiveness of the sdAbs for the detection of nucleocapsid protein was evaluated using MagPlex fluid array assays, a multiplexed immunoassay on color-coded magnetic microspheres. Using the optimal bivalent pair, one immobilized on the microsphere and the other serving as the biotinylated recognition reagent, a detection limit as low as 50 pg/mL of recombinant nucleocapsid and of killed virus down to 1.28 \u00d7 10 3 pfu/mL was achieved. The sdAbs described here represent immune reagents that can be tailored to be optimized for a number of detection platforms and may one day aid in the detection of SARS-CoV-2 to assist in controlling the current pandemic.",

Nucleic acid testing, chest computed tomography, confirmation of epidemiological history, and clinical manifestations are important bases for the diagnosis of COVID-19. 1\u22124 However, nucleic acid testing is time-consuming and very costly as it requires specific reagents, expensive specialized equipment, and skilled technicians. Additionally, nucleic acid tests can yield positive results after a patient is no longer in a period of high infectivity. 5 It is well accepted that a \"positive\" polymerase chain reaction (PCR) result reflects only the detection of viral RNA and does not necessarily indicate the presence of a viable virus. In comparison, the coronavirus antigen detection methods have the advantage of being rapid, less expensive, and relatively easy to perform. Thus, antigenbased testing provides a modality that complements the gold standard nucleic acid assays by filling in the testing gaps. Viral antigen can serve as a specific marker for viral infection and significantly precedes the patient antibody response, often by days within infected people. In the case of SARS and SARS-CoV-2, the antigen can be detected up to 1 day before the appearance of clinical symptoms. 5, 6 Additionally, antigen testing has the potential to identify those who have high levels of virus, making them likely to be highly infectious. 7 Thus, detection of the viral antigen fills the role for a rapid screening assay, achieving the critical early diagnosis required to limit further viral spread.",

Also known as nanobodies or VHHs, sdAbs are the antigenbinding fragments derived from the unconventional heavychain-only antibodies found in camelids, a family that includes camels, llamas, and alpacas. 22\u221224 They possess many advantages over conventional antibodies including remarkable stability, ability to bind to hidden epitopes, and can be engineered to work optimally for specific applications. 25 In addition, these antibodies are small and easily produced in good quantity in Escherichia coli or yeast. SdAbs have been tapped as potential therapeutics and prophylactics for SARS-CoV-2, with reports of several high-affinity sdAbs specific for S showing promise in preventing viral infection. 26, 27 Multivalent sdAb constructs were demonstrated to further improve the neutralization potential. 28 In this report, we show that sdAbs directed toward N can be utilized for diagnostics; incorporating bivalent sdAb constructs into MagPlex assays led to improved detection over the standard sdAb constructs. Llama Immunizations. Llama immunizations were performed by Triple J farms (Bellingham, WA, USA). The immunization protocols used in this work were specifically approved by the Triple J Farms Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC). One llama (Centavo) was immunized five times, each a week apart, with 100 \u03bcg of recombinant N. A week after the final boost, blood was drawn and used for the evaluation of Centavo's immune response as well as library construction. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were isolated using Unisep tubes (Novamed), RNA was purified, and then cDNA was prepared. The variable heavy domains were amplified and cloned into the pecan 21 phagedisplay vector 29 to create an immune sdAb library. 30 Centavo's antibody titer was measured using the purified platelet-rich plasma.",

All clones were found to produce well (Supporting Information, Table S1); NRL-N-B6 was the lowest at 2 mg/L, and other clones from this family may be tested in the future to examine if they produce better.

Specificity and an indication of affinity were appraised via the direct binding of the sdAb to SARS-CoV-2 N recombinant protein immobilized on MagPlex magnetic microspheres (Luminex, Austin, TX, USA). The SARS-CoV-2 N, along with RBD, was immobilized to unique sets of MagPlex microspheres using the standard immobilization protocol provided by the manufacturer. To prepare the biotinylated (Bt) tracer reagent, 10-fold excess of EZ-Link NHS-LC-LC-Biotin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was added to 300 \u03bcg of each sdAb at 1 mg/mL for 30 min; excess biotin was removed using Zeba spin columns (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The Sandwich format MagPlex bead assays were performed in order to demonstrate the ability of the sdAbs to act as both the capture and recognition reagent for the detection of N. For these assays, each sdAb was immobilized to a set of MagPlex microspheres as described above and then tested for its ability to function as a capture antibody. Initial tests evaluated all the clones as both the immobilized capture and the Bt recognition molecule in the assay. To improve the limit of detection (LOD) for N, the same assay format was repeated using the hetero-and homobivalent constructs of the three best sdAbs. For the amplified LOD assay using the standard sdAb reagents, the N was diluted into PBST with 1 mg/mL BSA, as were all the other assay reagents, and then further diluted on a roundbottom polypropylene microtiter plate. Then, the sdAb-coated microspheres were added to provide a minimum of 50 microspheres for each set per well and incubated for 30 min. In most tests, assay process-control microspheres were included but not shown to simplify the graphs. 39 The plate was washed with PBST and incubated with the desired Bt-sdAb at 1 \u03bcg/mL for 30 min. To generate the fluorescent signal, the plate was washed and then incubated sequentially with 50 \u03bcL of SA\u2212PE at 5 \u03bcg/mL in each well for 15 min, washed again, then incubated with 50 \u03bcL of Bt goat anti-streptavidin (Bt-goat-anti-SA) from Vector Laboratories (Burlingame, CA) at 1 \u03bcg/mL for 15 min, washed, and finally incubated with SA\u2212PE as before. Then, the plate was washed a final time prior to being evaluated on the MAGPIX. A ratio of 2 for the signal/ background was utilized as the LOD as this ratio provides a signal that assures a difference that is greater than 3 times the standard deviation (SD) of the mean of both the background and the data point considered significant. The assay for the LOD for N using the bivalent sdAb reagents was similar to the above protocol other than the fact that the incubation step with N was extended to 1 h and that the N and all subsequent reagents were diluted into a 1:1 mixture of PBST and ",

            "text": "In order to generate sdAbs toward the N of SARS-CoV-2, a llama was first immunized with recombinant N. Once a successful immune response toward N was confirmed (Supporting Information, Figure S1 ), a phage-display library was prepared to capture the immune repertoire of heavy-chain antibody variable domains. After two rounds of panning on SARS-CoV-2 N, we examined 96 distinct phages using a directbinding MagPlex assay, where N was covalently attached to the microsphere and the amount of phage bound to the surface was indicated by the addition of an anti-M13-mAb\u2212 phycoerythrin conjugate. Sixteen positive clones with a signal on N at least 5 times the signal on the RBD portion of the spike protein were chosen for sequencing, which revealed five unique sequence families (Supporting Information, Figure S2 ). Sequence families are defined as a group of sdAbs sharing near identical complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). The sequences of representative clones from each of the families selected for production and further testing are shown in Figure  1 . Eight clones made up the NRL-N-B6 sequence family; five were in the NRL-N-E2 family, whereas NRL-N-C2, NRL-N-E10, and NRL-N-A9 were each single-member families. For brevity, the clones are often referred to by a shortened notation consisting of only the letter and number designation. Soluble protein was produced for each of these five clones; most produced well with yields between 2 and 37 mg/L (Supporting Information, Table S1 ). They were then examined by a direct-binding MagPlex assay to confirm specificity to N (Figure 2 ), while the affinity for each clone was determined by SPR (Table 1 and Supporting Information, Figure S3 ). Both the direct-binding MagPlex and SPR showed that clones E2, B6, and C2 outperformed both E10 and A9. In fact, clone A9 showed no specific binding as assessed by SPR and was not considered further. This was indicative that although the presence of negative control microspheres coated with RBD allowed the elimination of some of the clones that exhibited nonspecific binding in the initial phage-display screening, it was not a foolproof process. The thermal stability and ability to refold for the four specific sdAbs were evaluated by CD (Supporting Information, Table S1 ). The sdAbs displayed melting temperatures ranging from 55 to 70\u00b0C and refolding of between 41 and 87% after heat denaturation; however, both of those properties can be improved through protein engineering. 40 Differences in refolding percentages are only significant in broad ranges, where good refolding is 85% or better, moderate refolding being 50\u221285%, and poor refolding less than 50%. These values can easily be improved by lowering the isoelectric point of the sdAb, which has been seen to yield refolding percentages near 100%. 35, 41 Affinity is just one measure of utility; binders with sub-nM K D all have sufficient affinity to have utility in detection assays and require empiric testing to determine the best binder or binding pair for the application being optimized. While directbinding assays are good for demonstrating the binding ability and assessing specificity, antibody reagents ultimately need to work in a sandwich format for most antibody-based diagnostic assays. Because clones E2, B6, and C2 appeared to have the best binding characteristics of the five, we focused on integrating them into a sandwich format. First, by immobilizing each sdAb onto microspheres, we performed a checkerboard assay that indicated that each sdAb binds to a distinct epitope on N (Figure 3) . Although native N is multimeric in nature, 42 our data suggest that the recombinant N is monomeric as it can be seen that none of the sdAbs works efficiently as both capture and tracer; however, each can be paired with either of the other two.",

Using this numbering scheme, we define CDR1 as the region of amino acid residues 26\u221235, CDR2: 50\u221265, and CDR3: 99\u2212119. Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article was the best capture and recognizes a different epitope than C2 and B6, we chose to construct a bivalent version of E2 as well as combine E2 with C2 and B6 and combine C2 with B6. We also made a C2\u2212C2 construct to determine if the bivalent version would prove to be a better capture reagent. Directbinding MagPlex assays showed that the E2\u2212B6 and E2\u2212C2 heterobivalent constructs were much better than the standard sdAbs, while the other constructs did not perform much different in this format (Supporting Information, Figure S4 ). Analysis by SPR (Table 1) showed that with the exception of C2\u2212C2, the other bivalent constructs all had sub-nM affinity for N, thus achieving the avidity, an apparent enhanced affinity, which was desired. The bivalent sdAbs were incorporated into sandwich assays as both capture and tracer reagents. The E2\u2212E2 and E2\u2212C2 captures in conjunction with the Bt-C2\u2212B6 tracer yielded the best results; dose\u2212response curves were evaluated in preliminary experiments for all the reagents (not shown). To achieve consistent high sensitivity, it was necessary to utilize a two-step amplification where the initial signal generated by SA\u2212PE is amplified by the addition of a layer of Bt-goat anti-SA, followed by a second layer of SA\u2212PE. This amplification method has been found to provide little advantage for conventional antibodies but has shown to improve MagPlex assays using sdAbs by a factor of 5 or better. 32, 45 Using this protocol, we obtained a LOD for N of 50 pg/mL ( Figure 5 ). This same assay was evaluated for the detection of the killed virus where all the viral components are present; a LOD of 1.28 \u00d7 10 3 pfu/mL killed virus was obtained using E2\u2212C2 as the capture reagent ( Figure 6 ).

One can prepare 96 samples in about 2 h and they can be evaluated on the MAGPIX instrument in less than 1 h. One challenge of using the amplification step is maintaining a low background. Initial studies showed a signal response at equally low concentrations, but it did not always achieve the desired LOD or a consistent dose response. By using 1:1 PBST/ LowCross buffer for the sample and all assay reagents, Analytical Chemistry pubs.acs.org/ac Article consistent sensitive results were obtained. 39 The challenge will be to achieve these results with actual samples. At this point, we also desired to investigate the cross reactivity of these reagents. MagPlex microspheres coated with E2, C2, B6, E2\u2212E2, and E2\u2212C2 were combined and tested simultaneously with each as the Bt tracer antibody. Since E2\u2212 C2 was functional as a capture for each of the Bt sdAb used as the tracer antibody, only that set is shown in Figure 7 . Figure 8 shows the results with the E2\u2212E2 capture and the Bt-C2\u2212B6 tracer; additional data are not shown as the data presented provided the illuminating findings. The tracers that included B6 have strong cross reactivity to SARS-CoV N; otherwise, these reagents show good selectivity with cross reactivity to the other NP variants observed only at high concentrations. It is not surprising to observe cross reactivity with the SARS-CoV N as high similarity (over 87%) has been noted between the N sequence of SARS-CoV-2 and the N sequence of other \u03b2 coronaviruses (i.e., SARS-CoV). 46 As both of these coronaviruses can be associated with severe diseases, this cross reactivity should not be a liability for an assay built with the sdAbs, especially as MagPlex assays can easily be multiplexed. It appears that E2 has much better selectivity than the other sdAbs, so it would be possible to detect and discriminate both SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 simultaneously using multiple capture bead sets. This is confirmed in Figure 8 , where the response to SARS-CoV NP was much less for E2\u2212E2 as the capture molecule than that was observed for E2\u2212C2 in Figure  7 .",

Another potential concern is the ability of diagnostic reagents to recognize N variants. Although one would not expect the binding to N to be under the same evolutionary pressure to develop an escape mutant that binding to the RBD of the S protein is under, substitutions are found within the N. An examination of N from over 38,000 SARS-CoV-2 sequences showed that mutations cluster in the linker region between the RNA-binding domain and the dimerization domain. 47 Future studies to elucidate the epitopes of the N-binding sdAbs would be helpful in determining if they bind in the conserved regions of N or in regions more prone to substitutions.",

These three sdAbs bind with high affinity, and by the formation of heterobivalent and homobivalent constructs, we were able to achieve sub-nM affinities. Selecting the best pairs of bivalent constructs, we developed a MagPlex fluid array assay that achieved a LOD of 50 pg/mL for N and 1.28 \u00d7 10 3 pfu/mL for the killed virus. Specificity testing showed significant binding to only the N of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, indicating highly selective binding. In addition, it should also be possible to further improve the sensitivity of detection on the MAGPIX platform, as a neither a means to orient the capture molecule, nor peptide tail additions that allow for increased biotinylation were applied to these constructs. 39 ,51 Furthermore, it should be possible to engineer these same sdAbs to possess enhanced thermal stability or optimize them to enable the sensitive detection of SARS-CoV-2 on other detection platforms. Other applications focused toward the use of these sdAbs as therapeutics might also be envisioned. This work, by inclusion of the sequences of sdAbs discovered here, enables those efforts to proceed unfettered and hopefully can provide additional tools to help defeat this ongoing pandemic.

A dose\u2212response bar graph for an experiment conducted with eight replicates at each concentration is shown; error bars represent the SD of those eight replicates. This experiment was repeated three times, once as shown, once in quadruplicate, and once in triplicate, all giving similar results.
