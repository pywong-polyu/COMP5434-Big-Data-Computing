While psychological interventions have been an effective treatment for mild-to-moderate depression and have shown comparable outcomes to pharmacotherapy [2] , the increased demand for mental healthcare has caused lengthy waitlists for individuals seeking care for psychological distress [3] . For individuals in rural or remote communities, access to care is even more limited. Moreover, a proportion of individuals do not achieve full remission of symptoms from psychotherapy [4] or have a desire to seek other treatment options [5] . There is an urgent need for alternative approaches to established therapy which may alleviate the burden on mental health services, including responsive and flexible delivery models that reach those experiencing barriers to accessing conventional care.",

A 12-week whole-of-diet intervention in 67 participants with moderate-to-severe depression was efficacious for reducing clinical depression [7] . It also found a cost saving of approximately $2600 per participant in the dietary condition due to reduced healthcare costs and reduced absenteeism [8] . A group-based study taking a similar approach to depression treatment yielded comparable findings and was also shown to be highly cost-effective [9] . These studies-backed up by level 1 evidence for dietary support to reduce depressive symptoms for a range of health conditions [10] -point to the potential of lifestyle therapies for producing large health benefits and cost savings in people with mental illness. Meta-analyses show physical activity interventions are also efficacious in treating depression [11, 12] . Literature reviews and preliminary experimental work indicate that physical activity can provide positive effects on neural structures [13] , mental health [12, 14] and cognitive function [15] . These benefits also appear in the absence of clinical disorders, with a recent study reporting that an 8-week resistance exercise program significantly reduced anxiety symptoms in young adults without generalised anxiety disorder [16] .",

Additionally, in the context of restricted physical mobility and pre-existing mental health concerns (such as agoraphobia and social anxiety), telehealth programs are highly applicable. A multimodal, integrated lifestyle telehealth intervention showed considerable promise for reducing depressive symptoms (assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 (PHQ-9)) compared to standard care, especially for those with a history of depression after a heart attack [18] . In addition, home exercise prescribed using a web-based exercise program resulted in higher confidence and engagement in physical activity compared to standard care [19] .

In addition to the direct impact of the disease itself (i.e. infection, fear of infection, loss of loved ones), the indirect impact of public health policy to promote infection control (such as lockdowns and restricted freedoms) may have exacerbated mental health symptoms in those with pre-existing mental health concerns [22] .

The primary outcome is depressive symptoms (assessed via the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) at 8 weeks.

This paper presents the study protocol for the CALM (Curbing Anxiety and depression using Lifestyle Medicine) randomised controlled trial based in Victoria, Australia. The aim is to examine the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an integrated lifestyle program (CALM) compared to an established psychotherapy program-both delivered via telehealth. We hypothesise that the CALM program will not be inferior to the psychotherapy program for depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores) at 8 weeks.",

During this trial period, participants cannot be involved in another intervention study. Participants cannot be pregnant, breastfeeding, or planning pregnancy within the next year. Participants are asked to provide blood and stool samples on two occasions (pre-and post-intervention). As this study aims to determine the effectiveness of the CALM intervention as an adjunctive therapy, ongoing pharmacological or other treatments during the intervention period is not an exclusion criterion. However, participants are excluded if they commence a new, duplicating treatment (e.g., psychotherapy) for a mental illness within a 1-month period prior to baseline or are experiencing an exacerbation of symptoms not adequately controlled by medication. Finally, participants must be deemed suitable for participation in a structured lifestyle or psychotherapy program for 8 weeks (i.e. not in crisis or suicidal at time of enrolment). Where evidence of acute suicidality or mental health crisis is identified during enrolment, a risk screening is conducted by a mental health clinician (TJ) to determine eligibility for participation.

In addition to being administered pre-and post-intervention, the K-10 is also administered each week during the intervention period to assess participant's levels of generalised psychological distress. The K-10 consists of 10 items to measure non-specific psychological distress [34] and is commonly used in clinical and epidemiological contexts. Scores range from 10 to 50, with higher scores indicating more severe psychological distress. The K-10 is used to examine whether the interventions are having a positive effect on psychological distress throughout the course of treatment. An increase by more than 0.5 standard deviations, or a K10 score increase above 30, between sessions initiates safety protocol procedures. An independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) is overseeing the trial to maximise participant safety and identify patterns in adverse events that may be related to either program. The DSMB consists of members who collectively have experience in the lifestyle based interventions, digital interventions, biostatistics, and randomised clinical trials.",

This was based both on statistical reasoning (sample size and recruitment feasibility over the funded 18-month study period), clinical judgement and other psychotherapy trials using non-inferiority designs [72] . Assuming a standard deviation of 4, onesided type I error = 0.025 and 80% power, a total sample size of N = 160 (n = 80 participants assigned to each group) will be required and inflated by 15% (N = 184) to allow for comparable attrition to that observed in our other telehealth trials (e.g., [18] ).",

The CALM program is a discrete service model that provides an opportunity for adults with (or at risk of developing) a mental disorder to access lifestyle-based mental health care. Lifestyle approaches have also been proven to address shared risk factors for comorbid non-communicable medical disorders [75] . In the context of a global pandemic when psychological distress is high, additional strain has been placed upon an already overburdened mental healthcare system and face-to-face care has been disrupted, the telehealth model employed as part of the CALM trial has the potential to provide an additional pathway to ease such barriers. If CALM is non-inferior to established psychotherapy, it has the potential not only to provide additional and supplementary care to individuals with mental health concerns but to enable the workforce of dietitians and exercise professionals to support mental healthcare during COVID-19 and beyond. For the first time, our study will provide real-world data on the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of an integrated lifestyle program compared to established psychotherapy and is anticipated to produce dual mental and physical health benefits that may have long-term health and cost-savings.",
