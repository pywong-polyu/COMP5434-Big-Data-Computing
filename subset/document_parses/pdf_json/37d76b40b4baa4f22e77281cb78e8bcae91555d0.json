One such approach that has been proposed for the prevention of COVID19 is the use of live-attenuated vaccines with known protective effects against heterologous infections . Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) was developed as a vaccine against tuberculosis, but epidemiological studies have suggested its capability to protect also against other infectious diseases (Benn et al., 2013) . In infants, early administration of BCG vaccination leads to reduced child mortality, mainly as a result of reduced neonatal sepsis and respiratory infections (Aaby et al., 2011; Biering-S\u00f8rensen et al., 2012; Prentice et al., 2021) , while revaccination with BCG in adolescents has shown a 70% decrease in the incidence of respiratory tract infections compared to placebo (Nemes et al., 2018) . In addition, we also recently demonstrated in a randomized placebocontrolled trial (ACTIVATE), that BCG revaccination in elderly individuals can induce up to 80% reduction of the incidence of respiratory tract infections (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020) .",

While the data of the current study are in line with a number of studies showing an association between countries that implement BCG vaccination at birth and a low prevalence of COVID19 (Berg et al., 2020; Escobar et al., 2020) , not all studies were however able to reproduce these findings (Hamiel et al., 2020; Wassenaar et al., 2020) . Ecological studies are also prone to bias, and thus such arguments based on ecological analyses need to be considered with caution. On the other hand, other recent studies have also shown reduced COVID-19 incidence in an observational study of recent BCG vaccination (Amirlak et al., 2020), and a reduced severity of the disease in children vaccinated with BCG (Chen et al., 2021) , all which support the observation reported here of a protective effect of BCG.",

Upon stimulation with certain microorganisms, the innate immune system becomes primed and is able to react faster and more efficient to secondary (and non-related) stimuli. In experimental studies, BCG has been shown to protect not only against bacterial and fungal infections, but against viral infections such as influenza as well (Spencer et al., 1977) . Furthermore, we recently showed that in volunteers receiving yellow fever vaccine virus, those who had recently received BCG had -compared to placebo- An intriguing observation was made when COVID-19 serology was investigated, in order to identify the potential asymptomatic cases: only 1.3% of the placebovaccinated individuals were positive, while 4.7% of the BCG-vaccinated individuals showed positive anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies.

            "text": "of countries around the world both in children and adults. It is interesting to observe that a certain pattern starts to emerge in which trials in developing countries or countries that employed BCG vaccination programs show beneficial effects of BCG re-vaccination, while countries in which first BCG vaccination is administered in na\u00efve populations of developed countries the effect seems to be less strong. In children, clinical trials in Africa have shown significant protection of BCG vaccination against mortality (Aaby et al., 2011; Biering-S\u00f8rensen et al., 2012) and infections (Prentice et al., 2021) , but such effect failed to materialize in a recent large trial in Denmark (Stensballe et al., 2019) . Interestingly however, in the Calmette study from Denmark, BCG vaccination induced a 30% protection of the child against infections if the mother was also BCG-vaccinated, while no effect was seen if the mother never received BCG (Berendsen et al., 2020) . Similarly, BCG revaccination in South-African adolescents resulted in 73% less infections (Nemes et al., 2018) , while BCG vaccination in Greek elderly resulted in 80% less respiratory tract infections (Giamarellos-Bourboulis et al., 2020) .

Second, our ability to control the COVID-19 pandemic is continuously challenged by the appearance of new variants of the virus, some of them that show increased escape rates against the newly developed vaccines (Kustin et al., 2021) . The employment of trained immunity-based vaccines that boost anti-viral host defense in an antigenindependent manner could thus prove very important in situations in which such viral variants become most prevailing. Third, the principle that heterologous vaccines can be employed with success in the real-life situation of a pandemic is extremely important for future pandemic preparedness: it is conceivable that a strategy employing such vaccines can be used as 'bridge vaccination' for partial protection of the population even before specific vaccines are available . It is to be hoped that the results of the present study will encourage more research for identifying the most effective set of heterologous vaccines that can be stored, tested, and used in a future pandemic to avoid the high healthcare, societal and economic toll that can be exerted by a dangerous new pathogen.",
