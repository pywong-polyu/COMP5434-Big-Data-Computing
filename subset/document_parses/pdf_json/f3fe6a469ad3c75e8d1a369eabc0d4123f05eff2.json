            "text": "The development of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) following infection or immunization is a central pillar of long-lasting immunity against virus infection. nAbs are principally involved in virus particle neutralization, the process by which virion entry is blocked by antibodies that inhibit receptor engagement, block uptake outright, inhibit endocytosis, cause OPEN ACCESS aggregation and/or trigger complement activation [1, 2] . Accordingly, the majority of assays to identify nAbs focus on mimicking this process, involving derivations of the ubiquitous virus neutralization test (VNT) with live virus particles or pseudotyped surrogates [2] [3] [4] . Certain viruses, however, can also spread by directly inducing cell-cell fusion, resulting in multinucleated cells or syncytia [5] , including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the recently emerged coronavirus responsible for the ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic [6, 7] . Importantly, not all particle-neutralizing nAbs are capable of inhibiting cell-cell fusion and vice versa, and there are currently few robust methodologies available to specifically dissect the development and properties of fusion-inhibitory nAbs, which may be less abundant than standard nAbs, but necessary as an additional barrier to stop viral spread.",

            "text": "For enveloped viruses the viral glycoproteins found on the surface of virions represent the major target of nAbs. Whilst the exact mechanism of particle attachment and membrane varies, some essential principles are maintained [8] . Briefly, viral glycoproteins, often oligomeric, are embedded in the virion surface by transmembrane domains, with the majority of the protein being exterior to the virion (the ectodomain). These complexes are assembled in a pre-fusion state, maintained by intra or inter-molecular constraints, with a hydrophobic fusion loop or peptide buried within the interior of the oligomer. The capacity to initiate membrane fusion is normally primed by proteolytic cleavage of the fusogen polypeptide and triggered by ligand binding. The latter step represents the area with the greatest mechanistic heterogeneity. Viruses such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and SARS-CoV-2 have a single trimeric fusogen (their fusion (F) and spike (S) proteins, respectively) that mediate both attachment and fusion, while for others, such as Nipah virus (NiV), a separate protein (glycoprotein, G) maintains the fusion (F) protein in its pre-fusion state, with triggering of F controlled by receptor binding by G. Nevertheless, the final steps are orthologous, with the fusogens undergoing large structural rearrangements to embed the fusion peptide in the host membrane, leading to the so-called post-fusion state. This process ultimately leads to the juxtaposition of viral and host membranes, the formation of a fusion pore and viral genome entry. From a nAb perspective, the development of antibodies against the pre-fusion state of the viral fusogen is considered to be favourable, as this is more likely to inhibit particle entry.",

            "text": "In previous studies, we and others have developed assays to reliably quantify cell-cell fusion induced by viruses [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Indeed, these systems have been successfully applied to examine virus host range [15] , protein-protein interactions within the attachment complex [16] , the mechanism of attachment and entry [11, 17] , and other biologically relevant questions. Seeking to adapt these systems to examine fusioninhibitory antibodies has proven technically challenging, as many of these assays are not easily adaptable to protocols that require titration of sera or purified antibodies. However, the cell-cell fusion assay we have developed for paramyxoviruses [16, 18] has proven to be applicable to a 96-well plate format with robust repeatability [13, 15] and also rapidly adaptable, for example to SARS-CoV-2 [19] . This system is based on the use of a split green fluorescent protein-Renilla luciferase reporter (rLuc-GFP) to monitor cytoplasmic mixing after cell-cell fusion [20] . Briefly, 'effector' cells expressing rLuc-GFP 1-7 (beta strands 1-7 of GFP) and individual viral glycoproteins (vGPs) are co-cultured with 'target' cells expressing the rLuc-GFP 8-11 (beta strands 8-11 of GFP) component and the viral receptor. When receptor engagement triggers cell-cell fusion, the cytoplasm of target and effector cells mix and the corresponding elements of the rLuc-GFP reporter reconstitute, becoming biologically active and quantifiable. In the micro-fusion inhibition test (mFIT) described herein, we have modified this assay to allow the incubation of effector cells with sera or monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), to quantify their fusion-inhibition phenotype (Fig. 1) . Whilst related assays have been described in the past [21] , we believe that the mFIT provides a simple, high-throughput and tractable assay that is easily adapted to different viruses.",

            "text": "Our initial focus in this study was the development of mFITs for three medically and agriculturally important paramyxoviruses; human and bovine respiratory syncytial virus (h/b RSV; closely related orthopneumoviruses) and NiV (a henipavirus). hRSV is a significant cause of respiratory disease, morbidity and mortality in children and the elderly, whilst bRSV causes respiratory disease resulting in large losses to the global dairy and cattle industry. NiV is an emerging zoonotic pathogen, currently restricted to South and South-East Asia, which can be transmitted from its natural reservoir -fruit bats -to humans, causing a highly fatal respiratory and neurological disease. In the first outbreak of NiV in Malaysia in 1999 the virus also infected pigs, which served as an amplification reservoir allowing spread to farm workers [22] . For both NiV and hRSV there are no licensed vaccines for use in humans; with the only licensed therapeutic being a monoclonal antibody against the hRSV F protein [23, 24] . Following the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in late 2019, and its pandemic spread from early 2020, we also developed an equivalent assay for this coronavirus, alongside SARS-CoV, to facilitate the examination and characterization of fusion-inhibitory antibodies against this virus. Importantly, for all the viruses described here there is established evidence (or emerging for SARS-CoV-2 [25] [26] [27] ) that viral syncytia form in the tissues of infected individuals or animal models of disease [3, [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] , highlighting the importance of this route of spread. We hope that the development of mFIT assays for these viruses will enable a broader understanding of the mechanisms of virus neutralization and the immune response to fusogenic viruses, and in doing so facilitate the development of novel vaccines and therapeutics.",

Unsurprisingly, the site I-binding antibody 4D7 showed no capacity for inhibiting hRSV-Fmediated fusion in our mFIT, correlating with this mAb binding only the post-fusion variant of this epitope. In contrast, antibody binding sites II and IV, which are able to access their epitopes on both the pre-and post-fusion forms of RSV-F, showed much greater capacity for inhibition in our mFIT. 101F (site IV) showed robust inhibition of hRSV-F fusion even at 1.25 \u00b5g ml \u22121 , while inhibition by MOTA (site II) gradually titred out between 5 1 and 1.25 \u00b5g ml \u22121 . AM14 (site V) and MPE8 (site III), which bind to the pre-fusion form of RSV-F, were also able to potently inhibit RSV fusion even at the lowest concentration assessed, 1.25 \u00b5g ml \u22121 (Fig. 2c) . As an additional control we also included monoclonal antibodies to measles virus (MeV) H, which had little appreciable effect on RSV-mediated fusion. Of note, MOTA is a derivative of the licensed RSV mAb Palivizumab and MPE8 is known to cross-compete with Palivizumab [41] . The binding epitope of MPE8 is well conserved between all orthopneumoviruses -hRSV, bRSV and pneumonia virus of mice (PVM) [41] -so we carried out a side-by-side comparison of these antibodies in a bRSV-F mFIT, which demonstrated a similar trend of inhibition with both the murine and human mAbs (Fig. S5 ). Our findings highlight the antigenic similarity of these viruses and the likely conservation of epitopes between related F proteins, which are roughly 80 % identical at the amino acid level [42] . More broadly, we demonstrate that the mFIT can be rapidly used to screen the fusion-inhibitory properties of a panel of vGP-specific mAbs. ",

Firstly, the human monoclonal m102.4, which specifically interacts with the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the NiV attachment protein (G) and has strong cross-reactivity between NiV and the closely related Hendra virus (HeV) [43] (Fig. 3a ). m102.4 was shown to be protective in several animal studies and has also been administered to individuals at high risk of exposure to HeV [3, [44] [45] [46] . The second monoclonal (humanized m5B3) recognizes the prefusion forms of NiV and HeV-F proteins and has been shown to inhibit membrane fusion by holding F in its pre-fusion form [47] (Fig. 3a) . We found that the F-binding m5B3 was able to robustly inhibit fusion at 20 \u00b5g ml \u22121 , which titred out at 2 \u00b5g ml \u22121 . Interestingly, the G-specific m102.4 was also able to inhibit NiV fusion at 20 \u00b5g ml \u22121 , albeit at reduced levels ( Fig. 3b) . In contrast to our mFIT results, both m102.4 and m5B3 were able to inhibit NiV particle entry at 10 \u00b5g ml \u22121 in micro virus neutralization tests (mVNTs) using pseudotyped NiV, with this inhibition beginning to titre out at 0.1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 (Fig. 3c ). Of note, we included the RSV F mAb 101F as a negative control, with this mAb showing no significant inhibition of NiV-mediated fusion in either assay. These differences highlight how mFITs and VNTs can be used in tandem to probe the neutralizing properties of antibodies against vGPs.",

To date, however, little is known about the cell-cell fusion-inhibitory phenotype of these nAbs. For NiV vaccines the development of fusion-inhibitory responses may correlate significantly with immunity, since syncytia cell formation has consistently been observed in the infected tissues of experimentally infected animals [29, [49] [50] [51] [52] . Using a homologous prime (day 0) and boost (day 21) regime, our NiV-F and NiV-G vaccine candidates were inoculated into pigs and blood samples were taken every week until 42 days post-vaccination. Sera from some of these vaccinated animals, as well as from an adjuvant-only control group, were examined for cell-cell fusion-inhibitory Abs. mFIT results from single representative animals from each group demonstrate that a fusion-inhibitory response is generated by both NiV-F and NiV-G vaccines pre-boost and that this response is significantly boosted following the second inoculation of the recombinant protein on day 21 (Fig. 3d) . The development of fusion-inhibitory Abs is specific to the vaccine groups, as the adjuvant-only immunized animal did not develop equivalent responses (Fig. 3d) . We were also able to show a positive correlation (Pearson R=0.66, R 2 =0.43) between fusion inhibition and particle neutralization titres using NiV pseudotypes in mVNTs (Fig. 3e , f, Table S2 ). In summary, the mFITs carried out using NiV-specific mAbs and sera from vaccinated animals highlight the broad applicability of this assay and the presence of nAbs that inhibit particle fusion, cell-cell fusion, or both.",

We first examined whether a soluble version of the ACE2 receptor fused to the human IgG1 Fc (hinge-CH2-CH3) (ACE2-Fc) was able to inhibit S-mediated fusion. ACE2-Fc was able to inhibit approximately 50 % of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 fusion when used at 100 \u00b5g ml \u22121 with corresponding SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 pseudoparticles being neutralized at lower concentrations in mVNTs (Fig. 4b, c) . As proof of principle, we also examined whether the SARS-CoV-specific mAb S230 could inhibit SARS-CoV fusion in an mFIT. S230 binds the SARS-CoV S receptorbinding domain RBD; however, this epitope is not completely conserved in SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. 4a) [53, 54] . While S230 was able to potently inhibit SARS-CoV cell-cell fusion and pseudoparticle entry, this was not the case for SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4b, c) . This finding is congruent with previous studies investigating S230 escape mutants, demonstrating that residue L443 in SARS-CoV S is central and key for S230 binding [53] . An alignment of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV 2 RBDs revealed this residue to be divergent between the two coronaviruses, resulting in reduced S230 binding and functionality (Fig. 4a) . Nevertheless, these results highlight the potential importance of the mFIT for screening SARS-CoV-2 therapeutic candidates mAbs.",

With this in mind, we performed mFITs on plasma from convalescent donors who have recovered from COVID-19, alongside a negative plasma pool (from healthy donors collected prior to 2019). We found that all five donors were able to inhibit SARS-CoV-2 cell-cell fusion by >50 % when their plasma was used at a 1 : 20 dilution, although this dropped to 2/5 at the next dilution (1 : 40). As expected, the negative plasma was unable to inhibit fusion (Fig. 4d) . We also demonstrated a good positive correlation (Pearson R=0.89, R 2 =0.79) between mFIT IC 50 values calculated for each of these donors and the corresponding IC 50 values from mVNTs (Fig. 4e, f) , allowing us to conclude that SARS-CoV-2 infection can lead to the development of cell-cell fusioninhibitory nAbs.",

            "text": "Herein we have demonstrated the broad applicability of the viral mFIT, examining neutralization of cell-cell fusion by monoclonal antibodies and recombinant proteins as well as sera from vaccinated animals and plasma from naturally infected individuals. This assay allows the de facto calculation of fusion-inhibitory IC 50 and IC 90 , which we demonstrated correlated well with more classical approaches such as mVNTs. While virus particle neutralization and antibodymediated inhibition of viral-induced cell-cell fusion are likely to functionally overlap, based on the mutual recognition of epitopes on the surface of viral glycoproteins and the subsequent blocking of their related mechanisms of action, there may be distinct nAb clones that neutralize particles but cannot block fusion or vice versa. The combined use of mFITs and VNTs could prove useful in delineating these differences. This assay builds on existing techniques for the identification of antibody-mediated inhibition of cell-cell fusion, including classical observation of syncytia formation by microscopy, computational analysis of images to quantify syncytia formation, HIV-based variations of the dual-reporter assay [12] and assays based on the quantification of cellular electrical impedance [55] . Clearly, from our data, the mFIT can be applied to different viruses, dependent only on the availability of a cloned viral glycoprotein capable of inducing fusion. On this, we have also demonstrated that this assay is rapidly adaptable, in our case for SARS-CoV-2. The detection of fusion-inhibitory responses in human plasma from COVID-19 convalescent individuals highlights the clinical relevance and potential uses of this assay, especially important when considering the emerging evidence that SARS-CoV-2 causes syncytia formation in the lungs of infected individuals [25, 27] . We propose that the mFIT could be used in the assessment of COVID-19 vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy trials as well as in the assessment of candidate therapeutic mAbs, and hypothesize that the development of a highly fusion-inhibitory antibody response may correlate well with protection from infection. Separately, the mFITs for bRSV, hRSV and NiV have allowed us to functionally probe the fusion-inhibitory activity of well-characterized RSV F and NiV mAbs, including those approved for use or in clinical trial. The sensitivity of RSV fusion to the mAbs tested supports their therapeutic use, since this virus is known to spread via fusion in the lungs of infected individuals [56] . This inhibition also correlated well with our understanding of the RSV F protein and which epitopes are available for Ab-binding on the pre-and post-fusion variants of the protein. In related immunogenicity studies we were also able to monitor the emergence of a fusion-inhibitory nAb response following NiV vaccination in pigs. When interpreting the inhibitory capacity of antibodies used in this assay, it is important to consider the potential mechanisms of action of these antibodies. Inhibition may not necessarily correlate to direct inhibition of the glycoprotein fusion machinery, but instead inhibition of the steps leading up to fusion. We therefore propose three mechanisms of action: (1) antibodies block attachment, preventing receptor engagement and downstream activation of fusion, e.g. m102.4, which interacts with the RBD of NiV-G, not NiV-F; (2) antibodies bind sites distal to the RBD, blocking the activation of F by preventing conformational changes from a pre-to post-fusion state; (3) antibodies bind on or near the fusion peptide, directly inhibiting this domain being embedded in the host cell membrane. To date, our system has been optimized for viral glycoproteins that are physiologically active at neutral pH; however, we believe adaptation for glycoproteins that require a lower pH to trigger fusion is feasible. Indeed, we have already demonstrated that lowering the pH in VSV-G-transfected cells leads to cell-cell fusion (data not shown) and we are currently performing similar experiments with influenza HA, using a transient pH activation of effector cells to activate the fusogen prior to co-culture.",

            "text": "In general, the amount of mAb or sera required to elicit neutralization of fusion is roughly twice that required for mVNTs. This reflects both the prevalence of fusion-inhibitory nAbs in sera and the level of viral glycoproteins available to induce fusion on the surface of transfected cells. There is likely to be more vGP present on the surface of an effector cell in our fusion assay compared with that on the surface of a pseudoparticle in a mVNT. Indeed, the constructs used to drive vGP expression are codon-optimized for human cells, which probably increases the amount of antibody required to inhibit fusion. This aspect of our assay in particular requires careful optimization as a balance needs to be struck between fusion and establishing a window for antibody-mediated inhibition of this process. Of note, RSV codon optimization is fundamental to the success of the mFIT, as expression of non-codon-optimized, RSV wild-type F ORF does not result in detectable levels of fusion (data not shown). There are some notable exceptions to this general trend, however, specifically those antibodies or proteins that target receptor interactions (ACE2 and m102.4). In this case neutralization in the mVNTs was far more efficient than in the mFITs, likely because cells are already in close proximity in the cell-cell fusion assay, with vGP abundance and Ab accessibility presumably constraining neutralization. Although we did not identify any instance where mFIT neutralization was more potent than mVNT, the identification and characterization of such a protein, antibody or antiviral in the future would be of broad interest. There are other technical aspects to this assay that also require consideration. One of the key conclusions to be drawn from our optimization is that too much transfected DNA is inhibitory, perhaps due to vGP overexpression and cytotoxicity. In addition, the kinetics of fusion can vary. For example, NiV effector cells are markedly more fusogenic 2 days post-transfection, while for RSV 1 day leads to superior fusion (Fig. S3 ). In addition, the varying fusogenicity of vGPs may impact on antibody-mediated inhibition of cellcell fusion. To inhibit NiV fusion, for example, 20 \u00b5g ml \u22121 of inhibitory antibody is required, whereas for RSV 5 \u00b5g ml \u22121 or less was needed. However, NiV is demonstrably more fusogenic than RSV in our assay [higher luciferase signal and greater number and size of GFP-positive syncytia (Fig.  S3) ]; as such, side-by-side comparison of different viruses and the antibody concentrations required for inhibition of fusion might not be appropriate.",

After 48 h, cell supernatants containing the lentivirus were collected, centrifuged at 1800 g for 10 min and filtered through a 0.45 \u00b5m syringe filter. One millilitre of the lentivirus-containing medium was then transduced onto HEK293T cells with 5 \u00b5g ml \u22121 polybrene (Sigma-Aldrich) for 2 h, after which cells were supplemented with 2 ml DMEM-10 % and incubated for a further 48 h. Cells were then expanded and clonally selected under 1 \u00b5g ml \u22121 puromycin (Gibco) selection.",

            "text": "The micro-fusion inhibition test (mFIT). Samples containing antibodies are incubated with effector cells (HEK293T Lenti rLuc-GFP 1-7) expressing the viral glycoprotein (vGP) of interest. The antibody-effector cell mix is then co-cultured with target cells (HEK293T Lenti rLuc-GFP 8-11) expressing the corresponding vGP's cellular receptor and incubated for 18-24 h. In (a) the presence of fusioninhibitory neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) prevents the reconstitution of the rLuc-GFP reporter in fused cells, while in (b) the absence of specific neutralizing antibodies (non-nAbs), allows vGP-mediated cell-cell fusion to occur. Subsequent mixing of the target and effector cell cytoplasm leads to reconstitution of the split reporter and increased GFP and luciferase signals.

Transfection mixes were set up in 200 \u00b5l Opti-MEM (Gibco) with the TransIT-X2 Dynamic Delivery System as per the manufacturer's recommendations (Mirus). Viral glycoproteins (vGP; hRSV-F, bRSV-F, NiV-F+NiV G, SARS-CoV S or SARS-CoV-2 S) were transfected into effector cells and the corresponding receptor (hACE2 for SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV-2 S) into target cells. For NiV and RSV, target cells were not transfected with receptor as HEK293T cells are already fusion competent. A mock-transfected (pcDNA3.1 empty plasmid, -vGP) and positive transfection control (250 ng rLuc-GFP 8-11 plasmid) was also set up. Transfections were incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5 % CO 2 for 24-48 h. Cells were then carefully washed with 2 ml fresh PRF-DMEM-10 % and harvested, and similarly transfected wells were pooled and diluted to 2\u00d710 5 ml \u22121 . Diluted effector cells were added in 100 \u00b5l volume (2\u00d710 4 cell/well) to each well of a white-bottomed, sterile 96-well plate (Corning).
