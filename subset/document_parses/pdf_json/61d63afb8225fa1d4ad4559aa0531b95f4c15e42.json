Ascertainment of pathological pathways, duration of disease, and prediction of clinical events is difficult via traditional measures such as serum creatinine fluctuations, urine studies, and urine output changes. 4 Furthermore, kidney function following AKI in the short to medium term can display several non-linear trajectories over time (including ongoing recovery) that may not associate with meaningful laboratory abnormalities, nor the etiology of AKI adjudicated during the acute hospitalization. 1, [4] [5] [6] This represents a major limitation to providing individualized care during the acute setting and in the post-AKI stage.",

This is in part due to large amounts of patient data but also due to the linear regressions used to evaluate the associations between individual or small set of biomarkers and outcomes.

As demonstrated in our study, patients these levels could be elevated and produced in the heart and vasculature while not necessarily driving worse AKI pathophysiology. Yet, given their capability to orchestrate diverse pathological cellular changes in the heart, kidney, vasculature, they have postulated as a redundant pathway leading to death. Patients in this cluster could resemble those with advanced heart and kidney disease, who present with cardiorenal syndrome. Conversely to prior data, it is possible that patients with creatinine fluctuations in the context of ischemic or hemodynamic changes (i.e. cardiorenal syndrome) without significant tubular injury activity could still present increased morbidity and risk of clinical events, mediated by these TNFR1 and TNFR2.

In the advent of new therapies that could potentially modulate inflammatory-predominant type kidney disease (i.e. SGLT2 inhibitors) or fibrosis (i.e. mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists), identifying these pathologic domains could be build up in process of exploring therapeutic targets in AKI or in the post-AKI stage; understanding that all AKI are not created equal. Our analyses were robust and validated through different unsupervised algorithms and our data builds upon previous analyses showing that AKI and CKD subphenotypes with can eventually lead to different outcomes. While these studies do not inform on underlying biological pathophysiology, our study is novel by incorporating biomarkers of key domains involved in kidney disease progression. Future studies may attempt to explore whether individuals within the same AKI subphenotype could share similar proteins and transcripts responsible of the biomarker composites and clinical outcomes evidenced in our cohort (multi-omic level). Using this clustering approach could assist with the challenges of stratifying AKI in different scenarios such as sepsis, acute cardiac injury, community-acquired AKI, and advanced organ disease.",

The angle of this study is unique and complementary to previous data, since we aimed to identify potentially useful 'data patterns' over statistically and numerally significant features that emulate real world data abundance.
