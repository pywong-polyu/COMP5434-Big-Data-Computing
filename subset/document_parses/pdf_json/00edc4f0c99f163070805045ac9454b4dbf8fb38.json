            "text": "The review tool consisted of two main parts: methods design categorization and full review. The review tool and guidance categorizes policy causal inference designs based on the structure of their assumed counterfactual. This is assessed through identifying the data structure and comparison(s) being made. There are two main items for this determination: the number of pre-period time points (if any) used to assess pre-policy outcome trends, and whether or not policy regions were compared with non-policy regions. These, and other supporting questions, broadly allowed categorization of methods into cross-sectional, pre/post, interrupted time series (ITS), difference-in-differences (DiD), comparative interrupted time-series (CITS), (randomized) trials, or other. Given that most papers have several analyses, reviewers were asked to focus exclusively on the impact evaluation analysis that was used as the primary support for the main conclusion of the article. Studies categorized as cross-sectional, pre/post, randomized controlled trial designs, and other were set aside for no further review for the purposes of this research. Cross-sectional and pre-post designs were considered inappropriate for policy causal inference for COVID-19 due largely to inability to account for a large number of potential issues, including confounding, epidemic trends, and selection biases. Randomized controlled trials were assumed to broadly meet key design checks. Studies categorized as \"other\" received no further review, as the review guidance would be unable to assess them. Additional justification and explanation for this decision is available in the review guidance.",

A study could be excellent on all dimensions except for one, and that one dimension could render it inappropriate for causal inference. As such, in addition to the overall rating question, we also generated a \"weakest link\" metric for overall assessment, representing the lowest rating among the four key questions (graphical representation, functional form, timing of policy impact, and concurrent changes).

However, using three reviewers, rather than the originally registered two, meant that most Kappa statistics would not be appropriate for our review process.
