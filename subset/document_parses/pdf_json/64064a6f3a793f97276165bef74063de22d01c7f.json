Physical stamina is necessary for many working dogs. During exercise, these dogs must maintain physiologic homeostasis and mental acuity for prolonged periods of time. The most common physical stresses that impact performance are environmental temperatures, particularly heat stress and the physical wear and tear of high impact activity. Hydration is a critical factor in maintaining function and reducing the risk of heat injury (1) . In a study of tracking dogs in the desert, the median working body temperature was 41C (106F) (Niedermeyer et al.). Dogs receiving electrolyte solutions or flavored water had increased fluid consumption compared to dogs receiving plain water. No adverse effects of electrolyte solutions were observed, however, chicken-flavored water without electrolytes was associated with increased markers of muscle injury.",

A group of nine hunting dogs in Italy were monitored over time to determine the effect of training, hunting and off-season rest on fecal stress markers and the microbiota (Zannoni et al.). Training and hunting did not detectably alter most of the stress markers, and only transiently impacted the microbiota, suggesting that this cycle of activity was only mildly to moderately stressful.",

The carpus and stifle were most commonly associated with reduced range of motion, whereas pain was most commonly found in the hip joint.

In a comprehensive review, Zink and Schlehr synthesized published data with expert observations to systematically describe the critical relationship between structure and function of the canine musculoskeletal system. Further research and understanding of the link between form and both skill and injury will be vital to improving performance and longevity of working dogs. Some of the common structural abnormalities in working dogs involve the lower back and pelvis. Even with normal structure, the repeated motion of jumping up onto raised surfaces or standing on the hind limbs to search elevated locations can put strain on the low back. Computed tomography was used to retrospectively evaluate the pelvis and lumbosacral spine in two different working breeds. The sacral iliac joint, which is the connection between the pelvis and spine, was evaluated for lesions in a retrospective study of 22 working Labrador retrievers by Carnevale et al., The methodology may be useful for future minimally invasive evaluations of working dogs with low back pain. Computed tomographic images of working military German Shepherd and Belgian Malinois lumbar vertebra were compared (Dragicevich et al.), the German Shepherd dogs had a higher incidence of both funnel-shaped lumbar vertebral foramina and articular process dysplasia malformations which may be associated with low back pain.",

When a precipitous drop in performance was noted, instead of simply moving on, they investigated the cause which revealed that an easily missed difference in the processing of urine samples (whether a \"dip stick\" for urinalysis was placed in the sample) was aiding the dogs in the initial training. This highlights the importance of controlling every step along sample collection and processing as well as a constant evaluation of ongoing performance.

Dogs that made a stop and stare alert showed more differentiation in sampling times between sample types (e.g., targets and non-targets) than did dogs that made a sit response. Continuing in the series of investigations on important methodological variables DeChant et al. evaluated the effect of each handler's knowledge level for the search task on team performance metrics. When handlers had more information about the number of targets to find, and whether certain areas may be \"blank, \" search behavior changed compared to teams without such knowledge. Teams spent more time searching and the dog more time looking back toward the handler when they had less knowledge of the search compared to teams that had more knowledge.

This review will likely become a critical reference material for those interested in starting detection canine research. Similarly, Simon et al. provide a thorough review of the types of canine training aids. Training aids are the odor sources used for detection dogs. In many circumstances, the target material dogs are trained to detect (e.g., explosives) maybe too dangerous for frequent training. Therefore, the relevant odor needs to be presented in a safe and reliable manner and this extensive review highlights the varying approaches and limitations of each. As the use of detection dogs extends into new areas (biohazard detection such as COVID-19 or detection of critically endangered animals) methods to collect and store relevant target odorants will become of greater importance, and this review is a great starting point to learn about the benefits and limitations of each training aid technology.",
