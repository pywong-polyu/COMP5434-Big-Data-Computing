            "text": "Social and spatial network analysis is an important approach for investigating infectious disease transmission, especially for pathogens transmitted directly between individuals or via environmental reservoirs. Given the diversity of ways to construct networks, however, it remains unclear how well networks constructed from different data types effectively capture transmission potential. We used empirical networks from a population in rural Madagascar to compare social network survey and spatial data-based networks of the same individuals. Close contact and environmental pathogen transmission pathways were modelled with the spatial data. We found that naming social partners during the surveys predicted higher close-contact rates and the proportion of environmental overlap on the spatial data-based networks. The spatial networks captured many strong and weak connections that were missed using social network surveys alone. Across networks, we found weak correlations among centrality measures (a proxy for superspreading potential). We conclude that social network surveys provide important scaffolding for understanding disease transmission pathways but miss contact-specific heterogeneities revealed by spatial data. Our analyses also highlight that the superspreading potential of individuals may vary across transmission modes. We provide detailed methods to construct networks for close-contact transmission pathogens when not all individuals simultaneously wear GPS trackers.",

Identifying heterogeneities in the contact patterns among host individuals is important for controlling infectious disease transmission, as this heterogeneity influences superspreading and outbreak size [2] [3] [4] [5] . The construction and analysis of networks provide a powerful and increasingly used approach to investigate disease transmission pathways [2] [3] [4] [5] . In contrast with compartmental models, network models take into account non-random, heterogeneous contacts between individuals [2, 6] . Despite the interest in applying network science to investigate disease transmission, however, few studies have considered the types of data to use in generating networks [7, 8] , which can include survey questions, spatiotemporal data or proximity loggers. To capture disease transmission, the sampling methods should capture contact patterns that are relevant to the transmission mode of the infectious organism.",

These interactions may include observed or reported contact events, proxies for contact such as common membership in a social group, or spatio-temporal overlap [9] . The 'importance' of an individual for infectious disease transmission can be assessed using various measures of centrality, which capture the number of connections an individual has (degree centrality), their connections to other highly connected individuals (eigenvector centrality) and their ability to connect disparate parts of the network (betweenness centrality) [10, 11] . An individual's infection risk and superspreading potential can be quantified by their centrality, with high-centrality individuals having greater risk [4, 5, 12, 13] . Other network measures consider the overall structure of the network, such as modularity as a measure of population subdivision [14] , which affects the potential for a pathogen to successfully transmit throughout the network [15] [16] [17] .",

Some of these pathogens are transmitted by close contact between humans, while others are environmentally transmitted through indirect contact with infected domesticated animals, wildlife or their waste products. For example, the risk of Leptospira transmission is greater in flooded rice fields, probably because of the environmental transmission of this water-borne bacterium [26] .

Transmission via close contact encompasses pathogens transmitted person to person via aerosols, droplets and shared body fluids. We based our close-contact network on the probability of a dyad ( pair of social contacts) coming into proximity and the probable amount of time they were in proximity. Environmental transmission refers to organisms that can be acquired through contact with environmental substrates, such as soil or water, or fomites on surfaces in homes, schools or places of worship. We used networks based on shared land use to identify potential transmission pathways of environmentally transmitted organisms. These networks assume that if a pathogen is transmitted through an environmental reservoir, then people who are in contact with the same environmental substrate are likely to be in contact with the same pathogens it contains as a function of time spent in that area [27] . Furthermore, when the transmission mechanism of a pathogen is unknown, information concerning where infected individuals are overlapping in space is key to identifying the source of an outbreak and beginning to understand the pathogen's mode of transmission [28, 29] .",

While spatial data can identify potential transmission events based on the physical proximity of individuals during a given time period, survey-based networks also have the potential to capture contact patterns, and thus potential pathogen transmission, based on the questions about who an individual contacts and in which circumstances. This may be important because GPS tracker data are time-consuming to collect and often lack social context [30] . In addition, GPS-based data require a variety of assumptions and analytical approaches to analyse. For example, when two individuals wear tracker devices at different times, it is no longer possible to simply quantify their time in proximity from the GPS coordinates and timestamps; instead, other sources of data and assumptions are needed to estimate the contact rate of that dyad.",

We also predicted that reciprocal naming on the survey, where both individuals in the dyad named each other on any of the questions, would predict higher edge weights on the other networks.

We created the boundary by calculating the minimum convex polygon (MCP) [37] for all GPS data from 90% to 100% in 0.5% to 0.01% increments using ade-habitatHR::mcp.area [38] . This resulted in a 63.1 km 2 sized grid with 10 m 2 cells that included 94.64% (584 871/617 968) of the recorded locations. To account for days when participants did not wear the GPS (i.e. left the tracker at home), we calculated the daily 99% MCP and excluded days for which the entire 99% MCP fell within 1 ha, based on two assumptions: (i) everyone leaves their house regularly to access water for bathing, outdoor latrines and agricultural land outside the village (K Kauffman & CS Werner 2019, personal observation); (ii) studying the trajectories of individuals with less than 1 ha MCP, we found that they followed a 'starburst' pattern, indicating that the total area was likely to be the result of the scatter of inaccurate GPS points. This resulted in the removal of 26.4% (154 675/584 871) of the remaining data points. This resulted in a dataset containing 123 individuals (7503 dyads) and 1115 days of GPS data with a mean of 9.1 \u00b1 6.3 days (2.1 \u00b1 1.2 weeks) of GPS data per individual (range 1-28 days, 1-6 weeks).",

We chose to use VI instead of the UD overlap index because it is better suited to non-uniformly distributed UDs with a high degree of overlap. We assumed for the overlap calculations that individuals had similar UDs week to week and used the entirety of each individual's GPS data to calculate their UD. We tested this assumption using 14 individuals for whom we had more than 10 days of GPS data spanning at least three weeks by calculating a UD for each week that the individual wore a GPS and computing the VI of their home range (95% UD) between weeks for each individual. We found that the mean VI from week to week of all these individuals (n = 14) was 66.68% \u00b1 6.74%.",

The observed close-contact rate between individuals wearing a GPS at the same time only provided a snapshot of the full network because different sets of individuals wore devices each week and therefore unobserved edges could reflect unobserved contacts (e.g. either or both individuals were not wearing a GPS during a contact) or true absences.

Rice fields and water sources are permanent, although there may be slight seasonal variation in their size. Additional training samples were then created for each of seven land-use categories ( primary forest, secondary forest, rice, brushy regrowth, village, water and bare ground) and were used to perform supervised classification of the rest of the landscape using a support vector machine model in ArcGIS Pro (v. 2.5.0). An accuracy assessment performed on the pre-converted raster showed 84% accuracy (\u03ba = 0.785, n = 500 points generated from stratified random sampling). We also verified accuracy by investigating the land-type composition using polygons created by visiting discrete land-cover areas (i.e. a rice field or secondary forest patch) and creating GPS traces of their perimeter.

A model containing edges, the undirected full naming network, if their naming was reciprocated, house distance, GWESP and GWNSP had a 16.2 point lower AIC. However, the edge predictions were highly correlated with those of the model not containing the naming data (Spearman's \u03c1 = 0.97222, p < 0.001; electronic supplementary material, table S1), so we used the model without naming data in further analyses. Proximity was best explained by the GLM that included the cube root of the VI of the home ranges (95%), the cube root of the VI of the core-use area (50%), the distance between individuals' houses and the gender match term. Models (n = 3) containing the above predictors and either the difference in age between individuals, if individuals lived within 25 m of each other, or the number of times individuals named each other also had substantial support (\u0394AIC < 2). The chosen model was the simplest, and all predictors were present in all the other models with substantial support.

Given that participants work GPS trackers at different times, we inferred close contacts (ii.A) using a pseudo-hurdle model (ii.B) where the probability of edge presence was determined using an ERGM and edge weight was determined using a GLM. We also calculated an environmental overlap network (iii) by first classifying land cover based on GPS imagery (iii.A). We calculated the proportion of time that each person spent in a given grid cell of a given land-cover class (iii.B). We then used these data to create a bipartite network of all shared spaces (iii.C), as well as a sub-network of flooded rice field co-use to demonstrate land-cover specific overlap. Finally, we calculated the unipartite projection for each of these environmental overlap networks. Eigenvector (E), betweenness (B) and strength (S) centrality were calculated on all GPS-based networks. Pagerank (P) centrality replaced eigenvector centrality on the naming network to account for edge directionality.

Our study shows that the networks based on surveys are not perfectly comparable to GPS-derived networks based on close contacts and shared space use. We found only weak, positive correlations between centrality metrics on the different networks, and individuals exhibiting the highest centralities often differ across networks, suggesting that predictions for superspreading potential would also vary [4, 5, 12, 13 ]. Yet we also discovered that naming and reciprocal naming within a dyad predicted significantly higher edge weights in the corresponding close-contact and entire environmental overlap networks (figure 2), demonstrating that some signatures of strong connections based on social surveys also predict transmission-relevant overlap. The connections identified in the social network were important on the close-contact and environmental transmission potential networks. However, the structure of these networks was not fully captured using the social network surveys owing to many missed strong and weak connections. The structural differences between these networks highlight the importance of GPS tracker data to capture direct interactions between people and indirect interactions via the co-use of spaces that are relevant to pathogen transmission [63, 66] .",

We found that individuals with a high degree of overlap who did not name each other were more closely associated with each other spatially, as measured by a high VI of their coreuse areas (50% UD) and living closer together. We expect transmission potential within a household to be high and thus within-household edge weights in all our networks to be higher. However, given the density of homes in the village and the accuracy of the GPS tracking devices we used, it is likely that we also imputed that neighbours had a higher edge weight on the close-contact network and the entire environmental overlap network. Reflecting on these findings given the name-generating questions we asked (table 2), we suspect that participants were not naming individuals in their household because the questions asked about circumstances in which cohabitants would likely be in the same circumstance as the participant and therefore not someone they would go to or would come to them for help. Furthermore, participants might not have listed household members as people with whom they spend their free time, instead of naming friends outside of the home.",

Furthermore, participants' descriptions of interaction strength are influenced by their perceptions, as shown by the low reciprocity on our full naming network (0.43), which is a common phenomenon on social networks [67] . Spatio-temporal data-based network studies are limited in that participants need to simultaneously wear trackers, and the fix rate, or the resolution of the tracker, needs to be extremely precise to capture true contacts (see [42] ). We were able to expand the time frame in which GPS tracker data can be used by implementing spatial ecology methods to estimate where individuals are likely to be located. The resulting close-contact network was much denser and less modular than the full naming network. Likewise, the entire environmental overlap network and flooded rice field overlap networks were also denser and less modular. The potential 'superspreaders' on these networks (e.g. high-centrality individuals) were mostly different across networks, with 18.7% (23/123) of individuals being identified as a superspreader regardless of the centrality metric used on more than one network.",

To overcome this, we assumed no seasonal variation in our study period and that individuals exhibited regular movements, or high fidelity, from week to week, which we tested and found support for by comparing the VI of individuals' home ranges between weeks [41] . However, in doing so, we introduced more uncertainty into our GPS-based networks.

Our exclusion method based on the area traversed in a calendar day potentially excluded days from our analysis when the participant was wearing the GPS device and truly not moving from their house. However, based on observations of daily routines in rural Madagascar, we are comfortable assuming everyone leaves their house daily and were able to validate this by identifying a 'starburst' pattern in GPS tracks from those days, indicating the total area was likely to be due to the scatter of inaccurate GPS points. In addition, a mismatch may occur between the naming and GPS-based networks because we collected GPS data during a single season and participants probably did not limit the people they named during the survey to the same time frame. Lastly, we only had data on about 10% of adults living in the village and no children, who have been identified in other studies as playing an important role in close-contact transmission [68] .",

The many strong and weak connections that are missed when using survey data alone are likely to be important to pathogen community structure and transmission. Thus, social network surveys provide context to understanding disease transmission pathways but do not substitute for spatial data.
