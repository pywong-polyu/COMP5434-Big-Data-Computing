They noted that these patients had features similar to infantile respiratory distress syndrome, and that they did not respond to standard treatment. Over the years, many different definitions for Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) have been proposed, with the American European Consensus Conference (AECC) most commonly used in the past and the Berlin definition (Table 26 .1) being the most commonly used presently. The Berlin definition of ARDS was published in 2012 and was endorsed by the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), the American Thoracic Society (ATS), and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) [2] . They defined ARDS as new or worsening respiratory symptoms within 1 week of clinical insult with bilateral opacities on CXR (Fig. 26 .1) or computerized tomography (CT) scan ( Fig. 26. 2), not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload. They further classified ARDS into three categories (Table 26. 2) based on the arterial oxygen tension: fractional inspired oxygen ratio (PaO 2 /FiO 2 ) and with a minimum positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5. The Berlin definition is notably different from prior definitions in that it recognizes that a CT scan can be used in lieu of a chest radiograph, acknowledges that diagnosis can occur in the presence of cardiac failure, and includes a minimum PEEP of 5 cm H 2 O (or CPAP for mild ARDS). The Berlin definition simplifies the prior definition by removing the classification of acute lung injury (ALI) and instead utilizing mild, moderate, and severe ARDS classifications. These classifications remain important to the definition of ARDS due to differences in mortality, as well as treatment options.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 228, "end": 231, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 874, "end": 877, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 605, "end": 614, "text": "(Table 26", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}, {"start": 1004, "end": 1012, "text": "(Fig. 26", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1056, "end": 1064, "text": "Fig. 26.", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1178, "end": 1188, "text": "(Table 26.", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Many studies have investigated the incidence of ARDS in acute respiratory failure.

The exudative phase occurs within 1-7 days after the initial insult to the lung. The initial insult may be a direct insult to the alveolar epithelium (pneumonia) or an indirect insult such as pancreatitis. This phase is characterized by immune cell-mediated damage of the alveolar capillary endothelial cells and alveolar epithelial cells. The result is a loss of the alveolar barrier and accumulation of protein-rich edema with the formation of a protein-rich hyaline membrane. Alveolar M1 macrophages secrete cytokines (IL-1, 6, 8, and 10), tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and lipid mediators. In response to these proinflammatory cytokines, neutrophils are recruited to the area [9] as well as activation of alveolar epithelial cells and effector T-cells, which leads to sustained inflammation and tissue injury [10] . The resulting inflammatory exudate directly affects type II alveolar cells, leading to inactivation of surfactant and impairment of alveolar function.

Research by Amato and colleagues [21] uses this concept to suggest that tidal volumes based on ideal body weight (IBW) is a reflection of the lung volume of healthy individuals and does not take into account that the functional lung of a patient with ARDS is significantly reduced (baby lung). They suggest that taking into account the lower respiratory-system compliance (C RS ) of the functional lung as a ratio of the lung volume based on IBW (V T ) provides a better prediction for outcomes. They define this ratio as the driving pressure (\u0394P = V T /C RS ), which can be calculated at the bedside as the plateau pressure minus positive end-expiratory pressure (Pplat \u2212 PEEP). They reviewed 3500 patients from nine different trials and concluded that there was a higher mortality rate associated with patients with higher driving pressures.
