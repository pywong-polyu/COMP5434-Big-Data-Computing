This means that those not engaging can be presented as having a moral failing or a lack of civic awareness. In terms of the 'battle' against COVID-19, the expectation is that everyone will do their utmost to prevent its spread, and dire warnings, accompanied by daily death rates, will serve to sustain pressure to submit to increased surveillance. Social shaming regarding the lock-down conditions is already evident, encouraged and actively promoted by the media [32] . Social media is further increasing the pressure, and includes trolling, and other forms of online abuse, aimed at those perceived to question government requests.",
