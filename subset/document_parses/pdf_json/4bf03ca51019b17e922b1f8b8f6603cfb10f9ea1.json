            "text": "The recent novel coronavirus outbreak that occurred in Wuhan, China at the end of 2019 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus with the disease termed COVID-19. COVID-19 has become pandemic and is causing a global health and economic crisis. 1 As of November 2021, COVID-19 is considered to be a respiratory infectious disease that causes severe pneumonia associated with symptoms such as cough, fever, fatigue, sputum production and/or shortness of breath resulting in death in many individuals. [2] [3] [4] COVID-19 has caused more than 5 million deaths worldwide so far (https:// covid19.who.int). However, most people with COVID- 19 have mild or no symptoms. 5 Factors such as age (>60), sex (male>female) and/or existing health conditions (e.g., respiratory/cardiovascular diseases and diabetes) have been reported to exacerbate the degree of symptoms and depress survival rate. However, there are severe cases where patients succumb to despite not having any of these underlying complicating factors. 3, 6, 7 Human host genetic differences may account for the disparities in COVID-19 severity. To identify such genetic differences, a number of research projects using COVID-19 patients' DNA and plasma/ serum have begun worldwide mainly via genome-wide association studies (GWAS; e.g., the COVID-19 Host Genetics Initiative, https://www.covid19hg.org and the COVID Human Genetic Effort, https://www.covidhge. com), which led to identification of COVID-19-susceptible patients who carry risk variants in coding regions of type I IFN pathway genes (3.5% among the susceptible patients) and who develop autoantibodies against type I IFNs (10.2% among the susceptible patients), 8, 9 indicating lack of proper type I IFN responses exaggerates COVID-19 disease severity.",

However, the recent development of CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome editing technology has enabled researchers to assess the gene-regulatory functions, if any, of such non-coding regions. Especially, an epigenome editor CRISPRi (a modified CRISPR/Cas9 in which dCas9-KRAB repressor transcriptionally represses the activity of gene-regulatory regions that are selected by sgRNA [single guide RNA]) has been shown to be useful to identify functional gene-regulatory regions at a genomic level using blood, kidney and prostate cell lines.

Using this new CRISPRi approach, we previously identified genes regulated by such non-coding regions that harbour specific SNPs linked to chronic lung diseases,",

In fact, the sn/scRNA-seq data indicated that the MDA5/ RAVER-ICAM1 pathway was activated in alveolar lung epithelial AT2 cells of mild-moderate COVID-19 cases in monkeys but not in those of severe COVID-19 cases in humans. Early detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus by frequent PCR testing and, if positive, early intervention by antibody-therapy targeting the virus may be beneficial for patients that carry SNPs rs11385942 and/or rs74956615 risk alleles.

            "text": "CRISPRi was performed as described previously 18, 19 except that gRNA (guide RNA) sequences were designed to target regions near SNPs that were significantly associated with COVID-19 disease severity independent of ATAC accessibility and the presence of histone gene-regulatory marks (H3K27ac, H3K4me1, H3K4me2, H3K4me3 and H3K9me3). Briefly, gRNA target sequences were designed using CRISPOR 20 and synthetic sgRNAs (single gRNA) were generated using the Invitrogen custom TrueGuide gRNA ordering tool (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA). Non-targeted synthetic sgRNA was used as a negative control (cat#A35526, Thermo Fisher). A lentiviral vector harbouring CRISPR/dCas9-KRAB was obtained from Addgene (pLV hU6-sgRNA hUbC-dCas9-KRAB-T2a-Puro; Plasmid #71236). 21 A lentiviral vector that carries dCas9-KRAB and sgRNA that targets a region near rs11385942 was made using DNA oligos obtained from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA). Lentivirus was produced using the lentiviral vectors at the Viral Vector Core at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center (CCHMC). A549 and H1793 lung epithelial (carcinoma) cell lines that were obtained from ATCC (Manassas, VA), identification of which were validated by Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings (Burlington, NC), were used to generate cell lines that stably express dCas9-KRAB alone or dCas9-KRAB+sgRNA using the lentiviruses described above by puromycin selection (10 ug/ml at the final concentration). The absence of mycoplasma was confirmed using Universal Mycoplasma Detection Kit (cat#30-1012K, ATCC). The cell lines that express dCas9-KRAB were transfected with synthetic sgRNAs (50 nM final concentration) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (cat#13778075, Thermo Fisher). Two days after transfection, RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (cat#15596018, Thermo Fisher) and cDNA was made from the RNA using iScript TM Reverse Transcription Supermix for Real-Time (RT)-qPCR (cat#1708841, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). TaqMan RT-qPCR gene expression analysis (Thermo Fisher) was performed using the cDNA to assess mRNA expression according to the manufacturer's protocol using probes (Hs01890924 for CCR9, Hs00373589 for DPP9, Hs00365407 for FDX2, Hs01089321 for FYCO1, Hs02758991 for GAPDH, Hs00913466 for ICAM3, Hs00175123 for IL10RB, Hs01066116 for IFNAR1, Hs01022060 for IFNAR2, Hs01118910 for LARS2, Hs00170931 for LIMD1, Hs00947898 for LZTFL1, Hs00211043 for MRPL4, Hs00384077 for MYDGF, Hs00973637 for OAS1, Hs00942643 for OAS2, Hs00196324 for OAS3, Hs00913477 for RAVER1, Hs01080325 for SACM1L, Hs00610960 for SLC6A20, Hs00177464 for TYK2, Hs00913460 for ZGLP1).

The following 5 COVID-19 donors with ages between 30 and 60 (patient number: D3, D4, D10, D12, D15) were included in our analysis. Cell selection and associated cell type annotations were obtained from the original study. 24, 25 For normal human lung data, the \"celltype\" annotation was used 24 ; 473 cells annotated as \"Unclassified\" were excluded. For COVID-19 human lung data, the \"predicted_celltype\" annotation was used 25 ; 271 cells without predicted annotation were excluded. In total, the snRNA-seq of 9,920 cells from 3 normal lungs and 27,792 cells from 5 COVID-19 lungs were used for downstream analysis. To increase the number of common cell types in the normal and COVID-19 cell type assignments, some cell sub-types were merged as follows: for the normal lung data, vascular endothelial cell subtypes (Cap1, Cap2, veins and arteries), fibroblast cell subtypes (matrix fibroblast 1 and 2) and macrophage cell subtypes (alveolar and interstitial macrophages) were merged; for the COVID-19 data, monocyte cell subsets (\"CD16+ monocyte\" and \"monocyte\") and T cell subsets (\"CD4+ T cell, \"CD8+ T cell\" and \"Treg\") were merged. For the additional validation study, processed data (UMI matrix and cell metadata) of snRNA-seq of COVID-19 (n=19) and control (n=7) human lungs (age 58-84) of Columbia cohort 26 were downloaded from GSE171524 (https://www.ncbi. nlm.nih.gov/geo/).

            "text": "To determine whether loci that were identified by GWAS as linked to COVID-19 disease severity function as gene-regulatory regions, we used a CRISPRi approach focused on lung epithelial cells. Lung epithelial cells are critical cell types for COVID-19 pathogenesis. 32 Therefore, we used lung epithelial cell lines that stably express dCas9-KRAB repressor that we previously created. 18 We first analysed a locus harbouring rs11385942 to determine whether the locus functions as a gene-regulatory region since this locus has the highest significance linked with COVID-19 disease severity 10 . CRISPRi can repress the transcriptional activity of a genomic region by targeting the corresponding region with sgRNA (single guide RNA) along with a dCas9-KRAB repressor. 21 Using the CRISPOR tool, 20 we found a highly specific and efficient sgRNA target sequence (yellow highlighted) near rs11385942 at intron 5 of LZTFL1 at chromosome locus 3p21.21 ( Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S1a) . As previously performed, 18 we transfected synthetic sgRNA targeting the locus in dCas9-KRAB-expressing A549 lung epithelial cells and conducted gene expression analysis assessing the expression of nearby genes, including LARS2, LIMD1, SACM1L, LZTFL1, CCR9 and FYCO1, located at chromosome locus 3p21.21. Notably, the expression of LZTFL1 but no other nearby lung epithelial genes was significantly repressed by the targeted sgRNA (1.5fold, P=0.0121, two-sided Student's t-test; Fig. 1b) . To validate the result obtained using synthetic sgRNA, we also produced lentivirus carrying both target sgRNA and dCas9-KRAB and infected A549 cells with the lentivirus and assessed the expression of the genes mentioned above. The results using A549 cells with the lentivirus were consistent with the results using synthetic sgRNA (1.5-fold, P=0.0036, two-sided Student's t-test; Supplementary Fig. S1b ). Since A549 cells do not express endogenous SLC6A20, we repeated the same CRISPRi experiment using H1793 lung epithelial cells that express endogenous SLC6A20, 33 which indicated that the expression of only LZTFL1 but no other nearby lung epithelial genes, including SLC6A20, was significantly affected by the sgRNA targeting the locus (1.5fold, P=0.0041, two-sided Student's t-test; Supplementary Fig. S1c) . These results indicate that the locus with rs11385942 affects the expression of LZTFL1 and may in turn influence COVID-19 severity. LZTFL1 regulates airway ciliogenesis (Fig. 1c) , 34 which is critical for virus clearance from airways, suggesting insufficient SARS-CoV-2 virus clearance in airways with patients carrying rs11385942 risk allele may lead to the progression of COVID-19 disease severity.",

Notably, an sgRNA targeting a locus (yellow highlighted) near rs74956615 significantly repressed the expression of RAVER1 but no other lung epithelial genes expressed in A549 cells, including MRPL4, ZGLP1, FDX2, ICAM3 and TYK, located at chromosome 19p13.2 (1.5-fold, P=0.0050, two-sided Student's t-test; Fig. 2b ), suggesting that the locus with rs74956615 influences the expression of RAVER1 and in turn impacts the development of critical illness in COVID-19. RAVER1 is a coactivator of MDA5 (IFIH1), which recognizes nucleic acids associated with viral infections such as dsRNAs, including SARS-CoV-2, and activates antiviral response genes, including IFNB1, ICAM1, TNF and CCL5 (Fig. 2c) , 35 suggesting that the MDA5 (IFIH1) antiviral pathway may be modified in patients carrying rs74956615 risk allele, which results in critical illness. The sgRNAs targeting other loci, including rs2109069, rs6489867, rs10735079 and rs2236757, did not affect the expression of nearby genes 1.5 or more-fold (Supplementary Figs. S3-S5).",

Notably, among the MDA5/ RAVER1 pathway-related genes, ICAM1 (but not IFNB1, TNF and CCL5), which is a downstream gene of MDA5 (IFIH1)/RAVER1, 35 was significantly reduced in alveolar AT1/AT2 lung epithelial cells of COVID-19-succumbed human lungs compared to healthy lungs ( Fig. 3a and b,  Supplementary Table S1 ), the data of which was consistent with additional analysis of another snRNAseq dataset obtained from COVID-19-succumbed lungs, 26 albeit lower fold probably due to age 58 (up to 84) population dataset (Supplementary Table S2 ). ICAM1 (Intercellular adhesion molecule-1) in alveolar lung epithelial cells enhances adherence of neutrophils to alveolar lung epithelial cells upon lung inflammation, 37 suggesting that the antiviral MDA5/RAVER1 pathway driving ICAM1-mediated lung neutrophil/epithelial interaction is critical in severely affected COVID-19 lungs.",

The monkey datasets provide scRNA-seq data of lungs from monkeys infected with irradiated (3 days post infection [3 dpi]; control) and live SARS-CoV-2 (3 dpi or 10 dpi). 28 Using unbiased clustering analysis, we were able to separate lung epithelial populations, including AT1 and AT2 cells, from the monkey lungs infected with SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. S6 and Table S3 ). Representative gene markers that define distinct cell populations are shown in Fig. 4b . Notably, differential gene expression analysis indicated that MDA5 (IFIH1) was significantly induced 3 days after SARS-CoV-2 experimental infection (3 dpi; Figs. 4c and 4d, Supplementary Fig. S7 and Table S3 ) and ICAM1 was significantly induced 10 days after the infection in alveolar AT2 lung epithelial cells (10 dpi; Fig. 4e and f, Supplementary Fig. S7 and Table S3 ), suggesting that the antiviral MDA5/RAVER-ICAM1 pathway is activated in alveolar AT2 lung epithelial cells of SARS-CoV-2-resistant monkeys.",

[8] [9] [10] [11] [12] However, since most of these loci are located at non-coding regions, it has been difficult to determine which neighbouring genes are affected by the SNP-containing loci. The expression of genes which are affected by these loci needs to be identified to develop therapeutic approaches that can target corresponding genes using drugs. In the present study, using CRISPRi and sn/scRNA-seq analyses, we identified LZTFL1 and RAVER1 that are expressed in airway ciliated cells and alveolar AT2 lung epithelial cells, respectively, as genes whose expression is affected by the loci that were identified by GWAS to be associated with COVID-19 severity.",

In order to understand the role of the COVID-19 GWAS locus in blood cells that carry multiple variants, including SNP rs11385942, on LZTFL1 at chromosome locus 3p21.21, Yao et al. deleted this portion of LZTFL1 using a genome editor CRISPR/Cas9 in blood cell lines and found that the expression of CCR9 and SLC6A20 was affected by the locus, 38 suggesting that this COVID-19 GWAS locus at chromosome locus 3p21.21 may influence different genes depending on cell type. Other COVID-19 GWAS loci, which did not affect the expression of neighbouring genes according to our present analysis using lung epithelial cell lines, may influence their expression in non-lung epithelial cells, including blood cells. In order to precisely assess the roles of COVID-19-associated SNPs, the creation of different types (e.g., epithelia or blood) of cell lines and/ or the culture of primary cells that carry non-risk or risk alleles is required, which allows assessment of whether the expression of COVID-19-relevant genes are affected by risk alleles in different cell types even in the presence or absence of SARS-CoV-2. Of note, we designed our sgRNA sequences independently of conventional histone gene-regulatory marks and ATAC accessibility considering our previous experience that a portion of transcription factors can access ATAC-inaccessible regions, 19 suggesting that assessing GWAS loci in an agnostic approach may lead to the identification of previously unrecognized gene-regulatory regions.",

            "text": "Our present study analysing COVID-19 GWAS loci led to the identification of LZTFL1 and RAVER1 as influencing COVID-19 disease severity. As our sn/scRNAseq data and the data from others indicate, LZTFL1 is highly expressed in ciliated cells, including airway ciliated cells, and regulates ciliogenesis and ciliary function. 34, 36, 39 Since the reduced expression of LZTFL1 leads to fewer airway ciliated cells with shorter cilia, 34 patients who carry SNP rs11385942 risk allele may lose LZTFL1 expression rapidly upon SARS-CoV-2 virus infection. This can result in inefficient airway viral clearance by weakened cilia and in turn spur the accumulation of more SARS-CoV-2 virus in the lung leading to severe COVID-19 disease (Fig. 5a) . Likewise, ageing has been shown to weaken airway ciliary function that leads to more frequent respiratory infection, 40 which may also explain increased critical COVID-19 cases in elderly populations. Our analyses of sn/scRNA-seq datasets also indicate that RAVER1 along with its interacting In human alveolar AT2 lung epithelial cells that are infected with SARS-CoV-2, MDA5 (IFIH1) associated with its coactivator RAVER1 senses double-stranded RNA produced by SARS-CoV-2 and induces ICAM1 that recruits neutrophils to AT2 cells to combat SARS-CoV-2. In human AT2 cells that lack the proper antiviral mechanism mediated by MDA5 (IFIH1) due to insufficient RAVER1 (e.g., rs74956615 risk allele), ICAM1 may not be induced properly upon SARS-CoV-2 infection, thereby allowing the accumulation of SARS-CoV-2 in lung alveolar regions lacking sufficient neutrophils, causing excessive lung damage. The figure drawings were created with BioRender.com. partner MDA5 (IFIH1) and downstream gene ICAM1 are expressed in lung epithelial cells, including alveolar AT2 cells, which is consistent with the Human Protein Atlas data using healthy lungs (https://www.proteinat las.org/ENSG00000161847-RAVER1/celltype). RAVER1 functions as a co-activator for MDA5 (IFIH1)mediated cellular antiviral responses, in part through neutrophil activation mediated by ICAM1 that is downstream of MDA5/RAVER1. 35, 37, 41 The relatively low expression of RAVER1 in in vivo snRNA-seq datasets compared to the cell lines (https://www.proteinatlas. org/ENSG00000161847-RAVER1/celltype) might be due to the difficulty of obtaining RAVER1-positive cells through the sn/scRNA-seq approach akin to the reported dearth of neutrophils in the sn/scRNA-seq analysis. 25 Patients who carry SNP rs74956615 risk allele may have reduced RAVER1 upon SARS-CoV-2 virus infection and fail to properly activate MDA5-mediated expression of antiviral genes, especially ICAM1, in alveolar AT2 lung epithelial cells. Then, patients with SNP rs74956615 risk allele may accumulate SARS-CoV-2 virus in the lung, especially in the alveolar region, which is important for gas exchange, leading to COVID-19 critical illness (Fig. 5b) . As SARS-CoV-2 antagonizes MDA5 (IFIH1) activation to evade host immunity, MDA5 (IFIH1) has been shown to be critical for antiviral responses against SARS-CoV-2. 42 Notably, children, who are more resistant to SARS-CoV-2 than adults, have elevated MDA5 (IFIH) pathway genes in the upper airways along with activated neutrophils compared to adults, who are more susceptible to SARS-CoV-2. 43 This finding is consistent with our scRNA-seq analyses showing elevated expression of MDA5 (IFIH1) and downstream ICAM1 using the SARS-CoV-2-infected lungs of monkeys that are resistant to SARS-CoV-2 (Fig. 4) . People who harbour risk alleles of SNPs rs11385942 and/or rs74956615 may benefit from early detection of SARS-CoV-2 virus by frequent PCR testing. If positive, immediate treatment using an antibody targeting SARS-CoV-2 (e.g., REGN-COV2) 44 could be beneficial in reducing the level of SARS-CoV-2 virus as soon as possible considering that such people may have weakened ciliary function and/or impaired antiviral pathways, respectively, as indicated by the presence of risk alleles of the SNPs. However, in order to implement such a therapeutic strategy, further in vitro and in vivo studies to delineate the mechanisms will be required, especially considering that a small sample size was used for the present snRNA-seq analysis. Moreover, such diagnosis and associated therapy should be considered after assessing, in a prospective clinical trial, whether a single variant or a polygenic risk score (PRS) is more appropriate as a biomarker based on reliability and feasibility. 45, 46 Our present study using CRISPRi and sn/scRNA-seq datasets identifies possible genes that are functionally affected by the loci determined by GWAS to be associated with COVID-19 disease severity. Our data so far suggest that people who have risk alleles of SNPs rs11385942 and/or rs74956615 may carry impaired antiviral defence systems against SARS-CoV2 virus, thereby accumulating more virus and in turn more severe COVID-19 symptoms. Early detection of the virus by frequent PCR testing and immediate virus targeting therapy for people who carry risk alleles of SNPs rs11385942 and/or rs74956615 may be beneficial. ",
