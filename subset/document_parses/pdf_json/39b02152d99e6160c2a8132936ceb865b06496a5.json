Purpose: To investigate the experiences of undergraduate nursing students during their first uses of OL to increase the understanding of their encountered opportunities and challenges. Design: A descriptive qualitative design guided by a phenomenological approach was used. Methods: The study used a purposive sampling technique to recruit 18 undergraduate nursing students from two universities. Data were collected using two focus group discussions, and the discussions with participants were audio/video recorded through the online platform Zoom due to the national imposed curfew. Content analysis employed Colaizzi's steps to derive the themes/categories. Results: The study revealed four themes: experience of helplessness, burdens, and burnout; the need for social and technical support to manage OL; the propensity to consider OL as a positive opportunity; and the deficiency of OL in fulfilling the educational outcomes of clinical courses. Conclusions: Abrupt remote OL was a challenge to clinical encounters. This format was very stressful; however, it was also useful. The current study highlighted the need for further research on the effectiveness of remote OL platforms in regard to the achievement of the intended learning outcomes of clinical courses.",

On 18th March 2020, the Ministry of Higher Education in Jordan imposed a nationwide lockdown on academic institutions (The Jordan Times, 2020). Nursing educators were obliged to apply remote online teaching/learning (OT/ L) since it was the only choice, although face-to-face education had prevailed throughout the previous years. Teaching approaches became more attuned to students' involvement in the pedagogical process while at home by using global OT/L platforms such as Microsoft Teams, Zoom, the e-learning platforms of their universities or Google Classroom. In this sense, remote OT/L encompasses changes in the role of the students such that they are no longer passive recipients of knowledge, in the responsibility of the teachers such that they are no longer in full control, and in the location of the learning process such that it occurs at home.",

OL emphasizes two settings: home as a place where the student engages in lower order thinking skills, such as knowing and comprehending, through listening to and watching video tutorials (i.e., the perception continuum), and online platform as a place where the student participates in learning activities that foster higher order thinking skills, such as analyzing through engagement in discussions with faculty members and other colleagues while reflecting on and synthesizing information (i.e., the processing continuum).",

Both schools used the credit system approach and follow similar core and nursing specialty courses with few differences related to optional courses. In both schools, each theory specialized nursing course is taught concurrently with its related clinical course, and the clinical training for most courses is conducted at hospitals with few maternal-child health centers and community settings such as homes and schools. During the imposed curfew, both schools utilized an online teaching approach that included detailed video instructions on how to access website platforms such as Zoom or Microsoft Teams through the universities' Moodle accounts. The students in both schools were studying theoretical and clinical courses, including basic, core, specialized, and university required courses. All courses, including the clinical courses, were taught using online approaches with videos, simulations, and case study applications.",

The transcript was analyzed manually by the researchers (N.M. & Z.A.) who coded significant words, statements, or phrases related to the nursing students' OL experiences. A color-coded system was used to highlight significant statements to perform the preliminary analysis. Then, the two authors organized the significant statements into meaningful units that clustered the categorizing codes into themes and integrated the obtained themes related to the students' experiences into an in-depth description of the online learning phenomenon. After the themes were extracted, a discussion session with all research authors was held to reach a consensus on the extracted themes. We analyzed the data simultaneously with the data collection.

Crawford et al. (2020) studied the global first wave responses to the pandemic. They reported a diversity of responses by higher education institutions ranging from no response to rapid curriculum redevelopment for fully online offerings (Crawford et al., 2020) . Similarly, the students in this study, who are accustomed to traditional learning/teaching and were in the middle of a semester, expressed a mixture of feelings regarding this sudden change. Fear of the unknown and uncertainty, helplessness, burdens and burnout at times were expressed by all the students in the current study. Similar emotions were reported by other studies conducted under normal conditions regarding e-learning becoming the main method of teaching (Kenny, 2002; Telford and Senior, 2017) . Kenny (2002) reported the results of several studies indicating that fear, anxiety, frustration and feelings of intimidation were expressed by nursing students when they were confronted with using computers as part of their studies. She added that computer anxiety combined with a lack of skill, which was also reported by students in the current study, affects the learning of students who are exposed to OL (Kenny, 2002) . According to Clark (2015) , picking up a new learning approach and understanding course content at the same time is challenging and demanding for students. Tang et al. (2015) have also indicated that for students who are new to OL, the learning curve will be more drastic and they need time to adapt while more experienced students will have more positive learning experience. Raymond et al. (2016) also noted that even if the students were computer literate and had their own computers, it may be difficult for them to navigate and use programs and software. However, these feelings may have been aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting curfew as this situation is considered a crisis that poses significant psychological burdens on individuals (Chick et al., 2020) .",

In other words, remote OL did not contribute to students' sense of psychological safety in their clinical performance. Dost et al. (2020) indicated that the lack of immediate feedback may lead to the concern that online teaching may compromise the clinical competence and confidence of students. However, Goh and Sandars (2020) visualized that medical students can be remotely coached with real-time mobile video tools and apps and considered this to be a positive effect of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, the evidence derived from the review of McCutcheon et al. (2015) suggests that using online learning to teach clinical skills is as effective as traditional learning in developing the nursing competencies needed for safe practice. However, Dost et al. (2020) noted that students often do not feel completely prepared for their profession.",

Some indicated they did not have their own computers at home; if they did have this resource at home, then they had to share the computers with other siblings and family members who are school students or work from home. Others indicated the financial burden of internet expenses, and many were frustrated by the weak and interrupted connectivity, which made it difficult for them to attend sessions, take quizzes or upload files and assignments. These problems were also reported in the literature (Lo and Hew, 2017; Raymond et al., 2016; Sentiment, 2020; Tang et al., 2015; Wang, 2016) . According to Tang et al. (2015) , technical issues frustrate students and restrain their learning. However, the perception of being unsupported was considered more of an issue than the actual technical difficulty (Hart, 2012) . Hart (2012) indicated that there is almost a consensus in the literature that communication with instructors and peers and family support are important to overcome barriers to learning. Communication and support motivate students' persistence to learn and to succeed in an online course despite hardships. However, the absence of family support may hinder students' learning (Wang, 2016) . Fortunately, most students in the current study reported that their families were supportive. However, some reported distractions due to noise and unconducive learning environments. Three of the female students were married and reported slight conflicts with their spouses who seemed to be unsupportive. This, however, may not be related only to online learning per say; it may also be related to the curfew. The pandemic poses significant psychological burdens on individuals, and spouses may be worried about physical health and consider it to be the most significant concern (Chick et al., 2020) .",
