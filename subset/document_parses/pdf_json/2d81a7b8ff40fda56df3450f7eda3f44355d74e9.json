However, it does not consider that these issues are heavily intertwined. The right to life is the most fundamental human right, with no derogations permissible. Additionally, the right to health is protected under Article 12 of the International Covenant for Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. These strengthen Patel's argument for an independent NHS. Indeed its removal from Government hands would serve to recognise the NHS as a fundamental British institution that protects our health, just as the judiciary protects our rights.",

While the judiciary is independent under the separation of powers, the Supreme Court still rules on extremely prominent political issues. Similarly, the NHS will remain subject to political scrutiny and pressure.",
