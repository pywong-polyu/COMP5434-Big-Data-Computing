J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Contribution of autophagy machinery factors to 1 HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication organelle 2 formation 3 4 Woan-Summary 1 Positive-strand RNA viruses replicate in close association with rearranged 2 intracellular membranes. For hepatitis C virus (HCV) and SARS-CoV-2, these 3 rearrangements comprise ER-derived double membrane vesicles (DMVs) serving 4 as RNA replication sites. Cellular factors involved in DMV biogenesis are poorly 5 defined. Here, we show that despite structural similarity of viral DMVs with 6 autophagosomes, conventional macroautophagy is dispensable for HCV and 7 SARS-CoV-2 replication. However, both viruses exploit factors involved in 8 autophagosome formation, most notably class III phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase 9 (PI3K). As revealed with a biosensor, PI3K is activated in cells infected with either 10 virus to produce PI3P while kinase complex inhibition or depletion profoundly 11 reduces replication and viral DMV formation. The PI3P-binding protein DFCP1 12 recruited to omegasomes in early steps of autophagosome formation, participates in 13 replication and DMV formation of both viruses. These results indicate that 14 phylogenetically unrelated HCV and SARS-CoV-2 exploit similar components of the 15 autophagy machinery to create their replication organelles. 16 17",

In HCV, 71 previous studies show that infection increases the PE-conjugated LC3-II form, 72 indicating autophagy activation (Ait-Goughoulte et al., 2008; Dreux et al., 2009; Sir et 73 al., 2008). In addition, it has been reported that perturbation of the ATG5-12/16L1 74 complex impairs HCV replication and decreases DMV number and size (Dreux et al., 75 2009; Fahmy and Labont\u00e9, 2017; Gu\u00e9vin et al., 2010; Tanida et al., 2009).

Earlier studies suggest that the ATG5-12/16L1 332 complex is required for HCV replication (Dreux et al., 2009; Fahmy et al., 2018; 333 Fahmy and Labont\u00e9, 2017; Gu\u00e9vin et al., 2010; Tanida et al., 2009), which is at 334 variance to our results showing that KO of ATG5 and ATG16L1 does not affect HCV 335 replication. This inconsistency might result from the different approaches used to 336 inhibit ATG proteins. While earlier studies employed siRNA KD, which might have 337 caused insufficient depletion of ATG proteins, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based KO 338 cells unable to express targeted genes. Although during selection for KO cells, we 339 might have enriched for cells compensating the defect, such as upregulation of 340 ATG16L2 replacing ATG16L1 in the complex with ATG5-12 (Ishibashi et al., 2011), 341 we note that two functional assays demonstrated a block of 342 ATG5-12/16L1-dependent autophagy in our cell pools, yet virus replication was not 343 significantly affected. In the case of coronaviruses, the role of ATG5 for viral 344 replication is discussed controversially. Prentice and colleagues report that MHV 345 replication is strongly reduced by ATG5 KO (Prentice et al., 2004a; Prentice et al., used in these studies, but further studies are required to clarify these 350 inconsistencies. 351 By using a biosensor, we found that PI3P levels are upregulated in HCV and 352 SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. This elevation appears to be important for viral 353 replication, because treatment of the cells with the class III PI3K-specific inhibitor 354 PIK-III reduced HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication, consistent with previous studies 355 employing other PI3K inhibitors (Mohl et al., 2016; Silvas et al., 2020; Williams et al., 356 2021; Yuen et al., 2020). However, VPS34 is involved in autophagy and endocytic 357 pathways (Jaber et al., 2016; Juh\u00e1sz et al., 2008), raising the question whether the 358 PI3P we detected resides on autophagy-related membranes directly involved in 359 DMV formation or on endosomal membranes involved in cargo transport to DMV 360 formation sites. Although the role of PI3P in endosomal transport processes such as 361 the delivery of cholesterol to HCV-induced DMVs cannot be excluded (Stoeck et al., 362 2018), our data suggest that PI3P produced by PI3K is directly involved in HCV and 363 SARS-CoV-2 replication. Consistent with this assumption, KD or KO of ATG14L 364 (Lee et al., 2019a) and depletion of Beclin 1 (Figure S2) (Gassen et al., 2021), which 365 are both components of the PI3K complex (Figure 1A), inhibit HCV replication.",

In 381 cells infected with these viruses VPS34 translocates to the replication compartment 382 through interaction with the viral replicase to facilitate replication (Feng et al., 2019). 383 Thus, the host cell pathways studied here might be exploited by multiple 384 positive-strand RNA viruses to create their replication organelles. 385 Previous studies demonstrated that HCV and coronavirus infection increases 386 the abundance of LC3-II in infected cells, although it has not been confirmed whether 387 autophagy flux was enhanced or reduced (Cottam et al., 2011; Dreux et al., 2009; SARS-CoV-2 infected cells and demonstrate upregulation of PI3P as determined 393 with the PI3P-sensor. Sensitivity of this probe for PI3P was validated by the lack of 394 its recruitment when using a PI3P non-binding DFCP1 mutant, arguing against the 395 possibility that the probe was recruited by the DFCP1 moiety independent from 396 PI3P. With respect to HCV, our results are supported by a previous study showing 397 that the PI3K inhibitor 3-methyladenine (3-MA) or VPS34 KD reduce the abundance 398 of LC3-II in HCV infected cells and HCV replication, respectively (Su et al., 2011). In 399 contrast, two other studies report that inhibition of PI3P production neither affects 400 HCV-induced LC3 lipidation, nor DFCP1 puncta formation (Mohl et al., 2016; Sir et 401 al., 2012). One possible explanation for these discrepancies might be the use of 402 different 3-MA treatment durations, ranging from 3 to 40 h between the different 403 studies. Another explanation could be the different assay used to determine HCV 404 replication. 405 In the case of coronaviruses, lipidation or redistribution of LC3 has been 406 described for cells infected with transmissible gastroenteritis virus and infectious 407 bronchitis virus (Cottam et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2016). In contrast, Reggiori and 408 co-workers reported an association between MHV-induced DMVs and non-lipidated 409 LC3 and the importance of non-lipidated LC3 for replication and DMV formation 410 (Reggiori et al., 2010). Since the presence of LC3-I is a marker for ERAD vesicles 411 (Cali et al., 2008a; Cali et al., 2008b), this study suggests that the ERAD pathway, 412 rather than autophagy, is hijacked by MHV for DMV formation. Notably, we did not 413 strategies might be used by different coronaviruses for DMV formation. 415 While we provide evidence that the class III PI3K is required for HCV-and 416 SARS-CoV-2-induced DMV formation, the turn-over of these structures remains 417 unclear. As shown in a recent publication, DMVs induced by MHV are subjected to 418 lysosomal degradation late in infection when the ER becomes the main budding 419 compartment for new virions (Mihelc et al., 2021). At least in the expression-based 420 systems, we neither observed enhanced degradation of HA-nsp3 upon PI3K 421 inhibition (Figure 4E, S6D), nor colocalization with LAMP1 (Figure S6F), arguing 422 against DMV degradation. Further studies will be required to dissect DMV turn-over 423 in the case of SARS-CoV-2. 424 We have recently shown that NS5A, in cooperation with RACK1, facilitates the 425 formation of the class III PI3K complex (Lee et al., 2019a). Here, we further 426 investigated how NS5A affects PI3P production and thus, DMV formation. Inhibition 427 of NS5A by Daclatasvir strongly reduced NS3-5B induced GFP-DFCP1 puncta 428 formation. This effect was specific as PI3P levels were unaffected by Daclatasvir in 429 cells expressing a drug-resistant replicase, indicating that NS5A is involved in 430 HCV-induced PI3P production, consistent with our earlier report showing that 431 Daclatasvir blocks HCV-induced DMV formation. 432 DFCP1 is a PI3P effector protein that, upon starvation, associates with 433 omegasomes (Axe et al., 2008; Nanao et al., 2015). However, the exact function of 434 this protein in autophagy remains unclear. Recent evidence suggests that DFCP1 435 and the ER (Gao et al., 2019; Li et al., 2019). Here, we show that DFCP1 positively 437 regulates HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication, possibly by promoting formation of 438 DMVs, the replication sites of these viruses. We previously observed 439 DMV-decorated ER wrapping around lipid droplets in HCV infected cells (Lee et al., 440 2019b), arguing that DFCP1 might affect DMV formation through regulating the 441 contact between ER and lipid droplets, at least in HCV. Although it is unclear 442 whether the same applies to SARS-CoV-2, we note that lipid droplets have been 443 observed in close proximity of virus particles and it has been proposed that lipid 444 droplets might serve as an assembly platform (Dias et al., 2020). However, we did 445 not observe such proximity of lipid droplets and SARS-CoV-2 particles or DMVs by 446 using various high-resolution imaging techniques (Cortese et al., 2020), although 447 recent reports suggest that inhibition of lipid droplet formation interferes with the 448 SARS-CoV-2 replication cycle (Dias et al., 2020; Williams et al., 2021). Further 449 studies will be required to clarify whether lipid droplets contribute to some specific 450 steps of the SARS-CoV-2 life cycle or are more generally required as lipid or energy 451 source. 452 In conclusion, we show that although ATG5-12/16L1-dependent autophagy is 453 dispensable for HCV and SARS-CoV-2 replication, components of the 454 autophagosome biogenesis machinery such as elements of the PI3K complex and 455 DFCP1 are critically involved in viral replication, most likely by contributing to the 456 formation of DMVs, the viral sites of RNA replication. These results underscore how 457 manner. Identification of commonly used host cell factors might pave the way for 459",

Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells stably expressing the 695 bacteriophage T7 RNA polymerase were cultured in the presence of 5 \u00b5g/ml zeocin, 696 while Huh7-Lunet SGR, Huh7-Lunet/CD81H, and A549/ACE2 cells were maintained 697 in DMEM cplt containing 250 \u00b5g/ml G418. Starvation treatment was achieved by 698 culturing cells in Earle's Balanced Salts (EBSS, Sigma) for 2 h. 699 700 Virus stock production 701 For HCV production, in vitro transcripts of full-length HCV constructs Jc1 or 702 JcR2a (Pietschmann et al., 2006; Poenisch et al., 2015) were transfected into 703Huh7.5 cells by electroporation as described below. Virus was harvested at 48 or 72 704 h post-transfection, filtered through a 0.45 \u03bcm-pore size filter and stored at -70\u00b0C 705 until use. Tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TCID50) was determined as previously 706 described(K\u00e4rber, 1931; Spearman, 1908). Unless stated otherwise, cells were 707 infected with HCV using a MOI of 0.1. 708The SARS-CoV-2 isolate Bavpat1/2020 was kindly provided by Prof. Christian709 Drosten (Charit\u00e9 Berlin, Germany) through the European Virology Archive at 710 passage 2. Working virus stocks were generated by passaging the virus two times in 711 previously described (Cortese et al.generate the lentiviral construct pWPI_GFP-DFCP1, the GFP-DFCP1 721 sequence was first inserted into the pENTR1A vector using plasmid 722 GFP-DFCP1/pMRX-puro (Hamasaki et al., 2013) as template and primers specified 723 in Key Resources Table. Thereafter, the GFP-DFCP1 sequence was inserted into 724 the pWPI vector using the LR recombinase of the Gateway system (Thermo Fisher 725 Scientific) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The construct encoding 726 the inactive PI3P sensor (pWPI_GFP-DFCP1*) was generated by PCR-based 727 mutagenesis using pWPI_GFP-DFCP1 as template and primers specified in Key 728 control of the T7 RNA polymerase promoter. This T7 based system allows 735 cytoplasmic transcription, thus avoiding possible splicing of the mRNA in the case of 736 nuclear transcription as would happen e.g. in commonly used CMV promoter based 737 expression constructs. The SARS2_NG-HA-3-4-V5 expression construct (Tabata et 738 al., 2021) was obtained by using the expression vector piRO_Z-NG (Goellner et al., 739 2020) and replacing the Zika virus sequence by the HA-nsp3-4-V5 SARS-CoV2 740 coding region using the InFusion system (Clontech Laboratories) and primers listed 741 in Key Resources Table. Other plasmids used in this study are listed in Key 742 Resources Table. 743 744 Plasmid DNA transfection 745 For plasmid transfection, 1x10 5 /ml target cells were seeded in 6-or 24-well 746 plates or glass-bottom culture dishes containing gridded coverslips 5B_JFH/NS5A EGFP , SARS2_HA-3-4-V5, or SARS2_NG-HA-3-4-V5 749 plasmids were transfected using the TransIT-LT1 Transfection Reagent (Mirus Bio) 750 according to the manufacturer's protocol. Cells were harvested at time points 751 specified in the result section for further analyses. 752 753 Lentivirus production and establishment of stable cell lines 754 Huh7-Lunet/T7/ACE2 cells were obtained by lentiviral transduction. Lentiviral 756 vectors pWPI_GFP-DFCP1 or pWPI_GFP-DFCP1* were transfected into HEK-293T 757 cells along with packaging (pCMV-dR8.91) and envelope (pMD2.G) plasmids using 758 polyethylenimine as reported earlier (Klages et al., 2000; Stoeck et al., 2018). 759 Supernatants were harvested at 48 h and 72 h post-transfection, filtered and used to 760 transduce target cells. Two days after transduction, cells were cultured in medium 761 containing 10 \u00b5g/ml Blasticidin (Sigma). To generate ATG5 and ATG16L1 KO cells, 762 annealed oligonucleotides were inserted into a lentiCRIPSRv2 plasmid (Addgene), 763 in which single guide (sg) RNAs are transcribed under control of an U6 promoter. 764 sgRNA sequences targeting ATG5 and ATG16L1 are 765 5'-AACTTGTTTCACGCTATATC-3' and 5'-GCTGCAGAGACAGGCGTTCG-3', 766respectively. Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells were infected with lentiviruses generated as 767 described above and subjected to selection using DMEM cplt containing 3 \u03bcg/ml 768 puromycin (Sigma Aldrich) for 1 week prior to use. For ectopic ACE2 expression, 769Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells with ATG5 or ATG16L1 KO, or with GFP-DFCP1 or mutant 770 expression, were additionally transduced with a lentivirus encoding full length human 771 ACE2 followed by selection with G418 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).772 773 HCV replication assay 774 HCV replicons or genomes encoding firefly or Renilla luciferase, respectively, 775 were transfected into Huh7-derived cells and viral replication was measured by 776 cells were lysed in luciferase lysis buffer (25 mM glycylglycin, 15 mM MgSO 4 , 4 mM 778 EGTA, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, pH 7.8) and frozen at -20\u00b0C. Luminescence 779 was measured after adding the respective substrate (coelenterazine for Renilla 780 luciferase and luciferin, glycyl-glycine, ATP and dithiothreitol for firefly luciferase) by 781 using a Mithras LB940 plate luminometer (Berthold Technologies). 782 783 SARS-CoV-2-replication assay (immunostaining) 784 To determine SARS-CoV-2 replication, an immunostaining detecting the 785 nucleocapsid (N) protein was used as reported recently (Steuten et al., 2021). In 786 brief, cells were seeded at a density of 1.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells per well of a flat bottom 96-well 787 plate (Corning). On the next day, SARS-CoV-2 (MOI = 1.0) was added to the 788 compound containing medium. At 16 or 24 h post-infection, plates were fixed with 789 10% formaldehyde and inactivated by incubation of the culture plates in 6% 790 formaldehyde for 30 min. Cells were washed with PBS prior to permeabilization with 791 0.2% Triton X 100 in PBS for 15 min. After blocking of the cells with 2% skim milk, 792 dissolved in PBS containing 0.02% Tween 20, N protein-specific antibody was 793 added for 1 h. Cells were washed with PBS prior to addition of the secondary 794 antibody conjugated with horseradish peroxidase. After 1 h at 37\u00b0C, cells were 795 washed and the signal was developed using TMB substrate. Reaction was 796 quenched by addition of 0.5 M H 2 SO 4 and absorbance was measured at 450 nm 797 using a Tecan XFluor4 reader (Wiesbaden, Germany).",

Relative abundance for SARS-CoV-2 Orf1 810 mRNA was corrected for PCR efficiency and normalized to HPRT transcript level. 811 imaging plates (Greiner) and infected with SARS-CoV-2. At 24 h post infection, cells 815were fixed with paraformaldehyde followed by inactivation with 6% formaldehyde for 816 30 min. After inactivation, cells were immunostained using antibodies specific for 817 SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid (N) protein, and imaging was performed with a Zeiss Cell 818 Discoverer 7 microscope, followed by image analysis as described earlier (Pahmeier 819 et al., 2021). In short, nuclei were segmented using the CellProfiler Analyst software 820 cytoplasmic region and N intensity was measured in this area. Next, a 822 semi-supervised machine learning classification of cells into N-positive or -negative 823 classes was performed using CellProfiler Analyst. Percentage infected cells and 824 total number of cells analyzed (minimum 5,000 cells per sample) for ATG5 or 825ATG16L1 knockout cells was calculated by normalization to their respective values 826 obtained with control KO cells. 827 828 Cell viability assays 829 Cytotoxicity was measured by using two different assays as specified in the 830 results section. First, we used the CellTiter-Glo Luminescent Assay kit (Promega), 831 quantifying intracellular ATP content, according to the manufacturer's instructions. In 832 brief, cells were lysed by adding an amount of CellTiter-Glo Reagent equal to the cell 833 culture medium volume. After gentle mixing and 10 min incubation at room 834 temperature, luminescence was measured using a Mithras LB940 plate luminometer 835 (Berthold Technologies). Second, cell cytotoxicity was measured by WST-1 assay 836 (Roche). Cells were seeded into 96 well-plates in triplicates and cultured for duration 837 indicated in the result section. Culture medium was removed and cells were 838 incubated in 100 \u00b5l/well of WST-reagent at 37\u00b0C for 30 min. Cell viability was 839 analyzed by measuring absorbance at 450 nm using a Tecan XFluor4 reader 840 (Wiesbaden, Germany). 841 842 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Plaque assay was performed as described previously (Klein et al., 2020). In 844 short, VeroE6 cells were seeded in duplicate prior to inoculation with serial 10-fold 845 dilutions of SARS-CoV-2 containing supernatants obtained from the time-course of 846 infection of Huh7-Lunet/ACE2 and A549/ACE2 cells. After 1 h at 37\u00b0C, inoculum was 847 replaced by serum-free MEM (GIBCO, Life Technologies), supplemented with 0.8% 848 carboxymethylcellulose (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were fixed three days post infection 849 with formaldehyde for 30 min. Plates were plunged in 6% formaldehyde for 850 inactivation and transported outside the BSL3 area. After washing the plates with 851 water, the wells were stained with 1% crystal violet prepared in 10% ethanol for 30 852 min. After rinsing the plates with water, the number of plaques was counted and virus 853 titers were calculated. 854 855 siRNA-based knockdown (KD) 856 For siRNA transfection, Huh7-Lunet/T7 cells were seeded at a density of 1x10 6 857 cells per 6-cm diameter dish or 5x10 5 cells per well of a 6-well plate. Cells were 858 transfected twice with 50 pmole or 25 pmole siRNAs, respectively, at 24-h intervals 859 using the Lipofectamine RNAiMAX Reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to 860 the instructions of the manufacturer. For reverse transfection, 3 pmole siRNA were 861 mixed with 0.25 \u00b5l RNAiMAX Reagent and spotted into a well of a 96-well plate. 862 Target A549/ACE2 cells were seeded at a density of 2x10 4 cells per well of a 96-well 863 results section. 865 Preparation of in vitro transcripts and RNA transfection by electroporation 867 RNA transcripts were generated from linearized plasmid DNAs by in vitro 868 transcription using 80 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 12 mM MgCl 2 , 2 mM spermidine, 40 mM 869 dithiothreitol, 3.125 mM of each nucleotide, 1 U/\u00b5l RNasin (Promega), 0.6 U/\u00b5l T7 870 RNA polymerase and 10 \u00b5g DNA template. Reaction mixture was incubated at 37\u00b0C 871 for 2 h in a total volume of 100 \u00b5l. Another 0.3 U/\u00b5l T7 RNA polymerase was added 872 after 2 h incubation and reaction was continued for another 2 h. Reaction was 873 stopped by adding 2 U of RNase-free DNase (Promega) per \u00b5g DNA and 1 h 874 incubation at 37\u00b0C. RNA was purified with acidic phenol-chloroform, precipitated 875 with isopropanol, and dissolved in RNase-free water. 876 For RNA transfection, target cells were prepared by trypsinization and 877 resuspended in Cytomix (van den Hoff et al., 1992) supplemented with 5 mM 878 glutathione and 2 mM ATP at a concentration of 10 7 cells/ml. For electroporation, 5 879 \u00b5g (subgenomic) or 10 \u00b5g (genomic) transcripts were mixed with 400 \u00b5l cell 880 suspension, cells were transferred into a 0.4-cm cuvette (Bio-Rad) and subjected to 881 an electrical pulse of 975 \u00b5F and 270 V in a Gene Pulser system (Bio-Rad). 882 corresponding secondary antibody. Signals were detected using the Western 907 lightning plus-ECL reagent (PerkinElmer) and an Intas ChemoCam Imager 3.2 908 (Intas). Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and image analysis 911 Sample preparation was performed as described previously (Paul et al., 2011; 912 Stoeck et al., 2018). Briefly, 24 h after transfection cells were washed with PBS, fixed 913 for 30 min with CaCo buffer (2.5% glutaraldehyde and 2% sucrose in 50 mM sodium 914 cacodylate, pH 7.4), supplemented with 50 mM KCl, 2.6 mM MgCl 2 and 2.6 mM 915",
