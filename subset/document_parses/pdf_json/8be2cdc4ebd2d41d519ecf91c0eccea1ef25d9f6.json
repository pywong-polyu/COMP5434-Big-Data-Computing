This study investigated the prevalence of bovine coronavirus (BCoV), bovine norovirus (BNoV), bovine group A rotavirus (BoRVA), and bovine torovirus (BToV) in calves aged \u2264 60 days, regardless of diarrhea, across nine different regions in the Republic of Korea (ROK) and reported associations between these viruses and diarrhea. Fecal samples were collected rectally from 689 calves: normal (n = 360) and diarrheic (n = 329). BNoV (84/689, 12.2%) was the most prevalent regardless of diarrhea, followed by BCoV (37/689, 5.4%), BToV (15/689, 2.2%), and BoRVA (13/689, 1.9%). Although BCoV (P = 0.032) and BoRVA (P = 0.007) were significantly associated with diarrhea in pre-weaned calves, BNoV and BToV showed no association. Infection by the four pathogens had no relationship with calf age; BoRVA was detected only in calves aged < 30 days, but this finding was not statistically significant. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BCoV isolates obtained in this study were distinct from the other known BCoVs, and all BNoV isolates belonged to GIII.2 genotype; genetic variations in BNoVs are present in the ROK. BoRVA isolates distributed in the ROK were assigned to G6P[5]. Within the P[5] genotype, our isolates were divided into two lineages: P[5]-III and P[5]-VIII. P[5]-VIII lineage was dominant in pre-weaned Korean native calves. Our BToV isolates were more closely related to a European isolate, B145, than to Japanese isolates. Here, BNoV was frequently identified in calves, suggesting its non-significant contribution to calf diarrhea, whereas BCoV and BoRVA were responsible for calf diarrhea in the ROK.

In our samples, BNoV was the most frequently detected pathogen; while BNoV and BToV were detected regardless of diarrhea, BCoVand BoRVA were mainly detected in diarrheic feces, suggesting an association with diarrhea. Moreover, the identified viral pathogens had no relationship with calf age. Our present finding that BCoV infection was associated with diarrhea was consistent with the result of a previous study conducted by our group (Park et al. 2018 ). However, the results of the present study did not reveal whether BCoV infection causes diarrhea in calves of only a certain age. Additionally, a possibility of the presence of other pathogens, including other bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, could not be ruled out in the fecal samples in which the abovementioned viral pathogens were not detected. BCoV is considered a major viral pathogen causing CD (Torres-Medina et al. 1985) . Here, BCoV was the second most prevalent viral pathogen detected in 5.4% of all fecal samples. BCoV infections were found in eight of the surveyed regions, reflecting a broad distribution of BCoV among pre-weaned Korean native calves. Although BCoV is more prevalent in calves aged 1-10 days compared with the calves of other age groups, our results demonstrated no association between BCoV infection and calf age. Several studies have reported no association between BCoV infection and CD (Bartels et al. 2010; Uhde et al. 2008) . However, the present study showed that BCoV infections were more commonly identified in diarrheic feces than in normal feces, indicating that BCoV was associated with diarrhea. A phylogenetic analysis based on the S gene revealed that BCoV isolates detected in this study diverged from CD and WD isolates reported previously in the ROK and were clustered into a separate branch. Interestingly, our isolates were more closely related to the isolates from wild animals. This suggests that genetic In this study, BNoV was the most prevalent viral pathogen in pre-weaned Korean native calves. BNoV was detected in eight farms, barring one (Sangju). BNoV alone was identified in Anseong farm, which was cleaner and more spacious than the other farms (Table 2 ). It is speculated that norovirus is a zoonotic pathogen; thus, it is transmitted to calves through humans. According to our results, BNoV had an infection rate of \u2265 10%, except in the Gimje farm (Table 2 ). Our study reported a BNoV prevalence rate of 12.2%, which was higher than that reported previously in the ROK (Park et al. 2007a) . A previous study reported that BNoV infection is endemic in diarrheic calves in the ROK (Park et al. 2007a) , whereas our results revealed that BNoV was found regardless of diarrhea and that BNoV infection had no association with diarrhea. Consequently, we cannot make a definite conclusion that BNoV infection is a direct cause of CD. Moreover, BNoV prevalence was higher in calves aged 1-10 days and gradually decreased with age (Table 5) . We found no correlation between BCoV and calf age. BNoV occurred as a co-infection with BCoV or BToV, but not with BoRVA. Owing to few coinfection samples, it was not possible to demonstrate that those viruses were associated with diarrhea. Based on the partial RdRp region, 50 BNoV isolates were classified into GIII.2 genotype and were divergent from the previously reported Korean isolates (Fig. 2) . The results suggest that GIII.2 is the dominant genotype of BNoV circulating in the ROK, with genetic variations occurring in this strain. Further studies are warranted to investigate the pathogenicity and pathogenesis of BNoV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 176, "end": 191, "text": "11-20 (n = 197)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 949, "end": 966, "text": "(Park et al. 2018", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1372, "end": 1399, "text": "(Torres-Medina et al. 1985)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 1892, "end": 1913, "text": "(Bartels et al. 2010;", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1914, "end": 1931, "text": "Uhde et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 3007, "end": 3026, "text": "(Park et al. 2007a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 3117, "end": 3136, "text": "(Park et al. 2007a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2679, "end": 2687, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 2885, "end": 2893, "text": "(Table 2", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}, {"start": 3460, "end": 3469, "text": "(Table 5)", "ref_id": "TABREF4"}, {"start": 3865, "end": 3873, "text": "(Fig. 2)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "BoRVA is the primary cause of acute diarrhea in neonatal calves (Reynolds et al. 1986; Snodgrass 1986; Uhde et al. 2008) . Here, the prevalence of BoRVA was considerably higher in diarrheic feces than that in normal feces. The present study revealed that BoRVA infection was significantly associated with diarrhea. BoRVA infection was observed only in calves aged < 30 days, indicating that BoRVA causes diarrhea in young animals. Here, the prevalence of BoRVA was very low, whether the infection rate of BoRVA is originally low or whether it varies according to different groups of rotaviruses, such as group B and group C, remains unclear to date. A previous study revealed that group C rotavirus caused diarrhea in Korean native calves (Park et al. 2011) . Another possibility is that vaccination for BoRVA has been well implemented in the ROK, which has caused a reduction in BoRVA infection rate among calves. This reflects the importance of vaccination. Several reports have indicated that the most prevalent genotypes of BoRVA are G6, G8, and G10 in combination with P Badaracco et al. 2013; Collins et al. 2014; Fukai et al. 2004; Park et al. 2011 ). All our isolates detected in this study were assigned to G6P[5] . Moreover, to our knowledge, the P[5]-III and P[5]-VIIIlineages have been identified for the first time in the present study, and the P[5]-VIII lineage is dominant in preweaned Korean native calves. Molecular characterization of RVA strains prevalent among animals is of great importance in terms of both animal and public health.

Our results revealed that the prevalence of BToV was 2.2%, which was slightly lower than that previously reported in the ROK (Park et al. 2008 ). This could be attributed to the different sample collection regions and the different target genes used for detecting BToV as well as calf age. BToV infection was high in Mungyeong farm compared with the other farms. The pathogens detected varied according to the farms from which samples were collected (Table 2) , likely owing to the difference in hygiene levels and management systems in farms. BToV alone acts as a primary enteric pathogen in calves aged < 30 days (Aita et al. 2012) . However, our result showed that BToV infection was more prevalent in calves aged \u2264 30 days, but this prevalence was not statistically significant (P = 0.137) and was also not associated with diarrhea (P = 0.662). Our findings were inconsistent with those of a previous study (Aita et al. 2012) . Here, BToV was found only in co-infections with BCoVor BNoV (Table 4) , and these co-infections did not cause diarrhea. To date, there is little available information regarding BToV infection causing diarrhea in the ROK.
