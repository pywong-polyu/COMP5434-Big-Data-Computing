            "text": "Nowadays, deep learning achieves higher levels of accuracy than ever before. This evolution makes deep learning crucial for applications that care for safety, like selfdriving cars and helps consumers to meet most of their expectations. Further, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are powerful approaches that employed to solve several issues. These issues include healthcare, advertising, marketing, computer vision, speech processing, natural language processing. The DNNs have marvelous progress in these different fields, but training such DNN models requires a lot of time, a vast amount of data and in most cases a lot of computational steps. Selling such pre-trained models is a profitable business model. But, sharing them without the owner permission is a serious threat. Unfortunately, once the models are sold, they can be easily copied and redistributed. This paper first presents a review of how digital watermarking technologies are really very helpful in the copyright protection of the DNNs. Then, a comparative study between the latest techniques is presented. Also, several optimizers are proposed to improve the accuracy against the fine-tuning attack. Finally, several experiments are performed with black-box settings using several optimizers and the results are compared with the SGD optimizer.",

This is a pretty new area for the community of Machine Learning (ML), and this problem is wellstudied under the concept of digital watermarking in the security community. Digital Watermarking (DW) is known as the process of concealing information robustly in a signal (text, image, video or audio) to verify authenticity. Watermarking used to be extensively investigated within digital media or digital keys [42] . Existing watermarking approaches are not directly flexible in dealing with several cases of DNNs. Designing an efficient watermark to secure DNN is exacerbated because it should preserve the functionality of the DNNs model as well. So, if the parameters are modified because of watermark adding, DNN should preserve its ability to perform its task, e.g., classification, regression\u2026\u2026etc. Also, DNN model owners often prefer a watermarking algorithm which is used to preserve ownership than using simple hash functions which are based on matrices weight [2] .",

The idea was simple, but it was not widely usable till the mid of 1980s. Here came the role of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD), which they used to train their multilayer networks. As the modules were somehow smooth in terms of functions, input, and internal weights, they computed gradients using the procedure of backpropagation. The belief that all of this could be performed; and that it already began to work; was discovered by several different groups independently during 1970s and 1980 [49, 61] . In [64] , the authors declared the importance of optimization algorithms in improving the accuracy of the DNN model. They mentioned that different types of optimizers were developed to face the challenges related to the learning stage. They examined six optimizers in their study (SGD, RMSprop, Adam, Nesterov Momentum, Adagrad, Adadelta).",

The security of multimedia objects is related to not only the data embedding algorithms but also other issues depend on its purpose (such as different payload partition in the case of RGB image payloads) [30] . Several schemes are designed to conceal information without drawing suspicion [31] . Researchers proposed several effective techniques which aim to protect the information and preserve copyright authentication [58] . Digital watermarking is the process of hiding data into a multimedia object like text, image, voice, or video. These hidden data could be image, logo, text, signature, label, or sound. The confidential hidden data will be later extracted by the other side later to achieve its intended purpose whether copyright authentication, securing information or checking ownership [4] .",

In the spatial domain, the digital watermark is embedded into the pixels of the original signal by directly changing its pixel values. The Least Significant Bits (LSB) is supposed to be the simplest method ever of all spatial domain methods. LSB is based on modifying the original signal's least significant bits by watermarking [3] . In the frequency domain, the embedding procedure is done by transforming the representation of the spatial domain into the frequency domain after that modifying its frequency coefficients in order to embed the digital watermark. There are several transform domain digital watermarking methods such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) [39] , Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) [43] , Discrete Fourier Transforms (DFT) [32] and Discrete Cosine Transforms (DCT) [45] . In general, spatial domain methods are not robust against several attacks, but on the other hand, they are easy to be implemented. Frequency domain methods are better than most spatial domain methods in terms of being robust against several types of attacks, but they need higher computational cost [3] .",

The digital watermarked signal may expose to any type of attack or pass safely. In the extraction phase, the receiver receives the digitally watermarked signal and uses that chosen technique to split the digital watermark from the original signal. Without an attack case, the extracted digital watermark is frequently the same as the digital watermark before sending. But, in an attack case, if the used technique is not robust enough, the extracted digital watermark will be somehow ruined [11, 12] .",

They separated the colored image into its three RGB components; red, green, and blue. They fused each channel with a grayscale then integrated the three images into a grayscale fused image. At last, they burred the fused image into an image to produce the final watermarked image. Their model evaluation was done using various images with different hacking techniques. Their experimental results showed that even after the watermarked image suffered from attacks; the watermark image will still be recognized. In [13] , Fkirin et al. realized that watermarking alone sometimes is not enough. When watermarking is used to hide critical data into a cover image to secure it, the critical hidden data may be attacked, damaged, or extracted with other parties. They presented a two-level security framework to keep colored watermark images protected. The first level was about embedding the color image into a grayscale image using a multi-level DWT, SVD, and wavelet fusion. The second level was meant to add an additional encryption process. This encryption process was done using Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in a case and a twodimensional logistic chaotic map in another case. Their framework was evaluated using different hacks on several images. Their experimental results showed that their framework is efficient against several attacks such as Wrap, Gaussian, Blur, and Cropping. Additionally, their extracted watermarks proved to be recognized even after attacks on the marked images.",

This model's purpose was to achieve copyright protection for DNN by embedding a digital watermark. They used a parameter regularizer to embed the watermark into the DNN model. They proved that the performance of their DNN model after embedding the watermark doesn't degrade. Also, after parameter pruning or finetuning, the watermark didn't disappear. Even after pruning 65% of the parameters, the watermark remained. Accordingly, sometimes it will be easier to fine-tune existing models when there is not available enough training data [46, 63] . Generally, fine-tuning will be a good choice if the dataset is not contextually different from the dataset that the pre-trained model is trained on. So, fine-tuning can be considered as a very efficient approach for plagiarizers to train a new model using the previously stolen model with new fewer training data. In the end, the new model inherits the stolen model performance. However, it will look different from the stolen model [65] .",

They proposed a zero-bit watermarking model that can make use of adversarial model cases. They limited the protected model loss performance by allowing the watermark subsequent extraction using few queries. They experimented their model on the MNIST dataset on three different neural networks designed especially for image classification purpose. They focused on classification problem, mainly as it accounts for many machine learning-based services. Their model proved its robustness as it can face overwriting, compression attacks and transfer learning issue. They are willing to discuss other problems as a future work like images semantic segmentation or regressions as adversarial examples affect those domains as well. Wang et al. [60] presented a new digital watermarking algorithm that aimed to secure DNNs by marking them. They protected the DNNs by inserting another independent neural network which allowed them to use selective weights in the watermarking process. They embedded the watermark in the host DNN with error back-propagation. They used this independent neural network in the training stage and watermark verification stage, but it was not released publicly. Their experiments showed that there is no degradation in the performance of the marked DNN. In addition, they proved that the watermark was effectively embedded and extracted with a very low neural network loss even if it is exposed to common attacks like compression and fine-tuning, that has shown their proposed work applicability and superiority. Their work provided higher-level fidelity, capacity, and robustness. Gupta et al. [15] proposed a new framework to protect the copyrights of a critical trained DNN model. Protecting their DNN model is necessary as their model is concerned with medical X-rays images that should be kept secure. They embedded the watermark into the training images. Their model was trained with chest X-rays for infected and non-infected people with coronavirus disease. They used a total number of 2000 images. Their model achieved accuracy above 96%. Their proposed DNN model can predict the probability of coronavirus disease infection, which can be a rescuer solution for that epidemic. They aimed to reduce the widespread of this disease. Their results suggested that creating a DNN model which can distinguish between infected normal and normal peoples' chest X-ray could be a vital solution that leads to early detection of coronavirus disease. They embedded the watermark in their critical model to secure it against any possible intellectual property theft.",

As shown in [41, 57] , the watermarking weights can easily exposure to overwriting attacks. A robustness comparison between [48] and \" [41, 57] \" is shown in Table 2 . This comparison clarifies that [48] is more robust than \" [41, 57] \" in terms of surviving against overwriting attacks. Table 3 shows a robustness comparison against pruning attack. When considering the CIFAR10-WRN benchmark, [48] is more robust than [41, 57] in terms of withstanding pruning attack. On the other hand, authors of [2, 48, 65] targeted black-box settings [6] . Mentioned three papers used for their experiments CIFAR-10 dataset also MNIST [24] . Table 4 shows a comparison of their accuracy after watermark embedding [6] .",

Training DNNs models need a lot of time, an enormous amount of data and mostly expensive computational cost. Selling or distributing these models without owner permission is a significant problem. So, the copyright protection of DNNs is a vital issue. In this paper, we discuss the concept of using digital watermarking to preserve the copyright of DNN models. Also, a comparative study is presented to know the best between the latest technique in this trend. The comparison is made in both black-box and white-box settings. Our side-by-side comparison helps the researchers in this new field to complete their vision of securing DNN. Also, the comparative study between several optimizers shows that changing the optimizer affect the accuracy for sure and make it better sometimes and worst in other situations. It is proven that Adagrad and Adamax optimizers are better than SGD optimizer when performed with black-box settings. On the other hand, SGD optimizer is better than Adam optimizer.
