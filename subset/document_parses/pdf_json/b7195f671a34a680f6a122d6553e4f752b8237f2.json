The mechanisms that drive endothelial activation and the inflammatory response in O. tsutsugamushi infection remain unknown. In addition, the interaction between monocytes and endothelial cells is still unclear. Here we demonstrate that O. tsutsugamushi-infected human dermal microvascular endothelial cells produced moderate levels of chemokines and low levels of IL-6 and IFN-b, but not TNF or IL-1b. Recombinant TNF and cytokine-rich supernatants from infected monocytes markedly enhanced chemokine production in infected endothelial cells. We also show that TNF and monocyte supernatants, but not O. tsutsugamushi infection of endothelial cells per se, upregulated the endothelial cell surface expression of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and tissue factor. This finding was consistent with the inability of O. tsutsugamushi to induce cytokine secretion from endothelial cells. The upregulation of surface molecules after stimulation with monocyte supernatants was significantly reduced by neutralizing anti-TNF antibodies. These results suggest that endothelial cell activation and response are mainly mediated by inflammatory cytokines secreted from monocytes.",

The invasion of these rickettsial organisms into ECs results in vascular injury accompanied by perivascular mononuclear infiltration in visceral organs (Moron et al., 2001) . The vascular damage and inflammation can cause complications. Previous studies have demonstrated that OT induces cytokine and chemokine transcript expression in ECs such as human dermal microvascular endothelial cells (HMECs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) (Cho et al., 2001; Ge et al., 2019; Mika-Gospodorz et al., 2020) , but the protein expression of these mediators has not been studied. EC activation markers are also increased in sera of patients with scrub typhus (Paris et al., 2012a) . Animal model studies have demonstrated the modulation of angiopoietin (Ang1 and Ang2) by OT infection and suggested that EC activation and dysfunction in visceral organs underlie the pathology of scrub typhus (Soong et al., 2014; Shelite et al., 2016; Soong et al., 2017; Trent et al., 2020) . Moreover, OT infection of monocytes results in high levels of cytokine expression and secretion (Tantibhedhyangkul et al., 2011) , which may lead to systemic inflammation. However, the effects of cytokines secreted from monocytes on ECs during OT infection have not been studied. Indeed, inflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF and IL-1, are well known to promote EC activation (Grignani and Maiolo, 2000) . Therefore, we questioned whether EC activation in OT infection is mediated by infected ECs per se or by the cytokines secreted from infected monocytes.",

Previous studies have demonstrated inflammasome activation and IL-1b secretion from OT-infected monocytes and macrophages (Tantibhedhyangkul et al., 2011; Koo et al., 2012; Tantibhedhyangkul et al., 2013) . However, the data of inflammasome activation in endothelial cells during an infection are still limited. We analyzed protein expression of components associated with the inflammasome complex and IL-1b release, including NLRP3, pro-caspase-1, pro-caspase-4 [associated with non-canonical inflammasome activation (Yang et al., 2015) ], pro-IL-1b and cleaved caspase-1 (p20). We demonstrated that HMECs expressed only pro-caspase-1 and its expression seemed to be increased by OT infection. In contrast, the expression NLRP3, pro-IL-1b, pro-caspase-4, and cleaved caspase-1 was undetectable ( Figure 2) . The absence of these components correlated with the inability of HMECs to secrete IL-1b. Like LPS-primed HMECs, priming of HMECs with TNF or cytokines from infected monocytes failed to induce these protein components except pro-caspase-1 (Data not shown).",

            "text": "Endothelial cells are one of the main targets of OT infection. The complications in rickettsial infections result from vasculitis and vascular injury induced by bacterial invasion into ECs and inflammatory response. However, it is unclear whether the inflammatory response is mediated by ECs or neighboring immune cells such as mononuclear phagocytes. This study showed that ECs produce moderate levels of chemokines and low levels of cytokines (IL-6 and IFN-b) but undetectable levels of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1b). Chemokine secretion by ECs was enhanced by TNF and cytokine(s) from infected monocytes. We also showed that upregulation of ICAM-1, E-selectin, and tissue factor in ECs was mediated by cytokine(s), especially TNF, from monocytes, but not by direct invasion of OT into ECs. Previous studies have shown the chemokine mRNA upregulation in OT-infected HMECs (Cho et al., 2001; Ge et al., 2019; Mika-Gospodorz et al., 2020) , but chemokine secretion has not been studied. The effects of cytokines from immune cells on HMECs in OT infection have never been investigated. Evidence suggests that monocytes are the primary target cell, particularly at the early stage of infection (Paris et al., 2012b) . Previous studies have shown that monocytes and macrophages produce high levels of inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1 (Tantibhedhyangkul et al., 2011; Tantibhedhyangkul et al., 2013) . There may be some differences between monocytes and ECs. In this study, we showed that OT mainly induced chemokine secretion without TNF and IL-1b. The low cytokine secretion from ECs may be an immune evasion strategy that prevents early endothelial cell activation and inflammatory response. On the other hand, chemokines (CCL2, CCL5, CXCL10) recruit monocytes and lymphocytes at the infected sites (Viola et al., 2008) . These chemokines may be partly beneficial to host defense, but they may attract monocytes from blood to tissues. Consequently, due to the OT tropism for monocytes/ macrophages, the accumulation of these target cells may promote bacterial replication and is thus detrimental to the host.",

Our previous study also demonstrated the lack of TLR2 and TLR4 ligand in OT organisms (Tantibhedhyangkul et al., 2017a) , which may explain the inadequate cytokine secretion in OT-infected HMECs. Moreover, the lack of NLRP3 expression, which is the crucial receptor for inflammasome activation (Swanson et al., 2019) , may explain the inability of HMECs to cleave caspase-1 and secrete IL-1b. IFN-b together with IL-6 is the signature response to cytosolic DNA (Shirota et al., 2006) , the putative ligand of cytosolic pathogens (Stetson and Medzhitov, 2006) . Our results showed that HMECs secrete IL-6 and IFN-b, but the levels are much lower than monocytes. IL-6 is implicated in the pathogenesis of some infectious diseases such as COVID-19 (McGonagle et al., 2020) . Thus, a study of IL-6 in scrub typhus is worth pursuing. Similar to previous studies, we observed that the FIGURE 2 | Immunoblot of components associated with inflammasome activation. HMECs were primed or unprimed with LPS (1 \u00b5g/ml) for 6 hours before OT infection. Lysates and supernatants were collected at indicated time. LPS-primed and ATP-stimulated HMECs were included as a control. The positive controls were LPS-primed and OT-stimulated monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM, cell lysates) and Salmonella-infected MDM (supernatants). Data are representative of three independent experiments. secretion of IFN-b is persistent at 24 and 48 h post-infection. The positive feedback mechanism of type I IFNs can explain this persistence (Decker et al., 2005) . IFN-b subsequently upregulates interferon-stimulated genes, including chemokines such as CCL5 and CXCL10 (Van Boxel-Dezaire et al., 2006) , which are upregulated in our study. Since these chemokines attract mononuclear cells, we hypothesize that IFN-b is partly involved in perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration and vasculitis in scrub typhus.",

            "text": "Our focus here is on CCL2 (chemokine for monocytes) and CXCL10 (chemokines for lymphocytes during type 1 immune response). Several cytokines have been shown to upregulate these chemokines. CCL2 (MCP-1) is a key cytokine for monocyte migration, can be upregulated by proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. TNF, IL-1 and IL-6) (Deshmane et al., 2009; Bianconi et al., 2018) and plays an important role in host defense against several intracellular pathogens (Serbina et al., 2008) . CXCL10 (IP-10) is upregulated by TNF and interferons (Lee et al., 2013) , interacts with CXCR3 expressed on Th1, CD8 + T cells and NK cells to attract these lymphocytes to infected sites (Viola et al., 2008; Metzemaekers et al., 2017) . Apart from CXCL10 and CCL5 in this study, other CXCR3 ligands (CXCL9 and CXCL11) and CCL5 ligands (CCL3 and CCL4) were reportedly upregulated in OT-infected cells or in sera of infected animals or humans (Cho et al., 2000; Koh et al., 2004; De Fost et al., 2005; Yun et al., 2005; Tantibhedhyangkul et al., 2011) . We hypothesize that proinflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1, IL-6) play an essential role in promoting chemokine production during early infection because these inflammatory cytokines are usually decreased at the late phase (De Fost et al., 2005; Tantibhedhyangkul et al., 2013) . Then, IFN-b is more critical during late infection because of the persistent kinetics of type I IFN production. Similar to our study, previous studies have shown that Rickettsia-infected human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVECs) secrete IL-6, but not TNF or IL-1b. In addition, cell-associated IL-1a is detectable in cell lysates, but not supernatants of rickettsia-infected cells (Kaplanski et al., 1995; Sporn and Marder, 1996) . Our study focuses on IL-1b because this cytokine is secreted upon inflammasome activation, contributes to systemic inflammation, and is more widely studied (Dinarello, 2011) . On the other hand, IL-1a usually exists as a membrane-bound protein and can be released upon cell death (Malik and Kanneganti, 2018) . A previous study has demonstrated that OT-infected ECV304 secrete several cytokines and chemokines including TNF, IL-1b, and IL-6 (Cho et al., 2010) . Since ECV304 is known to cross-contaminate with a urinary bladder carcinoma cell line (Dirks et al., 1999; Brown et al., 2000) , the response of this cell line may not truly represent that of endothelial cells. Although studies using different endothelial cell origins such as transformed immortalized HMECs and mouse microvascular endothelial cells have demonstrated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1b release following different stimuli (Xia et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016; Shrivastava et al., 2020) , our results failed to discover these findings. This discrepancy may be due to the differences in endothelial cell origins, culture conditions and the stimuli. In addition, the expression levels of NLRP3 and cleaved caspase-1 in our primary HMECs may be lower than the detection limit of Western blotting in our studies.",

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated that soluble EC activation markers are detectable in scrub typhus patients (Paris et al., 2012a) . In addition, these endothelial adhesion molecules were reportedly upregulated in mouse models of scrub typhus (Soong et al., 2017; Trent et al., 2020) . However, EC activation mechanisms in scrub typhus are still unclear. We showed that OT infection barely induced upregulation of adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and Eselectin), but cytokines from monocytes are the primary inducer of EC activation. Among cytokines from monocytes, TNF is likely to play a significant role in EC activation. Lack of early adhesion molecule expression on OT-infected HMECs per se may be an immune evasion strategy of OT organisms to prevent lymphocyte migration and evade early lymphocyte killing of infected cells. However, these adhesion molecules and chemokine expression which are upregulated at the later phase of infection by TNF from infected monocytes may recruit mononuclear leukocytes and amplify more inflammation during OT infection. Tissue factor is well known to be upregulated in cardiovascular disease inflammation (Witkowski et al., 2016) , but is not widely studied in infectious diseases. We also showed that ECs upregulated surface tissue factor expression following stimulation with monocyte cytokine(s). In contrast to OT infection in this study, a previous study showed that Rickettsia rickettsii infection without exogenous TNF treatment was sufficient to upregulate tissue factor expression on HUVECs (Teysseire et al., 1992) . This discrepancy may be due to the differences in organisms and host cells. The upregulation of tissue factor on the EC cell membrane may be involved in blood clotting, coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation FIGURE 4 | Proposed diagram of the interaction between endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages. During OT infection, endothelial cells (EC) are activated by TNF from OT-infected monocytes (Mo)/macrophages (Mac), upregulate adhesion molecules (ICAM-1 and E-selectin) and produce chemokines to attract mononuclear cells. CCL2/CCL5 and CCL5/CXCL10 attract monocytes and lymphocytes (Lym), respectively. The immune-mediated mechanisms may contribute to perivascular mononuclear cell infiltration and vasculitis in scrub typhus patients. Moreover, tissue factor upregulated by TNF may contribute to disseminated intravascular coagulation during scrub typhus.",

Cytokines from infected monocytes are the key factor that induces endothelial cell activation and response characterized by upregulation of ICAM-1, E-selectin and tissue factor as well as chemokines for mononuclear cell infiltration. After OT infection, the inadequate cytokine response of endothelial cells may be a subversion strategy to evade host early inflammation and promote bacterial growth. The upregulation of tissue factor may be one mechanism involved in DIC in severe cases of scrub typhus. Further studies are required to clarify this pathogenesis in human scrub typhus patients.",
