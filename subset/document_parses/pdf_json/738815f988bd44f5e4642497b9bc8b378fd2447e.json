AAS increase the physical endurance and performance of athletes, which might lead to better results in sports. Other users take AAS for purely aesthetic reasons for a more effective increase in muscle mass. Nevertheless, whether they are professional or amateur athletes, the undeclared presence of AAS [1, 2] in dietary supplements pose a potential threat to all of them, whether for health or doping reasons [3] [4] [5] .",

            "text": "The basic methods for the detection of AAS include, in particular, gas or liquid chromatography combined with mass detection (GC-MS, HPLC-MS, respectively). Other commonly used methods include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [6] [7] [8] [9] . In our recent work by Huml et al. [7] , we have described the development of a group-selective immunoassay method based on stanazolol (ST)-derived polyclonal rabbit antibodies (RAb). In the latter paper [7] , hapten ST-3 obtained by alkylation of the pyrazole ring showed the best performance in convenient ELISA assays. Conjugated hapten to rabbit serum albumin (RSA) was simply marked RSA/ST-3 (Supplementary Figure S1 ). As the result serum albumin (RSA) was simply marked RSA/ST-3 (Supplementary Figure S1 ). As the result of this work [7] , we found that the RAb 212 antibody had strong cross-reactivity (CR) for 17 -methylated AAS in an indirect competitive ELISA setup ( Figure 1 ). The applicability of this group-selective method was further demonstrated in a series of policeintercepted preparations containing AAS. Based on these results, our group began to develop an immunochromatographic test (ICT) that would be well applicable in field conditions and could be useful for the immediate identification of suspect samples. The ICT (or LFIA-lateral flow immunoassay) method is based on test strips, which consist of several parts (Figure 2A ) [10] . ICT method was first used to determine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine to detect pregnancy. Due to the ease of use and commercial attractiveness of immunochromatographic assays [11] , research and development in this area has expanded considerably. A wide range of analytes including viruses (e.g., hepatitis B [12] , HIV [13] , SARS-CoV-2 [14] ), bacteria (e.g., Helicobacter pylori [15] , Staphylococcus aureus [16] , Salmonella [17] ), toxins [18] [19] [20] , pesticides [21] , cancer markers [22, 23] , antibiotics [24, 25] , drugs [26, 27] , terpenes [28] and steroids [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] have been used to construct useful immunochromatographic assays.",

            "text": "ICT methods have a lower sensitivity compared to the ELISA, usually increasing the detection limit by one order of magnitude [21, 36, 37] . Therefore, in this work, the competitive test was arranged in indirect ( Figure 2C ) and direct format ( Figure 2D ), because the method of arrangement could have the effect of reducing the detection limit of the developed method. The difference is in the labeled antibodies. In the direct format, the primary antibody (against the analyte conjugate) is labeled, while in the indirect format, a tertiary antibody is bound to the NPs, which specifically binds to the primary antibody. Based on these results, our group began to develop an immunochromatographic test (ICT) that would be well applicable in field conditions and could be useful for the immediate identification of suspect samples. The ICT (or LFIA-lateral flow immunoassay) method is based on test strips, which consist of several parts (Figure 2A ) [10] . ICT method was first used to determine human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in urine to detect pregnancy. Due to the ease of use and commercial attractiveness of immunochromatographic assays [11] , research and development in this area has expanded considerably. A wide range of analytes including viruses (e.g., hepatitis B [12] , HIV [13] , SARS-CoV-2 [14] ), bacteria (e.g., Helicobacter pylori [15] , Staphylococcus aureus [16] , Salmonella [17] ), toxins [18] [19] [20] , pesticides [21] , cancer markers [22, 23] , antibiotics [24, 25] , drugs [26, 27] , terpenes [28] and steroids [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] have been used to construct useful immunochromatographic assays.",

ICT methods have a lower sensitivity compared to the ELISA, usually increasing the detection limit by one order of magnitude [21, 36, 37] . Therefore, in this work, the competitive test was arranged in indirect ( Figure 2C ) and direct format ( Figure 2D ), because the method of arrangement could have the effect of reducing the detection limit of the developed method. The difference is in the labeled antibodies. In the direct format, the primary antibody (against the analyte conjugate) is labeled, while in the indirect format, a tertiary antibody is bound to the NPs, which specifically binds to the primary antibody.",

After the membrane was reinforced, immunoreagents were applied to the membrane using a Linomat 5 instrument to form control (CL) and test lines (TL). Antibodies were immobilized in CL. In the case of the indirect format, DAG was diluted in 5 mmol/L borate buffer to 100 \u00b5g/mL; in the case of the direct format, GAR was diluted in the same buffer to 150 \u00b5g/mL.

For indirect format, 3 \u00b5L of GAR-AuNPs and 2 \u00b5L of RAb 212 antibody per strip, for direct format 3.5 \u00b5L of RAb-AuNPs conjugate were applied.

The conjugation pad made of glass, polyester or cellulose fibers is part of a closed format, where a conjugate of NPs with antibodies is applied. The sample application pad is made of cellulose or glass fibers. Both of these pads also serve as a filter to retain unwanted larger particles from the sample. At the end of the strip, the absorbent pad accelerates the flow of reagents through the membrane and traps excess material.

As can be seen in Figure S5A , some membranes were unsuitable for this test (i.e., FF80HP, PRIMA 125) because the sample did not completely rise or it returned from the absorbent pad, and thus, the results could not be read despite the staining. Better, although not completely good, results were provided, e.g., by AE 100, where it was possible to read the results. However, the uptake was not sufficient and the reaction mixture returned from the absorbent pad, although this did not clearly affect the lines. Sufficient rise was achieved especially with AE 98 and FF120HP. The visual detection limits (VDLs) of these two membranes were then compared. Because this limit was 5 ng/mL for the AE 98 membranes used for the open format and 8 ng/mL for FF120HP, AE 98 was used in further experiments. Other significant differences were seen when testing the various absorbent pads (Supplementary Figure S5B ). For these, there was a significant difference in thickness, which affected the rate of rise and the amount of reaction mixture captured. For some pads, absorption was insufficient and the mixture refluxed, leaving red streaks. Of all the pads tested, the Grade 320 and Grade 601 pads visually gave the best results. On the Grade 601 strips, the reaction mixture rose very slowly; even after 20 min, the result could not be read. Therefore, Grade 320 was chosen as a suitable pad for further tests, which was the strongest and, therefore, absorbed the most mixture; there was no backflow of immunoreagents and the result could be read already after 10 min. As a result, the strips were clean, free of reaction residue, and nothing affected the intensity of the lines. For other materials from Table S1 , the results differed mainly in the rate of rise in the mixture.",

It was found that for the drying buffer, better results were obtained for buffers with the addition of trehalose, which increased the stability of the components of this buffer. For both buffers, the addition of Tween 20 detergent was necessary, without which the rate of rise was slower, the strips remained red colored, and thus, it was impossible to read the results. Tween 20 serves to reduce non-specific interactions, so it is an essential part of buffers. Furthermore, various combinations of pad drying procedures were tested-only the conjugation pad was dried in the buffer, only the sample pad, or both. The drying time was also examined-1 \u00d7 1 h, 2 \u00d7 1 h (this option was used in previous protocols described by us [8, 26] ) and 1 \u00d7 2 h. The best results were obtained with 0.2 mol/L borate buffer-0.1%, BSA-3%, trehalose-1% Tween 20 for a drying buffer and 0.1 mol/L borate buffer-1%, BSA-1%, PEG-1% Tween 20 for reaction buffer. Drying time was shortened from the original 2 \u00d7 1 h to 1 h with sufficient results. All original and newly selected immunoreagents and materials are summarized in Table 1 .

Therefore, concentrations of 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1 ng/mL were tested, of which a concentration of 0.6 ng/mL was chosen as the VDL. The obtained ST standard curve was nearly identical to the standard curve obtained for indirect format, as can be seen from their analytical features shown in Supplementary Table S3 .",

Reagent concentrations in CL and TL were the same as for the open format; the other conditions were chosen to be the same as the indirect closed format. Only the amount of RAb-AuNPs to be dried on the conjugation pad was tested. Amounts of 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5 and 5 \u00b5L were tested. As can be seen in Supplementary Figure S9A , CL are sufficiently intense for all options, but TL is sufficiently visible for up to 3.5 \u00b5L of RAb-AuNPs conjugate and was, therefore, used for further tests. This was followed by the determination of the VDL. From the calibration series (Supplementary Figure S9B) , it was found that its value is below 1 ng/mL; therefore, concentrations of 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9 and 1 ng/mL were tested of which 0.7 ng/mL was determined as the VDL. The achieved visual detection limit corresponds to the VDLs obtained in the other developed formats (visual detection limits range of 0.5-0.9 ng/mL) and is approximately an order of magnitude higher than the detection limit of ELISA (0.02 ng/mL) in our recent work by Huml et al. [7] . This difference corresponds to previously published studies [21, 36, 37] . None of the ICT test arrangements used resulted in a reduction in the detection limit compared to another format. The indirect closed ICT format will be more appropriate for routine analysis because its cost will be lower compared to the direct format. This format requires reduced amounts of specific (primary) antibody and a \"universal label\"-GAR-AuNPs-which is also suitable for other ICT methods that use a specific rabbit antibody as one of the immunoreactants.",

Ethanol was chosen as the solvent for sample extraction for the closed format of the indirect and direct assay settings, as well as for the ELISA [7] . For ICT, its effect on line intensity, especially on TL, was tested. EtOH was applied as 0.5, 1, 5, 10 and 20% solution diluted in reaction buffer for negative control. In the solutions, thus, prepared, the ST standard was subsequently diluted to a concentration of 1 ng/mL for positive control. In both cases, the respective TL of the strips was compared with either the TL on the strips with zero ST concentration (negative control) or with the TL on the strips with 1 ng/mL ST concentration (positive control) in the absence of EtOH. From the results, it was found that for the indirect format it is sufficient to dilute the EtOH to a 5% solution, but for the direct format, dilution is necessary to 1% solution (Supplementary Figure S10A) . Ethanol extracts of food supplements (matrices-Section 3.2) were diluted 10\u00d7, 50\u00d7, 100\u00d7 and 500\u00d7, i.e., to solutions with 10, 2, 1 and 0.5% EtOH content. When comparing TL intensities, it was found that for the indirect format, the lines are not affected by the 50\u00d7 diluted (2% EtOH) matrix solution and for the direct format by the 100\u00d7 diluted (1% EtOH) matrix solution (Supplementary Figure S10B) . Therefore, the dilution of ethanol extracts of real samples to 1% solutions was chosen, where no effect of matrix or EtOH on any of the developed test formats should be recorded.",

Thus, the antibody used shows CR at such high concentrations of AAS, which are used in real cases. This can be used if we use a two-strip box for sample analysis. In this box, one strip is used as a negative control and the other strip for sample analysis. It is, then, possible to visually monitor the attenuation of the test line in the sample compared to the test line in the control. In this case, the sample can be marked as positive. Contaminated dietary supplements found on the market have different contents of anabolic steroids [54] [55] [56] .
