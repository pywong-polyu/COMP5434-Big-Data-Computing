The TGEV S protein is produced as a 1,447-amino acid precursor polypeptide with a 16-residue signal peptide. According to analysis of the S protein sequences of CoVs with different biological phenotypes, there are 4 antigenic sites (C, B, D, and A in that order) in the N-terminal half of the S protein, among which the A site can induce neutralizing antibodies [4] and is highly conserved in TGEV and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCoV), a respiratory variant of TGEV. The S protein encoded by PRCoV lacks about 200 amino acids in the N-terminal region that contain determinants related to the enteropathogenicity of TGEV [18] . PEDV has a 150-to 220-kDa spike glycoprotein with a homotrimeric structure. The PEDV S protein is also a type I transmembrane glycoprotein that contains 5 regions, a signal peptide (residues 1-20), an S1 region (residues 21-793), an S2 region (residues 794-1385), a transmembrane domain (residues 1335-1358), and a cytoplasmic tail (residues 1359-1385) [19] . The S1 region is responsible for virus particle binding to the cellular receptors, whereas the S2 region participates in membrane fusion of the virus and host cells. Like other CoVs, the S1 region possesses two subdomains comprising an NTD (residues 21-324) and a CTD (residues 253-638). The CTD of the S1 domain binds to a functional cellular receptor for PEDV infection.

Different hosts or virus strains produce evolutionary diversity in the same virus family, and the binding of CoVs to susceptible cells seems to show variation in the receptors used that correspond to viral groups and species. These CoVs recognize distinct cellular receptors and coreceptors, such as proteins and sugars, to facilitate their penetration into cells [8] . Currently, there are 4 main protein receptors: APN, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 1 (CEACAM1), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). Most members of \u03b1-CoV use APN as the receptor for infecting host cells, such as TGEV, PEDV, and HCoV-229E. APN, also known as CD13, is a 150-kDa type II transmembrane protein that belongs to a membrane-bound metalloprotease family [24] . Interestingly, HCoV-NL63, as an \u03b1-CoV, shares the same cell entry receptor, identified as ACE2, with SARS-CoV, which is a \u03b2-CoV. ACE2 is a type I integral membrane glycoprotein with an N-terminal extracellular domain comprising 2 \u03b1-helical lobes, between both of which there is a catalytic site with a coordinated zinc ion [25] . By contrast, the \u03b2-CoV mouse hepatitis virus utilizes CEACAM1 as a cell surface receptor for the S protein. CEACAM1, the first identified CoV receptor [26] , is a type I transmembrane multifunctional protein and a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily termed IgSF. Middle East respiratory syndrome-related CoV, belonging to \u03b2-CoV, has been shown to use DPP4 as a cell entry receptor. DPP4 (also known as CD26), a type II membrane protein, is a multifunctional membrane-bound serine protease that forms homodimers on the surface of host cells. The DPP4 ectodomain comprises about 730 amino acids and has 2 domains, an \u03b1/\u03b2-hydrolase domain and an 8-bladed propeller [27] . Among these cellular receptors and coreceptors, APN is a major cell entry receptor for CoVs. APN exists on the epithelial cell surface of different tissues. In particular, it is expressed abundantly in the brush border membrane of the small intestine, the kidney, and the respiratory tract [28] . Most \u03b1-CoVs use APN as cell entry receptor. For example, previous studies showed that TGEV uses porcine (p) APN as the receptor in the entry process [24] , whereas human (h) APN is a receptor for the infection by HCoV-229E [29] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 494, "end": 497, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 927, "end": 931, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1257, "end": 1261, "text": "[25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1415, "end": 1419, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1931, "end": 1935, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2228, "end": 2232, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 2384, "end": 2388, "text": "[24]", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2458, "end": 2462, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cell Entry Receptors of TGEV and PEDV"}, {"text": "The reason why TGEV uses APN as an entry receptor has not been clarified. It might be linked to its abundance on the surface of epithelial cells rather than its biological function, which seems to be dispensable for CoV binding capacity [30, 31] . In the small intestine mucosa, APN occupies about 8% of the total protein content of the differentiated enterocytes [32] . For PEDV, although there are many articles in which pAPN was proposed as the recep-DOI: 10.1159/000492424 tor in PEDV infection, this view has been questioned due to the lack of robust direct evidence. The characteristic structure of APN is a large glycosylated ectodomain with a zinc metal ion at the active site, which functions as a zinc-dependent protease responsible for cleavage of the N-terminal amino acids, mediated by the HELAH motif [33] . The enzymatic function of the pAPN catalyzes the removal of amino acid residues from the N termini of oligopeptides, and APN has been termed the \"moonlighting enzyme\" because of its many cell functions. APN can be cleaved into N-terminal (95 kDa) and C-terminal (50 kDa) subunits by trypsin digestion and comprises 4 domains (DI-DIV) [29, 32] . It is heavily glycosylated and forms dimers through extensive DIV-DIV interactions. Sequence conservation in the RBD tip of \u03b1-CoVs exerts a crucial function in which the APN recognition mode is highly conserved [29] . Moreover, the specificity of APN with the recognition structure in the S protein is linked to the structure of the APN N-linked glycan and fusion with the RBD \u03b21-\u03b22 turn. In addition, the CoVs tyrosine and tryptophan residues are critical in forming the TGEV RBD-APN structure. HCoV-229E does not have a tyrosine in its RBD \u03b21-\u03b22 turn, hence it recognizes the human APN that lacks this form of glycosylation [20, 34] , meaning that HCoV-229E recognition of APN must be unique. There have been some studies that determined the structure of a protruding tip for binding to small APN cavities in this human \u03b1-CoV. The S proteins of PEDV and TGEV share high homology, but they have different host preferences. In addition, PEDV has been verified to use a different receptor recognition model compared with TGEV, PRCoV, and HCoV-NL63.

At present CoVs in \u03b1-, \u03b2-, and \u03b3-CoV have developed variant sialic acid binding activities [35] . According to current research, 3 types of sugars have been characterized as receptors or coreceptors for CoV entry into host cells: 5-Nacetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), 5-N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc), and 5-N-acetyl-9-O-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5, 9Ac2) [36] . Recognition of sugars as co-receptors of TGEV and PEDV seems to be a strategy by which these viruses adapt to the living organism, meaning that TGEV and PEDV bind to sialic acid to survive under unfavorable intestinal tract conditions. TGEV was first described to have a sialic acid binding activity in 1996 [37] . The sialic acid binding activity resides in the N-terminal portion of the S1 subunit that has been linked to the enteropathogenicity of TGEV and that is absent from the S protein of PRCoV. The sialic acid preferentially recognized by TGEV is N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) [37] . The spike protein has a trimeric structure and retains its sialic acid binding activity in soluble forms of the protein [38, 39] . TGEV recognizes and binds the sugar moieties of glycoconjugates that are highly O-glycosylated which promotes binding but is not sufficient for initiation of infection. It is believed that abundant sialic acid in mucins aids TGEV to penetrate the mucus layer and then to get access to pAPN on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells. Thus, the efficiency of infection can be enhanced under unfavorable conditions. Binding to pAPN and sialic acid are two independent processes. Interestingly, binding to pAPN is more efficient in the absence of sialic acid [40] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 191, "end": 195, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 458, "end": 462, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 773, "end": 777, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1057, "end": 1061, "text": "[37]", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1184, "end": 1188, "text": "[38,", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 1189, "end": 1192, "text": "39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 1758, "end": 1762, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Sialic Acid Promotes TGEV and PEDV Binding to Host Cell Receptors"}, {"text": "There are few studies on the binding of PEDV to sialic acids.
