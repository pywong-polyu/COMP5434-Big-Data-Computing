The patient reported new episodes of chestpain and discomfort and exercise limitation \u223c10 days after the vaccination. Initially, no medical presentation was made in the expectation that the symptoms would disappear. After a clear increase of the symptoms in the course of time, the patient presented to the emergency department of a referring hospital. The electrocardiogram on admission showed ST segment elevation in the inferior leads (II, III, and aVF). A coronary angiography was performed with exclusion of a coronary artery disease. The serum levels for C-reactive Protein [<1.0 mg/l, normal < 5.0 mg/l)] and highsensitive Troponin-I [<5.1 pg/ml, normal<34.1 pg/ml)] were normal. Creatinin kinase was increased with a serum level of 255 U/l (normal <190 U/l). Transthoracic echocardiography showed normal myocardial function without wall motion abnormalities or relevant valvular heart disease.Cardiac MRI at 1.5 Tesla showed a normal left and right ventricular size with normal left and right ventricular ejection fraction and normal values for global longitudinal strain. The examination showed a mild to moderate pericardial effusion up to 11 mm in the mid-posterior wall of the LV. There was no evidence of acute cardiac inflammation in the T2 weighted and LGE images. The global T2 relaxation time (52 ms, normal 35 to 51 ms at 1.5 Tesla) and T1 relaxation time (979 ms, normal 903 to 1,085 ms at 1.5 Tesla) were normal. In the absence of signs of acute cardiac inflammation in the T2 weighted images and the LGE images, the pericardial effusion was considered as a possible residual of an expired pericarditis/myocarditis.",
