            "text": "Rwanda has a strong immunization system, 1 a well-organized vaccine supply system and a well-functioning community health worker (CHW) programme. 2 As a result, national immunization coverage rates are high and new vaccines are introduced swiftly. 3,4 Nevertheless, some communities still face local disease outbreaks due to underimmunization. A major driver of underimmunization is vaccine hesitancy, 5 which is defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) as \"delay in acceptance or refusal of vaccination despite availability of vaccination services. \" 6 According to WHO, \"vaccine hesitancy is complex and context specific, varying across time, place, and vaccines\" and is one of the top 10 global health threats. 6, 7 Factors influencing vaccine hesitancy can be categorized using the 3Cs framework: (i) confidence; (ii) complacency; and (iii) convenience. 8 As psychological, sociological and environmental drivers are paramount in instigating the behavioural changes required to address vaccine hesitancy, 9, 10 understanding the contextual relationships between vaccine hesitancy and socioeconomic determinants of health is crucial. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Additionally, better understanding of vaccine hesitancy is needed to achieve the sustainable development goals, including universal access to quality vaccines. 17 WHO's Immunization Agenda 2030 highlights the importance of people-centredness for understanding the context-specific root causes of vaccine hesitancy and for co-designing solutions. 18, 19 However, the literature has major gaps on: (i) the analysis of human-centred design approaches; (ii) the relationship between beneficiaries and service delivery; and (iii) incorporating the interaction between hesitancy factors into policy and intervention design. 6 For our study of underimmunization drivers in a lowincome country, we focused on measles in Rwanda, because: (i) measles is highly contagious and there were indications of underimmunization; (ii) measles increases morbidity and mortality because it erases the immune memory and increases susceptibility to other infectious diseases; 20, 21 (iii) despite long-standing vaccination programmes, eradication has not been achieved globally according to the Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan 2012-2020; 22 and (iv) the second measles vaccine dose was designated a performance tracer in the Immunization Agenda 2030. 18 Moreover, the measles programme is monitored by WHO and the Rwandan government, which can provide data for future quantitative models. In Rwanda, the measles vaccination programme has been quite successful: it achieved a national coverage rate above 85% for the second measles and rubella vaccine dose in 2015 and reached the target national coverage rate of 95% for the first dose in 2017. 18, 23 The first measles and rubella vaccine dose is administered 9 months after birth and, since 2015, the second dose is administered 15 months after birth. Despite these achievements, Rwanda still faces sporadic measles outbreaks (e.g. in Western Province in 2019). 24 To inform policy design and to improve immunization levels, we aimed to study the mechanisms underlying vaccine hesitancy in Rwanda that contributed to local underimmunization for measles and a subsequent measles outbreak. We conducted an analysis of immunization service delivery Objective To investigate vaccine hesitancy leading to underimmunization and a measles outbreak in Rwanda and to develop a conceptual, community-level model of behavioural factors. Methods Local immunization systems in two Rwandan communities (one recently experienced a measles outbreak) were explored using systems thinking, human-centred design and behavioural frameworks. Data were collected between 2018 and 2020 from: discussions with 11 vaccination service providers (i.e. hospital and health centre staff ); interviews with 161 children's caregivers at health centres; and nine validation interviews with health centre staff. Factors influencing vaccine hesitancy were categorized using the 3Cs framework: confidence, complacency and convenience. A conceptual model of vaccine hesitancy mechanisms with feedback loops was developed. Findings A comparison of service providers' and caregivers' perspectives in both rural and peri-urban settings showed that similar factors strengthened vaccine uptake: (i) high trust in vaccines and service providers based on personal relationships with health centre staff; (ii) the connecting role of community health workers; and (iii) a strong sense of community. Factors identified as increasing vaccine hesitancy (e.g. service accessibility and inadequate follow-up) differed between service providers and caregivers and between settings. The conceptual model could be used to explain drivers of the recent measles outbreak and to guide interventions designed to increase vaccine uptake. Conclusion The application of behavioural frameworks and systems thinking revealed vaccine hesitancy mechanisms in Rwandan communities that demonstrate the interrelationship between immunization services and caregivers' vaccination behaviour. Confidencebuilding social structures and context-dependent challenges that affect vaccine uptake were also identified.",

Second, we conducted in-depth interviews with health centre staff and collected secondary data (e.g. on vaccine orders, inventories and disease outbreaks). Based on our findings, we interviewed children's caregivers to understand local factors influencing vaccine hesitancy. Then, we used the 3Cs framework to categorize factors reported by caregivers and health centre staff. 6 Finally, we derived causal relationships between behavioural drivers, vaccination intent and vaccination uptake by analysing the vaccine hesitancy factors identified and present these relationships in causal loop diagrams. These diagrams are helpful for understanding complex systems and for developing interventions. 29, 30 All causal relationships in the causal loop diagrams and vaccine hesitancy factors were validated and explained during additional discussions with health centre staff.",

Additional details are available from the data repository. 32 At the community level, we interviewed caregivers at two health centres: one in rural Ramba in Ngororero District, where there was a measles outbreak in 2019, and one in Gahanga in the Kicukiro District. After a measles outbreak in July 2019, one of the Ramba health centre's outreach posts became the Sovu health centre to be closer to people in the catchment area. Although these two locations share the same climate, epidemiological characteristics and health systems, they have different geographical and socioeconomic characteristics (Table 1) . We attended two vaccination sessions at health centres and one outreach vaccination session in both communities. Each caregiver present was invited to participate in the study (i.e. a convenience sample) by having a face-to-face interview in or near the session waiting room. After the purpose of the research was explained, 161 caregivers participated: they were predominantly female and included both experienced mothers and mothers of firstborns. Notes: The immunization system diagram is a high-level conceptual model of a national immunization system that was developed to engage stakeholders in immunization system assessment and sustainable redesign. 25 The left side illustrates planned immunization (i.e. routine immunization and planned immunization campaigns) guided by a national immunization plan, and the right side illustrates emergency immunization (i.e. immunization in response to disease outbreaks). Loops R1 to R4 are reinforcing feedback loops that cause change in the same direction and loops B1 and B2 are balancing loops that cause change in the opposite direction. See Decouttere et al. for more information. 25 The focal point of the immunization system diagram is vaccination and all efforts in the system are geared towards service delivery. Vaccination depends on three fundamental so-called flows that need to be synchronized at every vaccination session: (i) child (represented in the diagram by population well-being); (ii) nurse (represented by workforce and infrastructure); and (iii) vaccine (represented by vaccine distribution). Successful vaccination leads to better population health status, although only after a delay. From population health status, there are several loops that affect both planned and emergency immunization, but in different ways.",

However, in rural settings, mothers tended to deprioritize or forget immunization of older children because of other tasks and because they had little contact with health centres in the 6-month interval between the first and second measles and rubella vaccine doses. This factor increased complacency and, combined with low disease surveillance in Sovu (which led to undetected measles cases), contributed to the 2019 measles outbreak. CHWs were regarded as playing a crucial role in connecting mothers to antenatal care and vaccination services. However, concerns were raised about the sustainability of CHW programmes.",

In peri-urban settings and at district and central levels, the efficiency of, and the level of attendance at, outreach services were reported to benefit from the support of CHWs.

As vaccine uptake evolves, six feedback loops are activated (Fig. 3) : three balancing B loops and three reinforcing R loops that can increase or decrease trust, engagement or access. These loops illustrate the dynamic nature of the system. The same factors and loops were identified in both rural and peri-urban settings but their relative impact on vaccination uptake differed. For example, in rural settings, access to vaccinations was reduced by a lack of outreach services and information campaigns, whereas, in peri-urban settings, workload pressure on the immunization system had a negative impact on trust in vaccination.",

Second, in the absence of outreach services, health centres did not know which children were underimmunized. Therefore, the need for an additional immunization campaign or outreach services was not recognized. The resulting outbreak triggered a new immunization campaign and further investigations. Eventually, a new health centre was established in the affected area, which reduced the previously underimmunized population's dependency on both outreach services and immunization campaigns. The ongoing development of digital data management systems at health centres will support this change.

For example, trust in vaccination and social cohesion are factors that can be leveraged in various settings. However, the differences we identified between rural and peri-urban settings in the ease of travel indicate that solutions for vaccine hesitancy and vaccine policy design are dependent on the setting, even for the same vaccine in the same country. Both vaccination service providers (i.e. Expanded Programme on Immunization staff and CHWs) and caregivers thought that the accessibility of vaccination sessions and the quality of the immunization service were important influences behind underimmunization. However, the insights we obtained from service providers and caregivers revealed they had differing perspectives, which provided an opportunity for collective learning and for increasing vaccine uptake. Some service delivery policies had unintended consequences. For instance, according to national guidelines, multidose vaccine vials must be used at fixed sites rather than at both outreach posts and fixed sites to reduce wastage. This policy may increase vaccine hesitancy by reducing access to, or the convenience of, vaccination for people dependent on outreach services. Moreover, in some places in Rwanda, there used to be a financial penalty if a child was not registered with the vaccine system at birth. Consequently, families whose children were born at home were often deterred from visiting health centres due to misinformation that the penalty still existed. Conversely, this lasting fear of a financial penalty may incentivize some pregnant mothers to engage with vaccination.",

Causal loops can be strengthened or weakened by external elements, such as interventions made in response to a measles outbreak. For instance, communication within communities can be leveraged by prolonging CHW programmes, thereby enhancing social cohesion. In contrast, the COVID-19 pandemic induced the perception that health centre visits were unsafe. This perception, combined with the temporary cancellation of community awareness activities and educational sessions at health centres, resulted in immunization being delayed until mid-August 2020. The speed at which vaccine uptake was restored after the disruption showed the resilience of the system. 35, 36 As outreach services are a cornerstone of measles immunization programmes in some populations, their sustainability will affect future immunization programmes. The efficiency of outreach could be increased by focusing efforts on hard-to-reach populations or by establishing temporary outreach posts during the rainy season. Dependency on outreach services could be reduced by opening new health-care delivery points or by providing physical or financial support to enable caregivers to travel to health centres, both of which would enhance the sustainability of the immunization system.",

            "text": "Our study of two settings in Rwanda revealed leverage points that cut across several factors influencing vaccine hesitancy (i.e. one specific intervention can impact multiple loops within the immunization system). For example, we found that the connecting role of CHWs was pivotal and that they could function as a high-potential leverage point because they have a direct impact on two feedback loops in Fig. 3 : the balancing convenience loop (i.e. identifying the need for outreach and vaccination campaigns) and the reinforcing complacency loop (i.e. increasing awareness of the benefits of vaccination through home visits). 25 Furthermore, the digitization of local immunization data, such as the immunization status of the population (irrespective of the point of vaccination), could guide targeted and timely preventive interventions (e.g. catch-up vaccinations in the child's second year of life), assist in campaign planning and help trace defaulters. Nevertheless, the factors affecting vaccine hesitancy can change over time (e.g. in response to vaccine-hesitant social media influencers). 37 Our study has limitations. First, the presence of a well-functioning vaccination delivery system in Rwanda may make it more difficult to generalize our findings. Second, although we carefully selected the study settings, they were limited in number and our findings relate to only rural and peri-urban communities. More research is needed on urban and other settings. Third, we were not able to interview caregivers who are not present at vaccination sessions. However, interviewees were asked about the motivations of caregivers who missed sessions. Similarly, we interviewed only CHWs and other vaccination service providers who spoke on behalf of their teams, which may have introduced bias. Finally, the COVID-19 pandemic complicated fieldwork.",

M\u00e9todos Se analizaron los programas locales de vacunaci\u00f3n en dos comunidades de Ruanda (una de las que experiment\u00f3 un brote de sarampi\u00f3n hace poco) mediante el uso de marcos de pensamiento sist\u00e9mico, de dise\u00f1o centrado en el ser humano y de comportamiento. Los datos se recopilaron entre 2018 y 2020 a partir de conversaciones con 11 proveedores de servicios de vacunaci\u00f3n (es decir, personal de hospitales y de centros sanitarios); entrevistas con 161 cuidadores de ni\u00f1os en centros sanitarios; y 9 entrevistas de validaci\u00f3n con personal de centros sanitarios. Los factores que influyen en la reticencia a la vacunaci\u00f3n se clasificaron mediante el modelo de las 3 C: confianza, complacencia y conveniencia. Asimismo, se elabor\u00f3 un modelo conceptual de los mecanismos de reticencia a la vacunaci\u00f3n que incluye ciclos de retroalimentaci\u00f3n. Resultados Una comparaci\u00f3n entre las perspectivas de los proveedores de servicios y de los cuidadores, tanto en entornos rurales como periurbanos, indic\u00f3 que factores similares reforzaban la adopci\u00f3n de las vacunas: i) la gran confianza en las vacunas y en los proveedores de servicios gracias a las relaciones personales con el personal del centro sanitario; ii) el rol de conexi\u00f3n de los profesionales sanitarios de la comunidad; y iii) el gran sentido de pertenencia a la comunidad. Los factores identificados que aumentan la reticencia a las vacunas (por ejemplo, la accesibilidad a los servicios y el seguimiento insuficiente) difieren entre los proveedores de servicios y los cuidadores y entre los distintos entornos. El modelo conceptual se podr\u00eda utilizar para explicar los factores que influyeron en el reciente brote de sarampi\u00f3n y para orientar las intervenciones dise\u00f1adas con el objetivo de aumentar la adopci\u00f3n de vacunas. Conclusi\u00f3n La aplicaci\u00f3n de marcos de comportamiento y del pensamiento sist\u00e9mico revel\u00f3 mecanismos de reticencia a las vacunas en las comunidades de Ruanda que evidencian la interrelaci\u00f3n entre los servicios de vacunaci\u00f3n y el comportamiento de vacunaci\u00f3n de los cuidadores. Tambi\u00e9n se identificaron las estructuras sociales de fomento de la confianza y los desaf\u00edos espec\u00edficos del contexto que afectan a la adopci\u00f3n de las vacunas.",

For confidence, reinforcing factors represented by the R loop include: (i) respectful relationships with health centre staff and community health workers engenders trust in vaccine services; (ii) mothers overcome fear of being late for immunization when they know the nurse and feel welcome; (iii) multiple contacts between the caregiver and nurse increases trust; and (iv) an entry in the mother-and-child booklet indicating immunization has been completed is encouraging for both caregivers and their families. Balancing factors represented by the B loop include: (i) long waiting times; (ii) short contact times between nurse and caregiver, which give the nurse little time to explain vaccination (one reason was numerous administrative tasks and demands from other vaccination programmes); and (iii) suspension of educational sessions before vaccinations during the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. For complacency, reinforcing factors represented by the R loop include: (i) a well-protected population experiences fewer cases of disease, which increases the perceived benefit of vaccination and community engagement. Balancing factors represented by the B loop include: (i) a decline in cases of disease lowers both awareness of the threat to young children and the perceived importance of vaccination; and (ii) caregivers worry less about their children's health as they grow up, which increases complacency and can lead some to deprioritize their vaccination appointments. For convenience: reinforcing factors represented by the R loop include: (i) families that are healthy, literate and financially stable are more likely to understand their appointment schedule and can afford to travel to health centres to vaccinate their children. Balancing factors represented by the B loop include: (i) the risk of a disease outbreak is increased in poorly protected populations (which can be remedied by immunization campaigns and enhanced vaccination services, including outreach).",
