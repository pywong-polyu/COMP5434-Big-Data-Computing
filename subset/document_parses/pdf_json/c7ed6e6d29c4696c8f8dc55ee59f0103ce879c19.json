Central to this model is the advent of a fractional exponent \u03b3, typically fitted to the data. While various motivations for this non-analytical form have been proposed, it is still considered foremost an empirical fitting procedure. Here, we find that Richards-like growth laws emerge naturally from generic analytical growth rules in a distributed population, upon inclusion of (i) migration (spatial diffusion) amongst different locales, and (ii) stochasticity in the growth rate, also known as \"seascape noise.\" The latter leads to a wide (power-law) distribution in local population number that, while smoothened through the former, can still result in a fractional growth law for the overall population. This justification of the Richards growth law thus provides a testable connection to the distribution of constituents of the population.",

(2) should in principle include reproductive stochasticity. While there are many kinds of randomness that may influence population growth (e.g., demographic noise, with amplitude proportional to \u221a y [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] ), we are interested in what is called Seascape Noise [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] . This noise arises from observing that the fitness \u00b5 of a population is not necessarily a static, uniform quantity. Population fitness can vary based on minor environmental conditions, access to resources, microscopic mutation rates, and other such factors. So we generalize from a static fitness landscape \u00b5(x) to one that varies in time \u00b5(x, t), much as the sea surface changes in time. By introducing seascape noise into the Fisher equation, we obtain the Seascape Fisher Equation",

II we introduce a discretization of the model, replacing y(x) with y i for locations (nodes) i = 1, . . . , N . In the context of this model diffusion between neighboring sites can be replaced with migration between any pair of sites at rates M ij . A mean-field limit is then obtained if migration rates are equal between any pair of sites (M ij = D/N ). This limit was considered by us [79] in the context of population extinction, and similar models by others in different contexts [69, 70, 77, 80, 81] . The steady steady (long-time) limit of the probability distribution \u03c1(y) can be obtained exactly in this meanfield limit, and characterized by a power-law distribution. A wide power-law distribution, characterized by non-analytic dependencies of its moments, suggests a natural route for obtaining Richards-like growth. Unfortunately, we could not solve the full dynamic behavior of the model, even in the meanfield limit. As an alternative, in Sec. III we introduce a model which alternates the linear and nonlinear parts of the model. This seasonal growth model retains the features of seascape stochasticity and migration which we believe are the cause of Richards growth, and (with some assumptions) is exactly solvable; numerical simulations confirm these expectations. In Sec. IV we consider a number of extensions: providing a procedure for testing the model by examining the dependence of the second moment on the mean (Sec. IV A); indicating the universality of the results for generalized growth equations (Sec. IV B); numerical studies of the seascape Fisher equation in one and two dimensions (Sec. IV C); and finally indicating the appearance of Gompertz growth in the strong noise limit (Sec. IV D). The concluding Sec. V provides an overview, and outlook for future studies.",

This anomalous scaling in steady state is what motivated our hypothesis for Richards growth. However, absent a solution of the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation, we cannot identify parameter regimes where the previous scaling holds away from steady state. As such, we introduce a seasonal model that allows us to take advantage of the results of this section. A justification for employing the steady-state solution in a dynamic setting comes from the case of population decay for \u00b5 = 0: If we take the scaling, y 2 \u221d y 1+min(c D ,1) , from the stationary-state, and assume that it is maintained quasi-statically during the decay process, we can make a prediction for the decay of the mean. In particular, \u2202 t y = \u2212a y 2 \u221d \u2212 y 1+c D , indicates that the mean should scale as t \u22121/c D . The numerical results plotted in Fig. 2 , indicate a power-law decay roughly consistent with the this quasi-static approximation. A similar argument is made in Ref. [84] where power-law decays as in the quasi-static assumption during growth, we next introduce a two-state model next that allows to more controllably take advantage of this solution.",

The complexities of an evolving probability distribution invalidate the quasistatic result. It may be possible that a more delicate treatment of the Fokker-Planck equation can help identify an effective Richards exponent. The study of growth laws, or even statics, for the seascape Fisher equa-tion in finite dimensions is also interesting, and may have connections to directed percolation [92] and directed polymers in random media [93, 94] .",

Deterministic ODEs can be treated with a variety of robust, accurate, and relatively simple methods, such as the fourth-order Runge-Kutta approach. In the stochastic case, we employ a method heavily inspired by that in Ref. [84] : The method we use involves splitting up the dynamics of the stochastic PDE dy = (\u00b5y \u2212 ay 2 + D\u2207 2 y)dt + \u03c3ydW ,into pieces which can be solved individually.

For mean-field, \u2207 2 y =\u0233 \u2212y, while for a one dimensional lattice with unit spacing,Finally, we take the output of this diffusion step and at each node apply a logistic growth, according toFor a more complicated growth dynamics such as what is discussed in Section IV B, we will resort to using a routine Runge-Kutta solver, as implemented in MATLAB's ode45 function, to circumvent the lack of an available analytic solution.

At the start of the phase, we assume a distribution of the form \u03c1(y) \u221d\u03c1(y) = y \u22122\u2212c D for \u03a5 \u2264 y \u2264 \u039b, and 0 otherwise.The evolution of each node during the growth phase follows a deterministic logistic growth. In particular, the population of a node after time T g is given bywhere y f = \u00b5/a is the saturation for logistic growth.The average population at the end of the growth phase is then obtained asTherefore,(B3) where we define M = y f /(e \u00b5Tg \u2212 1). It should be noted that there isn't a particularly convenient closed form for the integral as presented. Moreover, since we assume 0 < c D < 1, the integral diverges as (T g ) \u2212c D for small times, meaning that it is sometimes more convenient to split the integral asFor example, in the special case of \u039b \u2192 \u221e, then this manipulation would become necessary, since the second integral would take on a term of O(1) in time. This leads to an anomalous growth term, where y(t) \u2212 y(0) \u221d t c D , which emphasizes the importance of the upper cutoff.If \u039b is finite, and we only care about first order in time, then we indeed can just take the expectation of both sides of the logistic growth equation and find y(T g ) \u2212 y(0) T g = \u00b5 y(0) \u2212 a y(0) 2 + O(T g ).(B4) Expanding the relevant integrals givesSince 1\u2212c D > 0 and \u039b \u03a5, we can trivially expand this out as",
