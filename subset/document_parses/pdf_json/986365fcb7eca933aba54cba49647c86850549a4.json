By adjusting the parameters and observing the change of the results, we found that the modified model is more in line with the actual needs and has higher credibility in the comprehensive analysis. The assessment shows that the number of confirmed cases worldwide will reach about 20 million optimistically. In severe cases, the peak value will exceed 80 million, and the late stage of the epidemic shows a long tail shape, lasting more than one and a half years. The effective way to control the global epidemic is to strengthen international cooperation and to impose international travel restrictions and other measures.",

            "text": "The scientists and researchers have focused on dynamic models of epidemic transmission in network environment. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Many researchers describe the network topology of potential contacts as a random network, and use the susceptible-exposed-infectious-recovered (SEIR) model to analyze and predict the spread of epidemics. [19] [20] [21] [22] These studies were based on a seminal work of modeling the SEIR epidemics on a random network in 2013. 23 Compared with the classical uniform mixture model, the stochastic network can describe the heterogeneity of contact quantity more realistically and accurately. Compared with classic methods, the network dynamics model reflects the complexity of the real world and can describe the characteristics and dynamics of virus transmission among different groups in different regions better. Recently mathematical modeling includes references [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] . International air travel contributed to the international spread of the virus, and its elimination and control have got global attention. 30 It's unreasonable to illustrate the influence of the pandemic propagation purely in regard to the geographical distance. Therefore, Brockmann et al. 23 proposed a notion called effective distance and its computation method to replace traditional geographical distance, which was successfully applied to explain the trend of the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and 2003 SARS epidemic. Using the concept, complex spatiotemporal patterns can be reduced to surprisingly simple, homogeneous wave propagation patterns.",

Based on Equation (2.5), we introduced a control factor \u03be , and propose the following optimal mode: we define \u03be to simulate the heterogeneous control factor, reflecting the intensity of disease prevention and control.

By setting appropriate parameters, the simulation results of the network dynamics epidemic transmission model introducing a heterogeneous control factor could fit well with the actual epidemic situation in major countries in the world, and the effectiveness of the improved model was obtained. If we only analyze the possible consequences of the epidemic, we can set other parameter values.F I G U R E 6 There is a positive correlation between the dates of the first reported cases and the effective distance between China and others Theoretical value of infected population in major countries worldwide Compared with the original model. The improved model is closer to the needs of reality and has higher credibility in comprehensive analysis. However, for a country, the influence of other countries on it is dynamic and cannot be described quantitatively. In this model, a comprehensive control factor is used instead of multiple factors related to specific measures, which can greatly reduce the difficulty of the model and has no impact on the analysis of the problem. Now there is the risk of a multi-point outbreak in the global epidemic situation. The effective way to stop the global epidemic is to strengthen international cooperation and to impose international travel restrictions and other measures. The spread of the epidemic situation has broughthuge losses to the economy of various countries.

The proposed model applied the classical SEIR model to the network based on effective distance and was modified by introducing a heterogeneous control factor with temporal and spatial characteristics. International aviation data were approximately used to estimate the flux fraction matrix, and the effective distance was calculated. Through parameter estimation and simulation, the theoretical values of the modified model fit well with practical values. By adjusting the parameters and observing the change of the results, we found that the modified model is more in line with the actual needs and has higher credibility in the comprehensive analysis.
