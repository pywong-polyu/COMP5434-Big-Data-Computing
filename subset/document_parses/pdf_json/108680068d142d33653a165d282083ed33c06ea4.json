The differential equation depends from another positive parameter in mixed derivatives. With respect to first variable this equation is a fractional-order nonhomogeneous differential equation in the positive part of the considering segment, and with respect to second variable is a second-order differential equation with spectral parameter in the negative part of this segment. Using the Fourier series method, the solutions of direct and inverse boundary value problems are constructed in the form of a Fourier series. Theorems on the existence and uniqueness of the problem are proved for regular values of the spectral parameter. It is proved the stability of the solution with respect to redefinition functions, and with respect to parameter given in mixed derivatives. For irregular values of the spectral parameter, an infinite number of solutions in the form of a Fourier series are constructed.",
