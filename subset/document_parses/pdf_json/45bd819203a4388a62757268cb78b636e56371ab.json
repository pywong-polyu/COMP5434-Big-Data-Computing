Many kinds of mammals, such as hedgehog, pangolin, civet, and bat, can serve as storage hosts of coronavirus [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Six CoVs have been identified to be pathogenic, including four endemic (HCoV-OC43, \u2212229E, \u2212NL63, and -HKU1) and two epidemic (SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV) viruses [7, 8] . A cluster of cases of pneumonia was reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019. On 11 February 2020, the diseases named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), and Coronavirus Study Group (CSG) of the International Committee proposed to name the new coronavirus as SARS-CoV-2. Up to 2 March 2020, at least 80 151 cases were reported (http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2020-03/03/content_5486171.htm). Most of the patients had a history of visiting Hubei Province or contacting people who had ever stayed in or passed by Hubei Province, or were exposed to symptoms [9] . Some patients got infected through only asymptomatic contact. This study aimed to report the epidemic features and lab identification of a patient confirmed with COVID-19 infection through only asymptomatic contact (Fig. 1 ).",

His PCR test was positive, but the test for seasonal influenza and adenovirus infection was negative, despite flulike symptoms and pneumonia during the first week of illness. In this case report, the COVID-19 infection was diagnosed by a PCR test or based on clinical symptoms combined with a CT scan [10] . The duration from infection to the appearance of symptoms of SARS-CoV-2 was not exactly known [11] . Generally, it was thought to be 14 days, but a research group at Guangzhou reported the longest incubation period of 24 days [12] . In addition, asymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is an important topic and asymptomatic infections of SARS-CoV-2 could complicate disease control [13] . The report of \"Diamond Princess\" showed that a large number of asymptomatic carriers might remain undiscovered in the community [14] . Mao et al. reported that the asymptomatic ratio of COVID-19 was 2.6% (2 out of 78 confirmed cases) [15] . Nishiura et al. estimated 41.6% of cases among 565 Japanese individuals evacuated from Wuhan, China were asymptomatic case [16] . As of 4 April 2020, 150 asymptomatic case out of 915 confirmed cases were reported in Hong Kong, giving a ratio of 16.4% [17] . Hu et al. provided evidence for transmission from an asymptomatic infector to close contacts that result in severe COVID-19 pneumonia [18] . These findings suggest that asymptomatic carriers should be considered a source of COVID-19 infection. In this study, the patient's wife, son, parents, and brother's family had no symptoms or signs between 5 January and 18 February 2020. After the patient was hospitalized, RT-PCR tests of his wife, son, brother, and brother's wife performed once every other day were negative. Their PCR results were negative probably because the virus was eliminated due to the longtime interval or the viral load was too low to be detected, or the test results were false negative. Moreover, the patient's parents and nephews A and B did not undergo the RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV-2 infection, and hence whether they were carriers was not confirmed. No suspected or confirmed cases were reported in Nanchang within 14 days of the departure of the patient from the site on 23 January. Therefore, it was difficult to predict who might have passed the virus to the patient; any of the relatives could have served as an intermediary of the virus except for his wife and son (Fig. 7) .",
