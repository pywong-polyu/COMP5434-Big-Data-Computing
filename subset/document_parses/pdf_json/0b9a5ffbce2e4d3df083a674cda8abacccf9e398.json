Quarantine is considered an effective measure for the prevention and control of epidemics, since they restrict the movement of people and therefore can slow the spread of the disease. Nevertheless, quarantine can cause several issues, including an increase in psychological burden due to reduced contact with the outside world (7), as well as an increase in mental health disorders due to reduced physical activity and increased economic pressure (8) . During quarantine, individuals may be more likely to experience negative emotional and behavioral problems, such as despair, anxiety, guilt, insomnia, anger, fear, alcoholism, and smoking (9) (10) (11) . Social isolation and the lack of interpersonal communication can also lead to, or aggravate, depression (12) .",

For example, the COVID-19 outbreak in Pi County, Chengdu City had a strong impact on the local population, and much of the population was quarantined a second time in late 2020, for periods ranging from December 8, 2020 to December 22, 2020 . In this study, we investigated the psychological impact of repeated home quarantine on the Chinese population in Pi County during the COVID-19 pandemic. We are not aware of other studies addressing the effect of repeated quarantine on the risk of anxiety, depression, or PTSD.

Anxiety and PTSD are typically associated with long-term stress. For example, extended exposure to stress can significantly increase one's anxiety levels, which may lead to PTSD (17) . After implementing several epidemic control measures to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, many cities in Western China relaxed their regulations on blockades, thus reducing the panic experienced by the general population. Many people even reported that the epidemic seemed far away from them (18) . Another reason is that the observed lack of association between quarantine times and symptoms of anxiety or stress in our study may reflect the presence of family support. Chinese people generally have more family support (19) . Such support can significantly reduce anxiety and PTSD. Future work should focus on gaining a better understanding of the impact of pandemic prevention measures such as quarantine on the anxiety and PTSD levels, and it should explore factors that can prevent or mitigate the negative effects of such measures.",

At onset, individuals with hikikomori tend not to suffer and are satisfied because they have escaped realworld stresses. However, longer lasting social isolation gradually increases loneliness (28) . According to theories of perceived isolation, the need for social connectedness is deeply ingrained in humans and has evolved along with neural, hormonal, and genetic mechanisms that are directly associated with bonding and companionship. Herd behavior is another crucial factor for survival and reproduction (29) . Being social is a human tendency that facilitates interaction: restriction of our movements can lead to psychological distress (22) . Thus, as with hikikomori, repeated home quarantine can lead to subjective feelings of loneliness and social isolation. Subjective social isolation and loneliness were found closely related to symptoms of depression and suicidal thoughts, this is a key risk factor for depression and some serious consequences (26, 30) .",

In this regard, we believe that the original hikikomori support programs may serve as an important reference. It developed a family based educational program to reduce the risk of family violence, suicide, and other mental disturbances due to hikikomori, using lectures and role play sessions (31) . Generally, home quarantine is based on family units. So, this method is also applicable for them and is a good way to reduce the negative consequences. However, making preventive plans for these problems is not an easy task. In Asian countries, fears are probably deeply rooted in traditional-culture-based shame and social ostracism. Asian countries have higher stigma of mental illness, and patients are more likely to be ostracized by society. Therefore, they are less likely to seek help from psychiatrists or psychologists when dealing with emotional problems such as symptoms of depression (28, 32) . As a result, we can increase efforts such as lectures, community training and online educational outreach to raise public awareness about mental illness, which may help reduce stigma and prevent its consequences.",

A long-term study of social networks showed that enduring emotional states of depression and happiness can be transmitted through the Internet (41) .

During the pandemic, many people have expressed their fears, worries, and other negative emotions on social media.
