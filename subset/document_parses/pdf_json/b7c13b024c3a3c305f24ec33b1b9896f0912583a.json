Several cases of reinfection with SARS-CoV-2 have been documented 48-142 days after the initial infection and immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses is estimated to be shorter than 1 year. Using an age-structured, deterministic model, we explore potential immunity dynamics using contact data from the UK population. In the scenario where immunity to SARS-CoV-2 lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalized individuals, a year for hospitalized individuals, and the effective reproduction number after lockdown ends is 1.2 (our worst-case scenario), we find that the secondary peak occurs in winter 2020 with a daily maximum of 387 000 infectious individuals and 125 000 daily new cases; threefold greater than in a scenario with permanent immunity. Our models suggest that longitudinal serological surveys to determine if immunity in the population is waning will be most informative when sampling takes place from the end of the lockdown in June until autumn 2020. After this period, the proportion of the population with antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 is expected to increase due to the secondary wave. Overall, our analysis presents considerations for policy makers on the longer-term dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 in the UK and suggests that strategies designed to achieve herd immunity may lead to repeated waves of infection as immunity to reinfection is not permanent.",

Antibodies raised in hospitalized patients and animal models against SARS-CoV-2 provide protection for at least several weeks following infection [8, 9] , suggesting that immediate reinfection with the virus is unlikely. There is limited evidence that hospitalized patients with more severe symptoms show a greater antibody response [6, 9] . Asymptomatic individuals have a weaker IgG and specific antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 and are more likely to become seronegative following convalescence [10] . Antibody titres raised against related coronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been shown to decay over time [11, 12] . Furthermore, immunity to seasonal circulating coronaviruses has been estimated to last for less than 1 year [13] and recovered individuals from coronavirus NL63 can become reinfected [14] . Concerns that immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may also wane therefore motivated the present study [15] .",

Many models or simulations have assumed that infected individuals recover with permanent immunity [16] [17] [18] . In such models, the epidemic reaches extinction after running out of infected individuals, although they do not preclude a second wave of infections after lockdown [19] . If immunity wanes over a period of time, or recovered individuals have only partial immunity to reinfection, this substantially alters the dynamics of the system [20] . In the absence of stochastic extinction and demography (births and deaths) in a population with equal mixing where R 0 is the basic reproduction number, \u03b3 is the average duration of infection and \u03c9 is the reciprocal of the average duration of immunity, the endemic equilibrium proportion of infected in the population, I*, is given by (R 0 \u2212 1)\u03c9/\u03b3R 0 and thus, in the absence of interventions, the infection persists indefinitely when R 0 > 1 [21] .",

As R 0 for SARS-CoV-2 is generally estimated between 2.4 and 5.6 [22] [23] [24] , this equates to 58-82% of the population requiring immunity to eventually halt the epidemic. Serological studies conducted in affected countries to-date have reported the proportion of the population with antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 to be much lower than this figure [22, 25] . However, when more realistic non-homogeneous mixing is considered, the observed immunity threshold is lower than the classical threshold [26] . Recent studies have considered this question for SARS-CoV-2 [27, 28] , with Britton et al. [28] noting that the disease-induced population immunity threshold could be closer to 40% in an age-structured population when R 0 is 2.5, rather than the 60% 'classic' population immunity threshold. This phenomenon is driven by individuals who have more contacts, or greater susceptibility to the virus, getting infected earlier on and leaving the susceptible population, thus decelerating the growth of the epidemic.",

Following the first infection in March, the patient was discharged from hospital after two negative PCR results. Genomic sequencing confirmed that the viruses in March and August were from distinct clades. Reinfections have since been reported in single cases in the USA [31], Ecuador [32] and Belgium [33] at 48, 63 and 93 days, respectively, from the first reported infections. Two asymptomatic reinfections were also reported in Indian healthcare workers 108 and 111 days from the initial infection [34] . The case of reinfection in the USA, in a 25-year-old male from Nevada, was notable for the second infection causing more severe symptoms than the first, and led to the patient requiring supplemental oxygen and hospitalization.

We decided to use a discrete time implementation (difference equations), as this permits greater flexibility in implementing interventions compared to differential equations. Using difference equations results in a discretized approximation of the Erlang distribution compared with continuous time models, with the output converging as the time step approaches zero [49, 50] .

Intervention measures are initiated on the 23rd of March (date the UK nationwide lockdown started), with an immediate reduction in the effective reproduction number (expected number of secondary cases from an index case at time t; R t ) to 1.2 for a three week period, followed by a further reduction in R t to 0.8 until lockdown measures are eased on 15th June [42] . After this time, R t is brought to 0.9, 1, 1.1 or 1.2 until March 2022. We considered the majority of our analysis over a (relatively short) 2-year period to explore the epidemic up to a secondary peak; beyond this point the dynamics are likely to be altered depending on further interventions or changes to R t . As we simulate disease dynamics over a relatively short period of time, we do not consider demography (births and deaths) or transitions between age classes (ageing). To obtain equilibrium values, we simulated epidemic trajectories for up to 5 years. The UK contact matrix (average daily contacts between a single individual in age group j with individuals in age group i) comes from a 'citizen science' project for the BBC, in which royalsocietypublishing.org/journal/rstb Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 376: 20200274 individuals in the UK population provided detailed information on their daily contacts in the home, in the workplace, at school and in other settings [43, 44] . The contact matrix is altered to account for changes to contact patterns during and after the main intervention period [37] . During the lockdown, home, work, school, and other contacts are reduced to 0.8, 0.3, 0.1 and 0.2, respectively, of their baseline values. This reflects the school closures for all children, except for those of key workers, and that workers were encouraged to work from home. Reduction in home contacts accounts for the absence of visitors to the home during the lockdown. In the post-lockdown phase, home, work, school, and other contacts are scaled to 1, 0.8, 0.85 and 0.75, respectively, of their baseline values to reflect limited social distancing measures that are likely to be in place until at least the end of 2021.",

This is described by the next generation matrix in which the average number of secondary cases generated by an index case in age group j is the summation of row j (equation (2.8) and figure 3 ). At the beginning of the epidemic, when SARS-CoV-2 is spreading rapidly, all age groups are involved in transmission; in particular those aged 20-39 years. An index case in the 20-24 age group, for instance, is expected to generate an average of 4.3 secondary cases at baseline. As lockdown measures come into force this dramatically reduces the expected number of secondary cases due to fewer contacts and a lower probability of infection given contact. The average number of secondary cases from an individual aged 20-24 during lockdown drops to 0.9 and the transmission parameter \u03b2, which captures the probability of infection given contact, is decreased from 0.18 at baseline to 0.11. In the post-lockdown period, daily contacts are increased to a higher proportion of their baseline values (see \u00a72); in order to keep the reproduction number equal to the dominant eigenvalue of the next generation matrix, \u03b2 is consequently reduced to 0.05 when R t =0.9 and to 0.07 when R t =1.2. This implies that, to maintain R t below one when more contacts are occurring in the population post-lockdown, the probability that contact results in infection will need to be reduced.",

In our worst-case scenario (S4: short-lived immunity) where immunity lasts an average of three months for non-hospitalized patients, a year for hospitalized patients and R t following lockdown is 1.2, then the secondary peak will exceed the initial peak with a maximum of 387 000 infectious individuals and 125 000 daily new cases in December 2020. This is threefold greater than the number of new cases in scenario S1 where immunity is permanent; the maximum number of infectious individuals in the secondary peak is 126 000 and there are 41 000 daily new cases (figure 4g). We note that the timing of the secondary peak in infection curves across immunological scenarios is closely synchronized and in winter 2020-2021. This synchrony and timing are also observed during the epidemic when values of R t post-lockdown are greater than 1.2 (explored for values of R t from 1.3 to 2.0).",

A higher proportion of individuals aged between 20 and 39 are infected early in the epidemic, and this leads to 12.4-13.9% of individuals in these age groups having antibodies by October 2020 when immunity is life-long (figure 5b). When immunity wanes, however, by October 2020 this drops to 6.7-7.8% (figure 5d), thus replenishing the pool of susceptible individuals with the age groups that disproportionately drive transmission. This causes the secondary peak of infectious cases to rise more rapidly and to a greater height when immunity wanes rapidly (figure 5c), compared with permanent immunity (figure 5a). Our models suggest that the age distribution of cases in the epidemic will not change greatly over time; as seen in figure 5 , the ordering of the proportion of each age group infected remains constant in both scenarios of permanent and shortlived immunity.",

In simulations where R t equals one, if immunity is permanent then the epidemic becomes extinct in May 2022.

We predict that surveys to detect waning immunity at the population level would be most effective when carried out in the period between the end of lockdown and autumn 2020, as after this point an upsurge in cases is expected that will increase the proportion of the population with immunity to SARS-CoV-2. In particular, this will allow evaluation of whether specific antibodies generated against the virus are short-lived if reductions in antibody prevalence are observed at the population level.",

This prediction is borne out by serological data from Switzerland, which showed that individuals aged 20-49 years were significantly more likely to be seropositive in May 2020 compared with younger and older age groups [64] . We postulate that 'key workers' in the UK population who have continued to work during the lockdown are more likely to have antibodies against SARS-CoV-2. Higher immunity among individuals of working age has the effect of slowing the subsequent epidemic when immunity is permanent. Conversely, when immunity wanes, previously infected individuals of working age rejoin the susceptible pool and so contribute again to transmission, leading to a high growth rate and a larger secondary peak of infected cases. In these circumstances, efforts to suppress transmission will be challenging in the absence of a transmission-blocking vaccine [15] . We note that the model structure developed here is capable of simulating the impact of vaccination with a vaccine that provides temporary transmission-blocking immunity, and could be used to predict the optimal timing for booster shots.",

This shows the importance of timely and accurate estimates of R t to inform control strategies, and ensuring widespread community testing and contact tracing is in place. Our calculations show that to suppress R t below one when contact rates rise to a higher fraction of baseline ( pre-lockdown) values, the probability of infection given contact (represented by the \u03b2 parameter) must drop by around half. Interventions that have the potential to reduce the probability of infection include social distancing, regular hand washing and the wearing of face masks outside the home [65] .",

In scenarios where immunity wanes and R t following lockdown is greater than one, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic never reaches extinction due to herd immunity, but rather the number of infected cases oscillates with subsequent waves of infection before reaching endemic equilibrium (table 2) . Even in simulations where the post-lockdown reproduction number only narrowly exceeds one (R t =1.1), if immunity wanes over an average of 1 year for severe cases and three months for non-severe cases, this is projected to lead to an equilibrium state of nearly 40 000 daily new cases and 500 daily admissions to intensive care. Policy strategies aiming to achieve herd immunity are therefore risky [5] . As individuals can lose their immunity and become reinfected with SARS-CoV-2, a stable population immunity threshold can never be reached in the absence of a vaccine with lifelong efficacy [21] . The establishment of an endemic equilibrium state is dependent on no future interventions or changes to R t , which we consider unlikely as policy makers and public health agencies are likely to react to future outbreaks with localized control measures.",

Even with this consideration, there are many probability distributions that can be used to capture a median duration of immunity, and our selection of an Erlang distribution with a shape parameter of two is somewhat arbitrary. Our assumptions on the duration of the latent and infectious periods are more closely informed by estimates from data [35] [36] [37] . We made the decision to capture the expected duration of these states as a discretized Erlang distribution rather than the more conventional exponential distribution. This has the benefit of closely replicating fitted gamma or log-normal distributions within a compartmental model [46] , and has important implications for the dynamics of the epidemic [66, 67] . We make a number of assumptions regarding the natural history of the virus, such as the relative susceptibility of children compared with adults and the relative infectiousness of symptomatic versus asymptomatic cases based on the current literature [40, 45] . Future empirical studies are likely to add to and further refine these epidemiological parameters. After we completed the analysis, a study of 37 asymptomatic individuals in China found that they had a longer period of viral shedding when compared with symptomatic individuals [10] . While viral shedding is not necessarily indicative of transmission potential [7] , if these findings are replicated in larger studies, this may suggest a need to use different durations of infectiousness for asymptomatic and symptomatic infections in subsequent models.",

            "text": "We have aimed to capture future infection dynamics at a national level in the UK under a range of scenarios. Our analysis is limited by not considering regional differences in transmission rates, for instance through a patch (metapopulation) model [44] , or a stochastic approach that allows for local extinction events [21] . There are no deaths in our model, either from demography or infection. Accounting for mortality would mainly affect dynamics in the oldest age group (over 70 years) [16, 61] , and the higher probability of disease-induced mortality would reduce the build up of immunity in this age group (figure 5d). We also do not explicitly consider transmission in settings such as schools, hospitals or care homes, although such dynamics may be captured indirectly through the contact matrix. Given the simplicity of the model structure, we advise against treating the output as an exact prediction of the future. In addition to the limitations listed above, the epidemic trajectory will be substantially altered by any future interventions such as a return to full lockdown conditions, or intensive contact tracing and isolation [29, 68] . We emphasize that the average duration of immunity following recovery impacts substantially on epidemic growth following the easing of nonpharmaceutical interventions, and that slight differences in R t above or below one can lead to qualitatively different infection dynamics. Concerns were raised by Profs Wendy Barclay & Paul Kellam of Imperial College London in March 2020 that, based on parallels with other coronaviruses, immunity generated against SARS-CoV-2 may not be permanent and subsequent reinfection may be possible. This was considered especially likely for individuals that had mild or asymptomatic infections, as these individuals may generate lower titres of specific antibodies against the virus (see [15] ).",
