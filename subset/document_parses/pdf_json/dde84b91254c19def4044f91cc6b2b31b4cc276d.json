Pinfield et al.'s (2016) analysis of APC payment records provided by 23 United Kingdom (UK) higher education institutions revealed a sharp increase in central payments from 2007-2013, which was largely attributed to the introduction of block grants by Research Councils UK (RCUK) and non-compliance sanctions by the Wellcome Trust. Moreover, the study showed that OA fees were paid almost exclusively through block grants (92%), and only a small number of APCs were paid through internal funding (7%). In contrast, a recent Springer Nature survey found that authors draw on a range of funding sources to cover OA fees, such as dedicated institutional OA funds, block grants, OA agreements, or research grants (Monaghan et al., 2020) . Most hybrid OA authors were supported through dedicated institutional OA funds (43%, excluding block grants) and OA agreements with Springer Nature (34%). The differences between these two studies might be due to different policy and funding arrangements-considering the introduction of OA agreements since Pinfield et al. (2016) and Monaghan et al.'s (2020) more regionally diverse sample.",

In particular, the study revealed large differences in the amount of hybrid OA funded from 2014-2015. Whilst hybrid OA accounted for less than 1% of APCs paid by German institutions (23 of 3,846), the three non-German research funders recorded a hybrid share of 75% (11,533 of 15,779) . According to Jahn & Tullney (2016) , this could point towards differences in science policy, such as hybrid OA being supported by the three non-German research funders but not by Germany's largest national funder, the German Research Foundation (DFG). Another possibility is that German hybrid OA fees were paid from budgets not reported to the Open APC initiative, a crowd-sourcing effort (Pieper & Broschinski, 2018) from where the authors acquired data. Among these unreported funds are research grants and research unit budgets, which author surveys identified as APC funding sources (Graaf, 2017; Monaghan et al., 2020) . As such, Jahn and Tullney's (2016) findings could reflect the complexities and potential limitations of institutional OA spending data that Pinfield et al. (2016) and Monaghan et al. (2020) attributed to incomplete or missing records.",

Elsevier supports delayed (Elsevier, n.d.-b), hybrid, and full OA, including so-called mirror journals-full OA counterparts of hybrid journals addressing OA policies opposed to hybrid OA (Harrison, 2019) . Further, Elsevier processes APC invoices through various channels, such as agreements with research funders and library consortia or, in the absence thereof, the authors (Elsevier, n.d.-a, n.d.-c) . Surprisingly, we found Elsevier article-level metadata embedded in XML full-texts indicating the articles' OA status and invoicing. Leveraging this publicly available data, we address the lack of transparency around hybrid OA noted in previous studies. In particular, we use this novel approach to answer the following questions:",

We identified Elsevier hybrid journals through Elsevier's APC list and supplemented our sample with Crossref metadata and text-mined invoicing data to investigate the invoicing of immediate OA articles provided under a Creative Commons (CC) license in subscription-based journals. Figure 1 visualizes the automated workflow we used to collect data from Elsevier and Crossref. We identified OA articles through CC licenses in Crossref metadata records (Hendricks et al., 2020) and then downloaded the XML version of all CC-licensed articles published in a hybrid journal. From the XML files, we obtained the articles' OA status and invoicing information (see Table 1 ). We determined whether articles were immediate or delayed OA using the XML node openArchiveArticle and measured the uptake of hybrid OA. Moreover, we obtained the invoice channels and recipients of hybrid OA APCs. Using the openaccessSponsorType node, we distinguished between four invoice channels, including invoices billed to authors, as part of publishing agreements with funding bodies (cf. Elsevier (n.d.-a)), exempted through fee waivers (e.g., in \"cases of genuine need\" or due to society or university sponsorships, cf. Elsevier, n.d.-c), and other types not specified by Elsevier. Finally, when hybrid APCs were invoiced as part of agreements, we identified invoice recipients through the openaccessSponsorName node. We manually classified invoice recipients based on their institutional sectors, countries, and primary research areas. Following the OECD's Frascati Manual (OECD, 2015, p. 91), we coded for four sectors: business enterprise, government, higher education, and private non-profit. Due to the low article volume, we combined the business enterprise sector with invoice recipients Elsevier listed as \"authors\" and \"third-party sponsor\" into \"Others\". Moreover, we categorized invoice recipients according to the countries representing their scope of funding and based on the following primary research areas health sciences, life sciences, physical sciences and mathematics, social sciences and humanities, broad (i.e., multiple research areas), and unknown. Further, we compared Elsevier's invoicing data with institutional spending data from the Open APC initiative.",

Likewise, the majority of articles in materials science, chemistry and physics and astronomy were not invoiced to authors but facilitated through agreements or waived.

Our results indicate that although the number of hybrid OA articles has increased over time, its uptake has remained low. Notably, hybrid APCs were most often invoiced directly to the authors, followed by agreements, where only a few funding bodies were the primary drivers of hybrid OA. Finally, our findings highlight that publisher-provided metadata about the invoicing channels of (hybrid) OA can facilitate research into and increase the understanding of the financial flows of OA publishing.",

This study presented a novel approach to studying APC invoicing that is based on publicly available publisher-provided metadata, which can be used on on its own or in combination with other public data sources to gain more detailed and comprehensive insights into hybrid OA uptake and invoicing. If more publishers reported OA invoicing on the article level and in a machine-readable format, this would increase transparency and improve monitoring of the scholarly journal landscape over time. As hybrid OA has become a central element of OA policies of research funders and libraries, consumer organizations could require that invoicing information is added to the article-level metadata. As long as publishers do not provide this data in a structured and comprehensive format, they prevent benchmarking prices and therefore hinder competition.",

Notably, the upper quartiles and whiskers stretch farther over the years, which indicates that the range of uptake among journals with an above-average proportion of OA articles increased over the years.

            "text": "pointing to the impact of science policy. To promote OA, the UK implemented centralized APC funding and embraced hybrid OA as a transition model. Within five years of the publication of the Finch Report in 2012, the UK recorded an 18% increase in immediate OA, coupled with a rise in hybrid OA from 2.7% in 2012 to 15.4% of all articles in 2016(Jubb et al., 2017), which can be attributed to the availability of funding from RCUK. Indeed, RCUK block grants have been the largest single source of APC funds in the UK-the Wellcome Trust, and more recently transformative agreements(Jubb et al., 2017;Tickel, 2018). However, since then publishing expenditures of UK universities have been rising rapidly(Jubb et al., 2017), so that several universities stopped supporting hybrid OA in late 2018-2019 (University of Birmingham, n.d.;Walker, 2019). This development might explain the slight decrease in hybrid articles invoiced to the UK our data showed around that time (seeFigure 7).Through this study we demonstrated the utility and benefits of publisher-provided metadata about hybrid OA invoicing and highlighted the need for extending these to include comprehensive information about licensing and APC waivers. Metadata guidance should also consider the substantial amount of delayed OA content, which needs to be distinguished from hybrid OA. Hence, our study substantiates the recommendations from the Efficiency and Standards for Article Charges (ESAC)Initiative that seek to increase efficiency and transparency through improved invoicing and reporting processes and metadata about OA funding(Geschuhn & Stone, 2017).While this study advances our knowledge about hybrid OA uptake and invoicing, the limitations leave room for future research. We focused on only one publisher, which limits the generalizability of our findings because Elsevier's journal portfolio, mix of business models, pricing, and promotion of various options cannot be assumed to be representative of scholarly journal publishing in general. Further, although Elsevier's invoicing data improves transparency, it seems likely that not all actual OA funding bodies are disclosed. For instance, most articles were invoiced to authors, but it remains unclear if the APCs were paid by the authors themselves or through institutional OA funds or research grants. Research into this topic would improve our understanding of OA funding outside of publishing agreements. Moreover, our study demonstrates that comprehensive mapping of the financial flows of OA publishing requires complex, in-depth country-specific analyses. Such studies would ideally draw on various data sources to consider research funders, the consortia landscape, OA policies, and publishing agreements.",
