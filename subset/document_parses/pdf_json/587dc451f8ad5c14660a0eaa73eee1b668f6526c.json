            "text": "Introduction Financial domination involves the payment of cash or gifts from a wish list by a money slave to a money mistress, financial dominatrix, or findomme. Boundaries for findommes working through webcam and video-call services may be more fluid than via text-based modes since the domme engages in more visible displays, and modification of language, voice, and feelings to fulfil the fantasy for a client. We explore the nature of findomme work and its relationship to BDSM to understand how the interaction progresses and how the boundaries, of reasonable and permissible behaviour which affect both incoming and outgoing interactions between people, are maintained. Methods The study was in two stages. The first stage was a survey of online findommes (n = 56) in UK and the USA. For the second stage, we explored the experience of findommes (n = 195) on money-slavery websites and social media feeds using netnography as an observation method with cisgender male, female, and transgender participants. Results Our analysis reveals how findomme interaction progresses from text-based interaction to virtual face-to-face and voice communication. We show financial domination to be on a continuum from being a lifestyle choice in the BDSM community that reaps financial benefits to a purely economic and legitimate form of commercial labour. Although financial domination clearly elicits sexual arousal for clients, the relationship can also be exclusively psychological and focus on the relinquishing of control to a money mistress for a prescribed period. Conclusion The findings also show how personal boundaries are negotiated and enhance understanding of how the microculture of findomming interacts with other microcultures. By demystifying the process of financial domination, we clarify its relationship with other microcultures and add to the growing body of literature that destigmatizes consensual erotic labour. Implications These findings show how online support, in a decriminalised environment, enabled new and 'instadommes' to set and maintain healthy boundaries for enhanced physical and psychological well-being, and the research provides valuable insight into sex work that is safely carried out in online spaces by a large number of participants so adding to the growing body of work on decriminalization.",

Users communicate rapidly and with relative ease across geographical divides. Digital platforms are now an integral part of our lives including work, social, and sexual interactions. In addition to opportunities for exploring sexuality, the potential of digital platforms for mass distribution enables various types of online sex work or 'cybersex' such as webcam sex shows. Sex work of this nature may involve real-time (synchronous) or text-based (asynchronous) communication between workers and clients -who may request a performer to carry out specific tasks (Weiss, 2018) . In such relationships, the digital platform offers opportunities for selfpresentation and manufacturing a desirable social and sexual identity (Zhao et al., 2008) . On digital platforms, people report higher numbers of sexual partners, a higher level of 'outness', friends' support, and stronger connections to 'alternative' communities seeking sex online (Shilo & Mor, 2015) .",

Sex work via such platforms may reduce some of the physical risks of full-contact work for sex workers, reduce third-party management, and limit intervention from the criminal justice system and enable authenticity (Bernstein, 2007; Orchard et al., 2021) . By offering specialist services to specific, or more elite clientele, it has been found that workers may also increase their income (Sanders, 2005a) .",

            "text": "One such specialist service is financial domination which involves or the payment of cash and gifts from a digitally based wish list by a money slave to a money mistress or 'financial dominatrix' or findomme. Its growth parallels that of social media 'influencer' culture and its monetisation by content creators to subscribers means that the use of sexualised fan sites has also become more mainstream. Sites such as OnlyFans which occupies the space between influencer culture and webcamming claims more than 1M content creators and 100 million+ registered users with a claim of $3 million+ paid annually to creators (https:// onlyf ans. com/ about). Findommes offer a niche online service of photos or verbal humiliation for customers which is only just beginning to receive mainstream attention (e.g., Hosie, 2021) . It is often aligned to BDSM, and there may be no other connection between the 'domme' and their customer, or there may be an ongoing relationship that builds. Findomme work has reportedly flourished during the COVID-19 pandemic as sex workers, dominatrices, and their customers migrated to DPs due to social distancing precautions (Weiss, 2021) . Prior to the pandemic, the findings of Campbell et al. (2019) highlighted how legal and policy changes which sought to ban online adult services advertising and sex work-related content within DPs would have direct impact on the safety strategies online sex workers employ and would be detrimental to their safety, so it is within the context of decriminalization, current UK harm reduction strategies (Sanders et al., 2020) , Europe (ALDE, 2019), and progressive policy position of some USA election candidates (see Brents et al., 2021 ) that this study is presented.",

            "text": "In her classic study, Chapkis (1997) suggests that all forms of erotic labour may place psychological demands upon workers, some of which may be excessive. A range of research studies (Scambler & Paoli, 2008; Ward & Day, 2004) focused upon the effects of the suppression or manufacturing of emotions during their work and their effects upon the workers' physical and psychological well-being. Studies of phone-sex workers (Flowers, 1998; Rich & Guidroz, 2000) , for example, suggest that issues of emotional labour and concealed stigma (c.f. Koken, 2012; Koken et al., 2014) were present even where work occurred in an anonymous and disembodied space. Considering the diversity of digital platforms and the opportunities for both 'real-time' and asynchronous interactions, questions regarding emotional labour and the potential for emotional risk are increasingly important considerations for research in light of the opportunities for expansion of webcam services and the wider cybersex industry (Jones, 2020) . Hothschild's (1983) concept of emotional labour encompasses the manufacturing, enhancing, or suppressing of emotions to modify or regulate emotional expression and manage emotions according to the display rules of the work. Using 'surface acting', an individual modifies their behaviours to elicit the desired response in another person, whilst remaining aware of the deception. The process of 'deep acting' involves a deeper level of emotion work where the individual attempts to modify actual feelings to match required displays. Surface acting is arguably negatively associated, but deep acting is positively associated, with affective emotional displays during customer interactions (Grandey, 2000; Scott & Barnes, 2011; Vartabedian, 2017) .",

Emotional labour also encompasses the effort, planning, and control needed to express emotions during interpersonal interactions and considers the regularity, extent, and intensity of interaction, the diversity of emotions utilised and emotional dissonance-a condition that signifies that the emotions articulated are discrepant from the emotions felt (Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993; Morris & Feldman, 1996) .

They offer the opportunity to locate like-minded others and enhance networking and selfexpression. Some subcultures have a purely online existence and are linked to contacts who have the same sexual preferences. One of the earliest of these included virtual roleplay activities in 'second life' which enabled participants to realise fantasies and possibilities that might otherwise not be possible or sanctioned in the 'real' world, but without risking marginalisation or stigmatisation (Salter, 2011) . Sexual subcultures have also been subject to the commercialisation of digital platforms and can enjoy easy and anonymous access to online sex shops that cater to their specific interests (Palanadri & Green, 2000; Jones, 2020) . These include, for example, recreational or 'lifestyle' interests in 'fetish' or bondage, domination/sadomasochism (BDSM) (Breslow, et al., 1985; Breslow, 1986; De Neef et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020; Cascalleira et al., 2021) .

While Morris (2018) described 'rinsing' in incidental sex work in gay male subcultures, the work of findommes is characterised by a strong sense of entitlement; online postings by findommes are identified as offering, in some incidences, a 'service' of verbal humiliation or photos, but reciprocity is in no sense guaranteed.",

Little is known, however, about participant demographics or whether exchanges move beyond text-based interaction to encompass visible and 'real time' (i.e., synchronous) digital platform communications. Findommes' text-based demands for money may reflect an online disinhibition effect due to dissociative anonymity and where a person can separate their online actions from their day-to-day selves and responsibilities by virtue of being anonymous. Suler (2004) suggests that DP work enables the form of 'toxic dis inhibition' that has been shown to characterise findomme postings and which may be due to the ability to draw upon dis-associative imagination and the creation of a persona that is not subject to the rules and demands of the real world. Griffiths (2016) suggests that the world of findommes is tantamount to wallet rape, and that it takes advantage of the addictive nature of the BDSM client/submissive-a suggestion many participants may find offensive. Financial domination is, therefore, a burgeoning area and new ground in which academic research is only beginning to surface (Swallow, 2018) .",

In this form of erotic commercial exchange, activities could be framed as moving beyond a leisure activity and towards a form of sex work. In addition to ready affirmation from likeminded individuals, communication via DPs ensures that findommes can manage self-presentation and participate, with great immediacy, in the use of social control mechanisms. The anonymity or adopted persona inherent in FD text-based interactions could facilitate a hit-and-run attitude towards more toxic behaviour and obviate feelings of responsibility (Suler, 2004) . This has been shown to characterise many findomme linguistic postings regarding the control of 'sub' behaviours (Durkin, 2007) . It remains to be determined whether the form of reward mechanisms that findommes experience during such interactions and whether adoption of a DP pseudonym may offset any feelings of 'emotional dissonance' (Ashforth & Humphrey, 1993) .",

Much of the findomme vernacular identified in that study implied a connection to commercial BDSM identified in other studies (McLintlock, 1993; Cheng, 2013) , but there was no open identification with this marginalised subculture. As in BDSM culture, findomme appellations (itself derived from the term femdomme or female dominatrix) suggest a subversion of the traditional roles of gender power and an image of dominant, sexual female. Conversely, pejorative 'subordinate' titles such as 'money slave' and 'money pig' engender and are thought to reinforce social control via their attributes of emasculation and subservience. Commercial sexual encounters involving BDSM are not confined to cisgender heterosexual encounters (Kolmes et al., 2006; Wright, 2006) as Grov et al. (2015) have shown in their research, based on data gathered from escorts, includes role play (dad/son, dominant/submissive). BDSM dominatrix names are also thought to facilitate boundaries, act as 'erotic capital' (Hakim, 2010) , and facilitate the fantasy of role and power play subversion inherent in this subculture as the erotic construction of power ensues (Langridge & Butt, 2005) . Discourses within the BDSM community have also attempted to focus upon the issues of erotic gender power play (Cascalleira, et al., 2021; Williams, 2012) from its S/M component. A descriptive exploratory investigation by Williams et al. (2016) explored how bondage and discipline, dominance and submission, and sadomasochism act as recreational leisure. It is in the former exchange that findommes may arguably be seeking affiliation with the BDSM community, with the additional benefit of financial reward.",

Many authors have argued that the hallmark feature that distinguishes BDSM activity from abuse and/or psychopathology is the presence of mutual informed consent of all those involved (Bezleh et al., 2012; Dunkley & Brotto, 2020) . Reviewers Dunkley and Brotto (2020) examined literature on consent in BDSM, including discussions on safety precautions, consent violations, North American laws pertaining to BDSM practice, and the role of the BDSM community with respect to education and etiquette surrounding consent.

Data were derived from ethnographic fieldwork with professional dominatrices ('pro-dommes') working in New York City and San Francisco as well as in-depth interviews conducted between September 2007 and April 2008. BDSM workers were not only concerned about safety but professionally invested in it, reinforcing it through an identity politics of hierarchies of erotic labour. The multiple implications of this work for public perception and policy implications could only be brought to light through the ethnographic method. In general, men cite their primary recourse to online sexual media, and communications is to aid sexual arousal (Cooper et al., 2000) . The subtext to findomme activity is therefore suggested to be one of either psychological or sexual arousal for the money slaves through a findomme's demands. Conversely, findommes' motivations are identified as financial, and the research offers evidence for them using social control mechanisms via digital platforms to extract money. Early studies of striptease artists (Deshotels & Forsyth, 2006; Wood, 2000) suggest, however, that it is the power over men, the 'rush' or thrill of the pursuit, and the ability to manipulate clients for money that are enjoyable and sometimes addictive factors for some female workers in this sector.",

Given what is known about stigma and its effect on working conditions (Benoit et al., 2017a, b) , the punitive approach and effect on sex workers (Benoit et al., 2018) and its role in strategies and challenges sex workers face (Bungay & Guta, 2018) , are highly relevant to sex relations and the work of findommes on digital platforms. How sex workers manage enacted or felt that stigma may impose upon both their psychological and mental health (Garcia & Crocker, 2008; Sanders, 2005a Sanders, , 2008 Van Wesenbeek, 2005) . The stigma associated with sex work has been shown to ostracise workers, impair their human rights, and ability to access legal, health, and psychological support mechanisms (Brooks-Gordon, 2006; Scambler & Paoli, 2008; Ward & Day, 2004; Jiaou & Bungay, 2019) . Stigma has also been shown to impair the ability to regulate and control one's actions (Inzlicht et al., 2006) . Many individuals, however, develop strategies to fight stigma rather than internalising feelings of shame (Parker & Aggelton, 2003; Koken, 2012; Koken et al, 2014) . Whilst the existing literature focuses upon the fear of disclosure and shame of emasculation felt by straight male subs in paying for submissive activities, research attests, however, to the censorial attitudes meted out towards both sex workers and clients and which may subject them to ostracism within the wider community (Brooks-Gordon, 2006; O'Connell & Layder, 1994; Ward & Day, 2004) . It is in the violation of cultural ideals regarding the exchange of intimacy for remuneration where all participants in financial domination might expect to experience difficulty in disclosing their activities outside of subcultural digital platform communities and trusted relationships.",

This determines that individuals with nonmainstream proclivities are able to exchange information, gain support, and rationalise their abrogation of socially accepted norms of sexual interaction. This may in turn serve to maintain their participation considering other negative reactions and promote in-group solidarity, and this has also been seen amongst cisgender and trans sex workers : Orchard et al., 2021 . The use of various different digital platforms may require management to reduce client pressure and unwanted interaction and could be expected to shape behaviours of both findommes and their subordinates. Understanding the range of DP activities that financial domination encompasses is therefore central to understanding boundary maintenance and the potential for emotional and erotic labour that is inherent in all sex work (Chapkis, 1997; Sanders, 2004; Abel, 2011) .",

Where activities are expected to move beyond the asynchronous nature of text and involve corporeal display through webcam smartphone communication, it may be reasonable to anticipate some degree of script and negotiation on the part of clients and findommes and which frequently forms the basis of face-to-face sex work (Sanders, 2005b) . Separating one's visible online persona from one's 'vanilla' (non-FD) life may therefore require recognized strategies such as rituals of makeup and clothing to assume a 'work role'. Earlier ethnographic studies of phonesex workers (Flowers, 1998) highlighted the need for boundary maintenance and reduction of emotional dissonance even within a disembodied and anonymous environment. Humour and the operators' ability to manufacture an identity are emotion strategies in both FTF sex and phone-sex interactions (Flowers, 1998; Sanders, 2004) . This indicates an effort to establish and maintain a distinct boundary between workers' public and private roles and to emotionally distance them from their client (Brewis & Linstead, 2000a, b) .",

In addition to voice divergence, phone-sex workers, like face-toface sex workers, may construct a persona and utilise highly scripted conversations linked to customers' fantasies and expectations (Flowers, 1998; Rich & Guidroz, 2000) . This obviates the need to infringe the personal moral code of the real self, protect personal boundaries, and may reduce sex work stigma. Phone-sex workers were shown however shown to experience pressure to change the boundaries of their sexuality and to manufacture emotions and behaviours in line with client fantasy. Determining whether FD activities limits itself to text-based activities is therefore an important consideration, since employment of webcam activity may frame it within the domain of a 'live' sex act and where erotic labour and the management of emotions in the course of work are thought to be implicit features (Abel, 2011; Chapkis, 1997; Jones, 2020; Sanders, 2005b) .",

Based upon the gaps in the existing literature, this research aims to clarify how findommes dictate and maintain their physical and psychological limits of interaction on digitally based platforms. This includes establishing how the findommes adopt strategies to manage emotional labour, avoid or handle stigma, and maintain their psychological health. This research follows the work of Chapkis (1997) ; Flowers (1998) ; Williams (2012) and Lindmann (2013) and takes the work of Williams et al. (2016) and (Campbell et al., 2019) as a starting point to examine contemporary erotic DP and, in particular, the microculture findommes and their perceptions and behaviour. A specific aim of the research is to establish some personal demographics as to who might be assuming this role, the range of activities engaged with, and findommes' motivations. Further aims are to establish how findommes engage and maintain the physical and psychological limits of their activities, and whether they manage and use their emotions during interactions.",

As the policies of some police forces, and political parties, increasingly progress towards harm reduction (Brooks-Gordon et al., 2017; Brents & Sanders, 2010; Sanders et al., 2020) , it is important to understand the world of findommes in more detail. This will help answer wider questions raised by the literature, for example, whether findomming is more likely to attract those already part of the BDSM community and are attracted to the work, or whether those already in sex work transferring to the area of domination which is known to be a more highly paid area (see Brooks-Gordon et al., 2015) .

An online survey was used to gather categorical data on personal demographics of geographic location, age, gender, sexual orientation, relationship, and employment status-population which is sparse in the literature on findommes. In addition, several open-ended questions were asked about respondents' motivations for participation in money slavery, and positive or negative aspects to their work. The phrasing of questions recognised the need to minimise bias, social desirability, leading questions and value judgements. The survey was limited to findommes and advertised on a range of social media sites. This method enabled voluntary participation, and a pilot survey ran for a period of 2 weeks, and minor adjustments were made in phrasing to ensure greater clarification and speed of response. The demographic data was gathered using the survey builder on SurveyMonkey\u00a9. The open-ended responses were analysed qualitatively.",

Participants' realities were explored in terms of the microand macroenvironment, their public versus their private lives, and findommes' collective and individual experiences. This approach increased ecological validity by allowing for the triangulation and 'linking' of data with which to generate theory. The research was initiated via passive observation and the gathering of field notes from seven money-slavery websites and Twitter feeds. Using an approach inspired by grounded theory (Glaser & Strauss, 1967) , the data was axial coded, and then, a content analysis approach was employed to the setting up of a money-slavery blog and Facebook page. This was achieved by posing a series of open-ended questions on the themes relating to findomme activity including the management and setting of personal boundaries, feelings regarding the disclosure of activities, and the management of emotions during the course of their work and enabling participants to offer their written responses to the blog and Face book page voluntarily. Participants chose to either remain anonymous or employ a pseudonym. Enabling anonymity of participants reduced the need for self-presentation by the participant and response to the structure of power between the researcher and the participant. Whilst acknowledging the issues of self-presentation that are inherent in social media, author A became a participant/observer on Facebook to allow for both asynchronous and real-time synchronous interactions with findommes and also observations of findomme/money-slave interactions. The survey page, blog, Twitter, and Facebook sites were hyperlinked to each other in order to enable dissemination of information and maximise voluntary participation at a national and international level.

In adopting a policy of informed consent, we did not engage in researching participants who declared themselves to have mental health difficulties or communicate with them whilst they stated themselves to be under the influence of alcohol/prohibited substances. Where this was later revealed by two participants, we employed a policy of 'self-censorship' (Lee, 1999) and removed their contributions in order to respect this additional vulnerability.

Questions were screened to reduce any discriminatory biases around race, disability, or sexuality and minimise potential feelings of jeopardy or stigma (Lee, 1999) . Participants read the research declaration before progressing to sign a permission form declaring they were over 18 years of age and their consent to take part in the survey. Participants chose their pseudonym at this point. The survey permitted participants to opt out of any questions they did not feel comfortable answering. Access to survey responses was limited to the researcher via a code name and password. As a pseudonym may contain elements of a subject's real name (Roberts et al., 2004) , all printed data and field notes, were recoded and then locked in the researcher's filing cabinet. Stored computer information was protected by a subsequent password and security system because ethnographers need to be able to respond to the multiplicity of digital platform methods available, whilst applying standardised principles of protection for their participants in a digital environment that has diverged from the face-to-face research for which guiding ethical principles were designed (Cora Garcia et al., 2009 ). Critical to our concern was the opportunity for demarginalising the voice of stigmatised communities (Murthy, 2008) and with self-reflection comes the need to be aware of the embedded hierarchical position of the researcher. The stigma to which female sex workers are subjected means that it is important to adopt data collection methods that are non-exploitative, giving respondents control, and which permitted us to 'enter the common sense world' of those being studied and document it. All questions were designed to reduce the probability of distress to participants, and we also employed the voluntary service of a personal counsellor in the event of participants recounting any distress.",

Active digital platform ethnography of sexual subcultures can result in exposure to unwanted imagery, unwitting social consolidation of participant behaviours, and the need to provide psychological support outside of the research brief. Careful consideration and planning for these are risk management factors in active cyber ethnography, and successfully negotiated mean research can benefit from participant observation rather than mere observation. As a non-participant in FD, researcher A acknowledged her position as a mature, heterosexual cisgender female, her role as a 'na\u00efve' researcher and lack of first-hand knowledge regarding FD, and sex work on digital platforms. In considering these factors and the need to overcome the potential for power imbalance between the researcher and participants, researcher A worked under a pseudonym but was transparent about these factors of her identity in order to encourage a more reciprocal experience. Additionally, she maintained detailed study notes that enabled reflection and monitoring of one's own interactions and observations for any preconceived ideas, biases, and enacted stigma regarding digital platform sex work, FD, and the BDSM community.",

Table 1 shows the number of responses (n) in each category and its percentage calculation corrected to one decimal place. Table 1 The data in Table 1 (a) shows that participants were predominantly from the United Kingdom (n = 33) and the USA (n = 13) and that participation in FD took place in Europe, Australia, and Asia (n = 7). Participants' declared gender status is illustrated in (b) and most participants identified as cisgender female (n = 35) or male (n = 18) with only one transgender respondent (n = 1). Our survey findings (c) indicate that most participants were between 18 to 28 years of age and that activity continues for findommes into their fifties. Most of our respondents were heterosexual (n = 42), but Table 1 (d) shows several participants were bisexual (n = 10) or gay/lesbian (n = 2). In terms of relationship status (e), 40% of participants were single, whilst 33% of participants declared themselves to be either married or cohabiting. The majority of participants (n = 41) had no dependants under 16 years of age, but approximately 24% had them which can be seen Table 1 (f). Approximately 46% of findommes were in full-time employment and a further 54% (n = 29) in either part-time work or studying full or part time as students whilst the remainder (13%) were unemployed, as seen in Table 1 (g). For the majority, FD offered an income to fund a specific chosen lifestyle in Table 1 (h); interestingly, many respondents (n = 28) chose not to disclose their reasons for participation in FD, whilst for others, it was the payment of university or college fees and loans, or financial hardship that was the primary motivation. To the open response question, twenty cisgender female respondents cited attention, personal power, work flexibility, money, and gifts as positive aspects of the work, and some participants indicated that they felt 'addicted' to the 'buzz' of receiving such items through the post. The findommes declaring their range of DP activities in Table 1 (f) were exclusively female (n = 45) and were actively engaged in a range of digital platform-related activities paid for by their money slaves. Most respondents used flirtatious and erotic language and also included 'dressing up' in desired costume as part of their work. The data gathered in Table 1 (i) also shows most participants (n = 56) use some form of DP messaging and corporeal display via webcam as part of their repertoire. Some of these (n = 23) were considering a progression to meeting clients on a 1:1 basis or taking part in a physical or 'real-time' domination session. One participant indicated, however, that money slavery might also include 'just talking' to a client. There was no indication to suggest that any findomme activities, even on a 1:1 real-time basis, included sexual intercourse. Some findommes indicated feelings of stigma at being associated with sex work and the verbal abuse meted out by clients. All participants cited negative feelings when men tried to obtain free services.",

The breadth of respondents' geographical participation supports the literature showing that the internet as a social consolidation mechanism that collapsing geographical divides that enables communication with others of similar interests and to gain support (Durkin & Bryant, 1995) . Most participants had no dependants under 16 years of age, but for the quarter of participants who did participation in FD may therefore present a rational choice for the payment of childrearing costs. This also may place an additional burden on some participants to hide their activities. More than half the participants were either in part-time work, a studying, or unemployed, and for these, financial domination also represents a rational choice as a means to earn what can amount to a substantial amount of money from the privacy of their home, whilst meeting the demands of college or university fees, caring responsibilities, or reduced educational opportunities. The ability to work from home and earn a comparatively high income may represent, however, a rational choice for the participants who declared their motivation to be financial hardship or to pay tuition fees. Research has indicated increasing acceptance of sex work by students as a means of coping with financial difficulties (Roberts et al., 2004) . The participation of overseas and UK students in this research may also reflect the evidence gathered for worker rationalisation of sexual commerce as a means of paying for tuition fees, rather than accruing substantial debt, and of the mainstreaming of the sex industry (Brents & Sanders, 2010) .",

Although FD clearly elicits sexual arousal for clients, the relationship can also be exclusively psychological and focus on the relinquishing of control to a money mistress for a prescribed period before returning to 'normal' activities and relationships. Female dominant/female slave relationships may see the subordinate seeking a dominant cis gender female superior as a form of mentor or authoritative 'mother' figure. Those participants were using online messaging, and corporeal display via webcam extends the existing research literature (Durkin, 2007) and suggests that, for some participants, FD activity could be framed as a form of visible DP sex work and where both participants may be visible rather than anonymous.

            "text": "Findommes' motivation appears to be the subject of much debate even within its own community websites, and whilst FD involves commercial exchange, it also represents a lifestyle and offers opportunities for experimentation and role play as a 'dominant'. Some findommes identify with the BDSM ideology of an erotic power exchange and distinguish their activities as being highly skilled virtual fetish work, which may, in turn, lead to face-to-face domination of clients. For these participants, it was the matching of the findomme motivation of payment with client desire for submission that underpinned the success of the relationship, rather than the actual amount of money being transferred. This research offered empirical evidence that attention, the ability to control others, and feelings of self-empowerment are also important motivations and may also represent reasons for prolonged findomme activity. For many findommes, however, like other forms of sex-work, it is strictly entrepreneurial (Sanders, 2005a) and represents the ability to use erotic capital (Hakim, 2010) to supplement income by catering to a very specific population of predominantly cis gender male clients who seek non-conventional relationships that cannot be fulfilled by partners. On the open response question, twenty female respondents cited attention, personal power, work-flexibility, money, and gifts as positive aspects of the work, and some participants indicated that they felt 'addicted' to the 'buzz' of receiving such items through the post. These findings add to the existing literature on FD motivation and suggest that attention and power may be supplementary factors to FD motivation. Whilst commercially driven, the boundaries between financial dominations being a lifestyle activity and sex work were not explicit and were negotiated in a variety of ways. The research literature (Deshotel & Forsyth, 2006) identified that power, feelings of enhanced desirability, and manipulation in the pursuit of money were important for findommes. The component of emotional risk for those entering the work for purely financial reasons and who, as research has identified, may be poorly prepared for its psychological demands (Ray, 2007) .",

In such cases, the apparent anonymity of the findomme persona may seem to be an attractive option since it may signify the opportunity to gain commercial goods and money for a minimum of sexual interaction and which can be more readily compartmentalised from other day-to-day activities. In both direct and non-direct communications, findommes were observed and reported to be in active negotiation in what Bernstein (2007) refers to as the 'bounded authenticity' of an authentic yet bounded interpersonal connection in terms of the physical and emotional content of their services. The commercialisation and negotiation of activity indicate that the titles of dominatrix and 'slave' may sometimes be a misnomer, which reflects some of the dynamics identified in commercial BDSM relationships (Williams, 2012) . The dominants declaring their range of DP activities were exclusively female and were actively engaged in a range of digitally based activities paid for by their money slaves. Most respondents used flirtatious and erotic language and included 'dressing up' in desired costume as part of their work. This may indicate the adoption of a work 'persona' (Sanders, 2005b) and emotional labour to separate work and personal lives and meet client demand.",

As in direct contact sex work, findommes may refuse activities they feel are distasteful, but fiscal considerations may in some cases exert considerable influence in the willingness to fulfil clients' desires and maintain their loyalties (Sanders, 2005b) . Wilson (2005) advises that, even with the commercial BDSM community and the suggested dominant/slave relationship, workers may have intense negotiations with clients regarding the scripting of role play. By identifying with and observing the unwritten rules of not poaching other findommes' money slaves, participants were able to utilise in-group solidarity to both monitor and control unwanted aggressive 'out-group' behaviours whilst enacting their own specific identity and gain acceptance and respect.

In this research, there was evidence for example, of younger, less experienced findommes being pressurised to extend boundaries of text-only interaction, to include web-based work involving full frontal nudity. Findommes' agency increased where they asserted their lack of financial dependency and their entitlement to it as dominant females. Assertions of financial independence also acted as a form of erotic capital enhancing personal status and earning potential (Hakim, 2010) . Even within the context of text-based interactions, clients' behaviours appeared to follow traditional scripts of sex work (Sanders, 2008) and a desire to move towards an established and defined relationship with their findomme. Maintaining the boundaries of an agreed relationship and reinforcing clients' awareness of fantasy/real life often required considerable emotion work for findommes. Findommes, in general, may elicit very high levels of emotional stress and verbal aggression from clients who experience difficulty in reconciling the fantasy of their expectations with their real lives and the limitations of the DP relationship. In this sense, operating within the digitally based world does not necessarily safeguard findommes from client's preexisting relationship scripts, their desire to re-enact them, and the psychological demands of negotiating them.",

This research lends support to the findings of Durkin (2007) in establishing that findommes make extensive use of social control mechanisms to model and reinforce the etiquette of interaction and exchange with 'subordinates. Social learning theory (Akers, 1985) was also found to be an applicable model for explaining some behaviours in that both findommes and money-slaves' behaviours receive mutual reinforcement. For money slaves, offering money elicits praise, psychological and sexual relief. In addition to receiving the adoration and attention from money slaves, findommes were able to draw upon extensive support and affirmation when carrying out punitive sanctions such as blackmail, humiliation, and verbal aggression on clients during their web page postings. This also includes support from other findommes and other 'subordinates' seeking to model and seek affirmation for their own adherence to desired 'sub ' behaviours. The survey findings lend support for social learning theories (Thomas et al., 2010) and differential reinforcement whereby behaviours are strengthened and may persist through reward mechanisms of significant others and where positive and neutralising definitions of actions may serve to offset negative ones (Akers et al., 1997; Abel, 2011) .",

Such comparison leads us to explore the policy implications of such findings, which point to decriminalisation. Workers in any part of the economy deserve autonomy, labour, and wider human rights (such as freedom of association), and the findings also demonstrate how online findommes, in their interaction with each other, create an online community. Ergo, this study illustrates how autonomy and safety are achieved by online findommes and so adds to the growing body of literature on decriminalisation.",

In line with research literature (Ray, 2007) , the felt stigma is appeared to be associated with the participant's own personal attitudes towards sex/fetish work, and hasty entry based upon financial necessity. Several responses indicated that feelings of stigma may persist long after financial domination activity has discontinued and even where activities were not disclosed or visible to others. It thereby reflecting much of the wider discourse on sex work (Brooks-Gordon, 2006) and how wider censure, rather than the work itself, may cause psychological difficulty and social exclusion (Ward & Day, 2004) . Participants were, however, able to draw upon the 'felt anonymity' (Akdenis, 2002) of DP communities to ease concern with public stigmatization and to encourage communal rationalization. The issue of stigma that underpins much of the discourse on direct sex work (Scambler, 2008; Koken, 2012) was also shown to be an important factor in financial domination. Where findommes were unable to share or disclose their interests and activities with peers, associates, and family members, then 'felt stigma' was experienced as participants indicated that they were concerned at not being able to account for their earnings or gaps in employment history filled by FD activity when seeking more traditional forms of employment. The general stigma of involvement in sex work persisted long after FD activity had ceased, and some participants feared disclosure. Many respondents also experienced enacted stigma and censure from friends and the general public. Stigma in this sense was due to association with prostitution and participants deeming to be legitimate targets for vilification. Findommes were also perceived to be violating accepted codes of behaviour by seeking money and gifts for humiliation and subordinating predominantly male clients. In what is a reversal of the female 'victim'/ male 'user' dynamic that pervades FTF female sex work, findommes were deemed to be exploiting male inadequacies and insecurities for personal gain. In this sense, findommes were exposed to the general stigmatisation surrounding sex work, whilst being reproached for not offering an authentic exchange for their work. By identifying work as fetish or as therapeutic in nature, some respondents legitimised their activities and managed this enacted stigmatisation.",

Future considerations for research also include the progression from financial domination into 'real-time' commercial domination activities. The possibility of fraud remains as Durkin (2007) astutely observes an important area for consideration. With easy access to DPs and the lure of 'risk-free' money, a priority for findomme research should be to determine the potential for exploitation.
