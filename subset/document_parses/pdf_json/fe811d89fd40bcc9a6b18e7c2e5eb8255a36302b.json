Once diagnosed, numerous treatment options exist. Surgery is the treatment of choice for non-advanced breast cancer; chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and hormone therapy are adjuvant treatments with consolidated benefit in diminishing the risk of relapse and improving long-term survival [9] . Breast cancer treatments prompt changes in a person's physical appearance, sexuality, and fertility that interfere with their identity, attractiveness, self-esteem, social relationships, and sexual functioning [10] . Patients also report more fatigue and sleep disturbances [11] . Treatment side effects, together with prognostic uncertainty cause the woman to suffer negative experiences, such as stress in significant relationships, and emotions, like anxiety, sadness, guilt, and/ or fear of death with negative consequences on breast cancer patients' quality-of-life [10, 12] . Once treatment is completed, patients need time to recover their activity, as they report decreased bodily and mental function [13] , fear of relapse [14] , and changes in employment status [15] . After a time, there is a risk of recurrence influenced by prognostic factors, such as nodal involvement, size, histological grade, hormone receptor status, and treatment of the primary tumor [16] . Thirty percent (30%) of patients with early breast cancer eventually go on to develop metastases [17] . There is currently no curative treatment for patients with metastatic breast cancer; consequently, the main objectives are to prolong survival, enhance or maintain quality-of-life, and control symptoms [17, 18] . In metastatic stages, women and their families are not only living with uncertainty about the future, the threat of death, and burden of treatment, but also dealing with the existential, social, emotional, and psychological difficulties their situation entails [18, 19] .",

Patient-centered care is an essential component of quality care that seeks to improve responsiveness to patients' needs, values, and predilections and to enhance psychosocial outcomes, such as anxiety, depression, unmet support needs, and quality of life [29] . Qualitative studies are becoming more and more germane to grasp specific aspects of breast cancer, such as communication [27, 30] , body image and sexuality [31, 32] , motherhood [33] , social support [34] , survivors' reintegration into daily life [13, 15] , or care for women with incurable, progressive cancer [17] . Nevertheless, few published studies address the experience of women with breast cancer from diagnosis to follow-up. These include a clinical pathway approach in the United Kingdom in the early 21st century [35] , a breast cancer patient journey in Singapore [25] , a netnography of breast cancer patients in a French specialized forum [28] , a meta-synthesis of Australian women living with breast cancer [36] , and a systematic review blending qualitative studies of the narratives of breast cancer patients from 30 countries [37] . Sanson-Fisher et al. [29] concluded that previously published studies had examined limited segments of patients' experiences of cancer care and emphasized the importance of focusing more on their experiences across multiple components and throughout the continuum of care. Therefore, the aim of this study is to depict the experiences of Spanish breast cancer patients in their journey through all stages of the disease. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies that examine the experience of women with breast cancer in Spain from diagnosis through treatment to follow-up of survivors and those who suffer a relapse or incurable disease presented as a journey map.",

Earlier studies state that experiencing cancer is highly stressful. It involves a major threat to life or physical integrity, in addition to mental health, interfering with the path, projects, and plans patients have for their life over the short, medium, and, on occasion, long term as well [6] . Along with reporting adverse physical and psychological impacts, patients also report positive ways in which they have grown psychologically or emotionally from the experience [7, 42] . The diagnosis of breast cancer not only impacts the women individually, but also affects their surroundings. As reported in the literature, despite going through a very challenging time, the women struggle to put on a positive face and attempt to conserve the family's well-being, specifically that of their children [7] . At the same time, the family is a fundamental source of support and usually provide indispensable support; however, it is not always effective, because family members do not fully understand the stresses involved in living with cancer [43] . Previous studies also reveal that for some women, their partners are one of their most significant supports; nonetheless, research also suggests that a cancer diagnosis predicts marital breakup more strongly for female survivors than males [44] . Our results reflect that the women frequently resort to other women in the same situation, possibly because they face significant unmet supportive care needs [30] . The need for social support may lead patients to seek social support groups consisting of people who are experiencing similar health crises, because such groups allow them to interact with those who best understand their suffering [43] . Another aspect that appears across the board is the relationship the participants have with the medical team. In this study, we have noted their trust in the medical team and acceptance of the treatments proposed without going into the clinical data of the disease and without needing to know the benefit provided by the treatment. Cancer patients are confronted with a potentially life-threatening [condition], feeling vulnerable, and need to rely heavily on their care providers, expecting the physician to act in their best interests [5] . Therefore, they need to have a close relationship, as well as comprehensive care [30] . Patients' trust in a physician has been associated with a reduction of their fears and anxiety and [increased] satisfaction and adherence to treatment [5, 30] . We believe that it would be important to provide patients with accurate information, so as to avoid misunderstandings (such as cancer being synonymous with death, regardless of stage) as several participants in this study have reported, which can lead them to believe that the risk of relapse with and without chemotherapy is much greater than the oncologists estimate [45] . We believe that in future studies that it would be worthwhile to examine the peculiarities of each kind of patient information with the aim of determining how to break it up and make it both comprehensible and tolerable to promote patients' well-being.",

The literature has reported that many women experience peritraumatic distress or dissociation during the medical conversation in which they are given their diagnosis of cancer [48] , which might account for the reactions of the respondents. Given that, when they receive their diagnosis, additional information is generally given to them, such as clinical aspects and preferred treatments. Repeating this information at subsequent appointments could contribute to improving communication with patient, since several participants stated that they found it hard to pay attention to the physician, given the emotional impact. Additionally, breast cancer patients tend to be diagnosed when they are relatively young, and often when they are in the middle furthering their career or raising children [12] . In spite of everything, the women try to put on as brave a face as they can and focus on maintaining their children's well-being [7] . Telling children about their diagnosis is reportedly one of the biggest challenges; parents are usually unsure of how to tell them, because at the same time that they want it to be open and honest and cover their children's developmental needs, they also want to protect them children [49] .",

The most salient experiences of these phases pertain to the impact of side effects on physical quality-of-life and psychological well-being, which is consistent with the literature [11] . Moreover, cancer therapy entails physical changes that affect their feminine identity, fertility, self-esteem, sexual functioning, and makes them more vulnerable [10, 50] . Women described their inner self as being on an emotional rollercoaster with highs and lows throughout the various phases of treatment [7] . Given treatment side effects and sequelae, these women are more likely to experience physical symptoms and psychological disorders than patients with other kinds of tumors [51] . The side effects involve an acute sense of loss of health and quality-of-life, as well as identity and femininity. It would be interesting for future research to explore the therapies used in grief counseling with cancer patients, as understanding and exploring this perspective could comprise an additional clinical aid.",

However, in line with our results, the literature reveals that even though they want to normalize their lives, female breast cancer survivors feel that they will never return to their baseline status [7] . A significant number of patients experience difficulties in physical, cognitive, and emotional functioning after their treatment, such as symptoms like lymphedema, fatigue, pain, sleep disorders, cancer-related cognitive impairment, emotional stress, symptoms of depression and anxiety, problems with relationships, reduced sexual identity, fertility problems, and fear of cancer relapse [13, 14] . Furthermore, patients with hormone therapy suffer hot flashes, sweats, joint pain, weight gain, decreased libido, and low energy [52] . A sizeable number of these women also experience changes in employment status which can happen even 5-10 years following diagnosis [15] . Given that all these changes alter the structure of the woman's everyday life, personalized care and treatment plans in cancer survivors are highlighted in the literature with extended specialized support being proposed that enables them to make a better psychosocially adjusted transition from treatment to follow-up [53] and advocating for the patient's participation in all decisions that affect her during this period [54] . Further research is needed concerning how to structure the follow-up and support offered to these women during this stage so as to meet their needs and help them adjust to their new reality with the chronic sequelae caused by cancer and its treatment. On the other hand, the personal transformation of the initial stages of the journey are best seen during this phase. The literature shows that women who have had breast cancer report changes in their philosophy of life, such as embarking on a new life path, changing their priorities in life, as well as valuing life in general [42] . Most of the participants in our study place special emphasis on appreciating life, enjoying it more, and living each day to the fullest. Cancer survivors report being aware of how precarious life is, while also feeling the joy of being alive [55] . Similarly, they have been found to be more resilient and better able to repair their mood than healthy women [56] .",

Metastatic breast cancer is uncurable, which is why these women's main psychosocial challenges are not the same as those who are diagnosed in early stages [18] . Faced with incurability, the women react with shock and fear of imminent death, but this anxiety diminishes once they begin treatment and learn that there are more treatment options [17] . During this phase, the interviewees reported impaired physical QoL and functioning, being hindered by pain, fatigue, or menopausal symptoms. Emotionally, they report suffering bouts of depression and anxiety, as well as fear because of the spread of their cancer. As for their relational QoL, their children's welfare is their number one concern, especially for mothers of young children [17, 57] . What's more, these women felt isolated from society in general and, more specifically, from the nonadvanced breast cancer community, inasmuch as they feel that nobody understands what they are going through [18] . A psychosocial approach is especially important in this phase to help these women to continuously adapt to the changes of their individual clinical situation and to the progression of the disease, thereby improving their coping.",

Moreover, the findings do not reflect men's experiences with breast cancer and research with this group would enrich the field further.

(Patient 1)Many patients say that chemotherapy decreases their libido and dries up their mucous membranes, which is why they prefer not to have sex. For those who live as a couple, this situation can strain the relationship.Sexually, I just didn't feel like it, I wasn't in the mood; not only did I not feel like it, my mucous membranes were dry and, what's smore, I just couldn't, I couldn't, I felt bad for my husband, but he said, \"Don't worry.\" (Patient 16)Finally, some interviewees expressed a feeling of being poisoned by the treatment. These women tend to be highly focused on taking care of their body and have a very natural attitude toward life.I had to really work my awareness that I was poisoning myself; at night I was at home and I thought that all that red liquid was circulating through my veins . . .
