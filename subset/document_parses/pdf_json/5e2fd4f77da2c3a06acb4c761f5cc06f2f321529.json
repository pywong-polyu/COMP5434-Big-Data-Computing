Methods Diagnoses of COVID-19 were based on positive results from real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction testing of nasopharyngeal-swab specimens. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients showing positive results. The clinical characteristics and results of blood tests were compared between the patients with and without pneumonia. The risk factors associated with pneumonia were then evaluated by a multivariable analysis. Results The study cohort comprised 154 patients, including 117 patients (76.0%) with pneumonia at first visit. Significant differences were seen in age, the frequency of fever, tachycardia, desaturation (peripheral oxygen saturation ! 95%), any comorbidity, neutrocyte count and fraction, lymphocyte count and fraction, platelet count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen between the patients with and without pneumonia. Using a multivariable analysis, CRP \" 0.3 mg/dL and fibrinogen >400 mg/dL were found to be associated with the presence of pneumonia. Conclusion Community-based settings for screening COVID-19 patients should perform chest X-ray and blood tests for white blood cell fractions, fibrinogen, LDH, and CRP. Of these, elevations in the CRP and fibrinogen levels could be critically associated with the presence of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

            "text": "Since the first case of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019, the virus has spread worldwide. The World Health Organization declared a pandemic on March 4, 2020. In Japan, the first case of COVID-19 was confirmed on January 15, 2020, based on the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare (MHLW) announcement. As of June 3, 2020, a total of 16,986 cases of COVID-19 had been diagnosed under the State of Emergency covering all 47 prefectures in Japan, with 1,308 patients being hospitalized (1) . As COVID-19 can lead acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) at rates of 15-31% with an onset time of around 8-12 days (2), making a timely and accurate diagnosis while determining the individual risk of developing ARDS is important. In primary settings, the establishment of clinical and laboratory factors predicting and distinguishing asymptomatic patients, particularly those about to develop pneumonia would be useful. We have diagnosed 154 patients with COVID-19 at Tokyo Shinagawa Hospital, a community hospital located in the southern area of Tokyo, covering over 1,100,000 residents. The patients included were both those attending outpatient clinics with symptoms and asymptomatic subjects mainly identified due to close contact with already identified COVID-19 patients. This report could offer the first \"realworld\" data of COVID-19 patients from a community-based institution, and thus would support the general clinical practice and decision-making for potential COVID-19 patients in Japan. In the future, COVID-19 seems likely to be a major community-acquired pneumonia occurring throughout all seasons, so the analysis and classification of the patient characteristics at the time of initial diagnosis should prove valuable. Our findings provide information on the real features of COVID-19 patients diagnosed in a community hospital.",

A blood sample and chest X-ray were obtained from each patient, and additional computed tomography (CT) was performed when abnormal findings were identified on X-rays. Medical records, chest X-ray and CT images were reviewed for the clinical findings. Epidemiological, demographic, clinical and laboratory data were extracted from electronic medical records. The normal ranges of laboratory data were based on institutional standards. Two researchers (MS and TS) independently reviewed the data collection forms to double-check the collected data.",

Rather, leukocytosis is thought to suggest the presence of a bacterial infection, superinfection (14, 15) , acute exacerbation of interstitial pneumonitis (16) or another viral pneumonia such as by influenza virus (17) , all of which need to be differentiated from COVID-19 pneumonia.",

A recent report mentioned that the plasma CRP level correlated positively with the severity of COVID-19 pneumonia (18) . In our study, an elevated CRP level at the initial examination was useful for detecting pneumonia. The plasma levels of fibrinogen are known to be elevated in inflammatory diseases (19, 20) . COVID-19 has also been reported to induce coagulopathy with prominent elevations of D-dimer and fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products (8, (21) (22) (23) . Previous reports mentioned the utility of fibrinogen or D-dimer as factors associated with an aggravated severity of disease. This study revealed a significant increase in fibrinogen at the first visit. An elevated fibrinogen concentration at the first visit might offer a useful predictor of the presence of pneumonia in the early phase of COVID-19.",

When these findings are seen, chest CT is recommended. Surprisingly, 76.0% of the patients already had pneumonia on presentation, 10% of whom did not have a fever and presented to the hospital mostly because they had been in close contact with a known COVID-19 patient. Considering that some patients are asymptomatic, blood testing is warranted for screening. Taken together with these findings, COVID-19 pneumonia could be detected in community-based primary settings by not only chest X-rays, but also blood testing, including WBC fractions and the concentrations of fibrinogen, LDH, and CRP.",
