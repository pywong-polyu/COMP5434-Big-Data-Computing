Data were analysed to describe the clinicodemographic profile and viral load in neonates born to COVID 19 positive mothers. Of 2947 deliveries, 69 mothers were COVID 19 positive (2.3%), with 1 abortion, 2 macerated stillbirths and 2 fresh stillbirths as pregnancy outcomes. Of 65 tested neonates, 10.7% (7) were confirmed COVID 19 positive by RTPCR (reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction). Viral load (cycle threshold, Ct of E, RDRp) in neonates was comparable with the Ct reported from adults; however, neonates had milder clinical manifestations. All 7 neonates who tested positive for COVID 19 were subsequently discharged. Six of the 7 neonates were asymptomatic and 1 neonate needed respiratory support (indication being prematurity) which resolved after 48 h. Maternal and neonatal comparison of Ct of E and RdRp gene was statistically non-significant (25.97 vs 19.68, p = 0.34 and 26.5 vs 25.0, p = 0.84). Viral loads of mothers with COVID 19 positive neonates compared with mothers with COVID 19 negative neonates for E and RdRp gene were also statistically non-significant (25 vs 27.19, p = 0.63 and 19.6 vs 27.6, p = 0.08). The majority (93%) of neonates tested later than 48 h (roomed in with mother and breastfed) tested negative.",

In February 2020, the World Health Organisation (WHO) designated the disease COVID 19, which stands for coronavirus disease 2019. To date, India has reported 366,946 confirmed cases of COVID 19 infection [1] . Pregnant women are a vulnerable group of the population susceptible to the COVID 19 infection due to physiological changes in the immunological and circulatory parameters. As a result, neonates born to COVID 19 positive mothers are at risk of infection as well as adverse outcomes due to the infection. Little is known about perinatal and neonatal COVID 19 infection until now, with current evidence-based predominantly on case series and case reports. One of the first and largest case series is on 33 neonates born to COVID 19 confirmed mothers [2] . Multiple routes of transmission apart from post-partum transmission (horizontal) have been postulated including trans placental in utero, the immediate peripartum period through fetoplacental bleed or amniotic fluid and breast milk .",

Ellington et al described that amongst women with COVID 19, approximately one-third of pregnant women were hospitalised compared with 5.8% of non-pregnant women [13] . Similarly, higher risk of decompensation and complications were reported in the latter half of pregnancy by Badr et al. [14] Most recently, reports with evidence of vertical transmission have been published [28, 29] . Vivanti et al demonstrated the transplacental transmission, confirmed by comprehensive virological tests in the placenta, along with symptoms and clinical manifestations in the neonate [29] .",

Despite being negative on the day of delivery, and neonate being nursed in NICU separate from mother, neonate tested positive on day 14 of life. Since the mother tested negative just before delivery, as per the existing guidelines, the neonate was not tested immediately after birth. However, the mother's clinical condition deteriorated postpartum, she received intensive care and died on day 11 postpartum. Given the two prior COVID 19 positive reports of the mother (though the most recent report was negative), a strong suspicion of COVID 19 related aetiology as a cause of maternal death was kept. Therefore, the neonate was tested late, on day 14 of life. Neonate tested positive for COVID 19, though the viral load as detected by Ct was below the detection cut off. Subsequent testing of the neonate though was advised, but the family did not come for follow-up as they relocated to another city (after maternal death). Neonate 6 was born by caesarean delivery at 34 weeks gestation with a birth weight of 1800 g. Neonate received NICU care due to prematurity and low birth weight. The mother also needed postpartum obstetric care and was kept under monitoring in the high dependency unit (HDU). On day 10 postpartum, the mother developed symptoms of fever and cough and was tested for COVID 19, which was reported to be positive. Hence, the neonate was tested too on day 12 of life, which was reported positive. It is to be noted that mother and neonate were being cared for in the COVID block, where health care professionals followed the recommendation of donning complete PPE.",

Moreover, in the unit, strict adherence to PPE and precautions during procedures was followed, to minimise the probability of transmission by health care providers. Universal surveillance of all health care providers entering NICU (including mothers) and admitted neonates in NICU continues to be an arguable point because of the uncertainty whether such surveillance would indeed prevent the illness in neonates and the psychological and economic burden which such a strategy may result in [43] . Shah et al [33] have described the categorization of maternal and neonatal COVID 19 illness as either confirmed, probable, possible, unlikely, or non-infected based on clinical symptoms, RTPCR positivity, type of samples tested for COVID 19 and timing of testing. As per this classification, in this cohort, all the mothers were classified as maternal infection during pregnancy as the virus was detected by PCR in respiratory samples in all of them. None of the stillbirths or abortions can be classified as congenital infection with intrauterine fetal death due to COVID 19, as an autopsy or placental or fetal tissue examination could not be performed. One neonate is classified as confirmed congenital infection in a live-born neonate (tested positive by RTPCR within 24 h of birth). Since none of the neonatal samples was taken at birth or within 12 h, none of the neonatal infection can be classified as a neonatal infection acquired intrapartum. Six neonates are classified as a probable neonatal infection acquired postpartum and 56 neonates are classified as not infected.",

However, the results of the viral load need to be interpreted with caution as the number of neonates in whom viral load is available is small for us to deduce concrete conclusions.

            "text": "Therefore, the current data in the literature is insufficient to conclude the transmission in breastfeeding. In this existing scenario of a dearth of concrete evidence, benefits of breastfeeding vs harms of formula feeding by palade, cost and inability to maintain acceptable hygiene with top feed and hence higher incidence of morbidities and mortality due to top milk should be weighed upon, especially in developing nations. It is reassuring that despite most neonates being roomed-in with mother and breastfed since birth (51 of the 65), only 4 neonates (7.8%) tested positive. The risk of transmission through mother and breastfeeding appears to be low if appropriate precautions are taken. This is all the more important for resource-limited settings where ensuring 3 to 6 feet distance between mother and neonate due to space constraints, availability of separate staff to provide expressed breast milk to the neonate and adequate supply of breast pumps and training of mother in manual expression may not be entirely possible.",

Preterm rate of as high as 63% and caesarean delivery rate of 80% has been described in the systematic review of 9 studies by Smith et al.

Information on the viral load by cycle threshold of specific SARS-CoV-2 infection makes it more robust. It provides critical insights into clinical and epidemiological details in the perinatal period, the viral load and infectivity of the cases and hence adds to the sparse data presently available from developing countries.
