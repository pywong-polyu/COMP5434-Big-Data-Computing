Preterm delivery occurred in a higher proportion of women with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the PAN-COVID and AAP-SONPM registries compared to contemporaneous and historical national data from uninfected women in the UK and USA. The majority of preterm deliveries occurred between 32 + 0 and 36 + 6 weeks' gestation. SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy did not appear to be associated with a clinically significant effect on fetal growth, adverse neonatal outcome or the rate of stillbirth. Although maternal death was uncommon, the rate was higher than expected based on UK and USA population data, which is likely explained by underascertainment of women affected by milder or asymptomatic infection in pregnancy in the PAN-COVID study, although not in the AAP-SONPM study.",

For obstetric outcomes, in PAN-COVID overall and in those with confirmed infection in PAN-COVID and AAP-SONPM, respectively, maternal death occurred in 0.5%, 0.5% and 0.2% of cases, early neonatal death in 0.2%, 0.3% and 0.3% of cases and stillbirth in 0.5%, 0.6% and 0.4% of cases. Delivery was preterm (< 37 weeks' gestation) in 12.0% of all women in PAN-COVID, in 16.1% of those women with confirmed infection in PAN-COVID and in 15.7% 574 Mullins et al. of women in AAP-SONPM. Extreme preterm delivery (< 27 weeks' gestation) occurred in 0.5% of cases in PAN-COVID and 0.3% in AAP-SONPM. Neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection was reported in 0.9% of all deliveries in PAN-COVID overall, in 2.0% in those with confirmed infection in PAN-COVID and in 1.8% in AAP-SONPM; the proportions of neonates tested were 9.5%, 20.7% and 87.2%, respectively. The rates of a small-for-gestational-age (SGA) neonate were 8.2% in PAN-COVID overall, 9.7% in those with confirmed infection and 9.6% in AAP-SONPM. Mean gestational-age-adjusted birth-weight Z-scores were \u22120.03 in PAN-COVID and \u22120.18 in AAP-SONPM. Conclusions The findings from the UK and USA registries of pregnancies with SARS-CoV-2 infection were remarkably concordant. Preterm delivery affected a higher proportion of women than expected based on historical and contemporaneous national data. The proportions of pregnancies affected by stillbirth, a SGA infant or early neonatal death were comparable to those in historical and contemporaneous UK and USA data. Although maternal death was uncommon, the rate was higher than expected based on UK and USA population data, which is likely explained by underascertainment of women affected by milder or asymptomatic infection in pregnancy in the PAN-COVID study, although not in the AAP-SONPM study. The data presented support strong guidance for enhanced precautions to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy, particularly in the context of increased risks of preterm delivery and maternal mortality, and for priority vaccination of pregnant women and women planning pregnancy.",

Two pregnancy registries in English-speaking countries have analogous aims and a similar design. The UK and Global Pregnancy and Neonatal Outcomes in COVID-19 (PAN-COVID) study utilizes a dataset that collected outcome data focused on determining the effect of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the risk of miscarriage, FGR, stillbirth, preterm delivery, vertical transmission (suspected or confirmed) and early-onset symptomatic neonatal SARS-CoV-2 infection 11 . It includes fields on ultrasound diagnosis and neonatal care that are not included in other more general studies. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Section on Neonatal-Perinatal Medicine (SONPM) National Perinatal COVID-19 Registry collects data on women who have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 in samples obtained from 14 days before delivery to 3 days after delivery. Both registries collected maternal demographic and symptomatology data, as well as perinatal and neonatal outcome. In this study, we report the outcomes of pregnancies with SARS-CoV-2 infection, using data from the PAN-COVID study and the AAP-SONPM National Perinatal COVID-19 Registry.",

The PAN-COVID study was sponsored by Imperial College London, London, UK and funded by the United Kingdom Research Institute and the National Institute for Health Research. The protocol for the PAN-COVID study is detailed elsewhere 11 , and we describe briefly the methodology below. The study had 177 participating centers in the UK and 10 countries around the world. The main objective of the PAN-COVID study was to establish a UK and international disease registry for women with confirmed or suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection in pregnancy. Women with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection were included because capacity for SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction testing in the UK was limited to hospital-admitted patients until April 2020 and we expected the majority of women with infection not to have received testing before this time. SARS-CoV-2 infection was considered suspected when an untested pregnant woman reported symptoms that her healthcare professionals thought were likely due to SARS-CoV-2. As such, until 30 May 2020, the PAN-COVID study collected data on women with COVID-19-defining symptoms but no confirmatory test, on women who had a positive test and on women with COVID-19 symptoms and a confirmatory test. From 1 July 2020, symptom data on all participants were collected.",

Recruitment was by verbal consent to limit person-to-person contact during study conduct in the pandemic, and retrospective inclusion was permitted. Weekly contact open sessions were co-ordinated by North West London Clinical Research Network (CRN) and the study management team to motivate staff to recruit and enter data. The UK CRN support network of research midwives was facilitated by Urgent Public Health research designation. The study was registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN68026880).

Maternal mortality in both the PAN-COVID and AAP-SONPM registries was lower than in other cohort studies of pregnant women admitted to hospital with SARS-CoV-2 infection 8, 15, 16 .

When compared to the estimated infection fatality ratio of 0.03% in women and men aged 15-44 years in the UK REACT 2 study 18 , on the assumption that only 10% of infections in pregnant women are diagnosed, our expected mortality ratio would be 10-fold less than we report, and this accords more closely with the reported fatality ratio.",

Early in the pandemic, most USA centers implemented universal COVID-19 testing of all pregnant women admitted to the labor and delivery unit. In both registries, when the cause of death was known, all maternal deaths were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and, hence, each death represents an additional mortality above the expected baseline rate. Neither registry reported any neonatal deaths attributable to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The proportion of pregnancies affected by ENND was no higher than would be expected based on England and Wales Office for National Statistics (ONS) data (0.2%) 19 or on the USA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data (0.38%) 20 . An increase in prematurity might be expected to lead to an increase in ENND; however, most preterm babies were born between 32 and 36 weeks' gestation, when the risk for ENND is low.",

This is reassuring given that case reports of pregnant women with MERS or SARS infection suggested increased rates of stillbirth and FGR 4 . Common to both registries was a high proportion of cases with preterm delivery: 12.0% in PAN-COVID and 15.7% in AAP-SONPM. The rate was 60% higher in PAN-COVID than is expected for England and Wales based on ONS data for January to September 2020 (7.5%) 22 , and 57% higher in AAP-SONPM than expected based on USA National Vital Statistics reports for 2018 (10%) 24 . As the proportion of women with spontaneous labor and preterm vaginal delivery was low, a high proportion of preterm deliveries may have been due to physician concern about adverse effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on the maternal or fetal condition.",
