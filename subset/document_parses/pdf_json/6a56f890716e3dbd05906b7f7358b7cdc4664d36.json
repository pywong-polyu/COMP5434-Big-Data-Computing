Among them, postoperative telehealth visits have proven to be safe [4] , but there is a paucity of data in the hand surgery literature. Moreover, their impact on the broader postoperative course is incompletely understood. If a substantial percentage of encountered postoperative visits cannot be managed virtually, telehealth visits would carry a high rate of necessary conversion to in-person evaluation, thus creating redundant clinical visits often within a global billing period. This would, on average, increase the number of visits performed within the postoperative course, effectively costing rather than saving resources.",

The goal of this study is to assess postoperative healthcare utilization in patients seen via telehealth for at least one clinical visit after upper extremity surgery and determine the conversion rate to in-person evaluation. We hypothesized the in-person conversion rate to be minimal, and that postoperative healthcare utilization would be similar to matched controls. After Thomas Jefferson University Institutional Review Board approval (#13D.432), with a waiver of informed consent per institutional protocol, a database query was performed to identify all patients seen for a postoperative telehealth visit (CPT code: 99024) between April and May 2020 within the hand and upper extremity division of a single, large orthopedic practice. Electronic medical records were reviewed, and patients lacking follow-up through clinical discharge (defined as the clinical visit at which the treating surgeon released the patient to as-needed follow-up) were excluded. Patient demographics were recorded in addition to the surgical procedure code, the total number of postoperative visits, days to clinical discharge, complications, and reoperations. Details of the individual telehealth visits were also tracked and recorded, including the modality used (audiovisual versus audio only), any specific changes to the postoperative treatment course made during the visit, frequency of radiographic evaluation incorporation, and any therapeutic interventions administered during the visit.",

These included oral antibiotic therapy initiation, physical therapy initiation, and oral steroid initiation. Patients were directly discharged to as-needed followup from 37 (61.7%) telehealth visits, and the remaining 23 (38.3%) visits were followed by a subsequent telehealth or in-person visit.

The efficacy of postoperative telehealth visits after upper extremity surgery has been established in the literature, and prior investigations support the current findings [4, 5] . In a randomized trial comparing telehealth to in-person visits at standardized intervals after rotator cuff repair, Kane et al. found equivalent efficacy between the two groups [4] . Although in-person conversion rates were not directly reported, none of the three reported complications in the telehealth group required in-person evaluation, with only one among the roughly 75 telehealth visits requiring in-person follow-up secondary to technical difficulties [4] . Similarly, Grandizio et al. prospectively assessed 57 patients seen for a single telehealth visit after upper extremity surgery. Four complications were recognized during the virtual encounters and were managed without requiring in-person evaluation [6] . Beyond orthopedic applications, postoperative telehealth visits have been associated with tremendous cost savings [7] , and a 2.8% rate of necessary conversion to in-person follow-up [8] , similar to the 1.7% rate found in this study. Combining what is now known regarding the efficacy of telehealth visits in the postoperative period, it may be reasonably concluded that telehealth incorporation represents resource savings in the postoperative period after upper extremity surgery. The overwhelming majority of encountered scenarios can be appropriately managed without risking necessary, redundant in-person evaluation.",

Patient satisfaction with telehealth is largely comparable to in-person visits [9, 13, 14] , though some investigations have found a higher rate of satisfaction associated with postoperative visits [15] . This is likely attributable, at least in part, to the already established patient-provider rapport compared to new patient visits and the value of decreasing patient burden after surgery. Importantly, the existing evidence suggests that telehealth visits can be incorporated without sacrificing patient satisfaction.",

However, to ensure efficacious resource savings, it is critical to tailor therapeutic interventions around or within the virtual visit. In our study, radiographic evaluation was incorporated into 15% of telehealth visits, all scheduled and obtained prior to the visit, and suture removal instructions were given in four visits. Tofte et al. reported the successful incorporation of guided patient suture removal after carpal tunnel release [16] . While such strategies are not universally appropriate for all patients and may be avoided through the use of absorbable sutures in some instances, it is important to consider safe and effective strategies to maximize the seamless addition of telehealth visits within the postoperative course.",

First, there was likely selection bias in which the treating surgeons chose which patients would be seen via telehealth. Second, which postoperative visit (first, second, etc.) was selected by the treating surgeon also introduced a possibility of bias. Third, the included visits took place relatively soon after the widespread adoption of telehealth use, and, as such, the effectiveness of use has likely since improved. Some visits were conducted using audio communication only, which, given the rapid advancements in telehealth platforms, should be avoided. Fourth, complications were rare across both groups, and had they been more common, it is unclear if all would have been recognized during telehealth visits. However, the previously cited literature and complete follow-up through clinical discharge within our study suggest that the risk of this is small. Fifth, the study population included a wide range of surgical procedures. It remains unclear if telehealth visits are more or less effective after certain surgeries. Despite its limitations, this study establishes a rate of redundant inperson evaluation required after postoperative upper extremity telehealth visits and resolves theoretical concerns that telehealth incorporation may prolong postoperative courses or add to the total number of visits required after surgery.",
