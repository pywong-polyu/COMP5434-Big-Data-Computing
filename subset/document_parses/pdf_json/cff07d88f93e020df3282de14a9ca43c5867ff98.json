These studies provided the experience for the implementation of PrEP, primary data of the cascade of PrEP implementation, effectiveness, safety, and possible effects of PrEP use on sexual behaviors in China. 18 Based on the evidences from these studies, the first Chinese expert consensus on PrEP was published in 2020. 19 However, the cost-effectiveness of PrEP in the presence of HIVDR remains unclear in China.",

Our wider search, removing \"China\" or \"Chinese\" yielded two relevant articles related to modelling studies on PrEP cost-effectiveness incorporating the HIVDR among US MSM. They found that PrEP use was cost-effective in the presence of HIVDR among US MSM. However, differences in HIV control strategies, HIV incidence, drug types and costs, resistance testing, cost-effectiveness threshold between China and US, it is necessary to investigate the cost-effectiveness of PrEP in the condition of HIVDR in China.",

However, there are many differences in HIV control strategies, such as HIV incidence, drug types and costs, resistance testing, cost-effectiveness threshold between China and US, so it is necessary to investigate the costeffectiveness of PrEP in the presence of HIVDR in China. This will fill the gaps of previous studies on the cost-effectiveness of PrEP in China without considering HIVDR 24\u221226 or only considering acquired drug resistance (ADR). 27 Jiangsu Province is a well-developed province with 80\u00a27 million people (2019) in China, which GDP per capita closely follows Beijing and Shanghai. There were over 31,000 people living with HIV (PLWH) in Jiangsu by the end of 2020. 28 Among newly diagnosed people living with HIV, the proportion infected through same sex sexual activity increased from 28\u00a20% in 2008 to 56\u00a20% in 2020. 28 Since 2019, Jiangsu province has set up HIV PrEP and PEP service network with 28 outpatient service points of PEP. 29 However, PrEP have not been implemented in Jiangsu to date. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic compartmental model including transmitted drug resistance (TDR) and ADR, and calibrated this model with the multi-source data: the numbers of annual newly diagnosed people living with HIV and newly treated individuals at four levels of CD4 cell counts (CD4 >=500 cells/mL, CD4 350\u2212499 cells/mL, CD4 200\u2212349 cells/mL, and CD4 <200 cells/mL), total treated individuals, and deaths among the treated individuals from 2009 to 2019 in Jiangsu Province, China. The model was validated by the dynamic prevalence of TDR and ADR. We evaluated the HIV epidemic under several PrEP coverages with or without expanded ART, and then calculated the cost-effectiveness of various PrEP scenarios. Our results will provide theoretical support for Jiangsu to expand PrEP and ART in the presence of TDR and ADR.",

Costs and QALYs were discounted by 3% per year, 23 and all costs were expressed in 2020 U.S. dollars (U.S. $). 51 The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) for each strategy was calculated and compared with those of the status quo and the next best strategy. Using WHO standards, 52 strategies with an ICER less than the gross domestic product per capita (GDP per capita $18,100 for Jiangsu in 2020 53 ) were considered as highly cost-effective, those with an ICER less than three times the GDP per capita as cost-effective ($54,300), other with an ICER more than three times the GDP per capita as not cost-effective, and those ICER<0 as cost-saving.

            "text": "Our results showed that ART implementation alone would prevent 19% of HIV infections but increase drug resistance prevalence by 5\u00a24% over a 30-year period, ART plus PrEP would futher decrease the incidence. These results were consistent with the study by Abbas et al. 21 But they found that expanded ART plus PrEP would increase resistance prevalence, which may be attributed to the different initial DR prevalence between Africa and China. Despite the increasing proportion of new TDR infections, the incidence of TDR infections decreased. This apparent paradox has been shown by Supervie et al. 20 that resistance appears to be increasing, but actually is decreasing. When PrEP interventions are implemented, we recommend to employ the number of new drug-resistance infections, rather than the proportion of new drug-resistant infections to monitor drug resistance in the entire population. 40 The cost-effectiveness of PrEP depends on a variety of factors, including HIV prevalence, PrEP costs, the thresholds of cost-effectiveness and whether combined with ART. Our results demonstrated that daily oral PrEP targeting 20\u221280% MSM without expanded ART, with a $77,862\u2212$98,338 per QALY gained, is not costeffective. These results were consistent with the study in Zhang et al. 27 that 20\u221280% PrEP among high-risk MSM is not cost-effective, with an ICER of $46,813 \u2212$52,008, and the cost reduction in PrEP by about 50% would achieve cost effectiveness. But it was different from the results in Hu et al. 25 and Li et al. 26 that PrEP is cost-effective among Chinese MSM, without considering the drug resistance. Taking ADR and TDR into consideration, our model evaluated the undermined effectiveness of PrEP on drug resistant infections. Impact of relative effectivenss of PrEP against drug-resisitant infections on ICERs was showed in the sensitive analysis (Figures 5 and S5\u2212S10 in Appendix). And we not only evaluated the number of total HIV incidence prevented by PrEP but also the drug-resistant incidence averted by PrEP. Susceptible infected with drug resistant strains would increase the extra expenses including the costly second-line drugs and HIV genotype test, and the QALYs of drug resistant infections was lower. Our findingswere also different from those of Drabo et al. 22 and Shen et al. 23 that PrEP is cost-effective in the presence of drug resistance for MSM in San Francisco and Los Angeles. Two reasons may explain this discrepancy. First, HIV prevalence and drug-resistant prevalence were different between China and US. For example, the initial HIV prevalence in our study (10\u00a22%) was lower than that among MSM in San Francisco (16%) and Los Angeles (24%), and the initial prevalence of ADR in our study was lower than 2%, but it was 25% in San Francisco, and the prevalence of multidrug resistance was 4\u00a279% in Los Angeles. 22, 23 Second, the cost-effectiveness thresholds of 3 times GDP per capita ($10,500 in 2020) in China is much lower than that in US ($63,543 in 2020). 54 Our findings demonstrated that the cost of PrEP and the coverage of PrEP have important impact on the ICER. If the cost of PrEP reduced by about 64% (annual cost $588), 50% PrEP + 90% ART would be highly costeffective ( Figure 5 ). Given that patents for PrEP (Truvada) produced by Gilead Company will expire in 2024 in China, 55 Chinese government has started negotiations with the pharmaceutical industry, and there were two types of generic TDF/FTC (Glyke and Taihe) have been approved in China in 2020, 56,57 so a lower price can be expected. High costs of PrEP have been identified as common barriers to PrEP use 58, 59 and insurance systems excluding PrEP lead to further barriers to expand PrEP coverage. 60 A meta-analysis showed the acceptability was 14\u00a20\u221236\u00a28% when payment was required, and if PrEP was provided for free, the acceptability would increase to 46\u00a21\u221261\u00a20%. 61 The Chinese government may consider to negotiate with Gilead Company for bulk purchasing, or widely use of genericdrug to obtain PrEP at a lower price, and incorporate the PrEP into the medical insurance system to support the implementation of PrEP.",

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, we assumed that routine HIV testing for PrEP user was implemented every 3 months without considering that people using PrEP might move straightly from susceptible to diagnosed. We performed sensitivity analysis ( Figure 5 ) by increasing the diagnose rate to account for this and found that it had little impact on the ICER. In contrast, low adherence to routine screening might compromise the effectiveness of PrEP. Our sensitive analysis mitigates this by accounting for the variations in effectiveness of PrEP on the ICERs. Second, we did not have a standard price of Truvada in China. We collected the price of PrEP from published papers and the website 25, 27, 42, 62, 63 and used the average annual cost ($1638\u00a29) in this analysis. The annual costs of PrEP are varied from $147\u00a29 62 to $3444\u00a28 25, 27 as shown in the sensitive analysis and it may change the results of the cost-effectiveness of PrEP. The explanations of the results should be cautious. Third, we assumed an 8% annual rate of PrEP attrition, based on a cohort study in San Francisco, 64 for the absence of real-world data among Chinese MSM. But our results should be qualitatively robust by changing it from 1% to 50% per year in sensitivity analyses. Fourth, we assumed that drugresistant infections switched to second-line drugs in time, and all would be tested for drug resistance. This may increase the costs of the second-line drugs, but it has little impact on the result due to low acquired drugresistance rate. Fifth, our analysis only evaluated the cost-effectiveness of daily oral PrEP, without directly considering on-demand oral PrEP and long-acting injectable PrEP, 65\u221269 which may have lower costs and better adherence. We varied the costs and effectiveness of daily oral PrEP in the sensitive analysis to account for these potential effects and the rigorous cost-effectiveness analysis for on-demand and injectable PrEP would be left for further investigation. Finally, the cost-effectiveness of PrEP among Jiangsu cannot be simply generalized to China as a whole due to the great difference of HIV incidence and GDP. Setting-specific analysis was needed based on the local epidemic and economic level.",
