Currently most of the deep learning methods work on protein ligand pocket datasets for various predictions. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning (RL) based method for predicting the optimized ligand pose where the RL agent also identifies the binding site based on its training. In order to apply various reinforcement learning techniques, we suggest a novel approach to represent the protein ligand complex using graph CNN which would help utilize both atomic and spatial features. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an RL based approach has been put forward for predicting optimized ligand pose.",

It has indicated a need for expediting efficient computational methods for drug discovery. To address this need, the Government of India launched a drug discovery hackathon (DDH) 1 in July 2020 to develop computational methods for COVID-19 drug discovery, and to extrapolate these algorithms to other generic drug discovery challenges. In this work, we explore one of these problems statements which requires the application of reinforcement learning algorithms to the prediction of ligand pose during protein ligand interaction. 1 https://innovateindia.mygov.in/ddh2020/ Computational methods for identification of the right ligand pose have been explored for a while. Structure based virtual screening methods, such as molecular docking, have been widely used for identification of the lead molecule for virtual screening [4] . Until the last few years, molecular docking was the only method for protein ligand interaction identification. In this, most of the docking tools focus towards calculation of binding energy or binding affinity, where the ligands and their poses are then ranked according to their score. A common challenge is that often the ligand pose chosen by these methods need to be manually checked, as a good score may or may not lead to the correct biological interaction.",

This was achieved by training the agent with the estimation of molecule quality under a pre-trained network in chemical space and with a scoring function to guide the model in producing output examples which are still representative of the original chemical domain. It was observed that the agent could produce structurally similar analogues, even when all such compounds were removed from the training set.",

In our formulation, the reinforcement learning agent is responsible for identifying both the binding site and the optimized ligand pose. We propose to train the reinforcement learning model based on existing protein-ligand complexes. The hypothesis presented is that training on protein-ligand complexes with known binding pose will help the reinforcement learning algorithm to approximate the underlying molecular interactions by making use of the input atomic and spatial Protein-ligand docking can be viewed as a combinatorial optimization problem [18] which involves searching and selection sub-stages. Deep learning approaches are function approximators [19] which are capable of identifying underlying feature interactions provided as part of the input features. Reinforcement learning approximates an optimization function in the form of optimal policy [20] , which helps in maximizing the total reward. Deep reinforcement learning strategies combine deep learning function approximation with reinforcement learning's optimization capabilities. In the case of proteinligand docking, the reinforcement learning algorithm approximates the pose prediction function. The optimal policy learned by the algorithm generates the ligand pose which can improve the protein-ligand interaction at binding site, thus implicitly combining the searching and selection process, which earlier existed as separate, explicit processes.",

The gradient of the reward function is very flat far from the goal, with a steep gradient as the agent nears the goal. This steep gradient helps the agent to quickly approach the goal, but the successive improvements in the policy are limited, as a small improvement in policy translates to a comparatively higher reward, thus slowing the progress once the agent has approached the goal. \u2022 Sine hyperbolic: This reward function has the form R(x) = 1/ sinh(x a ) and behaves somewhat similarly to the inverse, however, the parameter a allows some control over the steepness of slope away from the maximum. \u2022 Gaussian: This reward system is Gaussian inspired and has the form R(x) = exp (\u2212x 2 /(2\u03c3 2 )). The reward function is uniformly distributed with a steep gradient when approaching the goal, and flattens out at the goal and away from it. This helps the agent to quickly approach the goal. The drawback of this reward function is that once the agent has approached the goal, it would prefer to revolve around the goal, rather than converging onto it, as the cumulative reward is higher near the goal as compared to at the goal due to the gradient. The parameter \u03c3 may be used to change the slope. \u2022 Combination: It is possible to envisage a reward function created by combining the exponential and the sinh functions, so that its slope is steep both away from the maximum and close to the maximum. It is also possible to add a step function so that going far away from the maximum incurs not just a lower reward, but also a penalty. This would enable the RL algorithm to learn to stay near the maximum and also lead to faster optimization. \u2022 Stochastic weight averaging: Averaging the reward function at each step over several preceding steps can reduce the learning instabilities caused by noisy gradient updates [35] . This also helps the RL to remember the highly rewarded policies, and to optimize accordingly. For an initial implementation of the DDPG algorithm, the Sine hyperbolic reward function may be chosen, since it has the attractive feature of a parameter that controls the steepness of its slope, and thus can be tuned to reach the goal quickly. Other reward functions can be tried based on the performance of this reward function.",

As represented in figure 4 , the training is done with known protein-ligand complexes. The input protein-ligand complex is separated out into protein and ligand representations. These separate molecular representations are used by the RL network to train the molecular graph and the corresponding optimal policy. In each of the training iterations, the RL network produces a ligand pose, which is compared against the original ligand in the protein-ligand complex for the rmse calculation. The rmse of the generated pose is compared to the terminating condition, which in this case is set to 2\u00c5. In the case of an unfavourable rmse, ie. rmse > 2\u00c5, the RL network gets updated as per the DDPG policy update equation J(\u03c0) = E(r \u03b3 |\u03c0), using a function of rmse as the policy reward. The training process would eventually produce an optimal policy network which The testing ( fig. 5 ) also proceeds in an iterative manner. The RL Network in this case accepts a protein and ligand as input. Unlike the training phase, where the optimal ligandpose is known, in testing phase, the optimal ligand pose is to be predicted; hence, rmse can no longer be used as a stopping condition for optimal ligand pose generation.

The right binding pose is an indicator of true interactions between the amino acid residues and ligand molecule which eventually means the identification of required binding energy and binding affinities. The current state of the art methods like molecular docking utilize binding energy or binding affinity for finding the ligand pose. Often the predicted pose is not the biologically relevant pose, which could be due to various reasons. A known reason is that due to the compute power required to cover the entire chemical space for identifying the right ligand and ligand-pose, the biologically relevant pose may be missed by the docking algorithm. The RL approach suggested in this paper mathematically approximates a function to generate ligand docking poses utilising the protein and ligand atomic features, which would be learned from existing protein-ligand complexes. This is expected to reduce the overall search space for the identification of the right docking pose, hence making the docking process computationally cheaper compared to traditional methods. This method also eliminates the need to predefine the active sites in the protein, since the active site is predicted as part of the optimization process in this formalism.",

This trade-off can be mitigated by using a graphical representation with the help of GraphCNN, which has shown great promise in terms of computational effectiveness in comparison to the 3D convolution network. The GraphCNNs are also good for representing sparse connected data. The GraphCNN representation preserves the atomic interactions through connected graph edges, but loses out on the structural representation. In our suggested approach, we mitigate this by encoding the spatial features as node features.

We choose DDPG as our RL algorithm, since the state-space is continuous. However, DDPG has been known to suffer from convergence issues [36] . The algorithm could converge sub-optimally or even diverge from solution if rewarding policies are not identified early on in training, making proper selection of reward function vital to its success. Even in the absence of reward, actor and critic training may trigger non-negligible updates that cause the actor-critic network to saturate very quickly.
