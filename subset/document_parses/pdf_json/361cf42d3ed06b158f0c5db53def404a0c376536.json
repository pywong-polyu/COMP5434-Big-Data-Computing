It is mostly due to the continuous emergence of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamase from various environments followed by their rapid dissemination and selection in clinical settings. The warming of Earth's climate is the other global threat facing human society, in particular with the Arctic regions experiencing a twice faster warming than the global average and permafrost affected by widespread thawing. A potentially dreadful combination of these two threats would be the release and dispersion of harmful microbes that have remained confined to largely uninhabited Arctic regions, or are stored dormant in permafrost.",

The large datasets obtained from high throughput sequencing was assembled in contigs and their protein-gene contents predicted. We used exhaustive similarity searches to perform taxonomical assignments of bacterial, archaeal, and eukaryotic organisms, as well as DNA viruses. In addition, we specifically identified \u03b2lactamase genes and their prevalence per bacterial genome estimated through the detection of two universal single copy genes.",

The DNA content of the various samples was found to be highly variable, not strictly correlated with the depth or radio-carbon-based deposit age, and most likely linked to the global density of microbes trapped in the corresponding permafrost layers. Bacteria account for more than 90% of the contigs in most samples, followed by Eukaryotes and Archaea (always lower than 10%). Viruses represented less than 2% of all contigs in all samples. The taxonomic profiles of surface cryosoils and deep permafrost samples exhibited a high diversity, including between permafrost samples originating from various depths in the same borehole. In all samples, bacterial contigs carrying different \u03b2-lactamases from class A to D were identified.",

However, most samples (9/12) exhibited a high frequency of \u03b2-lactamase genes, with an estimated average close to 1 copy/bacterial genome. In addition to the well-documented reactivation of infectious ancient pathogens (bacteria, viruses, protozoa), we show now that global warming could contribute to the emergence of new antibiotic resistances through the mobilization by contemporary bacteria of ancient DNA released from thawing permafrost.",

Through their influence on the ecology of living organisms transmitting infectious pathogens, a warming climate strongly contributes to the spread of vector-borne diseases endemic in tropical regions to more temperate regions of the globe (3) (4) (5) (6) . This phenomenon is further amplified by the encroachment into pristine areas (e.g. tropical forests) by ever expanding human activities generating new risks through imponderable contacts with (mostly uncharted) microbial environments and their associated wild life hosts (7) (8) (9) (10) .",

Many of them, in particular among viruses, are unknown. If detected, the follow-up questions are: Are those microorganisms a threat for today's society? Could some of these viruses and bacteria represent an infectious hazard for humans, animals or plants? Can we identify microbes the metabolisms of which would accelerate the emission of greenhouse gases (e.g. methane, carbon dioxide) upon thawing? In order to answer these questions, a first step is to document what is frozen in there. Starting this, the technique of choice (and safest) for initiating this task is metagenomics. In contrast with targeted approaches, such as metabarcoding (i.e. PCR-amplified subset of environmental DNA), the bulk sequencing of non-amplified environmental DNA allows the detection of any living organisms (and virus) without restricting the analysis to a given domain or phylum. It thus preserves the possibility of unexpected discoveries. Without amplification, it also provides an image of the real abundance of the various species, although at the cost of a lower sensitivity. Finally, the analysis of metagenomic sequences obtained from gram quantities of ancient permafrost samples is much less sensitive to eventual contaminations and more suitable for site-to-site comparisons than the use of culture-based approaches.",

Yedoma permafrost may be especially prone to rapid thaw processes such as thermokarst and thermo-erosion (37) releasing not only carbon as greenhouse gases (38, 39) but also its formerly freeze-locked microbial content, in which we detected an unexpected high abundance of \u03b2-lactamases genes carried in the genomes (or plasmids) of a large phyletic diversity of cryosoil bacteria.",

Reads were quality checked with FASTQC (v0.11.7) (43). Identified contaminants were removed and remaining reads were trimmed on the 3' end using 30 as quality threshold with BBTools (v38.07) (44). Assemblies of filtered datasets were performed using MEGAHIT (v1.1.3) (45) with the following options: --k-list 33,55,77,99,127 --min-contig-len 1000. All filtered reads were then mapped to the generated scaffolds using bowtie2 (46) with the -very-sensitive option. To ensure a reliable taxonomic assignation, only scaffolds longer than 5kb were considered and submitted to metaGeneMark (v3.38) (47) with the default metagenome-style model. The predicted genes were then compared to the Refseq database (48) using the Diamond version of blastp (v0.9.31) (49) with an E-value threshold of 1e -5 and retaining only the best hit. The taxonomy of each scaffold was then inferred with a custommade script applying a LCA like method. At each rank, recursively, the taxonomy was conserved only if at least half of the annotated genes presented the same keyword. Unclassified scaffolds and potential chimeras were screened against Refseq with Diamond blastx (--sensitive option and E-value of 1e -5 ), in order to detect exons. Non-overlapping best hits were used. The above taxonomical protocol was applied and only eukaryotic scaffolds were conserved. An alternative taxonomical annotation at the single read level was computed by Kraken (v2) (50) using its standard database. This annotation was found to be much less comprehensive and less reliable and was not used further.",

To corroborate the high proportion of \u03b2lactamases genes initially computed from contigs larger than 5 kb in size, the same protocol was reiterated on an independent dataset constituted of the smaller contigs in the 2kb-5kb size range. It was further confirmed by analysing a smaller open-access metagenomic dataset obtained from Arctic permafrost samples from three different locations. Within each dataset, \u03b2-lactamase counts were normalized against three independent estimates of the number of equivalent complete bacterial genomes, using the detected number of two single copy marker genes : Phenylalanine-tRNA ligase (Uniprot accession W9B9D0) and 50S ribosomal protein L2 (NCBI accession WP_000301869.), as well as mean size of bacterial genomes.

A lesser range of variation (10 times) was observed between surface samples (Sample C to D) already suggesting that the sample age was not the main cause of these differences. Interestingly, very similar total numbers of usable base pairs and good quality reads were determined from the 250 ng of purified DNA used for sequencing) ( Table 2 ). Except for sample B (sequenced as shorter reads on a different platform), we observed no correlation between the initial DNA content of the sample and the number of usable good quality reads ( Table 2) , indicating that, once purified, all DNAs exhibited a similar quality.

As these values are linked to the complexity of the sample (species richness-number of different species-and their relative abundance -species evenness-), this is a first indication that the samples exhibit globally different microbial population compositions and structures. This was readily confirmed by the histogram of the G+C composition of the various contigs ( Fig. 1 ). Figure 1 illustrates the abundance of the various organisms associated with a given G+C% value in the various sample. Most of them exhibit a bimodal distribution with two peaks centered around 40% and 67% G+C, although with large variation of their relative proportions. Some of the samples exhibit almost no A+T rich organisms (e.g. C and P), while the predominant peak of G+C rich organism appears much reduced in others (e.g. L, Q, R). In two extreme cases (e.g. P and Q), a single of these peak was present suggesting the absence of whole classes of bacteria ( Fig. 1 ). Adjacent samples from the same borehole exhibit different profiles (e.g. L, N, R and Q) supporting the absence of large-scale homogenization of the microbial populations between strata of ancient frozen soils. This validates the notion that the DNA detected at various depths truly relates to the microbes syngenetically trapped at the time of permafrost formation. The large variations of the G+C profiles between samples suggest -prior to any taxonomical annotation -, that ancient permafrost layers could harbor vastly different microbial populations. Upon thawing, the ecological or medical consequences of their eventual reactivation and release probably do not lend themselves to generalization.",

This threshold is in fact a composite of several factors mixing the physical proportion of cells (or viral particles) of a given species (mostly unicellular) in each sample with other parameters strongly influencing our capacity to identify them by sequence similarities searches in the genomic database of known organisms. These parameters include the protein-coding density (high in viruses and prokaryotes, much lower in most eukaryotes), the fraction of the database corresponding to known members of the various phyla (high for bacteria, much lower for viruses, archaea and eukaryotes), the level of sequence similarity among homologous genes in the different domains (low in viruses, higher but variables in cellular organisms), and the proportion of ORFans in the various domains (low in Eukaryotes, high in prokaryotes, highest in viruses). Thus, for a similar coverage (i.e. relative proportion) in a metagenomics mixture, bacteria are more likely to be identified than Archaea and Eukaryotes, with viruses being the most likely to be overlooked (and remaining taxonomically unclassified). The comparisons of organism frequencies across domains are thus less reliable than within domains. Yet, the overwhelming predominance of DNA associated to the bacterial domain that characterizes all the samples is unlikely to be due to a bioinformatic/annotation bias. As depicted in Figure 2 , bacteria account for at least 95% of contigs (> 5kb) in most samples. This is true of all modern cryosoils and most ancient permafrost layers despite their different origins and DNA contents. A similar predominance for bacterial was indicated using a popular read-based annotation method (Fig. S2 ) (50) . However, we found this method to be less sensitive in identifying other cellular domains and viruses and was not used further in this study.",

Unfortunately, our experimental approach is only opening a window on viruses the genomes of which consist of dsDNA, while the most human threatening viruses are RNA viruses (e.g. Coronaviruses, Influenza viruses, Ebolaviruses). These viruses are also thought to be less resistant to long period of congelation in the environment, although there is no published data on the subject to best knowledge despite the availability of potential research materials (59) . We previously demonstrated the long term survival of two different types of giant DNA viruses from a sample of 28,000 year-old permafrost (23, 24) and were eager to explore how general and how diverse was the presence of DNA viruses at various locations. To our surprise, most of the samples we analyzed revealed only trace amount of viral DNA (Fig.2) . Contigs classified as viral represented 0.29% of the contigs of all samples while viruses (e.g. bacteriophages) are reputed to be the most numerous microbes in soils (reviewed in 60). Viruses represented close to or more than 1% of all contigs in only 4 samples: R (2%), N (1.9%), Q (0.9%), and M (0.8%). Fig. 8 shows the proportion of main families of viruses (with more than 10 total occurrences across all samples) in the samples for which at least 40 viral contigs were detected. Although the family distributions between theses samples were quite variable, the one with the largest number of viral contigs exhibited a clear predominance of Mimiviridae, followed by Pithoviridae (the prototype of which was previously isolated from ancient permafrost (23), unclassified viruses, and a smaller proportion of phages (Caudovirales).",

Although it originated from dead (or even extinct) organisms, the permafrost DNA content constitutes a historical library of genetic resources, from which useful elements (genes) can be reintroduced into modern organisms through bacterial transformation and/or lateral gene transfer in protozoa. Of particular interest are DNA fragments coding for bacterial virulence factors, and first of all, antibiotic resistance genes the origin of which has been shown to predate by far human history (61) (62) (63) (64) . Moreover, we focused our analyses on \u03b2-lactamases the specific sequence motifs of which are readily identifiable, and for the central role the continuous emergence of extended-spectrum \u03b2-lactamases (ESBL) (64-66) play in the spread of bacterial antibiotic multiple resistances. 67) were detected with high confidence (Fig. S3 ). Although these absolute numbers appear small compared to the total number of bacterial contigs ( Table 2 and Fig. 2 ), they suggest that most of the sampled bacteria harbours close to one copy of a \u03b2-lactamase gene, once normalized by the frequency of two known single copy number genes detected in each sample data set (Fig. 10 ).",

Most of the low yielding samples corresponded to ancient (subsurface) permafrost layers, although without a strict correlation with age. The sample from the Stanchikovskiy Yar (B) exhibited an exceptionally high DNA contents. However, once purified, the recovered DNA exhibited similar sequencing yields (i.e. number of read/ng) and assembled into contigs of similar sizes in average ( Table  2) . We interpret this result as suggesting that the lower efficiency in DNA recovery from the ancient samples mainly reflects a lower global density of microorganisms rather than DNA degradation alone (at least to a point precluding its sequencing). Such a result is important because it supports the hypothesis that ancient genes carried by the ancient DNA could be recycled within contemporary microorganisms though transformation.",

The sample displayed a large variability in the composition of their bacterial populations, as already visible from their different distribution of G+C% (Fig. 1) . Such variability was reflected at the taxonomical phylum level, where the globally dominant taxa (proteobacteria, actinobacteria, bacteroidetes, acidobacteria and firmicutes) were detected in highly variable relative proportions, including among samples from different depth in the same borehole (Fig. 3) . This suggests the absence of a significant mixing between the distinct microbiomes of the permafrost layers. However, the taxonomical diversity of these microbiomes below the phylum level (and the corresponding metabolic diversity) precludes the interpretation of their composition in terms of past properties of the corresponding horizon. Such intraphylum diversity is illustrated for the Proteobacteria in Fig. 4 . There is a growing opinion that taxonomy alone is insufficient to inform us on the complexity of soil processes (70) given the already high diversity of metabolisms and life-styles encountered in a given phylum (such as the proteobacteria). Globally, the phyla found to dominate the microbiomes in our cryosoil and permafrost samples do not differ from those already reported as most abundant in previous analyses of temperate soils (71) or permafrost (72, 73) . Those are proteobacteria (37%), actinobacteria (22%), bacteroidetes (12%), acidobacteria (6%), firmicutes (5%) and plantomycetes (5%) (Fig. 3) . However, even the most common phyla do exhibit very different proportions between samples: 74% to 16.2% for proteobacteria, 52.4% to 2.1% for actinobacteria, 34.5% to 1.9% for bacteroidetes (Fig. 3) . We noticed that the same phyla dominated both in the surface cryosoils and the permafrost sample except for the firmicutes that are almost uniquely found in subsurface samples (>1.1% at the surface, up to 24.3% in permafrost). However, this could be a bias of our limited number of samples. If not, it could be related to specific properties of these bacteria, such as endospore formation and anaerobiosis (e.g. Clostridia).",

Out of 9 analysed permafrost samples only 4 exhibited more than 1% amount of methanogenic archaeons (Bathyarcheota or Methanomicrobia) (Fig. 5) . Also interesting was the fact that 3 of these samples originated from various depth (respect. 12 m, 16m and 19m) of a the same borehole. This suggests that the presence of a sizable archaeal population is not a universal property of permafrost (even within the Yukechi site), and that its detailed composition is also variable and dependent of paleoenvironmental conditions during soil formation, as previously noticed (75) . Because of their apparent scarcity, the contribution of revived ancient frozen methanogens to methane production and global warming might be less than anticipated.",

This result does not seem consistent with the fact that the warm spring-summer period sees the growth of a dense vegetation cover, accompanied by a variety of mosses and fungi, and a proliferation of insects, which should leave lasting traces in the metagenome of permafrost, once buried. The lack of eukaryotic contigs can be explained in several ways, in the first place by the larger size of eukaryotic genomes. For a given amount of sequenced DNA (thus a given number of cells), a larger genome will result in a smaller coverage. However, statistically, the average size of the contigs is directly related to the coverage value. For a contig size of 5 kb, this value is \u22487, according to our assembly parameters (76) . It is therefore possible that many eukaryotes do not reach such threshold. This handicap is reinforced if the proportion of eukaryotic cells is much lower than that of bacteria, as it is for archaeons. The opposite hypothesis, though less likely, could be that the eukaryotic diversity is higher, thus reducing the coverage for each of them. Fragmentation of eukaryotic coding regions by introns, and their lower density due to large intergenic regions may also strongly decrease the probability of their identification by similarity searches in protein databases. Contigs without taxonomic assignment could therefore represent unaccounted eukaryotic contigs, but their proportion remains negligible (Fig. 2 , \"no taxonomy\" contigs). Finally, it is also possible that the DNA of eukaryotic origin is rapidly recycled into microbial DNA during the seasonal decomposition process that takes place in the superficial active layer before being perennially frozen in the deeper permafrost.",

This is an unexpected result given that bacteria form the vast majority of microorganisms present in our samples and are generally the hosts of a wide variety of bacteriophages. One possibility is that phage populations are in fact very large, but too diverse, thus preventing the assembly of sufficiently long contigs (> 5 kb) to be formed and counted. In addition, with their very few common genes and high sequence variability, bacteriophages are notoriously difficult to identify from partial metagenomic sequences (77) . They may therefore be included within contigs without taxonomic classification. Their frequent exchange of genes with different bacterial hosts can also cause them to be classified as chimeric contigs (Fig. 2) . However, even considering these adjustments, their proportion would never exceed more than a few %. Finally, it is also possible that the genomes of bacteriophages, like that of other viruses, are underrepresented because of the use of an inadequate DNA extraction protocol. Regarding eukaryotic viruses, our results are nevertheless less surprising, since they show a predominance for families of viruses infecting protozoa whose presence in ancient permafrost is known (33, 34) . In addition, some members of these viral families have been reactivated (23, 24) . We noticed that the phylum Amoebozoa, known to be that of the hosts of families of large DNA viruses (Mimivirus, Pithovirus, Fig. 8 ) is among the three predominant eukaryotic clades (samples R and N, in particular). Finally, on an optimistic note, we detected a very low proportion of viruses possibly pathogenic for animals (such as Asfarviridae and Iridoviridae), a result which puts into perspective the potential risk of viral infections triggered by the awakening of \"zombie\" viruses released by the thawing of permafrost. This danger could remain occasionally near the corpses of humans (21, 22) or animals (19, 20, 78, 79) well preserved in permafrost. Nevertheless, we also have to remember that none of the viruses we managed to isolate from ancient permafrost and surface cryosoil were present in large enough abundances to achieve sizable contigs from metagenomics data (24, 80) .",

This suggests that the high prevalence \u03b2-lactamase-encoding bacteria might be a common property of cryosols, relatively independent from their detailed composition (although this would need to be confirmed by more metagenomic studies explicitly designed for this purpose). We looked to confront our results to the existing literature. Unfortunately, we found very few studies allowing our findings to be compared with previous experimental studies. Indeed, almost all investigations of various environmental \"resistomes\" were performed on populations of culturable bacteria preselected for their antibiotic resistance. A few others are limited to a pre-defined bacterial species (e.g. Escherichia coli) (85) . We could found one study analysing the proportion of \u03b2-lactam-resistant bacteria within the global bacterial population of different agricultural soils, untreated or amended with manure (86) .

As the function of \u03b2lactamase in native soil microbial community is not known, our results should stimulate the building of new hypotheses. Certain soil microorganisms produce antibiotic \u03b2-lactams, including members of the Actinobacteria (e.g. Streptomyces species) (87) . We noticed that Actinobacteria are among the most abundant in the cryosoil microbiomes (Fig. 3) . Among eukaryotes, Fungi (also abundant in our samples, Fig. 7 ) have the metabolic resources to produce many complex lactam-containing compounds. They are the original source of two foundational \u03b2-lactam antibiotics: penicillin and cephalosporin (88) . The higher than usual abundance \u03b2-lactamase-carrying bacteria in the cryosoils might thus reflect a particular intense war between microbes occurring during the specific perennial decomposition and freezing/thawing processes characteristic of Polar Regions. However, antibiotic resistance genes may play roles outside of the simplistic \"war\" paradigm. At subminimal inhibitory concentrations, antibiotics can modulate bacterial gene expression thus acting as signalling molecules rather than weapons. In such context, \u03b2-lactamases might disrupt such signalling and interfere with quorum sensing (89) .",

Class A EBSL includes cephalosporinases and six types of dreaded carbapenemases (90) . Class B \u03b2lactamases are metallo-enzymes using zinc at their active center compared with a serine residue for other classes. They hydrolyze carbapenems and degrade all \u03b2-lactam agents except monobactams (90) . Class C \u03b2-lactamases derives from the ampC gene carried on the genome of many Enterobacteriaceae. Variants of these enzyme are known to reduce sensitivity to carbapenems (90) . Finally, class D \u03b2-lactamases, also known as oxacillinases (OXAs) evolved from degrading an extended spectrum of cephalosporins to hydrolyze carbapenems (90) . However, from their sequences alone (except for near 100% identical residues) it is impossible to predict the substrate range and the potential clinical risk of the diverse \u03b2-lactamases gene identified in our data set. Prompted by our previous discovery of \"living\" viruses in Siberian permafrost (as well as several others yet to be published), we initiated this large-scale metagenomic investigation at various sites to refine our assessment of the public health risk posed by the release of unknown ancient viruses in the context of global warming and the accelerated thawing of permafrost. We found that viruses constituted the smallest part of the various cryosoil microbiomes (Fig. 2) , consisting mostly of protozoan-infecting viruses and bacteriophages. Except in the immediate proximity of frozen animal or human remains, the risk of viral infections is thus probably negligible for us. However, this study revealed a new potential danger, consisting in the unexpected large abundance of \u03b2-lactamases genes carried in the genomes (or plasmids) of a large phyletic diversity of cryosoil bacteria. The DNA from these bacteria, dead, alive, or in a frozen dormancy, thus constitutes an immense reservoir of historical antibiotic resistance genes the transfer of which to contemporary human bacterial pathogens in a clinical setting might further contribute to the antibiotic resistance crisis, now considered one of the biggest public health challenges of our time.",
