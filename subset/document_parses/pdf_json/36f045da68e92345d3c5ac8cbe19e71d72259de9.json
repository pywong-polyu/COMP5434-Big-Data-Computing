Since, besides luck and skill, the probability of qualification depends on the design of the qualifiers, the study of these competitions forms an integral part of sports analytics. The Confederation of North, Central America and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF) announced a novel qualifying format for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in July 2019. However, the COVID-19 pandemic forced the organisers to return to a more traditional structure. The present chapter analyses how this reform impacted the chances of the national teams to qualify. It is found that the probability of participating in the FIFA World Cup finals can change by more than 5 percentage points under the assumption of fixed strengths for the teams. The idea behind the original design, to divide the contestants into two distinct sets, is worth considering due to the increased competitiveness of the matches played by the strongest and the weakest teams. We recommend mitigating the sharp nonlinearity caused by the seeding policy via a probabilistic rule to the analogy of the NBA draft lottery system.",

But this is not the case. Besides the performances of the competitors, the structural dimensions of the contest have a non-negligible effect on its expected outcome, too. Hwang (1982) and Horen and Riezman (1985) demonstrate the role of draws (pairings) in single-elimination tournaments. According to Krumer and Lechner (2017) , the winning probabilities in round-robin tournaments with sequential games between three and four players are influenced by the schedule. Lasek and Gagolewski (2018) evaluate the formats used in the majority of European top-tier football leagues with respect to their ability to produce accurate team rankings. Csat\u00f3 (2021c) discusses many problems of tournament design from an axiomatic perspective.",

For example, Mexico has such a high chance to qualify that even the presence of more contestants in its group cannot substantially worsen its outlook. Therefore, the chances for the next strongest teams of the United States, Costa Rica, and Honduras will decrease by a higher amount. Jamaica and Salvador have a higher probability of advancing to the play-offs in the undivided format, which balances the lower chance of direct qualification. For Canada, the 7th team in the FIFA World Ranking of July 2020, the divided format is especially disadvantageous since it closes the way of direct qualification. Figure 2 focuses on the connection between strength and the probability of qualification for both tournament formats. The relationship is monotonic, except for Jamaica and Canada using the World Football Elo Ratings: the latter team has a more difficult path to qualify as the seeding is based on the FIFA World Ranking. While this is not an inherent failure of the tournament designs, the distortion is clearly lower under the undivided format where the teams are not divided preliminarily into two distinct sets.",

For instance, the reform almost halves the probability of qualification for Salvador (from 20.2% to 11.78%) but it is roughly doubled for Canada Another important attribute of any tournament is the competi-tiveness of the matches played, quantified in Figure 3 through the average strength of the opponents. Note that in a round-robin group, this value is the highest for the weakest team. The divided tournament format essentially consists of two parallel contests, thus the six best teams of the Hexagonal group play against much stronger competitors than the lower-seeded teams, among which our metric remains approximately constant. Therefore, the weakest teams can expect more success in the divided format but the matches of the middle teams are more balanced under the undivided design. Finally, the leading CONCACAF nations should contest more competitive games on average in the divided format, too, since the Hexagonal contains fewer teams than the group in the last round of the undivided structure.",

The findings convey two basic messages. First, the sharp distinction of the teams in the divided format does not lead to misaligned incentives, that is, no team is interested in being ranked 7th to play among the lower-seeded teams instead of the Hexagonal group. Therefore, the divided tournament design is strategy-proof with respect to the initial ranking of the teams. As illustrated by the UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying tournament (Csat\u00f3, 2021a, Chapter 6.4) , this is far from guaranteed since the 7th ranked team can obtain the CONCACAF slot in the interconfederation play-offs for the 2022 FIFA World Cup after playing only one two-legged clash with a higher-ranked team.",

While this policy might intensify the chase for a particular position in the FIFA World Ranking, it could be unfair when small differences have such powerful implications. Thus it is worth considering a lot- tery system: the seeding of the teams can be determined by the FIFA World Ranking according to a probabilistic mechanism instead of the current rule. For instance, the fifth team that enters only the final group stage in the undivided tournament format should not necessarily be the 5th ranked one but the 5th ranked with a probability of 60%, the 6th with a probability of 30%, or the 7th with a probability of 10%. A similar procedure is used in the NBA draft lottery. Such a policy would also be able to mitigate the effects of changing from the divided to the undivided format as the comparison of Figures 1 and  4 highlights.",

It has turned out that the tournament design on its own can have quite a substantial role in the probability of playing in the FIFA World Cup finals, even amounting to 5-6 percentage points under the assumption of fixed Elo ratings for the teams. Since the initial division of the contestants into two sets in the original structure of the qualifiers has increased the competitiveness of the matches played by the strongest and the weakest teams without creating misaligned incentives for being seeded lower, this solution offers a reasonable alternative to the traditional hybrid format consisting of subsequent group and knockout stages. Finally, the sharp non-linearity caused by the deterministic seeding policy is recommended to be reduced via a probabilistic rule to the analogy of the NBA draft lottery.",
