Moreover, the CT scanner may act as a fomite of COVID-19 transmission. Therefore, the American College of Radiology (ACR) urges caution on such approach as a standard CT (especially in the early phases of COVID-19) should not dissuade a patient from viral testing, quarantine, and appropriate treatment [51] .

First, chest CT features, such as the predominant imaging pattern, depending on the time course of the infection when the patient is scanned [8, 14, 54] .

This was the most common predominant pattern in patients with COVID-19, and the second most prevalent pattern in non-COVID viral pneumonia. Heterogeneity was high and significant for both COVID-19 and non-COVID studies missing data. By including only immunocompetent patients, we tried to reduce such heterogeneity of CT findings. Differences in CT scanners and protocols can also be accounted for the high inter-study heterogeneity. Also, the higher prevalence of pleural effusion in non-COVID studies, especially in the studies by Henzler et al and Grieser et al, could be attributed to pulmonary congestion of critically ill patients rather than a common manifestation of viral pneumonia [29, 32] . Several studies herein discussed have attempted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of chest CT to diagnose COVID-19. However, many are at risk of bias due to Fig. 3 Forest plot of the pooled prevalence of \"mixed groundglass opacity and consolidation\" as the main CT pattern in COVID-19 (a) and non-COVID (b) studies. This was the most prevalent CT pattern in non-COVID viral pneumonia. Heterogeneity was high and significant for both groups methodology limitations, such as lack of a control population and questionable reference tests. As a result, CT estimates of sensitivity and specificity could be flawed [55] . For instance, Ai et al reported a sensitivity of 97% and suggested chest CT as a primary tool for the detection of COVID-19 in epidemic areas [6] . Bai et al also found that CT was abnormal in more than 90% of RT-PCR confirmed cases of COVID-19 [7] . On the other hand, Inui and colleagues described that only 61% of positive cases from Diamond Princess cruise ship had lung opacities on chest CT [10] . We believe the statistics of the latter comes closer to what would be expected in the general population, especially considering patients who are not very symptomatic and undergo chest CT scanning. Fig. 4 Forest plot of the pooled prevalence of \"predominantly or purely consolidation\" as the main CT pattern in COVID-19 (a) and non-COVID (b) studies. This was the least common CT pattern for both COVID-19 and non-COVID patients. Heterogeneity was high and significant for both COVID-19 and non-COVID studies Bai et al investigated the performance of radiologists in differentiating COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia [7] . The authors found that American radiologists had a surprisingly high accuracy in distinguishing COVID-19 from other viral pneumonia. However, the reproducibility of these findings is questionable, as authors considered as references in the control group patients that had word \"pneumonia\" in their radiology CT reports and a positive result from respiratory pathogen panel. Also, bilateral GGOs have a much broader differential, present in atypical infections, non-infectious processes, and even in healthy individuals [40, 41] .

Virtually all studies herein included had a retrospective 5 60-year-old man presenting with typical CT findings of COVID-19 confirmed by RT-PCR. a Axial chest CT demonstrates bilateral subpleural ground-glass opacities with superimposed smooth interlobular septal thickening (crazy-paving). b Coronal reformatted CT shows bilateral upper to mid lung gradient, though the lower lobes were involved to a lesser extent design, which is also a limitation. The exclusion of studies not available in English could have increased the probability of publication bias. Regarding selection bias, the etiological agents of non-COVID studies were not entirely comprehensible for all viruses associated with community-acquired viral pneumonia (e.g., rhinovirus). Few studies using chest CT in immunocompetent adults are available, as CT imaging is considered \"usually not appropriate\" by the ACR in this scenario [51] .
