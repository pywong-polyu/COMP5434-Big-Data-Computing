Since the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in wide scale social distancing in the UK, advice from the government has been to limit contact with others, and for older people and those with underlying health conditions to shield. 1 This has dramatically exacerbated social isolation within this population. The widespread use of face coverings has impeded communication by blocking the listener's view of the lips. 2 By forcing the wearing of masks and increasing the use of telemedicine, the COVID-19 pandemic has focused the minds of healthcare professionals on communicating with people with hearing loss. 3, 4 In this article we offer practical tips and resources for busy GPs, including the new Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) Toolkit for Deafness and Hearing Loss.",

Between 20% and 50% of primary care appointments are related to ear, nose, and throat (ENT) conditions. 5 It affects one in six of the UK population; one in two over the age of 70. Hearing loss is associated with poor social interaction, isolation, depression and anxiety, reduced quality of life, and increased risk of dementia. Treating hearing loss may be one of the most cost-effective ways of reducing someone's risk of dementia. 6 The wearing of a face mask may result in unintended consequences such as social isolation and poor mental wellbeing. This may predispose a large section of society to mask misery. 7 Acquired, age-related hearing loss occurs gradually. Your patients with deteriorating hearing may have noticed subtle clues such as the gradual fading of birdsong, increasing the volume on the television, muffled speech, or difficulty hearing in background noise. Often, it is the person's relatives or friends that notice changes in their loved one's hearing. The author Helen Keller pointed out that hearing loss cuts you off from people, and those with the condition will confirm this hasn't changed despite the use of increasingly sophisticated hearing aids. The hearing mechanisms themselves are damaged, reducing the value of amplification, so patients must increase their reliance on other communication cues such as lip movements, body language, and understanding of context. The extra processing required results in both slower communication and fatigue.",

During GP consultations, 49% of responders said that their GP surgery had a visual display screen, but one in seven responders had missed an appointment because they had missed being called from the waiting room. NHS England estimated that the cost of people who are Deaf or have hearing loss missing NHS appointments could be as high as \u00a315 million every year.

In a recent survey by Royal National Institute for the Deaf (RNID), more than 70% of responders said they 'did not feel confident that their communication needs would be met during a remote appointment' and over half admitted they had 'put off' seeking advice from their GP because of remote care, meaning they were at risk of missing out on vital medical care. An awareness of the potential barriers to effective communication and the implementation of some simple strategies will dramatically improve communication with your Deaf and hard of hearing patients.

Utilise Relay UK 11 for people with hearing loss; use video relay services (VRS), such as Interpreter Now, for British Sign Language (BSL) users. BSL Health Access 12 provides immediate, on-demand access to BSL interpreters for communication with Deaf people free of charge during this pandemic. Access to BSL interpreters takes place through two methods: VRS, where a BSL interpreter relays information over a telephone call between a BSL user and the hearing person receiving or making the call; and video remote interpreting (VRI), where a remote interpreter is used to facilitate communication with a Deaf and hearing person in the same location. Additionally, speech-to-text apps are very useful during consultations; these are widely available and many are free to download.
