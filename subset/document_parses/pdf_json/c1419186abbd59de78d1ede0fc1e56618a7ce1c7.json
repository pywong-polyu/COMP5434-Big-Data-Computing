            "text": "A cute ischemic stroke (AIS) affects someone new in the United States approximately every 40 s and is the second leading cause of death worldwide. [1] The time to revascularization has been shown to play a significant role in the recovery of symptoms; hence, time metrics for stroke have received significant attention, and management protocols have been developed to improve overall care. [1, 2] In addition to the stringent time metrics, AIS is a challenging disease to study because victims have impaired ability to understand and communicate decisions and choices about their participation in clinical trials. This makes it especially difficult to effectively and reliably conduct clinical trials to evolve our health-care systems while simultaneously employing good clinical practice. [3] When patients present to the emergency department with a large vessel occlusion (LVO), they are often unable to provide consent and are therefore excluded from emergency research participation, challenging the ethical principle of justice. Families and other legally authorized representatives (LAR) are often not at the bedside to provide consent for enrollment in clinical trials. Among other perceived benefits and harms, excluding patients may lead to study population changes with pseudovariations in demographics, resulting in a nonrepresentative or nonencompassing study cohort. Arguments have been made over the past two decades about whether an exception from informed consent (EFIC) is ethically justifiable, and if there is a need to evaluate EFIC against the actual patient's or LAR's consent decision. [4, 5] The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has issued guidance for EFIC to facilitate research on potentially life-saving interventions in emergencies, and the latest (April 2013) version of this guideline is available on the FDA's website for Institutional Review Boards (IRB). However, there remains to be no explicit criteria or a particular quantifiable goal to satisfy EFIC. A recent meta-analysis of 45 EFIC studies also suggested that a better justification and presentation of clinical research would help to educate the medical community about the ethical and scientific concerns surrounding EFIC. [6, 7] There has been further emphasis on the justification of applying EFIC with nonlife-threatening conditions and the lack of established treatment guidelines and protocols in those cases. [4] For our stroke trial, the SEGA Trial (Sedation versus General Anesthesia for Endovascular Therapy [EVT] in AIS -A Randomized Comparative Effectiveness Trial, Clinicaltrials.gov NCT-03263117), we saw the need to implement EFIC to ensure efficient and unbiased patient enrollment as well as to minimize logistic impracticability for the overall trial recruitment, since every minute counts in emergency stroke therapy. To obtain EFIC, we developed a multistep approach with the assistance of our IRB.",

Considering established stroke metrics, time from imaging to potential EVT operation as well as the time necessary to thoroughly introduce and obtain consent from an available LAR, led to the calculation of a parallel wait time of 15 min before proceeding with EFIC enrollment. When EFIC was applied, our protocol required a postoperative consent within 5 days, or before discharge, for continued study participation. All patients regardless of enrollment in the trial received standard of care treatment. Passive data acquisition was undertaken using clinical notes made during stroke hospitalization and routine institutional 3-month clinical follow-ups.",

This is a reflection of our 15 min deadline, which was determined in addition to EFIC guidelines. While we could potentially enroll most or all of the cases under EFIC in compliance with FDA and HHS regulations, we have determined to designate a window of opportunity to respect additional ethical concerns for a late-arriving LAR. This is because of the debatable lack of any therapeutic window in emergency stroke management that limits the team to perform regulatory \"reasonable efforts\" such that once a patient qualifies for EVT the treatment must be initiated immediately, since there is a very limited time window for the providers to designate it for any research purposes. [17] We have, however, achieved this while maintaining recommended door to imaging and imaging to EVT timelines and without delaying any emergency procedures with a designated research staff working in parallel to the clinical team. Hence, even with a preoperative in situ consent, we were able to meet stroke metrics for SEGA enrolled patients within the Joint Commission recommendation across all time frames: door to imaging below 25 min (mean 15, median 13), door to interventional radiology (IR) suite below 70 min (mean 54, median 47), and IR suite arrival to groin puncture below 15 min (mean 13, median 13 min).",

We have also noticed that enrollment numbers at EFIC approved centers have been less affected by logistic factors such as the inability to contact LAR inperson for an incapacitated patient or not having a research representative be on site for the after-hour code stroke cases or due to the current COVID-19 precautions in place. This increase in enrollment not only improves data validity and quality by reducing selection bias but may potentially reduce the overall study period, monitoring costs, sponsor costs, and overall time spent to conclude an emergency research trial. [4] Moreover, we did not opt for a procedure consent over the phone instead of applying EFIC due to the acuity and sensitivity of the emergent situation during an AIS with a LVO. Obtaining consent over the phone may not be the most reliable source of LAR decisions when compared to in-person consent in a professional setting. Risks of consenting the LAR by phone during a life-threatening emergency have previously been described, as the reaction of LAR to the condition alone cannot be predicted and a consequential adverse event may occur (e.g. while driving). [7] Furthermore, a phone call from a research team may feel intrusive during this sensitive and emergent period, and the details of the conversation may be overwhelming. Providing a copy of the informed consent (by fax and E-mail) is also challenging and may not be feasible in urgent cases. It is difficult to expect LARs to clearly understand an emergency procedure over the phone or respond effectively to complex medical concepts with minimal personal interaction. Hence, in cases when we were able to speak to the LAR over the phone to explain the procedure and received their approval, we still enrolled the participant under the EFIC arm, which enforced the research team to seek postoperative consent for continued participation in the trial. This step could be a matter of discussion for further EFIC trial consents.",

These resources cited Pew Research Center, one of the leading researchers on the American social and demographic trends. [8] Due to the lack of a published research comparing the effectiveness of different platforms, the reliability of these private reports may also pose a limitation. However, the consistency of these reports across different journals and companies suggest that Facebook is a preferred social media platform for reaching the adult population with stroke history. Utilizing multiple platforms may prove more effective in larger trials or to reach a broader target audience.",

However, the fact that there are individuals who feel against participating in a study that uses EFIC, despite adherence to guidelines, identifies ethical challenges regarding the concept of research without consent. We should also reiterate that the current trial involves minimal risk, which we considered a strong advantage. Acquiring a positive response and support from the community might be more challenging for more invasive or novel clinical trials, hence these campaigns may need to be carried out longer and with more resources under the adjudication of the study teams and their IRB(s).",

These in-person focus groups and community campaigns can subsequently help refine the social media campaigns. Future studies should also explore the use of multiple social media platforms and present more detailed guidance on specific cost, utility, and success measures for each method. Finally, studies should further explore and highlight the need for EFIC in research, and work to establish a universal protocol for EFIC approval that can be applied at all EFIC seeking centers.",
