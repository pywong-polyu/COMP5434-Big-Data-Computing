            "text": "Background The purpose of this study is to describe a Level 1 Trauma Center's orthopedic response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and to compare outcomes of acute fracture patients pre-COVID versus during the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods All inpatient fracture cases performed over a 5-month period were identified and retrospective chart review performed. Patients were divided into pre-and COVID-era groups based on when surgery was performed relative to March 16, 2020 (the date elective operations were ceased), and groups were statistically compared. Patients with a COVID test result were further sub-divided into COVID negative and positive groups, and statistically compared. Statistical analysis was performed using independent t-test for continuous variables and chi-square analysis for categorical variables. Results One hundred and nineteen patients were identified, 38% females with average age of 58 years. Average length of stay was 7 days with average time from injury to surgery of 3 days and average time from admission to surgery of 1.3 days. Overall in-hospital complication rate was 29.4%, and 30-day mortality and readmission rates were 2.5% and 5%, respectively. Sixty-nine patients comprised the pre-COVID group, and 50 in the COVID-era group. There was no significant difference with respect to length of stay, time from injury to surgery, time from admission to surgery, need for post-operative ICU stay, in-hospital complication rate, 30-day mortality rate and 30-day readmission rate. Thirty-four patients had COVID testing, with 24 negative and 10 positive. COVID-positive patients had longer time from injury to surgery (8.5 days vs. 2 days, p = 0.003) and longer time from admission to surgery (2.7 days vs. 1.2 days, p = 0.034). While more COVID-positive patients required ICU admission post-operatively (60% vs. 21%, p = 0.036), there was no difference in overall complication rate. Conclusions Orthopedic care of acute fracture patients was not affected by a global pandemic. The response of our Level 1 Trauma Center's orthopedic department can guide other hospitals if and when new surges in COVID cases arise, in order to prevent compromising appropriate orthopedic care.",

Additionally, the emergency ward (EW), which functions as a high-acuity monitored ward for traumas and Emergency Department (ED) visits, was converted to a respiratory COVID ICU ward. All but four of 18 operating rooms (ORs) were converted into ICU beds with negative pressure rooms (Fig. 1) . As admissions and intubations rapidly climbed, endoscopy suites and several hospital floor units were also converted into COVID-19 respiratory units and ICUs.

However, none to date have provided a quantitative analysis of surgical management of orthopedic trauma patients. This study also serves to provide the largest cohort of orthopedic trauma patients with COVID positive tests in the literature thus far. This analysis demonstrates no difference in time from injury of admission to time of surgery in orthopedic trauma patients prior to the March 16, 2020 cancelation of elective cases compared to afterward. This was in spite of a significant increase in the percentage of patients transferred from outside hospitals over the same time period. This is an important finding in light of prior literature reporting negative impacts on morbidity and mortality in both medical and surgical fields related to delays in care secondary to transfers between facilities [15] [16] [17] . In addition, there were no significant differences in rates of ICU admission postoperatively, or hospital length of stay in pre-COVID versus COVID-era groups. Overall in-hospital complication rates were 29.4%, with the majority of complications consisting of post-operative anemia requiring a blood transfusion [18] . There were no significant differences in complication rates when comparing patients pre-COVID and during COVID, including no difference in rates of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or respiratory distress.",

Although there is no prior literature to compare these results to, the difference in time from injury to surgery (8.5 days vs. 2.1 days) can likely be explained by patients' fears of presenting to the ED despite their injuries given the coronavirus pandemic. The difference in time from hospital admission to surgery was smaller (2.7 days vs. 1.2 days), and can be attributed to both the need for prolonged medical optimization given COVID + status, as well as increased efforts at non-operative management in COVID + patients given the unknown perioperative surgical risk factors of coronavirus at that time [19, 20] .",

Second, and perhaps more importantly, there is no prior literature with quantitative analysis examining the impact of COVID-19 in orthopedic trauma to compare our results to and verify our findings. Only one small study of 10 patients looked at the effect of COVID-19 in acute fracture patients, and recommended judicious use of surgical management in COVID + fracture patients [24] . However, no studies to date have investigated how, if at all, the COVID-19 pandemic affected the care of acute fracture patients regardless of COVID status. Third, we were unable to account for all orthopedic trauma patients that were evaluated and treated at our hospital, as several were managed non-operatively secondary to mortality risk and being too unstable to undergo surgery. On several occasions, patients required further medical optimization, but then decompensated, were transferred to ICU level care and died prior to orthopedic intervention, and thus were not included in our study given our methodology.",

It is our hope that the qualitative description of the mobilization of the entirety of New York City's flagship public hospital and its orthopedic department, as well as the quantitative data within this study, can be used to guide other hospitals if and when new surges in COVID cases arise, in order to prevent compromising appropriate orthopedic care. These institution-specific responses and results should be taken into consideration within the broader orthopedic community's recommendation to formulate improved action plans going forward in treating orthopedic trauma in the new COVID era [25, 26] .",
