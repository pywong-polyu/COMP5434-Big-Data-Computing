Please note the blank area on the right side in each view that can be used for written commands from the remote expert to the operator [Color figure can be viewed at wileyonlinelibrary.com]4 | DISCUSSIONTelecommunication solutions have shown to be a necessity to continue our medical practice in the context of a global pandemic with restrictions to physical interaction. Given the growing interest in and interventions for structural heart disease, proctoring has become even more relevant to maintain a high standard for (interventional) skills and patient care. Virtual reality with extended functions (e.g., augmented reality and extended reality) with graphic avatars are being developed for surgical procedures in order to improve surgical precision and medical training.4,5 In augmented reality mode, the most advantageous feature of a virtual environment is the simultaneous availability of complex data (e.g., imaging, physiology, clinical chemistry, etc.) in the physical world of the operating room. The next level of augmented reality would be the immediate adjustment of augmented data to unexpected changes during an invasive procedure, for example changes in physiological parameters or clinical chemistry during a complication.The option to record an on-line session is of great value for educational purposes. For the current proctoring sessions, it was the off-line availability of the procedures that enabled all involved to critically appraise the procedure, the operator's handling and the remote expert's instructions. Since the procedures were recorded \"through the eyes\" of the operator, it also provides an opportunity to assess off-line the frame of reference of the operator as part of the operating team.",

            "text": "especially when worn over protective goggles. In the current sessions, the maximum duration without experiencing pain by the operator at the ear region was just about 1 hr. The central and zoom camera's positions on the smartglass are not at the same place on the smartglass. Each time the remote expert wanted a zoom of the operator's view, the operator had to adjust the position of his head to find the area of interest. This results in unnecessary movements during a complex invasive procedure. The newer version of the used smartglass will have improved earpiece for wearing comfort, zoom function in the central camera (no need for additional zoom camera) and leaded protective glasses. A final device-related disadvantage is the lack of visual fixation in smartglasses while the head is moving. The remote expert's view is entirely based on the visual information passed through the camera located on the smartglass, thus every single and little movement of the operator's head is transported 1:1 to the remote expert's screen with significant motion artifacts. Humans are capable of visual fixation to maintain their visual gaze on a certain (limited) area in space, while they move their head. Future studies and innovations in soft-and hardware technology are needed to simulate fixation.It is without question that all virtual solutions are strongly depended on the quality of their (wireless) network through which they up-and download data. A well-organized ICT department with high speed (preferably ultra-high) network connections are key for a successful and enjoyable experience.5 | CONCLUSIONDuring COVID-19 and perhaps beyond, remote proctoring by means of virtual support is feasible and efficacious. The most important advantage besides adhering to physical restrictions is the off-line availability of a recorded session for critical appraisal of the procedure and proctoroperator interaction. The major limitations are the suboptimal wearing comfort, separated central and zoom camera and lack of visual fixation. A combined use of the presented technology and fixed imaging sources (Xray screen and hemodynamic monitor) could improve the interaction.",
