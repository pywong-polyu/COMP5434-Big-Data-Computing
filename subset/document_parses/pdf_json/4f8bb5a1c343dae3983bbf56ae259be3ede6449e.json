These restrictions also affect patients with severe mental illness (SMI) due to the rapid and dramatic changes that took place in the landscape of regular psychiatric health care. Public health experts and researchers have warned that the impact of the pandemic in itself, societal measures to limit the spread of disease, and changes in health care delivery may create a perfect storm of secondary adverse consequences, such as increase in suicide risk, however such an increase has not been observed in available data to date 3, 4 . Patients with SMI are a particularly vulnerable group in society 5 , and recent findings also indicate that they are more likely to contract and die from COVID-19 compared to the general population 6, 7 . Policy makers and funders now call for studies 8 that can shed light on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on vulnerable groups, and to improve knowledge on how to mitigate the negative effects of the pandemic.",

A Chinese survey on 2065 psychiatric outpatients reported that 21% of respondents experienced a deterioration of their mental health, and 22% reported a lack of access to adequate care during the pandemic 13 . Patients may also be hesitant to contact or visit their psychiatric clinic out of fear of contamination or putting an undue burden on the health care system. At the same time, they are faced with a situation of having to access and navigate care when needed via remote and digital modes 14 , a method that is not only novel but also raises the threshold of difficulty, for many in this already vulnerable group. For example, there was a 25% decrease in visits to the emergency psychiatric unit in Stockholm between March 1st and April 23rd, compared to the same dates in 2019. Taken together, these reports on possible negative impact in patients with SMI warrants research that investigates the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic on the psychiatric population.",

Interestingly, few patients (4%) reported respiratory symptoms that indicated a need for follow-up in the health care system. The findings also indicate that men, compared to women, reported fewer respiratory symptoms, were less likely to report a worsening of their psychiatric symptoms, and rated their subjective mental health as better. Furthermore, age showed no association with any of the outcomes in this study. Finally, patients at the unit for bipolar disorder responded more positively to all of the questions, likely due to follow-up within psychiatry also in stable phases. This is in contrast to the emergency unit, where patients are only seen in the acute phase of mental illness.",

An early report from the Lombardy region in Italy describes a closing of psychiatric wards and reallocation of staff towards managing patients with COVID-19 12 , which was not the case in Sweden. Although methodological differences in sampling and screening may explain differences between studies across countries, we speculate that the policies in Sweden, for example no lockdown, and sustained functionality of the specialised psychiatric care may have resulted in better access to care among individuals with severe mental illness during the early pandemic phase 16 .",

First, the study population was restricted to those patients who had not been in contact with their psychiatric clinic during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic in Sweden. The reasons for not being in touch likely varied between the patients: some may not have been in touch because they had been feeling better after receiving treatment, or were in a stable phase. However, for other patients the reason for not being in touch with their clinic could have been a direct consequence of the pandemic or the societal measures taken to reduce transmission of the virus. Second, there is no data before the pandemic to serve as a reference point. It is likely that, at any given time, some patients will report a deterioration in psychiatric symptoms, for example. Without a direct comparison it is hard to assess whether the findings indicate that the situation has gotten worse or can be viewed as relatively stable. Third, the impact of COVID-19 and the policies implemented to reduce transmission of the virus vary between countries and regions within countries, making it difficult to generalize the current findings to other contexts.",

However, existing psychiatric management plans were adequate in the majority of cases and few patients needed an early follow-up (2.5%). Men reported fewer respiratory symptoms, lower rates of deterioration in psychiatric symptoms, and better subjective mental health compared to women, and patients at the unit for bipolar disorder-typically treated in stable phases as well as during manic or depressive episodes-responded more positively to all outcomes compared to patients at other units. These findings relate to the early pandemic phase in Sweden, and continued monitoring of vulnerable groups, such as patients with severe mental illness, is needed as the pandemic continues and long-term effects can be observed. .
