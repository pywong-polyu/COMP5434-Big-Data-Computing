The prospect of the second wave of virus transmission has rendered \"E-Learning\" as an essential component in medical education. Medical education in India is currently experiencing a major transformation from \"traditional learning\" to \"blended learning,\" with e-learning playing an imminent role. 1 The implementation of the \"Competency-Based Medical Education\" (CBME) in the undergraduate medical curriculum in India has added to the existing responsibilities of medical facilitators. The COVID-19 pandemic has brought an explosive growth of e-learning, aided by the advancement in technologies. 2 Considering the faculty shortage, addressing large groups, particularly online, is a challenging task for medical instructors. This short communication is aimed at giving simple tips to make interactive e-lectures while addressing a large group of students.",
