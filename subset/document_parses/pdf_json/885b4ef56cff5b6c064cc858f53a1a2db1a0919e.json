            "text": "Caenorhabditis elegans embarks on a quiescent dauer state upon exposure to unfavourable conditions and can sustain for a very long period without food, but it returns to continuous life cycle upon arrival of suitable conditions. Thus, dauer state plays a critical role in its adaptive fitness and survival. ATP-independent endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2 has been implicated in dauer microRNA metabolism, perturbation of which causes their collapse within a very short span of time. Here, we present a detailed comparative analyses of dauer transcriptomes from a conditional mutant strain for the endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2, maintained under control and experimental conditions. We observed disruption of microRNA homeostasis in experimental dauers resulted in deregulation of a large number of mRNA targets. Our bioinformatic analyses, supported by morphological, physiological, and behavioral evidence further demonstrate critical changes in metabolism leading to a state unsupportive of dauer maintenance, alongside potential defects in multiple neuronal activities, which might have caused an overall disruption of dauer plasticity. We also explore a possible role of this endoribonuclease activity towards the maintenance of chromatin architecture and transposon expression that in turn might affect the transcriptional program critically required for the maintenance of non-aging, long-lived dauers. Finally, we also demonstrate that perturbation of the endoribonuclease activity during the dauer state exerts drastic adverse effects on the continuity of life cycle after dauer-exit. They not only fail to recapitulate the wild type events of germline development and embryogenesis, but also present traits of very old worms and formation of 'tumor-like' structures in the proximal gonad.",

Comparatively high C. elegansspecific pheromone 2,5 concentrations due to overpopulation, with respect to available 'food signals', promote dauer arrest, which further gets facilitated by high temperature. Under dauer inducing conditions, the worm first enters a 'pre-dauer preparatory state', L2D larva, where it senses the environmental cues through specific neurons of the nervous system and thereafter relay, process and integrate those information through dauer formation (daf) gene network that govern the dauer vs continuous life cycle (progression to L3 stage) developmental decision. Genetic analyses of dauer mutants have identified four distinct pathways that are involved in the regulation of dauer arrest. These pathways (Guanylyl cyclase 2,6,7 , TGF-\u03b2 -like 2,8,9 , Insulin-like 2,10,11 , Steroid hormone pathways 12-16 ) are organized in multiple layers, operate in distinct sensory and neuroendocrine tissues and form a cascade that converge on DAF-9 13,14 , a cytochrome P450 steroid monooxygenase (3-keto-sterol-26monooxygenase). DAF-9 executes the last catalytic step in the synthesis of a cholesterolderived hormone in the hypodermis, somatic gonad and XXX cells, which can diffuse to most tissues to bind to the widely expressed nuclear hormone receptor DAF-12, and that in turn promotes reproductive development of the continuous life cycle 12,15,16 . In the absence of the hormone, DAF-12 promotes a transcriptional program towards dauer formation. A quiescent dauer worm suspends cell division, differentiation, and it is long-living as well as non-aging.",

Interestingly, this endoribonuclease activity was shown to be more efficacious than the previously known exoribonuclease activity, in vitro. Thus, it was proposed that such an ATP-independent endoribonucleolytic mode of miRNA turnover mechanism may be relevant in energy-deprived dauer worms 23 , where many miRNAs are known to be present at much lower levels compared to that of the equivalent continuous life cycle stages. Indeed, in a later study, it was found that this ATP-independent endoribonuclease activity acts on miRNAs in energy-deprived quiescent dauer worms, and its perturbation severely affects miRNA homeostasis that in turn affects the target mRNAs, and culminates in their fall 24 .",

Although, those results were clear enough to demonstrate the role of the newly identified endoribonuclease activity in miRNA metabolism and its importance towards the maintenance of dauer stage, but it did not present a comprehensive global picture of the transcriptome indicating how the different pathways might have got affected and led to the disruption of the dauer regulatory plasticity to the extent that they collapsed within ten days.

Also, for the ~5.7% of the downregulated miRNAs, we observed increase in the levels of their cognate targets accounting to ~11.3% of the detected transcripts 25 (Fig. 1D, E) . Together, this inverse relationship between the differentially expressed miRNAs and their cognate targets further suggested that to a reasonably large extent the effect of depletion of the endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2 on the dauer transcriptome is indeed due to its role as a 'miRNase', where biogenesis of the downregulated miRNAs could have been adversely affected due to depletion of transcription factors, whose mRNAs got downregulated by the accumulated miRNAs.

            "text": "In C. elegans, an important function of PEPCK is to drive out resources from the gluconeogenesis pathway by converting PEP into oxaloacetate. This leads to the formation of fumarate, via malate, to act as an electron acceptor in anaerobic mitochondria 31, 35 . Reduction of fumarate involves electron transfer from mitochondrial complex II to fumarate, via the electron carrier rhodoquinone (RQ) and fumarate reductase (i.e.; succinate dehydrogenase working in the opposite direction 35, 36 . It becomes possible as RQ has much lower reduction potential compared to ubiquinone (Coenzyme Q) that is integral to the succinate dehydrogenase activity driving succinate to fumarate. In another wing of this pathway, malate also gets converted into acetate through pyruvate and forms NADH, which in turn balances the formation of NAD from NADH during the synthesis of succinate from fumarate, and thus contributes to the maintenance of cellular redox balance in the absence of oxygen. Fumarate reductase (F48E8.3) catalyses the conversion of fumarate to succinate, and in dauers this gene is known to get upregulated compared to continuous life cycle worms 30,34 . Importantly, it has been reported that the chain of reactions from PEPCK-to-succinate are critical for dauers, and thus the concerned activities get upregulated. Here, an important postulate states that anaerobic respiration involving fumarate might lower production of damaging reactive oxygen species, thereby contributing to the longevity of dauers 37 . Acetate:succinate CoAtransferase is also involved in anaerobic generation of acetate, which shows upregulation in dauer worms. Experimental dauers showed downregulation of Fumarate reductase as well as Acetate:succinate CoA-transferase ( Fig. 2A) . This would have also reduced or excluded PEP from getting channelized into the fermentation pathways and thus in turn would have deprived the experimental dauers from some important sources of energy. Notably, Fumarate reductase is a predicted target of mir-70 and mir-253 and both were found to be accumulated in the experimental dauers ( Fig. 2A) .",

Peroxisomes also catabolize most of the less common fatty acids, including dicarboxylic acids, prostaglandins, leukotrienes and xenobiotic fatty acids 17,31,38 . Proteins involved in peroxisomal lipid catabolism include very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetases, ABC transporters (homologues of the adrenoleukodystrophy protein, ADLP), and peroxisomal thiolases. In dauer worms, majority of these genes show upregulation 39 . Moreover, peroxin genes that are involved in peroxisome assembly 38,39 , division and inheritance are also upregulated in dauer worms, which essentially suggest an elevated peroxisomal activity in dauers. Contrastingly, experimental dauers showed downregulation of all peroxin genes as well as majority of the very long-chain fatty acid transporters (pmp-1, pmp-2, pmp-3) and very long-chain fatty acid catabolism genes ( Fig. 2A) . Thus, these data suggested that experimental dauers might have suffered a compromised peroxisomal fatty acid metabolism.",

The stained fat granules in the control dauers depicted very little change in their overall fat content from day one to day five (~110 hrs, Fig. 2C and data not shown). But, in the experimental dauers, the fat content dramatically depleted between end of day two and end of day three, and further declined on day four. However, the time point (~110 hrs, day five) at which samples were collected for RNA extraction and analyses didn't show any significant decline in fat content from the earlier day. It is possible that fat was highly utilized between day two and day four to upregulate the expression of genes necessary for energy metabolism through TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation, and other necessary changes required for dauer-exit and post-dauer life (see next section). And, probably, from day four onwards there was a slow-down of energy production through fat breakdown and \u03b2-oxidation as the fat content stopped declining like the previous two days. Except one caveat described below, the mRNA expression pattern of the experimental dauers corroborated with this observation, where they showed downregulation of the genes required for dauer-specific energy metabolism and upregulation of the players involved in the energy metabolism during postdauer stages. lipl-5 mRNA coding for the major fat breakdown lipase, whose expression gets stimulated upon starvation 40 , was found to be upregulated in the experimental dauers, however, this could be due to a feedback response elicited upon downregulation of \u03b2oxidation pathway components and subsequent reduction in energy production. It could be possible that with reduced energy pool those upregulated lipl-5 mRNAs were not translated and thus might not have contributed to breakdown of stored fat at the given timepoint. evidence supports the existence of additional DAF-2 outputs that function in parallel to AGE-1-mediated pathway 46 . Mutations that activate akt-1 can suppress dauer arrest in age-1 null mutants, but they are unable to suppress dauer formation in daf-2(e1370) mutants efficiently.",

Moreover, expression level of daf-14 mRNA was also down, as it has a predicted site for mir-77 that showed upregulation. Accordingly, it was very likely that the TGF-\u03b2 signaling pathway, promoting growth was not active in the experimental dauers, rather they might have been transducing alternative signals to maintain dauer state through the same pathway. Interestingly, the level of daf-3 mRNA also got diminished. Expression of two genes, scd-1 and scd-2, which are thought to promote the function of DAF-3 and DAF-5 were diminished, and they are predicted to have target sites for lin-4 that showed heavy accumulation. Thus, although, the TGF-\u03b2 signaling was probably down in the experimental dauers, but it is possible that the active DAF-3/DAF-5 complex also got accumulated sub-optimally, and that might have failed to signal the worms to (Fig. 3D) . GO Term Enrichment analyses 26 of those upregulated transcripts reveled that they are involved in the reproductive growth of the organism, which otherwise must remain repressed during the dauer stage (Fig. 3E) . These revelations supported the notion that indeed in the experimental dauers, DAF-12/DA complex was active and resulted in an altered transcriptional program that was unsupportive of dauer maintenance. In support of the above arguments, we indeed observed gradual loss of mouth plug and redevelopment of pharyngeal structures in the experimental dauers, which were indicative of their preparation for devouring food and resuming the activities of continuous life cycle (Fig. 3F, G) . To understand how downregulation of the aforementioned pan-neuronal, terminal selector and effector genes in the experimental dauers affected their behavior/ response to altered environmental conditions, we introduced control and experimental dauers at a given edge of petri plates and placed food (OP50) on the diametrically opposite ends of those plates.",

Now, critical pathways involved in dauer maintenance did fail in the experimental dauers upon perturbation of the endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2 ( Fig. 3A-C) . Additionally, stress chaperones such as hsp-12.6, hsp-60 (members of hsp-12.6 alpha-crystallin family) as well as ROS-response genes such as sod-5, ctl-1, ctl-2, ctl-3 etc. also got downregulated in the experimental dauers ( Fig. 3B, C) , indicating that they might have lost their ability to sustain in a stressed condition. Moreover, genes involved in the catabolism of xenobiotic compounds were also downregulated in the experimental dauers, and a similar situation in the parasitic nematodes is likely to have made them more susceptible to drugs (Fig. 3B, C) . Therefore, the roles played by the endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2 in the infective lifecycle stages of parasitic nematodes need to be explored. Given the fact that there might be a species-specific positively charged RNA binding patch (PCP) critical for the endoribonucleolytic mechanism of XRN-2 24 , it holds potential for designing of effective drugs targeting parasitic nematodes affecting not only humans, but livestock and plants as well, and thus of relevance to animal husbandry industry and agriculture.",

Dry cough and changes in lung interstitium are also caused by increased TGF-\u03b2 by means of activating fibroblast growth factors (FGFs). High TGF-\u03b2 also promotes heavy secretion by bronchial mucus cells that hinders normal breathing, and can lead to serious infections and shock. Additionally, TGF-\u03b2 is a strong immunosuppressive factor in the body, inhibits proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes, and thus suppresses immune function and causes delay in recovery. TGF-\u03b2 negatively impacts olfactory and gustatory receptor neurons and neurogenesis by inhibiting progenitor cell proliferation and differentiation, and its deregulation gets manifested in the loss of olfactory and gustatory senses in some patients 117, 118 . Overall, the clinical manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 are highly consistent with increased TGF-\u03b2 activity, which is thought to be one of the main reasons for occurrence of cytokine storms. Here, in the experimental dauers, we have reported downregulation of mRNAs coding for DAF-7 (TGF\u03b2) and one of its receptor subunits (DAF-4), as a likely consequence of heavy accumulation of targeting miRNAs (Fig. 3A) . Moreover, ILC-17.1 (IL-17) as well as its receptor got downregulated at the mRNA levels in the experimental dauers, potentially for the same reason (Fig. 5A) . Elevated IL-17 levels have already been reported to facilitate cytokine storms and have been linked with viral load and disease severity. Interestingly, elevated IL-17 levels were also previously described in patients with MERS-CoV 119 , and thus appears to be a common pathological signature in patients infected with this particular family of viruses.",

Dauer pheromone, a complex mixture of ascarosides, is continuously secreted by C. elegans, and high concentrations potently induce dauer formation 5 . Several chemosensory 7TM GPCRs, including SRBC-64 and SRBC-66, SRG-36 and SRG-37, DAF-37 and DAF-38, sense specific or combinations of dauer-inducing ascarosides 41-44 . These chemosensory GPCRs signal through their G \u03b1 subunits, GPA-2 and GPA-3 6,41 . When dauer pheromone levels are high, GPA-2 and GPA-3 inhibit the transmembrane guanylyl cyclase encoded by daf-11, thereby decreasing concentrations of the second messenger, cGMP 7 . Constitutively activated forms of GPA-2 or GPA-3, as well as loss of function mutations in daf-11, result in dauer constitutive (Daf-c) phenotypes, while mutations that inactivate GPA-2 or GPA-3 result in decreased dauer entry, even under dauer-inducing conditions. In our experimental dauers, genes involved in the biosynthesis of ascarosides 41 (daf-22, acox-1, dhs-1 and maoc-1) as well as genes required for the perception of dauer-inducing pheromone 5,43 (daf-37, daf-38, gpa-2 and gpa-3) got downregulated(Fig. 3A). This downregulation was likely to promote the function of DAF-11 7,9,11,45 , leading to a greater production of cGMP, which in turn would have promoted reproductive growth through activating TGF-\u03b2 and insulin/IGF-like signaling (IIS). But daf-11 mRNA was also heavily downregulated in the experimental dauers(Fig. 3A). Therefore, despite having impaired dauer-inducing pheromone perception, the experimental dauers might have failed to produce high concentration of cGMP that is required for reproductive growth.Depending on upstream events that integrate and convey environmental cues, IIS transduces signals through a combination of finely regulated cascade of interactions 46 . During replete conditions, IIS leads to normal development and adult lifespan. Insulin-like peptides (INS-4, INS-7, DAF-28) bind and activate insulin-like receptor, DAF-2 10,11,29,46 , which in turn activates AGE-1/PI3K to increase the level of PIP 3 , whose formation is antagonistically balanced by DAF-18/PTEN phosphatase by promoting the conversion of PIP 3 to PIP 2 47 . PIP 3 further activates two downstream kinases, PDK-1 and AKT-1, which in turn, phosphorylates and inactivates DAF-16/FOXO transcription factor 46,48 , by promoting its retention to cytosol with the help of FTT-2/14-3-3 proteins. Conversely, during unfavorable conditions, IIS is downregulated, allowing nuclear translocation of DAF-16/FOXO, where it turns on the expression of genes for stress resistance, dauer formation, and longevity. Notably, genetic",

But, these set of events probably got counteracted by upregulation of daf-18 mRNA as DAF-18 counters activation of PDK-1/ AKT-1 by promoting the conversion of PIP 3 to PIP 2 . Moreover, akt-1 mRNA, which is predicted to have mir-241 target site, also got downregulated. daf-16 mRNA, which is predicted to be targeted by let-7 family of miRNAs, also showed 60% (p value = 0.03) downregulation. Therefore, it is possible that the effective protein concentrations of AKT-1 and DAF-16 must have determined the extent of phosphorylation and cytoplasmic retention of DAF-16. DAF-2, which showed a 2.0 folds upregulation at the level of mRNA, might also have influenced the activity of DAF-16 negatively in an AKT-independent manner (Fig. 3A). Therefore, to obtain clarity on DAF-16 functionality, we checked the mRNA levels of the genes that are known to be directly or indirectly targeted by DAF-16 48,49 .Amongst the DAF-16 targets that were identified from mixed stage worms, 160 got downregulated in the experimental dauers(Fig. 3B). GO Term Enrichment analyses 26 of those downregulated genes showed that they are indeed involved in dauer formation and longevity regulating pathways(Fig. 3C). This data suggested that either the concentration of DAF-16 was too low to maintain the expression of its target genes or upregulated DAF-2 via AKT-1-dependent and/or independent pathway phosphorylated majority of the available DAF-16 molecules that led to the cytoplasmic retention of DAF-16. Thus, despite food being unavailable, experimental dauers exhibited diminished DAF-16-mediated transcriptional program indispensable for dauer maintenance.The TGF-\u03b2-like pathway that regulates dauer arrest is defined by the Daf-c genes daf-1,4,7,8, 14  and the Daf-d genes daf-3, daf-5 50 . During replete condition, high level of secreted TGF-\u03b2 family ligand DAF-7 51 binds to and activates heteromeric cell surface receptors DAF-1 52 and DAF-4 53 that possess serine/threonine kinase activity, which results in the phosphorylation and activation of SMAD transcription factors DAF-8 8,43,54 and DAF-14 8 . Activated DAF-8/DAF-14 complex antagonizes a complex of DAF-3/SMAD and DAF-5/SNO-SKI, which might be occurring either in the cytoplasm or nucleus, and thereby promote energy utilization and reproductive growth 50,55 . During unfavorable conditions, reduced or absent DAF-7/TGF-\u03b2 signaling permits the DAF-3/DAF-5 complex to augment dauer specific transcriptional program facilitating energy storage, and other survival traits.",

EXP-2 in turn negatively regulates the secretion of agonistic insulin-like peptide DAF-2854 . Although, daf-14 mRNA level was low in the experimental dauers, level of exp-2 mRNA was also much diminished and it has a predicted target site for mir-75 that showed massive accumulation, and that in turn probably incapacitated EXP-2 to exert its inhibitory effect on DAF-28. Together, these results suggested that despite having less TGF-\u03b2 signaling, the miRNA-mediated changes in the levels of some specific components might have facilitated activation of the IIS pathway to promote reproductive growth in experimental dauers.During favorable conditions, when population density is low DAF-12 is governed by steroidhormones called dafachronic acid (DA) 13-16 . Cytochrome P450 enzyme DAF-9 catalyzes the last step of this hormone synthesis process 13-16 . DAF-12 acts as a developmental switch. In its DA-bound state, it promotes reproductive development, whereas in the DA-free state, it binds to DIN-1 and induces dauer formation 56 . Experimental dauers showed upregulation of mRNA levels of genes involved in the biosynthesis of DA such as DAF-9, DHS-16, suggesting that the production of DA might have been high. This presented the possibility that all the DAF-12 molecules might have been in association with DA in the experimental dauers and that in turn might have swung the decision in favour of reproductive growth. Additionally, mRNA level of lin-42, whose protein product blocks the DAF-12/DIN-1 complex 57 was also dramatically high in the experimental worms, suggesting that the experimental dauers might have promoted reproductive growth by producing high amount of DA as well as by blocking DAF-12/DIN-1 complex. Notably, we also observed that the level of daf-12 mRNA was significantly diminished in the experimental dauers. Intriguingly, DA liganded DAF-12 promote the expression of let-7 family of miRNAs, which in turn negatively regulate daf-12 mRNA, and thus form a negative feedback loop 20,21 . Since, let-7 family of miRNAs (let-7s) indeed showed dramatic upregulation in the experimental worms (Fig. 1B, C), due to compromised XRN-2-mediated turnover as well as DAF-12/DA mediated transcriptional activation, they might have contributed to the downregulation of DAF-12. To better understand how DAF-12 influenced the transcriptome of the experimental dauers, we checked the expression levels of DAF-12 target genes 58 . Amongst those targets, 423 were upregulated, and 245 showed downregulation",

            "text": "In C. elegans, majority of the neurons are generated during embryogenesis by a series of asymmetric cell divisions oriented along the anteroposterior axis 59,60 . Following each asymmetric division, the POP-1(Wnt)/SYS-1(\u03b2-catenin) asymmetry pathway cooperates with transcription factors (TFs) inherited from the mother cells, as well as transiently expressed TFs in some cases in the new-born precursor-neuroblast/ neuron, and collectively activate the expression of different transcription factors in the anterior and posterior daughter cells leading to the development of distinctly different neuronal cell fates 59,60 . Combinatorial developmental inputs (lineage specific TFs and the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin asymmetry pathway) eventually initiate the expression of a unique set of TFs (terminal selectors) in each of the neuron types that leads to the expression of effector proteins necessary for the functional features/ identity of a mature neuron type, such as neurotransmitter receptors, neurotransmitter synthesizing enzymes, neuropeptides, ion channels, sensory receptors, synaptic recognition molecules etc 59-64 . These terminal selectors frequently autoregulate their expression, and they not only activate a large battery of type specific terminal differentiation genes, but also contribute to the maintenance of terminal differentiation programs in mature neuron types throughout the life of the animal. Notably, there are also pan-neuronal genes expressed in all neuron types throughout the nervous system 64 .Dauer larvae show distinct behavioural patterns as compared to continuous life cycle worms and have altered motifs of chemosensory receptor expression 45,65 . Results presented in the previous sections suggested that the experimental dauers showed signatures of continuous life cycle despite residing in a famished environment, and that could have resulted from an incorrect assessment of the environment due to malfunctioning of the nervous system. Therefore, we were intrigued to understand whether the experimental dauers were executing the proper expression patterns of terminal selector genes, as well as pan-neuronal genes, indispensable for the proper functioning of the different neurons.C. elegans hermaphrodites possess 302 neurons. White et al. 66 , employing highly sophisticated electron microscopic studies, accurately identified 118 classes of neurons based on their cell body positions, axodendritic features, synaptic junctions/ connectivities etc. Here, for simplicity and brevity, we aim to present how the different terminal selector gene expression patterns are affected in the experimental dauers based on the broad functional categorization of the neurons that identify them as: sensory neurons, inter-neurons and motorneurons. Lastly, we also demonstrate the changes in the expression of genes in the experimental dauers linked to their neurotransmitter biogenesis. Sensory neurons. C. elegans has a powerful chemosensory apparatus that perceives chemicals in the environment, including food, noxious elements, volatile compounds, gases, mating signals, and is mediated by multiple chemosensory neurons including AWA, AWB, AWC, ASI, ASE, ASG etc 65 . Correct development/ differentiation of these neurons is essential for proper functioning of C. elegans sensory mechanisms. Three transcription factors namely MLS-2, CEH-36, and SOX-2 are required for AWC neuronal identity, whereas LIN-11 promotes AWA neuronal fate by inducing the expression of ODR-7, and LIM-4 along with SOX-2 controls the AWB neuronal fate 59-63,65 . Expression of mls-2, ceh-36, odr-7 and lim-4 mRNAs got downregulated in the experimental dauers (the last two candidates are predicted to host mir-80 target sites). Consequently, we observed that the direct targets (identity genes) of these terminal selectors were also downregulated in the same samples. Notably, some of these identity genes such as odr-3, expressed in both AWB and AWC neurons, have predicted target sites for mir-77 and mir-80 that were upregulated in the experimental dauers. Overall, the data suggested that the terminal selector genes as well as their targets involved in the maintenance of the differentiated state of AWA, AWB and AWC olfactory neurons, were downregulated in the experimental dauers (Fig. 4A). Zinc finger TF, CHE-1, along with CEH-36 drives the fate and chemotaxis properties of the ASE neurons, whereas UNC-30 plays a key role in the functionality of ASG neurons 59-63,65 . UNC-3, a member of the Collier/Olf1/EBF (COE) TF family, induces the effector genes required for the maintenance of ASI neuron fate and functionality 59,61,62 . Experimental dauers showed downregulation of che-1 and ceh-36 mRNAs, which might have resulted in impaired differentiation and functioning of ASE neurons. Experimental dauers also showed downregulation of unc-3 (predicted to have target site for mir-80) and unc-30 mRNAs (predicted to have target sites for mir-70 and mir-75), required for the proper development and differentiation of ASI and ASG neurons, respectively (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, unc-30 also plays an important role in early neuronal lineage decisions as well 60 . Thus, there is a possibility that miRNA-mediated regulation of unc-30 plays a critical role in the establishment of neuronal lineages, alongside playing important roles in the late events like terminal selection and maintenance of the differentiated state. Additionally, C. elegans uses chemosensory neurons such as URX, AQR, and PQR to detect changes in O 2 and CO 2 levels, thereby protecting themselves from hypoxia or hyperoxia 65 . The fates of URX, AQR, and PQR are determined by the TF, AHR-1, which in turn gets regulated by UNC-86 59-63,65 . unc-86 mRNA was downregulated in experimental dauers, and it hosts predicted target sites for mir-80 and mir-77, which corroboratively showed upregulation in the same samples. Notably, expression of ahr-1 mRNA displayed downregulation, and that in turn probably resulted in the downregulation of expression of most of its target genes, including gcy-33, gcy-35, gcy-36, gcy-37 etc, which are essential for gas sensation. Moreover, some of these effector genes namely gcy-35 and gcy-36 have predicted target sites for mir-70 that was upregulated (Fig. 4B). Thus, experimental dauers might have failed to express key terminal selector genes as well as effector genes required for proper differentiation/development of neurons involved in gas sensation. MEC-3, a LIM-homeobox TF, plays a critical role in the terminal differentiation of mechanosensory neurons such as AVM, ALMs, PVM, PLMs, FLPs, and PVDs and is required for touch response behaviour 59-63,67 . TFs, UNC-86 and LIN-32 are the major developmental regulators of MEC-3-expressing neurons. Both factors are required for the development of the precursor lineage as well as terminal differentiation and maintenance of sensory touch neurons, and likely regulate mec-3 mRNA expression indirectly. In experimental dauers, both unc-86 (hosts predicted target sites for mir-80 and mir-77) and mec-3 (hosts predicted target site for mir-80) got downregulated, which in turn probably led to the downregulation of downstream effector genes. Moreover, expression of unc-42 (predicted to host target sites for mir-70 and mir-75) and vab-3 mRNAs, which are required for the functionality of two other mechanosensory neurons namely ASH and OLL, URY, respectively, got downregulated in the experimental dauers (Fig. 4C). Overall, our data suggested that genes involved in the maintenance of differentiated states of multiple neurons involved in different sensory perceptions of the worms were downregulated in experimental dauers, which might have failed them to perceive their environment correctly. Interneurons. After receiving environmental signals, sensory neurons relay them to the interneurons, where all the information gets processed and integrated and then transferred to downstream neurons to induce the appropriate behavioral responses. Interneurons form the main information processing/ decision-making center connecting sensory action with behavioral output. The AIY interneurons receive and integrate information from several amphid sensory neurons, including AWA, AWB, AFD, and ASE, and are involved in locomotion, thermotaxis and chemotaxis 63,68 . A complex comprising TTX-3 [LIM homeobox 9 (LHX9) ortholog], and CEH-10 [human visual system homeobox 2 (VSX2) ortholog] along with CEH-23 control AIY neuron terminal differentiation 59-63 . These candidates are involved in an induction cascade as depicted in Fig. 4D. In experimental dauers, expression of ttx-3 and ceh-10 mRNAs got downregulated, which might have led to compromised AIY functioning. The AIZ interneurons are involved in the odorant sensing pathway and receive signals from the AWA and AWC chemosensory neurons. UNC-86 induces AIZ generation during embryogenesis and is required to maintain AIZ function throughout life 59-63 . As mentioned earlier, unc-86 mRNA got downregulated in experimental dauers suggesting that AIZ neuronal maintenance might got compromised, which in turn might have resulted in defective odor-attraction and odor-adaptation behavior in them. UNC-42 plays a role in the terminal differentiation of AVD neurons, and along with FAX-1, it plays a critical role in the fate determination and axonal guidance of AVA and AVE interneurons that control backward locomotion 68,69 . Both unc-42 (predicted to have target site for mir-80) and fax-1 mRNAs got downregulated in the experimental dauers and that might have caused compromise in AVA, AVD, and AVE neuronal identities (Fig. 4D). Moreover, fate/ identity of ALA interneurons, which regulate a sleep-like behavior known as lethargus quiescence is determined by two homeodomain TFs, CEH-14, and CEH-17 70,71 . che-14 and che-17 mRNAs are predicted to have target sites for let-7 family members and mir-80, respectively, and displayed downregulation in the experimental dauers, which might have resulted in an improper development of ALA interneurons. Taken together the above results suggested that terminal development and functionality of multiple interneurons might have been compromised in the experimental dauers. Motor neurons. Motor neurons, through the release of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides, regulate behavior-specific movements. The output of the motor neurons can be sex-specific, such that males generate mating-specific movements 63 . They can control rhythmic behaviors such as egg-laying, which is facilitated by HSN 63,72 (hermaphrodite-specific neuron). Along with correct fate implementation, obtainment of appropriate synaptic patterns are key for securing motor neuron diversity and function 59 . Fate of SMB motor neuron, which influences 'local search behavior', is determined by LIM-4 73 . lim-4 mRNA has predicted target site for mir-80 and got downregulated in experimental dauers (Fig. 4E). UNC-3 controls fate determination and synaptogenesis of multiple ventral nerve cord motor neurons including SAB motor neurons, which potentially controls head and neck movements 74 . UNC-3 along with PAG-3 also regulates VA and VB identity, which control backward and forward movements, respectively 74 . In experimental dauers, unc-3 mRNA was downregulated and it has predicted target site for mir-80. Lack of UNC-3 in VA and VB neurons might have led to the development of an alternative VC fate in them, and that in turn might have caused defective locomotion in the experimental dauers 74 . Moreover, UNC-4 which controls the synaptic patterns in VA and VB motor neurons 74 , also got downregulated at mRNA level in the experimental dauers, which might have resulted in the generation of defective/ underdeveloped synapses with interneurons. Specific ventral and dorsal motor neurons (VD and DD motor neurons) are also involved in locomotion. The distinct synaptic patterns of these neurons are mediated by UNC-55, a nuclear hormone receptor. UNC-55 facilitates synapse formation between the VD motor neurons 75 and the DA and DB motor neurons. unc-55 mRNA also showed downregulation in the experimental dauers (Fig. 4E), which might have led to the formation of faulty synaptic patterns leading to defective locomotion in the experimental dauers. Finally, HSN motor neurons can control egg-laying through G protein-coupled receptormediated regulation of vulval muscle contraction 72,76 . UNC-86, HLH-3, EGL-18, AST-1, CEH-20, SEM-4 and EGL-46 collectively control terminal differentiation and function of HSN neurons 59,61-63,72,76 . Together, these TFs induce and maintain HSN-expressed genes, including tph-1 and cat-1, where UNC-86 acts as the master regulator for most of the other TFs. Expression of unc-86, hlh-3, ast-1 and ceh-20 mRNAs got downregulated in the experimental dauers. hlh-3 and ceh-20 are predicted to have target sites for mir-80, whereas ast-1 mRNA hosts predicted target sites for members of let-7 family, mir-75, mir-80. unc-86mRNA is also predicted to have target sites for mir-77 and mir-80, and all these miRNAs were upregulated in experimental dauers(Fig. 4E). Interestingly, we observed egg-laying defect in these experimental worms upon dauer-exit (data not shown). Thus, upregulation ofonly a handful of miRNAs in the experimental dauers might have led to the downregulation of expression of some of the most important key regulator genes implicated in proper development and differentiation of neurons. Notably, we also noticed that expression of several pan-neuronal genes such as ric-4, snt-1, egl-3 (possesses predicted target site for mir-36), rgef-1 (possesses predicted target sites for mir-71, -75, -80), unc-104 (possesses predicted target sites for mir-71, -75, -80), egl-21 (possesses predicted target site for mir-80) and unc-10 (possesses predicted target sites for mir-71, -80) got downregulated in the experimental dauers, and collectively they must have affected the overall functional efficiency of the nervous system 64 .",

            "text": "). Neurotransmitter biogenesis. Multiple genes involved in different neurotransmitter biogenesis showed altered expression levels in the experimental dauers. GABA is synthesized from the amino acid glutamic acid by the enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), encoded by unc-25 77 . Expression of unc-25 mRNA is dependent on the transcription factor unc-30, which is predicted to have target sites for mir-70 and mir-75. unc-30 mRNA got downregulated in the experimental dauers, and that in turn probably led to the reduced expression of unc-25 mRNA (Fig. 4I). Acetylcholine (ACh) is synthesized from choline by the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, CHA-1 78 . cha-1 mRNA is predicted to have target sites for mir-75 and mir-80 and was downregulated in the experimental dauers (Fig. 4I).For dopamine biosynthesis, tyrosine is first hydroxylated by tyrosine hydroxylase (CAT-2) to produce L-Dopa, and for 5-HT/ Serotonin synthesis, tryptophan is hydroxylated by tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH-1) to produce 5-hydroxytryptophan 79 . After their generation by CAT-2 and TPH-1, both L-Dopa and 5-hydroxytryptophan are then decarboxylated by the same aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD), encoded by bas-1, to produce dopamine and serotonin, respectively 79 . Whereas, octopamine biosynthesis depends on tyrosine decarboxylase (TDC-1), which converts tyrosine into tyramine. Then tyramine is converted to octopamine by tyramine \u03b2-hydroxylase 79 . Both cat-2 and tph-1 mRNAs got downregulated in the experimental dauers(Fig. 4I), suggesting a possible compromise in the production of both dopamine and serotonin. Interestingly, mRNA levels of both octopamine biosynthetic enzymes showed upregulation in the experimental dauers. In the next section, we will discussthe downregulation of the octopamine receptor (OCTR-1) at the level of its transcript. Thus, it is possible that increase in the mRNA levels of octopamine biosynthesis components might have happened because of feedback response for downregulated octr-1 expression. Lastly, glial cells are known to be important for the homeostasis of the mammalian differentiated neurons and recovery of post-injury neuronal tissue, and thus for better understanding of the subject, worm glial cells are also actively investigated 80,81 . CEPsh glial cells in worms have been shown to modulate dopamine-dependent behaviors, including feeding and other learning behaviors 81 . Disruption of the hlh-17 gene led to changes in egglaying behavior, feeding behavior-plasticity deficits, and an impaired form of gustatory associative learning 81 . The four CEPsh glial cells present in worms are closely associated with the four CEP neurons, which facilitate the aforementioned behaviors through release and up-take of dopamine. Developing CEPsh glia are known to specifically express HLH-17, an ortholog of the TF, OLIG2, which is required for oligodendrocyte specification 80 . In the developing spinal cord of vertebrates, oligodendrocytes form distinct ventral and dorsal domains, where Olig2 expression is induced in the ventral region by the TFs, Nkx6 and Pax6. Interestingly, CEPsh expression of hlh-17 also requires the Nkx-like mls-2 and Pax-like vab-3 80 (mir-235, mir-249, mir-63s, and mir-231, mir-787, mir-236, mir-50s are predicted to target mls-2 and vab-3 mRNAs, respectively). Now, all these three genes showed dramatic downregulation in the experimental dauers (data not presented), and might have affected them adversely. Of note, we did not observe any changes in the levels of the miRNAs potentially targeting those downregulated candidates. Thus, it would be necessary to perform an in-depth systematic study to understand the role of XRN-2-mediated regulation of miRNAs in worm glial cells, if any, and how that affects the modulatory role they play on other neurons.Immune system components of the experimental dauers exhibit altered expression patternsThe worm innate immune system provides the first line of defence against pathogenic infections and relies upon pathways that are conserved across phyla. It is known that the worm nervous system elicits and regulates the innate immune response upon exposure to pathogens, and neuronal GPCRs play critical roles in inducing and governing several key downstream pathways that mount the immune response 82,83 . Since, in the earlier section, it could be noted that neuronal development and functions potentially get shaped by miRNAs, which in turn get regulated by the endoribonuclease activity of XRN-2, we were intrigued to understand the overall changes in the expression of the components of the immune system that might have occurred in the experimental dauers.In C. elegans, evolutionarily conserved p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase cassette comprising PMK-1, NSY-1, SEK-1, TIR-1 plays a central role in immune response, where PMK-1 84,85 is the most well studied effector protein (p38 MAPK PMK-1). This pathway governs the infection-induced expression of secreted immune response gene products, including C-type lectins, lysozymes, and antimicrobial peptides that are known to fight off infection in many species. However, host innate immune responses need to be tightly regulated because insufficient response may exacerbate infection, whereas excessive response may result in prolonged inflammation, which might lead to tissue damage and death. Therefore, multiple pathways exist that under normal conditions suppress the unwanted activation of p38 MAPK pathway, and thereby protect the organism from unwarranted activation of innate immune effectors. C. elegans operates multiple immuno-suppressive pathways mediated by receptors OCTR-1 83 , OLRN-1 82 and dopamine-DOP-4 86 . Neurotransmitter octopamine (OA) released from RIC interneurons, acts as a ligand for OCTR-1 that functions in the sensory ASH neurons, which leads to the suppression of innate immune response in pharyngeal and intestinal tissues 83 . Ligand activated OCTR-1 suppresses the expression of non-canonical unfolded protein response (UPR) genes of the pqn/abu family, as well as genes in the immune pathway mediated by p38 MAPK PMK-1. Notably, OA is the invertebrate counterpart of the vertebrate neurotransmitter norepinephrine. The OA receptor, OCTR-1, is orthologous to the alpha-2A adrenergic receptor of norepinephrine. Since, norepinephrine regulates innate immune responses in mammals and other vertebrates, the immunomodulatory functions of OA/norepinephrine are thought to be conserved. Sympathetic noradrenergic neurons, especially splenic nerve, function in the mammalian inflammatory reflex to suppress infection-induced production of inflammatory cytokines in the spleen and other organs. Thus, this immune-inhibitory neural circuit plays a critical role in maintaining optimal immunogenic response. Although, genes involved in the biogenesis of OA got dramatically upregulated in the experimental dauers, octr-1 mRNA (predicted to have target site for mir-75) expression was downregulated. Consequently, it could be noted that the mRNAs of non-canonical UPR genes of the pqn/abu family and effector genes of the p38 MAPK PMK-1 immune pathway also got dramatically upregulated (Fig. 5A), and that too in the absence of any pathogen. Another GPCR, OLRN-1, functions in AWC neurons in the cell non-autonomous suppression of the canonical p38 MAPK PMK-1 immune pathway in the intestine 82 . olrn-1 mRNA is predicted to have target sites for mir-70, mir-75 and mir-80 and showed dramatic downregulation in the experimental dauers. Moreover, dopamine, through DOP-4, a D1-like dopamine receptor, suppresses innate immune responses in worms by downregulating the p38 MAPK PMK-1 pathway.

Even in the likely absence of any bacterial pathogen in the immediate environment, the experimental dauers showed upregulation of bli-3 mRNA, but ctl-1, ctl-2 (predicted to have target site for mir-75), ctl-3 mRNAs as well as sod-5 mRNA got heavily downregulated and that is probably due to reduced DAF-16 activity. Therefore, it could be possible that ROS produced by BLI-3 resulted in tissue damage in the experimental dauers and contributed to their collapse.Interleukin-17 (IL-17) is a pro-inflammatory cytokine 89-91 and its mRNA level showed diminishment in the experimental dauers. In mammals, it is involved both in host defence and in pathological inflammatory conditions such as autoimmune diseases. IL-17 is produced predominantly by the Th17 cells, whose differentiation from precursor T cells depend on IL-6 and TGF-\u03b2. Again, it is to be noted that in quiescent dauers the expression of the lattercandidate (DAF-7/TGF-\u03b2) gets modulated by XRN-2 regulated miRNAs. IL-17 facilitates numerous immune and inflammatory responses by regulating the expression of various inflammatory mediators, which include cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. It is involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, where it orchestrates the neutrophilic influx into the airways and enhances T-helper 2 (Th2) cell-mediated eosinophilic airway inflammation in mice, and similar events have also been recorded in patient samples 91-93 . IL-17 has also been implicated in promoting inflammatory response and inducing secondary injuries to poststroke tissue. In C. elegans, neuronal production of IL-17 suppresses intestinal defence mechanisms against infection 89,90 . It has also been shown that IL-17 and its receptors ILCR-1/ ILCR-2, as well as the downstream ACTL-1-IRAK-MALT-1-NFKI-1 complex-mediated signalling are required in one hub interneuron to increase its response to presynaptic input from oxygen sensors. This allows C. elegans to persistently escape high oxygen concentrations. Thus, IL-17 signalling promotes aversion to noxious stimuli. IL-17 neuronal activity allows integration of sensory inputs and appropriate cognitive behaviour in multiple species. Coordination of the immune response with an appropriate behaviour (escape, learning, social interactions) likely increases organism's fitness. Now, the mRNAs of ilc-17.1 (IL-17) and its receptor ilcr-1 have target sites for mir-80 and mir-70, mir-77, mir-80, respectively. Whereas, nfki-1 and malt-1 mRNAs, downstream components of this pathway, host conserved target sites for mir-80 and mir-246, respectively. All these miRNAs were upregulated in the experimental dauers and accordingly, expression of ilc-17.1, ilcr-1, nfki-1",

Notably, PRC2 mediated formation of H3K27me3 marks and MES-4 mediated H3K36me3 marks counterbalance each other to ensure correct gene expression in the germline. MES-4 function alleviates the germline specific autosomal genes from the repressive activity of PRC2 and limits its repressive action on other autosomal regions harbouring somatic genes, as well as on genes housed in X chromosomes. MES-4 upregulation in experimental dauers might have led to changes in the bona fide distribution of H3K36me3 and H3K27me3 patterns in the genome and resulted in the expression of those germline enriched genes (Fig.",

Release of undesired cytokines as well as inappropriate quantities of bona fide cytokines often get referred as disequilibrated cytokine network, and when that happens above a critical level, it is called a cytokine storm 116 . It can interfere with normal cellular function and cause systemic alterations leading to heavy inflammation that can cause tissue damage and organ failure. Pathogenic infections, especially many viral infections often result in cytokine storms in patients. SARS-CoV-2 patients are known to display altered cytokine profiles that include changes in interleukins (IL-1, -6, -8, -17), TNFs and IFNs 116 .

Most of the revelations on miRNA metabolism in worms have been proven to be conserved 109,120 , and the recent finding that the human homologue of worm XRN-2 regulates mature miRNAs that are of pathophysiological significance in several human cancers further strengthened this notion 112 . Therefore, it does not require any stretch of imagination to postulate that hsXRN2 might be playing regulatory roles in similar/ identical pathways, as described in this study, which are operational in equivalent cellular states and beyond, and thus it might be of foremost importance to human physiology, both in health and disease. Finally, pathogenic molecules/ peptides, including viral peptides, are known to target proteins and enzymes central to human metabolism, a strategy adopted to debilitate/ hijack the host system 121 . Accordingly, it was shown that the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein interferes with key DNA damage repair protein BRCA1, as well as with 53BP1, and thereby potentially affects V(D)J recombination process central to adaptive immunity 122 .hsXRN2, a key player in cellular homeostasis, in all likelihood, might also be a potent target of pathogenic and viral peptides/ molecules. Thus, molecular docking studies involving an atomic structure of hsXRN2 might facilitate the first step to appreciate the possible pathophysiological consequences of interference of its function upon infection, and that will not only augment vivid understanding of the therapeutic potential of hsXRN2 but might also pave way for designing of strategies for clinical interventions.SC designed the research and experiments.
