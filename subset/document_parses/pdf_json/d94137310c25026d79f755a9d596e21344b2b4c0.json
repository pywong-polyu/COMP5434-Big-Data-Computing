Professional participation is part of their involvement in daily occupations, which are taking place in teachers' socio-cultural context and are necessary for their well-being. Teachers' work performance can be enabled or constrained by their professional habits, including habits while using computers. We investigated awareness of and adherence to recommendations on ergonomics and preventive measures for back pain among the Faculty of Health Sciences employees. This study was aimed at investigating the relationship between the influence of their habits during computer use and back pain. An online questionnaire was sent to the teaching staff of the Faculty of Health Sciences (n = 115). 73% of the staff opened the online questionnaire, 43% fully completed the questionnaire. Data were processed using SPSS statistical program, version 20.0. Descriptive statistics, Pearson's correlation coefficient, and factor analysis were calculated. Analysis of the results showed a significant statistical association between the professional habits and roles [daily computer use (r = .443, P < .01); position of different body parts during computer use [head (r = .669, P < .001), shoulder (r = .446, P < .01), legs and feet (r = .483, P < .01), screen inclination (r = .577, P < .01), adjusting chair settings (r = .608, P < .01), distance between eyes and screen (r = .766, P < .01)]; physical activities break at work [r = .758, P < .01], and back pain. Considering ergonomic principles when designing the work environment can have a major impact on employees' health and quality of work. As experts in the field of health sciences, faculty members are not sufficiently aware of the impact of an improperly designed work environment on employee health, which affects work habits.",

Among musculoskeletal disorders, low back pain causes the greatest burden with a prevalence of 568 million people. Musculoskeletal disorders are the leading contributor to disability worldwide, with low back pain being the leading cause of disability in 160 countries (WHO). Musculoskeletal disorders severely limit mobility and dexterity and lead to early retirement, decreased well-being, and reduced ability to participate in social life. Due to population growth and aging, the number of people with musculoskeletal disorders is increasing rapidly. Disabilities related to musculoskeletal disorders have increased and are projected to continue to increase in the coming decades. 1 The International Association for the study of pain 2 defines pain as an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with or resembling actual or potential tissue damage. They also highlight 6 important clues and etymology: (1) Pain is always a personal experience, influenced to varying degrees by biological, psychological, and social factors.",

(4) It should be respected when a person refers to an experience as pain. (5) Although pain usually serves an adaptive function, it can have a negative impact on function and social and psychological well-being. (6) Verbal description is only one of several behaviors used to express pain. The inability to communicate does not preclude a human or nonhuman animal from feeling pain. 2 Humans adapt to sitting with varying limb positions, while the body position remains relatively stable. Problems of the musculoskeletal system first manifest themselves as functional disorders. If they are not detected and corrected in time, morphological and structural disorders may result. [3] [4] [5] A body position in which we remain for a long period can cause static stress on muscles and joints. Some factors cause the susceptibility of the spine to the occurrence of discomfort, pain, and injury. 5, 8, 9 The occurrence of pain and factors associated with musculoskeletal disorders have been studied in employees working in various fields of human activity, including Slovenian physical education teachers, with the most frequent health problems occurring in the lower back in both genders. 8 The results of a study in the Netherlands 9 showed that workers who perform heavy physical work and workers who are mainly sedentary have problems in the neck and upper extremities. Pain and musculoskeletal disorders occurred due to irregular, non-ergonomic sitting, flexion and rotation of the neck during work. A statistically significant difference between the occurrence of lower spine pain in teachers and the time the body is in the position of static flexion was demonstrated by Wong and his colleagues. 10 Sleep disturbance, prolonged standing during the session, and irregular physical activity have been associated with neck/shoulder pain and headache. 6 Durmus and Ilhanli 11 found that physical activity is associated with low back pain, especially among teachers in Physical Education classes.",

Bilban and Djomba 14 focused not only on the type of work condition, but also on age, gender, lifestyle, education, social class, living environment, and psychological well-being as risk factors for the development of back pain. However, the importance of the influence of lifestyle with physical activity on the occurrence of back pain should not be forgotten. 21, 22 All employees should learn how to work properly and protect their health, including professional habits and roles in routine workplace activities. Employees should take responsibility for their health at work, as we spend one-third of our daily time at work. 13, 17 Ergonomic promotion and interventions to improve and maintain health in the work environment are successful only when employees actively collaborate with professionals to reduce stress and improve work-related health problems. 23 Consideration of work-related factors and individual factors such as female gender, age, and teaching experience 6 is also important in reducing stress. Poor posture, unsuitable furniture, lifting, and carrying have also been associated with a high prevalence of musculoskeletal disorders. 4 Regular physical activity has been shown to be a protective factor. 4 For example, a recent study of school teachers in Botswana found that musculoskeletal disorders prevented some teachers from performing their normal activities and caused some to change jobs or duties, limit their activities at home, and seek medical attention. 4 The Slovenian National Institute of Health 24 collected data on absenteeism and reported that 4.5% of absenteeism in Slovenia in 2020 was due to back pain, which is one of the most common causes. As health professionals, we should believe that we alone are responsible for our health. As health professionals, we have the knowledge to change workplaces and reorganize our professional habits and roles. The aim of our study is to find out whether workers receive recommendations on the principles of ergonomics in sedentary work, whether they engage in physical activity in their free time, how often pain symptoms occur, and whether there is a relationship between these items. The results of the study will guide the management in designing workstations and the employees in finding human resources in the Faculty of Health Sciences. The findings will also help in formulating appropriate intervention targets and management strategies to improve teachers' health in performing their professional duties and habits, minimize the prevalence and impact of back pain among teachers, and reduce absenteeism.",

Based on a review of the literature and related laws in this area, we formulated individual statements of the questionnaire. We pilot tested the questionnaire with 20 elementary school teachers to clarify the individual statements of the questionnaire. The online survey was designed to collect information about the design or setup of the workstation for completing computer tasks (posture and positioning of the teacher's work), sitting time, frequency of pain symptoms, and physical activity during leisure time. Reliability was measured using the Cronbach's alpha coefficient for 8 items on posture of different body parts while working at the computer (\u03b1 = .97). Two of the items had lower correlations with the overall reliability coefficient score, but their exclusion did not improve the reliability coefficient and therefore were not excluded. Validity was assessed using the correlation of the same variables. The value obtained was 48 DF (.05) = .273, with Pearson correlation coefficients ranging from .486 to .694 (P < .05).",

If pain interfered with teachers' daily computer work, they rated the frequency of occurrence of back pain on a five-point Likert scale, with 1 representing once per week and 5 representing 5 times per week. In the second part, teachers rated the postures and positions they adopt while working on the computer and the work environment in which they use the computer. The workplace is designed or set up in such a way that computer tasks can be performed. In formulating the questions, we considered work postures in light of the ergonomic recommendations for sedentary computer work. 25 We asked teachers to rate the factual statements related to the ergonomic recommendations at their own workstation by rating the posture, chair, keyboard, and monitor on a 5-point Likert scale from 1 to 5, with 1 representing \"strongly disagree\" and 5 representing \"strongly agree.\"",

Using the varimax method, we obtained the factor weights for 2 new factors, which are presented in Table 4 and account for 69.78% of the total variance of variable D: Back pain explained. A higher factor weight value means that the largest contribution to the variance belongs to the explanation of all changes in the disease. In the present case, the dimensions of the content of the first factor have high factor weights and explain the content of the first factor. The first factor, which after rotation accounted for 41.60% of the total variance of variable D: Back Pain explained, was \"The way of sitting\".

            "text": "With knowledge \"For better public health\" is the motto of the National Institute from Public Health, 27 and there are many important reasons to highlight the workplace as an important arena for future health promotion. 13, 24, 28, 29 Musculoskeletal disorders are the most prevalent occupational diseases in Europe. About a quarter of European workers report that their work affects their health in the form of back pain. Similarly, 30 Musculoskeletal disorders are a common occupational problem in the teaching profession. 4 Our study confirms that back pain is one of the musculoskeletal disorders that occur in 6% of workers, while 13% of teachers report not having back pain. In addition to objective health status, workers' sick leave is influenced by many other factors from personal, professional, and wider environments, 4,28 while performance patterns are already established as professional or personal habits and roles. In the Faculty of Health Sciences, 40% of faculty regularly exercise 3 to 5 times per week and lead healthy lifestyles. Working conditions have a major impact on absenteeism. 30 We are not sufficiently aware that our bodies and our concentration benefit from regular breaks so that we can continue to work. From our research, 12% of employees never get up before completing their tasks, and 37% of employees get up due to physiological needs. The external causes of back pain occurrence pointed out by Zurc 20 are usually due to workload, which she includes a mismatch between work furniture and anthropometric characteristics, as well as a lack of physical activity during leisure time. With the cited results, she points to the need for movement breaks (physical activity) at work before pain occurs. Using a metaanalysis, she showed a direct significant positive effect of physical activity in the workplace, which she included in the study. She highlighted 2 important forms of physical activity: leisure-time physical activity and workplace activities that have a synergistic effect. Leisure time physical activity 13, 29, 31 and workplace physical activity 32 have also been significantly associated with back pain in various studies of primary and secondary school teachers and health care workers. 33 In our research, we found no statistically significant correlation between variables D: Back pain and C: Physical activity during leisure time, but a negative statistical correlation (r = \u00c0.460; p < .01) was found between variables C: Physical activity during leisure time and B: Physical activities break at work ( Table 2 ). The factors that are negatively correlated with back pain are the protective factors mentioned by Erick and Smith. 4 Physical activity is one of the healthy habits and an important part of leisure time. Only 5% of teachers in the Faculty of Health Sciences are not physically active in their free time, and 21% of teachers participate in sports activities only occasionally. In the study conducted by Biernat and Roguski 34 in Poland, 43% of academic teachers chose physical activity as a way to spend their free time. Various authors present the importance of participation in recreational sports activities for academic teachers and confirm that a teacher's lifestyle can influence the healthy lifestyle of students. 13, 29, [34] [35] [36] This is one of the more important roles of the teaching profession. Technological advancement is most responsible for sedentary and passive lifestyle. 16, 19 To get information through our sedentary jobs, we often use information and communication technology. It is easier to receive information from a colleague via email or phone call than to interrupt sitting and intentionally, with the intention of taking a physical activity break at work, go to the office next door.",

We called the second factor \"Characteristics of furniture (workplace design)\". With this result, we confirm that there is dependence between back pain and the position of different parts of the body during computer use in teachers. The goal of ergonomics science is to reduce the incidence of health problems among workers who use computers. Unfortunately, we have no information on whether employees who have an ergonomic chair take full advantage of these ergonomic opportunities. By supporting the body parts optimally, we reduce their static load. We reduce the negative effects of constant sitting by using ergonomic work chairs with appropriate lines that help the body to adopt a relaxed and correct posture. The additional possibility of adjusting the chair in height, depth, and rotation provides a better adaptation to each user and prevents discomfort, pain, or injury.",

The goals include redesigning the workplace to include ergonomic workplace design, changing work habits when physical activities interrupt the work process, and changing work roles so that teachers have fewer administrative tasks to complete in the future. The research was conducted prior to COVID-19. We now wonder if ergonomic principles were considered in the redesign of the workplace and how COVID-19 changed teachers' work habits and work roles.",

The human body has evolved into a shape that is best suited for slow movements. When using the computer, some parts of the body move little or are in an unsuitable position, especially when we use the mouse. Long-term computer use has negative effects on the health of individuals. Occasionally, pain occurs that we do not pay much attention to at first. Only when a chronic injury or even illness requires medical examination and long-term treatment do we become aware of the discomfort. With the above data, we would like to support the importance of pain research among teachers in education.",

We would like to emphasize that it is necessary to develop ergonomic promotion and intervention measures to maintain the health of workers in the work environment. These both preventive and curative projects have a good positive impact on students' health. Teachers and students need to be aware that there is a strong link between work roles, work habits, and training in the process of education.",
