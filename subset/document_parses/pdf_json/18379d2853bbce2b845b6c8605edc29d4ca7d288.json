To date, there is no approved vaccine or specific therapy against COVID-19, but many trials are ongoing with some of them showing promising results. It has been shown recently that patients with cancer are at high risk of infection and they are more susceptible to develop severe events such as the necessity of invasive ventilation and death. Therefore, this crisis presents a real challenge for health systems especially in low-and middle-income countries where the health systems are already fragile such as African countries. In this article, we describe the epidemiological situation of the infection in Morocco and the different challenges in cancer centers in the era of COVID-19, in addition to various strategies that have been implemented to prevent and control the infection spread in oncological units in order to ensure the continuation of adequate cancer care.",

This crisis had a huge impact on health systems, and this impact was expected to be higher in African countries including Morocco because of the fragile health system due to preexisting lacks in equipment such as the reduced number of beds in hospitals in general and in intensive care units in particular, in addition to the insufficient number of medical staff (comparing to global Moroccan population) and the shortage in ventilators and material of protection such as face masks. 1 Moroccan government and health authorities have shown effective early management in addressing the crisis by a number of early measures that contributed efficiently in limiting the spread of the virus. The first detected case in Morocco has been reported on March 2, 2020, which was imported from Italy. Then Morocco has declared the closing of all borders on March 15 and closing all schools, universities, and mosques in addition to prohibiting all gatherings on March 16. 2 The state of emergency in the country and curfew was declared from March 20, 2020, and wearing the face masks became mandatory from April 7. Morocco has launched the largest field hospital in Africa, which was completed in 2 weeks, with a capacity of more than 700 beds, and has prepared new intensive care units with the capacity of more than new 1500 beds in addition to local production of more than 5 million masks per day. Health authorities also are ramping up the testing capacity for COVID-1 by increasing the number of laboratories across the country from 3 to 24 by the end of May and reaching 17 500 tests daily for a total Moroccan population counting 36 millions.",

Additionally, more than 90% of cases in Morocco were reported to be asymptomatic or with mild symptoms. 3 Regarding the impact on patients with cancer, the situation was and still very challenging in this context. The main goal in Morocco was to keep the anticancer centers COVID-free to continue providing cancer care adequately. Liang et al have reported that patients with cancer might have a higher risk of COVID-19 than patients without cancer. 4 They have also shown that patients with cancer presented a higher risk of severe events such as admission in intensive care unit requiring invasive ventilation and death in comparison with individuals without cancer, especially if they received chemotherapy or underwent surgery in the past month. 4 Based on these findings, particular attention should be paid toward this vulnerable population who should be treated in this particular context. The main challenge is to continue ensuring a high quality of care in accordance with scientific recommendations and also ensuring the maximum safety and protection for patients, their families, and also for the medical staff.",

We consider that the situation has been well managed by all the early adopted measures, but there is a real fear about the negative impact of this crisis on cancer care in Morocco because of the delays in diagnosis and logistical difficulties to access to hospitals causing some deviations in the protocols of treatments. Additionally, there was an important switch on health resources to manage the COVID-19 crisis at the expense of investing in cancer drugs. These deviations may affect the outcomes of patients with cancer in intermediate and long terms. 9 In the future and after assessment of the impacts of this pandemic, it is very likely that many aspects of working in cancer care will permanently change. Therefore, balancing the risk of coronavirus infection for patients with cancer with the need to continue providing adequate treatments is a daily challenge for all cancer care workers worldwide with different degrees depending on the amplitude of the pandemic in each country and institution.",
