This knowledge is used in immune repertoire mining, where known binders are used to search bulk sequencing repertoires to identify new binders. However current computational methods cannot identify epitope convergence between antibodies from different clonotypes, limiting the sequence diversity of antigen-specific antibodies which can be identified. We describe how the antibody binding site, the paratope, can be used to cluster antibodies with common antigen reactivity from different clonotypes. Our method, paratyping, uses the predicted paratope to identify these novel cross clonotype matches. We experimentally validated our predictions on a Pertussis toxoid dataset. Our results show that even the simplest abstraction of the antibody binding site, using only the length of the loops involved and predicted binding residues, is sufficient to group antigen-specific antibodies and provide additional information to conventional clonotype analysis.",

A clonotype is defined as a group of antibody sequences which derive from a common progenitor B cell [10] . During B cell development, the variable (V), diversity (D) and joining (J) gene segments encoding the variable domain of the antibody heavy chain undergo recombination [11] . A requirement for two sequences to be predicted to share the same clonotype is therefore common V-and J-germline gene assignment [5] . The D gene is not usually included in standard clonotype definitions due to difficulty in its assignment [12] . The variable domain of the antibody heavy chain consists of the framework regions and hypervariable complementaritydetermining regions (CDRs). CDRHs 1 and 2 are encoded by the V gene while the region spanning the recombined V, D and J segments corresponds to the third and most diverse loop on the antibody heavy chain, the CDRH3. The processes of junctional diversification (the insertion of palindromic and random nucleotides at the junction between the V, D and J genes) during recombination as well as somatic hypermutation [11] during affinity maturation further contribute to the diversity of the CDRH3.",

The majority of antibodies binding to the same epitope in antibody-antigen complex structures in the Structural Antibody Database (SAbDab, a database of experimentally-solved antibody and antibody-antigen complex structures) have highly similar CDRH3s [23] . However, it has also been observed that multiple clonotypes may converge on the same epitope. For example, Scheid and colleagues identified clonotypes from distinct IGHV families converging on the CD4 binding site in gp120 [24] . Separate clonotypes have also been observed to bind to overlapping epitopes on the hemagglutinin stem [25] or globular head, and on multiple epitopes on the Ebola virus glycoprotein [26] . Wong and colleagues identified 190 pairs of antibodies with sub-80% CDRH3 amino acid identity binding to the same epitope within SAbDab [23, 27] . This convergence between clonotypes offers the potential to improve our understanding of the functional landscape of BCR repertoires; large-scale functional convergence between lineages could, for example, explain the apparent scarcity of public clonotypes [28] . This hypothesis is supported by evidence that while clonotypes are infrequently shared between individuals, the range of antibody structures that these clonotypes generate is more similar between individuals [29] .",

This process is referred to as \"immune repertoire mining\". Hsiao and colleagues performed clonotyping on a set of bulk repertoires and used the resultant clonotypes for hit expansion against two targets [9] . They achieved greater than an order of magnitude improvement in affinity for both targets and between 48% and 100% of tested heavy chain variants retained target-binding [9] . This suggests that sampling within a clonotype can be highly effective as a means of repertoire mining. However, the method does not allow the identification of binders to the same epitope which derive from different clonotypes, which currently limits the sequence distinctness of novel binders which can be recovered from immune repertoires.",

We show how paratyping allows clustering of antigenspecific sequences from different clonotypes, and is a rapid, structurally intuitive way of clustering functionally-related antibodies. Paratyping simplifies the complex phenomenon of antibody-antigen interaction into sets of shared residues. Learning the complexities of antibody-antigen interactions as part of a predictive model of antigen binding has been achieved in the case of the antigen-interaction of one therapeutic monoclonal antibody [30] . However, such approaches rely on a large (on the order of 10 4 ) library of experimentally validated binding and non-binding variants. Paratyping removes the need for large amounts of training data and is generalisable across antigens.",

Paratyping is then applied to a single-cell data set of sequences raised against Pertussis toxoid (PTx) in a transgenic mouse platform where it is as accurate as clonotyping but identifies different binders. We then perform a prospective experimental test of the method by expressing as monoclonal antibodies and experimentally testing predicted PTxbinding and non-binding antibodies mined from a set of non-enriched bulk heavy chain sequencing repertoires. Our experimental test demonstrates that paratyping identifies PTx-binding antibodies from different clonotypes to our original hits. This expands the sequence space available through repertoire mining and permits favourable shifts in in-silico developability metrics. Of particular advantage is paratyping's ability to prediction common antigen reactivity of antibodies from different V and J gene backgrounds, which has implications for large-scale repertoire analysis.",

In terms of antibody discovery, paratyping allows us to identify sequence-distinct antibodies that bind to the same epitope and which can differ significantly in developability or affinity. In the terms of repertoire analysis, paratyping expands our ability to functionally group antibodies beyond clonotypes, and therefore allows us to detect specific cases of epitope convergence between lineages -we found epitope convergence between V4-34/J6 and V4-59/J6 lineages, V4-39/J6 and V4-39/J4 lineages, V4-34/J5",

However, paratope identity across the germline-encoded CDRHs 1 and 2 is equal to or in excess of 75% across members of V1 and V7, and V3 and V4 (see Supplementary Figure 3 ), so we predict that it should be possible to use paratyping to find binders from different V gene families, should a large enough sequencing data set be mined. The implications of this for immune repertoire clustering are as yet unexplored. If such convergence is widespread, it is possible that clonotyping overestimates functional diversity and this may account for low proportions of clonotypes shared across individuals [3] .",

It should be noted that these method-unique predictions form the minority of predictions for either method (15-22% of predictions). The lower success rate of paratyping versus clonotyping may be attributable to the particularly low CDRH3 identity of these predictions to known binders -paratyping does not give special weight to the CDRH3 in the paratope identity calculation despite the particular role it plays in antigen complimentarity. Predictions with as little as 33% CDRH3 identity to a known binder were assayed but no antibody with an H3 amino acid identity below 56% bound to Pertussis toxoid, suggesting that paratyping could be further improved by the use of CDRH3 weighting.",

It has the advantage that it does not rely on the upkeep of consistent and complete germline databases (a leading cause of disagreement between germline annotation tools [40] ), but rather on the distribution of a pretrained paratope prediction model [41] .

We created a new way of categorising predictions in order to fully test the method in the context of an antibody discovery experiment. We define \"paratype-unique\" predictions as predictions which are not within the paratype of not only the probe in question (paratype-only) but of any of the full complement of 97 probes, and similarly for \"clonotype-unique\" predictions. Paratype-unique predictions are a more stringent subset of paratype-only predictions and present a greater challenge of the method (as such predictions tend to be corroborated by fewer probes). 48 predicted PTx-binding heavy chain sequences were selected from each of the three categories of prediction (\"paratype-unique\", \"clonotype-unique\" and \"both\").",

Pairings were only made where there was greater than 82% sequence identity across the residues considered to constitute the V H /V L interface, based on solvent accessibility [38] , in order to maximise the probability of expression. These positions lie outside of the CDRs and therefore do not enforce any constraint on binding site sequence identity.",
