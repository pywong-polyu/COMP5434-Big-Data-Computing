We distinguish two versions: one of them with integer coefficients and the other one with decimal coefficients in the affine function. We observed that the nature of the coefficients impacts the mathematical work used by the students, where we again focus on two of them: by direct estimation from the graph or by calculating the equation of the line. On the other hand, a feedback oriented towards the \"estimation\" strategy influences the mathematical work used by the students, even though a non-negligible group persists in the \"calculating\" strategy, which is partly explained by the perception of each of the strategies.",

On the other hand, the student approximates to y=-5 the image of x=1, image that is, indeed, close to -5, but less than it. Then, when evaluating in the equation, and entering the answer to the system, this considers it as incorrect. What calls the attention of this strategy is that, to calculate the linear equation, the student must make estimations for two points. As seen, in this case the student executes this procedure correctly, although, clearly, there is an inclination toward the integer numbers but, because of the nature of the coefficients, the student commits an error that leads to later errors, enlarging the distance between the obtained image from what the system considers as a good estimation. In some way, the semiotic-instrumental work, oriented by the use of the linear equation is so strong that it changes the way of 'visualizing' the graph, by orienting estimations toward integer values. When looking at the system's proposed feedback on Figure 9 , for one thing it is seen that the answer is on the limit defined by the system as correct. This can be considered as a limitation of the task, particularly of the validation and its associated punctuation. For example, the system could give a partial punctuation or include the extreme values of the interval although, in this case, it would be assumed that the image could be at the start of the first or fourth quarter, more than at the center, which would give a different sense to the visualization of the image.

The first is: What is the mathematical work that students do when reading a graph if the coefficients that describe an affine function change between whole numbers and decimals? Based on the data collected, we can answer that this work is purely semiotic. By using the grid as a semiotic tool, this can be seen more clearly when the coefficients are decimal numbers. On the other hand, when the coefficients are integers, we see a strong appearance of a semiotic-instrumental work, in which the linear equation is the symbolic artefact used. It is important to note that if the function is changed, for example a quadratic function, it is possible that a smaller portion of the students will use the algebraic strategy. Due to the need for three points and the emergence of a three-variable system of equations, this method would be much harder and could involve knowledge that is not as internalized by students as the linear equation is.",

The answer is yes, but the influence changes according to the task version. The effect is much higher if the coefficients are integers, due to the much lower change margin present, compared to the decimal number task. This calls the attention because, in this version of the task, those who chose calculating the linear equation as a solving strategy did not change said strategy in the second attempt.",

If, for example, the challenge is to find the image of a decimal number, it is possible that the mathematical work is also modified, or that the grid is eliminated, which would cause a change in the algorithm to give the correct or incorrect ranges.
