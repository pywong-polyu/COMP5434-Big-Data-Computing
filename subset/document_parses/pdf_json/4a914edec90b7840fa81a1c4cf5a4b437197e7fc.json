Methods A retrospective cohort study was conducted, including children treated for acute appendicitis (January 20th-May 11th, 2020). The data regarding the severity of appendicitis and outcome were collected and compared for two time periods, before and after the nationwide lockdown (March 17th, 2020). Results The number of cases of acute appendicitis increased by 77% during the lockdown (n = 39 vs. n = 69, p = 0.03). During the lockdown, children treated for appendicitis were older (11.1 vs. 8.9 years, p = 0.003), and were more likely to live more than 5 km away from our institution (77% vs. 52%, p = 0.017). Less children had previously consulted a general practitioner (15% vs. 33%, p = 0.028), whereas more children were transferred from other hospitals (52% vs. 31%, p = 0.043). There was no difference in terms of length of hospital stay, rate of postoperative intra-abdominal abscess, ER visits, and readmissions between both periods. Three children (4%) were diagnosed with COVID-19 and appendicitis. Conclusions Despite an increase in the number of children with appendicitis managed at our hospital during the COVID-19-related lockdown, management, and outcome remained similar. Although our pediatric center was strongly affected by this pandemic, maintaining our prior practice strategies for acute appendicitis avoided the occurrence of collateral damage for those children.",

With more than 6000 cases of COVID-19 diagnosed between March 1st and March 15th, France was one of the first European countries to be strongly affected by the pandemic [2] . The French government announced a series of widespread containment measures to take place on March 17th, 2020, ordering an 8-week nationwide lockdown, including closing all 'non-essential businesses and shops' and urging residents to remain home [2, 3] . To deal with the exponential increase in the number of patients requiring hospitalization for moderate or severe forms of COVID-19 and the shortage in medical equipment, many hospitals in France were restructured to focus on management of patients with COVID-19. As such, most surgical departments cancelled all non-urgent elective surgeries, and some pediatric surgery departments closed entirely, resulting in a decrease in the number of centers performing surgeries in children [4, 5] .",

Although the cause for appendicitis remains poorly understood, we hypothesized that the COVID-19 outbreak may influence our practice regarding number of cases, management, and outcome of acute appendicitis for several reasons [8] . First of all, as most general pediatric surgery departments closed, only referral pediatric centers remained functional, and with more than 3 million children in the region of Paris, the number of patients referred to our center for appendicitis treatment may increase [9] . Secondly, the lockdown ordered by the government may discourage parents in taking their child to the hospital, possibly resulting in delayed surgical management [10] . Moreover, it has been reported that COVID-19 infection may present predominantly with gastrointestinal symptoms in children, possibly resulting in misdiagnosed appendicitis [11] [12] [13] . Finally, appendicitis may be triggered in children by viral pathogens, possibly increasing the number of patients undergoing appendectomy [14] .",

We found that children managed for acute appendicitis at our center during the lockdown were older and were more likely to live more than 5 km away from our institution than children managed before the lockdown. This can possibly be explained by the fact that general surgery departments would usually manage these older patients and would not refer them to our pediatric tertiary surgery center before the lockdown. As a result, more than half of the patients managed during the lockdown had been transferred from other hospitals, underlying the role of specific centers in providing child care during this crisis. In this context of COVID-19 pandemic, several authors have advocated for nonoperative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis, in order to relieve healthcare systems and avoid potential exposure of healthcare professionals to SARS-CoV-2 during surgery [20, 21] . Some surgeons have modified their practice to a predominantly conservative management of uncomplicated acute appendicitis in adults during the COVID-19 pandemic [22] . Conservative management of uncomplicated appendicitis in selected children has been successfully reported in several studies, and has been reported as associated with a lower number of disability days and lower appendicitis health-care costs [23] . However, these results remain controversial as 23% of these children require appendectomy at 1 year and up to 46% of within 5 years [23, 24] . Moreover, in these studies, only 19% of children with acute appendicitis were eligible to conservative treatment. Recently, an American center reported treating all children with nonoperative management during the peak of the pandemic, including 45.5% of children that were eventually discharged without appendectomy [25] . Of these, 78% did not meet previously published criteria for nonoperative management of appendicitis [25] . In our institution, we decided not to modify our practice, and all children with uncomplicated acute appendicitis underwent surgery according to our preexisting protocol. We believe that modifying our practice regarding management of uncomplicated appendicitis requires a strong standardized management, that should not be instituted in a time of healthcare crisis. Moreover, nonoperative management of uncomplicated appendicitis in children may result in an increase in length of stay and readmission, that should be avoided during this COVID-19 pandemic [26, 27] . In the study from Kvasnovsky et al., initial nonoperative management resulted in an increase in length of stay for children eventually undergoing appendectomy for uncomplicated appendicitis, and medium to long-term follow-up is to date unavailable for patients who were treated nonoperatively [25] . Finally, most surgeons that modified their practice to a conservative management due to COVID-19 indicated they would be returning to operative management after the pandemic [22] . Maintaining the sameday discharge appendectomy in uncomplicated appendicitis remained a safe option during this pandemic [28] .",

However, these results are challenging to translate to pediatric appendicitis, as the main risk factors for mortality or pulmonary complications identified in these studies were age > 70 years, an ASA score > 3-4, malignant disease or major surgery [29, 30] . To date, no study has demonstrated an increase in complications or death after surgery in COVID-19 children. Moreover, no study has compared outcomes after surgical and conservative treatment of appendicitis in children with COVID-19, and it remains unknown if conservative treatment of appendicitis is safer than surgical treatment in children with COVID- 19. It has been suggested that laparoscopy increases the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission through the theoretical possibility of viral transmission from aerosolization of tissue and peritoneal fluid during surgery, dissuading some teams from performing laparoscopy during the pandemic [31, 32] . We maintained laparoscopic approach for appendectomy, as several randomized controlled trials have demonstrated that laparoscopy is associated to improved outcomes compared to open surgery in children with appendicitis [33] [34] [35] [36] . During this crisis, we aimed to provide optimal management of surgical emergencies in children. Nonetheless, we implemented precautions in order to reduce the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission during surgery. It is still controversial whether peritoneal fluid of COVID-19 patients contain SARS-CoV-2, as only few studies report analysis of peritoneal fluid with discordant results [37, 38] . Similarly, SARS-CoV-2 has never been identified in surgical smoke [39] .",

This could be due to the shortage in personal protective equipment, rendering general practitioners less available and less likely to receive children, that were stigmatized as being the \"link in the transmission chain\" [40] . Moreover, parents might have felt more comfortable in consulting at a pediatric hospital than a general practitioner, feeling that they were less likely to encounter the virus and that the pediatric ER would provide optimal care for their child. A previous study from China highlighted the changes in children's healthcare visits during the COVID-19 pandemic [41] .",

Moreover, time to appendectomy remained lower than reported in previous studies [42] . Finally, we found no difference in outcome in terms of length of hospital stay and development of IAA between both periods, suggesting management of acute appendicitis was as efficient throughout the study period.",

Indeed, Patient 1 with a context of suspected COVID-19 household contact stayed home for 4 days after being diagnosed with suspected COVID-19 with predominant gastrointestinal symptoms by a general practitioner. After arrival at our institution, the misleading associated COVID-19 infection resulted in additional delay in diagnosis and time to appendectomy. This overall delay in diagnosis of appendicitis due to the associated COVID-19 infection resulted in a severe form of complicated appendicitis and a complicated postoperative course requiring IAA drainage. Moreover, he visited the ER several times after discharge, for possible COVID-19 residual symptoms. The other child that was diagnosed with asymptomatic RT-PCR-positive COVID-19 associated with acute appendicitis visited the ER 17 days after discharge for symptoms related to COVID-19.",

We chose to compare the lockdown period to the period immediately preceding the lockdown instead of comparing to the previous year, in order to highlight differences due to the lockdown, and avoid bias such as different ER, anesthesia, and surgical teams. We do not believe that seasonal variation may have a role in this increase in incidence of appendicitis as studies show an increase during the summer months and low incidence from March to May [43, 44] . Finally, the change in testing strategy during the study period precludes the true assessment of rates of COVID-19 positive children treated for acute appendicitis throughout the whole study period. Indeed, due to equipment shortage, we could not initially perform systematic RT-PCR for all children upon admission, and only children with a history of household COVID-19 infection or respiratory symptoms were tested. Another limitation to our study is our inability to assess any potential collateral damage made to medical personnel in pursuing our preexisting surgical management of acute appendicitis. Although we have no known cases of COVID-19 contamination of medical personnel due to exposure during appendectomy of a child with acute appendicitis during the lockdown, this would have been challenging to assess during this healthcare crisis.",
