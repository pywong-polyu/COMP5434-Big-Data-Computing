Currently, to prevent transmission through close contact, wearing face masks in public transport and spaces has been made obligatory in several Asian countries including South Korea (KBS, 2020), China (NHC, 2020) , and Taiwan (Taipei-City-Police-Department, 2020); in European countries including Germany (BMI, 2020), Switzerland (Swiss-government, 2020) , and the UK (UK, 2020); and in North America, including Canada (Toronto, 2020) and the USA (CNN, 2020) . A recent report from the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) stated that inappropriately disposing of masks-even in numbers as small as 1% of the total used face masks-would result in about 10 million face masks per month, equaling 30,000-40,000 kg of plastic dispersed in the environment (Patr\u00edcio Silva et al., 2020; WWF, 2020) . The types of masks can be classified as face masks, surgical masks, N95 masks, cotton masks, etc.",

To assess the soil ecotoxicity of the MB filter, white pristine MB filters were removed from masks, cut using micro-scissors, and then sieved using a stainless sieve (300 \u00b5m, Chunggye sieve, Gyeonggi-do, South Korea) and a stainless spatula. To characterize the tested face masks, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR, 4100 type A, resolution 0.96 cm \u2212 1 , JASCO, Japan) was used with attenuated total reflection (ATR) mode. High-resolution field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, 1.0-5.0 kV, SU8010, Hitachi High-Technologies Corporation, Japan) was also used for observing the shape of the MB filter fibers and fragments.

As reported by earlier studies (Aragaw, 2020; Fadare and Okoffo, 2020) , materials of pristine face masks such as the MB filter and the inner and outer layers of face masks are characterized by polypropylene; we confirmed this finding using Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (Fig. 2c) in this study. Stereomicroscopy and FE-TEM verified that the MB filter and the inner and outer layers were made of microfibers (Fig. S1 ). The morphology of the cut pristine MB filter fragments (<300 \u00b5m sieved) and fibers which were detached from the fragments are shown in Fig. 2b ,c (see also Fig. S2 ). It was indicated that mixtures of MB filter fibers and fragments can be introduced in the soil environment in tandem. Subsequently, ingestion and egestion of these pristine MB filter fibers and fragments by earthworms Eisenia andrei and springtails Folsomia candida were observed through bioassays (Fig. S3,S4 ). As shown in Fig. S2 , single small microfibers were detached from fragments of the MB filters and these fibers or smaller fragments of the MB filters might be ingested by sectional F. candida. Excreted earthworm casts containing MB filter fragments were evident on the soil surface since Day 1 of the experiment. In the case of F. candida, ingested MB filter fragments were observed in the F. candida compared to controls and nile red leaching controls as well. Total 13% of juvenile and 27% of adult individuals ingested mask MB filter fragments after 7 days exposure to the uptake test (Fig. S3) . These results suggested that MB filter fibers and fragments are ingestible by soil invertebrates and hence, they can be distributed via feeding activity. Moreover, we observed roughness increase, surface deterioration, and fragmentation of thinner MB filter fibers of <1 \u00b5m size on the surface of MB filter fibers, after exposure to earthworms and springtails ( Fig. 3 ; see also Fig. S5,S6 ). As shown in Fig. 3 a1 , it was determined that pristine microfibers of MB filters showed dominant carbon signals based on the EDX spot analysis. In addition, it was also separated between fragmented nanofibers and soil particles based on the presence of a Si signal (Fig. 3 b1-b2, c1-c2 ). Fig. 3 b1 and c1 suggested fragmented nanofibers (~0.1 \u00b5m thickness) with predominant carbon signals without meaningful Si signals. These results indicated that if soil invertebrates ingest and egest MB filter fibers, nanofibers would probably be produced due to biofragmentation. However, there are some limitations due to the characterization of the fragmented nanofibers in the present study, and these limitations are discussed in the Discussion Section.",

Intracellular esterase activity in exposed earthworm coelomocytes dropped considerably to 62% (p<0.05, F-value=5, DF=2) as compared to that of the control groups (i.e., 100%). In the case of seminal vesicle tissues, less mature sperms and spermids (blue-stained nuclei) were observed in the exposed groups (Fig. S7 ) and the seminal vesicle score declined to 0.8 as compared to that of the control groups (Fig. 5) (p<0.05, F-value=5,  DF=2) . On the contrary, MB filter fibers and fragments did not adversely affect earthworm survival or result in pathological symptoms such as bleeding, swelling, thinning, and severance. The lysosomal stability and oxidative stress in coelomocytes were also not significantly impaired (p>0.05) (Fig. 5; see also Fig. S8 ). The number of matured oocytes in the exposed groups (3.0\u00b12.1) decreased slightly without statistical difference compared to that of the control groups (2.0\u00b12.0; see Fig. S9 ). These results of the earthworm assay suggested that MB filter fibers and fragments do not affect earthworms at the individual level but affect them at the tissue and cellular levels.",

            "text": "Owing to the increasing use of face masks, their improper disposal (Patr\u00edcio Silva et al., 2020; WWF, 2020) , and the consequent littering during the COVID-19 pandemic (Patr\u00edcio Silva et al., 2021) , plastic pollution is inevitably going to be a pressing issue globally. In order to predict the environmental impact of microplastics derived from face masks beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, we focused on the ecotoxicological effects of microplastic fibers and fragments and investigated the possibility of plastic nanofiber generation due to biofragmentation. Earthworms and springtails are good ecological indicators; they are ideal species for assessing the biofragmentation of nanofibers from MB filter microfibers and the adverse effects, as they are representative consumers and invertebrates in the soil ecosystem (ECB, 2003) . We observed ingestion of MB filter fragments and fibers by earthworms and springtails on Day 1 and Day 7 of the experiment, respectively. We observed rapid uptake of microplastic particles by these organisms, thereby confirming earlier studies (Dawson et al., 2018a; Kwak and An, 2021) . After confirming ingestion or egestion of MB filter fragments by earthworms or springtails (see Fig. S3 , S4), fragments were collected from earthworm casts (Day 21) and springtail test soil (Day 28); these were analyzed using high-resolution FE-SEM and EDX spectroscopy to obtain images of plastic nanofiber fragmentations. As shown in Fig. 3 b1 and c1, we observed nanofibers at the surface of the MB filter fibers after exposure to earthworms and springtails. This observation indicated that face masks can be the source of polypropylene nanofibers by Fig. 3 . FE-SEM images (a-c) and EDX spot spectrum (a1-c2) of (a) pristine MB filter fibers and fragments, (b) collected MB filter fibers and fragments from springtail test soil 28 days after exposure and (c) collected MB filter fibers and fragments from earthworm casts 21 days after exposure. Orange arrows (b1 and c1) indicate fragmented nano-sized fibers on the surface of MB filter microfibers. White symbol of element in the inner box of a1-c2 indicates meaningfully detected elements. Green arrows (b2-b3 and c2) indicate what we interpret as soil particles exhibiting Si signals. White chemical element symbols in (a1-c2) show significant signals detected by EDX. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) biofragmentation, which can subsequently be distributed by soil species and dispersed to soil ecosystems. Such biofragmented nanoplastics from microplastics have been recently detected by observing the Antarctic krill (Dawson et al., 2018b) , earthworm gut bacteria (Huerta Lwanga et al., 2018) , and earthworm (Kwak and An, 2021) . Even without biofragmentation in the environment, face masks may become weathered and fragmented, thereby releasing cracked polypropylene microplastics when exposed to visible and UV light (Tang et al., 2019; Uheida et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2021) . In addition, polypropylene microplastics derived from face masks can absorb existing pollutants in the ecosystem such as heavy metals (Zhou et al., 2020) , organic pollutants Wu et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2021) , and cosmetic additives (Zhang et al., 2018) ; hence, soil species ingesting polypropylene microplastics combined with other pollutants essentially act as vectors of negative health impacts. For example, synergistic toxicity of cadmium and polypropylene microplastic were observed in earthworms species (Zhou et al., 2020) . Recently, it was also reported that face masks themselves release heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Sb, and Cu) or organic chemicals (polyethylene glycol) (Sullivan et al., 2021) . By considering the fiber shape, we expect a possibility of a similar toxicity between fibers and fragments of MB filters (PP) and polyester fiber cushions (Prendergast-Miller et al., 2019) because polyester fibers did not cause mortality and genes related oxidative stress but affected the mt and hsp70 gene expression in earthworms Lumbricus terrestris (Prendergast-Miller et al., 2019) .",

By considering the worst exposure scenario with high concentration, these soil ecotoxicities were related to the long-term toxicity of polypropylene, based on previous research (Zhou et al., 2020) . Zhou et al. (2020) that observed time-and concentration-dependent toxicities of polypropylene microplastics (<150 \u00b5m) and their effect on earthworm growth rate and mortality over 14, 28, and 42 days; the longer the duration of the exposure, the higher the mortality and growth inhibition of earthworms. MB filter leachates can be toxic for organisms because MB filters might contain additives such as anti-oxidants, flame retardants, and stabilizers (Dutton, 2008) . Polypropylene microplastics may also release volatile organic compounds such as benzene and propanal (Lomonaco et al., 2020) . For instance, it was reported that leachates from polypropylene microplastics impaired the larval development of pearl oysters (Gardon et al., 2020) and brown mussels (Gandara e Silva et al., 2016) , and reduced the survival of copepods (Bejgarn et al., 2015) .",

The limitations of the present study can be described as follows. (1) The modes of toxic action and bio transportation of face mask fibers and fragments need to be elucidated. (2) This study simulated the worst-case exposure scenario of a relatively high concentration; therefore, the impacts of lower exposure concentrations of mask fragments should be investigated. (3) This study focused only on the MB filter. An MB filter would rarely be discarded from a mask in a realistic environment and some masks have no MB filters; therefore, mixture toxicity of all the mask components should be considered, and results of this study were limited within effects of MB filters not outer nor inner layer of masks. (4) How nanofibers were generated by soil invertebrates, particularly by springtails, remains unclear because the present study did not use defaunated or sterilized soil. Therefore, multiple factors such as soil microorganisms, soil exoenzymes, gut microbiomes, digestive enzymes, and burrowing behaviors might impact the generation of nanofibers from microfibers. (5) Lastly, quantified results such as the measurement of the decreased size of the egested MB filters was not possible in the present study because the size of the MB filter fragments was not fixed The asterisk indicates significant decreases in the exposed groups (p<0.05).",

The asterisk indicates significant decreases in the exposed groups compared to the control groups (p<0.05). With this study, we have elucidated the ecotoxicity of face mask waste. Currently, the COVID-19 pandemic poses a serious global threat to human health and survival; therefore, the use of face masks is inevitable, and, unfortunately, so is face mask waste production. With this study, we advocate the proper use-as well as disposal-of face masks for the sake of human health and ecosystem stability during and beyond the COVID-19 pandemic.",
