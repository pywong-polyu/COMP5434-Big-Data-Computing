The purpose of this study was to identify how health behaviors, level of stress, financial and food security have been impacted by the pandemic among Canadian families with young children. Parents (mothers, n = 235 and fathers, n = 126) from 254 families participating in an ongoing study completed an online survey that included close and open-ended questions. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the quantitative data and qualitative responses were analyzed using thematic analysis. More than half of our sample reported that their eating and meal routines have changed since COVID-19; most commonly reported changes were eating more snack foods and spending more time cooking. Screen time increased among 74% of mothers, 61% of fathers, and 87% of children and physical activity decreased among 59% of mothers, 52% of fathers, and 52% of children. Key factors influencing family stress include balancing work with childcare/homeschooling and financial instability. While some unhealthful behaviors appeared to have been exacerbated, other more healthful behaviors also emerged since COVID-19. Research is needed to determine the longer-term impact of the pandemic on behaviors and to identify effective strategies to support families in the post-COVID-19 context.",

In order to identify how best to support families in this post-COVID-19 context, we need to understand how these fundamental changes have impacted families in Canada.",

            "text": "The government-mandated physical distancing restrictions to reduce the spread of COVID-19 likely have had a considerable impact on families' health-related behaviors. Limited access to outdoor recreational facilities, such as parks and playgrounds, reduces the opportunity for families to be physically active. Closures of schools and child-care centers may have further reduced children's activity levels as these settings are shown to be associated with increased physical activity [1] . Reduced physical activity may also impact sleep quality and related routines [2] . Furthermore, Canadian food purchasing has shifted in response to COVID-19; revenues from dry goods, shelf-stable foods, and frozen produce have drastically increased relative to the average of the previous year [3] . This shift may influence family eating patterns and dietary intake. Lastly, as families navigate working and learning from home, time spent on screen-based devices has also reportedly increased [4] . Collectively, these changes may have a lasting impact on health outcomes among parents and their children. While existing research has explored changes in health behaviors among adolescents and youth due to COVID-19 [5] [6] [7] , limited research has examined the impact of COVID-19 among families with young children. Given that the level of parental engagement in health behaviors is typically higher among families with young children versus those with older children and adolescents, the impact of COVID-19 may differ among these families as well. A clear understanding of how these changes have influenced the health behaviors, i.e., eating patterns, physical activity, sleep, and screen time, among families with young children is needed to inform family-based health promotion interventions that are relevant to the post-COVID-19 context.",

Families were eligible to participate if they had at least one child between 18 months and 5 years of age at the time of registration for the study, lived within the Guelph-Wellington area in Ontario and parents had to be comfortable with English to respond to survey questionnaires. Parents provided written consent in their initial study visit. The Guelph Family Health Study had two pilot phases (phases 1 and 2), which began in 2014 and 2015, respectively, in advance of the launch of the full-scale study, which began in 2017. This study used data collected from an online survey administered between 20 April 2020 to 15 May 2020 among parent participants in the Guelph Family Health Study pilot phase 1 and 2 and full study. The survey was sent to 306 families, which included 552 parent participants (310 mothers and 242 fathers) and 406 children. Completed questionnaires were received from 254 families (response rate = 83%), which included data on 235 mothers, 126 fathers, and 310 children. The first parent to enroll in the study was defined as Parent 1. Only Parent 1 was prompted to answer questions about the participating child(ren). Among the families where only Parent 2 responded to the survey (n = 19), child data were not collected. Parents received a $20 grocery gift card for completing the survey. The study was approved by the University of Guelph Research Ethics Board ([REB14AP008 and REB14AP009]).",

In our sample, while parents expressed concern about the amount of screen time their children were getting, many parents also identified structural changes that made it challenging to limit their children's screen time such as using screens for children's online learning/schooling and the need to use screens to engage their children while they completed their paid work from home. Parents in our sample requested ideas of screen-free activities that they could do with their children as ways to reduce their children's screen time and increase their children's physical activity. Our results suggest that guidance and resources to help parents manage their children's screen time and physical activity during this time should acknowledge these structural challenges and should focus on balancing screen time with physically active, screen-free activities versus recommendations to meet screen time and movement guidelines.",

Roughly half of the parents and children whose eating had changed since the pandemic reported eating less fast food/take out. Many families also reported spending more time cooking, making more meals from scratch, eating with their children more often, as well as involving children more often in meal preparation. A survey of 300 adults in the US observed similar trends in cooking more from scratch and dining out less [26] . A 5-year longitudinal study by Larson et al. [27] demonstrated that involving adolescents in meal preparation appears to have a lasting positive influence on diet quality as well as the enjoyment of cooking in young adulthood. These healthful meal preparation habits may result in families nurturing healthy eating and meal preparation habits from a young age. As requested by parents in our sample, resources should be provided to help families with young children continue these positive behavior changes as COVID-19 physical distancing restrictions are lifted, parents return to work outside the home and children return to school. In addition, it will be important to measure how these meal preparation and routines change over time as COVID-19 restrictions are lifted in order to identify which families may need additional supports to sustain children's engagement in meal preparation.",

Parents surveyed during a COVID-19 poll reported an increase to 6.7 out of 10 [29] , which is similar to the mean stress level found in our sample. Children in this sample seem to be largely protected from fears of COVID-19, as indicated by nearly 50% of respondents saying their child was experiencing \"very little\" worry and only 7% reporting a high concern. It is possible that other stressors such as changes in routines, social isolation from friends, and adjusting to online schooling may be present, but were not captured in our survey. Some families reported that their children were misbehaving and acting out more often since the pandemic. It could be possible that some children are misbehaving in response to the stress associated with the abrupt shift in their day-to-day routines. In past public health crises, longer durations of quarantine were associated with worsening mental health [30] and so it will be important to assess changes in family-level stress over time. Considering the physiological impact of stress on body function [31] alongside the increased risk of chronic diseases [32] , minimizing family stress should continue to be a top priority in COVID-19 response plans and simultaneous efforts made to reduce the chances of such adversities.",

            "text": "Limited financial or food resources are substantial stressors that many Canadians may face during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many Canadians have experienced reduced work hours or job loss during the pandemic and parents' ability to work is further complicated by school and child-care center closures. In our sample, approximately 20% of families reported concerns about paying their mortgage, rent, or other bills on time over the next six months. Job stability and financial concerns were also identified in the open-ended responses as key stressors among families. Our study also found that approximately 8% of families reported concerns about having enough money to purchase food for their family over the next six months. This is slightly lower than the national estimate of 12% of families experiencing food insecurity [33] . Our sample consists of a large proportion of families with relatively high household income, which may explain these lower levels of food security concerns. Canadian food banks have experienced a 20% increase in demand, with some areas such as Toronto experiencing a 50% increased demand [34] ; a doubling of global food insecurity is predicted by the end of 2020 as a result of COVID-19 [35] . Despite reports of panic-shopping in the early days of the pandemic [3] , Canada has a robust food supply system and government officials have assured the public that there is no anticipated food shortage as a result of COVID-19. These public messages may have helped to reassure parents in this sample, leading to a lower concern for food security observed in this study. Given that families with fewer financial and food resources are especially hard-hit in bio-emergencies [36] , a focus is needed on the long-term impact of COVID-19 among low-income families and on policies that ensure all Canadian families have adequate financial resources to weather these shocks to our economic system. While our study provides an early understanding of the impact that COVID-19 may have on the health and wellbeing of families in Canada, some limitations should be considered when interpreting our results. First, our sample was predominantly Caucasian and roughly 56% had a household income over $100,000, which limits the generalizability of our results to lower-income and racial minority families. Second, all data were self-reported by parents and included parent perception of behavior change (vs. direct measure). The fact that 87% of parents reported an increase in their children's screen time, which is not typically considered a desirable behavior, may however suggest that our results were not substantively influenced by social desirability bias. Finally, our study did not assess health outcomes, so it is unknown how the stressors and health behaviors assessed in this study are associated with family health status.",

            "text": "Among this sample of 254 families with young children, we found that the majority of families reported increased screen time and decreased physical activity since COVID-19 physical distancing restriction implementation. Over half of the families also reported changes to their eating habits and meal routines with some of those changes likely leading to improved diet quality, such as eating more meals from scratch, while others would be expected to lead to lower quality diets, such as eating more snack foods. Parents reported moderately high levels of stress; challenges related to balancing work with the added responsibility of homeschooling, concerns over contracting the COVID-19 virus, employment, and financial instability were identified as key stressors affecting families since the pandemic. Longitudinal research is needed to understand the impact of these behavior changes and stressors on health and weight-related outcomes among families. Our results suggest that COVID-19 response plans should include a focus on ensuring adequate income, minimizing family stress, and supporting healthful eating, activity, and screen-time behaviors among all Canadian families.
