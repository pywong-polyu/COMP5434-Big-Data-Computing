In this paper, we review the roles and impact of machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) on the UK financial services industry. We survey the current AI/ML landscape in the UK. ML has had a considerable impact in the areas of fraud and compliance, credit scoring, financial distress prediction, robo-advising and algorithmic trading. We examine these applications using UK examples. We also review the importance of regulation and governance in ML applications to financial services. Finally, we assess the performance of ML during the Covid-19 pandemic and conclude with directions for future research.",

According to Chakraborty and Joseph (2017) , ML systems comprise five components: (i) a problem, (ii) a data source, (iii) a model, (iv) an optimization algorithm, and (v) validation and testing. The ideal situations for ML are those that require extracting patterns from noisy data or sensory perception. The four main drivers of the growth in ML include: (i) the transition from physical to electronically stored data, (ii) improvements in memory and computing speed, (iii) easier access to data due to the Internet, and (iv) low-cost high-resolution digital sensors (Buchanan, 2019) .",

Table 1 displays the number of AI firms and AI-Fintech firms in 2020 by country according to region. Firms are categorized as belonging to either AI or Fintech, based on the Crunchbase category groups. Table 1 shows that the highest number of AI firms and AI-Fintech firms are located in the USA, followed by the UK, India, and Israel. China, Canada, and Germany also have a high number of AI firms. India's national AI strategy has focused on the social sector (i.e. health, education, agriculture, smart cities, and smart mobility) and AI investment leapt from US$44 million in 2016 to US$77 million in 2017. 9 The Israeli AI sector raised close to $2 billion in 2018 and is growing rapidly. Many Israeli AI entrepreneurs have a strong military background, and as a result have more extensive hands-on experience working with AI, image processing, and data science than many other international entrepreneurs. The main AI technologies in Israel include machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, natural language processing, robotics, and speech recognition. 10 Table 2 provides a more granular comparison of the UK and US AI and Fintech markets. The headquarters for AI and Fintech firms is tabulated for both countries. We observe that UK AI and Fintech firms are much more geographically concentrated than those in the US. Most UK AI firms are headquartered in the south of the nation, with London accounting for nearly three-quarters of AI headquarters, followed by Cambridge. Fintech firms are concentrated in London (74.7 per cent) followed by Manchester (1.6 per cent). In the US, the picture is very different. California is the preferred headquarter location for both AI and Fintech firms (44.5 per cent and 29.2 per cent, respectively). New York is the second most popular location (with 14.2 per cent and 17.2 per cent, respectively). California is the preferred choice due to proximity to Silicon Valley firms, and New York also has the advantage of proximity to Wall Street firms.",

The financial services industry is the biggest spender on AI services outside of the technology sector (Citi, 2018) . In 2019, the Bank of England (BoE) and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) surveyed 300 financial market participants (including banks, trading platforms, and fund managers). Of the respondents, 14 66 per cent said they currently employ ML and often in several areas (Bank of England, 2019) . According to respondents, ML is used in both front-and back-office settings, fraud prevention, anti-money-laundering (AML), and customer service situations. The median firm surveyed by BoE/FCA uses ML applications in two company areas, and this adoption is expected to double over the next 3 years. The survey finds that many firms are now deploying ML in advanced stages, with the most prominent in the banking and insurance areas. Until recently, hedge funds and high-frequency trading firms were the main users of AI in finance, but applications have now spread to other areas, including banks, regulators, Fintech, and insurance firms. Within the financial services industry, AI applications include algorithmic trading, credit risk assessment, wealth management, debt collection, cyber risk, portfolio construction and optimization, model validation and back-testing, robo-advising, virtual customer assistants, market impact analysis, 14 The survey received 106 responses out of 300 surveyed. regulatory compliance, and stress testing. In this section, we discuss four specific areas in which AI/ML is currently changing the financial services industry, namely (i) fraud detection and compliance; (ii) credit risk analysis and prediction of financial distress; (iii) banking chatbots and robo-advisory services; and (iv) algorithmic trading.

In the same report, 69 per cent of CEOs in financial services state they are extremely concerned about cybercrime (compared with 61 per cent across other sectors). According to the FCA, UK banks spend \u00a35 billion a year combating financial crime. 15 In the UK between 2015 and 2016, there was a 66 per cent increase in the number of reported cases of payments-related fraud. 16 Substantial fines have been imposed upon financial institutions for failing to stop financial fraud. As a result, banks have turned to AI/ML techniques to improve their operations and regulatory compliance. For example, PayPal has used ML to reduce its fraud rate to just 0.32 per cent compared with the industry average of 1.32 per cent. 17 However, fraud detection involves more than just a checklist of risk factors. Fraud is a latent variable and, compared to making accurate predictions of shopping decisions, it is more difficult to identify possible financial fraud. This is because retailers have access to full customer transaction histories (Bauguess, 2017; Buchanan, 2019) . Prior to the widespread adoption of ML, a rules-based approach has been the preferred approach to AML monitoring. ML produces a more efficient, accurate approach to AML monitoring (Proudman, 2019) . Fraud detection systems include ML techniques that actively learn and calibrate both real and potential security threat responses. Anomalous behaviours are then flagged for further investigation.",

First, there are few large public datasets that can be used to predict money laundering.

This may not be sophisticated enough to detect complex transactions (van Liebergen, 2017 In response to the \u00a31.2 billion money laundering fine imposed on HSBC in 2012, the bank adopted the Google cloud ML for use in its AML activities. In 2016, Lloyds Banking Group partnered with US-based AI startup Pindrop to combat unusual financial activity and fraud. Pindrop's ML technology is called 'phoneprinting', a system which analyses 147 unique human voice features to detect fraudulent activity, like a vocal fingerprint. Lloyds Banking Group was the first European organization to use 'phoneprinting' and it uses the technology across the Lloyds, Bank of Scotland, and Halifax networks. In the US, it has been used to detect over 80 per cent of fraudulent activity. 20 Incorporated in 1997, UK-based Eckoh is valued at \u00a3163 million 21 and is quoted on the Alternative Investment Market. Eckoh uses interactive voice response as part of its audio tokenization for secure phone payments. It also uses text recognition for chat payments. For Eckoh, ML utilization has improved timeliness, data security, and efficiency as well as regulatory requirements, minimizing the potential for fraud. Privately held London-based SiloBreaker applies ML and textual analysis to identify security threats. SiloBreaker uses unstructured data extracts from across the internet, including the dark web. The data extracted covers blogs, social media, and news. In terms of output, SiloBreaker's output directly helps financial services firms.

Credit risk analysis is used for mortgage, auto, credit card, and personal loans. Durand (1941) first introduced discriminant statistical analysis to distinguish between good and bad loans. In the financial services industry, most consumer loans are decided based on automated credit. Early uses of ML approaches in credit scoring include Makowski (1985) and Desai et al. (1996) . The 2007-8 financial crisis revealed weaknesses in established credit risk management techniques. Credit scoring lends itself to different ML approaches, such as supervised learning to construct consumer credit risk profiles. Specific ML techniques to assess credit risk profiles include tree-based classifiers, random forest models, radial basis functions, and support vector machines. Davis et al. (1992) apply two ML methods, specifically the Gammerman and Thatcher (1990) 'G&T' Bayesian inference model and neural networks, to Bank of Scotland credit card data. After the 1980s, logistic regression and linear programming were the mainstays of credit risk analysis (Thomas, 2000) . 23 Neural networks and support vector machines (SVMs) complement traditional methods because they provide the capability to model curvature and non-linearity of data. SVMs are supervised learning algorithms that are applied in image recognition and text categorization and increase accuracy and credit scoring reliability (Bellotti and Crook, 2009) .",

Forecasts are more adaptive and can respond to the dynamics of changing credit cycles as well as the absolute levels of default rates (Khandani et al., 2010) . Khandani et al. (2010) use classification and regression trees (CART) to construct credit-risk forecasts. CART is a type of predictive algorithm in ML, and in this context puts input variables through a recursive sequence of simple binary relations to predict delinquencies and defaults. CART is able to detect the nonlinear interactions between input variables. Khandani et al. (2010) find that ML forecasts yield savings of between 6 and 25 per cent of total losses. ML applications in credit market default prediction are gaining a wider audience. ML can be used to appraise character and reputation variables when assessing future payment behaviour. Using 250,000 purchases from a German e-commerce company, Berg et al. (2020) analyse ten digital footprints variables for default prediction. They find that digital footprints complement credit bureau information, affecting access to credit and reducing default rates. They find that digital footprints work equally well for un-scorable as well as for scorable customers. For customers with good digital footprints, default rates drop significantly after adoption of the digital footprint.",

However, logistic regression misses the highly non-linear influence that variables such as unemployment have on borrower behaviour. A critical issue arises because the highly non-linear relationship between borrower behaviour and risk factors throws previous conclusions drawn from linear mortgage models into doubt. Sirignano et al. (2021) apply DL (specifically neural networks) to model mortgage credit and prepayment risk. Using a dataset of 120 million mortgages between 1995 and 2014, which represents 70 per cent of all US mortgages, they find a stronger relation between housing finance markets and the macroeconomy than previously thought. The output of their model represents conditional probabilities of different mortgage states (current, 30-days late, prepaid, foreclosed, etc.). The improved forecasts can help improve mortgage-backed security valuation, especially when facing adverse macroeconomic conditions. Findings can also have huge social implications as well. Along with logistic regressions, Fuster et al. (2020) use ML technology to examine the distributional implications of better statistical technology. They also use US mortgage data (10 million between 2009 and 2013) and find that ML methods produce improvements in predictive powers. Fuster et al. (2020) examine how risky and less risky borrowers are distributed across societally important categories such as race, income, and gender, finding increased disparities in certain consumer outcomes. Under ML predictions, white, non-Hispanic groups experience lower estimated default propensities and black and Hispanic borrowers face larger charges and are less likely to gain from the new technology.",

On the other hand, a Type II error predicts a firm is going to be in distress, but it turns out to be fine. Clearly, the Type I error is the costlier mistake to the financial institution and exacerbates enterprise risk. It is also very serious and costly from a regulator's point of view. Liang et al. (2018) specifically address lowering the Type I error issue. They introduce a classifier ensemble principle, which is designed to reduce the occurrence of Type I errors. The classifier ensemble principle uses a 'divide and conquer' approach, whereby a complex problem is broken down into small sub-problems. A specific classification technique (such as SVM, NN, or decision tree) is then applied to each sub-problem. Suss and Treitel (2019) find ML methods are superior to classical approaches for predicting bank distress in the UK and that ML techniques can benefit from financial regulation.",

Synthetic data is created when data points are used to generate a new, 'fake' dataset that was not obtained through direct observation. Crucially though, the synthetic dataset still retains the statistical patterns of the real, observed data set. As a result, synthetic data cannot be reverse engineered and, as a synthetic dataset, it does not fall under regulations such as general data protection regulation (GDPR) and the payment card industry data security standard (PCI). Consequently, consumer privacy is protected, and regulations are not violated, meaning that companies can make synthetic data available for research and profit, both within the company and externally. Only synthetic data will ever leave a company's firewall; all the real data remain safe and secure within. UK platform Synthesized is an example of the growing area of synthetic transactional data. It provides synthetic data for testing internal systems, claim prediction performance, bias mitigation, and privacy compliant data.",

Qubits are able to process four values at any given time and allow the computer to parallel process information. This means that qubits can perform millions of calculations instantly.
