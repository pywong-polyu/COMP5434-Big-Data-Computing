Diagnostic technologies have played a key role in this response since the beginning of the pandemic.

Historically, use of antibody titers to measure systemic immunity has been constrained by an incomplete understanding of the relationship between antibodies and immunity, the lack of international standards for antibody concentration to enable cross-study comparisons, and insufficient clinical data to allow for the development of robust antibody-immunity models.",

For direct detection of the virus in the airways, a plethora of nucleic acid amplification assays (including PCR assays) and viral antigen assays have been developed. These tests have proven to be important elements of clinical diagnosis and disease management strategies.

Prior to widespread molecular testing and vaccination, these assays were sometimes used to also diagnose infection by SARS-CoV-2. The rationale for this approach was that the presence of antibodies against a novel virus, especially IgM antibodies, without prior history of infection could be used to diagnose current infection if coupled with concordant clinical symptoms. However, this diagnostic approach was largely abandoned early in the pandemic with the rapid growth and easy availability of antigen and nucleic acid testing (NATs). Nevertheless, serological testing still found some uses for epidemiological monitoring and outbreak control in certain populations.",

While vaccination provided a significant impact on the extent and severity of infections in most cases, an inevitable decay in that protection was expected based upon prior experience with vaccines. However, the character of that decay and the effective duration of protection varies widely between vaccines and individuals, and the community impact of the loss of protection remains unknown. Accordingly, there is an ongoing debate about the utility, need and timing of booster doses of vaccine to maintain immune protection against the virus, a debate that has intensified with the emergence of different variants of the original strain. To understand and accurately portray an individual's response to vaccination to help them make individualized decisions with the best available knowledge, quantitative antibody tests are needed that can sensitively measure the antibody levels generated by the vaccine, natural infection, or a combination of the two. But while sensitivity, specificity, and repeatability are essential, rapid results and ease of administration (including both sample matrix and testing location) are also desirable characteristics of any test that is expected to be widely used.",

The technology behind most of these immunoassays could be categorized as either lateral flow tests (LFT) or enzyme linked immunoassays (ELISA). LFTs are simple to use and require a small amount of blood but most accurate LFTs require a venipuncture to obtain a serum or plasma sample for the test. More recently, a few serological LFTs have been developed that can use fingerstick blood samples. Examples of commercially available LFTs are InBios' SCoV-2 Detect IgG Rapid Test 2 and Access Bio's CareStart COVID-19 IgM/IgG 3 . Despite their ease of use and rapid turnaround of results, a challenge of LFTs is their lack of quantitation and inherently lower sensitivity compared to laboratory ELISAs 4 . The sensitivity limitation is due to the absence of enzyme amplification of the signal, and the lack of washing steps between reactions to separate the reactant chemicals. Nonetheless, LFTs play a significant role in diagnostics because of their low cost, speed, and ease of use.",

It combines the benefits of LFT (simplicity, low sample volume, cost, and speed) and ELISA (sensitivity, specificity, precision, quantitation, and reliability). The Brevitest platform consists of a sample processing unit (SPU) that runs individual tests on disposable test cartridges. The SPU is a small robotic device that is fully automated and interacts with a central analysis and database system that runs in the cloud (the Brevitest Cloud). It uses a proprietary cartridge that contains reagents required to perform all ELISA steps and uses heat and moving magnets to control the reaction process. When the reactions are complete, the SPU measures the change in color in the indicator reagent resulting from the last step of the ELISA process. The raw optical readings are securely transmitted to the Brevitest Cloud for analysis and processing before the result is made available to the patient and physician in real-time. We have previously published the use of this platform to detect the presence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 secretory IgA in saliva. 9 Brevitest has developed and validated an assay to quantify SARS-CoV-2 anti-RBD IgG antibodies in fingerstick blood in less than 15 minutes on its proprietary platform.

Even if the use case makes class determination somewhat easy (e.g., focus on IgG for vaccine development), the question of target antigen remains challenging. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, for instance, do we want antibodies that bind to a specific viral component (e.g., the spike protein)? Given a component, do we want to bind to any segment or a specific one (e.g., S1)? Given a segment, do we want to bind to any domain or a specific one (e.g., RBD)? And what happens when mutations occur, causing a change in the potential binding sites? 2. How should we measure? Most antibody assays used today are simple lateral flow tests that give a binary result (+/-). LFTs are widely administered because they are easy to use (some requiring only a fingerstick), but they lack the sensitivity and precision needed to provide clinicians with a tool for determining immune status. There are semi-quantitative assays that can provide better information, but they typically require large samples of venipuncture blood, thus making widespread adoption difficult and unattractive to many patients. And, finally, there has until recently not been an international standard for antibody units, so semi-quantitative tests were of little utility when trying to assess community-wide immunity.",

However, further research has found that binding antibodies against the RBD domain are also strongly correlated with protection against COVID-19, perhaps due the neutralizing effect of competitive antibody binding that interferes with the binding of the spike protein to the ACE-2 receptor.",

But to implement this improvement, a testing technology is needed that can deliver quantitative results in WHO standard units of BAU/mL with sufficient precision at the point of care from a convenient, patient-friendly sample in a rapid time frame. Brevitest measures antibodies against the RBD part of the spike protein, which have been shown to be highly correlative with neutralizing activity. 19 In a recently published study, researchers analyzed the association between the concentration of certain antibodies and protection against SARS-CoV-2 quantified as vaccine effectiveness, that is the reduction in the rate of symptomatic infection for vaccinated vs. unvaccinated subjects. 18 In the study, binding and neutralizing antibodies at 28 days after the second dose were measured in infected and uninfected vaccine recipients, with antibody concentrations reported using the WHO reference standard. A vaccine effectiveness of 50% against symptomatic infection with majority Alpha (B.1.1.7) variant of SARS-CoV-2 was achieved with 95% confidence (VE50@95) at a concentration of anti-RBD antibodies of 109 BAU/mL. 18 In the Brevitest assay, this number was used to set the cutoff difference between \"Low\" and \"High,\" with values below the LOD reported as \"None Detected.\" Figure 3 shows the cutoffs of the Brevitest assay. Thus, the results of the Brevitest Quantimmune\u2122 COVID-19 IgG Antibody Test can be used to estimate the level of protection in a clinical setting.",

Figure 3A , the cutoff of 109 BAU/mL differentiates a low and a high sample. Figure 3B presents the LOD ( The availability of rapid, quantitative serology in a point-of-care setting from a fingerstick that can assess the level of immune protection on an individual and community basis is unprecedented and could have profound impact on the response to pandemics such as COVID-19. For instance, in the administration of vaccine boosters, public health officials and vaccine developers have typically recommended a booster after a specific time. Current recommendation for mRNA vaccines, for example, is to get a booster after 6 months. However, this \"fixed booster time\" approach can be suboptimal for patients (particularly elderly ones) who tend to lose their immunity faster than 6 months. In addition, for many people vaccination against COVID-19 confers 12 months or more of protection. For that segment of the vaccinated population, it could be optimal to defer a booster until their immunity falls below a threshold. Such a deferral could have multiple benefits: it could extend the overall period of protection for that patient, perhaps generate a stronger and more specific secondary response, and allow for better use of limited vaccine supplies. Figure 4 presents data taken from the Brevitest clinical validation study, showing only subjects who received an mRNA vaccine (Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech). While the dataset is relatively small (n=73), more than 12% of subjects were below the VE50@95 level of 109 BAU/mL prior to the 6-month recommended booster date, suggesting they could have a protection gap if they were to wait to boost. On the other hand, more than 31% of subjects had antibody levels above VE50@95, suggesting that they still had residual immunity, at least against the B.1.1.7 variant, and might extend their period of immune protection by deferring a booster. While such decisions should always be made in consultation with a clinician, this approach could be a helpful guide for those trying to manage patient immunity.",
