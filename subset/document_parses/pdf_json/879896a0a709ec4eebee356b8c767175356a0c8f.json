Here we show that RTX performs comparably to the other assays sanctioned by the CDC and validated in kit format. We demonstrate two modes of RTX use -(i) dye-based RT-qPCR assays that require only RTX polymerase, and (ii) TaqMan RT-qPCR assays that use a combination of RTX and Taq DNA polymerases (as the RTX exonuclease does not degrade a TaqMan probe). We also provide straightforward recipes for the purification of this alternative reagent. We anticipate that in low resource or point-of-need settings researchers could obtain the available constructs from Addgene or our lab and begin to develop their own assays, within whatever regulatory framework exists for them.",

The three assays target three different regions within the nucleocapsid phosphoprotein (N) gene near the 3'-end of the ~30 kb viral genome. In particular, N1 primers (Table 1 ) amplify a 72 nt long region from position 28287 to 28358 of the genome (GenBank Accession No. MN985325.1). The N2 primers produce a 67 bp amplicon from the genomic position 29164 to 29230. Meanwhile, the N3 primers amplify a 72 nt long region from genomic position 28681 to 28752. All reaction mixes were assembled on a cold-block and directly transferred to a real-time PCR machine programmed to cycle through the steps depicted in Table  3 . Melt curve analysis was included after PCR amplification in order to distinguish target amplicons from spurious products. Representative results of SARS-CoV-2 RT-qPCR tests performed using synthetic RNA templates and only RTX or RTX Exo-DNA polymerases are depicted in Figures 1 and 2 . Figure 1 .

TaqMan qRT-PCR reaction set up shown in Table 4 was used for assembling CDC SARS-CoV-2 N1, N2, and N3 assays using either RTX buffer or ThermoPol buffer. Control reactions lacking RTX polymerase were set up using the same recipe except RTX was replaced with water. All reaction mixes were assembled on a cold-block and directly transferred to a real-time PCR machine programmed to cycle through the steps depicted in Table 5 . To compare the RTX-based TaqMan qRT-PCR with qRT-PCR performed using commercial master mix, duplicate reactions ( Table 6 ) were set up using TaqPath\u2122 1-Step RT-qPCR Master Mix, CG (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). All reactions were assembled on cold block and then incubated at room temperature (25 \u00b0C benchtop) for 2 min prior to being loaded on a realtime PCR machine set to cycle through the steps indicated in Table 7 . The results with either a viral RT (in TaqPath TM commercial mastermix) or RTX are summarized in Table 8 . As can be seen, RTX-based TaqMan assays are of comparable sensitivity and specificity to the gold standard TaqPath assay. While all three RTX-based TaqMan assays performed in ThermoPol buffer consistently yielded Cq values, these were somewhat delayed compared to Cq values obtained with the commercial TaqPath\u2122 Master Mix. In contrast, RTX-based TaqMan assays when executed in RTX buffer yielded Cq values that were closer to Cq values obtained with the commercial mastermix. Perform IMAC column purification in a cold room or allow gravity flow to occur in a refrigerator. Prepare Ni-NTA agarose columns with final column volume (CV) of 1 mL. Apply the clarified lysate from 1 L of expressed culture to a previously equilibrated column and collect the flow-through. Wash column with 20 CV Equilibration Buffer and collect the flow-through. Wash column with 5 CV Wash Buffer and collect flow-through. Elute RTX from column with 5 mL Elution Buffer and transfer to a dialysis cassette with appropriate molecular weight cut-off. Dialyze eluate into 2 L of Ni-NTA Dialysis Buffer for 3-4 hours at 4\u02daC. Then dialyze eluate into a second 2 L of Ni-NTA Dialysis Buffer overnight at 4\u02daC.",
