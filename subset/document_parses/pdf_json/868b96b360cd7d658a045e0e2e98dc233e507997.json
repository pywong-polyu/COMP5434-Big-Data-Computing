The fully vaccinated group received the first dose of the vaccine earlier than the partially vaccinated group (Fig. S1) , and we cannot exclude that the differences observed between these two groups could be explained by the vaccination priority given to older and more complex patients. Selection bias from the general population was not likely to have occurred: the sample appeared to be representative of the population of patients deceased with COVID-19 and of the vaccine types used in Italy. All cases included were homogeneous in terms of health care facilities, being all in-hospital deaths, and the clinical records database used represents a random sample of all COVID-19 deaths in which all Italian regions are represented. Access to vaccination was uniform in the entire country, with large availability of vaccine doses in all regions. The timeframe of our analysis also excluded the first wave of the pandemic, when the burden on health care facilities in terms of hospitalizations and admissions to intensive care units was higher and the system suffered major stress.",
