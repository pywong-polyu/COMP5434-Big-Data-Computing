Treatment of IMIDs has developed rapidly in the past few years owing to better molecular profiling and the use of targeted interventions that neutralize disease-specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. In RA, the inhibition of TNF and IL-6R is effective, whereas SpA responds to inhibition of TNF and IL-17A. In CD and UC, TNF and IL-23 are the main effector cytokines. PsO is responsive to inhibition of TNF, IL-17A and IL-23, while inhibition of IL-4 and IL-13 works in AD 1 (Fig. 1 ). Despite differences in the target organs and the cytokine repertoires among individual IMIDs, commonalities exist, which are reflected by an exaggerated and sustained innate and adaptive immune response. In many forms of IMID, independent of the target organ or whether they are initiated via T helper 1 (T H 1), T H 17 or T H 2 cell activation, infiltration of target tissues with large numbers of innate immune cells such as granulocytes and inflammatory macrophages is a hallmark.",

Targeting IL-23 and IL-4/ IL-13 does not increase the risk for viral, bacterial or fungal infections, while inhibition of IL-17A only shows a signal for Candida species but not for viral infection. Targeting TNF and IL-6 increases the risk of bacterial infections but has lesser effects on viral infections (except for hepatitis B activation). Notably, although the incidence of influenza and the risk of developing complications from influenza infection are higher for patients with RA and CD, no signal associated with cytokine inhibitors was found 6 . Also, patients with RA or CD achieve normal immune responses to influenza vaccination when treated with anti-TNF agents, further supporting the concept that the effector cytokines induced by SARS-CoV-2 and targeted for treatment of IMIDs are critical for the inflammatory response but not for viral clearance 7 . Viral clearance seems to primarily depend on other cytokines such as IL-15, type I interferons and IFN\u03b3.",

Potential risk and benefits of cytokine inhibition need to be carefully addressed in order to recommend whether to continue or stop such treatments. Although at first sight cytokine inhibition might be considered as 'immune suppression' and therefore harmful in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, these compounds neutralize individual mediators of the inflammation cascade rather than leading to broad immune www.nature.com/nri suppression. On the other hand, cytokine inhibitors may mitigate the hyperinflammatory state, which is part of the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19. Indeed, studies using IL-6R and IL-6 inhibitors in COVID-19 have just been launched. Hence, approaches that do not affect viral clearance but inhibit hyperinflammatory host responses may exert beneficial effects in COVID-19.",

Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitors, which target JAK1 and JAK3, developed for treatment of RA, CD and PsO show an increased risk for herpes zoster reactivation. Targeting JAK1 and JAK3 affects the function of several cytokines that are involved in antiviral responses such as type I interferons, IL-2, IL-15, IL-21 and IFN\u03b3. Hence JAK1/JAK3 inhibitors could theoretically inhibit the clearance of SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, JAK2 inhibition appears to block viral entry of SARS-CoV-2 and IL-17-induced cytokine activation 9 . Notably, IL-6 and GM-CSF, which are both induced by SARS-CoV-2, partly or fully depend on JAK2 signalling, suggesting that JAK2 could be a target in treating hyperinflammatory response in COVID-19.",

Nonetheless, a critical analysis of the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the pathophysiology of COVID-19 and of the risk of viral infection during anti-cytokine therapy suggests that most cytokine inhibitors may not automatically put patients with IMIDs at higher risk of developing severe COVID-19. In accordance, most ad hoc recommendations from specialists in the fields of gastroenterology, rheumatology and dermatology do not support pre-emptively stopping anti-cytokine therapy if no signs of COVID-19 are present. Remarkably, some cytokine inhibition strategies are currently being tested for the treatment of COVID-19, and hydroxychloroquine, a long-known drug used for the treatment of IMIDs, seems to show efficacy in COVID-19 (REF. 10 ). Apart from these trials, IMID registers are currently being built up that will help to better understand the impact of COVID-19 in patients with autoimmune disease and to potentially uncover a protective role of certain cytokine inhibition strategies.
