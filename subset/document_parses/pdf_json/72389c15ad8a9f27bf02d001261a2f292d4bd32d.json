Using Italian administrative data on a sample of active contracts between 2009 and the second quarter of 2020, we show that, before the pandemic, a higher share of female compared to male, young compared to old and low educated compared to high educated workers is employed in non-essential activities. When we look at the change in hirings and separations, from the 9th week of 2020 -the time when first cases and deaths due to COVID-19 were recorded -, we find a pronounced drop in hirings and endings of fixed-term contracts. Layoffs and quits increase after the 9th week, and then decline significantly, reflecting the effects of government intervention. The lifting of the lockdown triggers a slow recovery of labor market flows. Young workers, those on temporary contracts, low-educated workers, those employed in the South and those with no opportunities of working from home experience a greater decline in separation probability, indicating that government policy partly protected them from the labor market impact of the recession. The decline in the separation probability for women is lower than that for men.",

As a consequence, global GDP growth in 2020 was \u22123.2 percent (IMF 2021), with considerable heterogeneity between advanced (\u22124.6 percent) and emerging economies (\u22122.1 percent). Governments responded to the economic downturn with encompassing packages of fiscal measures, ranging from transfers, loans, postponements of tax dues, to facilitating liquidity and access to credit for firms. Preventing or reducing the disruption of the labor market was among the main goals of government intervention, and the specific instruments adopted varied across countries, also in light of pre-existing labor market institutions. The implemented policy measures and pre-existing labor market conditions and institutions mediate the impact of the pandemic on jobs. For example, Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) compare the United Kingdom, the United States and Germany and show that the job losses were higher in the first two countries, which are characterized by more flexible labor markets.",

Italy was the first country in Europe to be hit by COVID-19 and the first to implement a national lockdown, which involved the definition of essential and non-essential economic activities, the former to be continued, the latter to be shut down. The lockdown was shortly after followed by two further policy measures relevant for labor market dynamics: a ban on layoffs and an ease of requirements to access short-time work (STW) compensation schemes. While the former is unique to Italy for its breadth, the latter is common to most European countries (see OECD 2020, for details on government policy responses across OECD countries).",

For each labor market flow, we provide graphical evidence of the cumulative weekly change for all workers and for different subgroups based on age, gender, macro area of work, type of contract (open-ended, apprenticeship or fixed-term/temporary), education level, and sector (essential vs non-essential activities). The descriptive evidence shows that, before the pandemic, the trend in cumulative labor market flows was in line with the average in the previous three years. When COVID-19 spread quickly around the country, starting from the 9th week of the year (i.e., from 26 February), there was a pronounced drop in net hirings, which halted only after the lockdown was lifted. We observe a similar pattern for hirings until week 13, after which they continued to decline at a faster rate, until their fall slowed down after the end of the lockdown. As to separations, we find that endings of fixed-term contracts declined except for a sudden increase at the end of the 13th week of the year, which corresponds to the end of March, when many contracts were not renewed given the weaker labor market conditions. Layoffs and quits increased right after the 9th week, and then dropped significantly. The evolution of layoffs reflects the policy introduced on 17 March, that explicitly forbids firms from laying off workers and, at the same time, eases the requirements to have access to STW compensation schemes. Before the policy was enacted,",

We do so both comparing the pre-and post-pandemic period and examining dynamic effects in each month. Workers on fixed-term relative to open-ended contracts, workers in the South relative to the North, low relative to high educated workers and those employed in occupations that cannot be performed at home compared to those that can, experience a higher drop in the separation probability after the pandemic compared to the period before it, showing that the policies implemented were able to protect these groups of vulnerable workers. We also find that female workers benefited less from the reduction in the separation probability compared to men. The result that women experienced a lower reduction in the separation probability is in line with Adams-Prassl et al. (2020) , who show that women have a higher likelihood to separate from their jobs than men. Given the higher concentration of women in temporary contracts and part-time positions, coupled with the nation-wide school closures, one could expect a harsher impact of the crisis on women, as highlighted by Alon et al. (2020) . However, Hupkau and Petrongolo (2020) , using data from the COVID-19 supplement of Understanding Society, report that job losses of women and men were of comparable size in the UK.",

Evidence using real-time survey data (Bick and Blandin 2020; Adams-Prassl et al. 2020; von Gaudecker et al. 2020; Galasso and Foucault 2020) , administrative data (Cajner et al. 2020 ) and a combination of both highlights the severe and unequal consequences of the pandemic recession on the labor market. A strand of this literature specifically focuses on how different categories of workers were affected by the pandemic (Blundell et al. 2020; Crossley et al. 2021; Bonacini et al. 2021; Cortes and Forsythe 2020) , with particular focus on age (Belot et al. 2021 ) and gender (Alon et al. 2020; Hupkau and Petrongolo 2020; Farr\u00e9 et al. 2020) . 1 We provide new evidence based on detailed administrative data on a sample of active, new and terminated contracts, coming from the Comunicazioni Obbligatorie, i.e. the compulsory information firms need to provide on their workforce. These data are highly reliable and less subject to measurement errors with respect to survey data. In addition, we can exploit a large sample size and a long time period to compare changes in labor market flows before and after the pandemic. Moreover, we can explore many dimensions of heterogeneity and provide an exhaustive picture of the unequal impact of COVID-19, distinguishing workers according to age, gender, education level, area of work, type of contract, sector and opportunity of remote work. We also assess the short run impact of a government policy that explicitly forbids layoffs and extends the generosity of STW compensation schemes. We show it was successful in taming layoffs -as expected -, but may also have reduced hirings. This lays the groundwork for a long term assessment of the impact of these policies on labor market dynamics. Finally, by showing how workers on different types of contracts and different degrees of employment protection are affected by the pandemic recession, we contribute to the literature that analyzes the margins of adjustment in the labor market in the presence of negative shocks (Izquierdo et al. 2017; Garin and Silv\u00e9rio 2019; Adamopoulou et al. 2020) .",

We keep only workers in the private sector in our analysis and we further exclude workers in agriculture and domestic workers, as information on these workers is less reliable.

Our data over-samples contracts held by workers in the age group 15-34 and under-samples contracts of workers on open-ended and full-time positions and contracts of workers in (1), reports the sample size of CICO, distinguishing total contracts and total workers (as workers can hold multiple contracts) by the end of the sample period. 5 Column (2) reports the number of private sector workers from INPS (excluding agriculture and domestic workers). Overall, our sample represents approximately 11.2% of the population of workers in Italy. The fact that contracts held by younger workers are over-represented, whereas more stable contractual arrangements -such as open-ended and full-time contracts -are underrepresented comes as no surprise given the sample selection described above. The data over-samples contracts stipulated in the last decade, which capture the first contract of new workers, who are therefore more likely to be young and on temporary positions. However, although not fully representative of the population of workers at a given point in time, the data allows us to compare flows between different years (e.g., the change in hirings or separations over time) and to contrast the distribution of workers in the subgroups of essential and non-essential activities, as one can believe the sampling bias would be orthogonal with respect to the allocation of workers across essential and non-essential activities. 6",

Following the diffusion of the virus in the North, two \"red zones\" were implemented, involving 11 municipalities in Lombardy and Veneto, that were effectively in lockdown. At the same time, many Northern regions opted to close schools, a measure that extended to the whole nation on 4 March. On 10 March the whole country went into lockdown. The decree establishing the nationwide lockdown also specified the activities that were deemed as essential and could continue to operate and those that were classified as non-essential and were forced to shut down. These activities were further specified with the decree of 22 March, which identified the sectoral codes that fell in either of the two groups (see Table A .1 in the Supplementary Material). Essential activities mainly include agriculture, some manufacturing, energy and water supply, transports and logistics, ICT, banking and insurance, professional and scientific activities, public administration, education, healthcare and some service activities. Non-essential activities, which coincide with shutdown sectors, include most of manufacturing activities, wholesale and retail trade, hotels, restaurants and bars, entertainment and sport activities. In light of these closures, the government adopted on 17 March a Decree Law that considerably increased worker's employment protection. Two main labor market policies were adopted:",

Figure 2 reports the cumulative change in net hirings, hirings, layoffs, endings of fixed-term contracts, quits and total separations for each week in the first two quarters of 2020 relative to the average of 2017-19 and for all workers, as from Eq. 1. Total separations are computed as an aggregate of layoffs, endings of fixed-term contracts and quits, while net hirings are the difference between the curves of hirings and total separations. The figure shows that net hirings were on a parallel trend before the onset of the pandemic, but after the 9th week (i.e. after the first cases and deaths were recorded), 11 there is a marked contraction, which is determined by a sharp decline in hirings and an increase in separations. Starting from week 12-13, separations begin to decline, too, as a consequence of the layoff ban, the COVIDrelated STW compensation scheme and the contraction in economic activity, which lowers job turnover. We observe that the decline is particularly marked for endings of fixed-term contracts. Until week 18 (i.e. the end of the strict lockdown) the slope of the decline in hirings is steeper than the decline in separations, therefore producing a continuing drop in net hirings. After week 18, when businesses began to return to a new normal, there is a change in the slope of net hirings as activations of new contracts started to recover, and separations continued to be below their levels in the past (as the ban on layoff and COVID-related STW were still in place). Overall, by the end of our observation period, we find a net change of \u22126 per 100 workers, determined by a change in hirings of \u221212.8 and in separations of \u22126.8, with respect to the average of 2017-19 and relative to week 8 of the year. 12 The large decline in job creation is a consequence of the pandemic recession and the subsequent lockdown of economic activities. It is possible that also the ban on layoffs had a negative effect on job creation, since it increased the firing cost virtually to infinity. 13 However, the graph shows that, when restrictions on mobility were lifted from week 18, net hirings started to return to their levels in the past, even in the presence of the layoff ban, mainly through a slowdown in the fall of cumulative hirings. Although this is only suggestive evidence, as it is impossible to clearly and separately identify the effect of the lockdown from that of the policy, it seems that the reduction in hirings associated with the layoff ban is smaller than that induced by the pandemic-related recession. Otherwise, we would not observe the change in the slope of hirings, once the non-pharmaceutical interventions are lifted. Figure 3 , panels A-F, shows the cumulative change in net hirings per 100 workers with the same characteristics between 2020 and the average 2017-19. Panel A reports the changes for different age groups and shows that the impact of the pandemic recession was harsher for young workers (age group 15-34) relative to middle-aged (35-54) and old workers (over 55). At the end of the second quarter, we find 10 fewer net hires per 100 11 Note that week 9 is also the week since when the layoff ban has applied retroactively. 12 Without the normalization in the 8th week, we have a net change of \u22125.6, determined by a change in hirings of \u221211.5 and a change in separations of \u22125.9 per 100 workers. 13 Kugler and Pica (2008) study the impact of increasing firing costs on worker flows and show indeed that it has a negative effect on hirings and separations, with a zero net employment effect overall. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 Week workers in the age group 15-34, relative to week 8, compared to 3.9 for both middle aged and old workers. Panel B reports results by gender and shows that the pandemic had a stronger impact on females. There were 7 fewer net hires for women compared to 5.3 for men per 100 workers. Panel C reports the cumulative changes by macro area, and shows that the impact was slightly larger for workers in the South and Centre (\u22126.7 and \u22126.4, respectively) than for workers in the North (\u22125.5): hence, although the health effects of the pandemic were more severe in the North during the first wave, the negative economic consequences were distributed across the whole country. Panel D shows the disproportionate impact of the pandemic on fixed-term contracts, with 17 fewer cumulative net hires per 100 workers, as opposed to an almost unchanged trend for open-ended contracts (\u22120.3) and a lower decline for apprenticeships (\u22123.5). Panel E reports the impact across different education groups, and shows that low educated workers are suffering more the negative consequences of the recession: workers with lower secondary and upper secondary education experience a change in net hirings of \u22127.2 and \u22125.5, respectively, relative to \u22122.5 for university graduates. Finally, panel F reports the change for essential and non-essential activities, i.e. for open and shutdown sectors, showing that the latter had a larger decrease in net hirings (\u22127.6) than the former (\u22124.3). The impact on non-essential activities is a consequence of business closures, as those sectors were not operating. The impact on essential activities reflects the general contraction in economic activity and demand.",

            "text": "Layoffs Figure 5 reports the cumulative weekly change in layoffs for different subgroups (note that the scale on the vertical axis differs from the previous figures). Until the beginning of the pandemic recession, layoffs were on the same trend as those registered in the past. After the onset of the pandemic, we observe an increase in layoffs, which was particularly evident between weeks 9 and 12, and especially for workers on fixed-term contracts (panel D) and with low level of education (panel E). In week 12, the ban on layoffs together with the COVID-related STW compensation scheme came into force and we observe a steady decline in cumulative layoffs, until the end of our period of analysis, when the ban and the STW compensation scheme were still in place. Overall, this evidence suggests that, absent the policy, firms would have resorted to layoffs to cut labor costs, although it is difficult to separate the impact of the layoff ban from that of COVID-related STW compensation scheme. Which categories benefited the most from the policy? Panel A suggests that, if anything, younger workers experience a slightly lower reduction in layoffs with respect to middleage and old workers, but differences are small. Panel B displays differences by gender. The rise in layoffs hit both genders equally, but at the end of the observation period the cumulative decline in layoffs is higher for men (\u22121.3, as opposed to \u22120.8 for women). Geographic differences are more evident (panel C), with workers in the South benefiting from the increased employment protection legislation: we observe 2 fewer layoffs per 100 workers in the South, compared to \u22121.1 in the Centre and \u22120.7 in the North. We also report a different cumulative change for workers with open-ended contracts (\u22121.5) relative to fixed-term contracts (\u22120.6) and apprenticeships (\u22120.3) in panel D. A more pronounced decline is also observed for low-educated workers (panel E) and workers employed in nonessential activities (panel F), indicating that the policies aimed at preserving employment relationship helped these more vulnerable workers and more exposed sectors in coping with the consequences of the recession. Figure 6 reports the evolution of endings of fixed-term contracts. For all subgroups, we observe similar patterns: the trend in the cumulative change in endings is similar in the first 8 weeks of the year to that observed right before the pandemic, but for few exceptions. After the start of the pandemic, there is a constant decline in the number of endings with respect to the past three years, with the exception of week 13, which corresponds to the last week of March. The positive slope in week 13 is probably due to employers choosing not to renew temporary contracts, which were expiring in that week: the end of quarters is a frequent date for the ending of fixed-term contracts and, in fact, if we plotted the weekly instead of the cumulative change in endings of fixed-term contracts, we would observe similar increases at the end of each month, but less pronounced than the one at the end of the first quarter. The decrease in endings of fixed-term contracts is very likely to reflect the general decline in economic activity: the drop in aggregate demand generates a decrease in the Quits Figure 7 reports the evolution of quits. Voluntary quits display an increasing trend between weeks 9 and 12, right after the pandemic started, similarly to layoffs. Panel A shows striking differences by age groups: for older workers, the difference between quits in 2020 and in the past is always positive. Overall, by the end of the observation window, we find 0.5 more quits per 100 workers older than 55. This group of workers may have quitted their jobs at a higher rate to help their families cope with school closures and child care activities. At the same time, firms may have used quits as a way to anticipate retirement for some workers and cut labor costs. 14 We observe, instead, a decline in quits for other age groups. The exception is a slight increase in weeks 9-12 for workers aged 35-54, which can be again related to the impossibility of balancing work and family duties after school closures. Panel B shows that quits increased more for women right after the beginning of the pandemic and this may contribute to the less pronounced cumulative drop by the end of the second quarter. Quits increased in weeks 9-12 more in the South than in the rest of the country (panel C) and their drop compared to the past was smaller in the South by the end of the second quarter. Panel D shows that the decline in quits is less pronounced for open-ended contracts and apprenticeships compared to fixed-term contracts: this comes as no surprise as most open-ended contracts are held by workers older than 35. The decline in quits is similar for workers with lower secondary or upper secondary education, but higher in magnitude than that of university graduates (panel E), although, in weeks 9-12, low educated workers significantly increased their quitting rate relative to the past. Finally, panel F shows that the increase in quits right after the onset of the pandemic was higher in essential activities than in non-essential ones. Since business was continuing in essential activities, some workers may have been forced to quit their jobs because of school closures or for fear of contagion or firms may have used quits as an alternative to layoffs.",

When adding occupation and/or sector fixed effects, both estimates become statistically significant. Overall, the decline in the likelihood to separate is marginally larger in magnitude for occupations that cannot be performed from home. This result suggests that the layoff ban and the COVID-related STW compensation scheme proved effective in protecting workers that could not work remotely from losing their job. Figure 8 reports dynamic effects from Eq. 3. The figure shows that, before the pandemic started in February, workers in 2019-2020 were on a parallel trend relative to those in 2018-2019, as estimates are generally not statistically significant for months between July and December. After the pandemic started, we observe increases in the likelihood to separate, which are particularly evident for some categories of workers in February: age group 55+ in panel A, women in panel B, workers in the South in panel C, fixed-term contracts in panel D, low educated workers in panel E and workers in occupations that cannot be performed from home in panel F. From March on, when the layoff ban and the COVID-related STW compensation scheme were in place, these trends reverse and all categories of workers experience lower separation probabilities with respect to January, compared to the past. In particular, younger workers experience larger reductions in separation probability relative to older ones, as well as men relative to women, employees in the South relative to those in the North, workers on fixed-term relative to open-ended contracts, workers with lower and upper secondary education relative to workers with a university degree and workers in occupations that cannot be performed from home compared to those that can.",

            "text": "We show that, before the pandemic, a higher share of female compared to male, young compared to old and low educated compared to high educated workers is employed in nonessential activities. When looking at the change in hirings and separations and decomposing it by age, gender, macro area, type of contract (open-ended or fixed-term), education level, and group of activity (essential vs non-essential), we find that from the 9th week of the year -when the virus started to spread exponentially across the country -there was a pronounced drop in hirings. Endings of fixed-term contracts slightly declined after the 9th week, and more so after the 13th week of the year. On the contrary, layoffs and quits increased right after the 9th week, and then dropped, reflecting the effects of the ban on layoffs and the ease of access to STW compensation schemes. The decline in separations may also be linked to the recession-induced decrease in job creation. The ban on layoffs may have contributed to the decline in job creation as well, since the higher employment protection for workers may have decreased turnover. However, the fact that the drop in hirings slowed down by the end of the second quarter of 2020 suggests a more prominent role of the lockdown in determining the decrease in hirings. We further explore separations by examining how separation Notes. The figure reports estimates of Eq. 3 for different subgroups of workers in panels A-E. Regressions control for workers' observable characteristics: age, dummies for women, foreign workers, contract type (fixed-term or apprenticeship, open-ended excluded), full-time workers, education level (upper secondary or university, lower secondary excluded) and macro-area of work (Centre and South, North excluded). Depending on the subgroup, control variables change: in panel A, we do not control for gender; in panel B, for age; in panel C, for contract type; in panel D, for education; in panel E, for macro-area of work; in panel F, for occupations that can (cannot) be performed from home. Furthermore, both occupation and sector fixed effects are included in all regressions. Vertical lines are 95 percent confidence interval obtained from standard errors, clustered at the occupation-sector level probabilities change after the onset of the pandemic for different subgroups of workers. We find that young workers, those on temporary contracts, low-educated workers, those employed in the South and those with no opportunity of working from home experienced a bigger reduction in the separation probability, indicating that the layoff ban and the COVIDrelated STW compensation scheme offered them protection. Women instead experience a slightly lower reduction in the separation probability compared to men, and are more likely to separate with respect to the past immediately after the pandemic kicks in. While we focus on short-term outcomes and cannot account for changes in hours worked, our evidence contributes to the understanding of labor market and policy responses in the wake of the pandemic. The use of detailed administrative data allows us to separately analyze how hirings and separations -distinguishing between layoffs, endings of fixed-term contracts and quits -have evolved relative to normal times and how different categories of workers have been affected. Given the critical role of the ban on layoffs and the COVID-related STW compensation scheme in affecting labor market flows, it is important to monitor the labor market transitions now that these policies have been partially lifted, since they have protected some vulnerable workers the most.",
