In this commentary, we summarize four ways in which differentiated service delivery (DSD) for HIV treatment has been accelerated during COVID-19 in policy and implementation in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) -(i) expanding eligibility for DSD for HIV treatment, (ii) extending multi-month dispensing (MMD) and reducing the frequency of clinical consultations, (iii) emphasizing communitybased models and (iv) integrating/aligning with TB preventative therapy (TPT), non-communicable disease (NCD) treatments and family planning commodities. Discussion: Across SSA in 2020, countries both adapted and emphasized policies supporting DSD for HIV treatment in response to COVID-19. Access to DSD for HIV treatment was expanded by reducing the time required on ART before eligibility and being more inclusive of specific populations including children and adolescents, pregnant and breastfeeding women and those on second-and third-line regimens. Access to extended ART refills, or MMD, was accelerated across many countries. A renewed focus was given to out-of-facility community-based models of ART distribution. In some settings, there was acknowledgement of the need to integrate or align other chronic medications with ART. Conclusions: Adaptations to DSD for HIV treatment in response to COVID-19 have resulted in rapid policy change and in some cases, acceleration of implementation in SSA. As the COVID-19 pandemic evolves, there is a critical need to assess the impact of these adaptations and, where beneficial, ensure that policies implemented in response to COVID-19 become the new normal.",

Modelling work published in August 2020 emphasized the potentially catastrophic impact on AIDS-related mortality and HIV transmission if there was a six-month interruption in ART in Africa [2] . Programmatic data confirmed that while the global 2020 HIV targets would not be met, the total number of people on ART did not decline between April and September of 2020 [1] . The effect of COVID-19 on HIV programmes has most severely impacted HIV prevention, testing and initiation of new patients, whereas HIV treatment programmes have been fairly resilient with 26 million people worldwide on treatment as of June 2020 [1] .",

In addition, we emphasized the precedent for HIV programmes to adjust service delivery in emergency contexts.

While WHO supported DSD access for specific populations [38], many were either explicitly excluded or not specifically made eligible in country policies [39] . PEPFAR, in response to COVID-19, intensified their push for expanding eligibility to all populations, including those with co-morbidities, those who recently initiated treatment and to those with advanced HIV disease, specifically at least for MMD [40].",

South Africa's HIV guidance during COVID-19 emphasized this new eligibility criteria for urgent implementation [25] . In Malawi and Mozambique, the criteria for a suppressed viral load was removed in response to COVID-19, likely to overcome the challenge of poor [21, 22] . In Ethiopia, those on second-and third-line regimens, clinically unstable patients and all children and pregnant and breastfeeding women became eligible for 3MMD during COVID-19 [12] .

Community drug distribution points were emphasized in Uganda [31] to increase the proportion of people collecting ART outside of health facilities. In Eswatini [11] , adaptations to CAGs included CAG members being able to collect drug refills for their community (beyond just the people in their HIV CAG) including NCD, family planning and PrEP refills. Lay healthcare worker-managed community groups were developed in Kenya [16], specifically for adolescents, young people and sex workers. Adaptations were made to support lay healthcare workers distributing ART refills to community groups, often with a virtual psychosocial support component. In South Africa [25] , where ART refills were mostly limited to two months, guidance emphasized the acceleration of external pick-up points including ART refills from private pharmacies, community venues and lockers or \"pele boxes. \" Homedelivery of ART was endorsed by policy in Cote Ivoire (prioritized for those over 60 years of age), Ethiopia, Sierra Leone and South Africa.

However, remembering that DSD focuses on client preference and needs, COVID-19 related DSD acceleration should not result in a new one-size-fits all approach of MMD and community individual refills.
