Healthcare workers are one of the most vulnerable groups to psychological stress in pandemics especially COVID-19. In this cross-sectional study, we assessed depression, stress, and coping among a sample of Egyptian physicians using an electronic survey. It included demographic data; Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 Items (DASS-21); and Brief Resilient Coping Scale (BRCS). Results: We found that the majority of the sample were females (61.2%), in medical specialties (51.2%), and living with vulnerable family members (92.4 %). The majority (63%) suffered from severe or extremely severe depression, 77.6% had extremely severe anxiety, and 72% suffered from stress. BRCS showed that only 17.1% had high resilient coping. Female physicians had significantly higher depression, anxiety, and stress scores of DASS than male physicians (p = 0.001, < 0.001, and < 0.001, respectively). The anxiety scale was significantly higher in those with chronic diseases (p = 0.040) while the stress scale was lower significantly in those with higher academic degree (p = 0.034). Age had a significantly negative correlation with DASS anxiety (p = 0.031) and stress scores (p = 0.037). The BRCS score had a significantly negative correlation with the depression, anxiety, and stress scales of DASS (p = 0.018, 0.014, and 0.007 respectively). Conclusion: The COVID-19 pandemic has a negative impact on the psychological well-being of the studied Egyptian physicians. Prophylactic measures should be implemented to avoid development of psychiatric symptoms in physicians.",

In the SARS outbreak, healthcare workers suffered from fears of being infected, infecting family/friends, stigma, and high levels of stress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms [11] . This is evident in the COVID-19 pandemic due to many factors: limited knowledge and resources, unavailable treatment, conflicting media messages, and social distancing. Healthcare workers are one of the most vulnerable groups to psychological stress in pandemics. Moreover, with COVID-19, healthcare workers suffer from longer working hours and scarce personal protective equipment (PPE) [15] . In addition, they are challenged with deficient resource allocation to equally critical patients and rather impossible balance between their own needs being understaffed with the expanding number of patients. These pressures are intensified by time urgency and public and media scrutiny [6, 19] .",
