With machine learning, we witnessed an expansion of applying interpretation to a variety of tool sets and the continued concern about data security, privacy, and bias. With bioinformatics, there has been a massive increase in the use of single cell gene expression datasets, in line with the field of molecular and cellular biology as a whole. Drug outcome prediction techniques continue to be refined, and increasing complexity seen in global biobanks are providing richer datasets. However, the need to diversify the populations in these datasets still remains a priority.",

PHEICs are the WHO's highest level of alarm and set the stage for the year to come. Since 2009, there have been nine events assessed for potential PHEIC declarations with six formal declarations: the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, the 2014 polio decleration, the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the 2018 Kivu Ebola outbreak, and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [7] . COVID-19 is not the longest PHEIC (the 2014 polio PHEIC still remains in effect in 2021), but it does stand apart in its global impact. In March of 2021, global cases of COVID-19 had exceeded 126 million and caused 2.77 million deaths worldwide. The largest impacts have been seen in the United States and Brazil, with deaths in excess of 559,000 and 340,000 respectively as of April of 2021 [8] . Comparatively, the swine flu (H1N1) was estimated to cause 284,000 deaths worldwide (from a range of 150,000 to 575,000 deaths) [9] . Global cost estimates of the COVID-19 pandemic have been set at $28 trillion by the International Monetary Fund [10] , and the impact to the United States alone is estimated at $16 trillion [11] . This, unsurprisingly, has caused the COVID-19 pandemic to be labeled the worst global crisis since the Great Depression [12] .",

For context, since its discovery in 1976, there have been ~9,700 Ebola-related papers published [21] . According to LitCovid over the past year Publishers adopted several different techniques to help streamline the publication pipeline. The journal eLife announced it would cut back on requests for additional experiments during revisions, suspend revision deadlines, and require all submissions to post preprints to bioRxiv or medRxiv [22] . The Royal Society Open Publishing recruited a group of 700 reviewers who committed to reviewing fast-tracked COVID-19 papers in 24 to 48 hours [23] . Efforts to expedite the publication process were found to be very effective across the board. Typically, a biomedical manuscript takes a median of 100 days from submission to acceptance [24] . Studies found that the time between submission and publication for COVID-19 papers decreased by 49% on average [23] . Palayew et al. found there was a 6-day median time for submission to publication in the early stages of the pandemic [24] . This highlights the demand for the most recent data on COVID-19 and the lengths publishers went to ensure data reached scientists and medical professionals quickly.",

The sister subreddit, /r/COVID-19, was focused on the emerging science on the virus and had over 317k members. The science-focused /r/ COVID-19 subreddit had additional rules for sharing material and was more heavily moderated. The massive interest in pre-print servers would often be reflected in these communities, as members would share and discuss the latest pre-print manuscripts in parallel with the latest published papers. The enthusiasm for the science is a bright spot to appear from this pandemic, with younger generations expressing more interest in STEM careers [25] .

            "text": "For all the advancement and acceleration of the science focused on COVID-19, there were significant errors caused by removing some of the traditional guardrails in scientific publication. The website Retraction Watch, which monitors retracted manuscripts, has been tracking COVID-19 papers and noted 75 fully retracted papers, 11 retracted to journal error, four retracted and reinstated, and five flagged with expressions of concern [26] . Pre-print servers like medRxiv 3 and bioRxiv 4 were platforms to help accelerate publications and witnessed exponential growth during this pandemic [27] . However, concerns about medical preprints were validated as some papers went viral before there was adequate review [28] . There was a pre-print paper about seroprevalence in Santa Clara County that got national media attention when it first appeared on April 17 th , 2020 [29] . However, just a few days later, people were expressing serious concerns 1 https://reddit.com/r/Coronavirus 2 https://reddit.com/r/COVID-19 3 https://medrxiv.org 4 https://biorxiv.org about potential flaws in the study [30] , but only after it had captured the attention of the general public [31] . Traditional peer review should have addressed these concerns prior to publication, but the new and faster process may have led to more errors by reviewers and editors. Rushed and flawed papers were not the only concerning outcome from this pandemic. There are signs that the gender gap in science may be further exacerbated, as female scientists, particularly those with young dependents, reported significant declines in the time they could devote to their research over the past year, which could impact their careers for years to come [32] . A period of reflection will be needed to further identify what elements helped advance science during this pandemic, and what issues require repair or removal to prevent additional harm in the future. This sets the stage for the environment we encountered when beginning our survey of bioinformatics and translational informatics papers. COVID-19 caused tectonic shifts in how science and the world adjusted during a modern pandemic. Scientific information saw the arrival of new pathways for dissemination. While the impact COVID-19 has been profound, we do not want it to steal the spotlight from other notable papers and trends from the past year. After reviewing the MeSH term frequency results in Table 1 , we decided to organize the manuscripts we wanted to highlight into two categories: machine learning and bioinformatics.",

These distributed representations, i.e., embedding, are used to encode various modalities of data, including gene expressions [39, 40] , events [36] , images [33] , and other relational graph data [37, 41] . The embedding methods are data-driven representations that can capture semantic and contextual information and incorporate them into a numerical representation. However, the high dependency of data-driven methods on data quality and the detachment of domain knowledge and validation methods from the feature extraction process suggests a broad range of potential improvements for the research in this area.",

In this study, the authors use laboratory experiments to generate fluorescence imaging data of normal plasmodium falciparum cell growth. They first demonstrated the use of deep neural networks (DNN) to process this data into an interpretable quantitative feature that couples tightly with the cell cycle. Using this new analytical representation, they then show how disruptions to the cell cycle (by chemical agents, for example) can be easily identified in their new feature. The authors round out the study by using their DNN representation to accurately reveal the mechanisms of action of the chemical agents.

Similarly, other studies leveraged single-cell techniques to study populations of cells across time and space, from mapping pathway activation in response to stimuli [54] and contrasting expression profiles across developmental stages [55] to profiling chromatin accessibility across brain regions [56] .

The features informed a final model that was able to accurately predict drug response across multiple cancer cell lines, either as the IC50 sensitivity value or classification as sensitive/resistant.

Mediated expression score regression is a new approach that aims to quantify the contribution of variants to disease by calculating the proportion of disease heritability mediated by gene expression [57] . Although the absolute value is low, the authors found that a significant proportion of disease heritability from GWAS is mediated by gene expression in cis. Similarly, PhenomeXcan linked functional genomics and transcriptomics with trait-associated variation to connect genetically regulated gene expression with phenotype [58] . A deeper understanding of the relationship between genetic variation, gene expression, and phenotype will not only enable further improvements to variant effect prediction algorithms but will also generate useful hypotheses for future analysis. 2020 also saw the rise of whole-omics approaches to understanding SARS-CoV-2 infection. Ramlall et al. discovered a critical role for the complement system in COVID-19 through a hybrid analysis combining clinical data from EHRs with genomic data from the UK Biobank [59] . Given the urgency of the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers turned en masse to informatics and data-driven approaches to find possible therapeutics. Studies that integrated chemical informatics based lead prioritization were quite notable. Panda et al. conducted exhaustive molecular dynamics simulations to several compounds with activity against SARS-CoV-2's viral receptor binding domain [4] . The authors used available data in ChEMBL (a database of compound-target activities) to identify 38 drug-like compounds with activity against coronavirus targets. They then followed up with molecular dynamics models to identify the specific binding pockets and possible mechanisms of action. This type of rapid therapeutic hypothesis generation is made possible by the tireless work of informaticians over the past 20 years to structure, organize, and release data and analytical methods.",

However, despite the use of genetic risk scores and other forms of predictive modeling based on genomic data in other articles, discussion of diversity and health disparities is not at the forefront. In order to make equitable advances in healthcare moving forward, we must consider potential historical biases in the underlying datasets and prioritize the inclusion of underrepresented populations in modeling and validation efforts.

For science generally, we have witnessed unprecedented productivity, made possible by the groundwork laid by a generation of informaticians. In this review, we highlight some of the year's most influential and inspiring informatics work. These works address the most important challenges of our time: the pandemic, underrepresentation bias, highthrough mult-omics integration -among others. Even so, significant research gaps remain. Biases in biomedical data limit our understanding of disease and contribute to higher morbidity and mortality for minority populations. Global warming and climate change will have severe impacts on the incidence of disease and the equitable distribution of healthcare. If these past 14 months have demonstrated anything, however, it is that the bioinformatics community is ready and willing to face these challenges head on.",
