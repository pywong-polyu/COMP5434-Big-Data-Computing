ADRs are reported to account for 6.5% of all admissions to hospital and estimated to cost the UK NHS \u00a3466 M annually [1] . As a result, the prevalence of trial and error prescribing should be reduced and patient outcomes enhanced [2] . In line with other diagnostic testing the cost of this new technology is rapidly reducing [3] . To date, PGx testing services in community pharmacy have been implemented and evaluated in the USA [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , Canada [10] [11] [12] and the Netherlands [13] . Given the precedents set elsewhere and developments in the arena of genomics over the last decade, there is an opportunity to design and implement a PGx testing service for patients in a community pharmacy setting in the UK. Such a service would require dovetailing with the nature of UK health systems and the working practices of healthcare professionals, as well as meeting the expectations of patients as service users.",

Furthermore, community pharmacists are the last healthcare professional to see a patient before they start a new medicine and are therefore ideally located to provide a PGx testing service. By 2025, the new NHS genomics medicine service will be integrated into routine care [19] . Pharmacists could be an integral part of this service, from administering the test, explaining test results to patients, to alerting prescribers to significant gene-drug interactions. However, the exact interface with community pharmacists is so far unclear, but with ease of access and their extended role, community pharmacy has the potential to be the most conveniently located solution for pharmacogenomic testing.",

A recent study reviewing prescription data in the Netherlands estimated that 24% of all newly prescribed medicines for a range of 45 common drugs dispensed in a community pharmacy setting had a potential drug-gene interaction (DGI) [20] . In an evaluation of a PGx service, also in the Netherlands, 17.8% patients were advised to change their drug and 14.0% to amend the dose of their current medication; it was noted that \"pre-emptive analysis of genotyped patients showed that the majority (99.2%) had actionable variants\" [21] . Similarly, in a recent UK study, it was estimated that between 19.1% and 21.1% of all newly prescribed medicines for 56 drugs involved an actionable DGI, which would have resulted in a recommended change of drug or dose for 8.6%-9.1% patients [22] . Finally, in an implementation study with patient participants (n = 100) in two community pharmacies in Toronto, Canada, a descriptive study reported on a range of interventions that required prescriber referral following receipt of a PGx test result. The pharmacist recommended a change of drug for 60% patients (n = 41), a dosage change for 13% (n = 9), increasing monitoring for 22% (n = 15) and stopping the medicine altogether for 4% (n = 3).",

Prescribing medicines that work better results in better patient engagement with resultant improved care for the patient as \"supporting patients to be actively involved in their own care, treatment and support can improve outcomes and experience for patients, and potentially yield efficiency savings for the system\" [31] . PGx facilitates increased engagement moving patients from simply having a list of drugs on a prescription to having a conversation that enables a deeper understanding of which medicines work best for them in relation to their genetic constitution.",

This was noted in a study in Pennsylvania and Ohio, USA where it was reported that \"most community pharmacists held positive views about the clinical utility of PGx\" [32] . It was also reported that pharmacists were willing to integrate this into their professional practice, having an overall positive attitude to a PGx service [33] . However, the lack of education of pharmacists in PGx has been identified as a barrier to implementation of a testing service in a community pharmacy setting. In a study conducted in Pittsburgh, USA, pharmacists (n = 11) \"recognised the limitations of their formal education\" however \"recognized their needs for enriched knowledge and instruction\" and noted the required training to be similar to that for the introduction of certified training vaccination programmes [9] . Similarly, in another study in Kentucky, USA, 38% of pharmacist participants (n = 101) stated that they had no current knowledge of personalized medicine, however 81% agreed that they would be willing to complete this education programme in the future [34] .",

The GPs were recruited by the researcher sending an email to 23 GPs, working in practices co-located to a Day Lewis pharmacy, requesting expression of interest from themselves or a colleague.

To guarantee the integrity of the medicines supply chain, any medicine that has left the pharmacy premises may not later be dispensed for other patients as the efficacy, quality and safety cannot be assured, and therefore must be destroyed [39] .",

The benefits of linking the NMS and PGx testing to improve patients' healthcare were noted and, pharmacists were starting to envisage how the PGx service could be linked to and integrated with existing community pharmacy services. Lack of resources to deliver the service was a clear concern identified by pharmacists and to a lesser extent by GPs, as a barrier to implementation. Three specific concerns were noted: the lack of time for healthcare professionals, lack of space and a quality clinical environment in the community pharmacy to undertake the consultation with the patient and a lack of NHS drugs budget should the PGx analysis recommend a more expensive drug.",

This is not a clear green light to go ahead however, the in-principle buy in was at a high level and largely decoupled from considerations of service delivery processes. Furthermore, receptiveness was not unconditional; in particular patients defaulting to data and privacy concerns. Any design of a PGx service needs to robustly address these concerns to remove any barriers to implementation as any issue, however small, could make the difference between a patient agreeing to participate in the service or not. This receptiveness was also reported in previous research [4, 5] with patients showing an interest in the service, high levels of participation and an overall comprehension of their test results. Pharmacist's willingness and confidence to deliver the service was also reported [33] although interestingly GPs could also see PGx testing as part of their role. This could be a legacy view though as more testing and vaccination services are now undertaken by community pharmacists as part of their extended clinical role.",

It is important that careful attention is paid to each of these areas and that solutions, whether complete or partial, are co-designed in partnership with those delivering the service. Previous research has indicated that time may not be a significant barrier suggesting that minimal time is required to deliver the service [5] and that it is comparable to a vaccination service which pharmacists regularly deliver as part of their role [11] . Similarly, space requirements for delivering a PGx testing service has been considered as the \"least significant barriers\" to implementation of a PGx service in a community pharmacy setting [34] , although no evidence about the quality of the clinical environment for PGx testing was mentioned. Most community pharmacies in the UK have invested in an appropriate consultation room in recent years that may be suitable for conducting this service [42] . The perceptions of the pharmacist participants differ however, and it will be important to take this into account and understand what their perception of the shortfall in space provision is due to. Finally, limited drug budget resource within the UK health system is a perennial challenge, however this concern may be mitigated if there is an overall cost saving to the NHS, as anticipated. Certainly, all these concerns need to be fully The theme ambiguity about implications for implementation was also identified as a barrier to implementation. All three participant groups were both uncertain about many aspects whilst helpfully suggesting ideas. They acknowledged a current lack of knowledge, information and guidance that would be required prior to implementation in a UK community pharmacy setting. Despite this ambiguity, ideas were forthcoming from system level, through to pace of implementation, identification of patients, storage and format of test results and the optimum stage in the patient pathway to intervene. Encouragingly, there was some consensus between the three participant groups, despite them all having a different professional or lay perspective on the service design. Pharmacist and GPs self-confessed lack of genomic knowledge was a clear concern. Pharmacists need to have access to PGx knowledge training and gain expertise in interpreting the test results so that they can make appropriate clinical decisions. The literature also reported this as a concern with a recent scoping review reporting that \"there is clearly a need to educate the profession and a need to consider if the training is included in the undergraduate programme or whether it is provided when pharmacists commence providing the service\" [30] . Consideration will also be required to support GPs with a basic level of PGx training. One particular concern raised by both GP and patient participants was \"what else will the testing reveal and what impact will this have on my insurance?\". It needs to be clearly stated that the testing will only report on specific drug-gene interactions. In addition, the UK Government and the Association of British Insurers (ABI) have agreed a voluntary code of practice on the role of genetic testing in insurance [43] . Some of this lack of guidance was also noted in the literature with a paucity of relevant patient information in a user-friendly format reported [4] .",

The literature notes pharmacists reporting high levels of prescriber acceptance of recommendations for an amendment to the prescription [4] , the exception being where the prescriber did not have knowledge about PGx testing [10] . With all healthcare roles evolving, and with pharmacists delivering more healthcare services e.g. medicine reviews, hypertension case finding, vaccination services and health checks [44] , there was some evidence of potential conflict both in the literature [45] and in the GP and pharmacist participant groups. The advent of pharmacist independent prescribers, with all newly qualified pharmacists gaining this qualification, will also allow pharmacists to make changes to medication in collaboration with GPs, but without having to seek direct approval. There is clearly a potential for Pharmacist and GP interprofessional relationships to be a barrier, and this must be carefully considered as part of the service design.",

Evidence of a foundational level of receptiveness was noted by patient, pharmacist and prescriber groups, and both professional groups appreciated potential benefits for their patients and the healthcare system. The ambiguity surrounding the service for all three groups needs further clarification at a granular level as part of the service design. Finally building collaborative relationships with prescribers and pharmacists is a challenge that requires careful consideration to ensure the benefits of this novel service to be realised. ",
