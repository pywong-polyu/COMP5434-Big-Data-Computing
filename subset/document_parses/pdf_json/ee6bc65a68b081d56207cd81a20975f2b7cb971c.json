The protocol is frequently followed after an individual presents with disease symptoms, at which point they will be tested for the pathogen. This TTIQ strategy, along with hygiene and social distancing measures, make up the non-pharmaceutical interventions that are utilised to suppress the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Here we develop a tractable mathematical model of disease transmission and the TTIQ intervention to quantify how the probability of detecting and isolating a case following symptom onset, the fraction of contacts that are identified and quarantined, and the delays inherent to these processes impact epidemic growth. In the model, the timing of disease transmission and symptom onset, as well as the frequency of asymptomatic cases, is based on empirical distributions of SARS-CoV-2 infection dynamics, while the isolation of confirmed cases and quarantine of their contacts is implemented by truncating their respective infectious periods. We find that a successful TTIQ strategy requires intensive testing: the majority of transmission is prevented by isolating symptomatic individuals and doing so in a short amount of time. Despite the lesser impact, additional contact tracing and quarantine increases the parameter space in which an epidemic is controllable and is necessary to control epidemics with a high reproductive number. TTIQ could remain an important intervention for the foreseeable future of the COVID-19 pandemic due to slow vaccine rollout and highly-transmissible variants with the potential for vaccine escape. Our results can be used to assess how TTIQ can be improved and optimised, and the methodology represents an improvement over previous quantification methods that is applicable to future epidemic scenarios.",

Individuals who have been in recent close contact with an infected individual have an increased risk of being infected themselves. By identifying the potentially-infected contacts through contact tracing and eventually quarantining them, transmission chains can be broken. Thus contact tracing is an essential public health tool for controlling epidemics [1] . The strategy of testing to identify infected cases, isolating them to prevent further transmission, and tracing & quarantining their recent close contacts is known as test-trace-isolate-quarantine (TTIQ) [2] . This strategy is a key non-pharmaceutical intervention which is used globally to control the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic [3] . Testing typically occurs once an individual develops symptoms indicative of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID- 19) . As presymptomatic transmission makes up approximately 40% of total onward transmission from eventually-symptomatic infecteds [4] [5] [6] , it would be possible for the number of secondary infections to be more than halved if infected individuals were isolated from the community at the time of symptom onset. However, as testing follows from symptoms in this scenario, the testing & isolating strategy without subsequent contact tracing & quarantine is unlikely to capture persistently-asymptomatic infections which make up around 20% of all infecteds [7] , and thus isolating 100% of infecteds at symptom onset would not be possible.",

This is exemplified during super-spreader events [9] [10] [11] where large numbers of potentially-infected contacts can be quarantined to prevent widespread community transmission.

Kretzschmar et al. [13] also predominantly focussed on digital contact tracing based on mobile applications, confirming the conclusions of Ferretti et al. [12] that minimising delays is the key to a successful TTIQ intervention. Through simulations based on real-world contact networks, Kucharski et al. [3] concluded that > 75% of contacts have to be quarantined (through manual contact tracing or digital app-based tracing) to reduce the effective reproduction number below one. Finally, Grantz et al.

These distributions are: the generation time distribution (describing the time interval between the infection of an index case and secondary case); the infectivity profile (describing the time interval between the onset of symptoms in the index case and infection of the secondary case); and the incubation period distribution (describing the time between the infection of an individual and the onset of their symptoms). These distributions (shown in Fig I in S1 Appendix) are based on large sets of transmission pairs and minimal assumptions about the relationship between infectiousness and symptoms, which would otherwise push the variance of the resulting generation time distribution towards its upper or lower extremes [20] . The fraction of transmission that occurs before symptom onset in symptomatically-infected individuals is defined by the cumulative infectivity profile (or generation time) up to the time of symptom onset. The infectivity profile and incubation periods are undefined (and unnecessary) for asymptomatic cases, and in the model we make the simplifying assumption that the generation time distribution is the same between asymptomatic and symptomatic cases.",

As we are interested in quantifying the effects of TTIQ strategies, we introduce the parameter R which represents the effective reproductive number of the virus in the presence of interventions such as mask-wearing, social distancing, school closures etc., but in the absence of isolation and quarantine. We refer to this R parameter as \"the baseline R-value in the absence of TTIQ\", and we have R \ufffd R 0 due to the presence of the non-TTIQ preventative measures. Furthermore, the baseline reproductive number R should be greater than or equal to the currently observed effective reproductive number, which includes the impact of in-place TTIQ measures. In the absence of TTIQ interventions, we would expect R infections in the second generation, and R 2 infections in the third generation. This R-value will depend on the strain of SARS-CoV-2 that is considered, for example new variants of concern such as Alpha (B.1.1.7) and Delta (B.1.617.2) are significantly more transmissible than pre-existing variants [21] [22] [23] .

Testing & isolating acts to reduce the number of secondary infections per index case by shortening the duration in which the index case can infect susceptible individuals, i.e. isolation truncates the distribution of infection times ( Fig 1A) . We assume that isolation happens after a fixed delay of \u0394 1 days after symptom onset, and that only a fraction f of symptomatic individuals are isolated. This incomplete coverage can be attributed to symptom misdiagnosis, a failure or unwillingness to get tested if symptomatic, a false-negative test result, or non-adherence to the isolation protocol. The fraction isolated f can also be reduced by false-negative results based on potentially less-sensitive self-administered tests, which could prevent infected individuals from seeking confirmatory point-of-care tests. For those individuals who are isolated, we assume that they cannot infect further for the remaining duration of their infectious period. This assumption of perfect adherence to isolation once tested positive will lead to an overestimation of TTIQ effectiveness. Any lack of adherence to isolation could be accounted for in the model by reducing f, as long as this lack of adherence also means that their contacts are not traced. In the model, asymptomatic individuals are not subject to symptomatic testing and isolation. These asymptomatic individuals could be tested during surveillance (mass-testing or surge testing), and isolation would follow as above if a positive test result is obtained.

The contact tracers focus on a specific time window of infection to identify the contacts with highest risk of being infected. In our model this window extends to \u03c4 days before symptom onset in the index case. It is unlikely that every contact within this time window is memorable or traceable, so we assume that only a fraction g of the secondary contacts within this window are eventually quarantined. Quarantine begins after a fixed delay of \u0394 2 days after the isolation of the index case, representing the time required for the contact to be identified by contact tracers and to enter quarantine. For those who are quarantined, we assume that they cannot infect further for the remaining duration of their infectious period. This assumption of perfect adherence to quarantined once identified through contact tracing will lead to an overestimation of TTIQ effectiveness. However, any lack of adherence to isolation is easily accounted for in the model by reducing g. Importantly, quarantine occurs independently of whether these secondary infections are asymptomatic or will eventually develop symptoms. Furthermore, contact tracing can also achieved through digital app-based technology [12] . The proposed model applies to both manual and digital contact tracing, but we note that we would expect different parameter combinations for digital versus manual contact tracing, for example reduced delays \u0394 2 for digital contact tracing [12, 13] .

Below this line (blue zone) we have less than one secondary infection per infected and the epidemic is suppressed. Dashed lines are the 95% confidence interval for this threshold, representing the uncertainty in the inferred generation time distribution and infectivity profile. B: Lines correspond to slices of panel A at a fixed delay to isolation \u0394 1 = 0, 2, or 4 days after symptom onset (colour). Shaded regions are 95% confidence intervals for the reproductive number, representing the uncertainty in the inferred generation time distribution and infectivity profile. Horizontal grey line is the threshold for epidemic control (R TI = 1).

Under idealised conditions, testing & isolation plus contact tracing & quarantine can prevent substantially more transmission than testing & isolation only. However, the effects of delays and inaccuracies in the TTIQ processes are compounded for contact tracing & quarantine, which ultimately relies on index case identification to be effective. Ignoring this compounding effect would potentially overestimate the impact that contact tracing can have on transmission reduction. Based on our systematic analysis, we find that the greatest improvement to the TTIQ process would come from increased identification and isolation of symptomatic index cases and reduction of delay between symptom onset and isolation. These parameters contribute to the direct reduction of onward infection from an index case, and optimising them allows more contacts to be traced earlier. These results align with those of Grantz et al. [17] . From a public health perspective, increasing the identification and speeding up the isolation of symptomatic index cases could be achieved through widely-available rapid testing. Despite the potentially lower sensitivity of rapid tests compared to RT-PCR tests, their effectiveness at reducing transmission has been demonstrated in simulation studies of index case isolation [25] .",

The reproductive number is calculated for each TTIQ parameter combination, and the output (R TTIQ ) is categorised into bins of width 0.1 (colour). We then use LDA to construct a linear combination (LD1) of the five (normalised) TTIQ parameters which maximally separates the output categories. We then predict the LD1 values for each parameter combination, and construct a histogram of these values for each category. The lower panel shows the components of the primary linear discriminant vector (LD1). By multiplying the (normalised) TTIQ parameters by the corresponding vector component, we arrive at the LD1 prediction which corresponds to the predicted reproductive number under that TTIQ strategy. Longer arrows (larger magnitude components) correspond to a parameter having a larger effect on the reproductive number. The distributions of parameters per categorised reproductive number is shown in S2 Fig. Data [26] approach to model contact tracing and isolation as independent events (i.e. tracing an index cases' contacts says nothing about whether the index case has been isolated). Although this assumption leads to analytically tractable predictions of the reproductive number under TTIQ, it also leads to an overestimation of contact tracing's impact [26] . Our approach can therefore be considered as a methodological advance over Fraser et al. [26] and should be employed in the analysis of future epidemic scenarios.",

Based on our systematic LDA analysis with quadratic parameters (S4 Fig), we know that there is considerable interaction between testing coverage f and isolation delay \u0394 1 . Therefore, we expect that sensitivity to testing coverage would appear at shorter delay values, and on average across these parameters we show that increasing f has a greater effect on the reproductive number than decreasing \u0394 1 .",

These transmission pairs are representative of symptomatic cases, but the infectiousness profiles for persistently-asymptomatic infections are as-yet unknown [6] . We have assumed that asymptomatically-infected individuals have the same infection timing distributions as symptomatic individuals, but any differences between the shapes of these profiles will lead to different results in terms of transmission reduction. Uncertainty in the inferred infection timing distributions is carried through our analysis and is captured by the confidence intervals shown in the figures and reported in the text. Furthermore, we do account for potential differences in the overall transmissibility between asymptomatic and symptomatic individuals. It is possible that the 20% of infections that are asymptomatic are responsible for less than 20% of transmission in the absence of any TTIQ interventions. We show in S2 Appendix that TTIQ becomes more effective as asymptomatic transmission decreases. Therefore, our results could be underestimating TTIQ efficacy, to a small extent.",

If the increased transmission of the new variants is due to a longer-lasting infectious period, then we expect TTIQ to be more efficient, as the additional transmission events would be prevented by isolation and quarantine.

In itself, this does not impact the result of our analysis: the impact of isolation remains higher than that of quarantine across different values of R (Fig 3) . However, in contexts where a large proportion of symptomatic individuals already isolate, the scope for increasing isolation may be limited. Under such circumstances, mass or random testing, if successfully followed by isolation, may be a promising intervention. This is supported by data on the effectiveness of mass testing interventions, for example in Slovakia [28] . In this scenario it would be possible to identify asymptomatic index cases, as well as identifying eventually-symptomatic cases before symptom onset. Through this increased index case identification and isolation, as well as the reduced time that these index cases are infectious and non-isolated, and also reducing the number of secondary contacts that have to be identified by contact tracing, mass/random testing would therefore increase the overall performance of TTIQ.",

However, the branching process approach is valid over short time scales (like the two generations of transmission that we calculate), provided that the susceptible population size is much larger than R 2 .

Crucially, contact tracing & quarantine adds security to testing & isolating strategies, where high coverage and short delays are necessary to control an epidemic. By improving the testing & isolation coverage and reducing the delay to index case isolation, we can greatly increase the efficacy of the overall TTIQ strategy. The fraction of prevented transmission that can be attributed to quarantine, rather than isolation. Let R TTIQ (g) be the reproductive number in the presence of TTIQ interventions in which a fraction g of contacts of identified index cases are quarantined. In the absence of TTIQ measures, we expect a reproductive number of R. We then define Y(g) = R \u2212 R TTIQ (g) as reduction of transmission due to TTIQ, and Y(0) = R \u2212 R TTIQ (0) as the reduction of transmission due only to isolation (i.e. no contact tracing & quarantine). We then define the fraction of prevented transmission due to quarantine as [Y(g) \u2212 Y (0)]/Y(g), which we plot as a function of g. Note that we are computing how much extra transmission is prevented by quarantine, which may just be one days worth of transmission before the contact becomes symptomatic and would anyway be isolated. We vary the fraction of symptomatic index cases that are isolated f (colour), and we fix \u0394 1 = \u0394 2 = \u03c4 = 2 days. We further fix the fraction of transmission that is attributed to asymptomatic infections to \u03b1 = 20% and R = 1.5 (although the fraction shown is independent of R). Above the horizontal line, more transmission is prevented by quarantine than by isolation. Data provided in S1 Dataset.

We use the same uniformly-sampled data as in Fig 5 in the manuscript, but now we include the quadratic parameter terms (e.g. f \u00d7 g) as discriminators too. We take the square root of these quadratic terms to ensure the parameter distributions are not overly skewed. We then use LDA to construct a linear combination (LD1) of the now 15 TTIQ parameters which maximally separates the output categories. We then predict the LD1 values for each parameter combination, and construct a histogram of these values for each category. The lower panel shows the components of the primary linear discriminant vector (LD1). By multiplying the (normalised) TTIQ parameters by the corresponding vector component, we arrive at the LD1 prediction which corresponds to the predicted reproductive number under that TTIQ strategy. Longer arrows (larger magnitude components) correspond to a parameter having a larger effect on the reproductive number. Data provided in S1 Dataset. (PDF) ",

A: Under testing & isolation, index cases are identified and isolated from the population after a delay \u0394 1 after they develop symptoms (at time t S 1 ). This curtails their duration of infectiousness and reduces the number of secondary infections. This isolation occurs in a fraction f of symptomatic individuals. B: Under additional contact tracing & quarantine, the contacts of an index case can be identified and quarantined after an additional delay \u0394 2 . This reduces the onward transmission from these secondary contacts. Only contacts that occur during the contact tracing window can be identified. This window extends from \u03c4 days before the index case developed symptoms (i.e. t S 1 \u00c0 t) to the time at which the index case was isolated (i.e. t S 1 \u00fe D 1 ). A fraction g of the contacts who were infected within the contact tracing window are quarantined. The remaining individuals are not quarantined, but could be isolated if they are later detected as an index case. The distributions shown here are schematic representations of the infectivity profile and/or generation time interval, which are quantitatively displayed inFig I in S1Appendix. These distributions reflect an individual's infectiousness as a function of time.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0263597.g001",

We set the baseline R = 1.5 throughout, which is the intensity of the epidemic in the absence of any TTIQ intervention.

R TTIQ for the focal parameter sets are shown as thin black lines. With f = 0 (no TTIQ) we expect R TTIQ = R (upper grey line). We then vary each TTIQ parameter individually, keeping the remaining four parameters fixed at the focal values. The upper panel shows the probability parameters f and g, while the lower panel shows the parameters which carry units of time (days). The critical threshold for controlling an epidemic is R TTIQ = 1 (lower grey line). We fix the fraction of transmission that is attributed to asymptomatic infections to \u03b1 = 20%.
