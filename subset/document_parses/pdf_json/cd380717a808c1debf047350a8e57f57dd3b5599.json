Accordingly, many individuals may have canceled their annual health-check programs, including esophagogastroduodenoscopy, which would have resulted in lower numbers of newly diagnosed patients with gastric cancer in comparison to other times. Methods Questionnaires were distributed to 62 hospitals every week from May 2020 to August 2020 (total 744) through mailing lists of the Stomach Cancer Study Group of the Japan Clinical Oncology Group. The number of patients with gastric cancer and hospital systems during the COVID-19 pandemic were surveyed. Results In total, 74% (551 out of 744) of the questionnaires were answered and analyzed. In early May, approximately 50% of hospitals had to restrict surgical slots due to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they gradually loosened the restrictions thereafter. The number of gastrectomies was < 80% that of the same period in the previous year, and hospitals in Tokyo were seriously affected by a 50% decrease in the number of gastrectomies. Conclusions The number of gastrectomies was lower than that in the previous year. Further multi-center follow-up studies are required to evaluate the long-term effects of COVID-19 on the clinical outcomes of patients with gastric cancer.",

Since then, the spread of COVID-19 has affected the socioeconomic and healthcare systems of many countries, including Japan (Supplementary Fig. 1 ) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Elderly people are reportedly more susceptible to COVID-19 with higher mortality rates. Therefore, \"stay-at-home orders\" urging people to stay home as much as possible has heavily affected the lifestyle of this population [10] . Although less susceptible, younger people were also asked to stay home to avoid infection and to stop the spread of COVID-19. Since it is considered that visiting a hospital increases the risk of COVID-19 transmission, many people have refrained from going to hospitals unless they are seriously ill. Accordingly, many people might have canceled their annual health-check programs, including EGD, which would result in smaller numbers of new gastric cancer diagnoses in comparison to usual years [11] .",

Overall, among 744 questionnaires, 551 (74%) replies were answered and analyzed (Supplementary Fig. 4) . To obtain as many answers as possible to Q1, which was essential to estimate the actual decrease in the number of gastrectomies during the COVID-19 pandemic and which was considered one of the most important items in the questionnaire, a reminder was sent to the researchers in the second week of September, and they were asked to fill in the number of gastrectomies per each week during the study period. At the same time, they were also asked about the number of gastrectomy procedures in the previous year. In 2019, 6089 gastrectomies were performed in 49 institutions. Figure 2 illustrates the effect of COVID-19 on the number of patients newly diagnosed with gastric cancer (Q2), the hospital system (Q3, Q5), and clinical trials (Q13). In the first week of this study, in approximately 50% of institutions, there was a decrease in the number of new patients, and the proportion gradually increased, reaching 80% during the last week of the study. Additionally, the proportion of institutions that experienced a drastic decrease in the number of new patients sharply increased in the early half of the study period, reaching approximately 50%. Approximately half of the institutions hospitalized COVID-19 patients at the beginning of the study (the 1st week of May), gradually decreasing to 20% by the midway point (the 3rd and 4th week of June). Finally, it increased again to 60% at the end of the study period (4th week of August). A similar trend could be seen in the answers to Q5. Figure 3 shows the effect of COVID-19 on surgical slots. In the early study period (the 1st to 4th week of May), surgeries for malignant disease, including gastrectomy for gastric cancer, were restricted to approximately 40% of institutions, while those for benign disease, such as cholecystectomy and inguinal hernia repair, were restricted to approximately 60% of institutions. The degree of restriction was more severe for benign disease. Additionally, 20% of institutions had to restrict surgical slots by Fig. 1 The contents of the questionnaire survey more than 67% in comparison to normal times, while the degree of restriction for malignant disease was < 33% in comparison to normal times in most hospitals. The restrictions gradually weakened, and fewer than 20% of hospitals had mild restrictions (1-33% of restriction) by the end of the study period. Emergency surgeries were less affected by COVID-19 than were elective surgeries. Figure 4 depicts the effect of COVID-19 on chemotherapy and endoscopy, in which a similar trend to that in surgery was seen.

Therefore, surgeons, medical oncologists, and endoscopists who usually take care of gastric cancer patients are involved in treating patients with COVID-19 [6] . In Japan, the government declared a state of emergency in early April 2020, and thereafter, the number of patients with COVID-19 was gradually decreased [12] . However, the number of patients began to increase again in the middle of July, and the proportion of hospitals in which surgeons, medical oncologists, or endoscopists were involved in the treatment of COVID-19 also started to increase. Surgery, chemotherapy, and endoscopy slots were restricted, to some extent, at the beginning of the pandemic, although these restrictions were gradually reduced. Initially, many hospitals seemingly prepared for the management of COVID-19 by restricting treatment for other patients, and thus had to limit surgical slots. On the other hand, hospitals did not need to restrict the number of slots in the latter period. However, even in the latter study period when the restriction of surgical slots was attenuated-in many hospitals, the number of gastric cancer patients was lower in comparison to the previous year (Q2 in Fig. 2) . To estimate the decrease in gastrectomies, the ratio of the actual number of gastrectomies per week to that in the previous year was calculated. The number of gastrectomies was drastically decreased in the Kanto and Kansai areas, where the incidence of COVID-19 was higher in comparison to other regions. Notably, the number of gastrectomies in Tokyo, where COVID-19 patient numbers were the highest in Japan, decreased by 50% in comparison to the previous year. However, we have to note that this decrease might have been somewhat affected by the natural decrease in the number of patients with gastric cancer. Nevertheless, the drop by 50% in Tokyo cannot be explained without the effect of COVID-19. The answer to this question will be obtained after the pandemic ends.",

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, people in this age group, particularly those over 70 years of age, who were considered to be susceptible to COVID-19 infection, might have refrained from going to hospitals to receive medical check-ups, including EGD.
