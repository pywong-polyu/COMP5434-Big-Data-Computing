If your patient were already admitted to the hospital for greater than 48 h (HAP) or had been on a ventilator for greater than 48 h (VAP), what pathogens would you have to worry about? List the pathogens under HAP and VAP as shown in Fig. 30.1. Stenotrophomonas \u2022 Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP): same as HAP; consider Aspergillus if immunocompromised \u2022 Note that for HAP and VAP, you must consider multi-drug resistant (MDR)organisms such as MRSA and GNR like Pseudomonas or E coli that have multidrug resistance patterns, as clinical concern for these should inform empiric antibiotic selection.E. Your patient has no other medical problems, has not been recently hospitalized, nor has been treated with antibiotics in the past 6 months.
