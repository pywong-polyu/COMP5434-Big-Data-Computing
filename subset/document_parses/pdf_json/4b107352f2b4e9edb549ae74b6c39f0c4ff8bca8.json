In doing so, we gain insight into the contribution of people-people and people-pathogen interactions to the spread of transmissible diseases. A general modelling framework is used to assess the risk of infection in indoor environments due to people-pathogen interactions via inhalation of viral airborne aerosols, and contact with contaminated surfaces. We couple the indoor environment model with a standard disease transmission model to investigate how both people-people and people-pathogen interactions result in disease transmission. The coupled model is referred to as the SEIR-e model. To demonstrate the applicability of the SEIR-e model and the novel insights it can provide into different exposure pathways, parameter values which describe exposure due to people-people and people-pathogen interactions are inferred using Bayesian techniques and case data relating to the 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 in Victoria (Australia).",

The BLO model and its application to SARS-CoV-2 is outlined in [31] . The contaminant is assumed to be instantaneously well-mixed with ambient air, and the indoor environment is assumed to be well-ventilated such that clean ambient air exchanges with airborne contaminant at rate n air . These assumptions give rise to the air exchange term in Eq (1) . The decay terms in Eqs (1)-(2) account for the degradation and deactivation of airborne and surface contaminant, where the time dependent airborne and surface decay rates, \u03bb air (t) and \u03bb sfc (t) respectively, vary with temperature (T ) and relative humidity (RH) [32, 33] (Fig   2(b) ). Deposition of airborne aerosols onto horizontal surfaces via gravitational settling and diffusion is approximated by the deposition term in Eqs (1)- (2) , where the rate of deposition depends on the height of the room, h. The deposition velocity, v i,dep , increases with droplet size, and large droplets above a threshold are assumed to deposit instantaneously in order to conserve mass.",

In Eqs (1)- (2) , the inhalation and pickup terms are included using summations such that C i,t and D i,t represent the total concentration of airborne and deposited material in the environment. Assuming all susceptible individuals receive the same dose, corresponding summations are not required in Eq (3) as F i,t is the dose received by a single susceptible individual. The inhalation term represents that breathing occurs at a rate R air where a fraction of the environment is inhaled with each breath, V air /V . We assume that only droplets within the respirable range are inhaled by choosing \u03c3 = 1 if i \u2264 j and 0 otherwise, where j denotes the number of size bins within the respirable range. As larger droplets deposit quicker than smaller droplets, we choose j to reflect the distance from the source at which droplets are assumed to be respirable. For example, small values of j correspond to the assumption that only small droplets can be inhaled. That is, exposed individuals are located some distance away from the source. Conversely, large values of j relate to a larger respirable range such that exposed individuals are assumed to be located near the source. The pickup term corresponds to a fraction of surface material, A sfc /A, being removed via the hands at a rate R sfc with efficiency q. We assume that contaminant is transferred from the hands to the mouth or nose at efficiency r.",

The SEIR-e model explicitly distinguishes between exposure due to people-people and people-pathogen interactions, while the standard SEIR model implicitly includes transmission due to different exposure pathways. Thus, it is reasonable that estimates of \u03b2 are greater than \u03b2 0 , and comparing these estimates provides insight into the proportion of \u03b2 which can be attributed to different exposure pathways. The similarities between the posteriors for \u03b2 air,sfc could imply that the contribution of inhalation and surface pickup on exposure are analogous, as implied in the phase plane analysis of the environment model (refer to Application to SARS-CoV-2).",

A physics-based environment model is developed to investigate how exposure to pathogens via inhalation and surface pickup results in infection. While the environment model is parametrised for SARS-CoV-2, the general modelling framework is applicable to other chemical, biological or radiological materials. Derivation of analytic solutions and linear stability analysis indicates that while viral deposition is the dominant decay process, the contribution of airborne and deposited material to the total dose received is equivalent in the long time limit. By coupling the environment model with a standard compartment model for disease transmission, we formulate the SEIR-e model to investigate the spread of infectious diseases due to people-people and peoplepathogen interactions.",

This results in a expression for R 0 (t) which accounts of people-people interactions, inhalation of viral aerosols, and fomite transmission. Another novelty is the coupling between indoor air quality and disease transmission, which captures the contribution of physical processes such as air exchange, viral decay and deposition on disease transmission. One advantage of using the SEIR-e model to study infectious diseases is that we gain insight into what proportion of the traditional contact parameter, \u03b2, accounts for people-people and people-pathogen interactions. A case study of the 2020 Victorian outbreak of COVID-19 demonstrates this where parameter values which describe people-people interactions differ significantly from \u03b2. Similar insight could be gained for other influenza like illnesses, and could be used to assess the impact of infection prevention and controls measures on reducing transmission.",

Another assumption is that the environment is well-ventilated such that the airborne contaminant exchanges with ambient air at a rate n air . To investigate the effect of these assumptions, we vary n air and j simultaneously. The settling time for droplets with diameter 250 \u00b5m is approximately 6 seconds. We assume that 6 seconds is sufficient for droplets to be inhaled at least 1.5 m from the source, and choose j values ranging from 30-250 bins, and n air values ranging from 1-5 changes hr \u22121 .",

However, as each parameter is bound by appropriate values found in the literature, we vary parameters within reasonable limits to determine which parameters have a greater influence on the probability of infection. Methods for measuring the surface area of the hand vary between studies, resulting in highly diverse values for A sfc which depend on biological factors such as age, gender and race [50] [51] [52] . As SARS-CoV-2 was mainly transmitted between adults at the time of the Victorian outbreak, we compare A sfc values for adults of different races. A study which considers mainly Caucasian adults reported that A sfc = 0.0128 m 2 [52] , whereas a study which considers Asian adults found that A sfc = 0.0139 m 2 [51] . One study that considers a mix of races reported that A sfc = 0.027 m 2 [50] . Thus, we compare A sfc values ranging from 0.0128-0.027 m 2 , and we choose R sfc values ranging from 1-13",

A number of viral parameters govern e i , including the coughing rate, R c , the breathing rate, \u03ba air , and the viral load, N VL . Values for R c vary between individuals and infections, with no average value available for SARS-CoV-2, and values for \u03ba air vary depending on body weight, age and activity levels. One study reports that the maximum resting breathing rate for an adult (older than 12 years of age) is 0.137 L/minute per kilogram of body weight, whereas the maximum moderate breathing rate is 0.384 L/minute per kilogram of body weight [54] . For high intensity activities, such as running, the maximum breathing rate is 0.962 L/minute per kilogram of body weight [54] . As we are considering environments such as workplaces and residential buildings, we choose breathing rate values ranging from 0.137-0.384 L/minute per kilogram of body weight, and assume an average adult weighs 80 kg.
