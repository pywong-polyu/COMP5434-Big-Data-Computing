Obesity and overweight were associated with a higher risk of impaired physical function due to reduction in muscle mass, an increased risk of falling, and an increased likelihood of numerous non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and dementia [4] . With these multiple morbidities, overweight and obese elderly people are at risk of becoming dependent on others for their activities of daily living and of experiencing an impaired quality of life [5] .",

Statistically speaking, most elderly people who are obese or overweight have multiple comorbidities and are not as physically active as non-obese or overweight elderly people. Thus, health programs should not focus on managing individual diseases alone; rather, they should take a holistic approach to manage the health of elderly people. The recommended program for the health improvement of elderly people is the PA program. There are various PA programs for the elderly, including brisk walking, dancing, swimming, bicycle riding, and others [7] . Walking is the preferred PA program among the elderly, as it does not require any special equipment, facilities, or skills [8] .",

The pedometer measured participants' step count over the course of each day and provided feedback on the amount of PA they undertook. Every Friday, there was a gathering at the elderly health club to examine each person's step counts achieved over the previous week.

Continuous data were presented in terms of mean\u00b1SD for normally distributed data and medians and interquartile ranges for data with an abnormal distribution. The categorical data were presented in terms of frequencies and percentages. For inferential analysis, repeated-measures ANOVA was used to examine the changes in dependent variables in each group (BMI, body fat percentage, skeletal muscle percentage, visceral fat percentage, and waist circumference). A p-value less than 0.05 was considered to indicate statistical significance. The assumption of a normal distribution of the dependent variables in each group was checked. The Levene test of equality of error variances was met and Box's M test showed a p-value>0.001; thus, the assumption of ho-mogeneity of variances was met. However, the Mauchly test was significant, showing that the assumption of sphericity was violated. Since repeated-measures ANOVA is robust to some violations, the interpretation of test results was continued by using either the Greenhouse-Geisser (BMI, waist circumference, and body fat percentage) or Huynh-Feldt correction test (skeletal muscle percentage, daily steps) [19] .",

Fauzi et al. [26] reported similar results in a study conducted among adults (20-50 years old) over 10 weeks, which showed there was no significant reduction from pre-intervention to post-intervention, with a BMI change of -0.4 kg/m 2 . The effect of a pedometer-based intervention alone on weight loss was greater on older adults rather than young adults. This can be explained by the fact that younger adults are much more responsive to programs combined with dietary intervention and not just walking interventions alone [26] [27] [28] . A second explanation could be natural weight loss or unintentional weight loss in older adults. This can be caused by various malignant and nonmalignant factors such as chronic diseases, side effects of medications (especially metformin), social factors, and underlying malignancies [29, 30] . This study also showed that 83% of participants had at least 1 NCD, such as hypertension, diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia, and were actively treated with medications at nearby health clinics. A third explanation pertains to the metabolic cost of walking (MCoW). MCoW refers to the amount of energy consumed by the human body in order to move. The MCoW was found to be positively correlated with age and BMI [31] .",

This study reported a decrease in fat percentage of 3.52% (equivalent to 3.01 kg), a decrease in visceral fat percentage of 1.29% (equivalent to 0.95 kg), and a decrease in waist circumference of 2.91 cm. These findings are supported by other studies that showed a range of body fat loss from 1.9% to 3.9% after 12-week and 24-week pedometer-based interventions [21, 23, 32] . This research showed that there was an increase in skeletal muscle of 1.67% (equivalent to 1.18 kg). However, a limitation of this study is that it only measured whole-body skeletal muscle percentage. In other studies, 10-week walking programs showed significant increases in muscle mass on the thighs and calves of older adults [33] . Walking programs also prevent the expansion of adipose tissue in muscles, thus reducing muscle mass and, consequently, strength [34] . Multiple researchers have shown a relationship between low muscle mass and impaired physical function in older adults [35] . The aging process tends to involve increased muscle lipid content [35] , leading to reduced muscle mass, which is an independent risk factor for mobility limitations. The reduction of muscle mass has an effect on muscle strength and increases the risk of disability, potentially resulting in functional limitations of mobility [36] .",

            "text": "The limitations of the study are related to its quasi-experimental study design. This design is prone to biases, specifically selection bias, regression to the mean, instrumentation bias, and the Hawthorne effect [37] . Selection bias probably resulted in the inclusion of highly motivated individuals. A high level of motivation could explain the increased walking activity among the participants, which often exceeded the recommended 7000 steps per day. The Hawthorne effect refers to changed behavior in participants simply due to the effects of being observed during the intervention [38] . Therefore, these biases may exaggerate the effectiveness of the program. The second limitation is that the program only included a PA intervention, rather than a combination of diet and PA. Combined interventions usually result in more weight loss than PA interventions alone. The third limitation relates to the loss of some participants to follow-up. Twelve participants withdrew from the intervention group and eight in the control group. Phone interviews revealed that most participants withdrew due to schedule conflicts resulting from the study being conducted over a school holiday (in December). None of the participants who withdrew reported having an adverse event as a result of the intervention. As part of the safety protocol of the study, medical examinations were conducted and health records were reviewed by a team of researchers.",
