The correlation coefficients of shifted curves are large (> 0.9 for juveniles versus adults on the country level) which indicates that aside from the phase shift the sub-populations follow a similar epidemic dynamics. Negative phase shifts of the children's incidence curves during the first and second epidemic waves are predictors for high incidences during the current fourth wave with respect to the corresponding districts.",
