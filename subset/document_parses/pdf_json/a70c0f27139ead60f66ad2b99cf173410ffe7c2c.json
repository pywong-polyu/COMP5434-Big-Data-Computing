We have developed spatial panel models to assess the search and matching process with a particular focus on spatial spillovers. In general, spatial models may provide different findings than regular panel models regarding returns to scale in matching technology. Moreover, we have identified global spillover effects as well as other factors that impact the job-worker matching. We underline the role of data on job vacancies: the data retrieved from commercial job portals produced much more reliable estimates than underestimated registered data.",

Large cities are surrounded by minor counties the function of which is often to provide shelter and basic services to people who work in the city and spend there most of their daytime. However, these surrounding counties are not homogenous, and may strongly differ in their socio-economic development and functions. They formed more or less self-sufficient enclaves that are somehow dependent on its large metropolitan neighbor.",

In the research we employed unique data on job vacancies derived directly from the most substantial Polish internet job portals. We focus on the Pozna\u0144 agglomeration (Poland)-one of the largest metropolitan areas in Poland that consists of 18 counties (LAU level 2). LAU2 (formerly NUTS5) is the smallest administrative unit to divide the territory of the European Union. It includes municipalities, agglomerations or communes (Eurostat).",

It is also a workhorse of a regional economy with the dominant industries of construction, services, trade, and logistics. The Pozna\u0144 agglomeration is also a highly international place with the Amazon distribution warehouse, Volkswagen Factory, Carlsberg, Bertelsmann, among many others. Pozna\u0144 has a record-breaking low-level of the unemployment rate that dropped to 1.1% in December 2019. As a result, one of the major problems of local employers was worker shortages (Manpower Group 2020). The distance from the central city to the boundaries of the agglomeration does not exceed 25 km. The metropolitan area is connected with the surrounding counties through an extensive railway and bus network. This situation is beneficial to commuters which can travel relatively easy to their workplaces (Bul 2014) . It is also worth noting that despite the undoubtful economic domination of the core unit, some small but strong local economic centers can also be pointed out. This is because many large enterprises are located outside the metropolitan area (e.g. in Tarnowo",

Among the most influential research is the paper by Kosfeld (2007) . The author focused on German regions and proved that matching function coefficients estimations are not stable over space. In that case, the larger coefficient of a spatial lag in a given region is connected with higher mobility. Among later studies, the paper by Lottmann (2012) needs to be mentioned. The author applies the spatial matching function to the German labor market, makes use of data from 176 labor offices, and provides evidence for spatial dependencies that affect the matching process on German labor markets. The results suggest significant spatial spillovers. This means that regional policy activities have consequences on a wider scale. Other comprehensive study of the German labor markets was done by Haller and Heuermann (2016). They estimate a regional matching function on NUTS3 geographical units and prove positive and significant effects of vacancies on matching. Other similar works that investigate the spatial process on the labor market are those by Fahr and Sunde (2006) for West Germany or Hujer et al.

In fact, the authors used census data on unemployment and vacancies to estimate the matching function across over 8000 wards of UK and Wales. They found that the cost connected with the distance of vacancy was relatively high. They also observed that workers were discouraged from applying for a job if they expected strong competition.

Secondly, we used a unique microdata set extracted with the developed Web Application Programming Interface 1 (API) script from popular internet job portals and Public Employment Service statistics (PES).

            "text": "The analysis of supply and demand on the labor market is one of the main research fields in labor economics. Although the recent theories of the labor market accept the heterogeneity of jobs and workers, they also pay attention to very different details of job/employee matching processes. Search theory of labor markets and a derivative matching function concept underline a complex and time-consuming seeking procedure between employers and unemployed persons. (e.g. Rogerson et al. 2005) . The crucial from the point of the matching function estimation is the quality of data. In all reported studies data are obtained from public employment services databases. However, public statistics methodology often assume that companies report the number of job vacancies voluntarily. 2 As a result, the most frequent bias in registered data is connected with its underestimation (e.g. Paull 2002 , Feng and Hu 2013 , Ga\u0142ecka-Burdziak 2016 -for the Polish case). Additionally, for such reasons as saving time, money or just too much effort, data are usually reported with a frequency of a month, a quarter or even a year (Scott and Varian 2014) . Other common problems result from a delay in obtaining the data. We get job vacancies statistics every month but in fact, we do not know what is happening between these time points. The situation in Poland is unfavorable as Public Employment Service presents only stock data at the end of each month. Some of these job offers were reported a long time ago but because of high turnover or other issues they are available in registry for months. Such statistics may be perceived as obsolete and not well suited to the reality of a highly dynamic labor market. The last but not least is a bias associated with a specific type of job vacancies that are registered in labor offices. The jobs are often addressed to low-skilled workers and the wage offer is usually equal or slightly higher than the minimum wage in Poland (Roszkowska et al. 2017) . Sztandar-Sztanderska (2017) on the basis of qualitative research claims that PES in Poland is marked with institutional and organizational instability, limited human resources, insufficient spending on labor market programs. This state of affairs discourages employers from contacting labor offices and register the vacancies through the complicated, timeconsuming procedure. Because of that, the number of registered unemployed persons that find the job within a given month often exceeds the number of vacancies registered during this time (Tyrowicz 2014; Nagel 2016) .",

This can be explained by the greater willingness of employers to hire workers during higher supply of labor.

We can distinguish three general types of spatial matrices which can be included in the model specification. They are based on the construction of checker and figure moves; thus we have the Rooks matrix, Bishops matrix, and Queens matrix (Chen 2012) . In the case of the Rooks matrix, interaction with horizontal and vertical neighbors is considered; the Bishops matrix includes neighbors lying in diagonal fields, and the Queens matrix captures interactions with all neighboring regions. There are many more types of spatial weight matrices: geographical (distance or based on travel time), socioeconomic (based on relative trade, commuting flows, or similar measures), based on the order of neighbors or simply across borders (Vega and Elhorst 2015) . The spatial weight matrix is also one of the most criticized elements of econometric models because it is pre-defined and the estimation procedure does not influence the matrix weights (Arbia and Fingleton 2008) .

The intensities of spatial relations are defined by some preset rules that are usually based on contiguity or distance (Anselin 2001; Getis and Aldstadt 2010) . The choice of the matrix used in computations is often quite arbitrary (Vega and Elhorst 2013) . To incorporate the spatial information into the model, we construct different spatial weights matrices-we developed three common types of spatial matrices that were included in our models. The first was a neighbors-based Queens style contiguity matrix, thus interactions with all neighbors are defined. The second was distance-based matrix that included three nearest spatial locations for each centroid. The last matrix (a hybrid of distance approach) was graph-based, where the neighbor relationships are defined by the triangulation, which extends outwards to the convex hull of the points and which is planar (as defined in spdep R package by Bivand (2018)). The Queens matrix assumes that workers freely roam the local labor market with no preferences on the localization of job vacancies. In turn, distance-based and graph-based matrices assume that workers prefer jobs which are closer to where they live. The first type of spatial relations may involve higher transactional costs (time, money, etc.) which however may be compensated by e.g. a higher salary. In turn, the second type has lower costs which may be preferable in the case of having a low-paid job or other obligations (e.g. children, family, etc.).",

We used two common procedures for calculating the strength of spatial dependencies in the Pozna\u0144 agglomeration. Moran's I measure and Geary's C test. We use the Monte Carlo simulation approach for computing both: Moran's and Geary's statistics. MC proved statistics effectiveness (Ren et al. 2014 ). In that case values are randomly assigned to the polygons, and the measures of spatial correlation are computed. This is repeated several times to establish the distribution of expected values. The observed values (Moran's I and Geary's C) are then compared with the simulated distribution to see how likely it is that they do not co-vary. The results of Moran's I and Geary's C tests for the unemployment rate and vacancies ratio are reported in Table 3 . Similarly, as Galecka et al. (2017) proved, spatial interactions are stronger for stock than for inflows 6 in the case of Poland. The dependency is also visible in our dataset (Table 3 )-correlations are significant rather for the unemployment rate than the vacancies inflow rate. According to p-values, Global Moran's and Geary's tests show weak positive spatial correlation for the unemployment rate in the Pozna\u0144 agglomeration. In turn, both job vacancy rates seem to be randomly distributed in space and do not follow spatial patterns. The results, however, strongly depend on the kind of spatial matrix used in computations (e.g. according to Moran's I computed with a distance-based matrix there is evidence for weak, positive spatial correlation also in the case of both vacancy rates).",

Such indicators detect clusters of similar values around a particular location or identify areas that do not follow the global trend.

This means that pale colors are surrounded by dissimilar values that occur near one another. The north-eastern cluster shows significant clustering for the unemployment rate in the agglomeration. On the other hand, the southwestern cluster contributes negatively to the autocorrelation outcome and is surrounded by units of dissimilar values. The Getis-Ord Gi statistic (Ord and Getis 1995) looks at neighbors within a defined proximity to identify where either high or low values cluster spatially (Fig. 5) .

The inflow of new vacancies is not significant in that case; thus, we focus on the analysis of the output of models estimated with combined data (PES data on unemployment + commercial job portals data on vacancies). Therefore, the SAR, SLX, SDEM and panel fixed-effects models identified the spatial matching function which exhibits strictly decreasing returns to scale.

It means that an increasing inflow of unemployment and vacancies by 1% would result in an increase in new matches by ~ 0.17% and ~ 0.21% respectively. This finding may reflect the situation on the local labor market. Ultimately, the low unemployment rate of 1.1% and a high demand for workers force the employers to trade with the inflow of the newly unemployed rather than with the stock that consists of persons that are not well-motivated or unable to start work. Therefore, new matches result from worker turnover, migrants from other regions and countries, and those entering the labor market from the inactivity zone.",

Our analysis focused on the one of the largest urban areas in Poland (Pozna\u0144 agglomeration) that consists of 17 small spatial units of the LAU2 class. We proved the existence of spatial autocorrelation and identified the clusters that significantly contribute positively and negatively to the unemployment rate. We therefore extend studies on labor market spatial correlation by adding the analysis of small spatial units which have not been the object of studies so far. We also contribute by the analysis of the spatial panel matching function on the urban labor market with a unique dataset combined with the registered data on unemployment and commercial data on job adds.",

In effect, we were able to produce further conclusions on the basis of the models estimated with the data on job vacancies extracted from commercial job portals. In addition, if we were only to follow the estimates of the pooled models, we would confirm the common finding of the existence of the CRS matching function also at the low level of spatial aggregation (as identified by both pooled models). However, the estimated spatial models exhibit decreasing returns to scale (DRS) and this finding goes along with the hypothesis of exaggerating the role of the CRS matching function (e.g. Yashiv (2006) or Kangasharju et al.

These additional factors may be particularly important because of permanent worker shortages on the local labor market. One should remember that our analysis was carried out for the specific urban labor market that was characterized by the record-low unemployment level (~ 1.5% on average) and a high demand for workers. In fact, in 2018-2019, workforce shortage was the largest problem on the local labor market (LMO 2020). Moreover, under an extremely low unemployment rate firms are not likely to unthinkingly post new vacancies-a job add is an additional cost which might not return. Hence, the positive sign of cross-correlation between these two variables. As a result, creativity counts and various search behaviors are used in order to find a trading partner.",
