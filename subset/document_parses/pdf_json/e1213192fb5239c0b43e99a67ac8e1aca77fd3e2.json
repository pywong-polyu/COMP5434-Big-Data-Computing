Respiratory infectious viruses may be released in the air, resulting in cross-infection between patients and medical workers. Indoor ventilation systems can be adjusted to affect fine particles containing viruses. This study was aimed at performing a series of experiments to evaluate the ventilation performance and assess the exposure of healthcare workers (HW) to virus-laden particles released by patients in a confined experimental chamber. In a typical ward setting, four categories (top supply and exhaust, side supply and exhaust) were evaluated, encompassing 16 different air distribution patterns. The maximum reduction in the cumulative exposure level for HW was 70.8% in ventilation strategy D (upper diffusers on the sidewall supply and lower diffusers on the same sidewall return). The minimum value of the cumulative exposure level for a patient close to the source of the contamination pertained to Strategy E (upper diffusers on the sidewall supply and lower diffusers on the opposite sidewall return). Lateral ventilation strategies can provide significant guidance for ward operation to minimizing the airborne virus contamination. This study can provide a reference for sustainable buildings to construct a healthy indoor environment.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has considerably affected the sustainable development of cities and societies and raised concerns regarding the influence of regulated indoor environments on human health. Many infected patients have been hospitalized to seek medical care. Through testing, most of these patients were found to be carriers of the infectious virus through testing and were thus sent to the hospitals for quarantine treatment. However, certain infected patients who did not exhibit any notable symptoms likely engaged in social activities in public places. Therefore, ensuring social distancing in public places is particularly important to control the spread of the virus (Su et al., 2021; Sun, & Zhai, 2020) . To alleviate the problem of insufficient hospital beds caused by an excessive number of patients being sent to hospitals for treatment, Wuhan, as one of the cities severely affected by the pandemic, established 16 square cabin hospitals for treating patients with mild symptoms (Fang et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Wuhan's temporary hospitals, which resemble a centralized clinic with diagnostic functions, can accommodate thousands of beds.",

The following ventilation systems have been recommended for hospital wards: DV, downward ventilation and MV (Qian, Li, Nielsen, & Hyldgaard, 2008; Yau, Chandrasegaran, & Badarudin, 2011) . Qian and colleagues (Qian et al., 2006; Qian & Li, 2010) studied three different ventilation systems, including MV, downward ventilation and DV, to control the exhaled droplet nuclei of patients. The spatial distribution of the corresponding concentration was measured. The authors experimentally and computationally investigated the fate of breathing particles in a full-size, six-bed isolation chamber with vents at various locations. The results showed that the existing ventilation design of isolation chambers is not completely effective in removing fine and large breathing particles. Studies have suggested that increasing the ventilation rates to reduce the possibility of infection transmission may incur higher energy and financial costs. Therefore, this study suggests an intelligent and low-cost risk control strategy that combines infection prevention with energy conservation (Wang, Huang, Feng, Cao & Haghighat, 2021) .",

In these articles (Ai et al., 2019; Cao et al., 2015; Liu, Li, Nielsen, Wei & Jensen, 2017; Manuel Villafruela, Castro, Francisco San Jose & Saint-Martin, 2013; Olmedo et al., 2012; Qian et al., 2006) , the influence of different ventilation and filtration systems on the pollutant control was reported. The studies were primarily aimed at examining different air distribution patterns (DV, MV, and protected area ventilation), ventilation frequencies (ACH), and different relative positions between patients and infected persons that corresponded to a high risk of infection transmission. However, these studies did not examine the effects of exposure to infection when the return vent was near the source of the contamination. To the best of our knowledge, extremely few experimental studies have focused on the relative location of the return air outlet and the patient's respiratory area.",

Therefore, in this mode, the return air inlets are closer to the patients' respiratory area than in other ventilation modes. Fong et al. conducted experimental studies on the thermal sensation in MV, DV and stratified ventilation rooms. Compared with MV and DV, floor ventilation consumed less energy (Fong, Lin, Fong, Chow & Yao, 2011) . Lin et al. studied the particle dispersion in classrooms under DV and stratified ventilation under three typical scenarios through a numerical simulation. The results of the study showed that the concentration of particulate matter in the respiratory zone was significantly lower than that in DV. These findings indicated that the risk of pathogenic bacteria inhalation in ground ventilation was lower than that in DV (Lin, Wang, Yao & Chow, 2012) . Moreover, several studies (Cheng & Lin, 2015; Tian, Lin & Wang, 2010) were conducted on stratified ventilation, including the examination of the thermal comfort assessment, indoor stratified ventilation airflow characteristics, and transmission and infection performance in the classroom. The results showed that compared with MV and DV, stratified ventilation corresponded to a smaller blowing sensation, higher thermal comfort and more energy savings. Notable, the existing research on layered ventilation has mainly focused on the thermal comfort and energy consumption among other aspects, and extensive and targeted experimental research has not been conducted on its impact on the pollutant removal, especially in terms of the exposure of medical staff.",

Effects of the P-exhaled contaminants on different exposures to infection among Ps in multiple wards were examined. Third, based on the results of the study, the optimal ventilation mode that could rapidly discharge pollutants from the P's breathing zone in the event of an infectious disease and to reduce the risk of cross-infection during the implementation of isolation in the space was determined. The experimental database including the temperature, air velocity and fine particle distribution under different ventilation systems provided in this study can be used to verify the numerical simulation results in further studies. To quantify the transport of particles generated by Ps, two experimental scenarios were considered. The first scenario was aimed at assessing the effect of particles generated by Ps on HWs. The second scenario was designed to study the transport of particles generated by a P to other Ps in the same hospital ward. In the two experimental scenarios, different numbers of dummy mannequins were used to simulate the human body.

Under the given laboratory conditions, we conducted two kinds of experiments, namely, static and dynamic experiments. The static experiment was conducted to test the attenuation effect of different ventilation systems on the fine particulate matter with different particle sizes. In this experiment, the measurement points were arranged in the respiratory areas of the P and HW, the indoor central point (IC) and the location of the return air outlet, and the process monitoring and recording were conducted for these measurement points. The test steps were as follows: First, fine particulate matter was generated indoors. A certain amount of sandalwood dust was used to simulate the release of fine particulate matter indoors. In the static test, the particles were produced by the burning of sandalwood. The burning process was strictly timed to ensure that the same number of equisized particles were produced. The dominate aerodynamic diameter of the particles produced by sandalwood combustion was between 0.3 and 10.0 \u03bcm. In the static experiment, the particles were released through combustion at the center of the indoor ground. Second, four stirring fans were operated to ensure a uniform particle distribution. In different locations of the room, the number of particles was continuously monitored by operating the fans for different durations, and the distribution of the particles was confirmed to be uniform through analysis. Each process of the experiment was subjected to strict time control. Third, the fine particles in the room were allowed to decay naturally and under different ventilation conditions. In addition, the experiment was repeated multiple times. The complete process lasted at least two hours.",

Each combustion process was time-controlled to ensure that the same size and number of equalized particles were produced. The sandalwood material adopted in the dynamic experiment was the same as that used in the static experiment; however, the shape, height and burn time of the sandalwood were different due to the consideration of the distance between the P's respiratory area and its surrounding location. The particles were burned and released at the position of P's mouth. The pollution source (P's mouth) released pollutants (fine particles) into the room. In the singleroom simulation experiment, a P (blue dummy) and an HW (white dummy) were considered, as shown in Fig. 4 .

Fig. 8 shows the ventilation effect of the ventilation systems. Strategies A, B, D, and E exhibit a high ventilation performance, while Strategies C, F, and G exhibit a low ventilation performance. As far as P is concerned, Strategy A corresponds the highest ventilation efficiency, followed by Strategy D. The result for Strategy A may be attributed to the rapid air exchange rate in P's respiratory area when the air returns at the top of the top supply air, and thus, the ventilation effect in the respiratory area is high. The result of Strategy D can be attributed to the side supply air and side return air. The duration of such airflows is small, and the airflow distance is small. In terms of the location of the HW, Strategy E exhibits the highest ventilation efficiency, followed by Strategy B, likely because the distance between the return air outlet and HW is small and the airflow distance is small. The reason for the higher k value in Strategies D and E may be thatin these strategies, clean air is sent to the room through upper diffusers on the sidewall (diffusers close to the breathing area), owing to which the air near the breathing area is promptly refreshed.",

In another study, the test result of CADR (m 3 /h) was approximately 300-700. In this study, (Ren & Liu, 2019) , CADR of the same significance could be obtained by using the k value. Since the volume of the experimental chamber was 5.92 m \u00d7 6.0 m \u00d7 2.8 m=99.5 m 3 , the value of CADR could be calculated to be 500-1600 m 3 /h.
