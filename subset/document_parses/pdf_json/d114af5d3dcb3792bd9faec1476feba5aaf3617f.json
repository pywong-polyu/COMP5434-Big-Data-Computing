The human-like interaction between the computer and the user supported by multiple modal technology has been applied in educational technology for a long time, especially in the field of pedagogical agent and intelligent tutoring system (Jia 2015) . Johnson and Lester (2018) expected that the anthropomorphic and natural interaction between the pedagogical agent and the student could make the learning easier, more motivating and more participatory. A pedagogical agent is a human-like animation or avatar in a multimedia leaning system, and can support the student's learning by playing part of an expert, a teacher, a tutor, or a friend, which can give a lecture, suggestion, or question (Liew et al. 2017; Schroeder and Adesope 2014) . The most played roles by the pedagogical agent include tutors, teachers and trainers, but seldom learning companion, as found by some systematic reviews (Poria et al. 2017; Terzidou et al. 2016) .",

(1997) explained the function of a pedagogical agent as persona effect based on the experiment, and believed that the human-like agent, even with a weaker interaction function, could effectively promote the learning. Social presence was first proposed by Short et al. (1976) , and defined by Gunawardena (1995) and Lowenthal (2009) as the extent how a virtual agent is regarded as a real human that communicates and connects with the agent. Social clues expressed by a pedagogical agent in a multimedia learning environment like the voice, emotion and facial expression can inspire the learners' social contact schema (Louwerse et al. 2009 ). This argument was evidenced by the fMRI research conducted by Schilbach et al. (2006) . If the social contact schema is stimulated, the learner can process the information coming from the computer deeply and facilitate the more meaningful learning (Mayer and DaPra 2012) . Nass and Moon (2000) found more similarity between the computer and the human being can stimulate more social contact of the human users.",

Graesser and his research team applied LSA (Latent Semantic Analysis) and other natural language processing technology in designing intelligent tutoring systems that talk with the student via text or spoken voice in dialogue or trialogue form (Graesser 2016; Graesser et al. 2018) . Lepper and Chabay (1988) found through classroom observations the teachers spent almost as much time on the students to help them with the affective goals as with the knowledge goal. The latest advancement of multimodal emotion recognition and micro emotion recognition improves the performance of affective computing (Wu et al. 2016) . Recently the design of pedagogical agents to simulate the human teachers in affective intervention has been a research trend. From the perspective of multimedia learning, the pedagogical agent which can identify learners' emotions can effectively convey more social clues. Positive emotions can help learners focus on current tasks, motivate the learners, and improve the learning effect (Pekrun 2006) . Liew et al. (2017) found through the meta-analysis about 30 experiments that the usage of emotional recognition and expression can improve the students' learning motivation, knowledge retention and knowledge transformation.",

For this functionality the continuance of facial identification is an important indicator for the student's concentration status of facing the screen.

In the left division, the live video lecture with the lecturer's speech was synchronously displayed to the student, for example, Jack, while in the right division, the learning companion Emina was watching the student' facial expression. Besides, the companion expressed the same emotion with the student. If the student looked happy by watching the lecture, Emina would also looked happy. If the student watched the video in full screen, the companion Emina was hidden, but was still watching the student. If the student left the screen for one minute, Emina would spoke \"Where are you now, Jack?\". The second example is a tutoring system with the MMISE (Zhang and Jia 2017) . The student should input the answers either by clicking the correct one in the multiple choices or fill in the blanks in a given time period, for example in 10 min for the drill, because some students lag behind the required drill duration according to our previous analysis of online learners' drilling behavior (Le and Jia 2018) . If the student does not click the mouse or type the keyboard during the given time, the MMISE should alert the student. Furthermore, it should determine the concrete output format, either spoken voice, text or animation. If it detects that the student leaves the screen for a longer time, it should give out spoken text. If the student doesn't leave the screen, the MMISE should keep quiet for a quiz writing system, but function as a tutor with appropriate hints or help in the format text, voice or animation for a tutoring system. Figure 3 shows the screenshot of one online math tutoring system with the learning companion Christoph recognizing the user's face. In this case, the MMISE could be embedded into the dialogue program to enhance the agent effect, and some important issues regarding the voice, the avatar gender and features should be considered, as suggested in the literature review.",

It can be embedded in an existing webpage or realized in an independent webpage located in an https webserver server. For face detection, we use the SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector) model, which computes the locations of each face in an image and returns the bounding boxes together with its probability for each face. The size of the quantized detection model is about 5.4 MB. For face landmark detection, we use the 68 point face landmark detector. The default model file has a size of only 350 kb. For face recognition, a ResNet-34 like architecture is implemented to compute a face descriptor (a feature vector with 128 values) from any given face image, which is used to describe the characteristics of a person's face. We determine the similarity of two arbitrary faces by computing the Euclidean distance. The model achieves a prediction accuracy of 99.38% on the LFW (Labeled Faces in the Wild) benchmark for face recognition. The size of the quantized recognition model is roughly 6.2 MB.

            "text": "We also applied the program in a web-based intelligent mathematics instruction system for school pupils, \"Lexue 100\" (https://www.lexue100.com), with the Chinese meaning Happy Learning for 100%. It is a web-based intelligent instruction system for school mathematics, developed by Beijing Lexue 100 Online Education Co., Ltd., and equipped with the OLAI model proposed by the authors' team (Jia and Yu 2017) . More than 70,000 quizzes have been designed for the different versions of mathematics textbooks that are used in different provinces and metropolis in China. Writing quizzes is the main learning activity in this system. Each quiz is composed of a series of gapfilling or single-choice questions with predefined standard answers. As soon as one student submits the trial answer to the system, the trial answer can be compared with the standard answer, and the corresponding quiz score and feedback are instantly provided to the student. Users are allowed to pass the quiz only if every answer gets right, meaning that if the first try of one student is wrong, the student will have to try again until the answer hits the point. As we analyzed in previous studies (Jia and Zhang 2019) , the school students, especially the students with learning difficulties, are easy to lose their concentration by writing the quiz alone at home, and may copy the answer from other classmates. The learning avatars facilitated with MMISE are embedded in the quiz activity, just like those shown in the above examples, and can improve the student's concentration on the quiz by watching the student's face, and giving appropriate help hints.",
