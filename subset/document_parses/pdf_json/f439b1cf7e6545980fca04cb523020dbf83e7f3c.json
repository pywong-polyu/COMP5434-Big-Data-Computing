Multiple safety measures were introduced in the last decades, strongly accelerated by the recognition of HIV transfusion transmission in the early 1980s, significantly decreasing the risk for infectious adverse events. However, there is still a remaining risk for the recipients of labile blood components, considering the limitations of existing safety measures [1] . Newly emerging pathogens, particularly viruses, may pose a challenge to the safety of plasma transfusion, especially if subclinical infection occurs in combination with blood viremia. The majority of individuals infected by one of the recently emerging arboviruses develop no symptoms but may carry a high titre viral load in the blood [1, 2] . The emergence and risk for the blood supply caused by emerging infectious diseases are unpredictable [3] , as demonstrated by the current COVID-19 pandemic.",

The highly virulent pathogen causing the disease was identified as a beta-Coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) [5] . On 11 March 2020, the WHO declared a global COVID-19 pandemic, up to date more than 47 million confirmed infections and more than 1\u00c12 million disease-related deaths have been reported globally, with highest disease burden in Europe and the Americas, followed by the Middle East and Asia. In Saudi Arabia, more than 348 000 confirmed cases and more than 5000 disease-related deaths have been reported up to date according to the WHO COVID-19 Dashboard [6] . Respiratory droplets were quickly identified as the main route of infection, other ways of transmission, especially smear infection/oral intake, may also play a role [7] . Not every infected individual develops the COVID-19 disease, the prevalence of asymptomatic infected individuals has been reported by several studies [7, 8] including a study from South Korea that reported a prevalence of 19\u00c12% [9]. SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to other human coronaviruses, especially SARS-CoV which caused an outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome in Singapore and Korea in 2000-2002. By decision of the International Committee for the Taxonomy of Viruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 are different strains of the same species [5] . Transmission by blood transfusion was not shown for SARS-CoV, however, due to the detection of viral genomes in blood in the symptomatic phase, and the detection of SARS-CoV genomes in leucocytes in the convalescent phase together with evidence for subclinical infection, transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV is of concern and considered a theoretical risk [10] . Evidence for subclinical infection was also shown for SARS-CoV-2 [7] . Low viral load SARS-CoV-2 RNAemia in blood was detected frequently in symptomatic patients [11, 12] . A recent study from China reported SARS-CoV RNAemia also in asymptomatic blood donors; viral nucleic acids were detected retrospectively in frozen plasma products, a platelet product and donor samples for pre-screening [13] . Although transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is not documented to date, the detection of viral nucleic acids in blood products from asymptomatic donors raises concerns about potential transfusion transmission of SARS-CoV-2, especially because blood screening procedures for that pathogen are not established yet. Another potential risk became evident in light of the recent approaches to use convalescent donors' plasma to treat COVID-19 patients, an idea that seems to be one of the most promising therapeutic approach to date [14] .",

The increased improvement in the performance of screening assays was very helpful in reducing transmission risks.

During a photochemical reaction involving amotosalen (the photoactive compound) and UVA light, the pathogens' genomes are modified in a targeted and specific manner by cross-linking the genomic strands, preventing transcription and replication without affecting the clinical outcome of the plasma transfusion [19, 20] . This was also shown in a cohort of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) patients requiring therapeutic plasma exchange [21, 22] . As an additional effect, residual white blood cells of the donor are inactivated more efficiently than by gamma-irradiation [23] , reducing the risk for immunological transfusion reactions and transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GvHD). Efficient inactivation by amotosalen/UVA treatment of the very closely related SARS-CoV was reported in human plasma units and platelet concentrates [24, 25] . We also recently have shown that amotosalen/UVA treatment can efficiently inactivate the closely related Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in human plasma [26] and platelet concentrates [27] , and now extending this work to evaluate the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 in human therapeutic plasma units.

For further confirmation, we determined the genomic viral load from supernatants collected from all passages inoculated with either pretreatment or post-treatment samples.

No CPE and no genomic viral load were detectable after 3 consecutive rounds of passaging on Vero E6 cells, pointing towards complete inactivation. The reported genomic viral load in the blood of symptomatic patients and asymptomatic donors is relatively low, often close to the limit of detection [11] [12] [13] 29] , pointing towards sufficient inactivation efficacy of amotosalen/UVA to prevent potential transfusion transmission (Table 2) .",

The PCR detects a beta-coronavirus specific target (E-gene), a SARS-CoV-2 specific target (S-gene) and an internal control. The decrease in viral load was expressed by comparing the cycle threshold (CT) values from each sample relative to the CT values of the pretreatment inoculated sample (with the SARS-CoV-2 specific primers). The SARS-CoV-2 titres were expressed as PFU equivalents per ml (PEq/ml) using a standard curve (standard: serial dilutions of the viral stock) and choosing dilutions of the original sample (10 -1 to 10 -8 ) with CT values in the exponential phase. Each run included a positive viral template control and no-template negative control. Each sample was tested in duplicate, and the mean is reported as PEq/ml.",
