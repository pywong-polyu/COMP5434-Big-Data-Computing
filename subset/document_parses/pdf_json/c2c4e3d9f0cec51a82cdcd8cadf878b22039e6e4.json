Early estimates of the epidemic growth and incubation period of COVID-19 may have been biased due to sample selection. Using detailed case reports from 14 locations in and outside mainland China, we obtained 378 Wuhan-exported cases who left Wuhan before an abrupt travel quarantine. We developed a generative model we call BETS for four key epidemiological events-Beginning of exposure, End of exposure, time of Transmission, and time of Symptom onset (BETS)-and derived explicit formulas to correct for the sample selection. We gave a detailed illustration of why some early and highly influential analyses of the COVID-19 pandemic were severely biased. All our analyses, regardless of which subsample and model were being used, point to an epidemic doubling time of 2 to 2.5 days during the early outbreak in Wuhan. A Bayesian nonparametric analysis further suggests that about 5% of the symptomatic cases may not develop symptoms within 14 days of infection and that men may be much more likely than women to develop symptoms within 2 days of infection.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "On December 31, 2019, the Health Commission in Wuhan, China, announced 27 cases of unknown viral pneumonia and alerted the World Health Organization.

The regional outbreak in Wuhan quickly turned into a global pandemic. As of April 15, 2020, COVID-19 has reached almost every country in the world, infected at least 2 million people, and killed at least 130,000 [2] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 299, "end": 302, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 517, "end": 520, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Researchers around the world quickly responded to the COVID-19 outbreak. In particular, many have examined early outbreak data to estimate the initial epidemic growth, using COVID-19 cases confirmed in Wuhan or elsewhere. Two early studies published in premier medical journals by the end of January estimated that the epidemic doubling time in Wuhan was about 6 to 7 days [17, 28] , but other studies appearing around the same time found that the doubling time was drastically shorter, about 2 to 3 days [23, 25, 29] . How the pandemic subsequently developed around the world seems to suggest that the latter estimates were much closer to truth. By simply plotting the cumulative cases and deaths over time, it is evident now that the number of cases (and deaths) grew more than 100 times 20 days after the first 100 cases (and 10 deaths) in countries most heavily hit by the pandemic such as Italy, Spain, and the United States ( Figure 1 ). That growth rate almost exactly corresponds to a doubling time of 3 days. Nevertheless, to our knowledge there is no formal explanation for this drastic difference, and it might have caused confusion during the early phase of containment of COVID-19. For example, during the UK government's daily briefing on March 16, it was acknowledged that \"without drastic action, cases could double every five or six days\" [3] .

Second, although the contact tracing for travelers from Wuhan was intensive in the locations included in our dataset, some degree of underascertainment of Wuhan-exported cases is perhaps inevitable. If patients who showed symptoms earlier were less likely to be ascertained, our analysis may have over-estimated the speed of the epidemic growth. Third, the discernment of Wuhan-exported cases in Section 2.2 is not perfect; for example, there is ambiguity about where some COVID-19 cases were infected if they both had stayed in Wuhan and were exposed to other confirmed cases after their stay. Another potential limitation is the core assumptions that the disease transmission and progression are independent of traveling. This assumption is necessary to extend the conclusions from a \"shadow\" of the epidemic (Wuhan-exported cases) to the center of the outbreak, but it can be violated if, for example, some people canceled travel plans due to feeling sick.
