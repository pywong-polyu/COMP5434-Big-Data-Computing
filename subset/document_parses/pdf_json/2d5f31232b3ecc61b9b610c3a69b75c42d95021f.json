Activation of the contact system and intrinsic pathway has increasingly been implicated in the prothrombotic state observed in both sterile and infectious inflammatory conditions. We thus sought to assess activation of the contact system and intrinsic pathway in subjects with COVID-19 infection. Baseline plasma levels of protease:serpin complexes indicative of activation of the contact and intrinsic pathways were measured in samples from inpatients with COVID-19 and healthy individuals. Cleaved kininogen, a surrogate for bradykinin release, was measured by ELISA, while extrinsic pathway activation was assessed by microvesicle tissue factor-mediated factor Xa generation (MVTF). Samples were collected within 24 hours of COVID-19 diagnosis. Thirty patients with COVID-19 and thirty age-and sex-matched controls were enrolled. Contact system and intrinsic pathway activation in COVID-19 were demonstrated by increased plasma levels of factor XIIa:C1 esterase inhibitor (FXIIa:C1), kallikrein:C1, FXIa:C1, FXIa: 1antitrypsin, and FIXa:antithrombin (FIXa:AT). MVTF levels were also increased in COVID-19 subjects. Since FIXa:AT levels were associated with both contact/intrinsic pathway complexes and MVTF, activation of FIX likely occurs through both the contact/intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Among the protease:serpin complexes measured, FIXa:AT complexes were uniquely associated with clinical indices of disease severity, specifically the total length of hospitalization, length of ICU stay, and extent of lung CT changes. We conclude that the contact/intrinsic pathway may contribute to the pathogenesis of the prothrombotic state in COVID-19. Larger prospective studies are required to confirm whether FIXa:AT complexes are a clinically useful biomarker of adverse clinical outcomes.",

Activation of coagulation in the context of infectious diseases has been long recognized as an integral part of the host response to pathogens 7, 8 , and involves a complex interplay of immune cells, coagulation factors and other bioactive compounds, that has been recently termed immunothrombosis. In the early phase of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, D-dimer was identified as a biomarker that correlates with disease severity 9, 10 . However, plasma Ddimer generation is dependent upon the both the coagulation and fibrinolytic systems, and as such, it does not address the mechanism of the coagulopathy in COVID-19. Tissue factor (TF) is a principal trigger of immunothrombosis in acute respiratory distress syndrome 11 , and plasma microvesicle-associated tissue factor activity (MVTF) has been demonstrated to correlate with mortality in respiratory viral infections 12 .",

Both factor XIa (FXIa) and kallikrein (PKa) can activate factor IX (FIX) following contact activation [18] [19] [20] , while the TF:FVIIa complex can also directly activate FIX 21 . Similarly, FXI may be activated not only by FXIIa, but also by thrombin. FXIa is irreversibly inactivated by several serpins, including C1 Inhibitor, \u03b11-antitrypsin and (in the presence of heparin) antithrombin, while kallikrein is primarily inactivated by C1. In turn, FIXa is primarily inactivated by antithrombin, forming a stable covalent FIXa:antithrombin (FIXa:AT) complex. Meticulous sampling technique and processing must be considered when evaluating plasma for these complexes, as the principal activator of the contact pathway, factor XII (FXII), undergoes accelerated autoactivation upon contact with an anionic surface 22 . While the growing interest in the contact pathway has raised the question of targeting its component proteins for the prevention of thrombotic complications 23, 24 , the laboratory characterization of these complexes as indices of coagulation activation continues to be challenging 15 .",

FIXa:AT levels correlated with other protease:serpin complexes in the contact pathway, particularly FXIIa:C1 (r s =0.54, P<.001) and FXIa:C1 (r s =0.41, P=.001), supporting the hypothesis that activation of the contact pathway contributes at least in part to the 'downstream' activation of FIX ( Figure 2 ). Of note, no differences were observed in FIXa:AT levels between patients allocated to any of the three treatment arms 27 , either on admission or at the end of treatment with study drug (day +4) (Supplemental Figure 1 ). These data support the fact that the experimental treatment arms had no influence on FIXa:AT levels. Lastly, we noted that 14 of the 30 enrolled patients received a single prophylactic 40 mg dose of enoxaparin before the baseline labs were obtained. However, neither the serine protease:serpin levels, nor any of the other biomarkers demonstrated any trends when comparing those who did vs. those did not receive enoxaparin (data not shown).",

Figure 4A demonstrates that MVTF activity was significantly elevated in COVID-19 patients compared to healthy individuals, albeit with significant overlap at lower or undetectable concentrations. However, MVTF activity was moderately, but significantly, correlated with circulating FIXa:AT complexes (R=0.45; P = 0.0006) ( Figure 4B ).

As shown in Table 4 , while a number of analytes were significantly associated with one or more of these outcomes, only a few were associated with all 3 outcomes. These included several candidate biomarkers that have previously been implicated as progostic biomarkers, including C-reactive protein 33 , D-dimer 34 , and PAI-1 35 .

In this exploratory study, circulating levels of protease:serpin complexes indicative of contact and intrinsic pathway activation were observed to be elevated in COVID-19 patients. We demonstrated that levels of the various FXIa:serpin complexes, and to a lesser extent PKa:C1 complexes, were positively correlated with FIXa:AT levels, suggesting that both FXIa and PKa might be contributing to FIX activation in vivo [18] [19] [20] . Furthermore, in agreement with previous reports 13, 32 , we observed that MVTF levels were also elevated at baseline and also correlated with levels of FIXa:AT, suggesting that the activation of FIX occurs via both the contact/intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. Whatever the mechanism of initial FIX activation, the resultant downstream thrombin generation may then activate FXI, thereby promoting further FIX activation 36 .",

            "text": "While activation of the contact pathway by bacterial infection has been described in humans and in animal models 24, 37 , few studies have investigated whether this pathway is activated in viral infection 38, 39 . Hyperinflammation associated with COVID-19 results in activation of innate immune cells (neutrophils and monocytes) that interact with platelets and the coagulation cascade, ultimately leading to micro-and macrothrombosis. The generation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) 40, 41 and/or release of platelet-derived polyphosphate 42 may promote activation of the contact pathway in COVID-19 during immunothrombosis in the microvasculature of the lung and other vascular beds. In addition to its contribution to thrombin generation, contact activation leads to an inflammatory cacade mediated by bradykinin as a product of PKa cleavage of HK. Indeed, the phrase 'bradykinin storm' was coined to describe the dysregulated generation of BK (and its metabolite des-Arg9-BK) in COVID-19 infection that may enhance pulmonary inflammation and increase vascular permeability 43, 44 . While the very short half-life of BK makes it challenging to measure directly in plasma, BK generation can be inferred by quantitation of the more stable cleaved form of HK (HKc) 28 . Our data suggest that in the early stages of infection, levels of HKc are significantly increased in COVID compared to healthy individuals, but this is accompanied by an increased concentration of the intact form of HK (HKi), likely as a compensatory response. This interpretation is compatible with other data shown here that increased zymogen levels of the other contact factors are also associated with elevated levels of the respective serine protease:serpin (for example, elevated FXII:C and increased FXIIa:C1 complexes were observed in the same samples).",

Along with D-dimer, CRP and PAI-1, the concentration of FIXa:AT complexes upon admission was associated with the total duration of hospitalization, duration of intensive care, and degree of lung injury assessed by the CT score. Although involvement of the contact pathway in SARS-CoV2 infection was suggested early in the pandemic [45] [46] [47] [48] , there are limited data linking activation of this pathway with patient outcomes 49, 50 This study has several limitations. First, the sample size is relatively small, although the differences in the levels of measured analytes between patients and healthy subjects are rather profound. Moreover, consecutive enrollment of a well-defined patient population, standardized sample collection with control of pre-analytical variables, and structured obtention of clinical and laboratory data in the setting of a randomized controlled trial served to minimize the inherent heterogeneity of observational studies that were conducted in the early phases of the pandemic. Second, we did not measure longitudinal trends in the selected analytes; however, our primary objective was to assess baseline levels of the contact activation markers and to preliminarily evaluate their clinical prognostic potential. Furthermore, we wished to avoid any confounding by treatment allocation that may have been operative at subsequent time points. Finally, while our study did not include a control group of patients with non-COVID pneumonia, it should be noted that the primary objective was not to determine whether any observed changes were specific to COVID-19. Rather, we sought to identify whether one or more of the measured analytes might be a novel prognostic indicator of adverse clinical outcomes. Indeed, our preliminary analysis suggests that baseline FIXa:AT complexes may have such prognostic significance. However, since it is difficult to conclude that a meaningful association exists between these laboratory parameters and clinical outcomes when the latter are <20, a larger appropriately powered prospective study is needed to validate this hypothesis.",
