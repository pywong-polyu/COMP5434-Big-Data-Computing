After being ingested by whiteflies, TYLCV virions can travel from the midgut lumen into the haemolymph, then move to the salivary gland with the flow of haemolymph and finally be inoculated into healthy plants with saliva excretion [5] . In this process, numerous genes are regulated in the whiteflies. Li et al. [16] and Luan et al. [17] suggested that acquisition of Tomato yellow leaf curl China virus (TYLCCNV) influenced the expression of many genes related to metabolism, cell cycle and immune reactions in whiteflies. Hasegawa et al. [18] and Geng et al. [19] also demonstrated that the infection of TYLCV induced transcriptional changes of the genes involved in cell cycle and antiviral immunity.

After a viral AAP of 12-48 h, the amount of viruses in whiteflies reached a very high level of abundance [23] . Gene expression of whiteflies were extensively studied to unravel the mechanisms of whitefly-virus interaction.

In this study, viral AAPs at 0 h, 2 h, 6 h, 12 h and 48 h were used for comparative transcriptome analysis to further explore the mechanisms in virus-vector interaction. Our work sought to answer the following two questions: (1) regardless of viral amounts, does gene regulation change in TYLCV-infected whiteflies; (2) does any temporally up-regulated or down-regulated genes or pathways exist in TYLCV-infected whiteflies?
