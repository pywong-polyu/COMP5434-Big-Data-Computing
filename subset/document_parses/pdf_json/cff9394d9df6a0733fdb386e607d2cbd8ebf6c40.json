However, the decrease in acute care resource use and mortality was observed overall and within age strata, suggesting that these decreases cannot be entirely explained by changing age distribution over time. There are several potential explanations for these observations. First, changes in clinical practice pattern may have resulted in reduced hospitalizations, utilization of critical care resources and shorter hospital stays.

(10) (11) (12) (13) Further, , data to support the use of prone positioning to improve oxygenation in non-intubated patients, and evidence supporting the use of dexamethasone began to emerge as the pandemic progressed.(14-16) Second, it is possible that mask use or other public health measures including physical distancing, have resulted in lower viral loads among infected individuals, which may be associated with reduced severity of illness.(17) Finally, the finding that there was a decrease in infected individuals who had high-risk comorbidities over time could be a function of greater awareness and protections in place to protect those at higher risk of severe outcomes, thereby decrease the risk level among the infected cases over time and thus the need for hospitalization and ICU care.",

The CCM Plus is an administrative dataset and is subject to underreporting and potential misclassification.(20,21). Testing policies and case definitions have changed between March and September 2020 in Ontario. For example, switch to appointment-only testing in September with stricter criteria means the data may capture more severe cases (and less severe cases), further complicating interpretation of the shifting outcomes.
