At first glance these patients seemed to have an \u00aboptimal\u00bb vaccine response, but on closer inspection we realized that we did not know their exact antibody level (because we had not diluted the reagent above 250U/ml for our measurements at V2M1). However, the studies by Berar Yanay, Simon and Grupper [1, 2, 3] show that HD patients present highly diminished SARS-CoV-2 S antibody titers compared to a cohort of controls. Simon and al, using the same assay as our team (with a dilution allowing measurements up to 2500 U/ml), find an average antibody titer of 170 U/ml in their whole cohort after 2 injections of the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine, widely below the average antibody titer of 3897 U/ml observed in our cohort (of initially hypo-responders\u2026) after the third injection. It is therefore necessary to consider all dialysis patients as low responders compared to the general population. In this context, trying to assess which dialysis patients would only require 2 doses seems delicate and potentially dangerous for this particularly fragile population. This attitude would waste time and would also require control serologies (currently not reimbursed in France).",

However, since 40% of our cohort had a suboptimal or even insufficient response, it seems lawful to offer the 3rd vaccine quickly to all dialysis patients. Based on our observations and lack of other similar studies, we feel that it makes sense to administer the 3rd vaccine 1 month after the 2nd dose.",

Among the 88 remaining patients, 71 patients initially presented a suboptimal response with antibody levels between 15 and 250 U/ml and 17 an insufficient response to vaccination. In this last group, 11 patients had a very weak seroconversion (titers below 15 U/ml) and 6 no seroconversion (levels below 0,8). It is also worth noting that none of those 88 patients had had any previous COVID infection. The 6 patients not showing seroconversion were vaccinated 2 months after the 2nd vaccine (schedule M0-M1-M3), all the other patients (82) received the 3rd dose at 3 months of the 2nd vaccine (schedule M0-M1-M4).
