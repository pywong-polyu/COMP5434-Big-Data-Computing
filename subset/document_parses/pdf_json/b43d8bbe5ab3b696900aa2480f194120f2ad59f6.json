Subsequently, her blood glucose levels gradually decreased, her metabolic acidosis was corrected, and her ketosis significantly improved. Diabetic ketoacidosis completely resolved 20 hours after admission, and she was transitioned to subcutaneous insulin therapy. A further examination revealed exhaustion of endogenous insulin secretion, a positive insulin autoantibody, and autoimmunity against the thyroid gland with normal levels of thyroid hormones (Table). Immunological tests showed no evidence of a recent viral infection potentially triggering type 1 diabetes (coxsackievirus, mumps virus, rubella virus, cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, human herpesvirus, and Epstein-Barr virus) and suggested vaccine-induced immunity against SARS-CoV-2 (Table) . Human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II genotyping indicated DRB1*09:01-DQB1*03:03 homozygosity, which is known to confer susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in the Japanese population (11, 12) . Based on these findings, she was diagnosed with acute-onset type 1 diabetes and achieved adequate glycemic control with a subcutaneous injection of insulin glargine U-300 (14 units) before supper and of insulin lispro before meals (6 units, 4 units, and 6 units before breakfast, lunch, and supper, respectively) at discharge.",

Abu-Rumaileh et al. (9) reported a case of new-onset type 2 diabetes presenting as hyperglycemic hyperosmolar syndrome that developed three weeks after the first dose of BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Since the patient was a 58-year-old African man with a family history of type 2 diabetes, the authors speculated that the vaccine had triggered an immune response to unmask the patient's underlying prediabetes (9). Patrizio et al. (10) reported a 52year-old man from Italy who showed new onset Graves' disease and the conversion of pre-existing type 2 diabetes into type 1 autoimmune diabetes that developed four weeks after the second dose of BNT162b2 SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. Based on the findings that the patient had a history of vitiligo vulgaris and evidence of autoimmunity to the thyroid gland and pancreatic islets, the authors speculated that the occurrence of these disorders could be explained partly by autoimmune/ inflammatory syndrome induced by adjuvants (ASIA syndrome) (13) . Although the causal relationship remains to be clarified, these cases suggest that the exposure to SARS-CoV-2 mRNA vaccine has the potential to activate autoimmune reaction to induce serious endocrine disorders in previously healthy individuals.",
