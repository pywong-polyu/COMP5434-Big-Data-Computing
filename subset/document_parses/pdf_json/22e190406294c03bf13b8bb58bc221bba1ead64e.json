Specifically, SARS-CoV-2 Lambda variant exhibit higher infectivity and immune resistance [4] and Delta variant possessing highly transmissible contains mutations that confer partial immune 4 escape [5] . To develop clinically available SARS-CoV-2 inhibitors, a number of repurposed chemical or biological drugs have been evaluated [6, 7] . Unfortunately, recent clinical trials organized by the World Health Organization indicated that several promising drugs including remdesivir, hydroxychloroquine, and lopinavir had little effect on hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [8] .

Meanwhile, it has been reported that certain peptides such as dalbavacin [23] and human intestinal defensin 5 [24] could directly bind to ACE2 with high affinity (K D 147 nM and 76.2 nM, respectively) to block its interaction with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein.

Thus, we tested the activities of A3 against 3CL pro , the other important target for SARS-CoV-2 infection [36] . A3 only showed an inhibition of 14.37% at 10 \u00b5M, indicating 3CL pro was not a target for A3. RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is also a critical target for SARS-CoV-2. The nonstructural proteins nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8 are essential components of RdRp. Nsp12 is the catalytic subunit, and nsp7 and nsp8 are cofactors [37] . While we failed to establish the RdRp assay, we determined the binding of A3 and GA with nsp12, nsp7, and nsp8, respectively. The SPR results showed that A3 could bind with nsp7 much more tightly than with the other two proteins, with K D values of 167 nM, 15.5 \uf06dM, and 67.5 \uf06dM for nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12, respectively ( Fig. 4A; Supplementary Fig. S8 ). In 14 contrast, GA only showed very weak binding affinities, with K D values of 384, 91.2, and 416 \u03bcM, respectively ( Fig. 4B; Supplementary Fig. S8 ). Molecular docking of A3 with nsp7 extracted from the nsp7-nsp8 complex crystal structure (PDB ID:7JIT) demonstrated seven hydrogen bonds, and the binding energy was -8.7 kcal/mol (Fig.   4C ). These data indicated that nsp7 may be the target for A3.",

Given the significant antiviral activities and appropriate pharmacokinetic behaviors, both A3 and GA could be promising drug candidates for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2. On the other hand, GA-gg is a clinical drug, and its effects against COVID-19 as a pro-drug of GA deserve to be further evaluated in both animal and clinical studies. Considering that GA, GA-g and A3 could all inhibit S-RBD, and the most abundant GA-gg in licorice could be metabolized into the S-RBD inhibitor GA, S-RBD could be a critical target for licorice against SARS-CoV-2. Since that S-RBD is responsible for the entry of the virus into the host cells, licorice may be effective for both treatment and prevention of COVID-19. Our pharmacokinetic data gave the highest plasma concentration of GA as 7.7 \u03bcM when 200 mg/kg licorice extract is administrated. Compared to the EC 50 (3.17 \u03bcM) of GA, it further supported the potential of licorice to prevent and treat COVID-19 after oral administration. Interestingly, although the S-RBD inhibitory effects of A3 and GA are similar (IC 50 8.3 vs 10.9 \u00b5M), their antiviral activities are remarkably different (EC 50 0.075 vs 3.17 \u00b5M). One possible explanation is that A3 targeted other proteins in SARS-CoV-2 besides S-RBD. Our results suggested that A3 could strongly bind to nsp7, an essential component of the popular SARS-CoV-2 target RdRp. This indicated that licorice inhibit SARS-CoV-2 infection by affecting both entry and replication of the virus. The results also demonstrated the \"multi-component, multi-target\" character of natural medicines.",
