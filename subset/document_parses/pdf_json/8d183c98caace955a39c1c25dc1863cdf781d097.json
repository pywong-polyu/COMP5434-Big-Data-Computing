In a retrospective analysis of a cohort of 131 patients with T2DM hospitalized for COVID-19 in Wuhan, we have previously found that metformin use prior to hospitalization is associated with reduced mortality. Here we continue to investigate the effects of inpatient use of T2DM medications, including metformin, acarbose, insulin, and sulfonylureas, on the mortality of COVID-19 patients with T2DM during hospitalization. We found that patients using metformin and acarbose, alone or both together, after admission were signi cantly more likely to survive than those who did not use either metformin or acarbose. Thus, our analyses suggest that inpatient use of metformin and acarbose together or alone during hospitalization should be studied in randomized trials.",

We and others have previously reported on the risks and bene ts of inpatient glycemic control 9, 10 ; however, the best strategy to apply to COVID-19 patients remains unclear. In theory insulin may be bene cial as it could achieve glucose control effectively and avoid hyperglycemia-related complications such as immunosuppression and oxidative stress. On the other hand, some oral agents such as metformin may activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), which has important effects on autophagy 11 . Acarbose is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, which serves to delay glucose absorption and thus reduce the post-prandial insulin spike 12 . Acarbose has been shown to have potentially important effects on the gut microbiome although the impact of these changes is unclear 13 . Acarbose is a commonly used diabetes medication in China for post-prandial glucose control due to the relatively high-carbohydrate diets.",

We found that there were no signi cant differences in the distribution of these confounding factors in different groups of patients as mentioned above, except for HbA1c (Table 3) . Patients taking metformin alone or with acarbose had signi cantly higher levels of HbA1c than those taking neither drugs (Table 3 ; also see refs). However, higher levels of HbA1c were adversely associated with survival, as we have previously shown 6 . Thus, the bene cial effects of taking both metformin with or without acarbose on survival were not attributable to the differences in HbA1c levels in these patients. In addition, signi cant differences were found in the distribution of patients taking or not taking sulfonylureas among these four groups of patients taking different combinations of metformin and acarbose (Table 3 ). In this case, the differences were due to more patients not taking any drugs (49), and an imbalance between patients taking sulfonylureas and acarbose (12) vs. those taking sulfonylureas and metformin (3), whereas the same number of sulfonylureas-taking patients (8 each) who also took both metformin and acarbose as those who took none of these two drugs (Table 3 ). Since patients taking sulfonylureas alone or with either acarbose or metformin were not signi cantly associated with better survival (Table 1 , 2), we interpret that additional use of sulfonylureas does not seem to be associated with survival bene ts to patients taking metformin or acarbose or both.",

This study has found that acarbose, used alone or together with metformin during treatment, is associated with reduced mortality of COVID-19 patients with T2DM. Acarbose is another inexpensive drug that is widely used at least in China. Since metformin or acarbose alone is bene cial, taking both might have additive or even synergistic effects.
