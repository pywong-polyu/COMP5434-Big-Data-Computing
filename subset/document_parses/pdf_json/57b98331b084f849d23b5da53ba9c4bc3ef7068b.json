However, the remaining problem of the current COVID-19 disease is that second wave of the epidemic is expected after imposed quarantine is discontinued in each country. It can be estimated that for most countries only 1% of the population of the infected country/region will acquire the immunity after first wave of epidemic controlled by the effective quarantine. That would require next 50-60 similarly controlled waves to achieve herd (population) immunity of 50-70 % in order to stop further spread of disease. Such scenario is improbable as it would require a significant amount of time, during which the individual immunity could be lost because even today, when more than 3 million people have been infected (28 April 2020), it is not clear whether the recovered patients have the immunity. However, hope for SARS-CoV-2 antiviral vaccine or sufficiently effective antiviral drugs, or SARS-CoV-2 virus mutation to less aggressive strain [1] gives us chance to survive through the course of the controlled epidemic. Therefore, forecasting the spread of the pandemic on basis of mathematical models are extremely important for decisions how to prepare countries in order to avoid overloading of health system and manage other related problems. Valuable information that could be obtained from modelling is forecast of the expected time and number of most active infected cases and the effectiveness of applied infection control measures. It is current global trend, that the experience and available data from already affected countries are used to model the pandemic dynamics in other countries before the epidemic has reached the peak or to estimate effectiveness of various scenario of the next wave management [2] .",

The dynamics of the simplest SIR system (excluding birth and death) can be described by the following set of ordinary differential equations [7] : ( 1 ) where \u03b3 is the rate of recovery or mortality, \u03b2 is the infectious rate controlling the rate of spread that represents the probability of transmitting disease from infectious individual to susceptible individual. The disease transition rate \u03b2/NI is defined as a product of \u03b2 and a probability of disease transmission during a contact between an infectious individual and a susceptible individual. In that case, is the average number of contacts per person per time unit and can be defined by the typical time between contacts . The transition rate between I and R defined by \u03b3 and is estimated from typical time until recovery . In case of isolation or self-isolation, \u03b3 can be defined by the average number of days that a person is infectious (before they are isolated or self-isolate), .",

In realistic scenario, the growth rate of new cases does not change sharply at time because of time lag due to incubation period, infections generated by non-registered infected individuals and so on. In addition, it takes time for people to adjust to the quarantine requirements after the beginning of the quarantine; therefore, there is a time lag before people start to strictly follow the rules. Consequently, the growth rate of new cases decreases from initial value until reaches value satisfying the effectiveness of applied quarantine at the time ( Figure 3 ). is the period during which number of new cases reaches maximum value after the quarantine start . During the stage of constant , the epidemic is suppressing until the end of the epidemic at the time , after which only small number new infection case are registered. Duration of decreasing stage depends on and properties of Covid-19 disease, such as incubation period and time span of individual being infectious. As a result, the angle of \u03c6 depends on quarantine effectiveness, because condition satisfies zero quarantine effectiveness , while case of approaching to corresponds to quarantine effectiveness approaching to 1.",

Situation in Russia serves as an example of ineffective quarantine conditions during first 2 weeks of the country lockdown. This can be explained by huge size of the country and heterogeneous distribution of the population across the country, which is reason for sequence of arising infection clusters in different place/locations/regions at different times, despite that national quarantine was imposed on 30 March, 2020.

We proposed the simplified approach, which allows to estimate effectiveness of the imposed quarantine conditions/restrictions, to forecast the epidemic spread and to take appropriate decisions. The observed dynamics of pandemic in various countries shows that the growth rate of new infection cases linearly decreases when the quarantine is imposed in a country (or a region) until it reaches constant value, which corresponds to the effectiveness of quarantine measures taken in the country. The proposed parameters and together with analysis of the population mobility and social contacts can be used to estimate effectiveness of country or region lockdown measures; and on the basis of these parameters, the countries experiencing ongoing epidemic can use the proposed approach to study effectiveness of taken measures in other countries yet affected by the Covid-19 disease.",
