Some of the most typical applications utilizing the analysis of binary images are Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and Optical Mark Recognition (OMR), which may also be applied for unevenly illuminated natural images, as well as for challenging degraded historical document images, considered as typical benchmarking tools for image binarization algorithms.",

This approach can be considered as the extension of recently developed image preprocessing method utilizing Generalized Gaussian Distribution (GGD), based on the assumption of its similarity to the histograms of ground truth binary images distorted by Gaussian noise. The processing time of the first step, producing the intermediate images with partially removed background information, may be significantly reduced due to the use of the Monte Carlo method.",

Bickley. Since the distortions in this dataset are related not only to overall noise caused by photocopying, but also discolorization and water stains, as well as differences in ink contrast for different years, it may be considered as even more challenging in comparison to DIBCO datasets [26] .

Good examples may be the applications of local features with the use of Gaussian Mixture Models [17] or the use of deep neural networks [32] , where multiple processing stages are necessary. Some comparisons of popular methods and their overviews can be found in recent survey papers or books [3, 31] . In many methods the additional background removal, median filtering or morphological processing are required, as well as time-consuming training process for recently popular deep convolutional neural networks. Therefore, our moti-vation is the increase of performance of some classical methods due to efficient image preprocessing rather than comparison with sophisticated state-of-the-art methods and solutions based on deep learning, considering also the time-quality efficiency challenges [14] .",

When p \u2192 \u221e, the GGD density function goes to a uniform distribution and for p \u2192 0, f (x) becomes an impulse function. A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) consists of Gaussian distribution components defined by their locations \u03bc and standard deviations \u03c3 and additionally, a vector of mixing proportions. Due to the main purpose of investigation, related to image binarization, the application of two Gaussian distribution components is considered, since only two classes of pixels are assumed. In the other words, it is assumed that only two clusters are present in the image, consisting of pixels representing text and background respectively, and -in the ideal case -each cluster is represented by a single Gaussian distribution component. Having computed the parameters of the GMM with two Gaussian distribution components, the initial threshold should be located between the locations \u03bc of both distributions and may be calculated in several ways e.g. as the intersection point of two determined curves. The GMM parameters can be determined using the iterative Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm. The algorithm iterates over two steps until the convergence is achieved. The first step would estimate the expected value for each observation and the maximization step would optimize the parameters of the probability distributions using the maximum likelihood.",

Some visible imperfections, such as faded and low contrast ink, as well as the presence of noisy distortions and some stains, influence the histogram of the image. Hence, assuming the analysis of greyscale images, more intermediate grey levels may be observed, similarly as for binary images corrupted by Gaussian noise, as illustrated in Fig. 1 for the sample image no. 7 from DIBCO2017 dataset. This similarity is especially well visible assuming the use of two Gaussian distributions modelling the histogram of the ground truth (GT) binary image corrupted by Gaussian noise. Therefore, the approximation of histograms by the GMM with two Gaussian distribution components should be useful for the initial thresholding step, eliminating the most of the background information. It can be conducted by choosing a threshold between two peaks of the approximated histogram defined by their location parameters \u03bc. Another possible approach, investigated in one of the previous papers [11] , is the use of a single Gaussian distribution or the GGD, being its extended version. Nevertheless, the choice of its location parameter \u03bc as the initial threshold leads to elimination of less background information. The comparison of parameters of the GGD and GMM with two Gaussian distribution components (further referred as GMM2), obtained for the sample image no. 7 from DIBCO2017 with a typical bimodal histogram, is shown in Fig. 2 , where the threshold selected for the GMM is marked as the intersection point of both Gaussian curves.",

Hence, only the results obtained for full images, considered as easier for potential recalculation, are presented in this paper, although the same results have been achieved applying the Monte Carlo method almost for all images. To avoid the presentation of all metrics based on the number of TP, TN, FP and FN pixels, we have focused on accuracy and PSNR, as well as some alternative metrics, such as DPD and MPM. The results of experiments conducted for all DIBCO datasets and Bickley Diary database are illustrated in Fig. 4 . Better results are represented by higher accuracy and PSNR, but lower DRD and MPM values.",
