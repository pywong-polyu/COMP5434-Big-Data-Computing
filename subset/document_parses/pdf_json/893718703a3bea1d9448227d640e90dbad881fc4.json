MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are closely related to ALI and acute respiratory distress syndrome. TargetScan software analysis showed that miR-584-5p can bind to the 3\u02b9 noncoding region of TLR4, which is involved in the occurrence and development of ALI, thereby affecting the inflammatory pathway and inflammation development. us, we aimed to determine whether miR-584-5p affects ALI. Human bronchial epithelial (16-HBE) cells were transfected with miR-584-5p mimics or inhibitors and then stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS). e cell viability, apoptosis, release of proinflammatory factors, mTOR, and NF-\u03baB pathway protein expression were evaluated respectively. Mimic584 increased, whereas inhibitor584 decreased, LPS-stimulated inflammation. e protein expression of inflammatory factors was significantly increased in 16-HBE cells in the mimic584 + LPS group and decreased in the inhibitor584 + LPS group. Mimic584 activated mTOR and the NF-\u03baB-related proteins P65 and p-p65, whereas inhibitor584 inactivated the proteins in 16-HBE cells. Overexpression of miR-584 significantly promoted apoptosis in LPS-stimulated 16-HBE cells. ere were no differences in the proliferation and cell cycle of LPS-stimulated 16-HBE cells regardless of mimic584 or inhibitor584 transfection. Collectively, we demonstrated that inhibitor584 can alleviate ALI-induced expression of inflammatory factors via mTOR signaling and the NF-\u03baB pathway. In conclusion, we found that inhibitor584 transfection could be a potential therapeutic strategy for ALI.",

A bioinformatic analysis indicated MIS12 as the target gene of miR-584-5p. In this study, the effect and mechanism of action of miR-584-5p on the inflammatory response of LPS-induced ALI were explored. In particular, a novel mechanism was investigated to identify potential targets for the treatment of ALI and biological indicators to determine the prognosis of ALI. For this purpose, human bronchial epithelial (16-HBE) cells were transfected with miR-584 mimics or inhibitors and then incubated with LPS. Next, we evaluated cell viability, apoptosis, proinflammatory factor release, mTOR expression, and the expression of proteins in the NF-\u03baB pathway to elucidate the role of miR-584-5p in LPS-stimulated 16-HBE cells. e cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Vivacell, Shanghai, China) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in a humidified 37\u00b0C incubator with 5% CO 2 [13] . e cells (approximately 4 \u00d7 10 5 /well) were plated in six-well plates and incubated for 24 h [14] .",

Studies [27, 28] have also revealed that viral infections, such as H5N1 infection, can cause lung epithelial cell autophagy and NF-\u03baB activation. Preventing autophagy can not only inhibit epithelial cell death but also improve H5N1-induced ALI. Here, we found that the activation of mTOR and the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway increased the expression of inflammatory factors [29] IL-1, IL-6, IL-8, TNF-\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-1\u03b1. us, inhibitor584 may exert its therapeutic potential, that is, decreasing inflammatory factor expression, through the inactivation of mTOR and the NF-\u03baB pathway.",
