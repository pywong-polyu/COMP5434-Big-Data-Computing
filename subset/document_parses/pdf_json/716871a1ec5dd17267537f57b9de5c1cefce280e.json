What is opportune this time is the call for clarity around what nurses do and what society can expect from them. Nurses, as members of a global profession, need a platform to build a contemporary practice life. This paper proposes the model: The Exemplary Practice Life of the Nurse. It provides a framework to explicate the essence of the role of the nurse. The model posits four inter-related essential components or pillars that ground a nurse's behavior and commitment: professionalism, leadership, scholarly practice, and stewardship. This uncomplicated, straightforward model is universally applicable for nurses to apply in whatever roles they hold and at any point in their careers. The use of a holistic model, as a guide across a full career trajectory, supports the nurse's ability to prioritize individual pillars while understanding the interrelationship and influence among the four pillars. The authors pose assumptions that form the basis of the registered nurse role and provide the foundation for the exemplary practice life of the nurse. They make recommendations to nurses, the profession, the workplace, the academy, and the community.",

As a result, nurses face extraordinary challenges to meet the emerging health care needs in a society that has experienced a long response to a global pandemic and faces significant health disparities.

But the practice of nursing remains unevena reflection of wide variations in educational preparation, clinical expertise, and professional growth among its millions of individual clinicians. Nurses themselves often have difficulty articulating the essence of their practice. It is therefore not surprising that the public it serves has yet to fully grasp a consistent understanding of nursing's unique contributions to society much beyond nurses' uniform person-centered caring, comforting presence, reliable judgment, and technical expertise.",

We are proposing a universally applicable, compelling, straightforward conceptual model to explicate what nurses do. This model can guide nurses in their work, in whatever setting and in whatever the current stage of their careers. We believe that a universal holistic model is needed given the complexities of a global economy, the disparities embedded in the health care needs of society, the demand for expanded knowledge development, technological innovation, the pace of change in health care systems, and the public need to understand the work of nurses.",

We define exemplary nursing practice as the best of the best of the art and science of nursing, and it represents the highest level of knowledge, expertise, and competence.

To explain its meaning, one needs to begin with the fact that no one is born a professional. Rather, it is an intentional process of development that begins in formative education, transitions into the workplace, and continues through the major stages of a nurse's career. \"Developing and nurturing professionalism in nursing takes time, authentic presence of leaders, engagement of colleagues and somehow creating a feel of value in the contribution of each nurse, from the bedside to the boardroom\" (p. 266, Leclerc, 2017) .

Since 1922, Sigma Theta Tau, the International Nursing Honor Society has recognized and promoted nursing scholarship as one of its major tenets (Sigma Theta Tau, 2020). Carper's (1978) seminal work formulated what she coined \"nurses' patterns of knowing\" which set the foundation for scholarly practice. Benner's model From Novice to Expert further advanced this discussion as an explanation of how knowledge and skills are acquired and applied to nursing practice (Benner, 1982 (Benner, , 1984 . While the dialogue on how to define scholarly practice continues to evolve, the message of its importance to the profession and to quality patient care outcomes remains consistently strong. Riley et al. (2002) , described a universal holistic model of scholarly nursing practice consisting of the scholarship of knowing teaching, practice, and service. This model evolved later to include the role attributes of \"who I am\" and \"what I do\" (Riley et al., 2008) . Participants (N = 36) in this qualitative study shared that they think of themselves as: 1) available for others, 2) active learners, 3) out of the box thinkers, 4) passionate about nursing, and 5) confident. They carry these values while leading, caring, sharing knowledge, and being self-reflective. We believe that scholarly practice includes the characteristics of developing new knowledge, improving practice, basing practice decisions on evidence, designing, and implementing innovative practices, using creative approaches to individualize the needs of the people we serve, and advancing system-wide priorities and initiatives.",

Informal leadership roles are exercised by those individuals who are situationally willing to step up and take actions; they are the \"go-to nurses\" (Clifton, 2014, p. 68) . Within the culture of workplace organizations, an informal leader has been described as anyone who directs/guides a group toward accomplishing desired outcomes (Ross, 2014) . Nurses, who engage in scholarly practice throughout the healthcare enterprise, assume informal leadership roles in acknowledged and unacknowledged ways. Riley et al. (2008) in their study that explored perspectives of thirtysix experienced nurses' descriptions of their scholarly nursing practice, found that participants' perspectives of leadership differed from more traditional views of formal leadership. Participants spoke to a nonhierarchical approach to leadership that they repeatedly called \"stepping up the plate over and over again to guarantee the highest level of care\u2026to develop others and to advance practice\" (pg. 431). Informal leadership was their expectation for their exemplary practice life. We believe that informal leadership needs to not only be further developed and supported but included in the performance expectations for every nurse in every workplace.",

It is consequential for formative education at the baccalaureate and master's entry level education.

We ask them to consider the integration of the model in systematic performance evaluation matrices that foster an exemplary practice environment. \u2022 For the academy, we ask that leaders commit to conducting a systematic curricular appraisal to ensure that the model components are equally integrated throughout educational formation. Formative clinical learning needs to shift from a predominately skill acquisition model to a model that recognizes a more equitable distribution of the four essential pillars as the foundation for developing an exemplary nurse. Accomplishing the integration of this model into the curriculum is the first step in preparing the nurse of the future. \u2022 We ask the leaders of professional associations to use their collective voice to advocate for the privilege of all nurses to have an exemplary practice life. The right of all members of society to have their health and wellness needs met equally requires no less than all nurses having an exemplary practice life. Furthermore, we ask that professional associations work collaboratively with certification, accreditation, legislative and regulatory bodies to commit to advancing the BSN as the preferred professional nursing degree. While efforts have been made in the past, there is a greater sense of urgency as the complexity of care continues to increase. \u2022 For communities, we recognize their position as a guardian and supporter of society's health and wellness needs.
