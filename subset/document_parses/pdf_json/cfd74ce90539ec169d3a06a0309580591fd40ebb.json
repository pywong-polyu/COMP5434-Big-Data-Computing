We contribute to these debates by proposing a new multidimensional, intertemporal measure of economic insecurity that accounts for both its multiplicity and its dynamism. First, we develop three theory-driven, multidimensional measures of economic insecurity. Principal Components Analysis validates the measure. Second, we develop a dynamic approach to insecurity, using longitudinal data and a newly revised headcount method. Third, we then use our new measures to analyze the distribution of insecurity in Europe. Our analysis shows that insecurity is widespread across Europe, even in low-inequality, encompassing welfare states. Moreover, it extends across income groups and occupational classes, reaching into the middle classes.",

            "text": "In the postwar period, economic growth, welfare states, and social dialogue supported the expansion of economic security across social classes in many European societies. But since the 1990s, the deregulation of labour markets and the emergence of new social risks have been eroding the social foundations of such stability, potentially spreading economic insecurity into to the middle classes. The recession of 2008-2013 and the ongoing COVID-19 crisis may be reinforcing these trends, further spreading economic insecurity higher up the class ranks.",

            "text": "Spreading economic insecurity is surprising for Europe, where the debate tended to focus on poverty trends and social exclusion (F\u00f6rster & Vleminckx, 2004; Cantillon and Vanderbroucke, 2014; Mood, 2015) rather than the \"middle-class squeeze\" as in the United States (Frank, 2013; Hacker, 2008; Pressman, 2007; Scott & Pressman, 2011) . For instance, scholarship on the 2008-13 recession stresses its impact on poverty risks and hardship (Atkinson et al., 2017; Matsaganis & Leventi, 2014) , with scarce attention paid to the consequences for the middle class. Such different emphasis may reflect the assumption that the redistributive capacity of European welfare states insulates middles classes from financial precarity (Dallinger, 2013) . Thus, in Europe there is still relatively little comparative research on economic insecurity specifically (Fouarge & Layte, 2005; Jenkins et al., 2012; Kenworthy, 2013; Rohde et al, 2014; Whelan, Russell, et al., 2015; Whelan et al., 2017; Cant\u00f3 et al., 2020) .",

Building on the pioneering work of Gornick and Jaentti (2013) , Whelan, Russell, et al. (2015) and D'Ambrosio (2018), we develop a new measure to capture the substance of economic insecurity while distinguishing it from traditional measures of permanent poverty and material deprivation. Following Osberg (1998) and Hacker et al. (2014) , we focus on the objective aspects of insecurity. A principal-components analysis (PCA) supports the measure. Second, we conduct an inter-temporal analysis (Alkire et al., 2014) to capture the dynamic and transitory character of economic insecurity. We elaborate a revision of the AF (Alkire and Foster) headcount approach identifying \"insecurity spells\". Third, we use longitudinal data from the EU Statistics of Income and Living Conditions (EU-SILC) to describe the distribution of medium-term (2-4 year) economic insecurity in the period 2007-2012. We find that in a crisis period insecurity spells varied in frequency and duration across countries in Europe, but were present across welfare regimes and varieties of capitalism. We then show that insecurity extends well up the class and income ranks.",

While deprivation consists of a current shortage of essential resources for survival of families, economic insecurity rather reflects the over-time instability of economic situations.

Income volatility has thus been mainly analyzed in terms of poverty risk. Through long-term sequence analysis, the traditional approach to poverty has tended to focus on households living in permanent poverty (Vandecasteele, 2010 (Vandecasteele, , 2011 . A \"Beveridgean perspective\", whereby problematic situations are identified by reference to a collectively fixed threshold such as the poverty line, has been privileged, distinguishing these approaches from analysis of income drops. Moving to a dynamic assessment of poverty, a newer approach has tried to capture the increasing number of households facing temporary poverty situations, characterized by ups and downs around the poverty line (Whelan et al., 2003) . Already the classic research of Bane and Ellwood (1986) showed that income volatility was very high in the US, and that individuals in permanent poverty were a very small minority of the total population. More recently, Sandoval et al. (2009) consider the number of spells below the poverty level, and find that in the US poverty is becoming more transitory, but its risk is becoming more widespread. A strong association between poverty risk and paid labor (Cantillon and Vandenbrouke, 2014) corroborates the idea that temporary poverty has increased as consequence of higher unemployment, the spread of temporary work and precarious employment in many European countries.",

While household indebtedness was mainly driven by deregulation of the financial sector and proliferation of new financial instruments through 2007, since the onset of the financial crisis indebtedness has been increasingly associated with a worsening in the financial conditions of households (Fligstein & Goldstein, 2015) . In recent years, scholars turned toward the role of debt in household financial insecurity (Anderloni & Vandone, 2011) . Theoretical debate focuses on the neo-classical economic definition of debt as a tool for adjusting spending to expectations of future income; here, indebtedness increases economic welfare by smoothing consumption over time. However, the recent explosive growth of household debt, and especially unsecured debt (i.e. consumer credit), seems less related to consumption smoothing than to prevailing financial difficulties of overly indebted households (Jappelli et al., 2013) .",

More specifically, it defines a unit (individual or household) as poor if it experiences scarcity of basic resources and if such scarcity is repeatedly experienced over time (number of spells).

All such parameters are the result of choices made by the researcher. While Alkire and Foster (2011) claim, following Sen (Anand & Sen, 1997) , that the choice of parameters (cutoffs and weights) is always a value judgement, and that their approach allows flexibility and adaptation to different institutional or operational circumstances, it has been shown, on the other hand, that normative choices of cut-offs can impact the outcomes (see for example Aaberge & Brandolini, 2014) . As it has been also pointed out (Wagle, 2014) , in the case of multidimensional indexes, such arbitrariness multiplies. Therefore, we argue that the accumulation of decisions related to three cut-offs would undermine the final results.

Therefore, we only defined a cut-off for each dimension, while we did not define a second multi-dimensional cut-off to create a unified insecurity measure. For the same reason, we did not set a pre-determined duration cut-off. This allows showing how different one-dimensional transitory and chronic situations are distributed.

Below we describe the PCA solution, which is shown in Table 1 . Financial strain is our label for the first factor, which loads most heavily on items that ask respondents about their household's inability to (1) afford one week holiday once a year, (2) afford a meal with meat, chicken, fish (or vegetarian equivalent) \u2026. every second day, (3) keep home adequately warm, (4) face unexpected financial expenses, (5) make ends meet, and (6) [bear the] financial burden of the housing costs. Through their strong association, these items show situations of high economic pressure and consumption compression, which endanger the capacity of households to cope with financial demands and satisfy their own needs, which vary according to the socio-economic contexts where they live. While income-based measures show the households' deficit in resources flows or stocks, our index of financial strain looks at consumption/expenditure, and shows the stresses faced by many households in keeping an adequate living standard.",

While the over-indebted household has been conceptually defined as \"one whose existing and foreseeable resources are insufficient to meet its financial commitments without lowering its living standards\" (Fondeville et al., 2010, p. 4 ), more practical measures have been adopted in empirical research. According to previous research, subjective or objective indicators considered separately show strong limitations due to different individual judgment of what \"difficulty\" means, and huge variability in national legal regulations governing late payment.

To create an index measuring continuity, as explained in Sect. 3.3, we followed Bossert et al. (2012) and weighted our headcounts twice every time the household was below one of the cut off points consecutively rather than in separated spells. Each insecurity indexes varied therefore between 0 and 7. We see from Table 2 that \"financial strain\" and \"temporary poverty\" are the most diffuse aspects, with similar average duration and continuity. \"Over-indebtedness\" is obviously less diffused as this index captures only households that are explicitly unable to pay their financial commitments. Building on these results, we develop the next analysis in three steps. First, we analyze the time dynamic of our indexes and we look at the intersections among them. This allows us to build up a new typology of economic insecurity, which is composed of several categories. Second, we observe the cross-country differentiation of this typology to investigate whether and to what extent differentiated social and welfare regime contexts may affect economic insecurity. Third, we consider how households affected by different aspects of economic insecurity are distributed across diverse class groups. Figure 2 gives a sensitive representation of the relevance and characteristics of temporary insecure conditions as opposed to more chronic situations. While the Y-axis shows the share of households affected by one to three insecurity dimensions (this number only indicates the number of insecurity dimensions, whatever they are), the X-axis reports the time continuity of insecurity, ranging from 1 (only one spell) to 7 (continuous insecurity for the whole surveyed time). Households experiencing at least one spell of insecurity (whatever dimension is considered) are concentrated in two big groups: those only with one spell mostly involving one single dimension of insecurity (concentrated on the left side), and those facing many spells and mainly two or three multiple insecure conditions at the same time (shown on the right side). While chronicity very often involves a progressive accumulation of insecure conditions, many households experience only a very temporary (mostly only 1 year) critical situation affecting only one dimension. From these results, we elaborate a typology, shown in Table 3 where different situations are dynamically described.",

These cross-national differences, detailed in Table 4 , are summarized as area plots in Fig. 3 . The higher concentration of transitory economic insecurity in Continental countries may reflect a marked dualization in the labor market, the spread of unstable employment positions in this area as consequence of the economic recession, and higher exposure of households to risks related to financialization. On the other hand, the geographical distribution of long-term multiple insecurity was much more differentiated, with higher concentration in CEE and Mediterranean countries. In the figure, we observe a clear U shaped distribution in CEE and Mediterranean countries, to show that both long-term and short-term insecurity predominate. Nordic countries were characterized by a L-shaped curve, where only transitory problems predominate. France and the UK were in a mixed position. Figure 4 shows the distribution of economic insecurity across income deciles. 7 While longterm multiple economic insecurity and temporary poverty were unsurprisingly concentrated in the lowest three deciles, our indexes of transitory financial strain and over-indebtedness were more broadly distributed across income deciles. Thus, in the crisis, economic insecurity mainly related to consumption difficulties and indebtedness in middle-income groups, while the poorest households experienced transitory or permanent poverty. 8 While poverty was concentrated in the poorest deciles, the lower-middle income groups (between the third and fifth decile of the income distribution) were more likely to face difficulties in their financial sustainability than low-income groups. For these groups, it was not the scarcity of income in itself, but rather expense or debt levels, that caused insecurity. The analysis above has limited utility for sociological class analysis, since it is based on income rather than social classes. To address this limitation, we also used a simplified version of the European Socio-economic Classification (ESeC) 9 to analyze the distribution of different types of insecurity. Figure 5 shows that households affected by long term multiple economic insecurity were more concentrated not only in the working class (categories 1-2) but also in the lower middle class (category 3). Such risk was hardly experienced by households in the middle-upper and upper social classes. Other types of economic insecurity, however, did not line up so neatly with social class. For example, temporary poverty was significant among the lower middle class in 2007-2013, owing to the economic recession. 10 The financial strain type cut most strongly across classes, and only drops significantly for the highest class. The intermediate class, which combines technicians and public employees with medium to high qualification, experienced substantial financial strain and over-indebtedness.",

Economic insecurity is considered here as a specific combination of multiple difficulties that are dynamically and reciprocally intertwined. Moreover, our measure integrates three dimensions of economic insecurity that are often treated separately: financial strain, over-indebtedness, and temporary poverty.",

This allows us not only to reduce the number of arbitrary decisions, but also to decompose the different dimensions and dynamics of economic insecurity. One of the main results is that we isolated short term insecurity from chronic, and potentially more dangerous, financial difficulty.",

Finally, we show that economic insecurity is broadly distributed across European households, reaching surprisingly high up the income and class ranks.",

We emphasize that this insecurity concerns not only the absolute amount of available resources, but also the stability of resource flows and the relation of income to consumption. Economic insecurity does not just increase the risk of poverty or material deprivation. Rather, it is a diffuse condition many households experience. Thus, economic insecurity not only causes problems for individual households, but may constitute a broader social problem in and of itself.",

Although this paper describes the distribution of economic insecurity across European nations and households in crisis time, we have left the explanation of these patters to future work. Notably, we lack data on psychological orientations toward the future. Additionally, we need new research on the relationship between trigger events and specific insecurity situations. And, structural conditions potentially responsible for the distribution of economic insecurity need to be properly assessed. Finally, we need to analyse the consequences of insecurity, in terms of social behaviour, investments in the future, and political orientation. Short-term insecurity may have different impacts on people depending on the role played by public and private buffers. In this sense, we call for new research to understand what role may be played by broad welfare regimes and specific social policies in protecting people from insecurity and its potential consequences.",
