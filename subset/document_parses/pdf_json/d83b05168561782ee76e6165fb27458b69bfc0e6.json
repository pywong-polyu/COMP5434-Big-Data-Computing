            "text": "Over two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the human immune response to SARS-CoV-2 during the active disease phase has been extensively studied. However, the long-term impact after recovery, which is critical to advance our understanding SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19-associated long-term complications, remains largely unknown. Herein, we characterized multi-omic singlecell profiles of circulating immune cells in the peripheral blood of 100 patients, including covenlesent COVID-19 and sero-negative controls. The reduced frequencies of both short-lived monocytes and long-lived regulatory T (Treg) cells are significantly associated with the patients recovered from severe COVID-19. Consistently, sc-RNA seq analysis reveals seven heterogeneous clusters of monocytes (M0-M6) and ten Treg clusters (T0-T9) featuring distinct molecular signatures and associated with COVID-19 severity. Asymptomatic patients contain the most abundant clusters of monocyte and Treg expressing high CD74 or IFN-responsive genes. In contrast, the patients recovered from a severe disease have shown two dominant inflammatory monocyte clusters with S100 family genes: S100A8 & A9 with high HLA-I whereas S100A4 & A6 with high HLA-II genes, a specific non-classical monocyte cluster with distinct IFITM family genes, and a unique TGF-b high Treg Cluster. The outpatients and seronegative controls share most of the monocyte and Treg clusters patterns with high expression of HLA genes. Surprisingly, while presumably short-ived monocytes appear to have sustained alterations over 4 months, the decreased frequencies of long-lived Tregs (high HLA-DRA and S100A6) in the outpatients restore over the tested convalescent time (>= 4 months). Collectively, our study identifies sustained and dynamically altered monocytes and Treg clusters with distinct molecular signatures after recovery, associated with COVID-19 severity.",

A common feature of SARS-CoV-2 infection in severe COVID-19 patients is lymphopenia with a drastic reduction in both T and B lymphocytes in the circulating blood. This lymphopenic response is often negatively associated with the viral load of SARS-CoV-2 as well as the disease severity (21, 27) . In addition, Wilk et al (21) performed some of the earliest singlecell RNA sequencing of COVID-19 patient-derived cells, identifying changes in the myeloid compartment as a consequence of more severe disease states. Despite these progresses, critical questions regarding to whether the dysregulated immune cell phenotypes observed during SARS-CoV-2 infection persist in COVID-19 patients after their full recovery, and if yes, how long the fingerprints in gene expression can be maintained, remain to be answered. In order to understand the post-COVID immune response, we utilized the single cell RNA sequencing approach and determined the molecular signatures of monocytes and understudied regulatory T (Treg) cells in the circulating blood from convalescent COVID-19 patients (when they were unvaccinated). Our studies revealed several unique clusters and molecular signatures in both populations sustained during the recovery phase after SARS-CoV-2 infection.",

Thus, in convalescent patients, the circulating monocytes and granulocytes are predominantly COVID-19 na\u00efve. To assess whether and how SARS-CoV-2 infection maintains a sustained impact to immune function, we characterized the levels of circulating monocytes from convalescent COVID-19 patients. We enrolled 100 convalescent patients at least three weeks after recovery from COVID-19 and analyzed both plasma IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain (RBD) and cellular immunity profiling (Table 1, Figure 1A ). Patients were classified into 5 groups based on severity of disease and RBD-IgG levels (Supplementary Figure 1B) (28, 29) , including sero-negative healthy control group (undetectable RBD-IgG and PCR negative/no PCR), asymptomatic (detectable RBD-IgG but symptom free during SARS-CoV-2 infection), outpatient (mild symptoms, detectable RBD-IgG), and hospitalized groups (non-ICU and ICU subgroups).",

Clustering analysis identified seven distinct clusters, each of which is specified with two top enriched genes, including five CD14 + classical monocyte clusters and one distinct CD16 + non-classical monocyte cluster M5_ISG15_IFI6, and one dendritic cell cluster M6_ZEB2_CCNL1 showing lower expression of both HLA and S100 family genes (Figure 2A-B) . Further evaluation of the five classical monocyte subsets found five subsets with inflammatory features. Clusters M1_S100A8_S100A9 and cluster M3_S100A6_S100A4 both showed high but distinct S100 genes (cluster 1 with high levels of S100A8 & 9, but cluster 3 with high S100A6 & 4). Also, the Importantly, these monocyte clusters with distinct molecular signatures were found to be associated with COVID-19 severity. The S100 family gene-high cluster M1-S100A8_S100A9 decreased but the immune regulatory receptor CD74-high cluster M2-CD74_HLA-DR increased in the convalescent patients with asymptomatic COVID-19 vs other patient groups. In addition, the cluster M5_ISG15_IFI6 with high in IFN signature genes were enriched in asymptomatic, but not other COVID-19 patients with severe disease (Figure 3A ). Of note, in outpatients the M5_ISG15_IFI6 cluster with IFN response genes was lost during the early (0-1 month) but restored later (2 months or after) disease onset ( Figure recovery ( Figure 3D ). The IFITM proteins have been identified as cell-autonomous proteins that suppress the early stages of viral replication(32), our data suggest that the increase of this nonclassical cluster might be responsible for the severe COVID-19 pathogenesis. Circulating, classical monocytes are known to have a short lifespan of no more than a few days, while non-classical monocytes display longer survival, but still are unlikely to live for more than 1 or 2 weeks (33).",

Consistent with their dynamic frequency changes, we discovered several COVID-19-associated immune signatures such as the elevated IFN responsive genes in asymptomatic COVID-19 patients, which appears to be downregulated in patients with severe disease in particular the ICU patients. Many studies through single cell transcriptome analysis of PBMCs obtained during the active phase of the disease, have shown that the impairments in the IFN response is the key mediators of severe disease (13, 31) . Our study here confirms that this dynamic association of IFN response with COVID-19 disease severity is sustained after full recovery. Interestingly, further longitudinal analysis showed that the elevated IFN responsive genes in monocytes could be sustained for more than 4 months of the studied time. In addition to IFN response, the altered HLA expression on myeloid cells during active SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is presumably due to the virus-induced inflammatory cytokines, have been identified (21, 37) . Our study here demonstrated that this HLA high signature is also sustained after COVID-19 recovery. During the convalescent phase following COVID-19 infection, the immune system consists of two distinct pools of cells, COVID-19 experienced, such as memory T and B cells specific to SARS-CoV-2 antigens, and COVID-19 unexperienced cells. It has been well documented that the half-life of classical and non-classical monocytes in both mice and human is estimated at half-to 2.2 days (38) (39) (40) . Therefore, in convalescent patients, the circulating monocytes and granulocytes are presumably unexperienced directly to SARS-CoV-2-specific antigens as well as the associated inflammatory environment during the acute phase of infection.",

As expected, our in-depth single cell transcriptome analysis of the sorted Treg populations identified 10 distinct clusters, confirming that human circulating Treg populations are highly heterogenous regardless with or without microbial infection (44) (45) (46) (47) (48) . Interestingly, a Treg population (cluster T4_KLF2_TGFB1) that was characterized by elevated expression of TGF-b and KLF2, was only identified in some COVID-19 patients in particular the ICU patients, but not in sero-negative healthy controls. Further longitudinal analysis shows that the upregulation of both TGF-b and KLF2 sustained only during the first three months after full recovery, which was not observed in these convalescent COVID-19 patients 4 months after their full recovery. The clinical significance of this TGF-b and KLF2 high population is unclear. Since Treg-specific production of TGF-b is critical for a variety of immunologic roles, the fact that this population is only observed in patients recovering from COVID-19 suggests a possible role in COVID-19 pathogenesis and recovery.",

Cluster M0_HLA-B_EEF2 and cluster M2_CD74_HLA-DR shared relatively similar gene expression patterns but Cluster M0 displayed enhanced S100A8/9, STAT1, and ZEB2 genes within multiple high level heatmap blocks genes and appear to be intermediate populations (Figure 2C & D). Consistant with previous studies showing the altered IFN response during the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection is responsible for severe disease (13, 31), we detected two clusters with high but distict IFN responsive genes: the classical monocyte cluster M5_ISG15_IFI6 displayed a unique gene expression pattern characterized by high expression of interferon stimulated genes including ISG15, IFI6, IFIT3, and IFIT2. In contrast, the cluster M4_IFITM_FCGR3A, which belong to CD16 + CD14non-classical monocytes, expressed high levels of different IFN responsive genes in particular the Interferon Induced Transmembrane Protein (IFITM) family genes ( IFITM1-3) (Figure 2C & D).",

IFN response gene IFI6 was highly enriched in the monocytes isolated from asymptomatic patients and the patients during 2-3 months after infection, whereas ISG15 was mostly depleted in the monocytes of ICU patients (Figure 3C-D, Supplementary Table S2). It has been well established that the impairments in the IFN response is the key critical for anti-SARS-CoV-2 immune response(13,31), our data imply a possibility that the patients with a better expansion of monocytes in M5_ISG15_IFI6, as well as Clusters M2_CD74_HLA-DR, have a favorable clinical outcome.Consistent with this notion, further analysis reavealed a trend in IFN-responsive monocyte reduction during the early recovery phase of outpatients, which gradually returned 4 months after acute infection (Figure 3D).Along with changes in the classical monocyte populations, the non-classical cluster M4_IFITM_FCGR3A appeared to be enriched specifically in recovered hospitalized patients (Figure 3A). Importantly, when examined in outpatients this enrichment was time dependent as the proportion of non-classical monocytes was enriched during the early recovery phase (0-1 month) since acute infection, which gradually returned to a comparable level as that in seronegative controls (Figure 3B). Interestingly, unlike the classical monocyte cluster M5_ISG15_IFI6, the non-classical monocytes in Cluster M4_IFITM_FCGR3A/CD16 have an dynamic changes in expression of distinct interferon-induced genes IFITM1-3, which are specifically enriched in the hospitalized non-ICU group. In contast, their levels, in particular IFITM3, in outpatients were significantly reduced (Figures 2D, 3A & 3C).

Clustering analysis identified 10 clusters (Figure 4A), indicating that Tregs in the circulating blood from both COVID-19 patients and healthy donors are highly heterogeneous. Further annotation of gene expression of the individual clusters identified related signatures between clusters, and each cluster is defined by one or two top enriched genes. Treg clusters T1_HLA-A_HLA-B and T5_HLA-DRA_S100A6 displayed high expression of FOXP3 and STAT1, which are consistent with an activated/effector Treg phenotype. To support this designation, clusters T1 and T5 also express high levels of HLA class II molecules and TIGIT (Figure 4B-D), which is thought to define a unique Treg subset that preferentially suppresses Th1 and Th17-driven inflammatory responses(34). Tregs in T1_HLA-A_HLA-B and T5_HLA-DRA_S100A6 also show a tissue migratory Treg-signature with high expresses levels of CCR10, CCR7, and FOXP1. In contrast, Tregs in clusters T2_ANXA1 and T3_EEF1_IFITM1, have reduced expression of TIGIT and class two HLA molecules. In addition, the cluster T6_TCF7_GAS5 shows lower levels of FOXP3 and CD25, as well as HLA family genes, but displays higher levels of central/homeostatic Treg markers including TCF7, SELL and IL-7R. Cluster T7_KLRB1_LMS1 also showed increased expression of CCR7, TCF7 and KLF2 consistent with a less suppressive Treg phenotype. Interestingly, a Treg population (cluster T4_KLF2_TGFB1) with elevated expression of TGF-b and KLF2 was only identified in a subset of covelesent COVID-19 patients, which was not identified in sero-negative patients (Figure 4B & 4C). The clinical significance of this cluster T4_KLF2_TGFB1 population is unclear. However, as Treg-specific production of TGF-b is known to have a variety of immunologic roles, the fact that this population is only observed in patients recovering from COVID-19 suggests a possible role in COVID-19 pathogenesis and recovery. Importantly, because this cluster was only identified in patients who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection, these cells may identify a distinct SARS-CoV-2-associated immunological profile. In addition to these 7 clusters with unique gene expression signatures, Tregs in cluster 0, T0_HLA-DR_CD74, share a largely common gene expression profile with all the rest clusters, implying a possibility that Tregs in this cluter are a intermediate population. Tregs in cluster 9, T9_DOCK8_LNPEP, which are rather minor, show reduced expression of genes enriched in cluster T3_EEF1_IFITM1 including EEF family and IFN responsive genes (Figure 4D). Similar to monocytes in convalescent COVID-19 patients, the relative proportions of the identified Treg clusters show differences that are correlated with both initial disease severity and the time post recovery. Comparing to sero-negative control and convalescent COVID-19 patients with milder disease, the hospitalized patients had a dramatic reduction in the population of effector/activated Tregs (clusters T1_HLA-A_HLA-B and T5_HLA-DRA_S100A6), which are known important for protecting patients from tissue injury during respiratory virus infections including SARS-CoV-2(35). In contrast, the hospitalized patients had a relative expansion in TGFb high cluster T4_KLF2_TGFB1 Tregs",

(A) Dimensional UMAP plot of Tregs from convalescent COVID-19 patients and sero-negative controls. (B) Expression of FOXP3 and CD25/IL2RA on the UMAP projection from A. (C) Expression of selected genes across clusters. FOXP3 and STAT1 are strongly expressed in clusters T1, T5 and T7, indicating effector cells. Clusters T2, T3, T6 and T9 show lower levels of FOXP3 and STAT1 but higher levels of SELL and IL7R, indicating central/homeostatic Treg cells. Cluster T5 expresses high levels of CCR10, CCR7 and FOXP3, potentially indicating a tissuemigratory effector Treg phenotype. Cluster T4 is unique to patients recovering from COVID-19 and expresses high levels of TGFB1 and KLF2. (D) Heatmap showing the expression levels of selected genes across all cells. Significance of gene expression difference in individual clusters evaluated by Wilcoxon comparison of cluster-cell expression levels with all-cell expression levels.

KLF2 and TGFB1 appear particularly high in the most severe patients. (C) Expression of cluster T4 characteristic genes across time in outpatients and sero-negative controls. TGFB and KLF2 are most highly expressed 0-3 months post disease.
