It is crucial for providers to understand whether pediatric patients are at risk for violent mechanisms, such as rape, assault, or other abuse. Therefore, we sought to perform a large database analysis of pediatric and adolescent female genitalia trauma, comparing mechanisms of injury (i.e., sexual abuse) and need for operative intervention between adolescent and pediatric cohorts. Methods The National Trauma Data Bank was queried (years 2007-2015) for female patients \u2264 16 years old with external genitalia (vaginal or vulvar) trauma. Two groups were compared: pediatrics (< 12 years old) and adolescents (12-16 years old). Results Out of 303,992 female patients, 3206 (1.1%) were identified to have genitalia trauma with the majority being pediatric patients (92.1%) and with injury to the vagina (62.6%). Pediatric patients with vaginal injury were less likely to be victims of rape (4.1% vs. 17.3%, p < 0.001) and assault (2.1% vs. 7.2%, p < 0.001) but more likely to be victims of other abuse (9.5% vs. 3.4%, p = 0.003). More of the adolescent patients with vaginal trauma required repair (58.7% vs. 43.2%, p < 0.001). Pediatric patients with injury to the vulva were less likely to be victims of rape (0.7% vs. 2.8%, p = 0.01) and motor vehicle accidents (4.2% vs. 11.0%, p < 0.001). Conclusion Genitalia trauma occurs in 1.1% of pediatric and adolescent trauma cases with the vagina being more commonly injured compared to the vulva. Adolescent patients with vaginal injuries were more likely to be victims of rape and assault and required repair more often, while those with vulvar injuries were more likely due to motor vehicle accidents. Health care providers must be aware of these at-risk populations and the differences between them to identify female victims of violence and provide resources to assist with recovery.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Publisher's Note Springer Nature remains neutral with regard to jurisdictional claims in published maps and institutional affiliations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Trauma is one of the leading causes of pediatric mortality in the United States (US) with an additional 9.2 million children presenting annually to US emergency departments for non-fatal injuries [1] .

We add to this literature by further dividing injuries based on anatomy (vaginal vs. vulvar) and age group (pediatrics vs. adolescent patients), demonstrating that common mechanisms of injury change based on vaginal or vulvar injury and pediatric or adolescent population. Our study was consistent in that we found a greater rate of vaginal injuries was caused by rape or assault, with ~ 17% of vaginal injuries in adolescent patients due to rape.

Moreover, data regarding the exact operative intervention and the type of provider performing these interventions were also unavailable. In addition, as mentioned, the NTDB only includes patients seen at a verified trauma center by the trauma team. Thus, patients with relatively minor traumatic injuries seen solely by an emergency room physician were not accounted for in this study, thereby likely overestimating the number of injuries that require repair. Additionally, given that the trauma team sees a limited portion of this population, these patients are likely biased towards those with more severe injuries.
