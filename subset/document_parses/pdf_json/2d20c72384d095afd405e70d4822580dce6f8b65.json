We developed a 5 medium-throughput drug screening system and identified a small molecule library of 34 of 430 6 protein kinase inhibitors that were capable of inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 cytopathic effect in human 7 epithelial cells. These drug inhibitors are in various stages of clinical trials. We detected key 8 proteins involved in cellular signaling pathways mTOR-PI3K-AKT, ABL-BCR/MAPK, and DNA-9 Damage Response that are critical for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A drug-protein interaction based 10 secondary screen confirmed compounds such as the ATR kinase inhibitor berzosertib and 11 torin2 with anti SARS-CoV-2 activity. Berzosertib exhibited potent antiviral activity against 12 SARS-CoV-2 in multiple cell types and blocked replication at post-entry step. Berzosertib 13 inhibited replication of SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV as well. Our study highlights key promising 14 kinase inhibitors to constrain coronavirus replication as a host-directed therapy in the treatment 15 of COVID-19 and beyond as well as provides an important mechanism of host-pathogen 16 interactions.",

Berzosertib exhibited an IC 50 =0.48\u00b5M for SARS-CoV2 ( Figure 3A ) with a similar activity 8 against SARS-CoV1 ( Figure 3C ) and MERS-CoV ( Figure 3D ). In comparison remdesivir under 9 the same assay conditions showed an IC 50 =0.15\u00b5M ( Figure 3B ). In an assay conducted with 10 A549-ACE2 cells infected with SARS-CoV-2, berzosertib exhibited an IC50=0.22 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5M; 11 SI=204. Interestingly, it could be demonstrated that berzosertib is acting in a synergistic manner 12 in combination treatment with remdesivir, which showed an IC50 of 0.2 \u00b5M in the same system 13 ( Figure 3F ). The respective inhibition curves and the isobologram are shown in Figure Lastly, we tested berzosertib in a primary human lung tissue culture system consisting of 21 mucociliary air-liquid interface (ALI) cultures derived from primary human tissue (Purkayastha et 22 al., 2020) . Also in this ALI system, berzosertib was effective in inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 ( Figure  23 4A and B). Taken together, our results on a human primary cell system suggest that berzosertib 24 is a potent and safe class of antivirals against coronavirus infections with a low risk of cardiac 25 adverse events. 26 27 We further investigated a potential mode of action of berzosertib in modulating host cellular 28 signaling pathways. Berzosertib is a selective inhibitor of serine/threonine-protein kinase ATR, 29 which is an important member of DNA Damage Response pathway. Berzosertib has been 30 previously shown to block the ATR-CHK1 pathway in cancer cells, with no discernable effect on 31 normal cells (Mei et al., 2019) . In healthy cells, the ATR-CHK1 pathway is required for 32 maintaining cellular genome integrity. ATR kinase is also playing an important role as a Figure S5E ). We observed that Vero E6 cells had higher basal level of pCHK1, however 15 treatment with berzosertib reduced phosphorylation of CHK1 and inhibited SARS-CoV-2 16 infection ( Figure 4C and Figure S5E ). inhibitors are different. Moreover, while one may expect an IC50 on e.g. viral RNA replication in 23 the same range as the IC50 of the ATR kinase inhibition by berzosertib, this is by no means 24 assured. It has to be taken into consideration that the ATR pathway is activated by SARS-CoV-25 2, which will have its effects on the IC50. Our STRING analysis places the ATR pathway into 26 direct context with e.g. the mTOR axis (Figure 1 ), which is known to be vital for SARS CoV- 2 27 pathophysiology. Thus berzosertib activity would be consistent with an on-target mode of action. 28",

DYRK2 has 31 been shown previously to negatively regulate type I interferon induction and a knockdown of 32 in a cancer setting. Although toxicity considered acceptable here, that may not be acceptable in 25 other pathological conditions.

SARS-CoV-2 is a zoonotic virus having similarity with bat SARS-CoV-like 12 viruses(Ramaiah and Arumugaswami, 2020). COVID-19 is a multi-organ disease affecting lung, 13 heart, kidney, and brain(Hou et al., 2020, Xu et al., 2020b, Dolhnikoff et al., Fanelli et al., 2020, 14 Puelles et al., 2020, Lu et al., Paterson et al., 2020). This virus enters into a host cell by binding 15 its transmembrane spike glycoprotein (S protein) to the cellular membrane angiotensin 16 converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor that is expressed in various organs (Kai and Kai, 2020). A 17 gradient of ACE2 expression has been found in the respiratory tract with the highest levels in 18 the nose and decreasing expression in the lower respiratory tract (Hou et al., 2020). In the 19 proximal airway, SARS-CoV-2 infected all cell types, while type 2 alveolar cells (AT2) were 20 found to be infected in the distal airway (Hou et al., 2020). ACE2 is also expressed in other 21 organs such as the kidney, heart, and intestines (Li et al., 2020, Xin Zou, 2020, Xu et al., 22 2020a). The major causes of morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 are acute lung injury with 23 diffuse alveolar damage resulting in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)(Xu et al., 24 2020b). Moreover, there have been reports of patients exhibiting acute kidney injury (Pacciarini 25 et al., 2008, Fanelli et al., 2020, Puelles et al., 2020), vascular inflammation (endotheliitis), and 26 cardiac complications (Varga et al., 2020, Yancy and Fonarow, 2020, Dolhnikoff et al., Grimaud 27 et al., 2020, Belhadjer et al., 2020, Sanna et al., 2020, Escher et al., 2020, Tavazzi et al., 2020, 28 Gnecchi et al., 2020, Craver et al., 2020). Underlying cardiac ailments, diabetes, and obesity 29 are linked to increased risk of mortality (Shi et al., 2020, Fried et al., 2020).

Thus, we used the human induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cardiomyocyte (hiPSC-7 CM) system for antiviral drug testing against SARS-CoV-2. Recent studies have reported that 8 hiPSC-CMs are more efficient at recapitulating cardiovascular diseases at a cellular level(Lan et 9 al., 2013, Sun et al., 2012), and have demonstrated susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection 10 (Sharma et al., 2020). Thus, this cardiomyocyte system is useful for antiviral drug testing 11 against SARS-CoV-2. To evaluate potency, hiPSC-CMs were infected with SARS-CoV-2 and 12 treated with berzosertib (250 nM). Untreated SARS-CoV-2 infected cells had significantly 13 reduced cardiomyocyte beating with non-synchronous twitching of few clusters of cells (Refer to 14 Supplementary Videos). We found treatment with berzosertib stabilized cardiomyocyte function 15 and showed similar beats per minute to uninfected cardiomyocytes (Figure 2A, and 16 Supplementary Videos). Cardiomyocytes were also treated with dactolisib because of its potent 17 antiviral activity to target the mTOR-PI3K-AKT pathway. Although dactolisib inhibited viral 18 production, it affected the cardiomyocyte functional beating, suggesting cardiotoxicity at the 19 tested dose. The inhibition of virus production by berzosertib was evaluated by quantifying 20 infectious virus (TCID50) in the supernatant at various timepoints (Figure 2B). We observed 21 berzosertib treatment significantly reduced the virus production as well as apoptotic cell death 22 associated with viral infection (Figure 2C-D). Infection of cardiomyocytes with SARS-CoV-2 was 23 confirmed by specific staining of cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and viral Spike proteins (Figure 2E). 24 Untreated SARS-CoV-2 infected cells had infection-mediated cell injury with disrupted troponin 25 T fibers.

It is known that many viruses 2 hijack this pathway for efficient replication (Boichuk et al., 2010, Lilley et al., 2007) and this 3 pathway is also modulated by DNA tumor viruses (Pancholi et al., 2017). For example, 4 alphaherpesvirus and BK polyomavirus (BKPyV) have been shown to induce the DDR pathway 5 during infection (Lian et al., 2019, Verhalen et al., 2015). It is apparent that many RNA viruses 6 can induce significant DNA damage, even in cases where viral replication takes place 7 exclusively in the cytoplasm (Ryan et al., 2016, Nguyen et al., 2018). In addition, activation of 8 DDR pathways can contribute positively to replication of viral RNA genomes by switching off cell 9 division which frees up resources for viral replication. Importantly, studies have shown that 10 SARS-CoV-1 induces DNA replication stress pathway partly by interacting with the p125 subunit 11 of DNA polymerase delta through its nonstructural protein (Xin Zou, 2020, Xu et al., 2011).

Studies have revealed that inhibition of ATM or ATR can lead to immune stimulation 2 (Sun et al., 2018, Zhang et al., 2019). ATR inhibition for berzosertib has an IC50 of 19 nM in 3 HT29 cells (according to the vendor Selleckchem).

Thus, our data shows that overall berzosertib has evaluated the characteristics of the SARS CoV-2 inhibition of berzosertib via kinetic 9 experiments.

However, from 8 hours onwards both viral genome and protein production 12 were significantly reduced (Figure 4C-D).
