There are a couple of modest longitudinal studies with CANTAB that present longitudinal data for 18 months or longer in people with early cognitive impairment. The largest of these used CANTAB to assess a cohort including 59 people with MCI followed for 18 to 24 months as part of a study focusing on subjective cognitive decline. A number of different evaluation models were presented, highlighting significantly greater decline in people with MCI than those with subjective cognitive decline in the absence of MCI. 32 Although there are therefore some encouraging data, the potential for practice effects with some of the test batteries is a concern, and larger longitudinal studies in people with MCI and/or early AD are needed to determine sensitivity to change in these individuals across core cognitive domains. The key question of whether computerized neuropsychological assessments could provide a more sensitive approach to the development of a clinical trial neuropsychology composite for people with early AD or MCI requires more evidence from larger longitudinal studies that include at-risk populations and assess core aspects of cognitive function. 24 The current study examines 2 years of cognitive data derived from detailed computerized neuropsychological evaluation of more than 10,000 people over the age of 50, including 1699 with a level of cognitive impairment consistent with stage 2 or stage 3 early AD, to optimize a neuropsychological composite that is sensitive to change.

            "text": "years there have been only two new licensed pharmacological therapies for the treatment of AD: memantine 3 and oligomannate 4 (available only in China). There are no licensed pharmacological treatments for MCI. The last decade has seen a number of high-profile unsuccessful randomized-controlled trials (RCTs) of amyloid immunotherapy and \u03b2-site amyloid precursor protein cleaving enzyme (BACE) inhibitors. 5,6 Although there are more encouraging emerging results for aducanumab, gantenerumab, and BAN2401, 7,8 there are still a very limited number of compounds in phase 2 and phase 3 clinical trials. Improved clinical trial designs are central to the treatment development pipeline. Increasingly the consensus view is that disease-modifying treatments are likely to confer the greatest benefits in people with early AD or MCI. Although this is probably correct, it raises significant challenges. Cognitive decline is often relatively modest and variable at this stage of disease. 9 The most widely used cognitive assessments are not very sensitive to subtle cognitive deficits; consequently, they require large sample sizes to confer appropriate power for clinical trials. 10 This presents a major barrier to conducting trials, adding significantly to the time and cost. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has taken a helpful step with their recent guidance for RCTs, focusing on early preclinical and clinical stages of AD. Within the guidance, early pre-clinical AD is divided into two groups: stage 2 characterized by subtle impairments on sensitive neuropsychological assessments in the absence of functional impairment and stage 3 where there are functional impairments in addition to neuropsychological deficits. The guidelines indicate that an effective intervention would have a \"persuasive effect on sensitive measures of neuropsychological performance.\" 11 Computerized neuropsychological assessments could potentially satisfy this expectation",

A key paper from Grill et al., 10 focusing on a cohort of 364 people with MCI, identified a decline in cognition corresponding to a 3.64 point (standard deviation [SD] 6.76) increase on the ADAS Cog over 2 years. Assuming the same rate of decline and the same variability, a clinical trial would require a cohort of 1046 people per treatment arm to give 80% power with 5% significance (two-sided alpha) to detect a 25% treatment effect. These findings provide an important benchmark against which to test other measures. Composite neuropsychological scores, both paper and pencil and computerized, may provide an advantage over single instruments. Evolving composites include the Preclinical Alzheimer's Cognitive Composite (PACC). 19-21 Developed to maximize sensitivity to change in people who are amyloid positive, PACC has reported encouraging preliminary validation data in a longitudinal cohort of 66 participants. 19 Other emerging scales have combined neuropsychology and functional data. Encouraging baseline data for capturing changes in cognition (CatchCog) have demonstrated good correlation between a three-factor composite (memory, executive function, instrumental activities of daily living) and both informant-reported cognitive decline and cortical atrophy. 20 A 12-month follow-up study has now been reported, showing moderate to high levels of sensitivity to change in 131 people assessed longitudinally, although only 24 of the participants had either subjective cognitive decline or MCI. 21 A further scoring approach, the AD Composite Score (ADCOMS), based on specific items of commonly used dementia assessments from four MCI trials demonstrated potentially improved sensitivity over ADAS Cog and MMSE, although the level of sensitivity was less advantageous for the group with amnestic MCI.22 Although these approaches may lead to valuable composite measures, validation is still relatively preliminary.The CDR System, Cogstate, and CANTAB[23][24][25][26] have led the field in the provision of computerized cognitive testing, but mainly for diagnosis (CANTAB 26 ) or for RCTs of symptomatic treatments such as cholinesterase inhibitors (CDR [eg 27 ]).

The task utilizes similar picture pairs (validated during the original test development), asking subjects to distinguish the original from novel. The task always presented pictures from the same 20 categories. Compared to verbal episodic memory tasks, visual memory tasks reduce bias of language and education, thus being advantageous for multi-center trials with diverse participants. It should be acknowledged though that these assessments were based on recognition and not verbal recall, as recall-based episodic memory tasks are difficult to incorporate into remote computerized tools. The breadth of domains incorporated within FLAME also make the composite potentially applicable for studies of non-AD or mixed dementias and conditions that typically produce cognitive profiles that heavily impact attention, cognitive processing speed, and executive functions, such as \"subcortical\" dementia, but further validation studies are needed.FLAME is a sensitive measure of change in people with stage 2 and stage 3 early dementia and MCI and provides a highly practical and straightforward approach to improving power and reducing sample size for clinical trials focusing on people with early AD, and with potential utility for virtual monitoring of cognitive deficits in the community.
