The objective is to validate advanced 5G features in the cross-border context, such as 5G new radio, mobile edge computing/cloud (MEC), predictive quality of service, software-defined networking (SDN), network slicing and improved positioning systems, all combined together to guarantee that innovative use cases for CCAM can be enabled. In addition, 5GCroCo aims at defining new business models that can be built on top of this unprecedented connectivity and service provisioning capacity, also ensuring that relevant standardization bodies from the two involved industries are impacted. 5GCroCo validation is focused on three use cases: (1) tele-operated driving (ToD), (2) high definition (HD) map generation and distribution for automated vehicles (in short, HD mapping) and (3) anticipated cooperative collision avoidance (ACCA).

This use case imposes high bandwidth demands for uplink video streaming and the need to provide the capacity to control several vehicles in an area. An extra challenge arises from the fact that there is a high risk of correlation of requests for remote drivers to take over control. This is caused by previously described situations for ToD, making it likely that if one vehicle requests the service, other vehicles in the same area will request it as well. Furthermore, involved network infrastructure, as well as backend servers running the application services required for this use case, will likely belong to different domains, e.g. different MNOs. If communication or service orchestration is required across those domains, QoS requirements must still be met end-to-end. This also applies when country borders are crossed. The network should be designed in a way to provide the required QoS with very high reliability. Predictive QoS is required to issue warnings towards the people in the vehicle and the remote operator in the vehicle control center, when potential QoS degradation that may occur in the near future will no longer be capable of addressing the tele-operated service requirements in terms of data rate, latency or availability. Possible consequences depend on previously described situations and automated driving levels, but may include reducing speed, changing the route towards one where the network can support the service, or safely stopping the car. On top of QoS prediction, which is an important base requirement for ToD, the safe remote control of a vehicle requires an overall functional safety concept. This concept development needs to consider the in-vehicle architecture, the 5G communication network architecture with its advanced features and the backend architecture.",

The transmission in uplink therefore needs to provide a combination of reliable high data rates and reliable low latencies as well as a low number of packet errors. In downlink, the commands being sent from the operator to the vehicle need to be in-time and with no end-to-end errors leading to a combination of zero undetected errors while keeping the latency at a reasonable low value.

Brought into V2X context, it can for example mean increasing inter-vehicle distance and, therefore, reducing traffic throughput or even stopping the vehicle.

Previous research activities (e.g. [6] ) have shown that instantaneous information of network failure is often not enough to guarantee functional safety. The vehicle might require time to enter a safe state and might need to rely on communication while doing this, e.g. to inform surrounding cars or query application services about the best possibility to reach a safe state in the current situation. 5CroCo ambition regarding predictive QoS is to broaden the scope from pure Radio Access Network (RAN) to end-to-end evaluation. Redundancy, as key for reliable communication, will be evaluated for RAN, core and backend, with particular focus on how MEC can ensure redundancy, failover and fast recovery mechanisms. 5GCroCo will extend the network with very reliable prediction of the QoS levels for different types of CCAM services that will be evaluated in the context of the project use cases.

The blue line represents the latency for each message sent from the vehicle to the VCoC. The red line is the average latency that is slightly below 100 ms. This plot shows that there is a considerable network jitter can be observed, which is in a comparable order of magnitude to the changes in transfer rates of video data. From these graphs, it follows that data will arrive late at the VCoC, which may negatively impact the ToD task performance of the operator. It is expected that these changes in data rates and latency are less severe with a 5G connection.
