Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, the RI has been converted into a trauma center for the management of patients in the metropolitan area. In the past decades, a similar reorganization occurred another two times, during world wars 1 and 2, when the hospital was directed by Vittorio Putti and Francesco Delitala, respectively, responding to the needs of the community to manage war wounds, fractures and amputees.",

Moreover, a separate ward dedicated to COVID patients holds positive trauma patients admitted from the Emergency Department; it also serves to continue care of patients becoming symptomatic or diagnosed after hospital admission. A separated operating theater, once devoted to the management of infections of the musculoskeletal system, is now used for the management of COVID patients only. At present, most of the trauma cases of the metropolitan area are referred to the RI, except for polytraumas. In this way, the other hospitals of the city of Bologna have more beds and personnel that can be reassigned to the management of COVID casualties, if needed.",

At the time of COVID-19 pandemic, finding a compromise is the key to provide elevated standards of care with an acceptable infective risk: the hospitalization of elective patients can in fact be rationalized and regulated to keep the infection risk as low as possible both for patients and healthcare professionals: a progressive resumption of the volume of surgery, with a gradual increase of number of patients, respecting the health policies of social distancing, may keep the infective risk under control. Moreover, in relation to the uncertain effects of the restrictive measures on virus spread, it is recommended to keep an adequate availability of health resources for COVID casualties.
