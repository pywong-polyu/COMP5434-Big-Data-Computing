            "text": "There is immense concern that the COVID-19 pandemic will increase the risk of child maltreatment as a consequence of disruption and decreased parental mental well-being. [1] [2] [3] Maltreated children often develop impairments in psychological, behavioural and physiological functioning throughout their life. 4 5 Measures to combat the spread of COVID-19 have included school closures and stay-at-home orders, resulting in high levels of parenting stress due to increased demands for parenting and decreased resource availability. The mismatch between demands and resources could increase the underlying risk factors of child maltreatment. [6] [7] [8] The COVID-19 pandemic also has the potential to exacerbate other risk factors, such as parental job loss 9 and social isolation. 10 These negative consequences of the pandemic could disproportionally impact mothers, as women with young children are more likely to have reduced working hours, compared with men, 11 and caring roles continue to be assumed disproportionally by women. 12 13 Besides numerous other challenges during the pandemic, school closures have led to a reduced number of reports of child maltreatment, implying that several cases may have gone unnoticed. 14 Hence, accessible targeted intervention and prevention strategies Strengths and limitations of this study \u25ba The data were from a large population-based cohort, which allowed a prospective assessment of maternal perceived capacity in life, maternal and child covariates at baseline, and use of physical punishment at 2-year follow-up. \u25ba Sample reductions due to missing data were addressed using a full information maximum likelihood. \u25ba However, data on adverse childhood experiences and partner relationship quality were unavailable.",

            "text": "Open access for child maltreatment are required under the social distancing protocols imposed during the pandemic. 15 Adverse childhood experiences, such as exposure to maltreatment and household dysfunction, are wellestablished risk factors for child maltreatment in mothers. 16 However, the impact of adversity could be mitigated by the person's psychological resilience. 17 Resilience refers to the person's capacity to navigate access to resources during adversity. 18 Psychological resilience moderates the effect of childhood adversity on emotion dysregulation. 19 Parenting programmes for child maltreatment prevention sometimes focus on psychological resilience as protective factors, including parents' potential, strengths, knowledge and capacities. 20 Meanwhile, engaging mothers in educational interventions and therapies might be a more challenging task during the pandemic, 21 as they may feel having little capacity to engage in programmes besides lifestyle changes and increased demands for parenting. Although the pandemic-related restrictions have been lifted along with increased full vaccination, several countries have experienced a resurgence. The long-term, uncertain circumstances may cause social deprivations to people who have had limited capacity in life. 22 23 Even in the pre-COVID-19 period, high rates of programme attrition in child maltreatment prevention services were common. 24 Therefore, mothers' perception of their own capacity would be a priority target for child maltreatment prevention. Perceived capacity in life refers to a subjective sense of having sufficient resources to cope with strains and adversity. 25 26 Thus, maternal perceived capacity can form psychological resilience and can be improved through social support and networking that is oriented to increase access to resources of people vulnerable to teenage motherhood and deprivation. 27 Understanding the consequences of mothers' self-perceived capacity can provide valuable insights into identifying opportunities for child maltreatment prevention during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there has been no examination of the longitudinal outcomes of maternal perceived capacity in a child maltreatment framework.",

Furthermore, the use of physical punishment has been linked with an increased risk of mental disorders among children, including mood disorders and anxiety disorders.

Our results contribute to the literature identifying the psychological protective factors for child maltreatment, such as maternal social support, 45 coping skills, 45 46 self-control 45 and self-efficacy. 45 46 These factors constitute psychological resilience, which can change and be fostered over the course of an intervention. 17 18 Notably, the associations did not change after adjusting for annual household income. This is consistent with previous findings, suggesting that cognitive reframing coping may buffer the impact of economic problems on the risk of child maltreatment. 9 Hence, increasing the maternal sense of capacity in financial management has the potential to reduce the impact of economic problems on the risk of child maltreatment. Mothers' perceptions of financial capacity may be distinct from household income, especially in cases where mothers have limited autonomy in household decision-making around finance. Therefore, social work interventions could be beneficial to increase maternal access to information and resources regarding financial management, followed by an increase in maternal sense of capacity.",

Furthermore, our measurement of maternal social support could not classify the support functions and sources.

Other strengths also include its generalisability as the study used data from a large population-based cohort. The use of a full information maximum likelihood estimation enabled us to include participants with missing data in the logistic regression analyses. This study took the first crucial step towards the identification of priorities for future interventions for child maltreatment prevention and the selection of outcome measures to evaluate them. However, the analyses were subject to limitations associated with the primary caregivers' TTC data. The results are based on data from Japanese individuals so that they could not be generalised to populations in other countries. As an instrument to assess perceived capacity was developed for this study, reliability and validity need to be examined. The data did not provide information regarding maternal adverse childhood experiences 16 and partner relationship quality, 43 44 which are also risk or protective factors for child maltreatment. Use of physical punishment was based on self-reported frequency, which may have led to an underestimation of its prevalence. Although 85.4% of mothers enrolled in the TTC wave 1 survey were included in our study, the attrition could have led to biases and our sample may have a better perceived capacity in life. Reports of physical punishment were collected when the child was 14 years old, while the use of physical punishment would be more frequent in younger children. The data also lacked other types of child maltreatment and adversities children may have experienced during the survey period.",
