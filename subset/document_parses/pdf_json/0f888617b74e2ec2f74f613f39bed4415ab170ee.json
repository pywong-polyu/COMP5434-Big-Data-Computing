In the study, PLGA-LPV@M could neutralize multiple proinflammatory cytokines and effectively suppress the activation of macrophages and neutrophils. Furthermore, the formation of NETs induced by COVID-19 patients serum could be reduced by PLGA-LPV@M as well.

However, efficacy of these inhibitors needs to be determined by further research in clinical practice. Besides, due to the fact that pathological inflammation in COVID-19 is orchestrated by a large number of molecules, inhibiting one or a few cytokines may not suppress inflammation enough to reverse the progression of CSS. Recently, strategies that use the immune cell membranes to coat synthetic nano-cores to manage inflammation have caught much academic attention [24] [25] [26] . These nanoparticles inherit the membrane antigenic profile from immune cells, and act as decoys to absorb and neutralize multiple proinflammatory substances from immune cells so as to prevent immune activation [27, 28] . The favorable features of immune cell biomimetic nanoparticles mentioned above inspired us to construct similar systems against the challenge in the treatment of CSS in COVID- 19. Trace to the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19, macrophage seems to be the main immune cell responsible for CSS initiation [29, 30] . When SARS-CoV-2 invade and replicate in host cells, the neighboring macrophages are triggered to generate cytokines and chemokines, leading to accumulation of large amounts of immune cells (including neutrophils and monocytes) in the lung, which ultimately promote further inflammation and result in CSS [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . Besides, the infiltrated neutrophils produce thread-like extracellular structures termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) for virus eradication [36, 37] . However, affected by hyper activated macrophages and persistent infection, excessive NETs are released from neutrophils and induce more inflammation, leading to a further deterioration of CSS [38] [39] [40] .",

In detail, PLGA@M is composed of two parts, one is the macrophage membrane which is used for wrapping on the surface of nanoparticles, and the other is the polymer nanoparticles (PLGA nanoparticles) for drug loading. Due to the surface receptors inherited from macrophage membrane, PLGA@M could disguise itself as a mini macrophage to competitively absorb multiple proinflammatory substances to inhibit the activation of macrophages and neutrophils, and alleviate or prevent the progress of CSS eventually. In addition, driven by the concentration gradient of chemokines and EPR effect (enhanced permeability and retention effect) in the inflammatory environment, PLGA@M could deliver drugs homing into the site of infection. Moreover, the macrophage membranes express the essential SARS-CoV-2 receptor angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE II), which could target SARS-CoV-2 through the affinity between ACE II and spike protein, so as to improve the efficacy of pharmacotherapy [41] [42] [43] .",

In addition, lopinavir (LPV), a broad-spectrum antiviral drug which has been proven effective against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro [44, 45] , was used as model antiviral drug and loaded in the PLGA@M (PLGA-LPV@M). PLGA-LPV@M exhibited enhanced antiviral efficacy compared with uncoated PLGA-LPV nanoparticles in vitro. In a mouse model of coronavirus infection, compared to the free dye ICG and ICG loaded PLGA nanoparticles (PLGA-ICG NPs) groups, more fluorescence was accumulated in PLGA-ICG@M treated group in the infected organs, suggesting the prominent targeted efficacy of PLGA@M nanocarrier. Moreover, the survival rate of coronavirus infectious mice was improved greatly after PLGA-LPV@M treatment, which might owe to the synergistic effect of anti-inflammation and targeted antiviral treatment.

As shown in Fig. 1D , PLGA NPs had no protein expression because there were no covering membranes. Compared to the cell lysate, macrophage membrane vesicles and PLGA@M were enriched with comparable protein bands, which may be related to the fact that cell lysates contain not only membrane proteins but also abundant cell contents. These results suggested that PLGA@M successfully inherited the membranes from macrophages.

PLGA-LPV@M is manifested as a mini macrophage to absorb multiple proinflammatory substances competitively. After that, blocked proinflammatory substances fail to activate macrophages and neutrophils, which reduce the production of cytokines and NETs and alleviate the progression of CSS ultimately. In addition, PLGA-LPV@M could carry drugs homing to the site of viral infection by the inflammatory milieu and EPR effect, and target to the virus, which promote the local accumulation of drugs in the infected tissues, and thus enhance the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy IL-1 receptor (IL-1R), and SAS-CoV-2 crucial receptor ACE II were expressed on the PLGA@M (Fig. 1E) , which implied the potential application of PLGA@M in COVID-19 inhibition treatment.",

Furthermore, the release profiles of LPV from PLGA NPs and PLGA@M were recorded using a UV-Vis spectrophotometer at the wavelength of 267 nm. The release rate of LPV from PLGA@M was lower than membranes uncoated PLGA NPs. Meanwhile, the cumulative release of LPV from PLGA@M was 71.5% less than 95.3% of PLGA NPs in 24 h (Fig. 1G) , suggesting a more prolonged drug release from PLGA@M owing to the coated membranes. Importantly, PLGA-LPV@M exhibited appreciable stability of nanoparticle size over 72 h when suspended in water, 1\u00d7 PBS and 50% serum, respectively (Fig. 1H ).",

Here, we assessed the cytokines neutralizing capability of PLGA@M by introducing IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, which were the crucial representative cytokines of CSS in COVID-19. Briefly, human recombinant cytokines (IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2) were incubated with different doses of PLGA@M, and the residue of cytokines in the supernatant solution was quantified by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). As shown in Fig. 2A , B, 4 mg of PLGA@M could remove 93 pg of IL-6 and 107 pg of IL-1\u03b2, corresponding to cytokines removal yields of 76.9% and 64.8% respectively, which indicated that PLGA@M could sequester these two cytokines effectively. Next, we further evaluated the capability of PLGA@M to inhibit the activation of macrophage and neutrophil induced by cytokines. STAT3, a member of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs) family, has a close relationship with macrophage activation and inflammation development [47, 48] . Here, we detected the phosphorylation levels of STAT3 (p-STAT3) to determine the activation of macrophages. As shown in Fig. 2C , p-STAT3 in macrophages was up-regulated obviously after incubated with IL-6 for 2 h. However, IL-6 induced p-STAT3 in macrophages could be reduced when pretreated with PLGA@M. In addition, myeloperoxidase (MPO) as the biomarker of neutrophils activation was detected in neutrophils under immunofluorescence microscopy [49, 50] . As shown in Fig. 2D , an increased level of MPO (red fluorescence) was expressed in neutrophils after cultured with IL-1\u03b2 for 4 h, however the elevated expression of MPO induced by IL-1\u03b2 could be reduced by PLGA@M (Additional file 1: Fig. S3 ). Therefore, these results indicated that PLGA@M could suppress the cytokines induced activation of macrophages and neutrophils effectively.",

As previously reported [30] , human lung epithelial cells were activated and released proinflammatory substance into the extracellular environment when undergone SARS-CoV-2 infection, as a result, the extracellular proinflammatory factors recruited and activated macrophages for virus eradiation. However, in severe COVID-19 cases, the activated macrophages may cause pathology in lungs. Hence, it would be advantageous for COVID-19 treatment if the process of virus induced macrophage activation could be inhibited by PLGA@M. Biosafety pseudovirus with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein shared same infection mechanism as SARS-CoV-2, hence, the pseudovirus has been developed as a common alternative model of live SARS-CoV-2 [51] . For instance, Ou et al. identified the SAS-CoV-2 receptor, entry pathway and potential drug targets by using SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus system [52] . Bayati et al. developed SARS-CoV-2 S protein pseudovirus to study the virus entry, which confirmed that SARS-CoV-2 used clathrin-mediated endocytosis to get into cells [53] . Besides, Wibmer et al. employed pseudovirus model to evaluate the responses of therapeutically relevant antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 [54] . Based on it, pseudoviruses incorporated with SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (S-pseudoviruses) were used to establish the virus infected lung cellular model (A549 cell) to simulate the SARS-CoV-2 infections in human lung epithelial cells. Compared to the mock group which was bald particles with no spike proteins, the significantly elevated expression level of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, IL-1\u03b2 and TNF-\u03b1) was observed in S-pseudoviruses infected A549 cells (Fig. 3B) , which indicated that the immune response of S-pseudoviruses infected lung cellular model was mainly induced by spike protein rather than lentivirus. After that, we collected the inflammatory supernatant of S-pseudoviruses infected A549 cell to act on macrophages directly, to simulate the activation process of macrophages in patients. As shown in Fig. 3C , the infected supernatant (IS) significantly upregulated expression of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2 in macrophages. While in the presence of PLGA@M, a 100-fold decreased for IL-6 and tenfold decreased for IL-1\u03b2 expression were detected in macrophages, implying the great capability of PLGA@M in inhibiting the inflammation induced by virus infected cells.",

Therefore, it would be an inspirational way for COVID-19 treatment if patient serums induced NETs could be suppressed. As shown in Fig. 3E , after 4 h incubation with patient serum, neutrophils from healthy donors were robustly triggered to undergo NETosis, with fivefold externalization of DNA increased. In contrast, when the patient serum was pretreated with PLGA@M at different concentration for 30 min, they showed decreased externalization of DNA with a dose-dependent inhibition effect. Immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated similar results that extracellular chromatin structures of NETs were reduced by PLGA@M in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 3D) .

Liu et al. suggested that MHV could be used as a valuable tool for the rapid drug screening against SARS-CoV-2, and then the selected drug was further evaluated in SARS-CoV-2 [59] . Besides, MHV was introduced as a suitable surrogate to validate the inactivation of SARS-CoV-2 by UV-C treatment in Pendyala's work [60] . Thus, we used MHV as a surrogated virus of SARS-CoV-2 to verify the antiviral activity of PLGA-LPV@M. To corresponding to the model mouse virus, we selected murine derived macrophages (RAW264.7 cells) as the membranes source of PLGA-LPV@M. Similarly, 4 mg/mL murine macrophage derived PLGA@M exhibited a cytokine removal yield of 98% for mouse IL-6 and 63.8% for mouse IL-1\u03b2 (Additional file 1: Fig. S5 ), which meant that PLGA@M possessed a capacity to neutralize the mouse proinflammatory cytokines as well. Next, MHV was first incubated with PLGA-LPV@M in different dose individually for 1 h, and then the mixtures were added into L929 cells culture plates for 24 h incubation. Considering LPV is a lipophilic drug, free LPV is unstable in aqueous solution, here, water-soluble PLGA-LPV NPs as control group were introduced in this study. As shown in Fig. 3F , both PLGA-LPV NPs and PLGA-LPV@M were able to prevent viral replication in a dose dependent manner, among which, the viral load in PLGA-LPV@M treated group showed slightly lower than PLGA-LPV NPs group. A plausible reason was that PLGA-LPV@M might possess a better affinity to the virus due to the macrophage membranes. Meanwhile, the plaque reduction assay illustrated similar antiviral activity (Fig. 3G) .",

Hence, we conjectured that PLGA@M disguised as mini macrophage remained the analogous effects, which could carry drugs homing into the inflammation sites as well. MHV was highly susceptible to almost all of mouse strains but safe to human, and MHV induced mouse infections was widely used as a surrogated model for human coronavirus study [61] . As Yang et al. reported MHV respiratory infectious mouse model exhibited acute pneumonia syndrome including respiratory symptoms, elevated cytokines and severe lung injuries, which could closely mimick ARDS caused by SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infections [62] . Furthermore, Guo's group established an ARDS mouse model by MHV and SARS-CoV-2, which showed that MHV and SARS-CoV-2 shared an almost uniform immune response [63] . Given the drawback of level three biological confinements and SARS-CoV-2 animal model was difficult to obtain, we constructed the intranasal MHV infected mouse model as SARS-CoV-2 substitution model. As shown in Fig. 5A , coronavirus infected mice had severe inflammatory injury in lung and liver, which was consistent with the pathological features of COVID-19 to a certain extent. Thus, MHV inoculated coronavirus infected mouse model was employed to investigate the targeted delivery efficacy of PLGA@M. In the study, coronavirus infected mice were i.v. injected with free ICG, PLGA-ICG NPs, and PLGA-ICG@M respectively. After 24 h injections, lungs and livers were harvested from all treated mice groups to detect the fluorescence distribution by IVIS system. PLGA-ICG@M treated group exhibited strong fluorescence both in lungs and livers, whereas macrophage membranes uncoated PLGA-ICG NPs treated group showed less fluorescence signals reservation, and few fluorescence was presented in free ICG treated group (Fig. 5B) . Moreover, PLGA-ICG@M only mainly accumulated in livers in healthy mice (Fig. 4C) . These results demonstrated that PLGA@M prefered to reside in inflammation sites when compared to free drugs and uncoated PLGA NPs, which implied that PLGA@M had a favorable potential in targeted therapy application.",

And then the treated mice were sacrificed to obtain lungs and livers for pathologic analysis, viral loads detection and inflammation measurement.

Besides, we examined the viral loads by detecting the mRNA expression level of the virus in the tissues of lungs and livers. Indeed, PLGA-LPV@M reduced the viral loads significantly compared with PLGA-LPV NPs treated group (Fig. 6C) , which was most likely owing to the targeted therapeutic efficacy of PLGA-LPV@M guided by membrane.

PLGA@M inherited the membrane antigenic profile from macrophages and disguised as a mini macrophage to absorb multiple proinflammatory substances competitively. After that, blocked proinflammatory substances failed to activate immune cells, which alleviated the progression of CSS eventually. Furthermore, macrophage-like PLGA@M could carry drugs homing to the site of virus infection by the inflammatory milieu and the EPR effect, which promoted the local accumulation of drugs in infected tissues, thus enhance the effectiveness of pharmacotherapy, and reduce the adverse drug reaction. Owing to the synergistic effects of anti-inflammation and targeted antiviral treatment, LPV loaded PLGA@M exhibited significantly therapeutic effect in the mouse model of coronavirus infection, suggesting that PLGA@M may have similar treatment results when applied in COVID- 19. In severe COVID-19, excessive proinflammatory cytokines and continued infection resulted in uncontrolled formation of NETs, which induced the harmful amplification loop between inflammation and tissue damage [64, 65] . For these reasons, NETs were proposed as novel therapeutic targets in COVID-19 [66, 67] . In this study, PLGA@M manifested the talent in suppressing the formation of NETs induced by COVID-19 patient serum, suggesting that PLGA@M could play a multi-role in the treatment of COVID-19, and offer a comprehensive therapeutic benefit to patients. Meanwhile, NETs also engaged in the progression of multiple diseases including cardiovascular diseases [56, 68] , rheumatoid arthritis [69] , diabetes [70] , cancer [71, 72] and so on, which meant that PLGA@M may have a potential to treat these diseases as well. However, the detailed mechanisms of how PLGA@M remove NETs and the possibility of clinical application still needed further exploration.",

For the first step, PLGA cores were formulated using poly (d, l-lactide-coglycolide) (50:50 PLGA, Aladdin, China) through a nanoprecipitation method. Briefly, 10 mg PLGA was first dissolved in 1 mL acetone, and then 3 mL of water was added rapidly. The solution was then placed in the fume hood and stirred for 4 h to remove the organic solvent. To load Lopinavir (LPV, Meilune, China) or Indocyanine green (ICG, Aladdin, China) into PLGA cores, 0.5 mg LPV or 0.6 mg ICG was mixed separately with 10 mg PLGA in 1 mL acetone. In the second step, PLGA cores were mixed with membranes at a polymer-to-membrane protein weight ratio of 1:0.5. The mixture was then interacted by using a bath sonicator with a frequency of 42 kHz and a power of 100 W for 5 min. After coated with membranes, PLGA@M was purified by centrifugation at 16,000g for 10 min to remove unbound membrane fragments. Then nanoparticles were measured for hydrodynamic size and surface zeta potential with Zetasizer (Malvern, UK). The stability of nanoparticles in 50% serum and 1\u00d7 PBS was examined within 72 h. Nanoparticles were confirmed with transmission electron microscopy (TEM, JEM-1400 PLUS 120 kV). Briefly, 3 \u03bcL of nanoparticle suspension (1 mg/mL) was deposited onto a glow-discharged carbon-coated copper grid. Five minutes after the sample was deposited, the grid was rinsed with 10 drops of distilled water, and then stained with a drop of 1 wt% uranyl acetate.
