According to our current understanding of the pathophysiology, different phases of virus and host interactions characterize SARS-CoV-2 infection [2] [3] . Following the incubation period, a high viral replication triggers the innate immune response. A strong inflammatory syndrome and the onset of the adaptive immune response characterize the second phase of Covid-19 before recovery or worsening. Severe forms of Covid-19 are associated with an excessive release of cytokines, known as a \"cytokine storm\", occurring generally during the second phase of the disease [4] . The administration of corticosteroids reduces death and time to recovery [5, 6] , and interleukin-6 antagonist Tocilizumab also have obtained encouraging results [7] [8] [9] .",

The kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the upper respiratory tract during the course of Covid-19 is well established, with high concentrations observed during the initial phase, followed by a rapid decrease in the second week after the onset of symptoms, and a low or undetectable level of RNA later [7] . The viral loads of asymptomatic or mild forms of SARS-CoV-2 infections are similar to severe forms [10] . Studies suggest that SARS-CoV-2 RNA decreases faster in mild/asymptomatic infections and in young subjects compared to severe forms and elderly subjects [11, 12] . The presence of SARS-CoV-2 components also has been reported outside the respiratory tract, such as in blood, stool and saliva. When detected, the plasma SARS-CoV-2 RNA level is generally low. The detection of SARS-CoV-2 is also found in extrapulmonary organs of immunocompromised patients, including heart, kidney, liver, and spleen [13] . However, no case of SARS-CoV-2 transmission via transfusion has been described [14] . On the other hand, the presence of the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid has been reported in the blood of Covid-A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 4 19 patients. Circulating antigen (Ag) is detectable in almost all hospitalized patients in the early phase of the disease [15, 16] . A high level of nucleocapsid antigenemia (N-Ag) could be associated with severe forms of Covid-19 and the presence of circulating SARS-CoV-2 RNA [17, 18] .",

Using mass spectrometry, Mishra C et al. have reported detection of nucleocapsid-derived peptides in urine of a third of Covid-19 patients [33] . Our results using a highly sensitive immunoassay demonstrate the presence of N-antigen in urine in most of Covid-19 hospitalized patients during the first two weeks after onset of the symptoms. The kidney is among the most frequently affected extrapulmonary organs during SARS-CoV-2 infection, and varying degrees of renal damage have been reported in Covid-19 patients [34, 35] . Acute kidney disease was observed in a quarter of the patients included in our study. We did not observed any association between urine N-Ag levels and altered renal function. N-Ag in urine may originate from the blood and be excreted by the kidney, as suggested by the correlation between N-Ag concentrations in blood and urine. The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid is a 46 kd protein. The glomerular permeability and filtration probably permit the excretion of this small-size protein. However, after seroconversion against the nucleocapsid, immune complexes also form, with a size that makes them unable to be filtered. Of note, although Covid-19 associated glomerular disease has been reported, this type of kidney injury A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 9 seems infrequent among acute kidney diseases associated to SARS-CoV-2 infection [36] . A local production of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid may be another possible origin of the antigen detected in urine. Alongside hypoxia, circulating disorder and inflammation, SARS-CoV-2 infection may directly contribute to kidney injury. Cells expressing ACE2 are present in the tubules, and studies have shown that SARS-CoV-2 RNA, nucleocapsid and spike protein accumulate in tubules [22, 37] .",

We observed a moderate correlation between N-Ag in blood and urine, perhaps better if the couple of blood and urine were collected in the same time but the kinetic of this marker may be different in these two compartments [13] . The development of anti-nucleocapsid humoral response may induce the formation of immune complexes that interfere with N-Ag quantification in blood. Hence, after seroconversion N-Ag and N-IgG levels may represent only the unbound fraction available to be measured by the immunoassays. In urine, antibodies directed against nucleocapsid were only detected in one quarter of the patients who tested positive for circulating N-IgG, limiting the risk of underestimation of N-Ag levels by the immunoassay. In other words, N-Ag levels in urine may be more accurate since nucleocapsid Ag quantitation in urine is probably less impacted by the formation of immune Ag-Abs complexes compared to blood. N-Ag in urine may better reflect disseminated infection than nucleocapsid antigenemia, especially after seroconversion against SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein. Besides interfering with assay measurement, the presence of circulating antibodyantigen complexes may bind FC receptors activating monocytes/macrophages, and fuel the hyper inflammation observed in the second phase of Covid-19 [38] .",

The analysis of blood N-Ag according to serological status against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid showed lower concentrations in N-IgG positive patients compared to N-IgG negative patients. However, most patients (81.36%) who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid IgG remained positive for blood N-Ag (Figure 3.B). The level of N-Ag in the urine was also significantly lower in patients who tested positive for circulating anti-N IgG compared to N IgG negative patients, but we observed a less pronounced difference between the two groups than in blood and both differ by about 1 log10 (Figure 3.A). Cycle threshold (CT) results of SARS-CoV-2 RNA PCR in nasopharyngeal swabs were not correlated with urine N-Ag level (r=-0.24, p = 0.1077; Figure 3.C), and weakly correlated with blood N-Ag (r=-0.35, p = 0.0162; Figure 3.D).Urine samples also were assessed for antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid(Figure 4). All patients tested negative for nucleocapsid antibodies in plasma tested also negative for both N-IgA and N-IgG in urine (data not shown). Signal ratios for N-IgA and N-IgG were higher in urine samples collected after seroconversion has occurred (p <0.0001). Using the same threshold as for plasma, N-IgA were detected in 17/82 patients (20.7%), and N-IgG in 6/82 patients (7.3%). All urine samples from SARS-CoV-2 negative controls tested negative for N-IgG and N-IgA (data not shown).High urinary N-Ag levels are associated with admission in intensive care unitsPatients had higher urinary N-Ag levels when hospitalized in intensive care units (ICU) compared to medical wards (p=0.0077). The levels were higher in ICU seronegative hospitalized patients (p=0.0112), and a trend toward a higher level of N-Ag was observed in ICU seropositive patients (p=0.0559) (Figure 5.A). Blood N-Ag levels were also higher in patients hospitalized in ICU compared to medical wards (p=0.0250)(Figure 5.B). The ROC curves show that both high urine and blood N-Ag levels were predictive of a condition requiring intensive care (Figure 5.C, D). A higher accuracy was observed for urine N-Ag as a predictor of severe Covid-19 compared to blood N-Ag, especially on seronegative patients (AUC: 0.8300 vs 0.7115, respectively).",
