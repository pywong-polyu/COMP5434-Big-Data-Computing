            "text": "Interstitial lung disease (ILD) is a term for a cluster of conditions comprising Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) [1] . Fibrotic ILD such as IPF is exemplified by fibrotic destruction of the lung parenchyma concerning medical performance and prediction. IPF is an intensifying fibrotic lung disease linked with a desolate prognosis and an average survival of around three years [2] . However, in clinical practice, the path of the disease in specific patients may fluctuate significantly. Pulmonary fibrosis is a progressive disease that usually degrades over time. is degradation is known as the extent of fibrosis which is the scarring inside the lungs [2] . Patients with this disease experience the evolution of fibrosis at vastly different rates. Some patients develop the scarring slowly and bear with the disease for several years, whereas others deteriorate more quickly, leading to death [3] . When scarring occurs, the patient finds it difficult to breathe normally, which eventually leads to shortness of breath even when the person is not performing any strenuous exercise [4] . Patients with this disease display fibrotic sections, honeycombing, and wide-ranging patchy ground-glass areas with or without consolidations, depicting the presence of pleural fluid within the CT scans [5] . Hence, biomedical imageries are a massive source of knowledge beneficial to feed analytical tools within revealing pathologies [6] . But due to the extreme unpredictability of this disease, it becomes a challenging task even for qualified radiologists, further making it even harder for the doctors to determine the prognosis in patients with IPF. e evolution of the disease in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is assessed by the decrease in Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) [7] . FVC is a measurement used to determine the lung function of the patients; it is measured by an instrument called a spirometer, which measures the amount of air inhaled and then exhaled [8] . Forced Vital Capacity (FVC) has been proved as the most efficient magnitude for years to evaluate and gather information about the functional status of patients with fibrotic lung diseases; a deterioration of FVC is considered as a sign of progression of the disease. Despite dependable tendencies of FVC deterioration in the pulmonary fibrosis patients, the trend of the progression in patients is not very predictable, and significant variability in FVC is detected over time [7] .",

It represents a pattern existing in the lung's CT image, categorized by small cystic airspaces, ranging up to several centimeters at times.

            "text": "e proposed FVC-Net model used metadata and CT scan images to predict FVC and measured its performance through the modified Laplace Log-Likelihood score (\u22126.641). FVC-Net achieved a significant improvement compared to EN, EQR, LR, RF, and other models reported in the literature. e proposed method further states that highresolution CT, evaluated by the proposed deep learning algorithm, provides a low-cost, fast, and accurate way to find the decline in the lung function of a patient suffering from pulmonary fibrosis. is method could be of great advantage to facilities where thoracic imaging expertise is inadequate to make prognosis for doctors easier. As future work, the model's performance can be assessed in the precise determination of the decline rate in FVC for COVID-19 affected patients. Further, a user interface can be created where the medical staff can upload the patient's FVC values, and the CT scans to study the trends in their FVC. is will make the prognosis less complex, and the doctors can find the most optimal way to treat the patients suffering from IPF.",
