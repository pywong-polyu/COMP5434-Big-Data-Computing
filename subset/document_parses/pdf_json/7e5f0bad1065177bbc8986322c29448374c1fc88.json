When using UVC-LED box 2, 135 SARS-CoV-2 was almost completely inactivated after 3 and 10 minutes of irradiation at a distance 136 of 1 cm (3 minutes: Glass: 97.49\u00b10.35%, metal: 99.21\u00b10.1%, plastic: 98.74\u00b10.16%; 10 minutes: 137 Glass: 97.85\u00b10.27%, metal: 99.42\u00b10.08%, plastic: 99.46%; Fig. 4B). At a distance of 4 cm, SARS-138 CoV-2 was completely inactivated on glass and metal and almost completely on plastic 139 (99.89\u00b10.2%) after 10 minutes of irradiation (Fig. 3B and 4B). 140 Taken together, our data demonstrate that UVC-LED sterilization boxes can effectively inactivate 141 SARS-CoV-2 on surfaces such as glass, plastic or metal. 142 143 Discussion 144 SARS-CoV-2 is transmitted through direct contact with infected individuals, by virus-containing 145 aerosols and potentially via contact with virus-contaminated surfaces (3). In the present study, we 146 investigated the performance of UVC-LED sterilization boxes on the inactivation of SARS-COV-147 2 on surfaces such as glass, metal and plastics that are typically found on personal items like 148 smart phones, credit cards or keys. We demonstrated that UVC-LED boxes can effectively 149 inactivate SARS-CoV-2 on glass, metal and plastic. Independent of the used UVC-LED box and 150 the materials, SARS-CoV-2 could be almost completely inactivated after 3 minutes exposure 151 (UVC-LED box 1: 1 cm: 44.1 mJ/cm 2 , 5 cm: 11.7 mJ/cm 2 ; UVC-LED box 2: 1cm: 21.06 mJ/cm 2 ), 152 which represents the standard exposure time provided by the UVC-LED boxes. Even 10 seconds 153 of exposure strongly reduced viral loads on the contaminated surfaces. The findings are in line 154",

            "text": "160 has been reported that distance and angle of UVC light source in closed box systems are 161 important factors for irradiance over respirator surfaces (11). UVC-LED box 1 and 2 showed a 162 similar reduction of viral load for the materials glass and plastic. At a distance of 5 cm from the 163 LED of UVC-LED box 1, although the viral load was reduced by 91.92\u00b11.85% on glass, 164 98.52\u00b10.42% on metal and 92.56\u00b11.7% on plastic, the emitted light intensity (65 \u00b5W/cm 2 ) was 165 not sufficient to completely inactivate the virus after 10 minutes exposure. The mirror at the bottom 166 of UVC-LED box 2 may have contributed to facilitate the inactivation of the virus. Van Doremalen 167 et al. (4) indicated that a SARS-CoV-2 stock with a viral concentration of 10 5 TCID50/mL 168 corresponds to cycle-threshold values between 20 and 22, which is similar to the thresholds of 169 samples from the upper and lower respiratory tracts of infected individuals. In this study, SARS-170 CoV-2 stocks with even higher viral concentrations of about 10 6 TCID50/mL were used for the 171 inoculation of the materials. Overall, both UVC-LED boxes were highly effective in inactivating the 172 high titer viral stocks of SARS-CoV-2. These encouraging results make the UVC-LED boxes an 173 affordable option for the public to disinfect a variety of items, including phones, watches, 174 headphones, masks, makeup utensils, as long as the item size fits the device. As SARS-CoV-2 175 can also be detected on different surfaces in hospital environment (12, 13), UVC-LED boxes might 176 also be an effective tool for environmental decontamination in hospitals. Schematic illustrations of the UVC-LED boxes used for UVC-disinfection. A) UVC-195 LED box 1 (Horcol) was equipped with lateral UVC-LEDs. B) UV-LED box 2 (expondo GmbH, 196 Berlin, Germany) was equipped with UVC-LEDs incorporated in the lid and a mirror installed at 197 the bottom of the chamber.198",
