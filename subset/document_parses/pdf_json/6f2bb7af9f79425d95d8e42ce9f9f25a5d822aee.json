It would be interesting to note that major dental work such as new dentures would fall under this category.",

            "text": "Finally, in relation to orthodontic treatment 3 this author mentions the use of self-etch primers (SEP) to avoid an AGP, however the technique of applying SEP involves gentle air drying according to some manufacturers, making it a potential AGP. There is also a mention of utilising light cured resin modified GIC, but this material does not require a dry field and in fact, the surface of the enamel should be moist during bonding to ensure success. 6 The author suggests hand trimming of excess composite/flash with a scalpel. An alternative to this would be to utilise either: band removing pliers (posterior teeth), hand scalers/Mitchell's trimmers (incisors) or adhesive removing pliers. 6 Minimal remnants of residual material on the enamel surface can be lost with time as a result of toothbrushing. 6 V. Sahni, New Delhi, India https://doi.org/10.1038/s41415-020-2117-2 workers. 2 The mechanism of action of PVP-I relies primarily on the free iodine component, which is bound to a large polyvinylpyrrolidone molecule (PVP) acting as a carrier to deliver I 2 to target cells. However, the viricidal activity of PVP-I is highly associated with its I 2 content: the commonly used 10% PVP-I can only deliver 1-3 ppm of I 2 in a compound of more than 31,600 ppm of total iodine atoms. The high percentage of bounded 'non-active' iodine contributes to all the undesirable toxicological and staining properties of PVP-I. 3 A new generation of iodine-based antiseptics 'super iodine' was initiated recently to overcome the compositional side effects of PVP-I. Therefore, ioTech International (Boca Raton, FL) produced a patented aqueous solution of I 2 that contains over 100 times more I 2 than PVP-I and comes in various forms ready for prophylactic use including mouthwash, nasal spray, and hand cleanser. 4 Moreover, the non-bioactive iodine content was reduced from 31,600 ppm in PVP-I to several hundred in the new formula thus accelerating its effect, increasing its shelf-life, and minimising its potential irritancy and mucosal staining.",

When this figure is combined with the average number of patients that we have seen each week, since lockdown was eased, and the local population, this enables us to quantify the risk of us seeing an undiagnosed COVID-19 patient in the practice.
