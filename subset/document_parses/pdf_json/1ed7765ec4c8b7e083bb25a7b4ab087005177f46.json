Although the aviation market is a major entry point for viruses, little is known about how flight attendants view the risk of COVID-19 and whether they follow individual-organizational-governmental NPI protocols. Guided by protection motivation theory (Rogers, 1975) , this study proposed an NPI model tailored specifically to the airline industry and examined how an extended NPI would affect job satisfaction and customer orientation of Korean flight attendants (n = 371). Results revealed that perceptions of COVID-19 are positively related to three types of NPIs, which in turn positively influenced job satisfaction and customer orientation. Given that the examined three types of NPIs had not been paid attention in previous research, the study's proposed conceptual model should better guide the airline industry in protecting its flight attendants with NPI strategies inside and outside aircraft.",

A recent survey by the International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports that more than half (55%) of respondents would not travel in 2020 due to the fear of COVID-19 (IATA, 2020) . In April 2020, passenger numbers fell by more than 70% compared to the previous year (Curley et al., 2020) . While the aviation market has continued to operate, it has done so at a significantly reduced rate. One underlying concern, beyond economics, is that flight attendants may be exposed to a high-level risk of infection (Hawkins, 2020) . Following the H1N1 pandemic in , World Health Organisation (2009 warned that the influenza virus can travel on aircraft as far as two rows ahead and two rows behind a contagious passenger. Not surprisingly, COVID-19 has infected hundreds of flight attendants since March 2020 (Wallace, 2020) .",

While some flight attendants have been required to work during the outbreak, little is known about how they generally view the risk of COVID-19 and whether they trust their employers, governments, or medical advice. By sampling South Korean flight attendants, this study classified the perceived risk of COVID-19 as an obstacle that undermines the employees' work behavior and performance. According to protection motivation theory (Rogers, 1975) , people will likely participate in self-protective behavior if they feel threatened. For this reason, we believe flight attendants who are afraid of or risk-averse to COVID-19 will likely participate in a recommended course of health preventive actions such as non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) while working on aircraft.",

It affected more than 8,000 people in more than 25 countries and led to nearly 800 deaths (Muzzatti, 2005) . Some researchers maintained that airline passengers were the major cause of the SARS pandemic (John et al., 2005) . For example, the source of SARS in Canada was found to be Canadian female passenger who had visited Hong Kong by air and later tested positive (Varia et al., 2003) . From this one person, the virus spread rapidly to major Canadian cities, causing 44 deaths and hundreds of confirmed cases (Tam, 2018) . Subsequently, a travel advisory was issued by the World Health Organization for countries where SARS cases were significant. Hence, governments in China, Taiwan, and Singapore imposed 14-day-quarantines for travelers who visited infected areas (McKercher and Chon, 2004) . In Thailand travelers arriving from affected areas were ordered to wear face-masks during their stay, and failure to comply could lead to fines and/or imprisonment (McKercher and Chon, 2004) . Further, the media's coverage related to SARS increased the public's fear and anxiety and affected travelers' perceptions of air transportation which contributed to a decline in international travel that lasted for several years (Clegg, 2010) .",

However, we do not know how organizational NPIs (e.g., providing masks, seat distancing) and governmental NPIs guidelines (e.g., pre-flight COVID-19 testing) influence the work behaviors of flight attendants during a pandemic. For this reason, we propose an NPI scale for the airline industry that includes measures at three levels: individual, organizational, and governmental.",

To increase public awareness of COVID-19, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) has regularly published new infection numbers on television, websites, and mobile apps (UNDP, 2020). Through its cell broadcasting service, the government also provides emergency text messaging to millions of mobile users giving specific times and places of infection points (UNDP, 2020). Additionally, the KDCA has drafted NPI guidelines specifically for airlines (CDC, 2021), which include wearing masks (both passengers and crews) beginning in the departure hall, prohibiting airport smoking zones, providing hygiene kits to arriving passengers and crews, encouraging passengers to use self-service kiosks for printing boarding passes, and bag tags, and providing COVID-19 diagnostic tests upon arrival.

Conclusive evidence for the most critical attributes (e.g., organizational/governmental NPI) remains understudied and researchers have not carefully investigated how people view pandemics and/or cope with organizational/governmental NPI guidelines. Given the rise in the number of air travelers and growing government expectations for hygienic airport environments (Park and Almanza, 2020) , NPI research needs further investigation and an appropriate tool should be developed for flight crews who, along with their individual protective behaviors, follow airline and government guidelines. The present study, therefore, extends this to three types of NPI (i.e., individual-NPI, organizational-NPI, and governmental-NPI).

Furthermore, Nielsen et al. (2011) revealed that having a range of safety and health procedures can positively influence employee job satisfaction. It is likely, then, consistent with the above evidence, that flight attendants who follow self-protective behaviors based on organizational and governmental NPI guidelines are more likely to be satisfied with their work.

Standardized factor loadings ranged from 0.57 to 0.95, average variance extracted (AVE) values ranged from 0.42 to 0.87. According to Fornell and Larcker (1981) , if AVEs are less than 0.5, the convergent validity is still acceptable if composite reliability (CR) is higher than 0.6. Hence, these results suggest the measurement model had convergent validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981; Hair et al., 2010) . Further, all constructs had CR values higher than 0.6 (ranged from 0.68 to 0.95), suggesting the measurement model was reliable (Hair et al., 2010) . Further, as shown in Table 4 , AVEs for all constructs were greater than the corresponding coefficients of squared correlations, suggesting discriminant validity (Fornell and Larcker, 1981) .",

EFA identified eight NPI items which we classified into three domains: 'individual NPI', 'organizational NPI', and 'governmental NPI'. Results revealed that the new edition of the NPI model for the airline industry was valid. The study's results confirmed that perception of COVID-19 was a significant predictor of all three-types of NPI. Further, the three NPI domains were found to be significantly associated with job satisfaction which influence customer orientation. Based on these results, this study provides both theoretical and practical implications for the airline research and industry.",

Even though the original NPI model developed by Lee et al. (2012) received considerable attention from tourism scholars and practitioners, it proposed only a personal level of NPI. Thus, it is believed the present study contributes to airline studies by extending NPI to three types of NPI that can be treated as a multi-dimensional construct: individual, organizational, and governmental NPI. It is believed that the proposed conceptual model provides a more structured and inclusive explanation of the roles NPIs play during pandemics, compared to previous studies (e.g., Chung et al., 2021; Lee et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Second, the findings of this study revealed that protection motivation theory better explains the behaviors of flight attendants during pandemics. The theory posits that people are more likely to use healthprotective behaviors when they believe that a threat is real and clearly understood (Rogers, 1975) . In recent tourism research, for example, Zheng et al. (2021) explored the relationship between travel fear and self-protection among Chinese travelers. They found that passengers who fear traveling or feel threatened by COVID-19 were highly motivated to engage in protective activities (Zheng2021). Consistent with protection motivation theory (e.g., Rogers, 1975; Zheng et al., 2021) , the current study found that flight attendants utilized health protective guidelines and followed all three-types of NPI procedures to reduce the risk of infection. This indicates that when flight attendants perceived COVID-19 as dangerous, they were more likely to engage in personal (e. g., washing hands), organizational (e.g., wearing personal protective equipment at work), and governmental NPIs (e.g., complying with the Korean government's infection prevention guidelines). This suggests that the protection motivation theory can be applied to the airline crew in the context of COVID-19. Third, the present study also contributes to the literature by shedding light on the relationship between perception of COVID-19 and job satisfaction. Because perception of COVID-19 has led to greater interest in airline research, several recent studies have focused on travelers perceptions of COVID-19 and how they impact travel intentions and willingness to fly (Elizabeth et al., 2021; Lamb et al., 2020; Li and Ito, 2021; Neuburger and Egger, 2020; Xu et al., 2021) . Nevertheless, how employees (e.g., airline staff) perceive the recent pandemic and how their perceptions influence job satisfaction remains understudied. Therefore, it is believed to be important to investigate flight attendants' perspectives on infectious disease since the perceived threat of COVID-19 can lead to reduced job satisfaction (Nielsen et al., 2011; Xie et al., 2020) . Consistent with previous studies, this study revealed that flight attendants with high-risk perceptions of COVID-19 had much lower job satisfaction. Thus, the current research model contributes to the air transport literature by identifying a significant relationship between perception of COVID-19 and job satisfaction.",

            "text": "The study's findings also have several managerial implications. The significant positive relationship between perception of COVID-19 and all three types of NPI suggests that companies should work to increase flight attendants' awareness of the seriousness of influenza-type diseases and have comprehensive training to minimize the risk. Karanci et al. (2005) revealed that a disaster-awareness-training-program can be an effective strategy to raise risk perception. In their study, adults who participated in the risk-awareness-training program had higher threat perceptions and better preparedness behavior compared to non-participants (Karanci et al., 2005) . This suggests the need for flight attendants to receive appropriate risk awareness training. Like doctors and nurses, pilots and flight attendants must also learn to identify symptoms of influenza-type diseases. Management could do this by providing documents and memos that alert aviation workers to new information regarding COVID-19. Moreover, weekly video meetings (e.g., Skype and Zoom) with health specialists and the provision of text-alerts about daily confirmed that new cases could help flight attendants to remain up-to-date and prepared to implement protocols related to NPIs.",

As indicated in this study, governmental NPI were the most significant indicator leading to flight attendants' job satisfaction. In other words, NPI guidelines, resources, and directions obtained from the government not only helped flight attendants to maximize safety, but also played an important role in increasing work satisfaction, which, in turn, bolstered their confidence when serving passengers (i.e., customer orientation). This implies that flight attendants have a high level of trust and reliance on governmental NPI. In this regard, organization and government related health officials should work together to provide a suitable NPI checklist, guidelines, and counseling programs to help overcome the difficulties that flight attendants presently confront. Additionally, hiring or inviting risk management specialists to educate flight attendants could enhance their job satisfaction during a pandemic.",

Working in an environment where they need to wear facial masks, safety glasses, and gowns for long hours, has likely made it difficult for flight attendants to perceive their jobs as satisfying. One way to assist with job satisfaction would be to have employees work fewer hours; allow ultra-long-haul flights to bypass busy international hubs (Bauer et al., 2020) , and give them more rest time to aid in recovering from physical/emotional stresses caused by the pandemic. Management should also offer their flight attendants consistent testing of COVID-19 and provide them a \"pandemic bubble\", \"COVID-19-free-campus\", or \"isolation zone\" to which only aviation personnel have access. Controlling all aviation workers in a designated area and blocking unauthorized visitors could help flight attendants to feel safe.",

Given that the sample consisted solely of South Korean flight attendants, it may be difficult to generalize the results to other airlines. Attendants of other ethnicities may have different perceptions of COVID-19 and use different NPI strategies. In particular, it is possible that respondents from Western cultures might find more utility in individual NPI than governmental or organizational NPIs. Hence, future investigations should include flight attendants from other ethnicities and conduct cross-cultural studies (eastern vs. western flight attendants). Moreover, the study's proposed conceptual model examined the relationship between perception of COVID-19 and NPIs from the perspectives of flight attendants. It would be interesting and worthwhile to apply this conceptual model to other service industries. Lastly, future research is recommended to test alternative models such as reverse mediation which examines the indirect effect of job satisfaction on NPIs via perception of COVID-19. The findings of alternative models may provide better understanding of the pandemic and provide further implications in the airline industry. ",
