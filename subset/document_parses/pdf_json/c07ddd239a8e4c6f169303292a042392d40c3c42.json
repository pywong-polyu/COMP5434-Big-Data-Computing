The purpose of this study is to get a better understanding of its flight dynamics. It is an underactuated system. So, a simplified and clear model is needed to implement controllers on these kind of unmanned aerial systems. In addition, a computational tool is used for validation purposes. For future works embedded or intelligent control systems can be developed to control them. Gyroscopic and some aerodynamics effects are neglected.",

Aircrafts are not the only ones with flight capacities. There are other flying vehicles like drones or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) which can do so. Hence, there have been many researchers and engineers from different areas interested in developing aerial vehicles without the influence of humans. Several engineering areas such as aerodynamics, control, embedded electronics are associated to this type of systems. These type of vehicles can have small designs that favor their abilities for carrying or payload. The term drones has been used because of the autonomy constraints they could have. This is the reason why embedded and guidance control systems are applied to drones which permit autonomous flight tasks. One of the categories of UAVs is the multirotor which has the possibility of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL). Nowadays, unmanned aerial vehicles play a very meaningful role in the current aerospace industry. They can provide different autonomous flight applications such as environmental research, rescue, traffic monitoring, agricultural inspections, image and video, scientific research, inspections of places with very difficult access and even more recently, home delivery of products. Therefore, it is important to remark that their uses are not just limited to dangerous roles. Due to the great progress of technology, UAVs have been evolving up to autonomous systems. They are capable of running by themselves without any kind of interventions from humans and with a pre-determined flight mission. Therefore, this fact has drawn the attention to research more in-depth about autonomous aircrafts [3, 10, 16, 17 ].",

The use of additional reference frames will make the derivation of the equations of motions easier. When using multiple reference frames there is one important issue which is related to the transformation of vector coordinates from one frame to another. The rotation matrices used are based on the Euler angles. A reference fixed frame is applied to determine distance and direction. A coordinate system is used to represent measurements in a frame. In flight dynamics there are two reference frames clearly defined, the Earth Fixed Frame and Body Fixed Frame [5, 12, 14, 17] . The E-frame is chosen as the inertial frame.",

Since a complete math model is provided, other variables such as thrust and drag coefficients as well as motor inertia are involved in the flight control analysis. Therefore, after performing several control simulations and some gain adjustments, it can be seen that PD control has a good response getting a better and quick stabilization of the vehicle. Also, when the moments of inertia are of very small values, attitude stabilization is more difficult. Some overshoot or peaks are also noticed in attitude angles. For altitude, peaks are not really evident. The PID gains are computed as well. Additional corrections are required as some signal deviations from the desired references are observed.

It could be used to predict changes in position and orientation of a quadcopter at a given point in time. It can be achieved by varying the rotors speed. Equations are inverted to find inputs needed for a certain position. Additionally, there are six degrees of freedom and just four inputs. Therefore, it is not appropriate and a simplified dynamics model would be required to be then implemented for control purposes. Also, there are some sensor measurements that are based on the E-frame and not on sensors frames. This model approach can be adapted to consider voltage inputs and not just U since there is an important association between thrust and voltage. It is necessary to adjust control gains. So, the smaller the moments of inertia and mass the more difficult for the platform to stabilize. State estimation would have a significant role because of an estimation of sensor measurements is necessary for autopilots design.",
