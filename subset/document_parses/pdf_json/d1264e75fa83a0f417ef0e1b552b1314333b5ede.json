On March 11, 2020 , the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic, and by March 26, 2020, it had spread to almost 199 countries and territories worldwide with more than 462,680 cases and around 20,834 deaths [4] . The COVID-19 pandemic reached Pakistan on February 26, 2020, when a student in Karachi tested positive upon returning from Iran. By March 18, cases had been registered in all four provinces [5] . In Punjab, there were 1,493 cases, Sindh 881 cases, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 405 cases, Balochistan 191 cases, Gilgit Baltistan 210 cases, Azad Jammu and Kashmir 15 cases, and Federal (ICT) 82 cases for a total of 3,277 cases [5] .",

Similarly, surgical procedures have been minimized or temporarily suspended to address the overwhelming and devastating increase in COVID-19 patient care needs [6] . However, decisions regarding surgical intervention in this resource-scarce time need rigorous ethical and clinical evaluation [7] . In this pandemic era, all healthcare providers must follow standardized essential perioperative measures including the use of personal protective equipment (PPEs) to control disease transmission and avoid unwanted complications. All patients need to be managed as COVID-19 patients until confirmed by testing. Elective procedures should be postponed, and only urgent, lifesaving procedures and oncologic surgeries should be performed that are associated with worse outcomes if delayed [2] .",

Organizations such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), WHO, American College of Surgeons have recommended postponing/rescheduling elective surgeries to prevent the spread of the virus [9] [10] [11] . The cancellation or deferral of elective surgeries has created a backlog of surgery patients. An estimated 28,000 procedures were canceled or postponed during the peak 12 weeks of the pandemic [12] . There is no consensus on how nonemergency procedures should proceed and under what circumstances. The uncertainty of the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic implies that patients may be deprived of timely surgical care. Deferral of surgical procedures is a temporary measure, and a more long-term plan is needed to reintroduce elective surgery with the challenge of minimizing the risk of patients and the surgical staff contracting the infection while providing patients with the required surgical care [13] . Therefore, a proper framework is needed to prioritize surgical patients keeping in mind their COVID-19 status, the urgency of the procedure, risk of possible infection, and the risk of deferring the procedure. The COVID-19 testing algorithm was established by a tertiary care hospital to ensure the safe and effective management of surgical patients during the COVID-19",

Elective surgeries were postponed/deferred due to an increase in COVID-19 cases in May according to our surgical management guidelines. Our management recommendations were consistent with those stated in the literature, in that elective operations should be deferred, and only urgent, life-saving procedures and oncologic surgeries should be performed that are associated with worse outcomes if delayed [2] . The number of elective surgeries performed increased in June and July 2020, despite the increasing number of COVID-19 cases. This can be attributed to the institution's adaptation to the challenges and the \"new normal\" of the pandemic. Further, by the time COVID-19 cases peaked, effective guidelines had been established to help ensure the safety of both the surgical patients and the surgical teams. Surgical intervention decisions must be subjected to strict ethical and clinical scrutiny during this period with limited resources [7] .",

Following the aforementioned algorithm, only 1.4% of the patients who underwent surgery were positive for COVID-19. The majority of these patients underwent emergency surgery, and a greater proportion belonged to the red code. Surgeries on COVID-19 patients were performed in negative pressure flow OR with full PPE (including N95 masks and face and eye shields). Such patients were then admitted to the CTDZ. Our surgical management algorithm followed the guidelines similar to those from high-volume facilities in high-income countries (HICs) that include patient triaging based on symptoms and disease; patient segregation based on COVID-19 status; PPE use based on the WHO recommendations; limiting aerosolizing procedures in the OR; use of negativepressure ORs for COVID-19-positive patients; use of negative-pressure intensive care units for postoperative patients (in case these patients develop COVID-19 infection); and immediate postoperative step-down areas [15] . The practice patterns reported in LMICs are similar to those recommended by HICs; however, three facilities in the Philippines reported having no negative-pressure OR, demonstrating the economic discrepancy [16] [17] [18] . In the absence of such facilities, in some studies, numerous directed airconditioning systems were used to divert airflow away from the OR [19] . When operating on COVID-19positive patients in LMICs, the emphasis needs to be placed on PPE use rather than the OR setting, unlike in HICs [17, 18, 20, 21] .",
