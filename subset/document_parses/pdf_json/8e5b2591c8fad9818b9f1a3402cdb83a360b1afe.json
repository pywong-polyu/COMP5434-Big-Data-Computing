            "text": "Pandemic viruses remain a global threat to health and economics but how they adapt to become pandemic remains poorly understood. Here we compare pandemic HIV-1(M) and non-pandemic HIV-(O) and HIV-2 strains finding that non-pandemic HIV replicate poorly in myeloid cell models due to activation of cGAS and TRIM5, and ensuing antiviral responses. We use phylogenetics and viral capsid structural biology to define specific differences between pandemic and non-pandemic HIV capsids and demonstrate that their genetic reversal in HIV-1(M) mutants causes TRIM5, cGAS and innate immune activation. We propose a model in which the parental lineage of pandemic HIV-1(M) has uniquely evolved a dynamic capsid that avoids activation of cGAS and TRIM5 to establish cloaked replication in myeloid cells. The unique adaptations of the pandemic virus lineage suggests a role in effective humanto-human transmissibility and highlight the importance of avoiding innate immune activation during pandemic human-to-human viral transmission.",

            "text": "Human immunodeficiency viruses (HIVs) have arisen through multiple independent transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses from non-human primates. However, among these zoonotic events, only that leading to the HIV-1 group M lineage has achieved pandemic human-to-human transmission, infecting >80 million individuals (D'Arc et al., 2015; Gao et al., 1999; Gao et al., 1992) . Other HIV lineages have led to lower numbers of detected infections: HIV-1(N) =<20, HIV-1(P)=2, HIV-2(F)=2 and HIV-2(C), (D), (E) (H)=1 each (Mourez et al., 2013; Plantier et al., 2009; Simon et al., 1998; Vallari et al., 2011) . HIV-1(O) has infected around 100,00 humans (Mourez et al., 2013; Vessiere et al., 2010) , while HIV-2(A) and (B) have collectively infected around 2 million individuals and have declined in number (De Cock et al., 1993; Gottlieb et al., 2008) . It is unclear whether special features of HIV-1(M) have facilitated pandemic spread. Previous work has suggested that chance events have impacted development of the HIV pandemic (Faria et al., 2014) and a central role for HIV-1(M) Vpu adaptation to antagonise human tetherin has been proposed (Gupta and Towers, 2009; Sauter et al., 2009) . Further, the cytoplasmic sensor cyclic GMP-AMP synthase (cGAS) has been shown to inhibit HIV-2 infectivity with a role for the nuclear protein Non-POU domaincontaining octamer-binding protein (NONO) targeting the HIV-2 capsid (Lahaye et al., 2018) . We hypothesised that specific HIV-1(M) adaptation in capsid might favour human-to-human transmission through evasion of innate immune sensing. The HIV core accommodates and regulates reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome into DNA (Jacques et al., 2016) , initiated in the cytoplasm and completed in the nucleus (Burdick et al., 2020) . Current models suggest that if exposed in the cytoplasm, lentiviral DNA can be recognised by cGAS (Gao et al., 2013; Lahaye et al., 2013) , which when stimulated, synthesises cyclic guanosine monophosphate-adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), which activates stimulator of interferon genes (STING) to recruit tank binding kinase 1 (TBK1), leading to phosphorylation and nuclear import of transcription factor (interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Ablasser et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2019) . IRF3 induces type-I interferon (IFN) expression and subsequent expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). The capsid itself can also act as a pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) recognised by the restriction factor tripartite motif protein 5 (TRIM5) (Pertel et al., 2011) .",

However, species variants of TRIM5, for example the rhesus macaque TRIM5, forms a restrictive cage around HIV-1(M) cores, inhibiting viral uncoating and nuclear entry (Ganser-Pornillos et al., 2011; Skorupka et al., 2019; Stremlau et al., 2004) . Coordination of TRIM5 trimers at the vertices of the hexameric TRIM5 cage, also drives TRIM5 mediated K63 linked ubiquitin (Ub) chain synthesis, activation of TGFb activated kinase 1 (TAK1) and subsequently AP-1 and NF-kB transcription factors (Fletcher et al., 2015; Fletcher et al., 2018; Pertel et al., 2011) . Both cGAS and TRIM5 drive pro-inflammatory signalling responses expected to supress viral replication (Gao et al., 2013; Pertel et al., 2011) . We hypothesised that pandemic HIV-1(M) should be particularly effective in avoiding sensing because early inflammatory responses, and interferon production, are expected to limit lentiviral transmission (Sandler et al., 2014) . Here, we demonstrate that distinct pro-inflammatory profiles are induced following activation of cGAS (CXCL10, IFIT1, CCL5, MxA, IFIT2) and TRIM5 (IL8, IL1\u03b2, PTGS2, SOD2) by non-pandemic HIV-2 and HIV-1(O), but not pandemic HIV-1(M). We demonstrate unique structural adaptations in HIV-1(M) capsid that link to cGAS and TRIM5 insensitivity and propose that non-pandemic HIV strains lack the evolutionary adaptations required for effective innate immune evasion, limiting their human-to-human transmission and pandemic potential.",

We obtained commercial CRISPR/Cas9 ablated cGAS knock out THP-1 lines (Invivogen) and used them to show that cGAS knock out abrogated cGAS-sensitive IFIT1 and IFIT2 induction, but did not particularly impact induction of TRIM5-sensitive IL-8 and PTGS2 ( Figure 2F dark blue bars). By contrast, siRNA mediated depletion of TRIM5 in THP-1 ( Figure S2A ) reduced TRIM5-sensitive IL-8 and PTGS2 induction, but had little effect on cGAS-sensitive IFIT1 and IFIT2 expression ( Figure   2F , grey bars). Importantly, depleting TRIM5 with siRNA in the cGAS KO line ( Figure S2A ) reduced induction of all genes ( Figure 2F , light blue bars). Knockout of RNA sensing adaptor MAVS had no impact on innate immune activation by HIV-2/HIV-1 (O) ( Figure S2B -E). These data suggest that cGAS and TRIM5 independently contribute to the inflammatory innate immune response to non-pandemic lentivirus infection in macrophages.",

Depletion of cytoplasmic nuclease TREX1 has been shown to cause HIV-1(M) DNA to activate cGAS (Towers and Noursadeghi, 2014; Yan et al., 2010) , suggesting that DNA released from prematurely uncoating viral particles can trigger cGAS, if not degraded by TREX1. We therefore tested whether TREX1 over-expression in THP-1 cells could degrade the cGAS-activating viral DNA from non-pandemic viruses and suppress sensing. In fact, 20-fold TREX1 mRNA overexpression ( Figure S3A ), reduced ISG induction by HIV-2 and HIV-1(O), consistent with exposure of viral DNA activating innate immune response against both non-pandemic HIV ( Figure 3A , B). Unexpectedly, TREX1 overexpression also reduced HIV-2 infectivity, with no effect on HIV-1(M) ( Figure 3C ) suggesting that HIV-2 capsids do not effectively shield viral DNA from high TREX1 levels. In contrast, HIV-1(O) infection was not impacted by TREX1 over-expression ( Figure 3D ), despite cGAS activation (Figure 1 , 2B, D). This suggests that TREX1 sensitive HIV-2 is infectious and that HIV-2 and HIV-1(O) are different in their uncoating strategies, perhaps regarding timing and location, leading to different levels of TREX1 sensitivity and cGAS activation.",

            "text": "To assess the contribution of TRIM5 capsid-sensing to host gene induction we used VSV-G pseudotyped viral-like particles (VLP), produced without genomes. As expected, genome-free VLP induced TRIM5-sensitive IL-8, IL-1\u03b2, PTGS2, but not cGAS-sensitive IFIT1/IFIT2 in THP-1 ( Figure 4A ). To test whether TRIM5 activation induced an antiviral state, we activated TRIM5 in THP-1 using increasing doses of genome free VLP, and then infected the same cells 24h later. As a control for innate activation, we observed dose dependent activation of TRIM5 sensitive NF-kB reporter by HIV-2 and HIV-(O) VLPs, but very little activation by HIV-1(M) VLPs ( Figure S4A ). Importantly, responses to non-pandemic VLP inhibited a second infection by HIV-2 or HIV-1(O)-GFP ( Figure 4B ). Consistent with the failure of HIV-1(M) to activate gene expression, HIV-1(M) VLPs did not induce inhibition of HIV-2 or HIV-1(O)-GFP infection ( Figure 4B) . Surprisingly, HIV-1(M) was also insensitive to the effects of prior exposure to HIV-2 or HIV-1(O) VLPs ( Figure 4B ). Thus, TRIM5 activation induces the expression of antiviral genes, including secretion of IL-1\u03b2 ( Figure S4B ) that can restrict non-pandemic HIV. Concordantly, pre-treatment of THP-1 with IL-1\u03b2, or IFN-b, reduced infection of pandemic and non-pandemic HIV strains, but pandemic HIV-1(M) were notably less sensitive to IFN-b, and insensitive to IL-1\u03b2 even when the target cells were pretreated ( Figure S4C, D) . Importantly, single round infections with all viruses were much less sensitive to IL-1\u03b2 and IFN treatment when added, for example, 6 hours post-infection ( Figure S4D ). This is consistent with a model in which single round infections induce cytokines too late to inhibit that first round of infection. This is also evidenced by modest rescue of single round infection (GFP expression) of HIV-2 and HIV-1(O) when TRIM5 is depleted in macrophages ( Figure S4E ). We propose that sensor activation initiates a response that has stronger effects on later rounds of infection, as evidenced by the inhibition of infection when cells are pre-treated with IFN or IL-1\u03b2 ( Figure S4D ) .",

Indeed, an important role for capsid in determining interferon induction in macrophages was confirmed by our observation that HIV-1(M) chimeras bearing HIV-1(O) or HIV-2 CA could only replicate in MDM in the presence of IFNAR1-Ab, ( Figure   5A ). Thus the chimeric viruses bearing HIV-1(O) or HIV-2 capsid proteins behaved similarly to wild type (WT) HIV-2/HIV-1(O) in these cells ( Figure 1A -C). Importantly, the chimeric viruses replicated efficiently in GHOST cells indicating replication fitness ( Figure S5A ). Previously reported X-ray structures of HIV-1(M) CA hexamers suggest that they can crystalise in two distinct conformations, with respect to a channel at the 6-fold symmetry axis. The position adopted by the beta hairpin structure (BHP) above the channel can be open (His12 forms a salt bridge with Asp51) or closed (in which there is a bridging water molecule between His 12 and Asp 51) ( Figure 5B ) (Jacques et al., 2016) . Within the channel, six arginines (R18) form a positively charged centre suggesting a model in which nucleotides are electrostatically recruited into HIV cores to fuel encapsidated DNA synthesis (Jacques et al., 2016; Xu et al., 2020) . We proposed that this mechanism is conserved in HIV-1(O) and HIV-2 because they conserve Arg at the equivalent positions at the 6-fold symmetry axis (Jacques et al., 2016) . Furthermore, like HIV-1(M), purified recombinant HIV-1(O) hexamer can bind dCTP at nanomolar Kd measured by fluorescence anisotropy ( Figure S5B ).",

In this analysis the same phylogenetic tree is coloured according to the amino acid present at each position in the alignment. The coloured tree for CA position 50 ( Figure   5C ) stood out because the amino acid at this position defines the pandemic lineage, with HIV-1(M) and its chimpanzee parent (SIVcpzPtt), uniquely bearing glutamine (Q) at CA50. SIV from Red Capped Mangabeys (SIVrcm), the parent providing capsid to SIVcpzPtt (Bailes et al., 2003) , SIVgor and HIV-1(O) all bear tyrosine (Y) at CA position 50.

Comparison of HIV-1(M) and HIV-1(O) hexamer structures explain the importance of position 50, which is located in the BHP hinge region (compare Figure 5B to 5E). In the HIV-1(M) hexamer, residue Q50, contributes to the tetrahedral hydrogen bonding network that promotes the closed BHP position. This is also true in the SIVcpzPtt capsid that is parental to the pandemic HIV-1(M). An SIVcpzPtt hexamer structure revealed that like HIV-1(M), Q50 contributes to the closed BHP position by coordinating a water molecule ( Figure 5D ). However, in HIV-1(O) Y50 has been retained from the ancestral SIVgor, preventing water coordination and BHP closure ( Figure 5E ). All known HIV-2 and SIVsmm CA sequences bear tyrosine at this position consistent with a conserved structural difference to pandemic HIV-1 ( Figure 5C ). We have been unable to crystalise the HIV-2 Figure S5D ). Importantly, and unlike other capsid point mutants for example CA K25A which prevents IP6 recruitment into assembling virions (Renner et al., 2021) , HIV-1 (M) Q50Y capsids were not intrinsically destabilised, showing wild type disassembly kinetics in the absence of IP6 in single molecule uncoating assays ( Figure 5I and S5E) (Marquez et al., 2018) . As expected, given the similar structure, addition of IP6 led to an increase of the HIV-1(M) Q50Y capsid half life from minutes to hours for the majority of capsids, confirming that IP6 binding was not perturbed. Nevertheless, in infection experiments, single round infectivity of HIV-1(M) GFP CA Q50Y in MDM was poor and this capsid mutant did not replicate ( Figure S5F ).",

This revealed a patch of differences around CA position 120, identified as a deletion of Arginine CA 120 in HIV-1(M) and its SIVcpzPtt parent ( Figure   6A ). Inspection of the non-pandemic hexamer structures revealed that the arginine lost from SIVcpzPtt/HIV-1(M) forms a salt bridge between helix six and the CypA binding loop in HIV-1(O) and HIV-2 CA helix 6: Arg 120-Glu 98 in HIV-1(O), Arg 118-Glu 96 in HIV-2 ( Figure 6B ). This salt bridge is also conserved in the SIVmac hexamer, between Arg 117 and Glu 95, but not in the SIVcpzPtt structure ( Figure 6B ). These observations suggest that, in addition to Y50Q, the SIVcpzPtt parent of the pandemic HIV-1(M) lineage lost a salt bridge on the CA surface through loss of an arginine residue. To examine its phenotypic effect, we reversed the deletion in HIV-1(M), restoring the arginine in mutant HIV-1(M)+R120. The X-ray structure of this HIV-1(M) CA +R120 hexamer mutant revealed that adding the arginine reinstated the salt bridge ( Figure 6B ) and this restored the infectivity of VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1(M) CA Q50Y+R120 in MDM ( Figure 6C )",

To test this, we reversed the pandemic-associated CA mutations in HIV-1(M) and infected MDM. We found that HIV-1(M) CA Q50Y+R120 could only replicate in MDM in the presence of IFNAR1-Ab, consistent with enhanced sensing and innate immune activation ( Figure 7A ). Concordantly, VSV-G pseudotyped HIV-1(M) CA Q50Y+R120, induced cGAS and TRIM5 sensitive genes in MDM more strongly than WT HIV-1(M), ( Figure S6A Figure 7D ). HIV-1(M) CA Q50Y+R120 VLPs without genome, induced TRIM5-sensitive, but not cGAS-sensitive, genes in THP-1 ( Figure 7E ). MAVS depletion had no effect on innate immune responses elicited by HIV-1(M) CA Q50Y+R120 infection ( Figure S6C , D). Finally, we found that HIV-1(M) CA Q50Y+R120 behaved like non-pandemic viruses HIV-1(O) and HIV-2, in that it was more sensitive to restriction by human TRIM5 than wild type HIV-1(M), evidenced by rescue of infection by TRIM5 depletion in U87 cells, using stable shRNA expression ( Figure S6E ). Infection with TRIM5 sensitive MLV-N and insensitive MLV-B acted as controls (Keckesova et al., 2006) . Thus, an HIV-1(M) CA mutation bearing Q50Y+R120, to represent non-pandemic HIV lineages, behaved like non-pandemic HIV, activating innate immune gene expression in a TRIM5 and cGAS sensitive way. These observations outline how key amino acid changes in HIV-1(M) led to structural changes in the capsid that correspond with reduced activation of, or restriction by, key lentiviral sensors, cGAS and TRIM5. We therefore propose that the SIVcpzPtt/HIV-1(M) lineage has undergone complex adaptations that underlie its pandemic success and that this study provides mechanistic insight into how particular pandemic lineage-specific adaptations at capsid positions 50 and 120 have paved the way for this particular SIVcpzPtt lineage to become pandemic in humans as HIV-1(M).",

Accumulating data highlight the importance of HIV capsid in regulating viral DNA synthesis and shielding viral DNA from cytosolic sensors. Indeed, recent study of fluorescently labeled HIV-1 particles has shown that HIV-1(M) capsids remains intact during travel across the cytoplasm and through the nuclear pore complex, uncoating shortly before integration in the nucleus (Bejarano et al., 2019; Burdick et al., 2020; Li et al., 2021; Muller et al., 2021; Zila et al., 2021) . Thus DNA synthesis takes place inside intact cores, during cytoplasmic transport, possibly completing in the nucleus, consistent with a key protective function for capsid against nucleases and innate immune sensors. Here, we have discovered that the SIVcpzPtt parent of pandemic HIV-1(M) evolved specific adaptations in capsid that improve evasion of human innate immune sensors cGAS and TRIM5, as compared to non-pandemic strains derived from independent zoonoses.",

We note that TRIM5 depletion rescued single round infection of sensitive viruses in MDM ( Figure S4E ) to a similar degree as IFN receptor blockade ( Figure S1A ). TRIM5 depletion also suppressed macrophage activation of gene expression by non-pandemic HIV-2 and HIV-1(O) infection. These data suggest important roles for both innate immune signaling, and physical caging of incoming capsids, for TRIM5 antiviral activity (Li et al., 2016) . TRIM5 signaling is driven by TRIM5 RING trimerisation at the vertices of the hexameric TRIM5 lattice that forms on viral cores (Fletcher et al., 2015; Fletcher et al., 2018) and HIV-1(M) appears to escape sensitivity to human TRIM5 in part through CypA recruitment (Kim et al., 2019) . It is also possible that capsid surface dynamics influence TRIM5 recruitment and therefore the gain or loss of the salt bridge on the capsid surface also impacts TRIM5 restriction and activation of TRIM5 signaling. A complete understanding of TRIM5 sensitivity determinants awaits atomic level structural definition of lentiviral capsid-TRIM5 interactions (Li et al., 2016; Skorupka et al., 2019) . We hypothesise that capsid influences cGAS sensitivity indirectly, through regulating the timing and position of uncoating and genome release, and therefore exposure of viral DNA PAMP to cGAS. This model is supported by our observation that over-expression of TREX1 suppresses innate immune activation by both HIV-1(O) and HIV-2 and inhibits infectivity of HIV-2 suggesting that partially uncoated, and therefore TREX1 sensitive, HIV-2 cores are infectious ( Figure 3 ).",

            "text": "Our study focuses on the phenotypes of a small number of non-pandemic HIV lineages, but our phylogenetic analyses suggest significant complexity in HIV capsid evolution. For example, it is striking that the SIVcpzPtt lineage gave rise to both pandemic HIV-1(M), which retained Q50, and non-pandemic HIV-1(N), which only infected a small number of people, but completely replaced Q50 with S, A or G, each requiring multiple nucleotide changes ( Figure 5 ). On the other hand, Y50 is retained in SIVsmm to HIV-2 and chimpanzee-to-gorilla and gorilla-to-human HIV-1(O) zoonoses ( Figure 5 ). Furthermore, the SIVcpzPtt progenitor also gave rise to viruses retaining the ancestral tyrosine at CA50 (SIVgor, HIV-1(O)) suggesting an unsampled lineage of SIVcpzPtt that kept this amino acid. While we cannot be sure of the pressures that selected capsid adaptations, we hypothesise that complexity arises from the diversity of capsid function and the species-specific cofactor interactions that govern regulation of DNA synthesis, uncoating and nuclear entry which frequently, but not always require adaptation of the hexamer channel. Certainly there is more to pandemic adaptation than changes at capsid positions 50 and 120, because we were unable to enhance HIV-2/HIV-1(O) replication in human MDM by mutating CA Y50Q, which significantly reduced infectivity of both HIV-1(O) and HIV-2 (data not shown). (Chauveau et al., 2015; Dittmar et al., 1999; Mack et al., 2017) . Here we focused on primary human macrophage replication because primary T-cells are not permissive to HIV replication unless activated, typically by cross-linking the T-cell receptor (TCR) to mimic antigen stimulation. Thus, TCR-dependent signalling and cytokine secretion dominate in vitro HIV infection experiments, obviating experimental interpretation of virus-induced changes such as activation of cGAS/TRIM5",

These observations highlight how the regulation of IFN and IL-1\u03b2 over the course of a viral infection (Gondim et al., 2021) and how cytokine responses interact and influence each other to promote an antiviral state is still not well understood. Nontheless, together with our data, these observations emphasise the importance of innate immune evasion as a key determinant of transmission and therefore pandemic potential. We note that the changes that allow evasion of innate sensing occurred in viruses infecting central chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) prior to transmission to humans, suggesting that SIVcpzPtt are more dangerous to humans than SIVcpzPts strains infecting eastern chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii), which have never been detected in the human population.",

Diffraction data were collected from a single crystal at the PETRA III P13 beamline (EMBL-Hamburg/DESY P13, Germany). The data set was indexed, processed, and scaled using the XDS package (Kabsch, 2010) . The HIV-1 (M) CA R120 crystal belonged to the P 6 space group with a solvent content of 48.5% corresponding to one molecule per asymmetric unit. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using Phenix Phaser (Adams et al., 2010) and a previously determined HIV-1 (M) CA structure (PDB ID:4XFX) as search model. Model building was performed using COOT (Emsley et al., 2010) . Refinement was performed using REFMAC 5.8.

However, comparison of the HIV-1(O) hexamer hinge region with the hinge region of the published HIV-2 CA N-terminal domain structure (PDB ID 2X82) (Ylinen et al., 2010) and a modelled HIV-2 hexamer, illustrates the resemblance between these non-pandemic capsids, and suggests an open BHP position for HIV-2 due to the similarity in the region around Y49 in HIV-2 and Y50 in HIV-1(O) (Figure 5E, G). We were able to solve the structure of an SIVmac hexamer (Figure 5F). SIV from macaques (SIVmac) was unknowingly transmitted during laboratory experiments from Sooty Mangabeys infected with SIV Sooty Mangabey (SIVsmm) to Rhesus Macaques in captivity and is closely related to the parental SIVsmm virus (Figure 5C)(Apetrei et al., 2005). SIVmac hexamer retained the open BHP conformation and the structure of the BHP hinge region including the position Y50, which is highly conserved between HIV-1(O), HIV-2 and SIVmac further illustrating the structural similarity between hexamers from viruses bearing tyrosine at CA position 50 despite the HIV-1(O) and SIVsmm lineages being highly divergent (Figure 5E-G). To probe the role of CA50 in HIV-1 infectivity we made HIV-1(M) CA Q50Y, reverting the glutamine at position 50 to the ancestral tyrosine. Solving the mutant hexamer structure confirmed that the BHP of HIV-1(M) CA Q50Y adopted an open conformation and the hinge region of the HIV-1(M) Q50Y mutant resembled the HIV-1(O) and SIVmac structures (Figure 5H). Indeed, overlay of the open WT HIV-1(M) hexamer structure (PDB ID: 5HGL) and HIV-1(M) CA Q50Y (PDB ID:7T13) demonstrated the similarity between them (",
