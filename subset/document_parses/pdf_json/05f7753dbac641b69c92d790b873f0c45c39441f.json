            "text": "To the Editor-The ongoing coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), started in December 2019 as a large viral pneumonia outbreak in the city of Wuhan, China. 1 The disease spread from Wuhan to other countries, and the World Health Organization declared it a pandemic by March 11, 2020 (https://www.who. int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-theyhappen). With vaccine development currently underway, the rapid identification of disease carriers and their close contacts represents the only effective measure to limit SARS-CoV-2 spreading. 2 Hospitals are hotbeds for SARS-CoV-2 transmission; healthcare workers (HCWs) are at high risk of being infected and of further transmitting the virus to vulnerable patients. 3 Thus, infection control strategies based on SARS-CoV-2 testing in HCWs and patients are necessary. 4 Unfortunately, this type of disease surveillance is limited by the overwhelming demand for SARS-CoV-2 molecular diagnostic analyses. 3, 5, 6 To increase COVID-19 testing capacity, procedures based on pooling of naso-oral pharyngeal (NOP) swab specimens have been recently proposed. [7] [8] [9] However, the validation of the sample pooling approach is crucial to assess its diagnostic accuracy and to avoid false-negative results. Recent studies describing the detection of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in pools of 5 to 32 samples reported falsenegative rates up to 10% for large groups, suggesting that smaller sample pools are a good compromise to increase sample processing capacity while maintaining test reliability. [6] [7] [8] [9] Since 5-sample pools were shown to efficiently detect SARS-CoV-2 RNA in RT-PCR assays, 7 we chose to test and validate this approach using a highthroughput RNA extraction and amplification platform. The Sant' Andrea Hospital of Rome (Italy) has put in place a SARS-CoV-2 surveillance program focused on the periodic screening of HCWs and preventive screening of patients (before hospitalization). In total, 2,035 people from the surveillance program (1,437 HCWs and 598 patients) were enrolled in this study. The molecular diagnostic workflow we used for SARS-CoV-2 detection included the following elements: (1) NOP swab sampling using the COPAN UTM-RM virus transport medium (Copan Diagnostics, Murrieta, CA); (2) automated specimen RNA extraction and amplification with the Versant kPCR molecular system (Siemens Healthineers AG, Erlangen, Germany). Viral nucleic acid detection was carried out using the detection kit for 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) RNA (PCR-fluorescence probing; Daan Gene, Sun Yat University, Guangzhou, Guandong, China), an RT-PCR assay which simultaneously detects the viral nucleocapsid (N) and",

The Ct value differences (\u0394Ct) between individual and pooled positive samples ranged from 0.3 to 2.3 for N and from 0.4 to 1.8 for Orf1ab (Fig. 1) .

In conclusion, the described approach represents an optimal strategy for surveillance programs in late pandemic phases when screening of a large population is needed. ",
