In addition to the common presenting symptoms of fever, fatigue, and mild respiratory symptoms like dry cough, patients with COVID-19 can also develop neurological manifestations like headache, anosmia, hyposmia, dysgeusia, meningitis, encephalitis, and acute cerebrovascular accidents during the course of the disease (3, 4) . The first case of meningitis associated with COVID-19 was reported in Japan in February 2020 (5) . Since then, two or three more cases of meningoencephalitis have also been reported in the United States (6) (7) (8) . Although very rare, these neurological manifestations sometimes are the sole initial presenting complaint of COVID-19. In this article, we present a case discussion of instances in which the initial presenting symptoms were exclusive to meningitis and later diagnosed as COVID-19, to make physicians and healthcare workers cognizant of such rare presentations. It is important to diagnose and manage these patients at the earliest possible stage of treatment to prevent the horizontal spread of COVID-19.",

Based on these X-ray findings, testing for COVID-19 was done and a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 on nasopharyngeal swab was positive on day 5 of hospitalization. On that same day, he developed tachycardia, tachypnea, and hypotension; his oxygen saturation started to drop progressively and was put on a ventilator. His chest X-ray showed diffuse multi-lobar infiltrates consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (Figure 1) . His laboratory work up showed respiratory acidosis and a picture of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) ( Table 3) . One day later, he passed away due to multi-organ failure. ",

Cytokine storm syndrome related damage to the central nervous system has also been implicated in many other viral infections (11) . However, only five RBCs in the CSF of our patient could be attributed to traumatic lumbar puncture. Likewise, it has also been suggested that cytokine storm syndrome causes severe symptoms and brain damage in patients with COVID-19 and this is supported by the fact that patients having severe symptoms associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection respond to interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor blocker [i.e., tocilizumab (12) ]. Together with typical picture of viral meningitis on CSF analysis, negative polymerase chain reaction for herpes simplex, and positive reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction for SARS-CoV-2 on a nasopharyngeal swab, we labeled this case of meningitis as viral meningitis secondary to SARS-CoV-2. Although there have been some cases reported of SARS-CoV-2 detection in CSF by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (5, 13 ), yet US Food and Drug Administration has not approved any test to detect SARS-CoV-2 in CSF. Additionally, as the CT head was normal in this case, we should have ordered a magnetic resonance imaging of the brain for detailed imaging.",
