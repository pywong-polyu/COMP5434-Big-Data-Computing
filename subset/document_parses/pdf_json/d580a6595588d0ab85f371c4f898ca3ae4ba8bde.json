This may reflect the heightened anxiety associated with COVID as well as generalized delays in clinic follow up during the COVID pandemic. Pre-pandemic, many glaucoma units were already managing a backlog of outpatients, associated with heightened anxiety around aspects of glaucoma care [4] . The POEM questionnaire highlights that this situation has been exacerbated by COVID. Further studies investigating delays in patient appointments with impacts on visual acuity deterioration as well as true glaucomatous progression will further elucidate the psychological and physiological impacts that COVID has had. Fig. 2 Patient responses identifying if COVID had caused increased concern based on each item of the POEM Questionnaire. Domains pertaining to safety (Q7) and organizational aspects (Q8) of glaucoma treatment (both related to the perception by the patient of the treatment team) were the areas which patients explicitly identified as areas of concern due to COVID. This correlated with the results from graphs in Fig. 1 when comparing pre-COVID and post-COVID POEM results.",
