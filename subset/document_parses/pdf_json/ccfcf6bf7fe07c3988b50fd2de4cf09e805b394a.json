To decrease the general inflow of patients to hospitals, recommendations have been provided to reduce the number of medical and surgical procedures ensuring that only urgent and non-deferrable oncological surgeries are performed. On February 28th, the president of the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) suggested to defer all non-urgent surgeries (6). Similarly, in most of European National Health Systems a reduction of surgical activity was recommended. Several definitions of deferrable and non-deferrable procedures have been proposed. In particular, the EAU guidelines categorized procedures into priority groups (Table-1): 1) emergency, life-threatening situations that cannot be postponed for more than 24 hours; 2) high priority, the last to postpone because of the concrete possibility of a clinical harm; 3) intermediate, should be cancelled but recommended not to postpone for more than 3 months. Clinical harm (progression, metastasis, loss of organ function) is possible if postponed 3-4 months but unlikely and; 4) low priority, that can be postponed for more than 6 months (7). Stensland et al. (8) defined a list of urological conditions and surgical procedures that patients may undergo during the pandemic, stressing a more conservative approach whenever feasible. For example, benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and urinary tract stones should be treated only if complication occurs, with catheterization, and nephrostomy or ureteral stenting, respectively. Surgery should be maintained just for urological urgencies, such as testicular torsion, refractory gross hematuria and oncological disease (i.e. invasive muscle bladder cancer, suspected high grade T1 bladder cancer, kidney tumors >cT3) ( Table-2 ). The Research Urology Network (RUN) group has outlined priorities for urological patients ( Table- 3), providing strategies for the management of urological patients not suspected of, or positive for COVID-19 (4) . Treatments that ensure a fast discharge with the resolution of functional harms should be used. For instance, in",

In cases of gross hematuria, surgery should be limited to cystoscopy for clot evacuation and concomitant hemostasis, preferably in an outpatient setting. However, bladder tumors should be removed if identified. The aim of these conservative approaches is to limit the need for blood transfusions and post-operative intensive care bed occupation. Considering the limited resources, urgent and emergent urological conditions are suggested to be treated under local or regional anesthesia whenever feasible to reduce aerosol generation (4). The RUN group divided uro-oncological procedures into four categories: non-deferrable; semi-non-deferrable; deferrable; and replaceable with other treatments. Non-deferrable surgeries include muscle-invasive or high-risk progression bladder cancer, testicular cancer, renal tumor >T2, upper urinary tract cancer \u2265cT1, high-risk prostate cancer unsuitable for radiation therapy (RT), and penile cancer >cT1G3 (4). For these pathologies, a delay could result in poorer cancer-related outcomes. If a hospital struggles with limited resources due to an uncontrolled COVID-19 spread, the patient should be transferred to a lower impact area for treatment. High-complexity surgery carries higher rates of morbidity and mortality and, in cases where patient's health is not jeopardized, it should be delayed (9) . For selected patients not fit for major surgery, conservative approaches such as bladder-sparing treatments, may provide comparable oncological outcomes without affecting patients' comorbidities and safety (10) . However, it has to be considered that the delay of surgical treatment of non-emergent oncological cases could lead to poorer standard oncological outcomes, affecting survival (11) . In COVID-19 positive patients, non--emergent procedures should be postponed, while urgent surgeries have to be performed in a separated and dedicated operating theatre, following local institution recommendations for protection of the operating staff (11) . Finally, all interventions for benign uncomplicated disease should be deferred until the end of the pandemic (4).",

Accordingly, triage should be organized in hierarchic parts.

If there are no suggestions of a possible COVID-19 infection, the patient can be accepted to the hospital for the second phase of triage. At this stage, the patient is asked to wear a surgical mask, protective gloves and to follow all the recommended hygiene rules. The patient will then undergo thermoscan for the evaluation of the body temperature and all pre--hospitalization tests will be performed including chest x-ray and pharyngeal swab for COVID-19. Since most of the elective procedures are performed for malignant pathology it will be important, as far as staging is concerned, to strictly follow the guidelines thus avoiding non-essential tests, a valid aid to maintain the safety distance between patients. Simonato et al. proposed reducing the number of beds per room and/or to ensure the minimum safety distance between beds (15).",

Research protocols and experimental treatments have to be avoided and surgeries must be performed by skilled surgeons according to the standard approach in order to reduce operative time, post-operative complications and to spare resources. Any kind of surgery may increase the transmission risk of respiratory tract infections that could induce life-threatening outcomes, in case COVID-19 diagnosis is missed (19) . For this reason, during intubation and extubating, the surgical team should wait outside the operating room, and all intubation maneuvers should be performed in negative-pressure operating theatre wearing appropriate PPE (20) . Operative rooms usually have positive pressure technology in their aseptic zone (operating area) and are separated only by doors. These sliding barriers imply that the laminar air flow will be disrupted once doors are opened letting particles and aerosols to circulate freely. That is why it has been recommended to set up operating rooms at negative pressure to reduce COVID-19 dissemination beyond the theatre. The more people in the operating room, the more air-turbulences could worsen, regardless of the positive or negative pressure system (21) . Therefore, there is the need to reduce the surgical team number to the minimum. Urologists were, and are pioneers of minimally invasive surgery (MIS): from endoscopy to robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. MIS has been shown to reduce post-operative complications and peri-operative blood transfusions when compared to the open approach (22), supporting the need to limit the use of blood derivatives due to the decrease in blood donation. In order to spare resources, MIS should be performed where possible, by experienced surgeons outside of their learning curve (4) .",

Avoiding the use of two-way pneumoperitoneum insufflators is suggested to prevent the colonization of circulating aerosol in the insufflator or pneumoperitoneum circuit (24) .

Gas has a low mobility in the pneumoperitoneum, and this leads to an accumulation of aerosol formed during procedure in the abdominal cavity. A sudden release of trocar valves, larger skin incisions or incorrect trocar removal before the complete disinflation can expose the theatre staff to potentially infected pneumoperitoneum aerosol (23) . Thus, operating room staff must confirm the complete and correct disinflation of the pneumoperitoneum at the end of every procedure. Otherwise, the proven benefits of MISs in terms of reduced post-operative complications and length of stay, as well as the advantages of ultrafiltration of most or all aerosol particles, must be strongly considered.

The CO-VID-19 pandemic will have a profound effect on surgical education for the foreseeable future. The Centers for Disease Control and prevention recently recommended avoiding any gatherings with more than 10 people (34) . As a result, face to face academic activities, including teaching conferences and simulation labs should be avoided. The rotations between different institutions and abroad fellowships have been limited or cancelled, as rotating through different hospitals may significantly increase the risk of contagion for residents, patients, and other healthcare personnel. In addition, national and international urological conferences, such as the EAU and the American Urology Association (AUA) congresses have been postponed, cancelled or converted to a telematic format (35). The EAU guidelines, the American College of Surgeons (ACS), and even many government institutions, are suggesting to cancel elective surgery (7, 36) and most facilities are minimizing participants in any operation to essential personnel only.

Furthermore, the debate on the participation of trainees in clinical activity during the COVID-19 outbreak is still open. In some countries, tutors and educators suggest residents to stay home and step down if they are not required for any clinical or ward duties (38) . Many residency programs have responded to the pandemic by assembling rotating teams to cover their urology services, reducing the risk of CO-VID-19 exposure to patients and residents alike (39) . These factors will undoubtedly decrease resident case volume and will impact strongly on every aspects of their training. However, it is of note that health crisis could lead to an opportunity for trainees to improve skills not acquirable during the normal practice: how to manage urology patients during a pandemic.",

A problem that we will soon have to cope with is the accumulation of cases delayed during this pandemic and the consequent extent of surgical waiting lists.
