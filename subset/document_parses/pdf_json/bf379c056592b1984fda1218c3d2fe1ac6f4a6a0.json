Therefore, it is critical to not only quantify the concentration and particle size ranges of aerosols generated from different rhinologic procedures but also study the mitigating effects of available suction devices in reducing aerosols. There has been some recent confusion in the literature regarding the concept and definition of aerosols, so we believe that it is important to clarify the terminology. 12 Aerosols are defined as particles suspended in a gas that can contain a variety of pathogens, including viruses, and those particles with a diameter \\5.0 to 10.0 mm are known to be capable of short-and long-range transmission as well as penetration into the lower airway. 10 Airborne transmission of aerosols generally refers to transmission by particles \\10.0 mm, which is defined by the Infectious Diseases Society of America as ''respirable particles.'' 10,13 SARS-CoV-2 virions are measured to be 60 to 140 nm and as a result can be transported via aerosols, 14 and there are a number of cases reported that can be explained only by aerosol-based transmission. 8 However, the scientific community continues to debate how to classify aerosols and acknowledges that strict size criteria can be arbitrary and should be carefully interpreted according to the environmental condition. 10, 15 In addition, the risk of viral transmission posed by aerosols has not been quantified, and it remains unknown what particle concentrations and duration of exposure to classify as dangerous.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 708, "end": 710, "text": "12", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 983, "end": 985, "text": "10", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1274, "end": 1276, "text": "14", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1376, "end": 1377, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1595, "end": 1598, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1599, "end": 1601, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "With this context in mind, the findings from our cadaveric surgical simulation indicate that all of the studied rhinologic procedures-including both types of FESS (nonpowered instrumentation and microdebrider), powered drilling, use of an ultrasonic aspirator, and needle tip electrocauterygenerated a statistically significant increase in the number concentration of aerosols from 0.30 to 10.0 mm, predominantly in the submicroparticle range from 0.30 to 1.0 mm. This is a novel finding within the otolaryngology literature, as the previously published article on aerosol generation from endonasal procedures reported findings in the microparticle range of 1.0 to 10.0 mm. 16 In this study, the quantity of generated aerosols varied significantly among procedures, with powered drilling producing the greatest concentration and microdebrider FESS producing the least. The finding of high-speed endonasal powered drilling carrying the greatest risk of generating aerosols is consistent with that of Workman et al 16 ; however, our study found that the majority of aerosols generated by the drill were submicroparticles (\\1.0 mm). This simulation also differs in that we report aerosol production during FESS with and without a powered suction microdebrider. The majority of aerosols generated during cold FESS were 0.30 to 0.37 mm. In comparison, microdebrider FESS had much lower overall aerosol concentration for each particle size, likely secondary to active suctioning. Otherwise, our results showed significant aerosol generation from needle tip electrocautery, though we found that an ultrasonic aspirator generated even more aerosols. It is important to note that both studies used the same machine, though there was a difference in its positioning. In this simulation, the OPS 3330 was placed across from the surgeon, on the right side of the cadaver head, in an effort to more accurately represent the aerosol risk to the operating surgeon and surgical technologist.

This simulation tested 3 passive suction interventions that all significantly reduced aerosols in multiple size ranges for all the tested surgical conditions. Among these, the surgical smoke evacuation system appeared to be the most effective in mitigating aerosol generation, though a statistically significant difference was observed during cold FESS and electrocautery.

Although our experiment does show that different suction interventions can reduce aerosol concentrations generated during rhinologic surgery, we cannot say whether this translates into reduction of infectious transmission risk or make recommendations on the use of PPE, as the presence of bacterial or viral pathogens in the aerosol was not assessed. Furthermore, aerosols were measured at a single fixed point, across from the surgeon. Therefore, the generated aerosols measured during the various procedures may reflect exposure to only the surgeon and surgical technologist. Further studies should measure aerosol levels at the average distance of anesthesia and circulating staff. Moreover, aerosol generation during surgery on live patients may be different than a cadaver head for several potential reasons: normal physiologic temperature and blood flow, intranasal secretions, or disease conditions such as nasal polyposis.
