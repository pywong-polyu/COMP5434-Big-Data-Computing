There is growing concern that vaccine hesitancy and anti-vaccination presence will dampen the uptake of a coronavirus vaccine. There are many cited reasons for vaccine hesitancy. Mercury content, autism association, and vaccine danger have been commonly found in anti-vaccination messages. It is also mused that the reduced disease burden from infectious diseases has paradoxically reduced the perceived requirement for vaccine uptake. Our analysis using Google Trends has shown that throughout the pandemic the search interest in a coronavirus vaccine has increased and remained high throughout. Peaks are found when public declarations are made, the case number increases significantly, or when vaccine breakthroughs are announced. Anti-vaccine searches, in the context of COVID-19, have had a continued and growing presence during the pandemic. Contrary to what some may believe, the burden of coronavirus has not been enough to dissuade anti-vaccine searches entirely.",

It stands to reason that a greater public interaction and consumer friendly message base may aid this effort. Simply providing evidenced based rationale has been shown to be ineffective in addressing anti-vaccination group mindsets, with the Dunning-Kruger effect being cited as a reason for anti-vaccination discreditation of medical evidence [21] . One case study investigated a change in tact, whereby an online discussion board followed the layout of presenting appealing stories, facts, video links and emotive stories of the consequences of the communicable diseases prevented by vaccines [20] . Although this was a successful means of information dissemination, it should be noted that this pro-vaccine webpage would only likely attract pro-vaccine individuals.

This peak immediately follows the declaration by the World Health Organisation (WHO) of COVID-19's pandemic status on 11th March 2020. A second smaller surge in search interest on vaccines and COVID-19 occurs in early June, coinciding with the announcement by WHO to wear a mask in all public areas on 6th June 2020.
