Using convenient mechanical milling methods, nanocomposites with superior photocatalytic and catalytic properties are synthesized. Herein, we have adopted a green, eco-friendly, and economical route for the synthesis of Ag nanoparticles using Zingiber officinalae rhizome extract in an aqueous solution. The synthesized materials were characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, XRD, SEM & FE-SEM, FT-IR, Raman, and a particle size analyzer with zeta potential analysis. The photocatalytic activities of Ag, ZnO and their composites were studied by observing the degradation of methylene blue and crystal violet dyes under natural sunlight. Then the catalytic efficacies of synthesized nanoparticles for various organic transformation reactions were studied. Ag-ZnO nanocomposites were predicted to have improved photocatalytic activity and organic transformation reactions, allowing them to be used in environmental remediation applications.",

The first evidence of a link between human life and the nanoscale is probably can be found in Ayurveda, which is a 5000-year-old Indian system of medicine. Even before the term nanotechnology was invented, Ayurveda had some understanding of nanomedicine manufacturing and their effects (Prasad and Elumalai 2011; Prasad et al. 2021) . The creation of metallic nanoparticles (NPs) is well documented in the ancient Ayurvedic literature, Ras-Ratnakar (Nazeruddin et al. 2014) . Nanomaterials have features that are substantially distinct from bulk counterparts at the nanoscale, and they can be employed in solar cells, lithium ion batteries, bio-sensors, gas sensors, memristors, transistors, in smart textiles, veterinary medicines or as catalysts for chemical transformation reactions (Mahdieh et al. 2012) . Because metal NPs are biocompatible and employed in water purification, catalysis, and other applications, there has been a lot of interest in developing approaches for the controlled synthesis of metal NPs with well-defined shapes, sizes, and compositions (Khan et al. 2012) .",

One of the goals of employing plant extracts was to establish a quick synthesis of NPs that took only a few hours, as opposed to the traditional biosynthetic method involving microorganisms, which takes 2-4 days to completely reduce metal ions. Few medicinal plants are known to have antioxidant properties, which means they can operate as a biological supply of reducing agents. The properties of material at nanoscale depends upon their size and shape. The size and shape of the particles are influenced by various factors such as concentration of solution, pH, reaction temperature, nature of reducing agent and capping agents and time of contact. The considerable work in the domain of biogenic synthesis of transition metal nanomaterials were done by S. Shiv Shankar (Shankar et al. 2004 ). The manufacture of Ag and Au NPs using Azadirachata indica decoction solution was reported by S. Shiv Shankar et al. The NPs, are in the 50-100 nm range and are not well separated from one another (Shankar et al. 2004) .",

Biodiversity can thus be leveraged as a valuable resource for biotechnological products and processes, including large-scale production of NPs of various sizes and forms (Ahmad et al. 2010) . Herein, an attempt has been made for extra cellular bio-synthesis of transition metal NPs using ginger rhizome extracts. In a tropical country like India, Zingiber officinale, which belongs to the Zingiberaceae family, is a widely available herb that is extensively utilized in Indian cuisine. It's been used for centuries to cure bronchitis, carminative, hypertension, migraines, and other diseases. Apart from this during the recent pandemic situation of Covid-19, ginger was highly recommended from Ayurvedic doctors. This plant's rhizome extract is known to have diuretic qualities and is used as a cleaner and analgesic agent in ear drops. In comparison to aspirin, this plant is also used to enhance appetite and cure asthma, and it is thought to be a possible anti-platelet agent. It has anti-inflammatory and analgesic qualities similar to non-steroid anti-inflammatory medications, but without the gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcer development adverse effects (Pawar et al. 2015) . The rhizome extract of Zingiber officinale is utilized here as a reducing and stabilizing agent. As a result, this process is both environmentally friendly and cost-effective when compared to other methods of synthesis. Protein in the aqueous extract could function as a bio-ligand. This approach synthesized NPs that were well dispersed and showed no signs of aggregation.",

As a result, the plant rhizome extract can act as a reducing agent and a capping agent, preventing the NPs from agglomeration (Yeh et al. 2014) . The synthesis of Ag NPs is the result of the reduction of Ag + ions, which is followed by agglomeration into oligomeric clusters. These clusters eventually result in the creation of colloidal Ag particles with nanometer-sized dimensions.

At first, after the addition of a few mL of ammonia (NH 3 ) to the solution, there is the formation of a cloudy solution. After further addition of ammonia, the solution becomes colorless. The resultant reaction solution is transferred to an autoclave system and hydrothermally treated at 120 \u00b0C for 90 min. After the accomplishment of the reaction, the consequent system was allowed to cool down to room temperature. Then the synthesized powder was washed twice with DDW and ethanol, respectively, and kept for air drying at room temperature for 2 h. Finally, the ZnO nanorod was annealed for 2 h at 450 \u00b0C (Liu and Zeng 2003) . Then the resultant product is ground into a fine powder using a mortar and pestle.

Practically, there is no formation of any primary bonds like ionic, covalent, or metallic bonding.

Figure 5a indicates the formation of relatively spherical-shaped Ag NPs with an average diameter of 400 nm. The size of particles was increased due to agglomeration. The formation of homogeneously distributed nanocomposite of the Ag NPs is shown in Fig. 5b , Ag-ZnO (10% w/w), and Fig. 5c , Ag-ZnO (5% w/w). The SEM images reveal a random distribution of nanomaterials with large diameter nanorods of zinc oxide NPs and spherical-shaped Ag NPs. We clearly observe in the images that the nanorod gets broken as a result of 3 h of mechanical grinding. Figure 5d ZnO nanorods demonstrate the production of hexagonal nanorods with lengths of several thousand nm. It indicates the formation of a controlled size and regular hexagonal shape of the nanorods. The nanorods have solid hexagonal planes projecting out of the crystal seed layer, and their width is in the range of in between 100 and 1000 nm (Huang et al. 2015) . FE-SEM i.e. field emission scanning electron microscopy, analyze the size and morphology of sample. Figure 5e -h illustrates the FE-SEM analysis of Ag np's, ZnO nanorods and their composites. However, looking at the Fig. 5e i.e. FE-SEM image of Ag np's reveals the smaller spherical NPs and some larger particles were found infrequently agglomerated together (Twu et al. 2008) . Figure 5f , g and include the FE-SEM image of Ag-ZnO (10% w/w) and Ag-ZnO (5% w/w). Nevertheless, it is pretty clear that Ag np's are randomly dispersed around the ZnO nanorods, in which it is seen that the number of Ag np's is greater in the Ag-ZnO (10% w/w) as compared to the Ag-ZnO (5% w/w) (Wu et al. 2013) . Furthermore, FE-SEM image of ZnO sample is shown in Fig. 5h . It can be clearly seen that the ZnO sample comprises needle-like nanorods, addition to that, ZnO nanorods also show the unvarying uniform growth in aligned direction and a mean diameter of about 4000-7000 nm (Gao et al. 2013 ).",

Even if the incident light is monochromatic or non-divergent, like a laser, we see a fluctuation in the intensity of light. The fluctuation in light intensity is caused by Brownian motion in solution, which always occurs. The dimension of a particle can be determined as a result of the Brownian motion of the particle.

A value of 40-60 mV suggests excellent nanoparticle stability in most cases (Jyoti et al. 2016 ; Nagar and Devra 2019).",

The reduction process happens in two stages: hydrogen atom adsorption and water molecule elimination. A strong repulsive interaction exists between BH 4 \u2212 and 4-NP, making the reduction process difficult. The solution of NaBH 4 and 4-NP is stable due to electrostatic repulsion between the BH 4 \u2212 and 4-NP. Only NaBH 4 stabilizes this solution. When NaBH 4 is added to water, BH 4 \u2212 ions form, and in the case of metal oxides, hydrogen moves from BH 4 \u2212 to 4-NP. The hydrogenation catalytic process happens in several ways, depending on the surface quality of the Nanocatalyst. On the metal NPs surface, which works as a Nanocatalyst, electrons move from ",

The reduction of 2-Nitroaniline (2-NA), 3-Nitroaniline (3-NA) and 4-Nitroaniline (4-NA), over Ag NPs act as Nano-catalyst, was studied with the unaltered conditions. The absorption peak of the Nitro-group containing chemicals is at wavelength 413, 363 and 382 nm for 2-NA, 3-NA and 4-NA, respectively. Catalytic reduction of 2-NA, 3-NA and 4-NA are (Figs. 20a, 21a and 22a) analysed using UV-Vis spectra of the reaction. As the reaction proceeds the peak intensity reduces that indicates the conversion of 2-NA to 2-aminoaniline (2-AP), 3-NA to 3-aminoaniline (3-AP) and 4-NA to 4-aminoaniline (4-AP) it takes 12.5, 13-and 11.5-min. time, resp. for complete conversion.
