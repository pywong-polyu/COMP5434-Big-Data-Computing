RT-PCR tests were performed in suspected cases according to clinical practice. We compared maternal and perinatal outcomes in those with delivered pregnancies (n = 578) according to the presence or absence of specific IgG antibodies. Those with positive IgG were subdivided by the presence or absence of Covid-19 related symptoms at any time and the results of RT-PCR testing if performed. Therefore, we had 4 study groups: G1 (IgG negative), G2 (IgG positive, asymptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), G3 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR testing negative or not done), and G4 (IgG positive, symptomatic, RT-PCR positive).",

Spain has been one of the most severely affected by the first wave of SARS-CoV-2 pandemic with an official report of 218000 cases confirmed by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) on nasopharyngeal swabs (NFS) during the first wave, by May 10 th 2020 [2] . However, the national seroepidemiological study, conducted from April 27 th to May 11 th , suggested that the real number of infections was about 10 times higher [3] . This gap was justified by the lack of detection of asymptomatic cases or even the incomplete ascertainment of those with symptoms during the first wave of the pandemic. This study also showed that, within Spain, Madrid was particularly affected, reaching a seroprevalence of 11.5% [4] . The activity of the infection was not uniform even within cities, with wide differences in the infection rates described in their districts.",

Focusing on the direct impact, current knowledge is mainly derived of cases diagnosed by RT-PCR in women with suggestive symptoms or in those asymptomatic that are hospitalized for non-COVID-19 related reasons [7] . This shows that first, maternal complications appear to be similar to non-pregnant women in the same age group, although pregnant women might be at increased risk of admission to an intensive care unit, second, there is an increased risk of preterm birth and cesarean section, and third, vertical transmission is considered rare [8, 9] . However, the full spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection remains unknown because mild or asymptomatic infections in non-hospitalized women are underdiagnosed. This could be overcome by studying the seroprevalence in the population of pregnant women, which can yield key data for health care providers in the event of a second wave or a future pandemic.",

Nevertheless it is possible that the distribution of cases even within different city areas could be significantly different as has been documented for New York City [14] and the finding of a higher infection rate of pregnant women could be just a reflection of the infection rate in the area of the city that has been studied. Additionally, our study provides information about the evolution of seropositivity, showing that there is a delay of 2-3 weeks in its increment with respect to that observed in cases diagnosed by RT-PCR, until it becomes stable from week 18 [15] . This is in accordance with the expected time to develop IgG antibodies after detection of SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR. Interestingly 28% of infected women were asymptomatic in our study, and up to 60% in the study from Barcelona. This could be explained, at least partially, by our lower proportion of samples from the first trimester (43% vs 13%), since they found a significantly lower prevalence of symptomatic infection and hospital admissions in women in their first trimester than those in their third trimester. Pregnant women are usually healthy patients that frequently visit health care centers and therefore should be considered as a possible source of infection transmission to more vulnerable cohorts that also attend these areas. This asymptomatic aspect of SARS-CoV-19 infection in pregnant women has been described in other series in US [16, 17] and Europe [18, 19] where universal screening upon hospital admission has been proposed for better resource allocation and protection of the woman's contacts including other patients or health-care professionals. Our data show good overall maternal and perinatal outcomes in seropositive women, regardless of their symptoms. We stratified seropositive women in three groups according to their symptoms and RT-PCR confirmation. Pregnant women with symptomatic COVID-19 had higher BMI than non-infected women as has been described in non-obstetric population [20] , and reflecting the importance of prevention in the specific subgroup of the obese gravida. It is of interest the increased preterm birth rate when comparing the most symptomatic cases with RT-PCR confirmation (G4) with the reference population (G1) as well a higher rate of operative delivery. Our small sample size is limited to draw conclusions about the implication of SARS-CoV-2 infection in these findings, although these two outcomes had already been described in other cohorts of pregnant women with RT-PCR confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection [7] . Almost 2/3 of seropositive women had symptoms suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 infection but did not undergo RT-PCR testing, mainly for two reasons. Firstly, these were milder cases where the patients did not want to attend the emergency room for testing as they consider this as a non-safe place at that time. Secondly, most of the times when they referred these symptoms during their antenatal visit, they had already resolved and therefore it was considered unnecessary to test them given the poorer performance of RT-PCR if performed later on the disease [21] . Their maternal results were excellent since none of them required hospital admission for support and we found no significant differences regarding perinatal outcomes. Although we only have a small sample of asymptomatic seropositive women, their maternal and perinatal results overlap with those of uninfected pregnant women.",
