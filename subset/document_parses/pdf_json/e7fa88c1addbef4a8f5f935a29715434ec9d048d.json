But expressing concern is one thing, identifying serious candidates another. Such risks are likely to be novel, rare, and difficult to study; data will be scarce, making speculation necessary. Scientists who raise such concerns may face disapproval not only as doomsayers, but also for their unconventional views. Yet the costs of false negatives in these cases -of wrongly dismissing warnings about catastrophic risks -are by definition very high. For these reasons, aspects of the methodology and culture of science, such as its attitude to epistemic risk and to unconventional views, are relevant to the challenges of managing extreme technological risks. In this piece I discuss these issues with reference to a real-world example that shares many of the same features, that of so-called 'cold fusion'.",

Prediction and mitigation of ETRs [extreme technological risks] is likely to depend on long-range evaluation of possibilities that seem far-fetched, in some cases.

Given the nature of the risks involved, there is a high cost to 'false negatives'.",

As Kuhn (1962) observed, science is conservative, and there is strong cultural pressure on scientists to work within the current paradigm. Advances -Kuhn's 'scientific revolutions' -often depend on farsighted individuals who resist these pressures, to work outside the mainstream. The history of science offers many examples of such figures, whose work is often shunned for long periods, before eventual vindication. Of course, history offers far more examples of fringe proposals that were not vindicated by later developments. In general, we rely on the normal process of science to sort out the gems from the dross -it may take a long time in some cases, but we get there in the end. In the special case of ETR, however, such a delay might be extremely costly. This subproject investigates this danger, and ways to reduce it.",

I have tweaked the tenses in a few places, and added citations formerly provided by hyperlinks. And I have restored the title that I gave the piece originally in 2015 -Aeon preferred something a little less obscure!

Sometimes, like the Australians Barry Marshall and Robin Warren (who eventually won a Nobel prize for their discovery that stomach ulcers are caused by a bacterium), the mavericks get the last laugh. But should they have had to endure all those first laughs? We would have had better ulcer treatments sooner if Marshall and Warren had been listened to earlier, presumably. It is easy to imagine how the costs of delay might be much more severe. Suppose a maverick who had identified some previously unnoticed pathway to a new pandemic -millions of lives might hang on the question of who was laughing at whom. I'm a philosopher of science, and also co-founder of Cambridge's Centre for the Study of Existential Risk, so pessimistic speculations like these are part of my job. But in recent years I've been watching a real-life case. I've been following the fortunes of one of the most widelyridiculed groups in science (or pseudoscience, as their critics would say), the advocates of socalled 'cold fusion'. This community lives in what I now call a reputation trap, tainted with a reputation so dismissive, and so contagious, that the entire area is effectively off-limits to mainstream investigators. Anyone who is seen to approach the area with an open mind risks being pushed into the trap themselves -I speak from experience! I'm increasingly convinced that the culture of reputation traps is unhealthy for science, and potentially dangerous for all of us, at least in cases where the costs of 'wrongful dismissal' are especially high. In particular, I'm worried that science itself is caught in a kind of meta trap. It is unable to consider the possibility that it is insufficiently open-minded, because the reputational fences themselves prevent it from asking the question whether the fences are too high, or erected in the wrong places.",

Fleischmann and Pons claimed to have found evidence that such reactions could occur in palladium loaded with deuterium (an isotope of hydrogen). A few other physicists, including Sergio Focardi at Bologna (Wikipedia contributors, 2021a), claimed similar effects with nickel and ordinary hydrogen. But most were highly sceptical, and the field 'subsequently gained a reputation as pathological science,' as Wikipedia puts it (Wikipedia contributors, 2021b).

I thought Rossi, on grounds of the physics. Superluminal neutrinos would overturn a fundamental tenet of relativity, but all Rossi needed was a previously unnoticed channel to a reservoir of energy whose existence is not in doubt. We know that huge amounts of energy are locked up in metastable nuclear configurations, trapped like water behind a dam. There's no known way to get useful access to that energy, at low temperatures.

Authors who do put their head above the parapet are ignored or rebuked. Most recently, Lunden and Lidgren report (Lewan 2015c ) that they submitted their paper to the journal Plasma Physics and Controlled Fusion, but that the editors declined to have it reviewed; and that even the non-reviewed preprint archive, arxiv.org, refused to accept it. So, as a matter of sociology, it is easy to see why Rossi gets little serious attention; why an interview with Tom Darden associates him with scientific chicanery; and why, I hope, some of you are having doubts about me, for writing about the subject in a way that indicates that I am prepared to consider it seriously. (If so, hold that attitude. I want to explain why I take it to reflect a pathology in our present version of the scientific method. My task will be easier if you are still suffering from the symptoms.) Sociology is one thing, but rational explanation another. It is very hard to extract from this history any satisfactory justification for ignoring recent work on LENR. After all, the standard line is that the rejection of cold fusion in 1989 turned on the failure to replicate the claims of Fleischmann and Pons. Yet if that were the real reason, then the rejection would have to be provisional. Failure to replicate couldn't possibly be more than provisional -empirical science is a fallible business, as any good scientist would acknowledge. In that case, well-done results claiming to overturn the failure to replicate would certainly be of great interest.",

But they might like to recall the case of Lord Rutherford, greatest nuclear physicist of his day, who famously claimed that 'anyone who expects a source of power from transformation of . . . atoms is talking moonshine' -the very day before Leo Szilard, prompted by newspaper reports of Rutherford's remarks, figured out the principles of the chain reaction that makes nuclear fission useable as an energy source, peaceful or otherwise. (The story is told in Rhodes 1986, ch. 1.) This is not to deny that there is truth in the principle popularised by Carl Sagan, that extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. We should certainly be very cautious about such surprising claims, unless and until we amass a great deal of evidence. But this is not a good reason for ignoring such evidence in the first place, or refusing to contemplate the possibility that it might exist. (As Robert Godes said recently, 'It is sad that such people say that science should be driven by data and results, but at the same time refuse to look at the actual results'; Bj\u00f8rkeng 2015.) Again, there's a sociological explanation why few people are willing to look at the evidence. They put their reputations at risk by doing so. Cold fusion is tainted, and the taint is contagiousanyone seen to take it seriously risks contamination themselves. So the subject is stuck in a place that is largely inaccessible to reason -a reputation trap, we might call it. People outside the trap won't go near it, for fear of falling in. 'If there is something scientists fear it is to become like pariahs,' as Rickard Lundin puts it (Lewan 2015c) . People inside the trap are already regarded as disreputable, an attitude that trumps any efforts they might make to argue their way out, by reason and evidence.",

Rossi's own background is not in these laboratories, but he acknowledges that his methods owe much to those who are, or were -especially to the late Sergio Focardi, one of the pioneers of the field (Wikipedia contributors 2021a). To anyone willing to listen, the community will say that they have amassed a great deal of evidence of excess heat, not explicable in chemical terms, and of various markers of nuclear processes. Some, including a team at one of Italy's leading research centres, say that they have many replications of the Fleischmann and Pons results (ENEA 2013). 2 Again, the explanation for ignoring these claims cannot be that other attempts failed, twenty five years ago. That makes no sense at all. Rather, it's the reputation trap. The results are ignored because they concern cold fusion, which we 'know' to be pseudoscience -we know it because attempts to replicate these experiments failed, twenty five years ago! The reasoning is still entirely circular, but the reputation trap gives its conclusion a convincing mask of respectability. That's how the trap works.",

Going one better, they installed it in physics laboratories that had been excavated under a mountain called the Gran Sasso, a two-hour drive from Rome. Anywhere on the surface of the Earth, there are always some neutrons buzzing around due to cosmic radiation from outer space. This so-called \"background\" has to be subtracted from the neutrons produced by any other phenomenon such as Cold Fusion. In the galleries under the Gran Sasso, the shielding effect of the mountain reduces the cosmic ray neutron background nearly to zero. That's why the laboratory was built there. An automated system was set up to monitor the neutron counter while running the temperature of a Scaramuzzi-type deuterium gas cell up and down. Every week or so, a member of the group would have to drive out to the Gran Sasso lab, check out the counters, replenish the supply of liquid nitrogen, and bring back the data. No one could accuse them any longer of being unsophisticated about neutron work. However, this experiment, like their own earlier work and many others blossoming around the world, produced positive results, but only sporadically. There was no dependable recipe for coaxing bursts of neutrons out of the Cold Fusion cell. (Goodstein 1994) whether distinguished sceptics end up with egg on their faces.

But there may be a huge cost to a false negative. If Rossi, Godes, Lunden, Lidgren and others do turn out to have something useful -something that can make some useful contribution to meeting our desperate need for clean, cheap energywe will have wasted a generation of progress, by dumping cold fusion in the reputation trap. What we should have done instead is to have engineered the exact opposite of a reputation trap -an X Prize-like reward for the first reliable replication of the Fleischmann and Pons results, above some commercial bar, perhaps. Now I can explain what I meant earlier, when I asked you to hold on to the thought that I must be a bit flakey myself, if that's your reaction to my willingness to take cold fusion seriously. If you do think that -at least if you think it without having studied the evidence for yourself -then your reaction is a symptom of the reputation trap. But I've now suggested that the trap itself may be an irrational pathology, in a special case like this, where the cost of a false negative is very high. If I'm right, then in a more rational world, we would fix our scientific norms to escape it. In a more rational world, you wouldn't think I'm flakey. I don't need to deny that your reaction is an appropriate one, by the standards of science as we currently practice it, or that those standards work pretty well, in general. Reputation traps have a useful purpose, in the Kuhnian picture. They help to maintain the stability important to what Kuhn called normal science -the ordinary, useful kind of science when paradigms are not under threat. But this is compatible with the claim that they can be harmful in special cases (of which cold fusion may be one) -and that we could do better, if we were better at identifying those cases in advance.",

Once again, it was the reputation trap at work. This attitude could be disastrous in other cases, if the ideas stuck in the trap are the key to early detection of some potentially catastrophic risk.

In my view, it was a fascinating story whatever the outcome. Even if it was fraud, it was an extraordinarily elaborate and long-lasting fraud, in which the victims included some well-known individuals and financial institutions. Yet there was virtually no coverage of the story, even from this angle. I took this to be a further manifestation of the reputation trap. One couldn't write about the story without putting on the table the view obviously held by Tom Darden and other financial backers, that LENR might not be pseudoscience after all -and that view was taboo, by the standards of the reputation trap.",

Here we describe our efforts, which have yet to yield any evidence of such an effect.

Should the phenomenon happen to be real (itself an open question), there may be good technical reasons why proponents of cold fusion have struggled to detect anomalous effects reliably and reproducibly. Continued scepticism of cold fusion is justified, but we contend that additional investigation of the relevant conditions is required before the phenomenon can be ruled out entirely.

Moreover, the study showed that there are interesting things still to learn about the materials science of the palladium-hydrogen system.

Here he quotes Curtis Berlinguette, head of the Berlinguette research group at UBC, Vancouver, and lead author on the Nature Perspectives piece. \"Renewable energy and fusion technologies are not scaling at the pace we need them to,\" says Berlinguette. \"If cold fusion were realizable, it could take the world into an era of energy surplus rather than scarcity. It therefore seemed irresponsible to not take another look at it. For me, cold fusion started in 2015,\" says Berlinguette. \"Prior to that, I didn't know enough about it to have an opinion.

His epistemic attitude is also admirable. My experience in this field is that 'not knowing enough about it' doesn't prevent people from having very strong opinions -hence my plea for 'epistemic humility' at the end of my 2019 piece.",

Clean Planet Inc. is a venture enterprise that has worked on the research and development of Quantum Hydrogen Energy, a safe, stable, and affordable source of clean energy, in order to create groundbreaking innovations in the energy industry, a vital element of social infrastructure. Quantum Hydrogen Energy is currently attracting attention globally, and large companies and investors representing every industry are beginning full-scale participation in this field, as can be seen from the entry of a major US IT company. Against this background, Clean Planet Inc. has embarked on a range of cutting-edge research and development efforts in collaboration with Tohoku University, and in April 2021 began work on development for practical use for release of one kilowatt of thermal energy using Quantum Hydrogen Energy. (Miura 2021) This news has received some coverage in the mainstream Japanese business press, though not as far as I know in the West. This is from the NikkeiBP website: Since then, research has progressed steadily toward practical use, so [Clean Planet] decided to start full-scale joint development with Miura Co., Ltd. regarding its application to industrial boilers. A prototype will be produced in 2022 and will be commercialized in 2023. (NikkeiBP 2021) An excellent impression of Clean Planet's apparent progress over the past decade is conveyed by Figure 1 , reproduced with permission from the Clean Planet website (Clean Planet 2021) . Note, in particular, the reported timings of completion of a 100W 'model device ' (2018) and 'starting testing' of 1kW prototypes (May 2021).",

In magnetic confinement fusion, the fuel is heated in a plasma to temperatures much higher than those at the center of the Sun. In the new method, conditions sufficient for fusion are created in the confines of the metal lattice that is held at ambient temperature. While the metal lattice, loaded with deuterium fuel, may initially appear to be at room temperature, the new method creates an energetic environment inside the lattice where individual atoms achieve equivalent fusion-level kinetic energies.

This has led to a stalemate where adequate funding is not accessible to establish irrefutable evidence and understanding of LENR, and lack of the latter precludes the field from accessing adequate funding. Building on and leveraging the most promising recent developments in LENR research, ARPA-E envisions a potential two-phase approach toward breaking this stalemate: (1) Support targeted R&D toward establishing at least one on-demand, repeatable LENR experiment with diagnostic evidence that is convincing to the wider scientific community (focus of this workshop); (2) If phase 1 above is successful (metrics to be determined), support a broader range of R&D activities (to be defined later) toward better understanding of LENR and its potential for scale-up toward disruptive energy applications, thus setting up LENR for broader and more systematic support by both the public and private sectors.

A better image would be nailing our own feet to the floor -that combines unnecessary self-harm with self-imposed impediment to the exploration of an important search-space. Cold fusion will live on in the history of science as a classic example of how to get this wrong, in my view, even if it never boils a cup of tea. 7",

McKubre, a New Zealand-born electrochemist, had worked with Martin Fleischmann in Southampton, some years before the 1989 announcement. He became a leading figure among the small group of scientists who regarded the dismissal of the Fleischmann and Pons results as too hasty. He was Director of the Energy Research Center at SRI International for many years. By 2019 McKubre was semi-retired, spending most of the year in his home town of Napier, New Zealand. I was on leave in my home town of Sydney, Australia. I took advantage of our proximity to visit McKubre in Napier. We had dinner together on the thirtieth anniversary of the Pons and Fleischmann announcement in 1989. There were three thirtieth anniversary meetings that month: one at MIT, one at the Russian Academy of Natural Sciences, Moscow, and -most exclusive of all -McKubre and I, with our wives, in Napier, New Zealand.",
