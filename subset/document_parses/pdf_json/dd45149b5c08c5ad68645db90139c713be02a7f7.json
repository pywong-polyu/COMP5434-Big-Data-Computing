In this study, we aim to investigate the evidence regarding the prevalence of cardiac complications and the resulting mortality rate in COVID-19 patients. . Inclusion criterion was reviewing and reporting cardiac complications in patients with confirmed COVID-19. Results: The initial search resulted in 853 records, out of which 40 articles were included. Overall analysis showed that the prevalence of acute cardiac injury, heart failure and cardiac arrest were 19.46% (95% CI: 18.23-20.72), 19.07% (95% CI: 15.38-23.04) and 3.44% (95% CI: 3.08-3.82), respectively. Moreover, abnormal serum troponin level was observed in 22.86% (95% CI: 21.19-24.56) of the COVID-19 patients. Further analysis revealed that the overall odds of mortality is 14.24 (95% CI: 8.67-23.38) times higher when patients develop acute cardiac injury. The pooled odds ratio of mortality when the analysis was limited to abnormal serum troponin level was 19.03 (95% CI: 11.85-30.56). Conclusion: Acute cardiac injury and abnormal serum troponin level were the most prevalent cardiac complications/abnormalities in COVID-19 patients. The importance of cardiac complications is emphasized due to the higher mortality rate among patients with these complications. Thus, troponin screenings and cardiac evaluations are recommended to be performed in routine patient assessments.",

The prevalence of each cardiac complication among the COVID-19 patients was calculated with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) using the \"metaprop_one\" command performed on the total sample size and the number of patients presenting each complication in the included articles. In the second part of the analysis, the association between the manifestation of cardiac complications/abnormalities and mortality rate was calculated and presented as an overall odds ratio (OR) with a 95% CI using the \"metan\" command performed on four groups of data: number of the deceased in patients with a cardiac complication, number of the alive in patients with the cardiac complication, number of the deceased in patients without the cardiac complication, number of the alive in patients without the cardiac complication. I2 test was performed to assess heterogeneity, and if the heterogeneity among data was considerable, random effect model was used to calculate 95% CI.

In general, 9 different cardiac complications/abnormalities were reported in the studies including acute cardiac injury, which was reported in 26 studies (5, (5, 34, 42) , myocarditis, reported in two studies (9, 44), cardiac insufficiency, reported in two studies (29, 30), pericardial effusion, reported in two studies (21, 31) and cardiomyopathy (45) and myocardial infarction (32), each reported in one study.

Interestingly, no heterogeneity was observed when calculating the OR for the mortality in COVID-19 patients with abnormal serum troponin level ( Figure 6 ). There are two possible outlier studies in abnormal troponin level section. After excluding these studies, the odds of mortality in COVID-19 patients with acute cardiac injury is increased slightly (OR=17.07; 95% CI: 10.41 to 27.99). The odds of mortality of patients having other cardiac complications are presented in Table 3 .",

            "text": "In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the prevalence of 9 cardiac complications in COVID-19 patients and their subsequent mortality rates. Abnormal serum level of troponin with 22.86% prevalence, detected by laboratory tests, and acute cardiac injury with 19.46% prevalence, diagnosed with laboratory test results and other diagnostic techniques, were among the most prevalent complications/abnormalities observed in COVID-19 patients. Although a large number of studies reported the prevalence of the two mentioned cardiac complications, no heterogeneity was observed in this section. To contemplate even more on the matter, the prevalence of abnormal troponin level and acute cardiac injury are rather close numbers, which might mean that by close observation of troponin changes in a COVID-19 patient, we could possibly anticipate acute cardiac injuries in them and take appropriate measures. However, serum troponin levels also increase due to damage to other tissues, such as the kidneys, which may make it impossible to use troponin level alone to detect cardiac damage. Other cardiac complications such as heart failure and cardiomyopathy were also prevalent among the patients. However, with the small number of the studies observing them, more data is needed on the matter. Regarding the limitations, each individual article used a different reference range for troponin or other injury indicators to be classified as abnormal, and each one used different diagnostic and laboratory test results to define acute cardiac injury, which could cause slight differences in the reported prevalence of acute cardiac injury and abnormal serum level of troponin. For example, Huang et al. defined acute cardiac injury as cardiac troponin rising to 3 or more times than normal or appearance of new abnormalities in echocardiography or ECG (19); While many others defined it only with the appearance of abnormal troponin levels in blood samples. Moreover, some articles' study population only consisted of critically ill patients or deceased ones, which could shift prevalence statistics, causing inevitable heterogeneity in reported numbers (5, 15, 32) . Additionally, it is worth mentioning that the mechanism of myocardial injury, whether being done by direct viral invasion to the host tissue or due to imbalanced homeostasis, was of no concern for the writers at the time. Although more research should be conducted to identify the exact causes of this damage, the effects it carries are the most important subject that should be studied at these critical times. Even though limitations were present in data reporting the prevalence of cardiac outcomes, it is important to pay enough attention to these complications, since many of them are directly related to patients' general situation and illness severity. On the other hand, our study shows intriguing data regarding mortality rate in patients presenting with cardiac complications, especially acute cardiac injury and abnormal serum level of troponin. Abnormal troponin levels are associated with about 19 times higher mortality risk in COVID-19 patients, which is of great importance in disease management for health care providers around the world. Considering the fact that no heterogeneity was observed regarding the risk of mortality in patients with abnormal troponin level, laboratory screening during routine patient assessments can be critical in early detection of cardiac injury and intervening accordingly. In addition, we suggest that blood levels of troponin should be evaluated as a prognostic factor in patients with cardiac involvement. Furthermore, our data indicated that acute cardiac injury could raise the mortality to about 14 times more in COVID-19 patients. However, this number was associated with an overall heterogeneity, which could be attributed to different definitions of cardiac injury in studies, discussed above. Nonetheless, although one can conclude that there is a relationship between acute cardiac injury following COVID-19 and increased risk of mortality, the threat that acute cardiac injury poses to patients' health status in the future is undeniable and demands careful monitoring and managements when confronting this situation. Moreover, it is noteworthy that articles reporting mortality rates of cardiac complications were mostly focused on abnormal troponin level and myocardial injury and the number of the articles reporting correlations between other cardiac complications such as heart failure, and mortality rate was very few; so, we cannot present an exact estimation of the contribution of other cardiac outcomes such as heart failure and myocarditis to patients' fatality. In addition, inability to blind the outcome assessors in the studies and some articles not explicitly presenting inclusion and exclusion criteria were further limitations detected in the studies. Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis and excluded possible outlier studies. The overall effect size slightly changed and therefore, the results seem to be robust. To conclude, our findings thoroughly approve of other published articles investigating associations between COVID-19 cardiac outcomes and related mortalities (47, 48), confirming that cardiac injury, regardless of the mechanism of establishment, is a factor determining disease severity and patient prognosis reliably in large scale and should be considered and monitored from early stages of disease.",
