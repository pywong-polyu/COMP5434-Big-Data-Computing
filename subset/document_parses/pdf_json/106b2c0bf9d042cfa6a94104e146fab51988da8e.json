From these images various cellular features can be extracted. Together these features form phenotypes that can be used to determine effective drug therapies, such as those based on nanomedicines. Unfortunately, fluorescence microscopy is time-consuming, expensive, labour intensive, and toxic to the cells. Brightfield images lack these downsides but also lack the clear contrast of the cellular components and hence are difficult to use for downstream analysis. Generating the fluorescence images directly from bright-field images using virtual staining (also known as \"label-free prediction\" and \"in-silico labeling\") can get the best of both worlds, but can be very challenging to do for poorly visible cellular structures in the bright-field images. To tackle this problem deep learning models were explored to learn the mapping between bright-field and fluorescence images for adipocyte cell images. The models were tailored for each imaging channel, paying particular attention to the various challenges in each case, and those with the highest fidelity in extracted cell-level features were selected. The solutions included utilizing privileged information for the nuclear channel, and using image gradient information and adversarial training for the lipids channel. The former resulted in better morphological and count features and the latter resulted in more faithfully captured defects in the lipids, which are key features required for downstream analysis of these channels.",

            "text": "Nanomedicine uptake and effect on fat cells (adipocytes) can be explored using microscopy imaging techniques applied to stem cell derived cell cultures. The lipid droplets within the adipocytes play a key role in metabolism and are implicated in several pathologies, including cancer, diabetes and obesity [1] . They provide fuel for the organism and supply a safeguard for energy fluctuations [2] . Membrane surfaces of lipid droplets can contain hundreds of different proteins (such as perilipins, enzymes and trafficking proteins) that allow them to function as energy repositories and interact with other cellular components [3] . The of nanomedicine transfection can therefore cause physical remodeling of the lipid droplets as the cells respond to the increased energy demands and the resulting phenotypic signatures can be used to evaluate nanomedicine efficacy. Therapies that modify adipocyte phenotypes can also be used to adjust metabolic profiles towards more healthy states by encouraging catabolic lipid processing [4] . Furthermore, using nanoparticle delivery of mRNA to adipocytes, via subcutaneous injection, is a very promising next-generation approach for protein replacement therapies and vaccination [5] . Such mRNA based vaccinations are also currently being developed for Covid-19 [6] . A typical workflow in image cytometry utilizes fluorescent staining and imaging to extract relevant features from cells (such as morphology, count and intensity) and subsequently builds classifiers for various purposes based on these features. Labelling with fluorescent dyes is a well-established and effective method for identifying cellular components. However, imaging fluorescence stains does not come without drawbacks. They require sample preparation, are time-consuming, expensive and labor intensive to develop, and are often toxic to the cells. For example, Hoechst staining is commonly used to visualize cell nuclei because this blue-fluorescent dye binds to DNA, this binding however tends to disrupt normal DNA processing. The fluorescent dyes must also be excited using relatively short high-energy wavelengths resulting in the production of toxic free-radicals. While these problems can be mitigated using experimental design, they are impossible to avoid completely, particularly when performing timelapse imaging experiments with many exposures [7] . If possible it would be better to circumvent the need for these fluorescent stains and short wavelength light exposures. Additionally, there is a limit to the number of cellular components that can be imaged simultaneously for a given sample due to spectral overlap of the requisite fluorescence dyes.",

            "text": "In recent years deep learning has shown impressive results for image reconstruction and enhancement tasks in image cytometry including deblurring, denoising and super-resolution, and has recently shown promise as a virtual staining method [8, 9] . The \"in-silico labeling\" approach used by [10] is a particularly noteworthy example of the latter. They proposed a U-Net deep learning architecture [11] and inception-inspired modules [12] to generate fluorescence images given transmitted-light images as input. Their model was trained with pixelwise cross entropy loss. Using only pixel-wise loss, however, their generated images in some instances lacked global coherence [13] . Also noted, in their virtual staining method for histological images, that training using only pixel-wise loss led to good localization but to poor resolution of finer cellular structures. There are many loss functions and architectural choices that can be explored to combat these issues. For instance, for generating crisp, realistic looking images generative adversarial networks (GANs; [14] ) have shown great promise. As opposed to computing the losses over pixels, GANs work with losses at the image-level (or across patches of an image) and push the generated images towards the natural image manifold [15] . In its basic form a GAN plays out a zero-sum game between two networks-a generator and a discriminator. The generator creates counterfeit images which it hopes to deceive the discriminator with, whilst the discriminator attempts to correctly classify the real and fake images. Convergence is reached when the discriminator can no longer tell the difference between the images. For image-to-image translation tasks conditional GANs are often applied. The conditional discriminator sees both the input to the generator and the fake or real outputs. This can help alleviate the problem of artifacts that GANs can produce and was used in, for instance, the Pix2Pix algorithm [16] . In the field of virtual staining, conditional GANs have been used by, for example, [17] for histological staining of prostate core RGB images, and by [18] for histological staining of skin, liver and kidney tissue sections. Additional virtual staining methods and applications of note include the 3D U-Net-based approach used in [19] , for 3D fluorescence reconstruction, and the dual adversarially trained autoencoder model used in [20] . This latter method used nuclear and cell fluorescence stains to train a first autoencoder, learning a probabilistic encoding for cell and nuclear shape, upon which a second \"wedded\" autoencoder was used for generating additional subcellular structures, conditional on this encoding.",

The key idea of the LUPI paradigm is that the machine learner, the \"student\", has an \"intelligent teacher\" that provides additional (privileged) information during the training phase, to improve and accelerate the learning process. Through LUPI the learner gains a better concept of similarity between training objects and also receives hidden insights (explanations from the teacher) to guide decision rule formation. The privileged information can be anything that potentially aids the networks during the training process, but that is not required or available during inference. The privileged information can help to focus the network's attention on locations in the data that are difficult to predict. The way in which this is done in deep learning is to develop separate network streams, one for the main task and one based on the privileged information, and then to incorporate some means of guiding the main model with insights from the privileged information stream [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] .",

If there are significant errors in these generated fluorescence images the downstream segmentation of the nuclei will fail, a step that is crucial for obtaining subsequent measures of nuclear features. Furthermore a common approach for downstream analysis of the images is to use a CellProfiler [27] pipeline in which the nuclei (from the nuclear stain) are used for providing seeds to the segmentation algorithms that delineate the cell boundaries (the cytoplasm). Hence, the nuclear channel is very important and needs careful consideration. As a potential aid to the nuclear model we therefore apply LUPI using segmentation masks as privileged information. To the best of our knowledge, the work in this paper presents the first application of LUPI in virtual staining for image cytometry.",

In this paper, we propose a method to generate fluorescent labels for adipocyte cell images directly from bright-field z-stacks. This is done by constructing three different models, one each for nuclei, cytoplasm, and lipid droplets. The faithfulness of this translation is compared at both the image and feature level, but with more emphasis on the features.",

Since the lipids can occlude and alter the appearance of the nuclei a wide range of diameters and shapes were used to filter out irrelevant objects. The objects were then filtered based on shape features to remove incorrectly identified nuclear objects. For the lipid droplets, small and large droplets were identified separately. Since the droplets have similar intensities they are identified by a global threshold across the expected range of diameters for the two groups. Lipids that were clumped together were distinguished based on their intensities. The defects in the lipid droplets were found by morphological reconstruction (a rolling-ball algorithm) where the image is successively eroded and reconstructed to identify dark holes within bright regions. Cytoplasmic regions were identified starting with nuclear objects as seeds. Here the combination of the cytoplasmic images and the lipids (which are contained within the cytoplasm) were utilized by averaging them together. Cell bodies were then identified by an adaptive threshold with a window size larger than that of nuclei. For all cellular structures features were extracted separately and are shown in Table 1 .",

Like the traditional U-Net [11] this model consist of a contracting/downsampling path (encoder) and an expanding/upsampling (decoder) path, with concatenating skip connections between the two. These skip connections aid the upsampling path in recovering finer grained spatial information from the downsampling path. The dense U-Net extends this basic U-Net architecture through the use of dense blocks consisting of batch-normalization-ReLU-convolution-dropout operations that are densely connected (within a block) to one another in a feed forward fashion (i.e. there is a skip connection with the output of each quartet of operations to every subsequent quartet). On the contracting path there are also skip connections that hop over each dense block. These dense blocks and additional skip connections result in a network that has multi-scale deep supervision with feature propagation and reuse, permitting the training of deeper networks but with fewer parameters than would otherwise be required (see Fig 2 which illustrates the dense U-Net model). The transition down layers consist of spatial max pooling and the transition up layers pixel-shuffle followed by blurring to reduce checkerboard artifacts in the network outputs, as proposed in [31] . The dense U-Net has shown promising results in, for instance, predicting cell traction forces [32] and image restoration [33] .",

Our discriminator also worked at the patch level, rather than at the entire image level, achieved by limiting the receptive field. Working with such patches promotes sharper outputs, better capturing local style characteristics, and to some extent introduces a form of style/texture loss [16] . In combination with this, the models were trained with a Relativistic Average Least Squares GAN (raLSGAN) loss, which is a combination of the relativistic GAN [34] and the least square GAN [35] . In traditional GANs the discriminator estimates the probability that an image is real, whereas in relativistic GANs the discriminator estimates the probability that a real image is more realistic than fake images and conversely, that a fake image is less realistic than a real image. This relativism passes more information to the generator and can significantly improve both generated image quality and training stability. The least square GAN replaces the probability with a least squares loss, i.e. instead of estimating the probability of an image being real or fake it minimizes the least square distance between the two. The losses for the generator and discriminator can be expressed as,",

The weights are reduced in a pyramidal fashion from the central pixel towards the edges. The inference is then performed on overlapping tiles to reduce GPU memory consumption and to have similar receptive fields during training and inference. The outputs are multiplied by the weight mask prior to averaging to create the full image. The method was applied with a tile size of 512\u00d7512 pixels and a stride of 256\u00d7256 pixels.",

Effect of each loss/model configuration on the generated images evaluated on the three groups of CellProfiler features for the nuclear and lipids channels. The scores are the combined mean and standard deviation over the generated images against the ground truth across the three splits. improvements were not significant (p = 0.122 and p = 0.135 respectively). The largest overall improvement came with the combination of both gradient and adversarial loss (p \ufffd 0.001 for all feature groups), where the largest change for the better was for the count features. Both the adversarial and the gradient loss assist in the delineation of the lipids in the reconstruction of the defects within some of the lipids, relative to the base model, as can be seen in Fig 7. An observation from the ablation studies, for both the nuclear and lipids channels, was that the pixel-wise MAE did not capture the full picture of model performance. For the lipid droplets, training without the adversarial loss gave the best MAE score. As this metric only summarises the closeness between the generated and ground truth images, it cannot capture all the aspects of the image reconstruction fidelity that may be of interest. This metric is also based on both the foreground and background in the images. In many cases the background is of little or no interest. On the other hand, the feature based metrics we explored are based solely upon on the foreground/objects of interest. The feature set was based upon the cell-level features that biologists routinely extract from such data, and hence they provide much better statistics with which to root model comparison and selection.

Fig 9A and 9D shows the generated and ground truth for the nuclei. As can be seen in the maximum projection of the bright-field z-stack (Fig 9G) generating the nuclei from the bright-field images poses significant challenges-nuclei not surrounded by lipid droplets are barely visible. However, the proposed method manages to find these nuclei well (see for instance right most nuclei in Fig  9A. 1). The model also faithfully captures the shape of the nuclei, which is supported by the results in Table 2 and Fig 6, where the LWM improves significantly over the baseline model on the shape features. However, difficulties in predicting the nuclei can be seen also in Fig 9A.1 where the model misses a nucleus in a location where one should be present. Hence, although this problem of missing nuclei is reduced when using the LWM, as opposed to the base model, it has not been entirely eliminated. Occasionally, also the opposite problem occurs, where the model predicted a nucleus in a location where no nucleus was present. These errors tended to occur in small gaps in densely clustered lipid regions where nuclei are often located. Fig 9B and 9E show the generated and ground truth images for the lipid droplets. Since the droplets are quite visible in the bright-field (see for instance Fig 9G. 2) this reconstruction task is significantly simpler. The main difficulties lies in reconstructing the droplets internal structures, such as the small defects. From Fig 7 and Table 2 the reconstruction of these defects improved significantly with the gradient based loss and the adversarial training.",

The most tailored solution was for the nuclear channel. In many cases the nuclei have only a ghostlike presence in the bright-field images (see Fig 9) . We therefore chose to apply the LUPI paradigm to guide the model for this channel, using segmentation masks as privileged information to guide for the predictions. This guidance led to significantly improved results which is in line with related work using LUPI for image related tasks [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . For the lipids channel we found that adding gradient and especially adversarial loss gave significant improvements in delineating the lipids and in reconstructing the defective parts within them (Figs 7 and 9 ). Defective lipids become caved in, with intensity depressions, and are often clustered together inside the same cell-an active cell. Locating and quantifying these defects is an important ingredient of the nanomedicine drug discovery process, hence faithfully reconstructing these intensity depressions with our models is crucial.",

As downstream analysis from fluorescence images is based on the derived features, including the design of effective drug therapies, we believe that this focus is of higher benefit when applying deep learning to the task of creating virtually stained images.",

In the context of nanoparticles and vaccines, for example, this enables additional measurements of particle uptake, cargo delivery and functional measurements [39] . Virtual staining also delivers results at a fraction of the cost and time required for traditional fluorescence imaging [13] . As our trained models are lightweight, and generate the virtually stained images relatively quickly, they could potentially be directly integrated into the image acquisition software connected to the microscopes to essentially enable \"augmented microscopy\" [40] .",

These images are used to train and compare specialized models for generating each stain, based on biologically relevant features. The selected models are then used to virtually stain bright-field images. A. Nuclear virtual staining model which simultaneously learns the nuclear segmentation (the privileged information model, the outer-most decoder path) and the generated image for the nuclear channel (the inner-most decoder path), B. Virtual staining model for the cytoplasm and C. Virtual staining model for lipid droplets, the model utilizes a patch-level discriminator, used for adversarial training.https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0258546.g001",
