IB and SARS-CoV-2 viruses have many similarities: both are low copy coronavirus, both have a lipid envelope, and for both, the immune system reaction contributes significantly to the damage. These give the basis to believe that the mechanisms of action of these two viruses are similar.",

Specifically, bacteriophage \u03d56 belonging to the Cystoviridae family is a promising model. These phage particles have a spherical or icosahedral shape and dsRNA type of nucleic acid. The presence of capsids in its composition makes it an effective model for testing the activity of virucidals and disinfectants against enveloped viruses, including coronaviruses. The virucidal activity of substances determined with the \u03d56 bacteriophage model allows the estimation of their activity against various viruses containing lipids in their capsid, such as herpesviruses 1 and 2 and coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, which infect eukaryotic cells [7] [8] [9] . The \u03d56 bacteriophage infects P. phaseolicola plant pathogen bacteria. Consequently, the advantage of working experimentally with a \u03d56 bacteriophage and plant pathogenic bacteria is that neither the phage nor the bacteria are pathogenic to humans, which minimizes the requirements for the laboratory biosafety level. Some research groups successfully applied the \u03d56 bacteriophage as a model for the SARS-CoV-2 virus [10, 11] .",

Clinical observations showed the effectiveness of Ecocid, Triviron, Argovit, and lauric acid monoglyceride (C12) against viral mal-absorption in poultry farms (flavivirus, astroviral etiology). Ecocid shows high antibacterial and virucidal activity combined with low toxicity and stability in a living organism, making it a promising alternative as a topical virucidal agent [12] and a disinfectant that prevents the horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance genes [13] . Triviron virucidal formulation began to be used in veterinary medicine relatively recently [14, 15] . The mechanism of action has no analogs and belongs to a new pharmacological group of synthetic ribonucleases [2, 16] . Silver nanoparticles [8, [17] [18] [19] [20] including Argovit AgNPs [21] [22] [23] [24] have recently shown virucidal effects against some viruses, and are therefore also potentially effective against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. Lauric acid monoglyceride (Monolaurin) is known to inactivate lipid-coated viruses by binding to the lipid-protein envelope of the virus, thereby preventing it from attaching and entering host cells, making infection and replication impossible [25] . Other studies show that Monolaurin disintegrates the protective viral envelope, killing the virus [26, 27] . Monolaurin has been studied to inactivate many pathogens, including the Herpes simplex virus [25] [26] [27] [28] .",

The staining is carried out within a short period (20 min), during which dye diffusion occurs in a thin layer of cells, which avoids the intense background fluorescence of entire pieces of tissue. Thus, in contrast to histological examination, a short period staining mode is suitable for studying thin tissue layers. This mode makes it possible to visualize better epithelial and endothelial cells (for example, the inner surface of the bronchi and blood vessels and intestinal epithelium). Additionally, this mode provides a good visualization of blood capillaries, hemorrhages, and tissue saturation with hemoglobin, which is accompanied by a sharp decrease in fluorescence intensity. The difference of this luminescence microscopic mode from confocal microscopy lies in the lower price of the used equipment, faster staining process, more detailed observations of epithelium surfaces, and the influence of the diffusion process microscopic picture.",

The small intestine also showed hyperemia. The large intestine was unchanged. The kidneys were not inflamed. In most experimental groups, changes in the intestines, lungs, and thymus were completely absent or less pronounced than in the control group. The most severe lesions were observed in the control and then in the lauric acid monoglyceride-treated group organs.

The period of six days after inoculation was adequate time for the dissemination of the virus to all organs by blood circulation. Supposing that the intestine was not the organ with optimal conditions (among the three studied organs) for virus replication, after 6 days, the concentration of the virus would be maximal in other organs (if they have optimal conditions for replication), for example, in the lungs. However, this was not observed experimentally. Instead, the highest viral concentration was observed in the intestine. Hence, the obtained results suggest that the intestine is the organ with the highest cell secretory potential, receptors, and enzyme systems suitable for the reproduction of coronavirus and the maturation of viral particles, which creates optimal conditions for primary virus replication and accumulation. It implies that, specifically, the intestine serves as a source for virus dissemination to other organs. Low virus concentrations in the lungs and thymus could indicate that viral replication is occurring relatively slowly. However, lesions observed in our experiments in the lungs might show that the virus is not eliminated quickly from the lungs because even at low concentrations it manages to cause lesions. The hypothesis about the primary role of intestinal tissue in the replication/accumulation and source of dissemination of IBV was suggested in our previous publications [1, 30] .",

The nasopharynx mucus layer (a porous gel net) acts as an impenetrable physical barrier to most pathogens. However, because the pore diameter of the gel net (approximately 500 nm) is significantly larger than the IB virus diameter (50-100 nm) [4] , the IB virus easily penetrates mucus pores. Once swallowed, the mucus is digested by the gastrointestinal system, and the virus starts to replicate. It is important to mention that the size of the SARS-CoV-2 virus (approximately 60-140 nm) [31] is close to the IB virus diameter (50-100 nm).",

These results agree with the fact that that the highest ACE2 expression in human organisms occurs in the intestinal enterocyte brush border [32, 33] . Although it was reported that ACE2 is expressed in the lung, liver, stomach, ileum, kidney, and colon, its expressing levels there are relatively low, especially in the lung.

The recent observations showed that gastrointestinal symptoms were observed in 57% of the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. In addition, these symptoms sometimes occurred without respiratory symptoms. Gastrointestinal manifestations are more common in patients with severe disease than in patients with non-severe disease. For approximately 48.1% of patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome COVID-19, a stool sample was positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA virus [35] .

For example, recently, Argovit was studied in vitro and in vivo to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in health workers. The inhibitory effect of AgNPs in SARS-CoV-2 NL/2020 strain replication in cultured Vero E6 cells was confirmed [46] . A randomized study (with 114 and 117 participants in experimental and control groups, respectively) demonstrated that mouthwash and nose rinse with 1% Argovit-C reduced the SARS-CoV-2 infection rate 16 times in healthcare personnel attending on average 169 patients with COVID-19 per week per person [47] . It was demonstrated that the silver nanocluster/silica composite coating deposited on facial masks possessed a virucidal effect against SARS-CoV-2 [29] . The investigation of blood serum samples collected from 51 healthcare workers of an Italian COVID-19 hospital showed that a higher concentration of C12 was observed in protected workers compared with those infected with SARS-CoV-2 [46] . The authors suggested a potential defensive role of monolaurin against SARS-CoV-2 infection. They offered a randomized controlled trial of monolaurin supplements to confirm these observational findings before any therapeutic recommendations can be made.",

Virucidal drugs are substances causing the inactivation of viral particles, thereby limiting the infection of new cells and preventing the damage of cells and body tissues. Silver nanoparticles should also be included in this class of drugs. Unlike classical antiviral drugs, for example, inhibitors of the activity of RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of coronaviruses (Areplivir, Remdesivir, etc.), virucidal drugs are not required to penetrate the cell to exert their virucidal effect. For this reason, the dosage of virucidal medicines may be less. Therefore, their toxic effect may be significantly less due to poor transport into cells (which reduces the risks of metabolic disorders).",

However, the inactivation of viral particles on the surface of mucous membranes (intestines, nasopharynx) with virucidal medications, combined with an intensive self-cleaning of the surfaces of mucous membranes, creates good prospects for limiting the entry of the SARS-CoV-2 virus into the blood and lymphatic vessels, followed by hematogenous and lymphomatous transport to the pulmonary circulation (lungs). The intensity of biosynthetic processes (such as virus replication) in the epithelium of mucous membranes is extremely high. Limiting the reproduction of the virus in the nasopharynx and intestine can have a systemic effect on the development of COVID-19.",
