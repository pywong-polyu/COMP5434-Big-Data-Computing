[3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In addition, failing to address patients' goals and values through ACP conversations is associated with more hospital use at the end of life, more burdensome interventions, less use of hospice and more difficult bereavement for families and caregivers.

[21] [22] [23] [24] [25] A growing body of literature suggests that some older adults with CKD and other comorbidities who progress to kidney failure may receive few benefits from dialysis and may experience a degradation in quality of life and functional status. [26] [27] [28] In addition, cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) appears to be particularly ineffective in older adults with advanced CKD and overall knowledge about CPR remains low in this population. 14 29 As such, experts and guidelines have called for increased efforts to improve on shared advance care planning and decision-making for older adults around initiation of dialysis and CPR preferences. [30] [31] [32] Further, medical treatments, such as dialysis, are often presented as necessary rather than a matter of personal preference while the option of medical management of kidney disease without dialysis is poorly described to patients, if at all. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] As a result, there is a call for research to develop and test tools to improve ACP and treatment decision-making among older adults with advanced CKD. 33 Traditional ACP and decision-making for patients rely on clinicians' ad hoc verbal or paper-based descriptions of treatment options as patients consider what preferences meet their unique goals. 34 39-41 This approach is limited because treatment decisions, such as those for dialysis, and medical management without dialysis options, and CPR are challenging to describe or may not be accessible to patients with limited literacy. Additionally, information provided to patients is variable and both verbal and paper explanations are hindered by literacy and language barriers. Patients often look to video media for information on CPR, 42 however, fictional video representations in popular media can sensationalise and misrepresent outcomes. 14 [43] [44] [45] [46] To address these shortcomings, we developed and tested a video decision aid to improve knowledge of kidney failure treatment options (including medical management without dialysis) among older patients with advanced CKD. 38 The tool, which is available in both English and Spanish, significantly improved knowledge of medical management without dialysis and participants also reported high satisfaction and acceptability ratings. 38 Video-based tools can improve decision making by providing visual information to capture complex medical and emotional scenarios and lead to increased ACP documentation. 47 48 Additionally, a growing body of evidence supports the effectiveness and feasibility of decision aids on decision-making outcomes among patients with various serious illnesses, including in kidney disease. 38 43 44 47-59 In this paper, we present the rationale, methodology and design of the Video Images about Decisions for Ethical Outcomes in Kidney Disease (VIDEO-KD) trial.",

The research assistant (RA) will review a list of scheduled patients 2 weeks prior to their clinic visit. Only established patients known to the nephrologist will be considered. Using the EHR, the RA will identify potential participants who meet our eligibility criteria. To conduct this screening procedure, a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) waiver of individual authorisation for disclosure of personal health information will be obtained. For those patients meeting the criteria, their nephrologist will then be notified by email to solicit their opinion as to whether the patient is otherwise appropriate to approach for participation based on the nephrologist's knowledge of the patient's clinical status, psychological disposition and decisionmaking capacity. They will also be asked to review their panel of patients for any patients meeting the Surprise Question criterion but not selected by the RA. When an appropriate patient is identified, they will either be mailed an opt-out recruitment letter and then called by phone for recruitment, or, if they are seen in the clinic in person, they will be asked by a member of their care team if they would like to speak with an RA to hear about the study. If the patient is amenable, the RA will administer the cognitive screening and schedule a time to administer the informed consent. The RA will then obtain informed consent (online supplemental file 1), which will be documented in accordance with each site's requirements for each mode (phone, video or in-person). The RA will verify the ability of the patient to provide consent by explaining the nature of the study and having the patient repeat (teach-back) the aims and risks of the study.

Family members and friends who might be present with the patient will be invited to remain during the survey if that is agreeable to the patient; however, all answers will be provided by the patient. After completing informed consent, the randomisation assignment is automated within the REDCap system, telling the RA in real time if the patient has been randomised to the intervention or control arm. 72 An analyst with the central research team created the randomisation scheme and uploaded it into REDCap so study staff can access it directly as part of patient enrolment.

The decision aid was designed using the internationally recognised decision aid criteria (International Patient Decision Aid Standards, http://ipdas.ohri.ca/). The proposed video decision aid for this study was certified by the Washington Health Care Authority and is the only decision aid currently certified in kidney disease (https://www. hca. wa.gov/about-hca/healthier-washington/patient-decision-aids-pdas). Additionally, the video was developed with content intended to be objective and balanced. It is scripted at a sixth-grade level of health literacy in both English and Spanish and has closed captioning.

For patients who die prior to 12 months, we will conduct an NLP-assisted EHR review to assess ACP documentation (primary outcome), type of kidney failure treatment received prior to death, receipt of palliative care, hospice, or CPR/intubation in the last month of life, and place of death (eg, intensive care unit, home, etc). NLP-assisted EHR review will rely on the ClinicalRegex software, which allows for rapid semi-automated clinical note review. ClinicalRegex presents operators with clinical notes highlighted in particular areas located by keywords associated with the concepts in question. Site operators will then ensure that keywords found within the notes appear in the correct clinical context (as in the documentation of ACP conversations). This method will be used at each site to search all collected outpatient Open access clinical documentation data from the EHR for ACP documentation, similar to prior studies using NLP. [83] [84] [85] For each NLP domain (ie, goals-of-care discussion, limitations to life-sustaining treatment), we have built a keyword library with the goal of identifying relevant documentation within clinical notes. Each keyword library will be refined and validated by the review of retrospective clinical notes in each site's local EHRs to generate formal metrics (accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, etc) across all sites. 86 All site operators who will be engaged in this NLP must participate in training on note annotation practices and must demonstrate proficiency in annotating notes containing clinical concepts expected to be found during this trial. Proficiency will be determined by the use of a calibration test consisting of 20 mock clinical narratives which will be used to cross-validate annotation practices across all sites.",

We will first estimate the impact of the video on longevity, quality of life and healthcare utilisation separately. Depending on these results, we will use cost-effectiveness analysis to compare the value of the services used between the two groups. 87 For our primary analysis we will use the perspective of the healthcare payer (Medicare). Using generalised Poisson regression models, we will separately estimate the average difference in quality of life and costs associated with the video arm relative to the control arm, expressed per 1 year of exposure time. Using generalised linear and survival models we will also examine longevity both as a dichotomous survival indicator (0/1) and as a continuous measure. We will adjust for systematic differences across hospitals using either a random or fixed effects specification. 88 We will use increment net benefit (INB) as the cost-effectiveness measure. 89 ",

For CKD preferences, the study will have 90% power to detect a difference of 46% of video participants choose medical management without dialysis vs 33% in the control arm estimated from our pilot study. Assuming 60% of video participants achieve preference concordance, the study will have 96% power to detect a 15% difference (60% vs 45%) and 84% power to detect a 12% difference (60% vs 48%). For continuous outcomes such as ACP engagement, the study will have 90% power to detect an effect size of 0.265% and 80% power to detect an effect size of 0.229. Both are considered as small to medium effect sizes. Figure 1 gives the sample sizes needed to distinguish utility differences of 0.01-0.03 between intervention and control participants with 80% power (alpha=0.05 and intracluster correlation=0.02). 82 89 91 For instance, with 10 institutions (total 10 clinics), 60 participants from each institution (N=600)-with half assigned to each armwill be adequate to distinguish 0.013 difference in utility between the two arms. A difference of 0.013 amounts to a 2.3% difference in utility based on the estimate of 0.56 utility level for patients on haemodialysis (using the Euro-Qol-5D instrument).
