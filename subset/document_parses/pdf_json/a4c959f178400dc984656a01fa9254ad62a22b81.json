Data scientists need to be equipped with skills to tackle the complexities of the societal context surrounding their data science work. In this paper, we offer insights into how to structure our data science classes so that they motivate students to deeply engage with material about societal context and lean into the types of conversations that will produce long-lasting growth in critical thinking skills. In particular, we describe a novel assessment tool called participation portfolios, which is motivated by a framework that promotes student autonomy, self reflection, and the building of a learning community. We compare students' participation before and after implementing this assessment tool, and our results suggest that this tool increased student participation and helped them move towards course learning objectives.",

Besides courses heavily loaded with statistics, computer science, and other technical data science content, there is a growing recognition of the importance of courses that teach, as our colleagues from Berkeley have said, students to be \"attentive to the social, cultural, and ethical contexts of the problems that they are formulating and aiming to solve\" (Adhikari, DeNero, & Jordan, 2021) . In other words, our educational approaches should encourage the students to treat data from and about humans with the same care that we expect in any other type of research involving human subjects.",

How can our courses help them to grow into stronger critical thinkers capable of considering the complexities of the human contexts surrounding their data science work? This is not just a question of what content and methods to include in our curriculum, but a consideration of the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations at play in our assignments and classroom environments. Too often students approach the development of critical thinking skills with a focus on points and grades (a textbook example of extrinsic motivation). However, the intellectual and personal skills at the heart of critical thinking are more effectively developed by appealing to intrinsic motivations.",

Courses like Data 104: Human Contexts and Ethics of Data at Berkeley (Adhikari, DeNero, and Jordan, 2021) and our own Applied Computation 221: Critical Thinking in Data Science (AC221) at Harvard present students with a selection of different perspectives through course readings, lectures, and exercises, but how do we get our students to make a habit of surfacing their underlying assumptions and confronting their implicit biases?

Overall, it helped create a community of learners who were motivated to collaborate, rather than to compete, with each other. And while we developed this framework for a discussion-heavy course like AC221, we believe ARC's utility goes beyond such courses; we are actively using it to create assignments and learning communities in a new, introductory programming class.",

Section 3 presents our revamped approach, and Section 4 introduces a pedagogical framework to foster student motivation. This framework helps to explain many of the reasons for the success of our new approach, and we have found it to be a useful template for creating success in other types of courses. Section 5 provides an overview of our research methodology by which we test the hypothesis that students' participation improved in Spring 2021. Section 6 presentes the results where we compare across years of pre-intervention and postintervention and indicators of success.

One of the authors (Smith) joined the course's teaching staff for the Spring 2020 offering, which was interrupted near the midpoint of the semester by the worldwide spread of COVID-19. With the cancellation of in-person instruction for the rest of that semester and Harvard's quick decision that all instruction for the entirety of the 2020-2021 academic year would be remote, we found ourselves in a unique position: From the forced transition in the Spring 2020 semester, we knew which aspects of the original, in-person course did not translate effectively to a remote learning environment. By knowing early in the summer of 2020 that we would have to teach remotely again in Spring 2021, we therefore had the time to address what had not worked well and adapt accordingly 2.1 Teaching critical thinking skills in data science AC221 is a masters-level course, and its content highlights the wide-ranging impact data science has on the world. Its goal is to allow, encourage students to grow, foster student's growth in their ability to think critically about such thorny issues as fairness, privacy, ethics, and bias when they are building algorithms and predictive models that are then released into the world in the form of products, policy, and scientific research.",

This gives the learners the opportunity to authentically reflect-a key component in learning-and is crucial for honing one's ability to apply the knowledge in real-life contexts (Herrington & Oliver, 2000) . Rote practice, on the other hand, is typically decontextualized and lacks productive feedback or coaching. Without timely and actionable feedback, practice becomes a suboptimal process for learning because it is too easy for mistakes to go unnoticed, be repeated, and become ingrained in our brains. And without reflection, practice becomes inefficient (i.e., we waste time focusing on what we already know rather than on those areas where we need to improve) and the individual gains remain ephemeral.

While prior research has attempted to operationally define participation, it fails to capture the underlying mechanism in which quality participation is indicated. Fassinger (1995) suggests that commenting on a topic and asking a question are the indicators that qualify students' activity as participation. This categorization captures the participation phenomenon at a superficial level, thus it fails to operationally define the underlying mechanism of a quality participation. For example, according to such operationalization of participation assessment, student comments such as \"I agree with Susie\" or questions such as \"Can you explain this topic?\" would be considered \"participation.\" However, we argue that such comments or questions do not necessarily qualify as high-quality participation because they do not demonstrate a level of elaboration (e.g., building on an argument) or extension of the discussion (e.g, providing a counter-argument to an existing one).

As instructors, we would have to grade and provide feedback now seven times (for this instance of AC221). While this was a real cost borne by the instructors, we found the work enjoyable.

Therefore, it is critical to design assignments in a way that they enhance students' sense of autonomy (e.g.., November, 2012) . Stefanou et al., (2013) explored perceived autonomy in courses that require higher-level thinking and concluded that students reported the autonomy support that they received from the instructor led them to be independent thinkers. Research shows that course design interventions that foster autonomy led students perceive more ownership over their learning, leading to numerous positive outcomes such as persistence and educational achievements (Vansteenkiste et al., 2004; Guay & Vallerand, 1996; Yu & Bristol, 2020; Bao & Lam, 2008) .

This then fed upon itself as the students began to seek out the types of participation that would lead to meaningful discussions. As a result, students began to see value in listening to each other, challenging each others' assumptions and views, and answering each others' questions.",

The quality scores were computed for the discussions that include more than one comment. Part of the difference in total comments and total discussions betweens semesters is due to the difference in enrollments between the 2020 and 2021 course offerings. 66 students were enrolled in Spring 2020 and 41 in Spring 2021. We believe, although we cannot prove, that another significant contributor to the difference was that the 2021 students knew that they did not have to comment on every Perusall assignment.",

The instructors had informed the students in both years that Perusall was a student space. The instructors would read the conversations that took place in that space and use that information to tailor the subsequent class time (e.g., to skip topics well understood by the students or focus more intently on topics misunderstood by them). The instructors would not be monitoring the space to \"correct\" student views or make sure that the \"right\" points were raised in the discussions.",
