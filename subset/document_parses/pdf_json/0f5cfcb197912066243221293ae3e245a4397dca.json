To drastically improve dexamethasone loading and prevent burst release once injected intravenously, a lipophilic prodrug dexamethasone palmitate (DXP) was encapsulated into poly(DL-lactide-co-glycolide)-polyethylene glycol (PLGA-PEG) nanoparticles (NPs). DXP-loaded PLGA-PEG NPs (DXP-NPs) of about 150 nm with a drug loading as high as 7.5% exhibited low hemolytic profile and cytotoxicity. DXP-NPs were able to inhibit the LPS-induced release of inflammatory cytokines in macrophages. After an intravenous injection to mice, dexamethasone (DXM) pharmacokinetic profile was also significantly improved. The concentration of DXM in the plasma of healthy mice remained high up to 18 h, much longer than the commercial soluble drug dexamethasone phosphate (DSP). Biodistribution studies showed lower DXM concentrations in the liver, kidneys, and lungs when DXP-NPs were administered as compared with the soluble drug. Histology analysis revealed an improvement in the knee structure and reduction of cell infiltration in animals treated with the encapsulated DXP compared with the soluble DSP or non-treated animals. In summary, the encapsulation of a lipidic prodrug of dexamethasone into PLGA-PEG NPs appears as a promising strategy to improve the pharmacological profile and reduce joint inflammation in a murine model of rheumatoid arthritis.",

However, when administered intravenously, their unfavorable pharmacokinetics (PK), the high doses needed to reach a therapeutic effect, and the associated side effects have limited their prescription on a chronic basis [3] . Nevertheless, the therapeutic use of GC could greatly benefit from their delivery by NPs. Indeed, if NPs possess a prolonged blood circulation time, they could benefit from the extravazation through leaky vasculature and the subsequent inflammatory cell-mediated sequestration (ELVIS) effect to accumulate into inflamed tissues, release GCs, and therefore reduce the dose needed and all the associated side effects [4] .",

The prodrug needs to be hydrolyzed into DXM by esterases, which are present in the site of inflammation, to release the active drug. DXP is commercialized as a phospholipid emulsion, named Limethason\u00ae [10] . The advantage of encapsulation is the avoidance of DXP crystal formation [9] . However, this formulation has shown a short to medium sustained release in healthy volunteers and patients with inflammatory osteoarthritis, with redistribution into the systemic circulation of 90% of the drug within 48 h after the intra-articular administration [9, 11] . Liposomes were also explored as nanocarriers for DXP, but they have shown many drawbacks such as short residence time in the inflamed joints [11, 12] , low encapsulation efficiency, and poor stability [13] .",

After removal of free DXP, nanoparticles were characterized for size, polydispersity index (PDI), and zeta potential. All NPs had an average size of approximately 150 nm, with a PDI around 0.1, indicative of a highly homogenous formulation, and a negative zeta potential (\u2212 25 to \u2212 28 mV) (Fig. 1A) . The homogeneity of the DXP-NPs was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM; Fig. 1B) and their shape was spherical. The size of about 150 nm, and the low PdI, makes the NPs adequate for an intravenous treatment and a passive delivery in the inflamed tissues through extravasation via leaky vasculature followed by inflammatory cell sequestration (ELVIS) [20] . The high negative charge allows a more stable colloidal suspension, avoiding the coalescence and aggregation of the NPs due to the electrostatic repulsion between them. Indeed, the stability of DXP-NPs stored at 4 \u00b0C was monitored for more than 1 month by measuring the size and the PdI of both unloaded and DXP-NPs (10 mg initial DXP) (Supporting information Figure S1 ). Both formulations were stable for up to 30 days without the appearance of any drug crystals that could be observed under the optical microscope. Encapsulation efficiency and drug loading were measured by HPLC. The drug loading followed a linear behavior (Fig. 1C) , and the encapsulation efficiency went up to 85% for low DXP amount and down to 75% for high DXP amount. The DXP was encapsulated into PLGA-PEG NPs with high encapsulation efficiency and good drug loading. The non-encapsulated drug could easily be removed using 5% SDS and removing the supernatant after ultracentrifugation. The encapsulation efficiency of the DXP into PLGA-PEG NPs and the removal of the non-encapsulated drug were much better than for DXM [5] or dexamethasone acetate [6] , with, for the latest, an efficiency of about 3% and the formation of crystals in the NP suspension by the nonencapsulated drug. Besides, in the DXM and dexamethasone acetate formulations, there was a rapid saturation when the initial amount of GC was increased while, in the case of the DXP, the encapsulation was linear up to the highest concentration tested (20 mg/mL). As a compromise between good encapsulation efficiency and high drug loading, the remaining experiments were conducted with DXP-NPs formulated with an initial mass of 10 mg DXP; these NPs named DXP-NPs hereby exhibit a drug loading of 7.5% w/w.",

DXP-NPs were highly internalized by the macrophages, which are the main immune cells recruited in the inflamed tissues and the main ones responsible for the cytokine release [21] . However, the internalization in the macrophages was slow due to the presence of the PEG at the NP surface [22] [23] [24] [25] . Despite this slow internalization, PEG is necessary to benefit from long circulation in the bloodstream and accumulation in inflamed tissues thanks to the ELVIS effect [20] . It could be an advantage to allow a more specific targeting to the inflamed cells by avoiding a rapid internalization by the cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system (MPS) [25] [26] [27] .",

Only in the positive control and in the samples with LPS which were not able to inhibit the cytokine release, the concentration was above the detection limit. DXP-NPs were able to inhibit the cytokines in a significant manner. At a dose of 10 \u00b5g/mL of DXP, the inhibition was significant concerning the positive control for all the cytokines tested ( Fig. 3) and similar to the inhibition induced by an equivalent DSP concentration. The unloaded NPs were only able to slightly inhibit IL-10 and IL-6 to a much lower extent than the DXP-NPs. This very surprising result might arise from nonspecific interactions between cytokines and NPs.

This proves the efficiency of the encapsulated drug because the inhibition of the inflammatory cytokines is one of the main anti-inflammatory pharmacological activities of the GC [40] . Besides, GCs induce the expression of anti-inflammatory proteins such as Annexin I (also called lipocortine-1) and MAPK phosphatase 1 through the binding in the DNA to the glucocorticoid-responsive elements (GRE) [41] . Other anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive mechanisms of the GC are the inhibition of several transcription factors, such as NF-kB and AP1, and the interaction with other second messengers, such as the PI3K-Akt-eNOS that induces the release of nitric oxide [41] . Because some of those mechanisms are also involved in physiologic signaling, prolonged use or high doses of GC have significant side effects [41] . Thus, GC formulations with more targeted delivery, together with an improvement of the PK and the use of lower doses, would be beneficial for the treatment of inflammatory diseases.",

Two hours after injection, the concentration of both DXP and DXM started to decrease. However, it remained always higher than the DXM concentration from DSP up to 18 h post-injection, which is indicative of a sustained release of the drug from the NPs. Eighteen hours after injection, the concentration of both compounds became similar to the DXM concentration in animals injected with the commercial DSP. In general, the concentration of DXP and DXM was similar during all the pharmacokinetics in animals injected with the DXP-NPs which is indicative of an equilibrium between the inactive and the active form of the drug. A similar pharmacokinetic profile was also observed with a lipophilic nanoformulation of the drug consisting of the formation of DXP NPs stabilized by distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-[methoxy(poly(ethylene glycol))-2000] (DSPE-PEG2000) [14] . However, the DXP concentration decreased faster and the DXM concentration was higher in the lipophilic NPs, probably due to a higher exposure to esterases leading to faster degradation of the prodrug into the active DXM form [14] . On the contrary, here the prodrug is more embedded within the PLGA matrix that slows its release and subsequent degradation by esterases.",

            "text": "A non-compartmental analysis was used to compare the pharmacokinetic behavior of DXM in the plasma of animals injected with DXP-NPs or DSP. The PK parameters were summarized in Table 1 . For DXP-NPs the maximum concentration (C max ) was about 4 times higher than for DSP and it was reached after 2 h (T max ), while for DSP the C max was reached 10 min after the administration of the drug and, after 2 h, the concentration started to decrease. The clearance (Cl) was much faster for the soluble drug (0.0073 mL/ min) than for the encapsulated DXP (0.0041 mL/min) and the volume of distribution of the drug (V d ) was about 6 times higher for DSP. The V d is the apparent volume in which a drug is distributed. Hence, the encapsulated drug is not distributed from blood to other organs and/or eliminated as fast as the soluble drug which confirms the capacity of NPs to stay longer in the bloodstream. Although the prodrug loading is much lower for DXP-NPs than for the lipophilic nanoformulation (7.5 vs 50% w/w), the use of PLGA-PEG for the encapsulation of the prodrug avoid the initial burst release observed in the lipophilic NPs, in which the C max was reached 10 min after administration, like in the soluble drug [14] . Besides, the polymer encapsulation reduced the V d about 3 times in comparison with the lipophilic nanoformulation and the conversion of the prodrug into the active drug, indicating a more protected and sustained release of the GC. The area under the curve for the measured kinetics (AUC 0-1080 ) was about 3.6 times higher for the encapsulated drug than the soluble drug, and the AUC extrapolated to the infinite (AUC 0-\u221e ) was almost 1.8 times than for the soluble drug. Similar values were also obtained for lipophilic nanoformulation, indicative of a higher exposure of the drug in animals injected with the encapsulated prodrug in comparison with the DSP formulation. Contrary, the half-life (t 1/2 ) in the plasma and the MRT were superior for the soluble drug, but this could be due to the plateau observed for DSP, as described before [14] .",

In both groups, DXM accumulated mainly in the liver. This accumulation was higher for the soluble drug (DSP), reaching almost 30% of the injected dose, while for the encapsulated drug was always inferior to 20%. The opposite was observed for the other organs studied. The encapsulated drug reached higher concentrations, mainly in the spleen, with an accumulation of almost 6% compared to less than 0.5% in the commercial drug. A higher accumulation of DPX and DXM in the spleen, in comparison with the soluble drug, was also observed for the lipophilic nanoformulation but not in the kidney or lungs [14] . There were some differences in the kinetics of the drug in the liver and spleen between NPs and DSP. While for DSP the concentration decreased all the time, for DXP-NPs the concentration increased up to 8 h and then decreased until the end of the pharmacokinetics, according to a slower clearance from the plasma (Fig. 4 ). Yet, for the lung and kidneys, the concentration of the drug decreased for both formulations. The preferential accumulation in the liver and spleen is a common feature for most particles in the nanometer range due to their rapid internalization by resident macrophages of the MPS and the fenestrated epithelia of these organs [42] . This accumulation depends on particle size, among other properties, i.e., particles in the range of 50-100 nm and 200-500 nm are mainly accumulated in the liver and spleen, respectively, while particles in the micrometer range accumulate preferentially in the lungs [43] . For that reason, monodisperse nanostructures with a size of 100-200 nm are preferred for intravenous administration, such as in the case of DXP-NPs.",

The same trend was observed for kidneys, and in the liver and spleen after reaching the maximum concentration. Therefore, all the organs studied were able to clear the GC and avoid long-term accumulation. Besides, the GC was mainly accumulated as the prodrug (DXP) in animals injected with the DXP-NPs, probably due to a lack of esterases in the healthy tissues that catalyze the degradation of the PLGA NPs and metabolize the prodrug into the active drug. This could be an advantage compared to the soluble or encapsulated DXM form because the prodrug is not active and it would avoid the undesirable effects associated with the use of GC in those organs.",

The treatments or PBS were administered three times every other day starting at day 32 after the first immunization and the animals were sacrificed at day 38. For the DXP-NPs and DSP group, the equivalent DXM dose injected was 1 mg/kg each time. Figure 6 shows how the animals treated with DXP-NPs were able to reduce both the arthritic score of the disease from 8 to 1 and the paw volume from 0.1935 mL to basal levels (0.1385 mL) compared with PBS-treated animals (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the animals treated with DSP also reduced significantly both parameters compared to the untreated animals (p < 0.05 and p < 0.001, respectively), but the therapeutic efficacy of the DXP-NPs was higher than that of DSP. Although the difference in the reduction of the paw volume was not statistically significant, the decrease of the arthritis score was more relevant for the encapsulated drug compared to the soluble DSP (p < 0.01). Hence, the therapeutic efficacy of the encapsulated GC is higher than that of the soluble drug at the dose of 1 mg/kg DXM, in agreement with the results obtained for the lipophilic nanoformulation [15] . Moreover, the reduction of the arthritic score is more significant for DXP-NPs in comparison with the lipophilic nanoformulation at the same dose (p < 0.01 vs p < 0.05), in agreement with the more sustained GC release and slower clearance from the blood. The results confirmed the efficiency of PLGA-PEG NPs to deliver a therapeutic drug in the inflamed tissues in rheumatoid arthritis, likely due to the leaky vasculature and the angiogenesis that occurs in the inflamed joints and the associated ELVIS effect [20] . Indeed, the capacity of DXP-NPs to undergo extravazation and accumulation in the inflamed joints was demonstrated for lipophilic nanoformulation, with a size of 130 nm, by using fluorescent labeling [14] .",

This formulation appears as a relevant strategy for the development of future therapeutic approaches in the treatment of RA using novel and more disease-specific drugs.",

This formulation was stable for about 1 month and showed a spherical shape, a homogeneous size, and a negative zeta potential similar to the unloaded PLGA-PEG NPs. DXP-NPs were highly internalized by a macrophage cell line and were able to inhibit the release of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. Moreover, the unloaded and DXP-loaded NPs were not toxic for those cells and not able to induce hemolysis. The formulation also exhibited a better pharmacokinetic profile than the soluble drug with a sustained drug release. The concentration in plasma after injection in healthy animals remained high up to 18 h, much longer than the commercial soluble drug, and the DXP-loaded NPs accumulated in the organs mainly as the prodrug. The therapeutic efficacy of DXP-NPs was also increased significantly compared with the soluble drug. The arthritis score and the paw volume after the injection of three doses of the treatment were much lower than those obtained with soluble DSP. Moreover, some inflammatory cytokines were also reduced significantly after 37 days compared with non-treated and DSP-treated animals. Besides, the histological damage and cell infiltration were also reduced better by DXP-NPs. In summary, DXP-NPs have proven to be a good formulation for a more rational delivery of DXM that could be used in inflammatory diseases such as RA.",
