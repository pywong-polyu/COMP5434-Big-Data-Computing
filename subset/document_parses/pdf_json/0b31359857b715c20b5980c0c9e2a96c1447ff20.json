We define the information's injuriousness as the people practicing the information being injured and leaving the system. Some informed people practice the information and are active, while others do not practice and are inactive. With the recovery resources fixed, the two groups of informed people's recovering rates are normalized considering the information features. The stability of the nonlinear system is thoroughly studied. Analyzing the reproduction number of the injurious information, we find that in general parameter space, when there are people in an informed compartment, it is not always necessary to consider their recovery resource allocation. Instead, only when their proportion reaches a critical point should it be allocated. Unless the people in an informed compartment form a certain proportion, we can take a laissez-faire attitude towards them. In a more realistic parameter space, once inactive informed people exist, they should be allocated recovery resources. On the one hand, when the recovering rate rises, the focus on both groups of informed people is necessary for more situations. On the other hand, when the rate of active informed people leaving the system rises, ignoring active informed people benefits removing the injurious information in more cases. The model provides qualitative ways in the scenarios of removing injurious information.",

            "text": "McKendrick [1] first proposed an SIR compartment model depicting epidemic propagation. In the classical SIR model, according to the heterogeneity of people's state of the epidemic, the well-mixed population is divided into three compartments: susceptible (S), infected (I), and recovered (R). Assuming the infection rate is \u03b1, the recovering rate is \u03c9. Then, in a unit time, there are \u03b1SI susceptible becoming infected, and \u03c9I infected becoming recovered. The SIR model being not suitable for all kinds of epidemics, a variety of classical epidemic models (e.g., the SEIR model) were proposed concerning the characteristics of different epidemics. In the classical SEIR model, compartment E is exposed, and after infection, the susceptible will not immediately have infectivity but will be exposed first. Although the mathematical form of compartment models seems simple, the research on their deep mathematical essence has never been interrupted. For instance, in 2020, the accurate solutions of the SIR epidemic model [2] [3] [4] and the SEIR epidemic model are found [5] . In general, the compartment models are usually idealized. While some works are data-driven [6] , most of others can guide some epidemic prevention and control problems in the real world only at the qualitative level but without real data [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

With the development of modern control theory, it is incorporated into the research framework of nonlinear dynamics. For the local stability, van den Driessche and Watmough [11] proposed a general method for finding the basic reproduction number, which can be used to judge the local stability of the epidemic-free equilibrium. Lyapunov's Second Method and Lasalle's Invariance Principle [12, 13] are essential mathematical tools for global stability analysis. The global stability of the classical SEIR model was analyzed by Li et al. [14, 15] . Various additional mechanisms were then implemented to the SEIR model with the global stability completely analyzed; for example, the immigration of different compartments [16] , the nonlinear transmission rate [17, 18] , the distributed delays [18] , the discontinuous treatment [19] , the agedependent latency and relapse [20] , the non-monotone incidence rates [21] [22] [23] . Global stability analysis was also carried out in epidemic models with real backgrounds [24, 25] . Some literature has summarized the general global stability analysis methods for several classical compartment models [26, 27] .",

In 1964, Daley and Kendall [28] compared the similarities between epidemics and rumors and proposed to use the epidemic compartment model to describe the spread of rumors. Based on the classical compartment of rumor propagation, a series of mechanisms were investigated. For example, Zhao et al. [29, 30] implemented the mechanism of forgetting rate to rumor spreading model, Wan et al. [31] studied the rumor propagation model with demographics on scale-free networks, Hu et al. [32, 33] built rumor spreading models considering different reactions of different people towards rumors, and Xiao et al. [34] combined the rumor spreading model with evolutionary games. In the study of rumor propagation, the stability analysis of the compartment models was also detailly carried out [31] [32] [33] . Like modeling the rumor spreading, Galam and Javarone [35] modeled the phenomena of radicalization in heterogeneous populations. Similarly, Chuang et al. [36, 37] investigated a bistable belief system for radicalization within sectarian conflict [36] and the impact of age-structured social interactions on radicalization [37] . Santoprete et al. [38] [39] [40] created a series of compartment models to study the strategy of de-radicalization. In the study of the process of radicalization, stability analysis was carried out [35, 39, 40] . In the framework of a nonlinear continuous system [41] or discrete system [42] , the compartment model can describe the propagation of general information, ideology, or opinion as long as it has a similar law transmission.",

A similarity and a difference between the propagation of information and epidemics are respectively considered. First, we label the information discussed in the paper as \"injurious information.\" Similar to epidemics, its injuriousness lies in the dynamical characteristics that the people who are informed flow out of the system. For example, in influenza pandemics, the information of advocating the harmfulness of vaccines causes the informed people who practice the information (choose not to vaccinate) to be injured in health, thus flowing out of the system (e.g., hospitalization or death). On the contrary, the other part of the population may not practice this type of information (still choose to vaccinate), even if they are informed. Most medically relevant opinions or rumors can be considered in this category. For instance, opinions such as violent extremism and terrorism can also be considered in this category, whose practitioners may leave the system because of their own deaths or because of social isolation (treatment by law enforcement). As described above, this paper considers the different practical attitudes of people to injurious information. It divides them into active informed (those who practice the information) and inactive informed (those who do not practice it), and this distinction between the two depends on the population properties, including but not limited to the age structure and education level.",

For the recovery process of epidemics, the use of medical resources (e.g., ventilators) is restricted to the number of people; therefore, the number of people using medical resources per unit time (i.e., the recovering rate multiplied by the number of infected people) is constant. The normalization of the recovering rate among heterogeneous infected people is meaningless. But, concerning information spreading, the recovering rate of heterogeneous informed people turning into recovered people can be normalized. This is because that, the popularization of knowledge to the public by the government public welfare organization or folk media is based on platforms such as the Internet or other traditional media; therefore, there is no extra cost for promoting recovery resources (e.g., rumor refutation notice) to more people. Unlike in the epidemic treatment, the medical resources for a certain number of infected people correspond to a certain amount of cost, in the injurious information removing, it is the recovering rate for a particular group of people on the information platform that corresponds to a certain amount of cost. Then, in the exposure of recovery resources to the crowd, we need to consider the push to different groups of people, not to a fixed number of people. In other words, assuming fixed recovery resources, the recovering rate between different groups is normalized.",

            "text": "In this subsection, we further illustrate the results of theoretical analysis by numerical results. The numerical results are acquired by the forward-Euler difference method as several similar works did [7, 41] . We fix the step of time evolution as \u0394t = 10 \u22122 , and when t = \u0394t, we set the initial conditions S = 30, E = 0, I + = 5, I \u2212 = 5, R = 0. The system evolves from t = 10 \u22122 to t = 10 \u22124 . We complete the calculation and produce all figures by Matlab 2016a in Windows 10. First, we set the system parameters \u039b = 2, \u03bc = 0.05, d = 0.9, \u03b1 = 0.05, \u03c6 = 0.3, \u03c9 = 0.8, p = 1, q = 1, and the time evolution of system (1) is shown in Fig 2. From Eq (12) , it is calculated that R 0 \ufffd 0:9796 < 1. According to Theorem 3.1.1, the information-free equilibrium C \ufffd is locally asymptotically stable, and according to Theorem 3.2.1, the information-endemic equilibrium C \ufffd\ufffd is not stable. Through Eq (6), we have C \ufffd = (S \ufffd ,E \ufffd ,I + \ufffd ,I \u2212 \ufffd ,R \ufffd ) T = (\u039b/\u03bc, 0,0,0,0) T = (40,0,0,0,0) T , which is consistent with the numerical result of time evolution in Fig 2. In addition, when t = 10 \u22124 , we have S+E+I + +I \u2212 +R = 40\ufffd\u039b/\u03bc, which further validates Proposition 2.1. Secondly, we set the system parameters \u039b = 2, \u03bc = 0.05, d = 0.9, \u03b1 = 0.05, \u03c6 = 0.3, \u03c9 = 0.8, p = 0.4, q = 0.4, and the time evolution of system (1) is shown in Fig 3. From Eq (12) , it is calculated that R 0 \ufffd 2:4806 > 1. According to Theorem 3.1.1, the information-free equilibrium C \ufffd is not stable, and according to Theorem 3.2.1, the information-endemic equilibrium C \ufffd\ufffd is locally asymptotically stable. Through Eq (18), we have S \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd 16.1249, E \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd 3.4107, I + \ufffd \ufffd 0.3223, I \u2212 \ufffd \ufffd 1.1584, R \ufffd \ufffd 13.1828, which is consistent with the numerical result of time evolution in Fig 3. Moreover, when t = 10 4 , we have S+E+I + +I \u2212 +R \ufffd 34.1991\ufffd\u039b/\u03bc, which is also consistent with Proposition 2.1.",

Instead of the idealized analytical solution, as qualitative analysis, we further ask: should it pay more attention to both groups of people, or only focus on one compartment? From Eqs (32) and (34), it is easy to know p (0) >0 and p (1) <1. Considering 0\ufffdp\ufffd1, it shows that, with regard to the different proportion of active informed people, there is not only the situation that both groups of people should be considered but also the situation that only one compartment need emphasized. It is found that, when active informed people exist, it should not always consider their recovery resources allocation (p (0) >0), but only when their proportion reaches the critical point p (0) . As the same, when inactive informed people exist, it should not always consider their recovery resources allocation (p (1) <1), but only when their proportion reaches the critical point (1\u2212p (1) ).

For instance, the natural mortality of population \u03bc, whose value is usually minimal, is a secondary parameter in the information transmission scenarios we study; therefore, let us say, \u03bc = 0.01. In the scenarios of information propagation, the recovering rate \u03c9, and the rate of the active informed people leaving the system d are the main parameters we are concerned about. Therefore, in general, there should be \u03c9\ufffd\u03bc, d\ufffd\u03bc. Fig 4 demonstrates the optimal proportion of recovery resources q 0 assigned to the active informed people as a function of p, when \u03bc = 0.01. Considering \u03c9\ufffd\u03bc, d\ufffd\u03bc in Eq (34), we have p (1) !1 \u2212 , which means that, the critical point of the proportion of inactive people is very low, almost once there are some inactive informed people, they should be allocated recovery resources. As seen in Fig 4, p (1) is very close to 1. Fig 4A shows the situation when \u03c9 = 0.6, d = 0.2, and Fig 4B illustrates that when \u03c9 = 0.2, d = 0.6. According to Eq (32), we have p (0) !1 + , when w\ufffdd; and, we have p (0) !1 \u2212 , when w\ufffdd. In other words, when the recovering rate of the population is much higher than the rate of active informed people leaving the system, the critical point of the proportion of active people is low. Once there are some active informed people, they should be allocated recovery resources (Fig 4A) . When the rate of active informed people leaving the system is much higher than the recovering rate of the population, the critical point of the proportion of active people is greater, and only when there are a certain number of active informed people should they be allocated recovery resources (Fig 4B) .",

The injuriousness or symptom of the injurious information is defined as the people who practice the information being harmed and leaving the system. We assumed a proportion of informed people practice the information, while other informed people do not practice. Unlike previous studies on rumor or extremism, the difference between the two groups of informed people lies in whether they practice the information, not whether they accept it. The information resources are different from the medical resources; therefore, given the recovery resources, the two groups' recovering rate is normalized. By the basic reproduction number [11], the Jacobian matrix, and Lyapunov's Second Method [12, 13] , we gave the proposed nonlinear system complete stability analysis.",

Different from our intuition, when active informed people exist (0<p\ufffdp (0) ), it is not always necessary to consider their recovery resource allocation (q 0 = 0). Only when its proportion achieves a critical point p (0) , should the recovery resources be allocated. The same conclusion applies to inactive informed people in the available parameter space. In common sense, it is significant to prevent the injurious information or the epidemic at the outset, or \"guard against the minute.\" However, as the analysis reveals, unless a group of informed people form a certain proportion, we can take a laissez faire attitude towards them. With the further consideration of the parameters' practical significance, the critical point of the proportion of inactive people tends to 0; that is, almost once there are some inactive informed people, they should be allocated recovery resources. Moreover, the critical point of the proportion of active people is related to the informed people's recovering rate and the rate of active informed people leaving the system. When the informed people's recovering rate rises, we need to focus on both groups of informed people in a greater parameter range. When the rate of active informed people leaving the system rises, the parameter interval ignoring active informed people becomes larger. Although the simple idealized model cannot predict accurate data for a specific problem, it draws heuristic qualitative conclusions in the scenarios of removing injurious information.",
