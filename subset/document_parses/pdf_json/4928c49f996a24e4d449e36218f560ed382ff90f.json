It is mainly responsible for both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms but there is no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 faecaleoral transmission to date [2] . A recent research letter suggested a possible cross-transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between nine patients via bathing in a public bath centre [3] , underlining the need to implement specific measures to prevent this risk. In the context of progressive hospital activities recovery, we assessed the risk of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in rehabilitation pools and therapeutic water environments in order to protect patients and healthcare workers from COVID-19. To do so, we reviewed the current literature on SARS-CoV-2 sustainability in water environments. We also made an overview on risk and likely causes of viral crosstransmission in swimming pools. The different methods for swimming pool water disinfection in order to maintain its microbiological quality were described. According to this risk assessment strategy, we proposed pragmatic recommendations to control the risk of SARS-CoV-2 cross-transmission while preserving essential rehabilitation care for patients.",

SARS-CoV-2 survival conditions in biological fluids are not transposable to recreational water and there are no current data on SARS-CoV-2 stability in water environments such as swimming pools. However, coronaviruses seem instable in water environments and are very sensitive to chlorine [4] . Enveloped viruses including influenza viruses and coronaviruses, are too sensitive to environment and too rapidly inactivated in water to be transmitted within swimming pools; this is converse to naked viruses such as adenoviruses, noroviruses, enteroviruses or hepatitis A virus, which are usually more resistant and able to survive several days in water, even when treated with biocides such as chlorine, ozone or bromide [4, 5] . Accordingly, water from swimming pools does not appear favourable for the survival of SARS-CoV-2.",

Ingestion by the oral route remains the most frequent route of viral transmission in water, but the ocular mucosa may also be an important portal of entry for SARS-CoV-2 [8, 9] , possibly contributed to by irritation caused by chemical products used for disinfecting water. Skin lesions (injury, barrier disruption) may also allow viral entry, possibly contributed to by the skin softening that occurs with prolonged immersion in water; however, this mode of transmission has not been demonstrated for SARS-CoV-2.",

We propose here a range of specific measures for pools used for rehabilitation care to protect bathers and healthcare workers from SARS-CoV-2 (Table I) . Ensuring safety begins with reviewing clinical records to ensure that patients have no symptoms of COVID-19, followed by use of barrier precautions and social distancing, especially in dressing rooms. Indeed, the main risk of SARS-CoV-2 cross-transmission is through respiratory droplets and contact with contaminated surfaces, and strict application of barrier measures is the best way to prevent transmission.
