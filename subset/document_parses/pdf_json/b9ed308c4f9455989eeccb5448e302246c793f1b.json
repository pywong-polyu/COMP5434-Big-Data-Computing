            "text": "In 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) estimated that approximately 5.8 million individuals were diagnosed with TB disease, with 1.5 million deaths (including those co-infected with HIV). These numbers may be underreported, as the COVID-19 pandemic has led to an underdiagnosis of TB cases, which will likely lead to increased spread of TB infection (TBI) and disease. 1 It is estimated that one quarter of the global population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). 2 Transmission of Mtb is predominantly through the respiratory route: bacilli generated by infectious individuals when coughing, speaking, singing, sneezing, and even breathing are acquired by contacts who inhale droplet nuclei of 1-5 lm. 3, 4 Mtb infection may be rapidly cleared by the innate immune response, or infection may occur leading to either a TB infection TBI, or to TB disease. 5, 6 An estimated 20-25% of individuals become infected following exposure to Mtb. Among these individuals, the risk of TB disease within the first 5 years is 5-15%. 7 The innate and adaptive immune systems of an infected person control the replication of the pathogen. 8 Different risk/predisposing factors can play a role in Mtb progression, including coinfection with HIV or other pathogens (e.g., measles and possibly SARS-CoV-2), young age, comorbidities (e.g., diabetes mellitus [DM] , renal insufficiency and malignancies), genetic factors (e.g., primary immunodeficiencies), malnutrition, immunosuppression with biological agents (e.g., anti-tumour necrosis factor-a agents), harmful habits (e.g., smoking, substance abuse, harmful use of alcohol) and solid organ and haematological transplantation. 5, [9] [10] [11] [12] The management of TBI is described under Pillar One of the WHO's End TB Strategy (Integrated, patientcentred care and prevention) and is a core intervention in pursuit of TB elimination. [13] [14] [15] Our aim is to define the clinical and public health standards for TBI management.",

Forty-one experts provided valid answers after one reminder. The final panel included TB clinicians (n \u00bc 17), TB public health specialists (n \u00bc 15), TB paediatricians (n \u00bc 4), microbiologists/biologists (n \u00bc 3) and methodologists (n \u00bc 2). A 5-point Likert scale was used (5: high agreement; 1: low agreement). At the first Delphi round, agreement was high, with a median value of 4-5 for all standards, except for the public health standard (Standard 8). The agreement (defined as score 3) was over 95% for all standards and 73% for the public health standard. Based on substantial agreement on the Standards and on the document outline, a draft document was jointly developed by the expert panel, reducing the original 11 standards to eight.

[22] [23] [24] An individual with respiratory TB disease generates infectious droplet nuclei, the number of which depends on the cough strength, presence of lung cavities, sputum viscosity and ventilation. 3, 9 The contact needs to inhale infectious droplet nuclei, each containing at least one inhaled viable and virulent Mtb bacillus (via one or more exposures), which must reach the alveolar macrophages in the lung to become infected. To interrupt this chain of exposure, it is crucial that the source patient receives prompt and effective TB treatment and that appropriate infection control measures are in place. Rigorous monitoring of the different steps in the cascade of care is further elaborated in Standard 8.",

To adequately inform the individual and obtain the individual's consent to TBI management (see also Standard 8) , the difference between TB disease and TBI should be explained, highlighting that effective TPT reduces the risk of progression from TBI to TB disease.

These tests identify people who were infected with Mtb in the past or at present by measuring the immune response to the bacilli (Table 3) . However, there is a 6-8-week conversion window for these tests; therefore, a reliable assessment cannot be made within 2 months of the last infectious exposure. Both TST and IGRAs identify individuals who are at risk of progression to TB disease and are equally recommended for TBI testing. 27 Advantages and disadvantages are outlined in Table 3 . The use of IGRAs is recommended for individuals who have been vaccinated with bacilli Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG) and would therefore crossreact to tuberculin; for those aged 5 years; and in settings where a cold chain cannot be maintained, as reagents for TST are temperature-sensitive. 9, 20, 28 Limitations of TST include the need for two consecutive healthcare visits, the requirement for skilled personnel for TST application and analysis of the result at 48-72 h, and the recommended use of different cut-off points for TST positivity in various target populations, which makes interpretation more complex. However, IGRAs require phlebotomy, which requires a relatively large volume of blood from children, advanced laboratory equipment and technical expertise. Although more expensive than the TST, IGRAs require just one healthcare visit instead of two visits at specified time points, and are not observer-dependent, as these provide an objective result based on an internal control. 9, 20 Newer and cheaper tests for TBI testing are needed to overcome the issues described. Newer skin tests and simplified IGRAs have been developed, but data on their performance are currently limited. 9, 27, 29, 30 There is provisional evidence on the performance of a lateral flow assay, which is a potential point-of-care test (compared to the commercially available IGRAs for both immunocompetent and immunocompromised patients), but it has not yet been endorsed by the WHO.

As a result, it is critical to ensure that TB disease is absent before commencing TPT to avoid undertreating TB disease and to eliminate the possibility of developing drug resistance (which would require treatment with a minimum of three, and preferably four effective WHO-recommended TB drugs). 34 Screening for the four symptoms of cough, fever, weight loss and/or night sweats is the first key step in adults and adolescents, including patients living with HIV/AIDS (PLHA) regardless of antiretroviral treatment (ART) status. 20, 35, 36 For infants and children living with HIV/AIDS and/or in contact with a person with infectious TB disease, screening for poor weight gain (failure to thrive) or weight loss, reduced playfulness or lethargy, fever and active cough is recommended; this is feasible in a contacttracing scenario. 20, 37, 38 Symptom screening and a chest X-ray (CXR) are strongly recommended before commencing TPT. Physical examination should also be conducted to ensure that there are no palpable lymphadenopathy suggestive of TB lymphadenitis or other signs of extrapulmonary TB disease. An evidence-based algorithm to exclude TB disease is shown in Figure 1 . We acknowledge that CXR and the expertise to interpret the CXR may not be readily available, especially in resource-limited settings. In such scenarios, the lack of CXR should not be a barrier to TPT, and symptom screening should be prioritised. 20 Individuals with symptoms suggestive of TB disease should be investigated according to national guidelines, including PLHA with normal CXR, as it is well-recognised that TB disease may still be present. 39 Constitutional symptoms may overlap with other diseases such as malignancies, which may also co-exist with TB disease; further investigations are therefore needed when TB investigations are negative. 40 Those in whom TB disease and other differential diagnoses are excluded should be assessed for eligibility for TPT. The investigations that are used to exclude TB disease are shown in Table 4 . Both CXR and chest computed tomography (CT) scans are well-established clinical tools to investigate TB disease. Computer-assisted diagnostic software such as the computer-aided detection of TBrelated abnormalities on CXR (CAD) combines digital CXR with an algorithmic interpretation to provide a TB risk score; in some cases, this may be complemented by remote expertise in order to diagnose pulmonary TB promptly and select patients who should undergo further TB disease investigations. CAD has now been implemented in resourcelimited settings, where automated interpretation and remote radiology may be particularly helpful. 41 However, this technology is not validated for use in children nor for other pulmonary diseases that mimic TB. Figure 1 Algorithm to exclude TB disease before initiating TPT. *For adults and adolescents, including PLHA, a four-symptom screening of cough, fever, weight loss or night sweats is recommended. For infants and children living with HIV/AIDS and/or in contact with a person with infectious TB disease, screening for poor weight gain/loss of weight, fever, cough, decreased playfulness, symptoms of extrapulmonary TB (e.g., mass in neck, lethargy/sleepiness, vomiting) is recommended. \u2020 CXR should be performed but lack of CXR should not be a barrier to initiating TPT in resource-limited settings. \u2021 TST or IGRA if available is ideal to identify PLHA who might benefit most from TPT. \u00a7 Patients should also be investigated for other diseases such as malignancies which have similar constitutional symptoms with TB disease. If clinical suspicion for TB disease is high but investigations are negative, a specialist may be consulted to determine if the patient should be empirically started on anti-TB treatment. In the event that TB disease is excluded, PLHA and household contacts 5 years old should be considered for TST/IGRA screening and TPT.

Regimens should be chosen considering the individual's characteristics such as age, risk of toxicity or drug-drug interaction, comorbidities, drug susceptibility of the likely source strain, drug availability and availability of appropriate formulations (i.e., fixed-dose combination [FDC] pills). The choice is also determined by programmatic factors such as the choice to use or not to use rifamycin-containing regimens for prevention. The WHO recommends that national TB programmes should progressively transition to shorter rifamycinbased regimens given the better safety profile and better prospects of TPT completion. 20 3HR is a convenient and safe regimen with a FDC pill(s) and higher rate of completion compared to 6H. 4R is likely to be better tolerated and safer than 3HR or 6H. However, there is concern regarding the use of RIF as a single drug in high-prevalence, low-resource countries, where exclusion of TB disease may be problematic, or in settings where RIF is readily available as an over-the-counter drug without the need for prescriptions from a medical practitioner. In such settings, there may be an increase in RIFresistant TB. The 6H (or 9H) regimen has long been the only available regimen, and is therefore well studied. The reasons to choose this regimen presently are mainly due to fewer drug-drug interactions than rifamycin regimens (especially in PLHA on protease inhibitor-based regimen, nevirapine, or integrase inhibitors due to potential drug-drug interactions), scarcity of alternative regimens, mainly in lowresource countries. The WHO had noted that all regimens can be self-administered, and that directlyobserved-therapy (DOT) would pose a significant barrier to implementation. 20 Individuals should be supported through education and counselling as described in Standard 2.",

Risks of drug-related toxicity should therefore be minimised by informing individuals receiving TPT to avoid alcohol and other drugs that interact with TPT. Individuals on TPT should ideally be monitored clinically at regular monthly intervals, either by phone or text messaging or other modalities according to feasibility. For individuals with abnormal baseline test results, sound clinical judgement is required to ensure that the benefit of TPT outweighs the risks, and they should be tested routinely. Access to informed healthcare providers and appropriate laboratory testing should also be performed for patients who become symptomatic while on treatment (e.g., liver function tests for those with symptoms of hepatotoxicity such as nausea, vomiting and jaundice/teacoloured urine). Adverse effects should be closely followed. For example, it is recommended to stop a rifamycin and/or INH-containing regimen when there is an increase in transaminases to 5 times the upper limit of normal or to 3 times with symptoms of hepatotoxicity.",

There is no data on how to handle interruptions to TPT, i.e., how many missed doses can be replaced by prolonging treatment without compromising efficacy. 20 The WHO provides guidance on the management of treatment interruptions and defines treatment completion as 80% of recommended doses in a maximum number of days, which can be used as a guide. 20 Data for management of nonadherence to the shorter 1HP or 3HP regimes are also needed. Given the absence of a reliable test that can ascertain infection clearance, maximising adherence is especially important. Interventions to enhance adherence and completion of treatment should be tailored to the specific needs of risk groups, including migrants, be culturally appropriate and in the language of the individual. A systematic review conducted for the WHO 2015 TBI guidelines provided heterogeneous results for interventions to improve treatment adherence and completion, and the evidence was considered inconclusive. 52 Although evidence is inconclusive, it is recommended to prepare an adherence plan with the individual and discuss this at each healthcare encounter (ideally at monthly follow-ups), especially for children on TPT. The WHO guidelines for the treatment of drugsusceptible TB disease should be taken as a model, using interventions to support adherence, including mobile phone-based support systems and personalised approaches, because they could also be applied to TPT.",

An electronic application for mobile phones has been created by the WHO to guide national programmes on critical data to collect along the TBI care pathway as an accessory to monitoring and evaluation. 53 The feasibility of measuring efficacy of preventive therapy should be assessed. This would require the collection of information about the occurrence of TB disease in people who have received TPT. Measurement of efficacy also requires patients registered for TB treatment to be asked about their history of starting or completing TPT, and updating TBI registers with pre-existing data or the crosslinking of registers (e.g., TBI registers compared with TB treatment or mortality registers). For people who develop TB disease after, or well into a TPT course, drug susceptibility testing is critically important.
