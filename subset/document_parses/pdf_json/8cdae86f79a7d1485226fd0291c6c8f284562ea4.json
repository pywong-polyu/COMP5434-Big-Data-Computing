            "text": "Background When the COVID-19 pandemic restricted visitation between intensive care unit patients and their families, the virtual intensive care unit (vICU) in our large tertiary hospital was adapted to facilitate virtual family visitation. The objective of this paper is to document findings from interviews conducted with family members on three categories: (1) feelings experienced during the visit, (2) barriers, challenges or concerns faced using this service, and (3) opportunities for improvements. Methods Family members were interviewed postvisit via phone. For category 1 (feelings), automated analysis in Python using the Valence Aware Dictionary for sentiment Reasoner package produced weighted valence (extent of positive, negative or neutral emotive connotations) of the interviewees' word choices. Outputs were compared with a manual coder's valence ratings to assess reliability. Two raters conducted inductive thematic analysis on the notes from these interviews to analyse categories 2 (barriers) and 3 (opportunities). Results Valence-based and manual sentiment analysis of 230 comments received on feelings showed over 86% positive sentiments (88.2% and 86.8%, respectively) with some neutral (7.3% and 6.8%) and negative (4.5% and 6.4%) sentiments. The qualitative analysis of data from 57 participants who commented on barriers showed four primary concerns: inability to communicate due to patient status (44% of respondents); technical difficulties (35%); lack of touch and physical presence (11%); and frequency and clarity of communications with the care team (11%). Suggested improvements from 59 participants included: on demand access (51%); improved communication with the care team (17%); improved scheduling processes (10%); and improved system feedback and technical capabilities (17%). Conclusions Use of vICU for remote family visitations evoked happiness, joy, gratitude and relief and a sense of closure for those who lost loved ones. Identified areas for concern and improvement should be addressed in future implementations of telecritical care for this purpose.",

Recent updates on telehealth billing include more than 80 new US Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services codes and relaxed requirements for software compliance with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act in the USA, as well as waiving of origination site restrictions, 1 collectively contributing to widespread adoption of telehealth technologies. In addition to its utility for screening and non-emergency care, many healthcare organisations have adopted telehealth systems for inpatient settings such as intensive care units (ICUs). Virtual ICUs (vICUs), also known as electronic ICUs and telecritical care, have gained popularity among health systems in the last decade to address a significant shortage of intensivists. These systems have expanded the boundaries of a traditional ICU while delivering tangible benefits such as decreased mortality, reduced length of stay, reduced cost and improved quality of care. 2 3 While the telepresence functionality represents its chief utility, vICU's other latent functions have been recognised by many. For example, ICU patients and their loved ones were deeply affected when, for safety reasons, our hospital restricted visitation to the ICU to prevent infection risk; vICU technology could function to allow for remote visitation.",

Previous studies also show that separating families from the patients can adversely impact the patient's feelings of security and ultimate Original research outcome. 5 In addition, patients with COVID-19 in the ICU face additional risk of acquiring ICU-related physical, cognitive and mental health impairments, or post-ICU syndrome, which may manifest as delirium, depression or post-traumatic stress disorder and can persist beyond the acute hospitalisation. ICU Liberation Collaborative studies have shown that families play a very important role in the recovery of patients and their quality of post-ICU life. 6 During the COVID-19 pandemic, almost all hospitals in the USA disallowed visitors for all adult inpatients including all COVID-19 and non-COVID ICU patients. Although commonly available for everyday use, video chat technologies such as FaceTime, Zoom and Skype have limited value in an ICU setting with a highly infectious critically ill patient population. Generally sedated and intubated, these patients cannot independently access these social media oriented technologies and require the medical staff to bring in and position mobile equipment (smartphone or tablet), subjecting the staff to unnecessary risk of infection while drawing down the limited supply of personal protective equipment (PPE). In contrast, the vICU infrastructure provides a much safer and more accessible alternative, reducing in particular the need for staff to go in and out of the protective area.",

In this paper, we document this improvised utilisation of vICU technology in our health system to allow family members to visit an ICU patient during the COVID-19 pandemic virtually and present the findings from postvisit interviews with family members to understand barriers, challenges, concerns, feelings and opportunities to improve this functionality.

The virtual ICU at Houston Methodist has three main components: the operations centre (OC), the bedside team and the audio-visual (A/V) communication infrastructure that links the two (figure 1). 7 The OC provides a central command centre where the vMDs and virtual RNs (vRNs) sit and connect with the bedside clinicians while monitoring the patient. Our OC uses an FDA-cleared software-based monitoring and analytics platform called Sickbay. The physiological data from several bedside monitors and devices including ventilators, haemodynamic monitors and the static data from the electronic medical records interface with this platform. Novel algorithms transform these big data into actionable information in the form of risk scores, which feed into clinical decision support systems. The OC is also where virtual A/V connections are established with the patients' rooms. The camera in the patients' room has a 360\u00b0 pan, tilt and zoom capability so that the vMDs and vRNs can examine the patient and closely observe the intravenous fluids, the drip rates, the monitors and the ventilator settings and, of course, communicate with the patients and the bedside providers.",

The two vRNs in the OC then collaborated with the bedside staff to determine the communication technology capabilities and preferences of the patients' families, as well as to ensure the patient is camera ready for the family visit. One of the vRNs would then send a text or email link to the family members' internet-connected devices (eg, smartphones, tablets and computers). Clicking that link instantly connected the patient's family with the ICU room in which their loved one was present, using the cameras and monitors already installed in the ICU rooms. The bedside nurse usually stayed on to facilitate communication with the family, especially if the patient was intubated. Restrictions on visitors also applied to non-COVID patients, and hence the Consultant Bridge was used for all types of virtual ICU patients. Using Consultant Bridge, we averaged about 35 calls per day in 3 weeks (from 6 to 27 April 2020). The virtual visits lasted around 30 min on average.",

A sentiment score varying between \u22121 and 1 is then calculated based on the type and intensity of the sentiment. For this analysis, VADER was applied to the total text of notes per respondent.

Ideally, the call scheduling feature should be integrated with the medical records and procedure scheduling to avoid any overlap.

First, in this study, we did not take into account the demographics of families who opted in or out of the virtual visitation programme. We realise that these enabling technologies have the potential to exacerbate racial, income, technological and educational level disparities. Future studies would benefit from incorporating family demographic data to assess the impact of such disparities and encourage equitable access to these technologies. Second, while the feedback received in this study was overwhelmingly positive, such feedback might have been biased by the fact that this was the only available option to visit patients especially after a long wait in some cases. More work is needed to investigate the visitor experiences at various points in time, with larger and more diverse samples, using validated instruments such as Family Satisfaction in the ICU 14 to evaluate the sustainability of such initiatives and understand challenges and barriers in more detail. Third, a major limitation of this study is lack of a comparison group. While this was not possible during the COVID-19 pandemic, future studies may consider comparing the findings from the vICU visitation with other modes of family-patient communication such as mobile devices. Finally, the interviewers did not have experience in qualitative research; the interviews were short, which did not allow for elaborations and follow-up questions; the interviews were conducted immediately after the visit when family members might have been emotional; and conversations were not recorded, which might have affected the depth and quality of this inquiry. In-depth interviews using experienced interviewers, and scheduled at a later time, are necessary to investigate issues related to virtual family visitation further.",
