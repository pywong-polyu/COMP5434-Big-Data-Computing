Immunization will not provide complete protection and primary preventive measures to reduce person to person transmission will be the most critical tool to bring the pandemic under control. The current FDA approved vaccines are given in two doses and are mRNA vaccines that code for spike protein found on the surface of SARS-CoV-2. Both vaccines have been shown to be 95% effective in their phase II/III trials in individuals older than 16 years of age and have been reported to lower further risk of severe illness from COVID-19 by more than 90%. However, these trials excluded the immunocompromised patients such as patients with autoimmune disorders on immunosuppressants [7, 8] .",
