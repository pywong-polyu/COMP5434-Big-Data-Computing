Additionally, coproduction of arts-in-health activities is widely appreciated as central to the successful development and adaptation of interventions. 17 Furthermore, a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of critical factors required for successful implementation of lung health interventions in low-income and middle-income countries emphasised the importance of ensuring compatibility with the local context and understanding the needs of local users. 18 Through the engagement of key stakeholders, including staff, patients and family members, such activities have the potential to use pre-existing sociocultural resources and minimise dependence on additional external funding or resources.",

KEJP, LC and DW conducted a thematic analysis based on that described by Clarke et al. 24 and Terry et al. 25 During phase 1, transcripts were read and reread, with further listening and familiarising with interview recordings, interviewer reflections and structured observations. Importantly, notes from discussions between GN, IK, KEJP, LLC, RJ, BK and WK made during data collection were used to facilitate understanding. Phase 2 included open free-coding, discussion, double-coding, cross-case analysis and development of coding structure. As such the analysis was predominantly inductive in nature, although deductive elements were contributed by the semistructured nature of using a topic guide. The coding structure was then refined into preliminary themes (phase 3), which were further discussed, refined, named and agreed on (phases 4 and 5). Participant validation was performed with staff members at the MLI. Given current COVID-19 restrictions, further patient participant validation was not performed; however, clarity and interparticipant consistency of identified themes suggest that further participant validation would have been unlikely to dramatically alter findings. Theme saturation was achieved during the analysis; however, given the exploratory nature of the study, all data were analysed. Coding and theme development used Microsoft Excel. Demographic and disease-specific information was sought from patient participants. Breathlessness scores were completed as an indication of disease-related functional impairment. This was selected given the heterogeneity of lung conditions represented; hence, a generic rather than disease-specific assessment was appropriate. Additionally, breathlessness is a key assessment criterion for PR and hence relevant for the application of this study's findings.",

These factors were important for two reasons: first to ensure that no member of the group felt uncomfortable or excluded; and second, responsive contextualisation was seen as a tool to optimise engagement and enjoyment-by selecting songs, music or dances that had cultural or historical significance to the group, a sense of collective identity could be established.

First, being a single-site study, with a sample of 19 participants, the transferability of findings cannot be ascertained, particularly regarding areas of Uganda outside of Kampala, where social and cultural groups and norms are likely to differ. However, Kampala is a district that has a mixture of all tribes in Uganda, and the MLI is a specialist centre receiving referrals from all over the country. Second, COVID-19 pandemic restrictions relating to certain group activities, including singing and exercise, 27 are currently in place, and these data were collected prior to the pandemic; hence, COVID-19-related concerns may change the experience of group activities such as music and dance when they are considered safe to recommence. Additionally, here we report participants' perceptions regarding potential health benefits, and although in general beneficial effects of similar interventions have been demonstrated, formal research and evaluation of this specific intervention are still required.",

Research on Singing for Lung Health in the UK suggests participants perceive a range of physical, psychological and social benefits in keeping with our findings. 11 14 19 21 28 29 Similarly, studies regarding the perceived impact of dance for people with long-term respiratory conditions in the UK and Canada identify a range of biopsychosocial benefits. 10 12 30 Additionally, an evaluation of SFB Uganda, a singing project for people with CRD in Uganda, provided anecdotal reports that participation was enjoyed, 22 and our findings are broadly in keeping with the evaluation of SFB. Similarly, anecdotal experience of related singing and dance projects for people with long-term respiratory conditions in other lowresource settings showed participants enjoyed the experience and reported a range of biopsychosocial benefits. 31 A study of culturally adapted PR at the MLI also showed high levels of acceptability. 8 Importantly, in each situation described, contextual adaptation and codevelopment of activities appear crucial to success. Interestingly, there was close alignment regarding responses from patients and healthcare professionals. This may be expected with regard to the general role of music and dance in Uganda, but was also the case in relation to potential therapeutic interventions. The main differences between the groups were healthcare professionals discussing potential therapeutic mechanisms in more depth and emphasising the requirement for an evidence base to increase acceptance. Future research should include assessing the impact of participation on relevant health outcomes and physiological parameters, building on related physiological research already completed. 13 The current COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated certain restrictions on group activities such as singing 27 and dancing, which are likely to impact the potential application of these findings in the short term. However, developments including widespread immunisations, infection control measures and remotely delivered singing and dance interventions 11 32 33 may help reduce risk. Additionally, although the majority of participants were highly positive about participation, there were exceptions. As such, music and dance could be used as optional adjuncts to optimise uptake and completion of established, evidence-based respiratory management approaches such as PR.",
