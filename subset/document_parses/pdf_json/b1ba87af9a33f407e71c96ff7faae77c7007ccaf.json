The epoxidation kinetics of the heterogeneous system formed by aluminium oxide catalyst, hydrogen peroxide and methyl oleate as a model compound was studied with semibatch experiments in laboratory scale. It was found that semibatch operation improved the performance significantly compared to classical batch operation, a low and constant volumetric flowrate of hydrogen peroxide increased the final oxirane yield considerably. A semibatch reactor model and a kinetic model were developed, featuring the reaction temperature, the reactant molar ratio, the catalyst loading and the mass flow rate as the most significant experimental parameters. The mathematical model was able to well describe the experimental data. The approach can be applied to other liquid-solid catalyst systems in future in order to optimize the semibatch operation policy for complex reaction systems.",

The main motivation is an eventual depletion of oil resources and the need to diminish the pollution associated to their utilization. Therefore, the research is nowadays keenly looking for alternative sources of raw materials with a more environmentally friendly approach. Biomass valorization is one of the most promising fields of investigation in this matter. An important amount of methods and procedures for the application of biomass as an ecofriendly source of chemicals and fuels have been developed (Sheldon, 2014; Mohanty et al., 2002) . Among the valuable components of biomass, vegetable oils represent very advantageous feedstock.",

One of the most promising routes of valorization is the transformation of the double bonds in vegetable oils to epoxides (Freites Danov et al., 2017) . The main method for the production of epoxidized vegetable oils is the Prileschajew epoxidation (current industrial process) (Freites Aguilera et al., 2019) , which consists of a biphasic system with an oxidant agent (mainly hydrogen peroxide), an oxygen carrier (percarboxylic acid) and the unsaturated vegetable oil.",

            "text": "Homogenous and heterogeneous catalysts (mainly mineral acids and solid resin catalysts with sulphonic acid groups) have been applied to enhance the formation of percarboxylic acid (Vianello et al., 2018; Zheng et al., 2015) . The percarboxylic acid is produced in situ through perhydrolysis of a carboxylic acid with hydrogen peroxide. The percarboxylic acid then diffuses to the organic phase to react with the double bonds and form an epoxide. At an industrial scale some key market players using Prileschajew system for production of epoxidized vegetable oils are Arkema SA (France), CHS INC (U.S.), Ferro corporation (U.S.), Hairma chemicals (GZ) Ltd (China) (ESBO, 2020) . Epoxidized vegetable oils find applications as additives or plasticizers in paint, coating or PVC (Horvath and Malacria, 2020) . Some other methods for the production of epoxides have also been reported in the literature (Santacesaria et al., 2011; Mandelli, 2001; Scotti et al., 2015; Sepulveda et al., 2007; Gunam Resul et al., 2018; Li et al., 2006; Phimsen et al., 2017; Parada Hernandez et al., 2017; Turco et al., 2017; Nur et al., 2001; Campanella et al., 2004; Goud et al., 2007) , such is the case of the direct epoxidation with an oxidant agent (i.e. hydrogen peroxide, TBHP, O 2 ) in the presence of a heterogeneous catalyst. These heterogeneous methods present a greener approach. By avoiding the use of carboxylic acid, no perhydrolysis takes place in the system, which contributes to high exothermicity, waste and troublesome separation of the final products. In addition, the impact of undesired reactions, such as ring opening is diminished by applying direct epoxidation with an oxidant agent like hydrogen peroxide as only reagent. Recently, a thermal risk assessment has been carried out by our group (P\u00e9rez-Sena et al., 2020) , in which the classical Prileschajew method was compared to the alumina catalyzed epoxidation, and the latter one was found to present less risk with a lower probability of thermal runaway.",

Therefore, it is possible to summarize the influences of some operational parameters such as optimal catalyst loading, reaction temperature and reactant molar ratio on the epoxidation rate. These effects have already been studied by various groups of researchers (Mandelli, 2001; Sepulveda et al., 2007; Parada Hernandez et al., 2017; Turco et al., 2016; Miao and Liu, 2014. It was re-confirmed that an increase of the catalyst loading increases the yield of oxirane proportionally (Fig S1 in Supplementary material), but, an increase exceeding 10 wt% does not seem to improve significantly the final yield of the product. As the catalyst amount exceeded 10 wt%, the proportionality between the reaction rate and the active element concentration was not maintained, which could be due to rapid side catalytic hydrogen peroxide decomposition when high amount of catalyst are loaded. The influence of temperature was also investigated ( Fig S2) and as expected, the epoxidation kinetics was enhanced with an increasing temperature resulting in a higher reactant conversion and product yield. However, the maximum operating temperature that can be reached in the system is limited by the boiling point of the solvent, in this case ethyl acetate (77\u00b0C under atmospheric pressure). From Fig S3 the optimal double bond-to-hydrogen peroxide molar ratio was confirmed to be at around 1:6 as corroborated by Sepulveda et al. (Sepulveda et al., 2007) in their research. A further increase of this ratio did not result in any significant improvement of the final yield and conversion. The highest double bond conversion and epoxy yield observed were 90% and 82% respectively when maximum temperature, lowest hydrogen peroxide mass flow, 1:6 reactant molar ratio and 10 wt% catalyst were applied.",

This semibatch operation mode is currently used in industrial scale in the Prileschajew epoxidation. By dosing one or more of the reactants to the reaction system, the heat evolution of this very exothermic reaction is kept controlled. Hence, secondary reactions such as the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide percarboxylic acids are diminished and a good yield of the final product is obtained.",

            "text": "In principle in a semibatch setup where hydrogen peroxide is continuously added over a period, its consumption depends on the dosing rate. The lower the feed rate of the reactant, the less accumulation, therefore in theory one could be even able to adjust the dosing rate to the reaction rate of hydrogen peroxide and virtually no accumulation would take place. Fig. 2 demonstrates clearly that operation under semibatch conditions significantly improves the reactant conversion and the product yield in the epoxidation reaction: an improvement of more than 30% was observed when low-flow semibatch conditions were applied compared to batch operation under identical conditions. It has been proposed by some researchers (Mandelli, 2001; Parada Hernandez et al., 2017; P\u00e9rez-Sena et al., 2020; Turco et al., 2016; Salem et al., 1993) that the peroxide sites formed on the catalyst surface due to the adsorption of hydrogen peroxide are either utilized to epoxidize the double bond or released in the form of molecular oxygen, i.e., catalyzed hydrogen peroxide decomposition. It is assumed that the overall hydrogen peroxide decomposition (non-catalyzed and catalyzed) taking place in parallel with the epoxidation of the double bond (Fig. 3 ) has a more rapid rate than the epoxidation process. Hence, in a batch reactor setup where a high concentration of hydrogen peroxide is present at the beginning, the decomposition rates can quickly reduce the available hydrogen peroxide, which forms active surface sites that later react with the double bond of the vegetable oil. On the other hand, when the same amount of hydrogen peroxide is loaded into the reactor gradually over an extended period, favorable conditions for the epoxidation reaction are maintained. Fig. 4 displays the hydrogen peroxide concentration evolution in both operation modes. In the batch experiment, a rapid consumption of hydrogen peroxide is evidenced: after four hours of reaction, around 50% of the total hydrogen peroxide have been consumed. This decrease of the concentration affects negatively the overall kinetics because all the reactions in the system are strongly dependent on this reagent. However, in the case of semibatch experiments, the addition of concentrated hydrogen peroxide at a constant dosing rate helped to keep an increasing concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the reactor until the addition was stopped. Thereafter, the concentration started to decrease at the same rate as in the batch experiment. From Fig. 4 , it can be concluded that lower dosing rates provide a good reaction environment. By extending the total addition time and letting a fresh hydrogen peroxide solution enter the system, epoxidation kinetics is favored. Besides that, It can also be speculated that the water always being present in the hydrogen peroxide solution is strongly adsorbed on the catalyst surface, as indicated by some studies (Mandelli, 2001; Turco et al., 2016; Lef\u00e8vre et al., 2002; Osman et al., 2017) . A considerable amount of water is formed during the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, which is highly promoted in a batch mode of operation. Water adsorption could in theory reduce the catalytic capabilities of c-alumina by blocking the pores for the hydrogen peroxide to react and making difficult the diffusion of the olefin to the active sites (Rinaldi and Schuchardt, 2004) . In this sense, the use of a more concentrated hydrogen peroxide solution (i.e. 50/70 wt%) or the use of an anhydrous hydrogen peroxide solution could probably improve the reaction outcome because of fewer water in the system as demonstrated by some researcher (Mandelli, 2001; Sepulveda et al., 2007) .",

From the viewpoint of fundamental chemical thinking, the rival mechanisms are quite different, but they have a common feature: the formation of a hydroperoxyl adduct on the alumina surface. Thus, a common step for the reaction sequence is presumed to be the activation of OH ligands on the alumina surface through reaction with hydrogen peroxide (Rinaldi and Schuchardt, 2004) , leading to the formation of a hydroperoxyl group and release of water from the catalyst surface. The hydroperoxyl group is then able to further react with unsaturated fatty acid ester. After several intermediate steps, the epoxide group is finally formed, and the epoxidized product is desorbed from the catalyst surface. Considerable amounts of water remain on the surface. In this sense, the Sharpless route (Fig. 7) and the stepwise mechanism proposed in the literature are similar (Suarez et al., 2009) . It is assumed that formed hydroperoxyl adduct (OOH*) releases oxygen into the liquid bulk phase, whereas adsorbed water (W*) remains on the catalyst surface until it is released from the surface via desorption or converted to OH. The decomposition mechanism of hydrogen peroxide can be written as H 2 O 2 + OH* !OOH* + H 2 O OOH* !1/2O 2 + OH* It should be noticed that the above equations are a simplification of the real surface reaction mechanism, probably proceeding stepwise, e.g. The first step is presumed to be reversible, whereas the other steps are taken as irreversible. The rate equations of the elementary steps are formulated in a standard manner,",

Complete backmixing was assured for the reactor content because vigorous stirring (800 rpm) was applied, and the reactor was equipped with baffles; the external mass transfer resistance at the outer surface of the catalyst could thus be regarded negligible as discussed previously.

Therefore, the impact of these reactions was neglected and excluded from the catalytic model. Also, the merged parameters b and c were noticed to be of very low values compared to the rest of adsorption parameters. Thus, simplified versions of the rate expressions, Eqs. (21) and (22) were used, only taking into account k I , k II , x and the a parameter (k I /k II ), which were of importance in practice.

Dosing the hydrogen peroxide over an extended period of time enabled to maintain a good availability of this reactant in the system. Because the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide takes place rather rapidly, therefore, controlling this process was very essential for a more efficient epoxidation. During the experiments, it was observed that the concentration of hydrogen peroxide in the reactor was always higher in the semibatch operation mode when compared to the batch operation mode. Low flow rates of hydrogen peroxide improved the oxirane yield in more than a 30%.",

The number of adjustable kinetic parameters to be estimated by regression analysis were reduced by studying independently the non-catalytic reactions in the system. The obtained model of the non-catalytic kinetics was integrated to the catalytic epoxidation kinetics. A good fit of the mathematical model was achieved by applying this strategy. The proposed kinetic model described very well the behavior of the system, and it can serve for further evaluations of similar heterogeneous system for the epoxidation of vegetable oils. With the modelling approach presented in this work, the optimal dosing policy and temperate for semibatch operation can be found. ",
