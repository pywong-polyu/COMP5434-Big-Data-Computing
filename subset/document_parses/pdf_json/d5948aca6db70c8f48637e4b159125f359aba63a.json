            "text": "Purpose This study aimed to develop and evaluate the feasibility and preliminary efficiency of a methodology to measure the mindfulness state using a wearable device (\"Cap\") capable of monitoring students' levels of full attention by means of real-time measured heart rate variability (HRV). Methods The device was developed to export the data to the user's smartphone via Bluetooth, which in turn stores the securely accessible data in the cloud. The autonomous wearable device consists of electronic boards of the Arduino platform that detect the period in milliseconds between two subsequent referential R peaks of the QRS complex wave through infrared oxygenation sensor. Results In a population of 13 subjects (8 female, 5 male, age 16.1 years \u00b10.58 ), the Z-test ( p < 0.05 ) using rMSSD (root mean squared successive differences) and the Toronto Mindfulness (Curiosity) Scale within two 50 min windows, shows that increased HRV values converge to high values for the mindfulness state when the time difference between R n and R n+1 samples is greater than 88 ms. Conclusion The device proved to be viable and potentially effective for measuring the state of mindfulness. Thus, further studies should be conducted to test it on a large scale as well as in real classroom situations.",

Other studies have shown the feasibility and accuracy of remotely monitoring vital signs [49] [50] [51] . With the versatility of the IoTs, a Cap-shaped prototype was designed, with circuits fixed (sewn) on its external side. Figure 1 shows the Cap model, the environment test and the circuit. The main board comes from a worldwide open platform [52, 53] , model Arduino Nano ATmega328 V3, 16 MHz clock, 31 KB flash and 1 KB EEPROM (no storage memory), powered by a 9 V rechargeable battery through the Vin pin (which in turn has an input voltage regulator that supports 7 to 20 V and provides 5 and 3.3). From the main board, the power supply is derived for the other peripheral boards, such as the sensors and the Bluetooth communication board and a EEPROM CJMCU-2516/16 MB Arduino memory module, with I2C interface.",
