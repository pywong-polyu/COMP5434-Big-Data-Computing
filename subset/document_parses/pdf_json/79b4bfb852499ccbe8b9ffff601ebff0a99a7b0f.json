            "text": "On March 11, 2020 , the World Health Organization officially announced the COVID-19, the contagious disease caused by the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2, as a pandemic. In the United Kingdom, for example, there were over 4.3 million confirmed COVID-19 cases and more than 120,000 associated deaths reported up to the March of 2021 ever since the first case was confirmed in York in England on January 22, 2020 1 . The COVID-19 pandemic is widely disruptive to the whole society, especially the economy 2 . For example, United Kingdom has gone through three lockdowns, and many businesses have been temporarily or permanently shut down. Even worse, both the pandemic itself and the economic disruption had a serious impact on people's mental health. It was estimated in 2014 that one in six adults in England had a common mental disorder, and mental disorders were more common in people living alone 3 . Due to the factors like isolations and restrictions, economic recession, or even the neurological and psychiatric sequelae of COVID- 19 4 , mental health in the United Kingdom had significantly deteriorated during the early stage of the pandemic compared to the pre-COVID-19 era 5 . While recent studies showed that the evolving COVID-19 pandemic leads to mental health globally with increasing cases of depression, selfharm, suicide, etc. 6 7 , it is crucial to identify the individuals at risk of mental health issues as early as possible so that substantial resources could be better allocated.",
