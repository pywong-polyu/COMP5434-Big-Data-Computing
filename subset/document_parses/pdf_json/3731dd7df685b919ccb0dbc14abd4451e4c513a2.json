It is well known that SARS-CoV-2 spreads through the respiratory mucosa and invades other cells, induces a series of immune responses, and causes changes in peripheral white blood cells, including lymphocytes [19] .

This study also found that lymphocyte counts were significantly lower in elderly than in adult and child patients. In a retrospective study compared the clinical features of COVID-19 in elderly patients with young and middle-aged patients, Liu et al. found that the proportion of lymphocytes in the elderly group was significantly lower than that in the young and middle-aged group (p < 0.001) [13] .

We found that diabetes mellitus, renal failure and hypertension were present in 27.0%, 13.9% and 10% of the cases, respectively. This is in agreement with a previous report, in which COVID-19 patients were reported to have comorbid conditions [4, 19] . In addition, research data show that patients \u2265 60 years old are at higher risk than children, who are less likely to have an infection, or who show mild to asymptomatic infection [28] . The increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 complications in older people with comorbid conditions have been well documented in the literature [19] . [4] . Chen et al. [19] suggested that 2019-nCoV is more likely to infect older adult men with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune functions of these patients [19] . A study indicated that COVID-19 infection progresses rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome, septic shock, metabolic acidosis, coagulation dysfunction, and leads to death in older patients and those with comorbid conditions [25] . Therefore, identifying host risk factors associated with severe COVID-19 infections may help in designing specific strategies to prevent and treat the disease [4] .",
