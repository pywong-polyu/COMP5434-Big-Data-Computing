However, these models do not deal with the dependent stream of data. LSTM based model is an alternative popular method [4] used for modeling dependent data. LSTM and its variations are useful in areas such as Natural Language Processing [ [19] , [18] ], Financial Time series, or some application of speech processing. Many researchers ( [6] , [1] , [5] ) used an LSTM model to predict the stock price. None of the literature contains any methodology/convenient way to construct an appropriate confidence band in this setup. Also, there is no appropriate notion available to find the best confidence interval of the forecast signals in an LSTM type of model set up.",

The feature scaling is a crucial part of training LSTM models in this context. It normalizes the entire data, feature-wise, to convert it to values between 0 and 1 using min-max scaling. Different types of normalization are available in the literature. However in this paper we use the following relation for normalization : x norm = x\u2212x min x max \u2212x min . Since we deal with a constant time step (lookback) while training LSTM, it makes sense to normalize the data in each lookback-length window. However, the prediction from the model is later de-normalized. We use the Adam optimization algorithm to train the LSTM model. The choice of optimal lookback and batch size are made by trial and error method so that the optimal number minimize RMSE of the test set. Details of choice for the parameter tuning are available in Section 5.",

[3] established that the best block size depends on three factors: the autocorrelation structure, the series length, and the reason for bootstrapping. Most of the papers discussed such choices in the context of estimation or finding sampling distribution of bootstrap mean or variances for dependent set up [ [11] , [13] , [9] ]. The purpose of any bootstrap is to regenerate the sample, which behaves like the original sample. Therefore it is expected that a regenerated sample should be the best representation of the original sample. Thus the best bootstrapping algorithm mimics the data in the best possible way. Statistically, this is possible when the variance of the generated curve shows a minimal variation for the original curve. However, quantifying this variance is not unique, and thus many algorithms are available. Finding the mean series from the blocks of the original and bootstrapped sample and creating a distance function for the same could be a way to quantify this variation. Demirel and Willemain ( [2] ) uses a similar concept in their paper to find the best bootstrap length. His approach uses Higher-order crossings (HOC) to form the benchmark to find out the bootstrap length. This approach does not have a proper theoretical basis for non-stationary data and has many shortcomings.",

However, from our experimental analysis and empirical evidence, we observe it is reasonable to take its value as 2.

We introduce kernel regularizer, which is essentially regularization on the weights of neurons. The optimal choice of block length depends on the dataset we use for empirical analysis. For S&P 500 data, we get block length as 3 for LBB and 4 for NBB and MBB. The optimal block length for Google stock price data is 6 for all bootstrap algorithms.

We take a graphical sense of the fact by plotting original data and bootstrap resampled data obtained through different procedures. Fig.3, Fig.4, Fig.5 show that local block bootstrap best captures the patterns of the original data. Fig.6, Fig.7, Fig.8 provide the picture of the constructed confidence interval of Google stock price on the test set by Local block bootstrap, Non-overlapping block bootstrap, Moving block bootstrap, respectively. For S& P 500, we see the prediction bands in Fig.9, Fig.10, Fig.11 respectively. The Prediction in the case of S& P 500, deals with a lesser number of hidden parameters within LSTM nodes. We observe that the predicted curve better matches with actual observations if we increase the number of hidden nodes in each LSTM cell. As S& P 500 includes some recent stock price data, it reflects the behavior in the presence of the current coronavirus pandemic. The last part of the Figure shows a sharp depletion of the stock price, which is the pandemic effect. We can see how the confidence interval constructed captures original data in the presence of the coronavirus shock wave. We also compute the proposed comparing factor for both the data using the three of these bootstrap procedures. For Google stock price, we obtain the values as 47484.094, 53325.1136, and 53767.2914, respectively, whereas for S& P 500, we get the numbers as 163697.7224, 184850.4583, 189109.1758 respectively. As the minimum comparing factor should provide the best procedure for the setup, Local block bootstrap appears to be the best bootstrap procedure to construct a confidence interval in univariate LSTM set up which comes out as the best in terms of comparing factor in S&P 500 as well as Google stock price data set. It makes sense to get Local block bootstrap as the best procedure in all cases, as we observe from Fig.3 that it mimics the original data the best as compared to other algorithms.",
