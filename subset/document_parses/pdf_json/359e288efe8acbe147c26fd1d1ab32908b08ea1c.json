In addition to expanding the volume of medical knowledge, the characteristics of trainers have changed over the years through the changes in habits and attitudes. According to Prensky's famous article published in 2001, today's medical students, as he designated as \"digital natives,\" do not just have different hobbies or music preferences; they learn differently as well. Consequently, digital natives have obliged digital immigrants to transform their educational methods and materials [6] . Much more educational materials are in progress to meet the requirements of medical education that have been changing under the influence of many factors involving the changes in pedagogical methods, health care environment, roles of the physician, students' profile, and rapidly increasing volume of medical knowledge [3] [4] [5] [6] . In this descriptive technical report, we wanted to describe educational materials developed using immersive technologies to improve ongoing pediatric surgery student training in our faculty [7] [8] [9] . We harvested computer-aided design software (CAD), 3D printers, AR development tools, hydrogel-combined molding techniques, and 360-degree video recording to construct our educational materials. Students and surgeons worked collaboratively on the construction of educational material; consequently, they embedded it into the theoretical and practical curriculum of pediatric surgery clerkship.",

Then, 3D models were exported as stereolithography (STL) files. They were imported into Meshmixer (Autodesk, San Rafael, USA) and repaired using that software to prepare them for printing. (b) 3D Printing: Ultimaker 2 Extended + (Ultimaker B.V., Geldermalsen, The Netherlands) was preferred for printing 3D models. Following the repair process, 3D models were imported into the Ultimaker Cura (Ultimaker B.V., Geldermalsen, The Netherlands), a specific software used to prepare models for printing. The sizes of the models were rearranged according to the characteristics of models to make them more feasible and effective for clinical and educational indications. Then, settings involving printing material (filament type), nozzle speed, and infill/support futures were modified specific to models and saved as Gcode files. Subsequently, models were 3D printed on Ultimaker 2 Extended + ( Figure 2 ).",

The virtual model of a kidney can be produced through different methods involving creating on CAD software and generating on 3D calculation software by using data acquired through digital imaging and communications in medicine (DICOM) from computed tomographic angiography (CTA) images. We received the virtual model of the kidney using these methods and imported it as an STL file into the CAD software (Fusion 360, Autodesk, San Rafael, USA) ( Figure 5 ). The Create Base feature was selected to enter the direct editing mode. In this mode, due to the importing as an STL file into the software, the virtual model of the kidney was in a mesh form. However, the model allows users to create objects in another form named solid body. As a result, it is impossible to use the mesh form of the virtual model as reference geometry for the external mold. The mesh form of the virtual model was converted to the solid body using the Mesh to the B-Rep conversion tool. Then, the sketches, 2D geometries used as a base to construct 3D geometries, were created and used as paths to add three solid pipes (an inlet runner duct and two outlet vents) that facilitate the unidirectional filling of the kidney. A box was created according to the earlier designed parts of the mold to be the target body. The inverse geometry of the kidney and additional technical features were created by combining them with the target body using cut operation. In other words, firstly, the parts that would be hollow in the completed mold were created; then, they were excluded from the box that would be the body of the mold. Then the mold was split into two pieces using a horizontal plate to facilitate the removal of the kidney model. The completed external mold was exported and converted into an STL file ( Figure 6 ). It was then 3D printed on the Ultimaker 2 Extended+ (Figure 7 ).",

We constructed the hybrid pediatric surgery book based on AR to overcome these limitations. AR would be defined as a system that blends real and virtual worlds and enables users to perceive digital virtual visual content through real-life and real-time interaction. Compared to Virtual Reality, AR does not cut the connections of users with reality and surrounds them with a virtual world; instead, AR adds a layer onto real life. Another difference between AR and VR is device requirement. AR can be used with highly accessible devices, even with personal smartphones, whereas, VR requires relatively higher cost special devices, which was why we preferred to use AR to enhance the content of the books. The hybrid pediatric surgery book based on AR enabled students to examine spatial relationships and complicated pathologies and interact with them by walking around, zooming in/out, moving, and turning them. In addition to models, anonymized radiological views were added to the related content, which allowed students to easily access the radiologic views, look at their highlighted or raw versions, and examine them in detail by zooming in (Figure 16 ). More importantly, all content was usable through personal devices such as smartphones or tablets. Students were able to access models and radiological views when they wanted and where they wanted (Video 2). Despite the potential of AR to accompany the course curriculum, according to our knowledge, there are still very few examples in literature [8, [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, we believe that enhancing the curriculum with AR would facilitate the learning of students and would be applicable in different surgical and non-surgical specialties with minor changes. ",

The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated that problem by limiting the number of surgeons in-house, case volumes, and inperson learning opportunities [16] . Mirror World is defined as a constructed copy of the real world in digital form [20] . We embedded 360-degree video recordings in Mirror World Simulation to acquire portals to different surgical settings including an operation room (OR), classroom, and a meeting room (Figure 17,  Video 3) . Using the operation room portal, students could experience the surgical procedure as if they were present in OR and review the surgical procedure from different angles. The classroom portal would increase student engagement in lectures, and the meeting room would help incorporate crowded student groups in meetings. We believe that Mirror World Simulation may be an effective solution for the new normal and may help the trainees on different levels, from undergrads to residents, to experience different surgical settings from various angles without time or place restriction.",
