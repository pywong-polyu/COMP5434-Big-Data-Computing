Although it has re-emerged as an epidemic threat, so far there are neither vaccines nor pharmacotherapy available to prevent or treat an infection. Herein, we describe the synthesis and structure\u2212activity relationship studies of a class of novel small molecule inhibitors against CHIKV and the discovery of a new potent inhibitor (compound 6a). The starting point of the optimization process was N-ethyl-6-methyl-2-(4-(4fluorophenylsulfonyl)piperazine-1-yl)pyrimidine-4-amine (1) with an EC 50 of 8.68 \u03bcM, a CC 50 of 122 \u03bcM, and therefore a resulting selectivity index (SI) of 14.2. The optimized compound 6a, however, displays a much lower micromolar antiviral activity (EC 50 value of 3.95 \u03bcM), considerably better cytotoxic liability (CC 50 value of 260 \u03bcM) and consequently an improved SI of greater than 61. Therefore, we report the identification of a promising novel compound class that has the potential for further development of antiviral drugs against the CHIKV.",

Occasionally, corticosteroids are administered to patients to relieve symptoms like fever and pain. 15\u221217 Up to now, the antiviral activity of small molecules, compounds from natural sources, and immune modulators on the replication of chikungunya virus have been investigated. Several compounds, ranging from antivirals with a broad spectrum like ribavirin to harringtonine (a cephalotaxine alkaloid) and IFN-\u03b1, were found to be active, targeting different stages in the alphavirus life cycle. Despite the demonstrated effectiveness and, in some cases, potent antiviral activity in vitro, none of these drugs passed the clinical trial phase. 18\u221225 Also, the utilization of the already known antimalaria drug chloroquine as possible antiviral treatment is highly discussed regarding the potential risks and benefits for the patients. 26\u221230 Therefore, the development of safe and effective new antivirals against CHIKV is highly desirable. 31 This problem was addressed within the EU FP7 collaborative project SILVER. In this project, the small molecular hit CIM016321 (later referred as 1, Figure 1 ), which was identified previously by high-throughput screening by the Center for Innovation and Stimulation of Drug Discovery (CISTIM) and the University of Leuven (KU Leuven), was further investigated and a hit to lead program was initiated.",

Therefore, replacing fluorine on the benzene ring by another halogen leads to an improvement in antiviral activity (chlorine > iodine > bromine > fluorine). 5b with the chlorine atom as substituent on the para position of the benzene ring showed the best test results; therefore, the fluorine/chlorine replacement should be considered for further optimization.",

All compounds described are easily accessible in a four-step synthesis route: starting from the required substituted pyrimidine reacting with the Bocprotected piperazine or other suitable nitrogen-containing functional groups under microwave irradiation, followed by deprotection and finally reaction with a benzenesulfonyl chloride. Additionally, the structural requirements for a significant anti-CHIKV activity have been determined on all five structural molecular subgroups. During this optimization process, 6a was identified as a potent and selective inhibitor of CHIKV, demonstrating a much better profile than the starting point, hit 1, and a selectivity index greater than 61. Furthermore, the optimized compound showed a widespectrum antiviral activity against all tested strains of CHIKV (data will be published elsewhere). Further structure\u2212activity studies and optimization of the antiviral activity are ongoing and mechanism of action studies are being performed to determine the molecular target of this novel class of anti-CHIKV compounds. These studies point toward the viral capping machinery and more specifically to the viral protein nsP1 as the antiviral target of these compounds. Crossresistance with another class of capping inhibitors, the MADTP series, was confirmed in antiviral assays (data not shown). As other classes of inhibitors that target the viral capping have been reported, the capping machinery of alphaviruses might be a hot spot for antiviral molecules. ",
