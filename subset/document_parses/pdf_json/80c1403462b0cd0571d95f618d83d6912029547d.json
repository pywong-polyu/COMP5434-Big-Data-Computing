Results showed that the tuberous rootstock (corm) of African Potato is used traditionally to treat wasting diseases, testicular tumours, insanity, barrenness, impotency, bad dreams, intestinal parasites, urinary infection, cardiac disease and enhancing immunity. The plant contains hypoxoside, which is converted rapidly to a potent antioxidant, rooperol in the gut. The corm contains sterols, sterol glycosides, stanols, terpenoids, saponins, cardiac glycosides, tannins and reducing sugars. A dose of 15 mg/kg/day of hypoxoside is reportedly therapeutic. Preclinical studies of African Potato have shown immunomodulation, antioxidant, antinociceptive, hypoglycaemic, anti-inflammatory, anticonvulsant, antibacterial, uterolytic, antimotility, spasmolytic and anticholinergic effects. The common side effects of African Potato are nausea and vomiting, which subside over time. In vitro, African Potato demonstrated inhibitory effects on CYP1A2, 2C9, 2D6, 3A4, 3A5, CYP19-metabolism and induction of P-glycoprotein. In vivo, it did not alter the pharmacokinetics of efavirenz or lopinavir/ritonavir.",

There are two glucose units at the ends of two benzene rings on hypoxoside [10] . These units are oxidized by \u03b2-glucosidase to form the aglycone, rooperol. The enzyme \u03b2-glucosidase is found mostly in the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) and is released by rapidly dividing cancer cells.

The anti-inflammatory effects of the mixture relieved rheumatoid arthritis in humans. Another small pilot study reported that the BSS/ BSSG mixture resulted in significant improvement in allergic rhinitis/sinusitis after 12 weeks and this was attributed to immunological changes in the cytokine profiles produced by lymphocytes [40] . In vitro, phytosterols can affect different levels of tumor development and they have immune-modulating properties [41] . Phytosterols initiated programmed cell death (apoptosis) in human colon cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.

            "text": "There is limited knowledge on other secondary metabolites of hypoxis. As of 17 October 2018, a literature search found one study in Zimbabwe that compared the phytochemical profiles and cytotoxicity of four species of hypoxis. These were H. hemerocallidea, H. rigidula, H. galpinii and H. obtuse. Although this study did not quantify the phytochemicals, corm extracts of all four species indicated the presence of terpenoids, saponins, cardiac glycosides, tannins and reducing sugars. All species screened negative for alkaloids, flavonoids, and anthraquinones [1] . In other plant species, these phytochemicals are claimed to have curative activity against several pathogens [47] . The phytochemicals identified in this study can be attributed to the biologic activities of hypoxis. Terpenoids have antimicrobial and antioxidant properties and they are explored as cytotoxic and antineoplastic agents [48] . Saponins from plant sources have various pharmacologic effects like antimicrobial, anticancer, anthelmintic, antioxidant, antidiabetic, anticonvulsant, analgesic, antispasmodic, hypocholesterolemic, antitussive and cytotoxic activities [49] . Cardiac glycosides inhibit the Na + /K + pump thus slow the heart rate and increase the contractility of the heart muscle. Although they improve the cardiac output and heart function, their use is associated with toxicity because of a narrow therapeutic index [50] . Tannins have anti-oxidative activities; due to these properties, they are anti-carcinogenic and anti-mutagenic. In addition, tannins have antimicrobial properties, accelerate blood clotting, reduce blood pressure, decrease serum lipid levels and modulate immune responses [51] .",

A study conducted in South Africa determined the effect of African Potato on efavirenz pharmacokinetics. Ten healthy volunteers participated in this singledose, two-phase sequential study over 31 days [17] . Efavirenz is a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) effective against HIV-1. It is the backbone of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) in Africa and is mainly metabolized by CYP2B6 and to a lesser extent CYP3A4 [54] . For the South African study, the following parameters were used to determine interactions: AUC 0-48 , C max , T max , T 1/2, and K el . The results indicated that the 90% confidence intervals (CI) for C max and AUC 0-48 were within the limits of 80-125% interval. Thus, the investigators concluded that the African Potato did not alter efavirenz pharmacokinetics. The investigators recommended that further research is needed to investigate African Potato and other antiretrovirals especially those that are P-gp substrates or CYP3A4 metabolites [17] . Although this study had a clear and concise methodology, the sample size calculations were not well explained, especially considering the intra-individual variability of the AUC and C max for efavirenz. In addition, single-dose studies do not consider induction that occurs during chronic dosing.",

Lopinavir/ ritonavir is a potent HIV protease inhibitor combination that is used with other antiretrovirals for the treatment of HIV infection. Lopinavir (LPV) increases ritonavir (RTV) concentrations through inhibition of CYP3A4. LPV is metabolized primarily by hepatic and gastrointestinal CYP3A4. They hypothesized that since in vitro studies indicate that extracts of African Potato have a significant inhibitory effect on CYP3A4 this could lead to an increase in exposure, associated with an increased cholesterol/ diabetes risk. This study was an open-label, two-period; fixed sequence, crossover pharmacokinetic drug interaction study. Sixteen healthy, HIV-seronegative adult volunteers between 18 to 60 years were enrolled. The following parameters were used to determine interactions: AUC 0-18 , C max , C trough , T max , T 1/2 , CL F and K el . Results indicated that steady-state plasma concentrationtime profiles of LPV with and without African Potato were similar as reflected by the 90% confidence intervals that were within the 80-125% limit. The effect on ritonavir was not analyzed in this study. Total cholesterol and triglycerides were elevated but within limits during LPV/r treatment [18] . The investigators concluded that African Potato had no significant effect on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of LPV. This study was well designed although the results cannot be generalized to other populations. It would have been ideal to use participants from Africa, where African Potato use is prevalent. Clinical studies involving African Potato or its constituents are summarized in Table 4 .",

A survey conducted among traditional healers in South Africa was used to calculate the dose of African Potato. An average of about 20 g of freshly shredded African potato boiled in 250 mL of water was prescribed for daily consumption. African potato was mainly prescribed to boost immunity [37] . For the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia, African Potato dosed at 20 mg of \u03b2-sitosterol three times a AUC area under the concentration-time curve within a dosing interval, BPH benign prostatic hyperplasia, BSS \u03b2-sitosterol, BSSG \u03b2-sitosterol glucoside, C max maximum concentration following dose administration, C trough plasma concentration at the end of the dosing interval, CL F apparent clearance, IPSS International Prostate Symptom Score, K el elimination rate constant, LPV/r ritonavir-boosted lopinavir, PTB pulmonary tuberculosis, T max time to reach C max , T 1/2half-life day was found to be therapeutic [19] . According to literature, an oral dose of 15 mg/ kg/ day is reportedly therapeutic [18] ; however, it is unknown whether this dose is effective for all the claims against African Potato. Other sources state that 2400 mg taken daily is therapeutic [15] . Standardized capsules are available online which contain from 300 to 350 mg hypoxis hemerocallidea. The doses for these formulations vary; some stating one capsule twice daily and some stating two tablets 3 times a day for the first 5 days, then one tablet 3 times a day [42, 43] . In South Africa, herbal formulations of African Potato are mainly used to enhance the immune system. The herbal formulations are available as capsules, tonics, creams and tinctures containing 300-500 mg hypoxis hemerocallidea or sterols/ sterolins [38] .",
