Cytokine storm syndrome (CSS) is a critical clinical symptom of severe 13 COVID-19 patients, and the macrophage is recognized as the direct host cell of SARS-CoV-2 and potential drivers of CSS. In the present study, 14 peramivir was identified to reduce TNF-\u03b1 by partly intervention of NF-\u03baB activity in LPS-induced macrophage model. In vivo, peramivir 15 reduced the multi-cytokines in serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), alleviated the acute lung injury and prolonged the survival time 16 2 in mice. In human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs), peramivir could also inhibit the release of TNF-\u03b1.

The results showed peramivir had the best ability to inhibit TNF-\u03b1 by ~70% among the three compounds. 56 Furthermore, we estimated the anti-cytokine storm effect and lung protection of peramivir in vivo. The anti-inflammatory effect of peramivir in 57 human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (hPBMCs) was also observed. ",

The reduction in TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b3 and 200 MCP-1 levels promoted by peramivir might play an important role in reducing stress due to the overactivated immune system and preventing 201 organ damage of infected mice. This hypothesis was confirmed by pathological examination and lung index evaluation, which found that 202 treatment with peramivir alleviated the severity of LPS-associated pneumonia and prolonged the survival time for mice. The lethal lung 203 pathology caused by LPS was due to the excessive cytokine response that was primarily produced by the activated macrophages. 28 Peramivir 204 inhibited the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 in the BALF of LPS-induced mice. Furthermore, peramivir attenuated TNF-\u03b1 induced by LPS both in 205 mouse peritoneal macrophages and hPBMCs, which confirmed that peramivir can inhibit the inflammatory cytokine response mediated by 206 macrophages.207In conclusion, the modulatory function of peramivir on LPS-induced inflammatory cytokines might contribute to the additional beneficial effect 208 of the drug in antiviral therapy.
