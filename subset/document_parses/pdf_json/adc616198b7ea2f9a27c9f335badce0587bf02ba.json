The review revealed that masks disrupt verbal and non-verbal communication, as well as emotional and social wellbeing and they impact people with hearing loss more than those without. These findings are presumably because opaque masks attenuate sound at frequencies above 1 kHz, and conceal the mouth and lips making lipreading impossible, and limit visibility of facial expressions. While surgical masks cause relatively little sound attenuation, transparent masks and face shields are highly attenuating. However, they are preferred by people with hearing loss because they give access to visual cues.",

            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) a pandemic on March 11, 2020 (1) . In response, the WHO and many governments around the world rapidly developed guidelines about use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and other measures (e.g., physical/social distancing) to decrease the spread of the virus. Although details of the guidelines varied across the globe, almost all countries recommended that face coverings (masks) be worn indoors and/or when in close proximity to others. While lowering the risk of infection (2) , these measures can disrupt communication by altering transmission of the acoustical signal, preventing lipreading, limiting the interpretation of facial expressions, and changing social cues and nuances (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Published studies examining the impacts of preventative measures (i.e., PPE/face coverings and/or distancing) on communication have been conducted using a variety of approaches, as reviewed below. These included acoustic measures of sound transmissions through masks, performance-based testing of speech understanding and face recognition, and surveys of the general public, healthcare professionals and patients. Many studies have focused on the impacts of preventive measures on communication in health care settings, some examined healthcare professional (HCP)-HCP communication, while others have addressed HCP-to-patient communication.",

Given the global burden of hearing loss, affecting more than 20% of the global population (10, 11) , consideration of the impact of preventative measures on communication for people with hearing loss is a priority. To date however only a handful of studies have directly addressed this (6, (12) (13) (14) . While transparent face masks have been proposed as a potential solution to alleviate communication problems associated with covering the face and lips (6) , data suggest that the materials used in transparent face masks are acoustically more attenuating than materials used in non-transparent masks (3, 15) , thus potentially negating their benefit.",

The Rayyan software was used to screen these unique references and to record decisions about inclusion. The initial screening was based on the content of the title and abstract. A full text review followed. Papers were included if they met the following criteria: (a) primary research study published in a peer-reviewed journal; (b) impacts of PPE and distancing on communication were assessed in some manner, and (c) the full-text article was available in English. Studies focusing on audiological and/or vestibular symptoms (e.g., hearing loss and/or tinnitus) arising from COVID-19 and studies examining the impact of respirators and alternative experimental face coverings were excluded. Authors IO and GS screened the studies independently. Discrepancies were then discussed. When further resolution was required, as in the case of four studies, authors VM and DS made a final decision.",

Broadly, the surveys and semi-structured interviews indicated that disrupted speech communication between HCPs is among the most common problems arising from use of PPE in a medical context. One study that focused on hearing loss showed that use of opaque face masks resulted in HCPs who are D/deaf feeling fearful of making errors during their medical practice, and that the level of anxiety reported was strongly associated with degree of hearing loss (26) . Almost none of the respondents worked in a location that had access to transparent masks (26) . The two studies that explored the impact of social distancing in combination with use of PPE indicated that both negatively affected communication and interpersonal relationships in healthcare contexts (24, 30) . Finally, two studies reported that opaque face masks lead to difficulties recognizing colleagues (30, 31) .",

The two exceptions used semi-structured interviews, with one supplementing this with information from media reports and government policies (31, 38) . Nine of the ten studies reported that PPE and/or distancing caused barriers to effective verbal and non-verbal communication with patients, especially for HCPs who are D/deaf (26) , and that it negatively impacted psychosocial factors such as trust and rapport, and resulted in patients (including pediatric patients) feeling fearful/anxious during appointments. A study by Kratzke et al. (36) revealed that using transparent masks instead of opaque masks had positive impacts on HCP-patient interactions, leading to improved understanding and increased trust and perceived empathy. Two studies addressed communication between HCPs and patients with hearing loss. Results indicated that HCPs had become more aware of communication difficulties associated with hearing loss since the start of the pandemic. This was attributed to face masks muffling speech, preventing lipreading, and making encounters longer (31, 32) . ",

The four studies that used behavioral measures determined that face masks decreased the ability to recognize emotions, reduced perceived interpersonal closeness, and decreased facial mimicry during communication. Further, when masks were used during oral examinations, students perceived their test performance to be negatively impacted, although in fact, test scores were unaffected (40) .",

Three studies examined the impacts of face coverings and/or social distancing on general communication. They indicated masks and social distancing exacerbated the communication difficulties people with hearing loss already experience, and that this negatively affects quality of life, willingness to engage in social interactions, and leads to emotional and psychosocial challenges (12, 43, 44) . Studies also showed that challenges arise in healthcare and education settings (12, 45) , as well as during virtual communication (43) . One study showed the impacts of preventive measures to be significantly greater for people with hearing loss than for those without (12) , and another reported on the practical issues that arise from wearing hearing aids with a mask (46) . People with hearing loss indicated a preference for HCPs to use transparent masks during appointments (44) , and despite communication problems, most hearing aid users prioritized their hearing health as reflected in their attending audiology appointments (46) . Interestingly, two studies reported that distancing measures impacted communication positively for people with hearing loss, because communication was taking place in quieter situations, with consequent improved speech understanding and less perceived listening effort (44, 47) .",

The results showed that, to varying extents, masks and face shields attenuated the transmission of sound frequencies above 1 kHz. Transparent plastic face shields attenuated sounds the most (49, 51) , surgical masks the least (3, 6, 9, 15, 48, 55) . Generally, transparent face masks, N95 masks, and cloth masks fell somewhere between (3, 9, 15, 48, 52, 55) . The attenuating effect of a cloth mask depended on the type and weave of the cloth and on its fit, with masks made from breathable fabrics such as cotton and masks with pleats, having better acoustic performance than non-breathable, non-pleated masks (3, 55) . Not surprisingly, the attenuating effect of wearing a face mask in combination with a face shield was cumulative (49, 54, 56) . The directionality of sound attenuation was assessed by two studies which showed that attenuation was the greatest toward the front for all masks, and that plastic face shields deflect and amplify sound behind the talker (3, 15) . Finally, three studies investigated the impact of face masks on voice/vocal effort used when wearing a mask (50, 52, 53) . These studies showed masks did not change the acoustical properties of the voice. However, participants reported decreased vocal intensity and increased vocal effort and dyspnea when speaking wearing a mask.",

In general, the results showed the same as those of the acoustic measures, namely that face coverings had a detrimental effect on speech understanding. However, in some instances, the decrement in the acoustic signal did not translate into decreased speech understanding scores. As further described below, the impact face coverings had on speech understanding depended on the type of face covering, the listening condition (quiet vs. noise) and the hearing status of the listener. With just two exceptions (54, 59) , studies showed that surgical masks had no impact on speech understanding in quiet for people with normal hearing (52, 61) and little or Surveys (n = 8), semi-structured interviews (n = 1), combined interviews and media reports (n = 1)",

Five studies included people with hearing loss (6, 13, 14, 51, 56) . Three of these showed masks to be detrimental to speech understanding (6, 14, 51) , and three showed speech understanding to be improved with a transparent mask/face shield relative to an opaque mask (6, 14, 51) . The combination of a face mask plus face shield also resulted in decreased speech understanding in quiet for cochlear implant users relative to a no-mask or mask-only condition (56) . Three studies combined behavioral testing with quantitative self-report questions. They showed that opaque masks resulted in subjective difficulties, the need for increased concentration/listening effort, and decreased confidence in understanding relative to no mask and/or transparent masks. This was the case regardless of hearing status (14, 48, 59) . In addition, two studies examined the interaction between face masks and speech style (58, 61) . Results indicated using a clear speaking style when wearing a mask resulted in improved speech understanding for people with normal hearing relative to a masked conversational speaking style and no mask conditions. One study revealed that PPE affected speech understanding in simulated hospital environments with high background noise levels (60) .",

From an acoustic perspective, face coverings reduce transmission of the speech signal at frequencies above 1 kHz which has consequences for hearing the speech signal (3, 15) . In some studies this is reflected in poorer performance on speech understanding tests (14, 48) , but not always (13, 55, 61) . It depends on the material of the mask, the listening conditions and hearing status. Specifically, surgical masks have little impact on speech understanding performance, cloth/fabric masks, face shields and/or mask-face shield combinations have more; speech in noise is more affected than speech in quiet; and people with hearing loss are more affected than people with normal hearing. The picture is more complex when considering transparent masks in that while they attenuate sound more than opaque masks (3, 6, 15, 56) , people with hearing loss benefit from their use (6, 14) . This is presumably because the mouth and lips are visible allowing for use of lipreading and other non-verbal cues (6, 14) .",

They showed that distancing compounds the negative effects of masking on audibility and communication, in everyday life (42, 43) , and in educational contexts, especially for students with hearing loss (45) . This is presumably because increased distance between a speaker and a listener leads to a decrease in signal to noise ratio, thus affecting audibility and speech understanding. However, it is noteworthy that people with hearing loss reported a positive impact of distancing measures on their communication as it resulted in spending more time in favorable (quieter) listening environments with consequent better speech understanding and reduced listening effort (44, 47) . In fact, one study found COVID-19 distancing measures reduced environmental sounds levels \u2022 Reduce background noise where possible, especially in situations where important information is conveyed (e.g., healthcare and education contexts) to support better speech understanding and relieve anxiety around hearing. This can be achieved through environmental modifications (e.g., use soft furnishings) and turning off extraneous sound sources (e.g., radio, TV). \u2022 Select the type of mask based on communication needs.",

Furthermore, given the nature of scoping review, a critical appraisal of studies was not undertaken and therefore we do not comment on the quality of the included studies. As the majority of the included studies were published during the COVID-19 pandemic, rapid measures without baseline measures were conducted, often online/virtually. Therefore, most studies included in this review used survey measures while randomized clinical trial studies were limited. Interpreting findings from survey studies should be highly evidence based, and limitations associated with surveys should be acknowledged, e.g., recall accuracy, sampling bias etc. Future studies should consider planning and execution of studies to accommodate studies of stronger design to produce higher level of evidence (e.g., pre-vs. post-test design). There is a need for further research and development of transparent masks with improved acoustic characteristics to help eliminate the trade-off between clarity of sound and access to visual cues. In addition, studies considering the effect of amplification on speech understanding difficulties caused by face coverings is limited, therefore future studies should explore this as well as. The impact of preventative measures on communication for people with unilateral hearing loss is unknown. Therefore, future studies should consider including people with unilateral hearing loss, with possible comparisons to people with normal hearing and people with bilateral hearing loss.",

However, these impact verbal and non-verbal communication in everyday life, with the most substantial effects in healthcare settings and for people with hearing loss. As these measures are likely to be a feature in everyday life for the foreseeable future and as the impacts extend beyond hearing and speech understanding difficulties, the use of carefully selected face coverings should be supplemented with augmentative compensatory strategies to support clear and effective communication. Research is also required for development of masks that have better acoustic characteristics while allowing access to visual cues. This can help mitigate negative psychosocial effects and improve quality of care during the uncertain and stressful COVID-19 times.",

These include speaking slowly and clearlyshouting does not help someone with hearing loss, use gestures, when repeating a statement rephrase rather than repeat verbatim, write down key information for patients who are struggling, and do not assume that the absence of a hearing aid indicates good hearing, or that a nod implies a person has heard and understood what was said (37, 38, 58, 61). \u2022 Consider whether virtual/remote medical consultations in some instances might yield more successful communication than in-person masked consultations (12, 44, 65) especially if published guidelines for communication during phone and video consultations are followed (66-69). Furthermore, HCPs should counsel people with hearing loss about the value of live subtitling in virtual communications/video calls to further improve their speech understanding (44).",
