            "text": "Strain echocardiography enables the automatic quantification of the global longitudinal strain (GLS), which is a direct measure of ventricular shortening during systole. In the current context of overwhelmed ICUs and clinician shortage, GLS has the advantage to be quick and easy to measure by non-experts. However, little is known regarding its value to assess bi-ventricular systolic function in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Therefore, we designed a study to compare right and left ventricular GLS with classic echo-Doppler indices of systolic function, namely the ejection fraction for the left ventricle (LVEF) and the fractional area change (FAC), the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and the tissue Doppler velocity of the basal free lateral wall (S') for the right ventricle. Eighty transthoracic echocardiographic evaluations done in 30 ICU patients with COVID-19 were analyzed. We observed a fair relationship (r = 0.73, p < 0.01) between LVEF and left ventricular GLS. The GLS cut-off value of \u2212 22% identified a LVEF < 50% with a sensitivity of 63% and a specificity of 80%. All patients with a GLS > \u2212 17% had a LVEF < 50%. Although statistically significant, relationships between FAC (r = 0.41, p < 0.01), TAPSE (r = 0.26, p < 0.05) and right ventricular GLS were weak. S' was not correlated with right ventricular GLS. In conclusion, left ventricular GLS was useful to assess left ventricular systolic function. However, right ventricular GLS was poorly correlated with FAC, TAPSE and S'. Further studies are needed to clarify what is the best method to assess right ventricular systolic function in ICU patients with COVID-19.",

The GLS is a quantification of myocardial longitudinal shortening during systole [1, 2] . GLS values are expressed as a negative percentage (shortening) and usually range between \u2212 20 and \u2212 30% for both ventricles. Less negative values (e.g. \u2212 15%) indicate a decrease in longitudinal shortening [1, 2] . The GLS is automatically calculated by modern echocardiographic software from a single cardiac view (Fig. 1) . In this respect, the estimation of GLS has been shown to be quicker and less operator-dependent than the estimation of classic echo-Doppler indices of ventricular function [3, 4] . It may therefore boost the adoption and improve the accuracy of Point Of Care UltraSound (POCUS) evaluations which, in surgical and critically ill patients, are increasingly done by non-cardiologists [5, 6] .",

Transthoracic echocardiographic evaluations were performed in COVID-19 patients admitted in the ICU of Hospital Garcia de Orta. All adult patients admitted between June and September 2020 were screened for eligibility. Patients admitted for acute myocardial infarction or pulmonary embolism with a positive COVID-19 Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) swab test were excluded from the study, as well as patients in whom good quality transthoracic images were impossible to obtain. For all remaining COVID-19 patients, we performed an echocardiography the day of admission, then at day 3 and day 7. All ultrasound recordings and measurements were done by skilled operators and reviewed by one of us (FG) who holds the European Diploma in Advanced Critical Care Echocardiography. A 2D wall motion tracking software (Xario 200, Canon Medical Systems, Otawara, Japan) was used to assess right and left ventricular GLS from a 4-cavity apical view. The endocardial border was automatically detected using 3 reference points (basal septum, basal free wall and apex) and manually adjusted, if deemed necessary, by the operator. Then, the software automatically performed speckle tracking on a frame-to-frame basis. Traditional indices of systolic function were also assessed, namely the ejection fraction for the left ventricle (LVEF) and the fractional area change (FAC), the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE), and the tissue Doppler velocity of the basal free lateral wall (S') for the right ventricle [10] .",

A quick POCUS cardiac evaluation is therefore highly desirable in this context, but a surge of acutely ill patients may limit the feasibility of an operatordependent and time-consuming procedure [14] . Recent studies suggest that a decrease in right and left ventricular GLS is an independent predictive factor of tracheal intubation and in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients [7, 8] . The ability to quickly assess both right and left ventricular function with strain echocardiography, regardless of the operator training level [3, 4] , is therefore very appealing in this context. Our findings suggest that left ventricular GLS may provide actionable information about left ventricular systolic function in ICU patients with COVID-19. They are consistent with the results of previous reports done in cardiac patients [4] and with a recent meta-analysis of studies done in critically ill patients with severe sepsis and septic shock [2] suggesting that left ventricular GLS is a reliable marker of left ventricular systolic function. The GLS is a direct measure of myocardial shortening. In contrast, the LVEF is calculated from the end-systolic and end-diastolic volumes. In addition, the geometric assumptions made by the disc Simpson's method may not hold true for all patients [2] . The LVEF is therefore an indirect measure of systolic function. When the GLS was > \u2212 17%, the LVEF was always < 50%. Conversely, when the LVEF was < 50% the GLS was < \u2212 20% during 16 evaluations (20%), and < \u2212 25% during 7 evaluations (9%). Therefore, although significantly correlated, the two indices were not interchangeable, and the lack of reference method does not allow us to conclude which one was the best marker of left ventricular systolic function. Finally, the reproducibility of measurements was not better for left ventricular GLS than for LVEF.",

We observed a significant discrepancy between the information provided by TAPSE and S' on one hand, and by FAC and right ventricular GLS on the other hand. Indeed, TAPSE and S' were abnormally low in only 5% of our evaluations, whereas FAC and right ventricular GLS were abnormal during around 1/4 of the evaluations. TAPSE is widely used to assess right ventricular systolic function [10] . However, both in chronic heart failure and cardiac surgical patients, TAPSE has been shown to be less sensitive to detect right ventricular dysfunction and less accurate to predict outcome than right ventricular GLS [15, 16] . In addition, in a recent study done in 282 critically ill patients with septic shock, TAPSE was unable to discriminate patients with or without right ventricular failure [17] . The lack of sensitivity of TAPSE and S' to detect systolic dysfunction may be related to the fact that they only represent a small portion of the right ventricle (regional assessment of systolic function), as well as to the angle dependency of their measurements [18, 19] . The FAC is calculated from the endsystolic and end-diastolic area measurements and, therefore, like the LVEF, is an indirect measure of systolic function. In contrast, the right ventricular GLS is a direct measure of myocardial shortening. However, it includes the interventricular septum shortening and is therefore influenced by left ventricular systolic function [20] . Whether a better correlation with FAC could be observed when restricting strain measurements to the right ventricular free wall remains to be determined.",

First, GLS measurements have been shown to be software dependent [19] , so Right: Correlations between the right ventricular fractional area change (FAC), the tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and RV GLS that we cannot exclude that our findings may have been different if we had used a different commercially available speckle tracking software. Second, echocardiographic evaluations were performed by experienced operators, which may explain why the intra-observer reproducibility of measurements was as good for classic indices than for GLS measurements. Further studies would be useful to investigate whether the reproducibility might be better for strain than for classic measurements when evaluations are done by trainees or echo beginners. Finally, several studies have suggested that the right ventricular GLS is a better marker of systolic dysfunction than the FAC [16] or even than the 3D right ventricular ejection fraction [1] . In our study, the lack of gold standard method, such as magnetic resonance imaging [1] , does not allow us to draw any definitive conclusion regarding the respective value of GLS and FAC to assess right ventricular systolic function.",

The right ventricular GLS was weakly correlated with FAC, poorly with TAPSE, and was not correlated in any way with S'. Further studies are needed to clarify whether FAC or right ventricular GLS may preferentially be used for the assessment of right ventricular systolic function in ICU patients with COVID-19.
