            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is an emerging pathogen that is spreading worldwide. It is primarily transmitted by respiratory droplets and by direct and indirect contact; however, airborne transmission can also occur in the context of aerosol generating medical procedures (AGMPs), necessitating the usage of N95 respirators for protection of healthcare workers (HCWs). [1] The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused a global shortage of N95 respirators [1] that can represent a risk to healthcare workers performing AGMP. [2] To solve this shortage, alternative strategies have been considered such as decontamination with vaporized hydrogen peroxide (VHP) based on promising pre-existing research available. [3] [4] [5] [6] This technique was able to reduce pathogen burden while maintaining filtration performance. [6] The respirator fit and elastic band integrity, as measured on a surrogate robotic manikin headform, were also determined to be maintained for up to 20 decontamination cycles. [3, 6] Based on these encouraging data, the FDA and Health Canada have approved the emergency use authorization (EUA) of some VHP decontamination systems such as the STERIS V-PRO\u00ae maX Low Temperature Sterilization System. These VHP methods allow cellulose-free N95 respirators to be decontaminated and re-utilized up to 10 times. [7, 8] However, the aforementioned studies supporting these claims were mainly performed in laboratory settings and may overestimate post-decontamination quality of respirator fit, as the respirators were not used for extended periods between decontamination cycles. [3] [4] [5] [6] In the absence of specific manufacturer guidance, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends limiting respirator reusage to no more than five times to ensure an adequate safety margin. [9] 6 The current trend in healthcare settings is to promote the extended use of respirators to maximize their lifespan, and HCWs are encouraged to wear respirators for many consecutive hours before removing them and sending them for decontamination. [10] However, to our knowledge, no studies have considered the impact of the combination of prolonged usage and decontamination on respirator qualitative fit test. These physical and chemical stressors can deform the respirators and decrease tensile strength of the elastic bands, thereby affecting the user's fit to the respirator.",

Participants were then re-fit-tested on the mask they previously used to assess the respirator's structural and functional integrity. Each cycle, which consisted of a 4-hour period of respirator use, the decontamination with VHP, and fit-testing after decontamination, was repeated until failure of the fit test occurred (e.g., leak detected on fittest) or mechanical failure of the respirator was detected (e.g., rupture of the elastic bands). The occurrence of either of these two aspects determined the end of the study for that participant.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] We also detected wide variation between brands in the number of cycles that can be performed before failure, which questions the \"one size fits all\" recommendations that have been published. [4] [5] [6] Changes in respirator fitting over multiple donnings and prolonged wear have been associated with an increased fit test failure. [9, 12, 13] Respirators cannot provide optimal protection without a proper seal and most aerosolized contaminants that enter a worn N95 respirator result from seal leakage rather than insufficient filtration performancethe latter of which is preserved for up to 50 cycles with VHP decontamination. [6, 14] As the capacity to decontaminate respirators is further hampered by mechanical failures, our study indicates that the number of decontamination cycles that can be safely performed is lower than previously reported.",

While they acknowledge the evidence for decontamination from laboratory studies, they cite a pilot study in the Netherlands which showed that VHP is effective for two decontamination cycles without deformation while retaining filtration efficacy as assessed by a rapid fit test. [15] The similarity to our findings may suggest that laboratory-based studies may correlate poorly with actual clinical use and may overestimate the quality of the fit. One of the strengths of our study was the 14 extended usage of the respirator, which simulated a regular workday with everyday movements and frequent donning-doffing, which may have contributed to a diminished respirator fit.",

This is contrary to the previous studies which suggested that 1860(S) model was compatible with VHP decontamination [4] [5] [6] . The N95 1870+, Moldex 151X and ProGear were more tolerant to extended use and decontamination, with the Moldex having the highest number of cycles completed before 50% failure. The ProGear reached 3 cycles with 100% fit test passing rate.

Larger studies are needed to better understand the individual impact of donning and doffing, prolonged use and reprocessing on the fit test of N95 respirators. Finally, implementing a decontamination process for N95 respirators is a decision that is made locally amongst shared stakeholders which will depend on the reprocessing processes and equipment that is available, the supply of respirators, the local hospital situation with input from the local public health authorities with regards to outbreaks of COVID19. Alternative options should be explored to protect our health care workers in preparation for the current or next pandemics such as respirator stewardship or reusable respirator.",

The second figure only included failures of fit testing (and censored mechanical failures) to explore the number of times respirators could be reprocessed before loss of fit testing. In both figures, in case of loss to follow-up, participants were censored at the beginning of each next cycle. RESULTS Overall, 36 healthcare workers, including 15 physicians (41.7%), 20 registered nurses (55.6%) and 1 beneficiary attendant (2.8%), completed a total of 360 hours of respirator usage across 90 cycles. The majority of participants were female (59.5%). The respirator models distribution were 1860(S) (25.0%), 1870+ (27.8%), Moldex 151X (27.8%) and ProGear (19.4%). The median (interquartile range [IQR]) of intra-cycle respirator donning, excluding the initial donning was 2 (IQR, 1 to 3). By the end of the study, 23/36 (64%) participants had met the primary endpoint (18 due to failure of fit test post decontamination, and 5 due to mechanical failure). 12 participants were lost to follow up because they were deployed to care for COVID-19",

Individuals were then qualitatively fit tested to the reprocessed mask. Loss to mechanical failure was censored and this was visually represented with a mid-cycle \"X\". Individuals lost to follow-up were censored and this was visually depicted on the survival curves with a cross (median number of cycles completed by participants before mechanical or fit test failure was 2. With the inclusion only of fit test failure (and exclusion of mechanical failures), the median number of decontamination cycles that could be performed before fit test failure was 4. However, there was a marked variation between respirator models in the number of cycles that could be performed before respirator failure. The overall number of cycles required for half of respirators to fail for the models 1860(S), 1870+, Moldex 151X and ProGear, was 1, 3, 5 and 4, respectively (Figure 1). When mechanical failure was censured, the overall number of cycles required for half of respirators to fail fit testing was 1, 4, 5 and 4 for the 1860(S), 1870+, Moldex 151X and ProGear, respectively (Figure 2). Finally, the proportion of masks that failed fit testing after a single cycle of extended use and decontamination was 66% for the 1860, 22% for the 1870+ and the Moldex, and 0% for the ProGear(Figure 2). Given the preliminary high failure rate with the 1860 model, 5 fit tests for this model were performed immediately at the end of the first 4h period of use (i.e. before VHP reprocessing): All these participants (5/5) passed the qualitative fit test.Overall, the user seal check was concordant with the qualitative fit test in 81.3% (n=75) of cases.Participants were able to detect leakage on seal check in 4 occasions, all of which corresponded to failure with the qualitative fit testing. However, the user seal check failed to predict fit test failure in 14 of 18 cases (77.8%) of fit test failures",
