This study aimed to determine the effect of the pandemic on adolescent eating disorders (EDs) by measuring changes in the number and severity of presentations to an Australian paediatric ED service that utilises a standardised approach to triage and assessment. Methods: A 4-year retrospective chart review (2017-2020) of all patients (n = 457) presenting to the Royal Children's Hospital Eating Disorder Service, Melbourne, was undertaken. The incidence of each diagnosis and measures of condition severity were extracted from the database and patient medical records. Clinical comments relating to the impact of COVID-19, on both ED behaviours and treatment, were also noted. Results: Annual presentations increased from a mean of 98.7 per annum from 2017 to 2019 to 161 in 2020 (63% increase). COVID-19 restrictions were reported to be a trigger for ED behaviours in 40.4% of adolescents diagnosed with anorexia nervosa in 2020. There was no significant difference in severity across years despite increased cases. Conclusions: The dramatic increase in presentations has implications for primary health and paediatric care as well as specialist ED services. Increased support is needed for EDs during this time.",

This is disconcerting given adolescence is a crucial period for social and emotional development, during which the foundations for mental well-being are established. 6 The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching consequences for population mental health and well-being in Australia and globally. High levels of depression and anxiety have been seen, and a small number of reports have suggested an increase in the incidence of AN in adolescents presenting to services. 4 ,7 Yet concurrently concerns about the risk of COVID-19 transmission within health facilities might also result in delayed presentation for assessment, with the risk of increased severity at the eventual time of diagnosis.",

Depression and anxiety were the most commonly diagnosed comorbid mental health conditions at assessment, with more than 20% and 30% of patients affected, respectively. The overall incidence of mental health comorbidities at diagnosis did not differ by year (P = 0.95). The incidence of medical comorbidities also did not differ by year, and the proportion of patients prescribed medications was similarly unchanged (P = 0.92). Table 3 reports the proportion of patients with AN fulfilling each BMI classification. This was not reported for patients with atypical AN as by definition patients in this group are not underweight despite being malnourished. The distribution of BMI differed significantly across the study period (P < 0.005). In all 4 years, the largest proportion of AN patients was mildly malnourished with 36-38.9% recording a BMI \u226517 kg/m 2 . In 2017 and 2018, extremely malnourished patients (BMI <15 kg/m 2 ) were more common than severely (BMI 15-15.99 kg/m 2 ) and moderately (BMI 16-16.99 kg/m 2 ) malnourished patients. In 2019, moderately malnourished patients accounted for a larger proportion of cases (30%). On the other hand, while in 2020 there was a relatively even distribution of patients with moderately, severely and extremely malnourished BMI classifications (18.9-22.2%), the proportion of extremely malnourished patients (20%) was lower than for the previous 3 years (24-31.7%). Table 4 summarises the reported reasons for the onset of AN and atypical AN during 2020. Feelings of social isolation and loneliness was the most prominent reason reported for the onset of an ED (32.3%), followed by a change in normal routines and subsequent lack of motivation (25.6%). Cessation of community sport, along with boredom and minimal distraction from AN thoughts, were additional reasons reported for the onset of ED behaviours. A few patients also reported reduced food availability as a factor (3%). Furthermore, in 40.4% of patients assessed in 2020, it was reported that 'The onset of [patient's] eating disorder behaviours coincided with the COVID lockdown'. A further 12.8% of patients recorded a relapse in progress during the COVID-19 lockdown. This was summarised as a 'COVID setback' by clinicians and entailed either an exacerbation of existing ED behaviours or the transition from one form of ED to a restrictive-type. Comments from patients and their families such as '[patient] became fearful of expected weight gain during isolation' and 'worried about getting fat and losing fitness' highlighted lockdown was commonly considered to be a precipitating factor. Temporary easing of restrictions in June was reported to have 'helped with reducing AN cognitions and improving mood' for many patients; although, 'this only made lockdown 2.0 worse'.",

This corresponds to a series of COVID-19-related events in Melbourne, Australia. During the initial months of the year, vast media coverage of the evolving global situation led to a sense of uncertainty and anxiety among many Australians 4,5 ; many people avoided going out, including for health care, which may explain the decrease in new presentations with AN and atypical AN between February and April. However, this was offset by a dramatic increase in the number of presentations in the second half of the year following the implementation of stringent COVID-19 restrictions, which were considered relevant in 40.4% of adolescents in 2020.",

            "text": "To date, Australia has managed to avoid high rates of mortality from COVID-19 due to the imposition of border closures and quarantine, and intense social restrictions. Indeed, Melbourne's COVID-19 restrictions in 2020 were among the longest lasting and most intense in any population. The impact of social restrictions, including school closures, on young people is evident in this study, as more than one-third of these adolescents reported isolation and loneliness, and almost a quarter reported boredom. This is consistent with the longstanding recognition that isolation, loneliness and boredom are triggers for disordered eating behaviours in the general population. [10] [11] [12] [13] Many individuals who develop EDs have inherently rigid thought processes in relation to food and/or exercise, [14] [15] [16] which may also explain why abrupt changes to normal routines as a result of COVID-19 restrictions may have been so challenging; over a quarter of these patients suggested that changes to normal routines contributed to the onset of an ED. In addition to food insecurity, frequent media reports about dieting (e.g. how to 'avoid the bulge during lockdown') may also have contributed to weight loss, which is a known trigger to restrictive EDs. 12, [17] [18] [19] While the decline in new cases from September may reflect the easing of restrictions and an anticipated return to previous routines, the reduction in cases remained modest by the end of 2020.",

This may indicate that COVID-19 restrictions tended to trigger the onset of behaviours rather than exacerbate symptoms in those with pre-existing ED behaviours. The high proportion of 2020 patients (40.4%) who were reported to develop AN or atypical AN during lockdown, as opposed to those who relapsed (12.8%), further supports this notion, as does the lesser proportion of extremely malnourished AN patients in 2020 compared to previous years. It may also be that ED behaviours were identified earlier due to the opportunities to observe individual behaviours when family members are locked down together.",

The validity of these findings is enhanced by the longstanding use of a standardised approach to triage and patient assessment within the RCH ED service, which offers clinical care to a specific geographical region in Melbourne. However, reports of when and why ED behaviours developed relied on documentation within the medical record and these data may therefore not fully represent the implications of the pandemic. Chart notes regarding the triggers for ED behaviours in 2020 could also have reflected the expectations or biases of the clinicians. Nevertheless, prominent themes were able to be identified from the medical records, which bring attention to the particular challenges faced by adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Beyond the immediate need for patient care around COVID-19 itself, it highlights the wider impacts of the pandemic on mental disorders in a cohort that might not otherwise have developed AN. Understanding the recovery of the 2020 cohort will be important, as it will have occurred in the context of further episodic lockdowns in Melbourne. So too, as the pandemic rolls on, it will be important to understand the impact of repeated social and educational disruptions on EDs in young people.",
