Public health and disease prevention and control systems in different countries have different performances in response to the pandemic, but they all have exposed many shortcomings. Countries around the world urgently need to improve the monitoring, early warning and emergency response systems for new major infectious diseases. As the outpost and main part of medical rescue, the hospital urgently needs to establish a set of scientifically advanced emergency response mechanism that is suitable for the business process of the medical system and unified standards in order to improve the response efficiency and quality of emergency treatment.",

After arduous efforts, China paid a huge price and sacrifice, and effectively reversed the situation of the epidemic [51] . With the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the joint efforts of the people across the country, the domestic epidemic situation has been effectively controlled, but the shortcomings and deficiencies exposed therein still need to be considered. It is urgent to improve monitoring, early warning and emergency response system for new major infectious diseases, build an effective monitoring and early warning network for new major infectious diseases, and move forward the prevention and control gate. China emergency management system still has many shortcomings: (1) The organizational system is not perfect [52] , such as general hospitals do not set up health emergency management departments independently [53] , lack of comprehensive coordination and command institutions and information management centers, etc., and the current \"segmented\" emergency management mode lacks effective coordination and cooperation mechanism and recovery mechanism [23] . (2) The emergency plan and implementation evaluation are not perfect, there is a tendency of \"preplanning\", there is a lack of emergency drill and objective evaluation, and the emergency response capacity of new major infectious diseases is not strong [54] . (3) The support system is relatively backward, there is no prior funding support system [55] , the provision of professional personnel and emergency material resources is inconsistent with the implementation of emergency tasks, the information system sharing system between hospitals and departments of disease control, transportation, public security and other departments is not perfect; The information release and public opinion guidance need to be strengthened [56] . (4) Other weak links, such as the definition of responsibility system function of medical institutions in the emergency process, the research and development of new drugs and new equipment, the weak foundation of information support [57] , the lack of clear key elements and tasks of information integration and efficient utilization, the upgrading of hospital infection control, and the lack of corresponding task list and model guidance for emergency support of materials.",
