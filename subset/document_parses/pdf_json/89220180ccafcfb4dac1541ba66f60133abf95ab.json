As retirements, mass quarantines and absence due to sickness during pandemics, or other shocks thin out these networks, the system might be pushed closer to a tipping point where it loses its ability to deliver care to the population. Here we propose a data-driven framework to quantify the regional resilience to such shocks of 1 arXiv:2203.07746v1 [physics.soc-ph] 15 Mar 2022 primary and secondary care in Austria via an agent-based model. For each region and medical specialty we construct detailed patient-sharing networks from administrative data and stress-test these networks by removing increasing numbers of physicians from the system. This allows us to measure regional resilience indicators describing how many physicians can be removed from a certain area before individual patients won't be treated anymore. We find that such tipping points do indeed exist and that regions and medical specialties differ substantially in their resilience. These systemic differences can be related to indicators for individual physicians by quantifying how much their hypothetical removal would stress the system (risk score) or how much of the stress from the removal of other physicians they would be able to absorb (benefit score). Our stress-testing framework could enable health authorities to rapidly identify bottlenecks in access to care as well as to inspect these naturally emerging physician networks and how potential absences would impact them.",

Yet, surprisingly little attention is given to the problem of quantifying and stress-testing the resilience of national healthcare systems, as opposed to, e.g., economic or financial systems where such stress tests are a common risk management practice 16 . In this work we aim to fill this gap by developing a stress-testing framework to quantify the resilience of primary and secondary care by physicians in Austria using agent-based simulations. We adopt the notion of resilience as the ability to manage and regulate the adaptive capacities of a complex adaptive system that can be described via networks 17 . In particular, we consider how regional access to primary and secondary care by physicians depends on the capacities of individual physicians when confronted with shocks that reduce the number of available physicians (be it through retirement, quarantine, or other external shocks). We model the system's response to such a shock in terms of a restructuring of the emergent patient-sharing network and quantify how likely patients are to find new care providers with sufficient capacity within a specific location and time period. The agent-based model is fully calibrated to observational health care access data that covers approx. 100 million visits of 7,630,498 patients at 9,580 physicians of 13 different specialties in Austria.",

We consecutively remove individual physicians of a certain specialty and simulate the ensuing redistribution of patients within the healthcare system as patients of the removed physicians try to find a new health care provider. Patients choose their new physicians with probabilities that are proportional to the number of shared patients between the removed and the potential new physician. Based on their remaining free capacity, the newly chosen physicians will either accept some additional patients or reject them. The rejected patients will continue to look for a new available physician in the next time step, until they reach the maximum number of physicians they 4 are willing to contact (or a maximum distance they are willing to travel). If patients have not been accepted by a given number of physicians, these patients give up on getting an appointment and become 'lost'. We assume the patients' starting locations to be the municipality of their initial physician. The one-by-one removal process of physicians continues until all physicians become unavailable.",

The second set of indicators quantifies properties of individual physicians. For each physician we, therefore, define a risk and a benefit score. The risk score of a physician quantifies how much the removal of that physician affects other physician's capacities (the higher this score, the more likely it is that other physicians will exceed their capacity should the given physician be removed). The benefit score, on the other hand, relates to the free capacity of a physician.",

Some physicians practice more than one medical specialty and/or practice in more than one municipality. Therefore, in the following we always refer to a unique (physician, specialty, municipality) combination, when talking about the number of physicians.

The data contains patients' contacts to physicians from 13 different medical specialties and includes a pseudonymised unique ID for every patient and physician, the date of contact as well as the locations of physicians in form of 5-digit municipality IDs. The first digit of the municipality ID is further used to determine the federal state (9 states in total). The data set contains 9,580 unique combinations of (physician, specialisation, municipality). 1 Permission for scraping the data was obtained from the owners of the platform Patient sharing network To model connections between physicians, we use the patient contact data to construct a patient sharing network. In this network, every node is a physician. The network is described by the adjacency matrix A i,j , where entries a i,j describe the number of shared patients between physicians i and j, i.e. the number of patients that visited both physician i and physician j in a given period of time. The adjacency matrix is therefore symmetrical by definition and the network described by the adjacency matrix is undirected. To construct the adjacency matrix, we start with a patient's visit to physician i and consider all visits of the given patient to other physicians during a period of three months before and after the initial visit to physician i. All thus identified physicians are therefore sharing one patient with i. This process is repeated for all patient visits of physician i. If there is at least one shared patient between i and a given other physician j, there is an edge a i,j between i and j. The edge is weighted by the sum of shared patients. This procedure is repeated for all physicians, resulting in a weighted undirected patient sharing network that is represented by the adjacency matrix A i,j . To reduce spurious relations, the adjacency matrix can be thresholded by requiring a minimum number of shared patients and a maximum geographical distance between physicians i and j. The distance is measured as the direct distance between i's and j's municipalities. The location of municipalities was determined as either the geolocation of the affiliated municipal office or as the geolocation of the area with highest population density in the municipality using a population density map. If the distance between physicians i and j exceeds threshold d, the edge is removed and a i,j = a j,i = 0. Similarly, when the number of shared patients between i and j is smaller than threshold p, the edge is removed.",

As health care demand is further expected to increase in developed countries as the population is ageing and the prevalence of chronic conditions is increasing 11 , there is an increasing need to know how far the available physician supply can be stretched to still deliver the desired quality of care. In this work we proposed novel regional resilience indicators to quantify the point beyond which further decreases in physician densities would begin to severely impair the population's ability to access primary or secondary care. We find strong heterogeneities in these resilience indicators across different medical fields and regions.",

At the end of the procedure, we successfully assigned capacities to 4,288 physicians from the opening hour data set to the patient contact data set, leaving 2,406 physicians (35.9%) in the opening hour data set and 5,292 physicians (55.2%) in the patient contact data set unmatched. We perform a left join of the physicians from the patient contact data and the matched opening hour information, resulting in a total of 9,580 physicians of which 44.8% have opening hour information. Inspection of the distribution of opening hours of matched and unmatched physicians (see SI) shows that there is a slight bias towards unmatched physicians having fewer opening hours. This difference is significant (p < 0.05, two-sided t-test of the opening hour distributions) for general practitioners (h matched = 20.3 \u00b1 4.7 h,h unmatched = 19.7 \u00b1 6.8 h, mean \u00b1 standard deviation), urologists (h matched = 20.5 \u00b1 5.0 h,h unmatched = 18.6 \u00b1 7.4 h) and dermatologists (h matched = 21.4 \u00b1 5.1 h,h unmatched = 19.6 \u00b1 5.0 h).

The strength of the connections can be used to compare how many patients two physicians shared relatively to the other physicians in the network. Detailed values can be retrieved by hovering with the mouse pointer over a connection. To visualise a federal state's resilience, we consider four attributes: free capacity, lost patients, risk level and benefit level. The values of free capacity and lost patients are the average values of all the medical specialties in the federal state. In the glyph shown in Fig. S18, free capacity and lost patients values are respectively represented by the length of the diagonals of a rhombus. Increased length represents a higher value, so that the larger area of the rhombus implies a better resilience performance as physicians are removed from the system. At the same time, the dimensions of the rhombus provide visual cues of the proportion of these two attributes. The values of risk and benefit on the federal state level are the percentage of physicians per state with a risk/benefit score that is higher than the nationwide average risk/benefit score. The risk and benefit attributes are respectively represented by a colour-coded filled arc area in a semicircle. Green thereby means a low value, whereas red indicates a high value.
