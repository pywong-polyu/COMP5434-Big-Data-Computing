Well balanced diet, rich in fruits and vegetables, that are source of vitamins and other nutrients may reduce the risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, diabetes and osteoporosis (1, 2) . In turn, micronutrient deficiency can have wide-range negative health impacts (3) . The WHO states, that the best way of preventing micronutrient malnutrition is to ensure consumption of a balanced diet that is adequate in every nutrient (4). To help people eat better, healthy eating guidelines have been developed in many countries around the world (5) . They provide evidence-based statements on food choices to meet nutritional requirements and reduce the risk of prevailing chronic disease (6) . However, recommendations for taking food supplements (foodstuff which are concentrated sources of nutrients i.e., minerals and vitamins or other substances with a nutritional or physiological effect) have also been developed for certain population groups, where scientific evidence indicates a benefit of such supplementation. For example, it is commonly recommended to supplement diet with vitamin D in all population groups of Central Europe countries, including Poland (7, 8) . Other example are pregnant women who have increased requirements for certain nutrients, like folic acid, supplementation of which is recommended in order to reduce the risk of neural tube defects in infants (9) . An elderly people may also need supplementation, as absorption of some nutrients becomes less efficient with aging, but the need for the supplementation should be confirmed by a doctor (10, 11) . For vegans, vitamin B 12 must be obtained from regular use of vitamin B 12 -fortified foods, otherwise a daily vitamin B 12 supplement is needed (12) .",

            "text": "However, the constantly expanding market of supplements and their non-prescription status make them generally available for all population groups (13) . Young people who consume an unbalance diet, instead of improving eating habits, use food supplements with the belief that it will reduce the risk of serious health complications (14, 15) . Adult food supplement users perceive supplements as an easy and safe way to stay healthy (16, 17) . Although the issues related to the composition and labeling of food supplements have been legally regulated at the EU level (18) , there are still elements for which no legislative solutions have been developed. In Poland, the provisions of Directive 2002/46/EC are implemented by the Food and Nutrition Safety Act (19) and the Regulation of the Minister of Health on the composition and labeling of food supplements (20) . The law defines, inter alia, what vitamins and minerals and what their chemical forms may be used in the food supplements. However, there are still no maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in supplements set at the EU level. The law only says what criteria should be taken into account when setting such levels. These are: upper safe levels of vitamins and minerals established by scientific risk assessment based on generally accepted scientific data, taking into account, as appropriate, the varying degrees of sensitivity of different consumer groups, the intake of vitamins and minerals from other dietary sources and the reference intakes of vitamins and minerals for the population (18, 20) . The lack of regulations in the above scope makes it possible to use high doses of vitamins and minerals in food supplements, and unjustified consumption of vitamin and mineral products may lead to exceeding the safe levels of these nutrients (21, 22) . In that context the food supplement consumption in the adult population in Poland was assessed. Firstly it was estimated what percentage of Polish adults consumed food supplements. Then, the detailed examination only among people who reported the consumption of these products was made. In order to check if there was a risk of excessive intake of vitamins and minerals only from food supplements the composition of food supplements used by the subjects as well as the amounts of vitamins and minerals they consumed within these products were analyzed. These amounts have been compared to the Dietary Reference Values and Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (UL) in order to assess whether food supplements were a significant and safe source of these nutrients. The result on intake of vitamins and minerals from all dietary sources including base diet will be analyzed and published separately.",
