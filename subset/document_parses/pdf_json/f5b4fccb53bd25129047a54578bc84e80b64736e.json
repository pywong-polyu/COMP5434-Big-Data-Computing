We used a certified dataset reporting information about 456 Italian consumers during the lockdown in the first wave of the pandemic emergency (April 2020). The survey collected data about changes in food purchases, respondents' mood during the lockdown, conspiracist beliefs, exposure to the virus, and planned food purchasing behavior after the lockdown. We used the data to construct measures of the psychological pressure exerted by the COVID-19 emergency on consumers. We use an endogenous selection regression model to assess the impact of psychological pressure on the decision of changing food purchased. The analysis identified two opposite approaches to change in food purchasing decisions: impulsive approach and reflective approach. The former is associated with a higher probability of changing food purchase but a lower probability to keep the changes in the long run than the latter. Our results suggest that COVID-19 psychological pressure was associated with impulsive approach to buy food. Consequently, food-purchasing behavior is expected to revert to pre-COVID 19 habits when the emergency is over.",

Our main goal is to assess whether the changes in consumer behavior during the lockdown will vanish with the COVID-19 emergency or we can expect that at least some effects will last over time. The main contribution of the paper is the investigation of association between the psychological impact of the lockdown and the expected duration of the change in consumption patterns. Our analysis considers psychological factor linked to the impact of the lockdownsuch as the attitude toward the disease and fear of being exposed to the risk of contracting the virusand assesses the association with current (i.e., during the lockdown) and planned (i.e., after the emergency will be over) purchasing decisions. This approach allows us to test the hypothesis that differences in the intensity of the experience are associated with different reaction in terms of food purchases over time.",

Specifically, some authors focused their studies on consumers' dietary habits. For example, Romeo-Arroyo et al. (2020) , through a Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA), explored food related behavior of the Spanish population during the COVID-19 confinement period. Their findings indicate the existence of three consumer segments (low-cooking engagement, health-concerned, and health-disregarded) with different food related habits (i.e. the health-disregarded group of consumers was characterized by having unhealthier attitudes, maybe related to the lower emotional mood of respondents belonging to this cluster). In Poland, Sidor & Rzymski (2020) found that during the pandemic-related confinement, a significant percentage of individuals could experience modification of dietary habits, manifested by eating and snacking more. In the Italian context, Di Renzo et al. (2020) investigated the relationship between eating habits, mental and emotional mood during the COVID-19 confinement period, founding that a high percentage of respondents experienced a depressed mood, anxious feelings, hypochondria, and insomnia. Moreover, almost half of the interviewed consumed comfort food and were inclined to increase food intake to feel better, with age inversely related to dietary control. Similar results are found by Ammar et al. (2020) and Scarmozzino and Visioli (2020) . Furthermore, focusing on a sample of adolescents from different countries (Spain, Italy, Brazil, Colombia and Chile) aged between 10 to 19 years, Ruiz-Roso et al. (2020) discovered that COVID-19 pandemic has modified their dietary trends, increasing their sweet food consumption probably due to the boredom and stress produced by the confinement. On the other hand, they also found that families had more time to cook and improve eating habits, even though this did not increase the overall adolescents' diet quality.",

For instance, Long and Huy Khoi (2020) and Khan (2020) adopted the Theory of Planned Behavior model (TPB) in combination with the theory of consumer risk perception to understand the factors that affect the hoarding food behavior of Vietnamese and Bangladeshi consumers during COVID-19 pandemic. The results from these studies indicate that the risk perception of the COVID-19 pandemic has positively affected consumer attitudes towards the intention to hoard the food. Similarly, Li et al. (2020) adopted the TPB in order to provide early empirical insights into changes in consumer food shopping in China. Their findings highlighted the existence of considerable levels of switching behaviors among consumers, with local small independent retailers characterized by the highest levels of resilience in terms of customer retention. In Canada, Cranfield (2020) provided an early assessment of the factors related to COVID-19 that might affect consumer demand for food. These factors include the structure of preferences in the context of a pandemic, income and time constraints, and price effects. Similarly, focusing on New Zealand as a case study, Martin-Neuninger and Ruby (2020) evaluated the likely consequences of the lockdown on consumer grocery purchasing habits, reporting that under the new shopping conditions, consumers, are more likely to raise their overall supermarket spend due to impulse buying and time pressure, decreasing spending in other areas. Moreover, authors suggested that, given the restriction to the availability of some food products, consumers might buy unfamiliar brands, changing their habits. Finally, Laato et al. (2020) examined how online information sources affect Finnish consumers behavioral change during the COVID-19 pandemic adapting the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework by adding unusual purchasing and voluntary self-isolation variables. Results showed the existence of a strong link between self-intention to self-isolate and intention to make unusual purchases. Furthermore, results revealed that the exposure to online information sources increased the health anxiety, and consequently, the intention to make unusual purchases and engaging in voluntarily isolation.",

It affects consumers' shopping opportunities (i.e., it prevents consumers from shopping from the usual outlets because of movement limitation), as suggested by Cranfield (2020) , Martin-Neuningen and Ruby (2020). Also, it affects consumers' psychological conditions because of the lockdown stress, as in Di Renzo et al. (2020) and Ruiz-Roso et al. (2020) . The constraints on the outlet choice and the psychological pressure might lead consumers to change their consumptions decisions (compared to the counterfactual) resulting in the purchasing of \"new\" food (as suggested by Latoo et al., 2020) . 1 After the COVID-19 emergency, the consumers must decide whether to keep the new food in the shopping basket or not. In the post-lockdown period, the movement limitations are removed so that there are no constraints on the outlet choice anymore. As a consequence, the decision to keep the innovation depends on the consumption experience (i.e., whether the consumer liked it or not) and on possible long-term psychological effects of the pandemic (i.e., whether the emergency led to a permanent change in the consumer's set of preferences). A positive statistical association between the decision of keeping the new product and 1 By \"new food\" we mean a food product that the consumer never bought before. This definition allows us to identify definite changes in purchasing behavior and to ask an unambiguous question to consumers. We acknowledge that change in consumption decision might concern food that was already known to the consumers (for example, eating more chocolate), however collecting information regarding such changes in habits required extensive data collection that was beyond the available resources. the variables describing the psychological pressure during the lockdown is considered as an empirical evidence supporting the existence of a longterm psychological effect. In this case, we can affirm that the COVID 19 lockdown has a long-term effect on consumption.",

The degree of conspiracist attitude is considered as a proxy for the respondent propensity to believing in news provided by unofficial sources. Such beliefs are expected to influence the consumer's mood during the lockdown and, ultimately, food consumption. For example, during the lockdown phase a steam of news (both true and fake) ran on social networks regarding the virtuous behaviors (including diet) capable of making people more resistant to COVID 19. 6 We created a specific scale to measure the conspiracist attitudes towards Covid-19 that have been inspired by the Conspiracy Mentality Questionnaire (CMQ -Bruder et al., 2013) and the Generic Conspiracist Beliefs scale (GCB -Brotherton et al., 2013) . While these two scales are general measures of personal conspiracist tendency, our scale focuses specifically on the COVID-19 crisis and was composed by eight items presenting different potential origin of the COVID-19 virus and the respondents were asked to state how likely they believe that the statements were true. This scale is called Conspiracist Attitudes towards COVID-19 (CA-COV) and it is presented in Table A1 in the appendix.

In fact, if we consider the three most endorsed positive and negative statements of the SPANE scale, consumers stated that they felt \"good\", \"pleasant\" and \"positive\" often or very often during the lockdown in the 51.75, 38.60 and 36.18 per cent of the case respectively, while they felt \"negative, \"sad\" and \"angry\" often or very often in the 35.31, 34.21 and 29,17 per cent of the case respectively.
