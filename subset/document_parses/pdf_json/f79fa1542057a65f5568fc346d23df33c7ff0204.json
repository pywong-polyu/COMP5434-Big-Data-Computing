            "text": "In this paper we focus on the implied volatility surface estimation (the implied volatility function which evolves in time over some fixed observational period) and we advocate and combine various ideas to construct the overall model: sparse estimation with LASSO regularization and changepoints, quantile regression with panel data structure, or interpolated implied volatility values with a constant maturity. From the theoretical point of view, the presented method is motivated by the concept of a regularized changepoint detection proposed in [7] and further elaborated for the conditional quantile estimation in [4, 5] . A similar idea of the sparse estimation was also recently presented in [18] to estimate the option price function using a standard squared loss objective function while the conditional quantile estimation approach was proposed in [12] . The quantile estimation is, in general, considered to be robust and it also offers a more complex insight into the underlying data as it can estimate any arbitrary conditional quantile rather than just the conditional mean. The robustness property is also useful as the final model is not too sensitive with respect to various market anomalies (such as bid-ask spreads, discrete ticks in price, non-synchronous trading, etc.). The panel data structure allows for a time dependent modeling and changepoints introduce some additional flexibility which is convenient for reflecting some occasional sudden changes in the market (caused by various financial, economical, political, or natural causes). Finally, the natural evolution of the implied volatility over time, from the issuing date of the option until its maturity, shows some increase in convexity of the implied volatility smile. In order to avoid this issue and to focus on the changes that are due to some exogenous effects the implied volatility of an artificial option with a constant maturity of 30 days is introduced. Such implied volatility is computed by interpolating the implied volatility of options at consecutive maturities. The artificial options with the constant maturity are later used to estimated the corresponding implied volatility surface.",

The linear constraints enforce the convexity of the estimated implied volatility surface-the convexity (i.e., the volatility smile) with respect to the strikes simultaneously for every day from the analyzed period. The volatility smiles for consecutive days are assumed to be mostly the same with only a few exceptions where the implied volatility function from the time t changes at the time t + 1 to adapt for some existing underlying changes on the market. The estimated implied volatility panels are presented in Fig. 3 . It is clear that the estimated implied volatility functions are, indeed, all convex for any time point t \u2208 {1, . . . , 37}. The overall surface is quite stable but there are also some obvious changes in the estimated volatility surface: some of them occur over time and others are present within the convexity of the volatility smile for some fixed trading days. From the practical point of view, there are two different explanations for these changes: the changes occurring over time are most likely caused by some exogenous effects (such as the recent COVID-19 outbreaks or the President Trump tweets on additional 10 % tariff to be placed on Chinese imports) while the changes in the volatility smile (increasing convexity when approaching the expiry dates) are still due to some natural dynamics of the market (i.e., high spikes for high strikes in Fig. 3) . From the theoretical point of view, these two cases can not be distinguished automatically therefore, we used the artificial options with the constant maturity of 30 days in order to suppress the changes caused by the natural dynamics of the market and, on the other hand, to highlight and detect the changes caused by the external causes. The natural market dynamics is still present in the estimated surface in term of a few high spikes, however, the rest of the surface can be effectively used to analyze the market with respect to external causes effecting the market.",

From Fig. 3 it is obvious that a sudden change (a spike or a wave respectively) occurring on the 20th trading day is only observed for high strikes (roughly the strike values above 38 Euro) while no such behavior is observed for lower strikes. Such panel specific tests are, however, all significant as the overall variability of the observed implied volatility values is relatively high and, more importantly, the raw volatility values do not reflect the arbitrage free market scenario which is implicitly accounted for in our model. In addtion, the multiple testing problem should be considered taken care of properly. Therefore, more precise and more appropriate conclusions can be indeed drawn from the model presented in Fig. 3 ",

The sparsity principle and the LASSO fused-type penalty are used to firstly inflate the overall flexibility of the model but, later, the estimate is regularized in order to obtain the final model which fully complies with the financial theory developed for the arbitrage-free market scenarios. The model also implicitly incorporates a prior knowledge that the implied volatility function should not change too roughly and it should be, more or less, stable over time.",

Two situations are considered: the first day of the observational period on the left panel, and t = 20 (volatility peak) on the right panel. The estimation is considered without any linear restrictions (dashed blue lines) and with the linear constraints-which enforce the volatility smile (solid red lines) and, thus, arbitrage-free validity3.2 Time Dependent Implied Volatility SurfaceTheimplied volatility values are now represented as a sample {(Y ti , x it ); t = 1, . . . , T ; i = 1, . . . , n}, where Y it stands for the implied volatility at some specific time t \u2208 {1, . . . , T } and the given strike x it \u2208 D, for i \u2208 {1, . . . , n}. For simplicity, the quoted strikes are common over time, therefore, we have that x it \u2261 x i , for i = 1, . . . , n. For each quoted strike x i \u2208 D there is a strike specific panel of the implied volatilities observed over time t \u2208 {1, . . . , T }. The value of T \u2208 N represents, for instance, the number of trading days available in the data.
