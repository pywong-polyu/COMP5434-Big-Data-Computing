The stressors related to the pandemic are evaluated as either transitory or permanent shocks to both the practice of financial planning and client financial concerns. Based on qualitative responses from practicing financial planners, changes in practice and client concerns as a result of the pandemic are outlined. At the global level, respondents shared that the practice of financial planning has accelerated its adoption of communication technology while clients are experiencing unprecedented levels of stress related to changes in health, the economy, and the political landscape in the United States. Insights and observations from the sample of practicing financial planners are used to inform recommendations for practice.

Whether it is a financial shock like the Global Financial Crisis (i.e., Great Recession), the COVID-19 pandemic, or client-specific household shocks such as a divorce or health crisis, financial planners play a vital role in helping families adjust to a new normal or return to the original course of action. Household financial shocks are not unusual, but client responses vary. So too, does the consequence of the financial shock and whether it spirals into a \"destabilizing financial shock,\" described as diminished financial well-being (Pew Charitable Trust, 2015, p. 3) . Recent financial planning research demonstrates that perceived environmental threats to a person's well-being triggers physiological stress which remains beyond the actual event and diminishes a variety family outcomes (Grable, 2013; Grable & Britt, 2012; Zepp, 2019) . This is consistent with scholarship on stress and its link to the health and well-being of individuals and families (for reviews see Masarik & Conger, 2017; Mistry, Lowe, Benner, & Chien, 2008; O'Connor, Thayer, & Vedhara, 2021; Thoits, 1995) .",

Depending on the client, once a financial shock hits, financial planners can be expected to provide reassurance to clients about the plan along with emotional and social support. The demands precipitated by clients in the event of a financial shock depend on the extent to which the client trusts their financial planner, has confidence in the plan, their perception of the financial threat, and their financial stress response. A previous study of client financial stress found that clients do a poor job of accurately appraising their own subjective or real financial stress level, with almost half of the clients demonstrating \"stress denial\" (Grable & Britt, 2012, p. 43) . A client's perception of their financial challenges and associated financial stress is important since stress has been found to be associated with initially seeking help from a financial professional as well as engaging in subsequent financial planning behavior that may alter their financial situation (Grable, 2013; Grable & Britt, 2012; Grable, Heo, & Rabbani, 2015; Grable & Joo, 2001) .",

If this shock is a \"permanent\" disruption then the impact of COVID-19 will be everlasting and will not dissipate out of the system as it would if it were a \"transitory\" shock. In this article, we wrestle with the question of whether the COVID-19 shock on household finances, the business of financial planning, and clients of financial planners is permanent versus transitory. Essentially, we are asking, has the nature of the work, and the needs of clients, been forever changed by the COVID-19 pandemic? Empirically, this is an impossible question to answer as this article is being written during the early days of vaccine administration in the United States. In time, a capable time-series economist or social scientist will prove the existence of a permanent or transitory impact. For now, we offer insights of practicing financial planners on changes in practice and client needs.",

It is clear that the use of technology in delivering financial planning services is the most significant change in the practice of providing financial advice. This change is viewed by some as an acceleration of a process already in motion, and a temporary fix by financial planners wanting to return to a relationship (face-to-face, nonvirtual) model of service delivery. For clients and their finances, the issues are more diverse, with some clients changing their plans forever and others making small adjustments that may be long forgotten in the post-pandemic years.",

On the balance, the Pew study concludes that the effects of shocks are long-lasting for many households. For about a quarter of the sample, the impact of a simple event, such as an unexpected auto repair, was still present 6 months after the event. The length of the impact of the shock was longest for those with the fewest resources. For higher resource households, the speed of recovery was observed to be much faster. Financial shocks were shown to be \"destabilizing,\" meaning households struggled to make ends meet (Pew Charitable Trust, 2015, p. 6). The size of the expense of the financial shock was the key destabilizing feature.",

The median household absorbed income equal to about a half a month's income, with lowerincome households forfeiting a month's worth of income compared to higher income households who reportedly spent three times that amount on their most expensive shock, with a median shock cost of $3,000. Regardless, financial shocks in the Pew study were shown to have long-lasting effects, regardless of household income level. This was particularly true in relation to larger \"destabilizing\" shocks. A key takeaway from the study is that a financial shock undermines feelings of financial security in households, with feelings of insecurity amplified among younger households, households of color, and households with annual incomes less than $50,000 (Pew Charitable Trusts, 2015).",

Through the end of July 2020, the PEUC program supplemented state weekly unemployment benefits by an additional $600. Four in 10 adults indicated that their unemployment benefits were higher than what they earned before being laid off or losing their job, with 36% indicating the benefits were lower (Federal Reserve Board, 2020). The PEUC program also extended benefits to classes of employees not typically eligible, such as gig economy workers, self-employed workers, independent contractors, and other typically noneligible workers.

Among high income households, spending only increased modestly compared to low-income households, which saw a spike after receiving a payment. One study found household liquidity was the strongest predictor of households spending their stimulus payment (Baker, Farrokhnia, Meyer, Pagel, & Yannelis, 2020) . Among low-income households of color (e.g., Latinx or Black), the actual receipt of stimulus payments was 8% lower when compared to White households (Cantor & Landry, 2020) .",

Going into the COVID-19 crisis, one study found almost 40% of households lacked enough liquid savings to maintain their household expenses for 3 months (Cantor & Sims, 2020) . Another study found 77% of lower-income, 52% of middle-income, and 25% of upper-income households did not have liquid savings to cover 3 months of living expenses in the absence of income (Parker, Horowitz, & Brown, 2020) . Since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, one-third of American households have dipped into their savings or retirement accounts to pay household expenses (Parker, Minkin, & Bennett, 2020) . In another study, just over half of US households needed to tap into retirement savings to meet the shortfall brought on by income loss and lack of emergency savings (Cantor & Sims, 2020) .",

(CFP Board) has been on the forefront of documenting how the COVID-19 pandemic has and continues to impact the practice of financial planners. Working in collaboration with Iowa State University, 90 financial planners were surveyed in November 2020 about changes in their practice, adjustments made by their clients, and any other observations on financial planning and COVID-19. Approximately 30% of those surveyed provided meaningful responses. These financial planners were considered ideal informants as they were engaged dually in the practice of financial planning and in a CFP Board-sponsored program that provides training in teaching financial planning courses at the college level. The purpose of the survey was to gather insights and perspectives about how the COVID-19 pandemic impacted their financial planning practice and the service needs of their clients. 1 Using Qualtrics, three core questions were asked to allow for open-ended input on changes in practice, changes in client expectations and concerns, and any other thoughts related to COVID-19 and financial planning. Two additional questions were used to assess participant years in practice and a general description of each participant's financial planning practice.",

In some cases, it was the perceived willingness of clients, and effectiveness of virtual communication, that will push planners back to face-to-face engagements.",

            "text": "In a similar investigation with implications for the practice, Kiesnoski and Mercado (2020) shared observations from financial planners. For one firm, 90% of client contacts moved to GoToMeeting with the onset of the pandemic. Prior to March 2020, an estimated 10% of the firm's 600 clients were contacted through a virtual meeting platform. While the prevalence of remote meetings is expected to remain high, firm leaders expect about a 50/50 split between virtual and face-to-face meetings after full implementation of a COVID-19 vaccine. Again, similar to the financial planners in the CFP Board-Iowa State University study, the nature of financial planning meetings has likely changed. Meetings are shorter, more focused, and more frequent. If the benefits for both financial planners and clients of a virtual-based communication strategy can be found and highlighted, then the practice of financial planning is likely changed forever. The success with which firms find these benefits will likely be the determining factor in returning to \"normal\" or moving to the \"new-normal.\"",

            "text": "Regarding their clients, financial planners in this study consistently shared that clients have been significantly stressed throughout the period defined by the pandemic. While health concerns appear to be the major cause of the stress for some families, concerns over the economy and political division have compounded stress levels, likely impacting client ability to engage productively in financial decisions. Some planners noted the need to serve more as counselor than planner, helping clients focus on what matters more than money. Revisiting basic financial goals after job loss or dedication to spending more time with family and friends, was noted by some planners as a positive outcome of a stressful period. In helping families revisit their foundational financial goals, planners are challenged to recommit to the comprehensive nature of the behavioral and human based practice of financial planning. Through their comments, it appears as if financial planners are ready and willing to continue investing in and using their skills as expert communicators, counselors, and life coaches. Benz (2020) outlined the practical financial planning implications of COVID-19 for clients. Not surprisingly, her recommendations were founded on the importance of an emergency fund and liquid asset holdings to move through the crisis. Creative solutions such as using Health Savings Accounts to simultaneously save for an emergency and take advantage of tax deferral were discussed. Benz also shared strategies for transitioning to an earlier than expected retirement and dealing with low yields in traditional lending investments held by retirees. In considering these more traditional responses to the shock of COVID-19, financial planners can and will be asked to go farther.",

            "text": "Financial planners can expect to take on an integrated counselor and planner role-perhaps moving away from a purely technical or transactional focus. In the role of a counselor, financial planners will likely be tasked with asking clients to stretch to implement secondary or alternate plans. This is where a financial planner asks their client to move from the transitory to the permanent impact of the COVID-19 shock. A career change or early retirement is such an example of not simply hoping that existing liquid resources are adequate to get past the crisis, but actually changing the fundamentals of the plan itself. Some of these ever-lasting changes may be reimagining fixed expenses as variable expenses, changing education goals for children, or adjusting expectations for a future level of living. As a final way of thinking about permanent and transitory shocks in financial planning, the transitory nature of shocks can be handled within the plan, encouraging clients that this is a series of changes that we will get them through the crisis. A permanent shock is one that literally changes the financial goals for the client, resulting in a whole new plan.",

The COVID-19 pandemic has fully tested this task orientation and the ability of financial planners to rise to the challenge of a global health and financial shock. Whether the world's economies will ever return to normal, or if there will be a permanent adjustment to a new normal, is something to be determined over the course of the next few years. What is known for certain is that the COVID-19 pandemic has introduced a new type of \"destabilizing financial shock\" into the lexicon of financial planning. With certainty we can say that no practicing financial planner will ever forget the period of practice defined by the pandemic. Stress at the macro, micro, and human level is something that financial planners will need to deal with in their ongoing work with clients, as they too will never forget COVID-19. The aftermath of the pandemic may mean that financial planners will be called upon to not only provide financial advice and counsel through the pandemic period, but also engage when clients face challenges and opportunities that hearken back to individual, family, and household stressors connected to such a remarkable period in history.",
