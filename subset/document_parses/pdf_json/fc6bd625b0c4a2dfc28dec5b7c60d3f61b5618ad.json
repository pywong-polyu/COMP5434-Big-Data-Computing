            "text": "The HIV epidemic has dramatically changed over the past 30 years; there are now fewer newly infected people (especially children), fewer AIDS-related deaths, and more people with HIV (PWH) receiving treatment. However, the HIV epidemic is far from over. Despite the tremendous advances in anti-retroviral therapies (ART) and the implementation of ART regimens, HIV incidence (number of new infections over a defined period of time) and prevalence (the burden of HIV infection) in certain regions of the world and socio-economic groups are still on the rise. HIV continues to disproportionally affect highly marginalized populations that constitute higher-risk and stigmatized groups, underserved and/or neglected populations. In addition, it is not uncommon for PWH to suffer enhanced debilitating conditions resulting from the synergistic interactions of both communicable diseases (CDs) and non-communicable diseases (NCDs). While research utilizing only a comorbidities framework has advanced our understanding of the biological settings of the co-occurring conditions from a molecular and mechanistic view, harmful interactions between comorbidities are often overlooked, particularly under adverse socio-economical and behavioral circumstances, likely prompting disease clustering in PWH. Synergistic epidemics (syndemics) research aims to capture these understudied interactions: the mainly non-biological aspects that are central to interpret disease clustering in the comorbidities/multi-morbidities only framework. Connecting population-level clustering of social and health problems through syndemic interventions has proved to be a critical knowledge gap that will need to be addressed in order to improve prevention and care strategies and bring us a step closer to ending the HIV epidemic.",

HIV-associated cardiomyopathy and pulmonary hypertension are highly prevalent within PWH in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) [1] . Additionally, sleep disturbances are prevalent in PWH along with the increased risk for other comorbid disorders such as cardiovascular disease (CVD), hypertension (HTN), stroke, and diabetes which lead to the syndemic emergence of diseases in PWH in the United States and in LMICs [2, 3] .",

While ART improves life expectancy significantly and decreases susceptibility to HIV-related infections, it also leads to an increase in the incidence of age-related NCD such as chronic cardiovascular, pulmonary, and hematological conditions [7, 8] . ART is known to increase the risk of heart failure and other cardiopulmonary conditions [9] [10] [11] . In sub-Saharan Africa~23.5 million people live with HIV and the majority are on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) [12] [13] [14] . As people live longer, the prevalence of HIV infection in LMICs and its co-occurrence with other CD and NCD are increasing compared to high-income countries (HICs). Current models predict that while HIV/AIDS will not be among the top 10 leading causes of death for high-income countries, it will remain in the top five for LMICs, and will cluster with other NCDs [14] . Countries within Central and South America and the Caribbean, Central and sub-Saharan Africa, and Southeast Asia regions have the potential to be the most negatively affected by the co-occurrence of syndromes, revealing a major health disparity and the need to address the challenges in these regions, as well as the urgency to gain a deeper understanding of the root causes of disease clustering in PWH and ways to mitigate them effectively.",

Research suggests that these unhealthy behaviors, specifically smoking and drinking, increase the risk of hypertension and coronary heart disease in this already vulnerable population [20, 21] . The role of substance abuse (e.g., opioids) in the clustering of cardiovascular, lung, blood, and sleep disorders/diseases in PWH is also not clearly understood. Furthermore, stigma, discrimination, and violence have inhibited many from seeking or receiving proper healthcare.",

According to CDC, 23% of new HIV diagnoses in the South are in suburban and rural areas, and in the Midwest, 21% are suburban or rural-higher proportions than in the North and West. As these communities have unique healthcare needs, 'rural residence' is a risk factor for lower rates of HIV testing, later HIV diagnosis, later adoption of advances in ART and, consequently, increased HIV-related mortality. In addition, rural residents with HIV infection often face challenges such as stigma, social isolation, long distances to care, limited transportation, and lack of access to providers with HIV expertise [30] . A better understanding of all the factors contributing to the increasing numbers of comorbidities in these regions is urgently needed, and research implementing syndemics frameworks will be fundamental to address this urgency.",

Of the approximately 37.9 million people living with HIV, more than one-third are also infected with TB. In fact, TB is the leading killer of people with HIV, accounting for 1 in 3 AIDS-related deaths [6] . In HIV-infected individuals, TB often occurs outside the lungs, evading traditional diagnostic tests and making people unaware that they have TB. Poorly ventilated facilities such as hospitals, homeless shelters, prisons, and clinics can promote the spread of TB to vulnerable HIV-positive individuals, further fueling the syndemic [31] . This can be especially problematic as anti-TB drugs can directly interfere with antiretroviral therapy [32] . Therefore, understanding the intersection and syndemic interaction between TB and HIV is necessary to provide adequate control of this deadly combination [33, 34] . On top of the HIV/TB health challenge, the use of tobacco, while not a communicable disease, is yet another global epidemic that collectively with HIV/TB amplifies the health impacts of the individual factors. The three epidemics (HIV, TB and tobacco use) are often approached individually in low-income countries. These syndemics share common social determinants of health (poverty, low-education, high population density, cultural patterns), and health systems could benefit from holistic frameworks to integrate all factors to improve disease outcome and clinical practice.",

However, coupled with the fact that these additional years of life require treatment for survival and that PWH are more susceptible to opportunistic infections as well as a multitude of other chronic diseases, a diagnosis of HIV now presents as a critical economic burden. Currently, the average annual cost of treating HIV/AIDS alone is approximately USD 20,000 among all levels of CD4 count [35] . A male living in Kenya diagnosed at age 20 could expect to pay a lifetime total of almost USD 1 million. It is important to consider that this value ignores the indirect costs associated with treating HIV/AIDS, such as transportation, the time and effort required of family members to assist in managing the infection, as well as the larger, contextual burden of productivity loss which has great potential to negatively affect economic stability. In Africa, economic growth can be reduced by up to 4% each year as a result of HIV/AIDS-related productivity loss [36] .",
