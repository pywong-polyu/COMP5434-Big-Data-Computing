Patients with pulmonary TB are the source of transmission. Approximately 23% of the world's population is believed to be latently infected with TB bacteria, and 5-15% of them will progress at any point in time to develop the disease. There was a global diagnostic gap of 2.9 million between notifications of new cases and the estimated number of incident cases, and Indonesia carries the third-highest of this gap. Therefore, screening TB among the community is of great importance to prevent further transmission and infection. The electronic nose for screening TB (eNose-TB) project is initiated in Yogyakarta, Indonesia, to screen TB by breath test with an electronic-nose that is easy-to-use, point-of-care, does not expose patients to radiation, and can be produced at low cost.",

The screening is prioritized for people who have close contacts with TB (who live in the same household or frequent contact with the sputum smear-positive TB patients), and afterward for populations at risk of TB (people with HIV, diabetes, residents of the area with high TB transmission, i.e., slum areas) [3] . Screening with clinical symptoms has a sensitivity of 70% while screening with chest radiography has a sensitivity of 87% (3) . However, chest radiography exposes patients to radiation and is not practical to use in remote areas. Due to TB's significant clinical and economic impact, it is of great importance to develop screening tools that are accurate, point-ofcare, easy to use, and produced at a low cost, thus can be widely used in lower-middle-income countries such as Indonesia.",

An eNose is an easy-to-use tool based on an array of sensors that can learn and diagnose a disease from the pattern of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that are produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis [6] [7] [8] or by the host metabolism due to TB, which are different from standard conditions [9] . The sensor array in the electronic nose comprises non-specific sensors exposed to a variety of odor-sensitive biological materials, such as breath, urine, or feces. An odor stimulus produces a specific fingerprint from the sensor array. Patterns or fingerprints from known odors are used to build a database and train a pattern recognition system; thus, unknown odors can subsequently be classified. Generally, eNose instruments consist of hardware components to collect and transport odors to the sensor array and electronic circuitry to digitize and store the sensor's responses for signal processing [10] . An eNose is practical to carry, easy to use, and without radiation exposure, making it suitable as a screening tool.",

The data were cleaned by windowing the data during the sampling phase with five windows, and a feature extraction method was performed in each window, namely the maximum value, the median value, and the standard deviation value. Afterward, a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) was used in training procedures as a validation method. LOOCV was used in the hyper-parameters tuning process of Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) for a feature selection method. Logistic regression was used as an estimator in the RFE method.",

There are 16 sensors used, with the characteristics of global selectivity. Based on the datasheet and our tests' results, each sensor responds to at least 5 different gases, thus the detection range is at least 80 different VOC groups. With that coverage, the sensor array will form a relatively consistent pattern for each group of breath. Fig 6 is a typical voltage response of 16 sensors in eNose-TB device to time. The sensor response begins with the baseline at the same level for 10 seconds, when the surrounding air is introduced into the gas sensor room. After that, the electronic valve will control that the breath sample is inserted into the gas sensor chamber for 120 s. The sensing process occurs after the 10th seconds to the 130th seconds, so the total sampling time is 120 seconds. When the sensing process is complete, the sensor room is cleaned with the ambient air until it returns to the original baseline level. To distinguish the breath response pattern between the negative and positive TB subjects, each sensor's response during the sensing process is divided into 5 windows with an interval of 24 seconds each.",

In each variable (such as age, body mass index), one stratum's ROC-curve indicating the breath test's sensitivity and specificity is compared with another stratum's ROC-curve. An association between the breath test's variable and sensitivity-specificity is indicated by a significant difference of an AUC between strata (p < 0.05). In the second phase (screening phase), the performance of screening with a breath test will be compared with screening with clinical symptoms or CXR examination by calculating positive and negative agreements between the breath test and clinical symptoms or CXR examination. The time and cost of a screening algorithm with eNose-TB to obtain additional detection of one TB case will be calculated as the mean of time needed and mean of cost spent from the beginning of screening with the eNose-TB until the detection of the case. Statistical analysis is performed using STATA/SE 15 (License: Universitas Gadjah Mada).",
