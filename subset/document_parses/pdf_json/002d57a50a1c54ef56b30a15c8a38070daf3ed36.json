To date, there are more than twelve million people infected, and more than half a million deaths worldwide. 2020 has already become a \"historic\" year when we need to change our relationship with nature and our society's priorities. In addition to the poor historical conditions of basic sanitation and housing and the concentration of income in Brazil, the virus found some critical ally, which the present chapter will focus. Even having a public and universal Unified Health System (UHS), Brazil, unfortunately, became an international highlight in the number of contaminated and killed, becoming a true negative reference in the fight against the pandemic. In Rio de Janeiro, we endeavored to draw a panel of the COVID-19 pandemic impact on its territory. From its entry via global contacts in the more affluent areas, the \"virus of globalization\" gradually reached the suburban areas and, finally, the metropolitan peripheries which are more impoverished and susceptible to problems. In this sense, the Fluminense Lowland, formed by thirteen cities and where the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro (UFRRJ) is located, has become a favorable space for contamination and dispersion of the pandemic, promoting a dynamic of accelerated expansion and aggressive lethality. Visiting the pandemic's impacts on the metropolitan peripheries is the great research challenge for all researchers committed to the community and social justice.",

From its entry via global contacts in the more affluent areas (worthy to say it a virus of globalization), it gradually reached the suburban areas and, finally, the metropolitan peripheries where the population is more impoverished and susceptible to problems. In this sense, the Baixada Fluminense, formed by thirteen cities and where the Federal Rural University is located, has become a favorable space for contamination and dispersion of the pandemic, promoting a dynamic of accelerated expansion and aggressive lethality. Visiting the pandemic's impacts on the metropolitan peripheries is a significant research challenge for all researchers committed to the community and social justice. Figures 3.7 , 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 will help the readers witnessing the spatial distribution of the evolution of the number of cases, the number of deaths, and the case fatality ratio in the Rio de Janeiro State. In March (Fig. 3.7) just twentyfour cases occurred in the Rio de Janeiro capital and Niter\u00f3i city, located in the east metropolitan region. In the following months (Figs. 3.8, 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13) a concentration in the metropolitan area is observed in the number of confirmed cases, deaths, and case fatality ratio. The illness concentration is high in the metropolitan area and spreads, little by little, to other cities in the Rio de Janeiro State.",

Besides, this area is also a large contingent of segregated, impoverished spaces, with insufficient basic sanitation and high poverty rates. Baixada Fluminense also has internal differences, especially between the historic Baixada, with denser urbanization, and the portion of the metropolitan west end formed by the Serop\u00e9dica, Itagua\u00ed, Paracambi, Japeri, and Queimados cities, in addition to Mag\u00e9 and Guapimirim cities, which make up a transition with the Metropolitan East. The metropolitan west end has less urban characteristics and a restructuring process supported by recent investments in new logistical and industrial enterprises. The Metropolitan Area of Rio de Janeiro and Baixada Fluminense present serious structural problems involving lack of basic sanitation (water and sewage), irregular occupations, and deficiency in health equipment, among many others. The Baixada Fluminense is connected to important traffic routes and railway axes destined for the movement of workers and goods, the poor conditions of housing, income, and basic sanitation.

With a dense population, largely with precarious living conditions, with insufficient medical facilities and equipment in its territory, and great difficulty in promoting social distanceeither because of the need to build income or because of the very limitations of housing-Baixada Fluminense became a sad laboratory capable of responding to Mike Davis' concerns. In this scenario, it is essential to highlight the effect of the divestment promoted by an agenda of fiscal adjustments that hit the Brazilian reality more acutely. In fact, we remember the words of David Harvey (2007) on the neoliberalism economy when it indicates economic adjustments in essential areas (such as health) can produce significant impacts in poor's populations. Urban-peripheral areas, such as Baixada Fluminense, are the first to suffer a collapse of their health system, resulting in fewer hospitals, beds, and equipment and reaffirming a framework of territorial injustices. Therefore, the increase in the number of cases of COVID-19 in these cities aggravates a crisis scenario in health. The problematic case of public health is not exclusively for Brazil; As per WHO, all of the countries of the World Periphery exhibits almost the same scenario in responding to the present problems-for a significant portion of the population the access to effective health care during the emergency seems nothing but a reverie (WHO 2018) .",
