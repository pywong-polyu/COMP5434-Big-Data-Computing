Post-acute and long-term care organizations were especially impacted and rapidly became epicenters of the coronavirus epidemic and its response. A study of COVID-19 mortality across 12 countries conducted in July 2020 found that mortality rates for older persons in long-term care were 24 times those of community-dwelling older persons and 664 times higher than those of community-dwelling younger persons. 1 In response, the practice of long-term care medicine changed rapidly. Recommendations for full personal protective equipment (PPE), which beforehand had been rarely used, became commonplace. Employee and resident screening and visitor restrictions were implemented, 2 accompanied by logistical challenges and resident and family stress. 3 Telemedicine, which before 2020 had been rare, 4 suddenly became commonplace, as long-intrenched policies by regulators and insurers melted away in response to the need to limit in-person medical assessments in locked-down long-term care settings. 5 Onsite laboratories, which had entirely disappeared from most nursing homes, saw a minor resurgence as homes needed to rapidly retool to manage on-site COVID-19 testing. 6 Nursing home infection control activities, which had been modestly bolstered by recent regulations, 7 were found inadequate for the task of dealing with such an unprecedented unanticipated onslaught, 8 and calls were put forth to attend to assisted living in the time of In response to these and other challenges, collaboration between long-term care organizations and other health care sectorsdparticularly health departments and hospital systemsdmushroomed. 10,11 Indeed, the world of post-acute and long-term care was thrust into the limelight and turned inside out and upside down during 2020.",

            "text": "As part of this rapid shift in priorities, the world of academic publishing also changed. The timeline from data collection to publication quickened, particularly for papers about COVID-19. 14 Reports about the novel coronavirus and COVID-19 disease were prioritized, with the goal of getting them into the literature as quickly as possible. 15 Reviews of COVID-19erelated papers were frequently accelerated, and the practice of providing online availability of preprints, often before final editing and author approval, became commonplace. 15 The move toward increased open access publishing accelerated as well, with many academic journals (including JAMDA) making all COVID-19erelated papers freely available online. 16 These changes in publishing, plus the continued growth of online journals (many of which are not indexed), combined with the boom in coronavirus-related research, resulted in an overall increase of published papers. 13 This accelerated pace of academic publishing has had its drawbacks. Concerns have been raised about the quality of much of the research, and that the practice of releasing preprint articles aggravates this concern. One recent article in the Journal of Medical Ethics, for example, noted that by May 2020, ClinicalTrials.gov had registered more than 1200 COVID-related trials and expressed concern that practices of good research, such as reflection on methods, quality checks by researchers and their supervisors, and robust ethics reviews, were being compromised. 17 Concerns about the quality of peer review have been raised as well, because of resource limitations from increased article submissions and reviewer stress from new clinical and at-home obligations. Such fears were bolstered by an increase in retractions of scientific studies, particularly about COVID-19. 17e19 The COVID-19 pandemic has been stressful for scientists and academic authors and affected their ongoing research efforts. Many clinical trials, particularly those involving older populations such as persons with Alzheimer's disease or residing in long-term care settings, were disrupted or terminated entirely because of concerns about safety risk for participants and research staff. 20, 21 Laboratory research suffered, too, and the work of early career investigators was noted to have been especially impacted. 22 Clinician-scientists were additionally affected because many were pressed into extra duty to assist in the pandemic response, and some became ill with the disease. Particularly impacted were women with small children, because the transition of many schools to in-home, virtual teaching and the closing of many day care centers reduced available work time. 23e25",

Most (76%) of this increase consisted of papers about COVID-19. As has been the case in scientific publishing overall, publications related to this new disease have not been associated with a reduction but rather an increase in publications in other areas as well. Figure 1 displays these trends. Although impressive, JAMDA's submission increase is no greater than that experienced by many other journals, despite the disproportionate burden it has placed on long-term care populations. 12, 13 This point speaks well about the commitment of those engaged in research related to post-acute and long-term care medicine. Figure 1 indicates that 2020's noneCOVID-19 submissions (shown by the green line), were relatively similar to overall 2019 submissions (shown by the dotted line), indicating that the large volume of 2020 COVID-19 submissions (red line) supplemented rather than supplanted ongoing research, and that in 2020, the amount of noneCOVID-19 research did not change markedly compared to the previous year. Those figures are good news, because all of the issues relevant to post-acute and long-term care that existed preeCOVID-19 remained during COVID-19.",
