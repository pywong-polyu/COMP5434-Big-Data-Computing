Methods: We developed and distributed a questionnaire to pediatric surgery residents in our institution who were registered from January 2015-July 2020. The questionnaire was consisting of 24 questions: a) the perspectives of residents about COVID-19 infection during their residency program; b) the learning process; c) academic evaluations; and d) residents' suggestions to improve the quality of their residency program during the outbreak. Results: Most (82.6%) pediatric surgery residents agreed that elective surgeries should be postponed during the pandemic. Before the outbreak, almost all (82.6%) residents used textbooks and journals as their primary sources of learning, while during the outbreak, 69.5% of residents shifted to use online lectures either from the school or Association of Pediatric Surgeons. Interestingly, 91.3% of participants agreed that they had more time to complete their academic assignments during the pandemic. Conclusions: The pandemic has had a significant impact on the development of pediatric surgery residency programs. Moreover, the responses to the questionnaire are affected by the seniority and sex of the residents. A comprehensive approach is needed to maintain the high standard of competence of pediatric surgery without compromising our safety from the COVID-19 infection risk.",

When compared with the importance of the residents safeguarding the well-being of their families from the possibility of getting cross-infected by COVID-19 due to the residents' potential exposure at the hospital, the training program was no longer considered as important anymore for the residents [3] . Moreover, since the COVID-19 pandemic, we have shifted our morning report from off-line to online meetings. Most residents are satisfied with the changes, although some residents thought that offline morning report was better to gain skills and knowledge than online meetings (Table 3 ). Some residents agreed that the skills and knowledge can be achieved by both offline and online morning report. It does not mean that they do not have a preference in the reporting style. However, they believed that the changes in the morning report method is to adapt to the pandemic and the results are good, while the offline morning report is still considered good too. We also evaluated the learning process regarding the competence gained during the pandemic. Our data showed that most residents believe that their competence is declining during the pandemic. This finding might be associated with the fact that almost all elective surgical cases were postponed during the pandemic. Postponing elective surgeries occurred in every country affected by the COVID-19, including the USA [3] and Australia [7] . Most residents agreed that live view surgery with virtual outpatient services and ward rounds will be useful to solve this challenge.",
