            "text": "Background: Triglyceride to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-c) is crucial when researching metabolic and vascular diseases, and its involvement in COVID-19 was sparsely elaborated on. The purpose of the study was to explore the inflammatory associations between the TG/HDL-c ratio and COVID-19 prognosis. Methods: A total of 262 COVID-19 patients consisting of 244 survivors and 18 non-survivors were retrospectively investigated. The clinical features and baseline hematological parameters were recorded and analyzed. The receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was used to explore the role of TG/HDL-c in predicting the mortality of COVID-19, the Spearman's rank correlation coefficients were used to measure the correlation between TG/HDL-c and inflammatory indicators, and the Kaplan-Meier (KM) curve was used to estimate the survival of COVID-19 patients with high and low TG/HDL-c ratio. Logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the role of TG/HDL-c ratio on mortality of COVID-19 with no underlying diseases. Results: Compared with the survivors, the non-survivors of COVID-19 had significantly higher levels of white blood cells (4.7 vs 13.0 \u00d7 10 9 /L; P < 0.001), neutrophils (3.0 vs 11.6 \u00d7 10 9 /L; P < 0.001), C-reactive proteins (15.7 vs 76.7 mg/L; P < 0.001) and TG/HDL-c ratio (1.4 vs 2.5; P = 0.001). The ROC curve [area under the curve (AUC), 0.731; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.609-0.853; P = 0.001] suggested that the TG/HDL-c ratio could predict the mortality of COVID-19. The TG/HDL-c ratio was positively correlated with white blood cells (r = 0.255, P < 0.001), neutrophils (r = 0.243, P < 0.001) and C-reactive proteins (r = 0.170, P < 0.006). Patients with high TG/ HDL-c ratio showed a worse survival compared with those with low TG/HDL-c ratio (Log rank P = 0.003). Moreover, TG/HDL-c ratio was an independent factor in predicting the mortality of COVID-19 patients with no underlying diseases. Conclusion: Our study demonstrated that TG/HDL-c ratio might potentially be a predictive marker for mortality in COVID-19 patients.",

            "text": "Undoubtedly, dyslipidemia is strongly associated with obesity and obesity-related disorders, and is commonly found in patients with stroke, insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular diseases. [3] [4] [5] [6] Over recent years, obese state has been characterized by oxidative stress. 7 It was reported that hypertrophied adipocytes, which promoted the dysfunction of adipose tissue, could produce a high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS), participating in many metabolic signaling pathways, such as insulin sensitivity, inflammation, and endothelial dysfunction. Meanwhile, inflammation could lead to a rapid spike in levels of ROS, which established a feedback-loop between inflammation and oxidative stress. 7 Increase in triglyceride (TG) and decrease in high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) may be caused by inflammatory cytokines, and it has been suggested that triglyceride to high density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (TG/HDL-c ratio), a simple, non-invasive, and convenient measurement indicator, could integrate predictive risks of two parameters into a single risk factor and showed better predictive value than TG and HDL-c alone in atherosclerotic disturbances, 8 and our results were consistent with the study (in Supplementary Figures 1 and 2 ). Klisic et al demonstrated that TG/HDL-c had positive correlation with high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) and inflammatory biomarker cystatin C in adolescent girls. 9 Idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) patients with higher TG/ HDL-c ratio were prone to suffer from systemic inflammation. 10 As for COVID-19, it was reported that TG/HDL-c ratio was a determining of cardiovascular risk in COVID-19; 11 low HDL and high triglyceride could predict the severity of COVID-19; 12 TG/HDL-c ratio was correlated with indicators for severity of COVID-19, such as levels of lactate dehydrogenase, National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS 2), and quick sequential organ failure assessment, which could be a biomarker for poor prognosis with requirement of invasive mechanical ventilation. 13 Nevertheless, there are few studies with respect to the inflammatory correlation between TG/HDL-c ratio and the prognosis of COVID-19, which reminds to be further elaborated on. In view of the current status of COVID-19 pandemic and the potential role of TG/ HDL-c ratio mentioned above, this study was performed with the purpose to clarify the inflammatory relationship of TG/HDL-c ratio and the mortality of COVID-19 patients, so as to provide potential reference for monitoring and preventing COVID-19 progression.",

            "text": "It has been verified that TG levels might increase during infection and inflammation. 15, 16 Inflammatory cytokines might contribute to TG synthesis and reduce TG hydrolysis under septic conditions, 17 and could also increase the angiopoietin-like protein 4 expressions that might further suppress TG-rich lipoprotein metabolism. 18 In addition, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 was reported to produce a rapid rise in TG concentration through increasing hepatic production. 18 Without doubt, due to social isolation and long period of stay at home, people were prone to have an imbalanced diet and be less active, which might further worsen their metabolic and lipid profiles to induce hypertriglyceridemia eventually. 19 Hypertriglyceridemia can cause endothelial dysfunction, thus leading to a higher susceptibility to complications related to cardiovascular diseases in COVID-19 patients. 20 Furthermore, TG could regulate the expression of angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2) protein through methylenetetrahydrofolate 21 Meanwhile, it was reported that TG was associated with the excessive activation of macrophages, 22 positive with the levels of CRP and procalcitonin, 23 and the level was significantly increased in COVID-19 patients with poor prognoses. 24 The most striking function of HDL is to facilitate reverse cholesterol transport from tissues to the liver. 25 HDL particles are crucial for the immune system and defense against infectious diseases, which can mitigate inflammatory responses during sepsis, 26, 27 and function against RNA and DNA viruses. 28 In addition, HDL has the greatest affinity for binding and neutralizing lipopolysaccharides and lipoteichoic acid, 29 and also exerts antithrombotic 30 and antioxidant effects. 31 Using genetic variants as risk factors, a prior research identified that genetically determined increased levels of HDL-c exhibited an association with reduced mortality from sepsis. 16 At the same time, it was suggested that a genetic variant in cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP), rs1800777, was related to the level of HDL-c in septic patients, 32 and CETP inhibitor might be a potential therapy for sepsis. 33 Some viral infections causing inflammation also resulted in dyslipidemia, in which HIV patients had a decreased HDL-c levels, 34, 35 and patients with hepatitis B in the cirrhosis phase showed lower HDL-c levels. 36 Recently, it has been reported that COVID-19 patients with declined HDL-c 992 concentrations had longer time for viral nucleic acid amplification test turning negative than those with normal levels, 37 and lower HDL-c levels exhibited an association with the severity of COVID-19 in patients. 38 In view of the above, it has been well documented that there may be a marked decrease in HDL-c concentrations during the acute phase response, however, the mechanisms underlying this decrease are not clearly defined. Apolipoprotein A1 (ApoA-1), a major structural protein of HDL-c, was reported to be decreased together with lower HDL-c when pro-inflammatory cytokines (eg, IL-6 and CRP) inhibited the activity of apolipoprotein synthesis enzymes. 24, 27 Serum amyloid A (SAA)-enriched HDL displaced and decreased ApoA-1 levels, and scavenged HDL more rapidly, which was significantly higher in patients diagnosed with severe COVID-19. 17,24 Paraoxonase 1 (PON1), an antioxidant enzyme of HDL, could be inactivated under oxidative stress and further weaken HDL functions. 39 Moreover, hemodilution, consumption of HDL particles, and capillary leaks could also explain the decreased HDL concentration, all of which might be applicable for COVID-19 patients. 27, 40 In addition, impaired antioxidant properties of HDL could cause lipid oxidation, hence inducing inflammation and accentuating tissue damage. 20 Consequently, HDL-c deficiency can induce cytokine overproduction, and these overproduced cytokines can in turn prime the depletion of HDL-c, thus promoting a vicious cycle in severe patients. Collectively, systemic inflammatory responses can cause hypertriglyceridemia and decrease HDL-c, resulting in an increase in TG/HDL-c ratio. Inflammatory cells can accelerate the release of various cytokines in the pathophysiological process during SARS-CoV-2 infection, thus leading to a cytokine storm that may induce rapid development in multiple organ dysfunctions or even death. 41 Abundant evidence in the past has indicated that there was a strong association of compromised immune functions and excessive inflammatory response with mortality from COVID-19. [42] [43] [44] In the current study, the TG/HDL-c ratio was positively related to the levels of WBC, neutrophils, and CRP. These findings were similar to the study mentioned that IPAH patients with elevated TG/HDL-c ratio had elevated levels of IL-1\u03b2, MCP-1, and IL-6. 10 In our further analysis, a ROC curve and KM curve were generated with the discovery that TG/HDL-c ratio was probably an alternative prognostic predictor for COVID-19. Based on the findings presented above, it can be speculated that inflammation monitoring might be useful in predicting the mortality of COVID-19 patients who had elevated TG/HDL-c ratio. Anyway, further investigations are required for the elaboration of specific mechanisms of TG/HDL-c ratio on COVID-19.",

[48] [49] [50] [51] [52] Moreover, HDL-increasing drugs, such as cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT) and Niacin, have also been studied as potential therapeutic strategies for COVID-19 treatment. 47, 49 The study still has some limitations. First, due to the retrospective analysis, relevant variables (eg, BMI) were not identified in our study and the small sample size of survivors, which might cause bias. Next, the time patients having lipids tests was in different phase of COVID-19 infection for the reason of earlier or later onset of symptoms to enter the hospital which could also make a bias. Third, there is not a public database providing biomarkers before patients suffered diseases, which might make the research more convincing. Fourth, there was no further detection of TG and HDL-c levels in patients during hospitalization. Dynamic monitoring might be a better characterization for dyslipidemia. Finally, lipid metabolism can be affected by various factors, such as dietary preferences and habits, and the mechanisms should be further studied.",
