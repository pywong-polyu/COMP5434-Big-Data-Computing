            "text": "Open access often result in functional and cognitive impairment and a reduction in health-related quality of life. 11 Treatment options for GAD include pharmacotherapy (eg, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, selective serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, benzodiazepines) and psychological treatment (i.e., cognitive behavioural therapy, applied relaxation, 11 metacognitive therapy, acceptance-based therapy or mindfulness). 12 13 As well as in other mental disorders, a stepped-care model, in which therapies are applied sequentially depending on the severity of the disorder and the response to previous treatments, is recommended. The stepped-care model is used to organise the provision of services and to help people with GAD, their families and healthcare professionals to choose the most effective interventions for each case. 11 Shared decision-making (SDM) is currently advocated as the gold standard of the interaction between patients and healthcare providers, both from an ethical (i.e., respecting patient's autonomy) and a practical perspective. SDM is aimed at incorporating patients' preferences and values regarding available treatment options into the decision-making process, avoiding professionals' paternalism in their relationship and communication with patients. SDM should take place in all phases of care to facilitate evidence-based information about treatments and discussion of the possible options. 14 15 The final aim of SDM is to help patients make decisions that are objectively informed and congruent with their own values regarding the treatments' potential consequences. 16 Patient decision aids (PtDAs) are one of the most used interventions to promote SDM between healthcare professionals and patients. These tools can be developed in different formats (e.g., booklet, video, software, web) and include evidence-based information about the target disease and the available treatment options, with quantitative empirical data about potential benefits and risks of complications/adverse effects. They also try to promote an explicit or implicit reflection in patients about their own values and preferences concerning such potential consequences of treatments. 17 PtDAs can be used before the clinical encounter, preparing patients to discuss their concerns and preferences about the options or in interaction with the professional during the consultation. The last update of the Cochrane systematic review of PtDAs for treatment or diagnostic decisions 15 showed, compared with control groups, a pooled 23% relative improvement in objective knowledge about the disorder and treatments and twice as many patients with accurate risk perceptions and decisions congruent with their own values, respectively. PtDAs also decrease decisional conflict (i.e., uncertainty about own knowledge and preferences, and about the course of action to take) and reduce the number of people who are passive in decision-making by 32%. 15 Nevertheless, in the field of mental health and especially in GAD, the number of interventions to promote SDM is still limited. [18] [19] [20] In the above mentioned Cochrane review, none of the 105 randomised trials addressed patients with ADs. Several studies have shown that many mental health patients want to be involved in the decisions about their care 21 22 and that clinical experts in specialised psychiatric care give value to interventions to promote SDM. 23 24 Therefore, the development and assessment of PtDAs in the field of ADs could help to reduce this gap and help patients to participate in the decision-making process.",

Therefore, given the existing shortage of PtDAs for patients with GAD, the aims of this study are (1) to develop a PtDA for patients with GAD using internationally recommended procedures and (2) to assess the effectiveness of the PtDA in terms of improving the decisional process in patients with GAD.",

Synthesis of the available evidence: the recommendations from the updated CPG for the treatment of patients with GAD 27 will be used to develop the PtDA. Other existing PtDAs addressing patients with GAD will be also taken into consideration. 2. Creation of project management groups (PMGs): the PMG will be composed of an Expert Committee with six to eight participants from primary and specialised healthcare (i.e., family physicians, psychiatrists, nurses and psychologists) and four to five patients with GAD and their relatives and/or caregivers. Furthermore, a technical team (web designers and developers) and a scientific team (clinical experts and researchers) will be created. The group is at the heart of the development process and the people in this group have editorial control and make the final decisions on content specification, design and testing phases. The group will also undertake the early evaluation during prototype testing. 3. Development of the PtDA: the safety and effectiveness evidence of the different treatment options, based on the recommendations of the CPG, 27 will be analysed and discussed by the scientific team to provide the main contents and a recommended structure. Presentation designs and technical issues will be discussed with the technical team. Finally, a first version of the PtDA will be developed according to the International Patients Decision Aid Standards (IPDAS). 30 4. Content review: All members of the Expert Committee will assess the first version of the PtDA. Presentation and content issues will be reviewed and refined by means of an iterative process. This review process will be carried out through virtual or face-to-face meetings. As a result of this process, a second version of the PtDA will be developed. 5. Field testing: ten patients with GAD (with all degrees of severity) will test the PtDA, evaluating its acceptability in terms of content (clarity, quantity and usefulness of information), format issues, structure and navigability. The scientific team will collect qualitative and quantitative information from field testing. After modifying these aspects highlighted by patients in order to improve the PtDA, it will be ready to move to step 2 (effectiveness assessment).",

If they refuse to complete the follow-up questionnaires, we will try to record at least their actual treatment choice. Nonetheless, multiple imputation will be used to minimise the risk of attrition bias. At follow-up, health behaviours will not be assessed (e.g., adherence, physical activity), and although the GAD-7 questionnaire will be included in the assessment, there will be no hypothesising on changes on health outcomes. The primary aim of PtDAs is to promote involvement in decision-making and quality of decisions, and the evidence about their effects on health behaviours and outcomes is currently scarce and mixed.",
