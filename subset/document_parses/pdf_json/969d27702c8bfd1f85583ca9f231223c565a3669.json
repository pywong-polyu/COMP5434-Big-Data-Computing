In the tourism industry, new digital-savvy players like Airbnb have entered and created entirely new market segments, while many existing players are challenged to redefine their business logic. However, the literature does not provide a generic overview of the value network in tourism, including new market players, and their ways of interacting. Therefore, this paper develops a current overview of the value network of the European tourism ecosystem. By analyzing the business models and value streams of 704 European enterprises based on Crunchbase data, we identified 27 distinct roles and their respective interrelations in the domain. To validate the proposed value network, we conducted five expert interviews. Our results highlight the continuously growing importance of intermediaries in tourism. Furthermore, new technology players offer new opportunities for innovative services, creating high dynamism in the industry. Nonetheless, local entities, such as residents and communities, play a central role in European tourism and need to be included in experiences provided to tourists. Scholars and practitioners might use the results to identify disruptive actors and opportunities for innovation and niche creation. Additionally, the results can be used as a basis for further analysis of the ecosystem's ongoing changes induced through technological advancements or external events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "Digital transformation led to the emergence of highly complex relationships among actors and industry players who can no longer be grouped into suppliers, customers, and competitors [7, 24] . Having evolved from this classical value chain perspective, the concept of ecosystems goes beyond linear relationships and describes a group of loosely interacting and interdependent actors [14] . Firms such as Google, Amazon.com, and Alibaba leverage a large network of actors that provide complementary products and services. [35] defines \"business ecosystems\" as \"[\u2026] the community of organizations, institutions, and individuals that impact the enterprise and the enterprise's customers and supplies.\" Digitally-enabled transformation of many different industries, from linear value chains to highly interrelated and interdependent ecosystems, also affects the tourism ecosystem. Transferring this notion of \"ecosystems\" to tourism is justified due to the involved actors' complexity and interrelatedness, as [2] showed regarding tourism destinations. In this study's context, extending this view when \"zooming-out,\" the generic term tourism ecosystem describes not only destinations and their actors but also the respective tourism ecosystem and its actors in any one country and region. Therefore, the tourism ecosystem in Europe as this study's unit of analysis entails all stakeholders and their interactions and also the resulting interrelations in this particular region. Prior work has introduced different concepts to describe ongoing changes and consequences induced by digital technologies in tourism, and the next sections present these concepts in more detail.",

Smart tourism offers an integrated perspective on data, technological infrastructure, and the creation of business value. Moreover, smart tourism ecosystems (STEs) describe tourism systems that take advantage of smart technology in several ways. STEs are characterized by intensive information sharing and value co-creation among actors and include a variety of \"species\" such as touristic and residential consumers, tourism suppliers, tourism intermediaries, and others [11] who co-create value within tourism ecosystems. An example of a local smart tourism ecosystem is the region of Salerno, Italy. Political administrative structures, such as the municipality and provincial tourism authority, periodically contact hosts, update them on events in the city, and invite them to regular meetings [27] . While the terms above describe different phenomena resulting from the impact of digital technologies on tourism in general, prior work was reluctant to analyze and discuss implications for a tourism ecosystem as the unit of analysis. Thus, this work aims to uncover advanced digital technologies' effects on different touristic and increasingly technology-focused actors and their respective interrelations subsumed into the tourism ecosystem in Europe.",

We extracted a dataset on September 13, 2018, applying the category \"tourism\" and the location \"headquarter in Europe.\" This provided 851 European companies categorized as tourism companies according to Crunchbase. We excluded 124 companies no longer in existence. Then, we excluded further 23 companies classified into several categories close to tourism, but their value proposition was neither directly nor indirectly relevant to the industry. Thus, their relation to the tourism domain was nonexistent according to our understanding of the respective companies. Our final sample consisted of 704 companies. Using this sample, we performed a structured content analysis to develop categories inductively, i.e., generic roles, based on [20] and [21] . In addition to the information available in Crunchbase, we used publicly available information from the Internet, such as homepages of respective companies as well as reports, press articles, and annual reports. To ensure coding consistency, three experts individually coded the 704 organizations. To become familiar with the coding scheme, in the beginning, each expert coded 50 companies individually. Afterward, we compared and discussed these 50 organizations' coding for calibration purposes. Once this step was completed, all experts coded half the organizations independently, followed by another calibration step. Based on this, the remaining organizations were again coded independently by the three experts. All authors discussed the coding and discrepancies, eventually eliminating individual disparities and reaching consensus [9] . Then, we derived interrelations and value streams between generated roles through structured content analysis [20] . The concept of value systems was introduced by Porter and further extended to value networks to analyze industries, its' roles, inherent functions, activities, and their interrelations: value streams [6, 24] . To derive the value streams, we again used all available information. Primarily, we checked explicit interrelations these companies have with other companies, using the information provided about partners, customers, and suppliers of individual organizations on their public homepages and in other sources, such as newspapers.",

Due to the experts' extensive experience and their different roles and approaches to the industry, a variety of interrelations were revised, and nine roles were added or changed in the final ecosystem. In an additional step to validate our findings, we randomly extracted 50 American-based tourism organizations from Crunchbase in October 2020. We chose American based companies due to the much easier accessibility and comprehensibility of additional information online via websites and blogs. The research team extended this sample, to deliberately include the well-known players Airbnb, Booking.com, and Tripadvisor. Two researchers then successfully coded all 53 companies into existing roles. As such, the identified roles seem suitable for non-European players, increasing the validity and generalizability of our findings outside the European tourism ecosystem.",

Based on our structured content analysis of 704 organizations' Crunchbase data, Table 1 displays 27 roles identified in the ecosystem. Besides existing roles, we identified new roles that have emerged in recent years because of technological developments. Of course, one organization can act in different roles by offering different services to other players. The central roles in the current tourism ecosystem are still tourists, intermediaries, and tourism experience providers. The tourism domain's generic network shows that the industry transformed into a heterogeneous, multi-sided network: Next to this \"core\" of the ecosystem, sharing economy services substitute a share of experiences provided previously only by tourism experience providers. This role's importance has grown within the last decade, challenging existing actors. Specialized marketing, promotion, and consultancy services reflect a purely B2B relationship toward intermediaries and tourism experience providers. Online communities play a special role, capturing tourists' content and emotions and influencing touristic purchase decisions. Technology providers ensure the ecosystem's functioning by operating digital infrastructure and offering relevant software solutions and relevant data for the ecosystem. Next to these, disruptive technology providers evolve, using such technologies as AR to provide new experiences for tourists, as well as B2B services such as the Internet of Things (IoT) and blockchain-based solutions. Disruptive technology providers challenge existing actors, mostly the roles of tourism experience providers, as well as technology providers.

Nowadays, tourists consume \"experiences\" rather than services, reflecting their increasing expectations. Aggregated bundles of services must complement each other to provide a sound and complete tourist experience [23, 25] . As such, tourists' purchase decisions are highly influenced by ratings (sometimes even referred to as the \"rating economy\") provided by specialized touristic entities (e.g., TripAdvisor), integrated ratings of intermediaries (such as booking.com), but also by content provided in social networks.

Next to that core, the role of sharing economy services has increased within the domain. We show the emergence of new, disruptive actors, offering experiences for end-users, as well as pure B2B services. The ecosystem acknowledges the relevance of digital technologies in enabling increased levels of servitization, i.e. in building value for touristic experiences [4] , and value co-creation among actors. As such, the availability of data-based services has and still is growing within the tourism ecosystem. In particular analytics services emerge due to more open data in tourism and larger data volumes available [18, 34] , offering great benefits for touristic experiences, but increasing the complexity for the players in the industry.",

Prior work has often diminished the use of digital technologies in tourism to e-tourism or smart tourism, positioning this hugely disruptive phenomenon as a sub-discipline of tourism [13] . Yet, a holistic overview of this highly dynamic ecosystem, with different actors and their mutual value interactions was missing as a basis for a more comprehensive understanding of digital technologies' impacts on tourism as a whole. By identifying ecosystem actors and their interactions, we directly follow the call by [11] to identify roles and value streams in tourism and [13] to enrich tourism research using multidisciplinary approaches. Scholars and practitioners can apply our results to identify opportunities for innovative experiences for tourists, as well as new B2B services. Furthermore, disruptive actors can be uncovered, and existing white spots in the ecosystem can be transparently mapped. Active organizations can apply the model to identify potential threats to their current market positions and evaluate potential opportunities to adapt their business models. Besides that, results may be used as a basis for further analysis of the ecosystem's ongoing changes induced through technological advancements or external events such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Additionally, coding is always partly subjective. To understand interrelations among different actors, we relied on publicly available information, such as reports, press articles, or companies' websites. However, by validating our results with five experts, the mentioned limitations were mitigated, but not fully eliminated. To generalize our findings further, empirical research is necessary. Besides that, tourism connects various industries. As such, further actors from other ecosystems could be included, especially from the payment and insurance sectors, which also play a vital role in touristic experiences. However, because our goal was to focus deliberately on tourism-actors, these entities are not included in the dataset used and thus not reflected in the resulting ecosystem.",

If actual revenue shares among different actors were understood in more detail, it would be possible to make objective statements about power shares within the industry. Based on this, the dynamics within this ecosystem can be studied, i.e., understanding how these shares will shift in the future and how the business models employed by providers will evolve [29] . Besides existing actors' importance, studying actual models of services and experience-provision can give valuable insights. One interesting trend observed in tourism, compared to other industries, is the importance of the public sector as well as the integration of local communities' into service provision. Future research can provide valuable insights into whether and how these entities can be better integrated.",
