Yet there is a lack of validated questionnaires that measure these attitudes. The goal of our study was to construct and validate such a questionnaire and use it to assess attitudes of Croatian scientists. We first developed a 21-item questionnaire called Attitudes towards Open data sharing, preprinting, and peer-review (ATOPP), which had a reliable four-factor structure, and measured attitudes towards open data, preprint servers, open peer-review and open peer-review in small scientific communities. We then used the ATOPP to explore attitudes of Croatian scientists (n = 541) towards these topics, and to assess the association of their attitudes with their open science practices and demographic information. Overall, Croatian scientists' attitudes towards these topics were generally neutral, with a median (Md) score of 3.3 out of max 5 on the scale score. We also found no gender (P = 0.995) or field differences (P = 0.523) in their attitudes. However, attitudes of scientist who previously engaged in open peer-review or preprinting were higher than of scientists that did not (Md 3.5 vs. 3.3, P<0.001, and Md 3.6 vs 3.3, P<0.001, respectively). Further research is needed to determine optimal ways of increasing scientists' attitudes and their open science practices.",

With the principles and values of openness rooted in the idea of scientific knowledge being a common good [1] . The term open science was coined in 2001 by Recep i.e., preprints, before those manuscripts were peer reviewed and published in journals (or other venues, such as books or conference proceedings). However, it took a while for prepint servers to become the go to place for researchers. For example, it took arXiv 8 years to become a major player in the dissemination of results in physics and mathematics [21] . Other scholarly fields have been even slower to adapt to the preprint culture: with bioRxiv, a preprint server dedicated to the biological sciences, originating in 2013, SocArXiv a server for preprints in social sciences in 2016, and MedRxiv, a server for clinical research preprints, in June of 2019 [19] . Further actualization and discussions surrounding preprint servers, also rose after Chalmers and Glasziou estimated that 85% of research is wasted due to inadequate research design or methodology, poor reporting, publication bias, and lack of scholarly openness [22] , with some viewing preprint serves as a way to address some of these issues. Today, there are more than 60 preprint servers in the world covering all scholarly fields [23] , and the number of preprints is rising, fuelled additionally by the COVID-19 pandemic [24] . Preprints are seen as a step toward greater openness of science, and in 2019, Fu and Hughey estimated that manuscripts first published as preprints received 36% more citations and had a 49% higher Altmetric score [25] . Increasing number of journals and funders today encourage preprinting [26] . Furthermore, many scholarly engines have started indexing preprints, e.g. Europe PMC [20] , Scopus [18] , and Dimensions [27] .",

            "text": "Peer-review is a quality control mechanism for scholarly research or funding proposals. Traditionally, journal peer-review was most commonly blind (single, double or triple blind) and it was often criticised for being slow, expensive, subjective, not able to detect errors, non-reliable, prone to bias and easily abused [28] . This lead to growing need for a more open peer-review process [29] . Open peer-review as a term, however, lacks a universal definition [7] . Most often it used to describe one of the following practices: open identities of the authors and reviewers, open review reports published alongside the article, open interaction and discussion between author(s) and reviewers, or open platforms where a review is facilitated by a different entity than the one where the paper is published [7, 24, 30] . In our study, we consider open peer review to be open (public) sharing of review reports (with or without reviewers' names) as part of the journal or grant peer review processes. Practice and uptake of open peer review, however has been low, with less than 1% of journals today practicing it [31] , and, to the best of our knowledge, no known estimates of its use by funders is available. We are not aware of any studies, that analysed attitudes towards open data, preprinting and peer-review with a validated questionnaire. It was, therefore, our goal to construct and validate such a questionnaire; and use it to report attitudes towards open data, preprinting and open peer-review of Croatian scientists, as well as on the association between their attitudes and open science practices or their demographic information.",

While one-item questions can be a useful method for \"snapshot measuring\" [34] , measuring attitudes with only a single question is generally not considered an optimal approach.

The ATOPP scale, consisting of 21 items, demonstrated good internal consistency and validity. Because of its good psychometrical characteristics and relatively small number of questions, we believe that it represents a fast measurement that can be used in assessing or monitoring attitudes towards open science, thus allowing cross-cultural validation. During ATOPP development, attitudes towards open peer review in small scientific communities turned out to be a separate factor (subscale) from attitudes toward open peer review. This could be a product of both the fact that Croatian scientific community for centuries had a higher number of specialized journals per capita compared to its neighbouring countries, and the fact that open peer review in small (national) fields or subfields has higher likelihood of reviewers being direct competitors for funding or job positions [58] . Additionally, smaller communities may experience greater fear of negative consequences of open peer review, i.e., fear of a potential (vindictive) backlash of their colleagues if they criticize their work, or if due to their review, they negatively affected funding or publication opportunities of their colleagues. And these fears will likely remain until external evaluations or strong protective mechanisms are put into practice (however, for small communities these approaches likely face significant language barriers and high costs). Based on the ATOPP questionnaire, we then found that the Croatian scientists had generally neutral attitudes toward open science. Their most positive attitudes were towards open data, while their attitude towards preprinting and towards open peer-review were neutral, and those towards open peer review in smaller scientific communities were negative. We also found no gender or scholarly field differences in respondents' overall attitude scores. However, scientists who already had experience with open science practices, i.e., shared data, provided open peer review reports in the past, or posted preprints, had generally more positive attitudes previous open science education are in accordance with Bem's self-perception theory that confirms effect of past behavior on internal attitude [59] . Past behaviour influence on attitudes was also confirmed by many researchers since then [60, 61] . We have also found that participants who had taken open science courses had more positive ATOPP scale score, preprinting score and open peer-review score. which is a confirmation of a model that positive attitudes are related to intention to behave and behavior [32] . The positive attitudes towards open data in our study were associated with the high prevalence of researchers in our sample (46%) that shared their data in the past. However, in the recent survey by Zhu (2020) in the United Kingdom on 1724 participants from various scholarly fields, there were less participants (21%) who had deposited primary data in online repositories, although majority (86%) had a very positive attitude towards data sharing [12] . However, in that survey, attitude was only measured by a single question \"How important do you think it is, in general, to make research data available online for reuse?\".",

These results differ from attitudes participants in South Korea [50], China [49] , and Latin America [62] whose attitudes were overall found to be positive; but those surveys included more editors, and all (China), or many respondents who previously posted a preprint (Korea (32% editors, 15% past preprint users; and Latin America, 40% past preprint users), while in our sample only 12% of scientists did so and we had only 11% of editorial board members in the sample [49, 50] . Additionally, China introduced a country preprint server ChinaXiv in 2006, and Latin America in 2020 (ScIELO preprints), which most likely further promoted already strong open access culture in those countries (Croatia does not have a national preprint server). Croatian scientist preprint use in our study, is in the line with a large analysis of Biorxiv preprints (n = 67,885, in the period from 2013 to 2019), which found that senior authors of preprints are often researchers from the United States (39.2%) and the United Kingdom (10.5%), while Croatia was described as a \"contributor country\" whose authors were rarely on senior authorship positions [63] . More studies are, however, needed to determine the main factors that drive researchers to start preprinting manuscripts or project proposals (protocols), as well as inviting or choosing to wait for public comments before deciding to submit the preprint for scholarly journal peer review. Additionally, previous survey has shown that scientist choices toward posting a preprint are influenced by the policies of the journals in which they plan to publish those studies [62, 64] . Although Croatia has approximately 400 active scholarly journals [65] of which less than half are indexed in WoS or Scopus [66] , preprint policies are listed for only 24 in Sherpa website, and so further research is needed to determine the influence of Croatia's editorial, funder and publishing milieu on the preprint attitudes of its researchers.",

As all questionnaires, are data are based on self-declared attitudes and open science practices and does not capture independently confirmed practices. Furthermore, as in many recent online surveys, our response rates were low, and that rate might have also been influenced by the fact that the questionnaire was sent during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, we might have captured opinions only of those interested in these topics, which, if true, could mean that the attitudes of a representative sample of Croatian scientists would be even lower towards these topics. While we did provide definitions of open science practices in our questionnaire, as most of our respondents (78%) did not have education in open science, it is possible some held different ideas of those practices. Finally, while our study, showed a strong association between open sciences attitudes and previous open science practices, and in that way provides further credibility to the ATOPP questionnaire, our study was cross-sectional and was not designed to look at the possible consequences of these attitudes on promotion and implementation of open science practices. Further interventional research is needed to explore the most efficient interventions in increasing positive researchers' attitudes toward open science practices, as well as if those interventions would lead to greater uptake of such practices [68] . Furthermore, with the recent changes in the EU funding schemes for the period of 2021 to 2027, and the requirement for open peer review and data sharing [69] ; announcement of the journal eLife for only accepting submissions if they have been posted as preprints [70] , as well as dedicated calls for research into ways to increase open sciences practices of those who have not embraced them yet [71] it will be interesting to compare if approaches aimed at rewarding open science practices vs mandating of those practices by several key stakeholders, will have a different impact on researchers attitudes. And, ultimately, which of those approaches will be more effective in inducing changes in the wider scholarly community.",

Further studies are needed to assess attitudes of researchers on these topics in other countries, as well as to track changes of these attitudes over time. With more and more funders and institutions encouraging or mandating open science practices, we believe that validated tools, such as this one, could help assess and monitor researchers' attitudes and their associations with open science practices.

Zha, Li and Yan, in 2013, have measured attitudes of 260 participants from natural and social sciences that previously posted a preprint on a Chinese preprint server [49]. Their questionnaire had 25 questions, with 7 factors (each construct had 2-5 items with Cronbach's alpha values from 0.85 to 0.98 with very high correlations indicating unidimensionality) and they found overall positive attitudes toward preprinting. Yi and Huh [50], investigated attitudes towards preprinting of 365 Korean authors and editors with 5 questions with a reliability of Cronbach \u03b1 = 0.86, but did not report on the construct validity. Overall, they reported positive attitudes of respondents [50].",

Open or blinded\") [51]. Ten years after that, 28% (104 out of 364) of Danish general medical journal reviewers expressed their preference for an open review (answering a single question: \"Which peer review system do you prefer in the future?\") [52].
