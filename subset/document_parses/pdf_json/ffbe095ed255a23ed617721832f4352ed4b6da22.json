Strong associations between trade liberalisation and imported foods, especially ultra-processed foods were evident in measured indicators as follows: (i) food trade with 32 WTO countries showing high levels of import volumes; (ii) a marked increase in 'less healthy' focus food imports namely fatty and other selected meat products, sugar, savoury snacks, ice-cream and edible ices and energy-dense beverages; (iii) actual and bound tariff rates impacting import trends of ice-cream and edible ices, bakery products and confectionary; and in other instances, a sharp increase in import of crisps, snacks and noodles despite tariff rates remaining unchanged from 2008 to 2019; (iv) policies regulating food marketing, composition, labelling and trade in the domestic space with relatively limited safeguard measures; (v) 49 foreign-owned food-related companies involved in food manufacturing and processing and the production of coffee, bakery products, confectionary, food preservatives, fish, local food products and meat, and the manufacturing, processing and packaging of palm oil, coconut oil, cooking oil, water, cordial juice, flavoured juices, soft drinks and alcoholic beverages. These were largely produced for local consumption; (vi) 32 domestic industries engaged in food and beverage production; and (vii) an assessment of WTO provisions relating to domestic policy space and governance showing that the current legal and regulatory environment for food in Vanuatu remains fragmented.",

Its economy relies primarily on agriculture, with the key crops of kava, copra, coffee and cocoa [15] . Despite its rich and lush vegetation with a wide range of fresh fruits and vegetables grown locally, Vanuatu is also a food import dependent nation with an increasing presence of ultra-processed foods [16] . Vanuatu joined the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 2012 as an LDC (least-developed country) and has only recently graduated to its low-and middle-income country (LMIC) status in December 2020. However, when this study was undertaken Vanuatu was still recognised as an LDC. While this study focuses on a review of Vanuatu's commitments under WTO trade agreements only, Vanuatu is also party to several other agreements including the Melanesian Spearhead Group Trade Agreement (MSGTA) which it joined in 2005, the Pacific Agreement on Closer Economic Relations (PACER-Plus) which it joined in 2017 and the Pacific Island Countries' Trade Agreement (PICTA) which it joined in 2001. Due to reduced technical barriers to trade, these trade agreements will all have implications for the availability of ultra-processed foods imported into Vanuatu, making it even more pertinent the need to assess the implications for policy space in Vanuatu to enable it to protect its food environment against these harmful commodities [14, 17] .",

In line with the Pacific NCD roadmap [18] , the Vanuatu NCD Roadmap 2015-2018 calls for national action to reduce premature NCD mortality by 25% by 2025. The four major NCDs, namely cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancers and chronic respiratory diseases, are now responsible for approximately 60% of all premature deaths in Vanuatu [19] . Vanuatu's mortality target is also in line with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) target 3.4 calling for a reduction of premature NCD mortality by a third by 2030 relative to 2015 levels [6, 20] and the World Health Organization NCD global mortality target comprising of a 25% reduction in premature mortality from NCDs by 2025 [21] . The presence of these largely preventable diseases and the magnitude of this disease burden has widespread implications for individuals, families and communities in Vanuatu. Of major concern is the excessive consumption of salt and increased consumption of high fat and trans-fat foods as key contributors to cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.",

For total food import volumes, data were selected by food import categories as defined by the VNSO and the specific Harmonized System (HS) classification codes used to classify these food items.

The food and agriculture related WTO trade agreements were collected from the WTO online database (www.wto.org).

These reflect specific tariff concessions for the goods schedule (General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -GATT), the specified level of market access and national treatment for the services schedule (General Agreement on Trade in Services -GATS), and specific services commitments that Vanuatu has given in the context of trade negotiations. Data on these indicators were analysed using Microsoft Excel and compared with changes in Vanuatu's WTO commitments and domestic regulations in order to shed more light on the impact of trade. There were 32 major WTO trading partner countries exporting food into Vanuatu in 2019. Details of 'other countries' trading with Vanuatu were not segregated, so only major partners are reflected. The decision regarding the years to monitor food import volumes was based on the escalation of imports prior to Vanuatu joining WTO in 2012 and the trend of import volumes after the ratification and sign-off on WTO agreements and their implementation phases.

Drawing on Vanuatu's trade in goods commitments, total food import data is presented to show how trade liberalisation has increased importation of foods which can impact consumption. It can also lead domestic firms in Vanuatu to lower prices if there is increased competition from international imports [26] . Less-healthy food data is also presented to illustrate how Vanuatu's food trade has resulted in an increase in ultra-processed foods. Drawing on Vanuatu's trade in services commitments, data showing the scope and scale of production through FDI and subsequent competition with domestic firms is also presented. This is to illustrate how changes to production can affect consumption of food and beverages via increased FDI in domestic production and intensified local competition [26] . To achieve a healthy food system, regulation across the supply chain is required but binding trade agreements may be constraining policy space for regulatory intervention in a way that hinders the uptake of effective nutrition policy [17] . Vanuatu's WTO commitments and accession package outlined in this section clarify important considerations that can have implications for the design of public health nutrition regulations or policy and Vanuatu's food environment more broadly in relation to international trade law, and in particular, to the principles of non-discrimination, transparency, necessity and justification, dispute processes, harmonisation, market access requirements and quantitative restrictions affecting trade in goods (GATT -General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade)with food being one of the most highly traded goods globally, and trade in services (GATS -General Agreement on Trade in Services).",

On accession to WTO in 2012, Vanuatu bound all its agricultural tariff lines (including food products) at an overall average rate of 43.6%. For non-agricultural products, the WTO decision provides two options: acceding LDCs shall bind 95% of their NAMA (non-agricultural market access) lines at an overall average rate of 35%, or they can undertake more comprehensive binding coverage. Vanuatu agreed to a 100% binding coverage of its NAMA tariff lines at an overall average rate of 39.1%. This decision to apply benchmark ad valorem rates to agricultural and NAMA tariff lines does not, however, prevent LDCs like Vanuatu from negotiating higher rates for sensitive lines, as it does not impose any tariff cap. For instance, Table 4 (see Additional file 1) shows that bound tariff rates for chicken, ice-cream and edible ices, cordials/juices, soft drinks and electrolyte drinks/sports drinks all have tariff peaks that exceed the benchmark. Table 4 also details the variations in tariff rates applied to the selected less healthy foods (shown in Fig. 2) . Tariff rates for these foods remained the same, except for peanut butter, which had a 10% decrease in 2012 and then a 10% increase from 2017; fruit based/flavoured yoghurt, which had a 15% decrease from 2012; and margarine, which had a 10% decrease and tariff reduced to zero from 2017.

An excise duty applies to items such as alcohol and tobacco products and it is now also applied to sugarsweetened beverages. In 2015, a specific excise tax was applied to both imported and locally produced sweetened beverages (HS 2022).

The rising availability of these less healthy products is most greatly associated with foreign direct investment and the progressive liberalisation of Vanuatu's business environment with few restrictions on investment to promote domestic industries and small local businesses.",

            "text": "The analysis presented in this paper suggests that Vanuatu's commitments to WTO Agreements do play an important role in shaping their food environment by increasing both healthy and less healthy imports. Strong associations between trade liberalisation and imported foods, especially ultra-processed foods were evident in the measured indicators. In terms of total food import volume, Vanuatu's food trade with 32 WTO countries has contributed to the high levels of food import volumes. This has also seen a marked increase in 'less healthy' focus food imports namely fatty and other selected meat products, sugar, savoury snacks, ice-cream and edible ices and energy-dense beverages. Vanuatu's binding tariffs has impacted import trends of ice-cream and edible ices, bakery products and confectionary. Although for some food categories such as crisps, snacks and noodles, a sharp increase in the importation of these is evident despite tariff rates remaining unchanged from 2008 to 2019. The encouragement of FDI through Vanuatu's commitments has also increased the availability of locally produced food preparations, processed and ultra-processed foods through its 49 foreign-owned food related companies involved in food manufacturing and processing and the production of coffee, bakery products, confectionary, food preservatives, fish, local food products and meat, and the manufacturing, processing and packaging of palm oil, coconut oil, cooking oil, water, cordial juice, flavoured juices, soft drinks and alcoholic beverages. These were largely produced for local consumption. It has also seen the substantive engagement of 32 domestic industries in food and beverage production.",

            "text": "An assessment of WTO provisions relating to domestic policy space and governance in Vanuatu shows that the current legal and regulatory environment for food in Vanuatu remains fragmented. Trade agreements are increasingly including commitments, usually aimed at harmonising national measures affecting traded goods and this potentially constrains domestic policy making [33] . While major policy changes are needed to create environments that encourage healthy food consumption [17] , the government of Vanuatu remains challenged in this area, as policy processes continue to lack cohesion across multiple sectors and the prioritisation of economic and trade interests above public health [34] . However, there are many principles within Vanuatu's commitments under the WTO agreements that provide opportunity for Vanuatu to enhance policy coherence between trade and health and to strengthen its nutrition policy space. To minimise the risk of incurring challenges under WTO agreements, public health actors and policymakers must understand the accession context and specific clauses of the WTO which can impact policy and ultimately the scope and scale of food production and consumption.",
