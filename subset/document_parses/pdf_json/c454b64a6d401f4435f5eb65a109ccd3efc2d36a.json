Culpability for such threats, while perhaps engaging much of humanity, seems most likely attributable to pro-capitalist individuals (e.g., financiers) and groups (e.g., corporations and transnational trade organizations)-which appear to have relatively successfully influenced most living and nonliving entities to form assemblages (dispositifs) that serve their self-interested ideologies. Given harms associated with such assemblages, it seems clear to many analysts that they need to be severely disrupted or, perhaps, replaced with alliances of entities that are based on ideological perspectives that may contribute to comprehensive wellbeing. Although pro-capitalist assemblages have been extremely resilient, it seems that current sociopolitical instability and, moreover, considerable disruption from the CoViD-19 pandemic may provide unprecedented opportunities for dramatic changes. In this article, after consideration of characteristics and extents of harms linked to fields of science, mathematics and technology/engineering, possibilities are described and critically defended for uses of a particular curriculum and pedagogical framework for helping students to imagine and, perhaps, realize new assemblages of entities that are held together by ideologies that they consider appropriate.",

On the other hand, there are numerous indications that pro-capitalist individuals and groups are ready to return societies to status quo situations, in which few socio-economic and other elite manipulate most other entities on earth for self-interested gains-contributing to such harms as massive wealth disparities, existential threats like climate disruption, species losses and nuclear war, along with ongoing illnesses from manufactured foods and beverages, increasing for-profit surveillance and self-actualization threats through forms of technology-mediated popular entertainment.

Humans enjoy, for instance, extended lifespans through developments in medical and agricultural fields. Nevertheless, it also seems clear that SMT fields often are associated with many threats to wellbeing of individuals, societies and/or environments (WISE). Some prominent climate scientists, for instance, recently published a 'warning to humanity' about severity of harms linked to increases in global average temperatures associated with petroleum uses (Ripple et al., 2020) . Indeed, Ord (2020) includes devastation from climate change, along with nuclear war and species losses, among several existential risks for humanity. Meanwhile, among numerous perhaps less severe but apparently ongoing harms, it seems that humans continue to be plagued by harms like illnesses associated with manufactured foods (Weber, 2009) , pharmaceuticals (Norman et al., 2011) and tobacco (Verma, 2009) .",

Based, for example, on actor-network theory (ANT), an ontological perspective that posits reciprocal relationships among living, non-living and symbolic (semiotic) entities ('actants') (Latour, 2005) , 'blame' may be considered distributed across actor-networks in which SMT fields are embedded. Blame, responsibilities etc. may not, however, be evenly distributed across such material-semiotic networks. Many analysts suggest that humans are particularly influential in dynamics of actor-networks and, accordingly, must accept most blame for many harms to WISE (e.g., Jasanoff, 2015) . Such views have led numerous scientists, social scientists and others to suggest we are currently living through an Anthropocene epoch-with signs of human activities like petroleum-based residues, for instance, captured in geological records (Crutzen & Stoermer, 2010) .",

A better moniker for our current epoch may, therefore, be the Capitalocene (Patel & Moore, 2017) . There are, indeed, many arguments supporting this contention. Power and influences of capitalism appear to have dramatically escalated since about the early 1970s with increasing globalization of neoliberal forms of it. Although definitions vary, neoliberal capitalism, unlike earlier more laisse faire forms, appears to feature concerted efforts by governmentswith assistance from numerous other pro-capitalist entities, including transnational governing organizations (e.g., Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development), think tanks, banks, investors and corporations-to infuse such capitalist ideologies as possessive individualism, competitiveness, externalization of costs/responsibilities and socio-economic stratification into 'essences' (e.g., minds and bodies) of myriad living, nonliving and symbolic entities (actants), including schools, universities, engineers, scientists, consumers, machines and transportation systems (Cahill et al., 2018) . Foucault (1995) discussed influences by neoliberal capitalists in terms of normalizing power, that is, infusion of capitalist ideologies into minds and bodies of myriad entities so that they are considered 'normal' and, indeed, may become part of our subconscious. The resulting network of mostly cooperating living and nonliving actants, which Foucault (2008) called a dispositif, seems capable of assimilating most entities into its networks.",

This can be understood in terms of the schema in Fig. 1 , the original version of which Roth (2001) used to depict reciprocal relationships between science and technology. Assuming 'technology' also involves engineering and that mathematics may be integrated into related processes, this schema may represent 'STEM' (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields-associations that are now commonly promoted in many educational initiatives (Li et al., 2020) .

On the other hand, humans may-to serve certain purposesintentionally mistranslate between World and Sign, creating what I have called ideological gaps.

Externalities can include, for instance, reductions in labour costs (e.g., for wages, benefits and working conditions) and materials (e.g., cheaper ingredients in foods, sometimes lacking in nutritional value). Such reductions can, in turn, lead to numerous compromises to qualities of goods and services that can contribute to many personal, social and environmental harms (like those described above). Exacerbating such compromises appear to have been legal decisions (e.g., in 1980 in the USA) to allow contracts between university-based engineers, scientists etc. and companies/financiers, which tended to further shift university academics' foci from knowledge generation for general wellbeing to those more greatly prioritizing private interests (Krimsky, 2019) .",

An important way to think of this is through actor-network theory, particularly in terms of punctualization, that is, making a network of relations appear reduced to a single entity (Callon, 1991) . For example, large genetically engineered (GE) salmon can be seen as bountiful food sources compared to wild salmon, possibly distracting customers from potentially problematic actants-such as government patents (which can inflate prices, limiting access to such food) and sea lice (which thrive in ocean fish pens, but harm wild and GE salmon) (Pierce, 2013) . Such punctualization, in turn, often is accompanied by deproblematization of SMT/STEM fields (and their supporters), that is, hiding problematic actants from consumers to, in other words, 'sanitize' for-profit products/services. Pro-capitalist ideological techniques like subterfuge described above, along with many others, seem to have concentrated global wealth to unprecedented degrees in what Piketty (2020) calls our hyper-capitalist era. The aid agency Oxfam (2020) suggested, for example, that about 2153 billionaires had roughly the same total wealth as about 4.6 billion people; the richest 1% of the world's population had more combined wealth than 6.9 billion people; and about 50% of humanity 'survive' on little more than $5.50 (USD) per day. It seems clear, therefore, that elite few are reaping benefits largely at expense of considerable personal, social and environmental injustices.",

Questions remain, however, about which socioeconomic systems may contribute to significant increases in social justice and environmental sustainability. Forms of socialism, being antithetical to capitalism, may seem to be reasonable replacements. Proponents of socialism probably should avoid movements towards so-called socialist states like the former USSR, given its highly authoritarian and unjust character (Borgn\u00e4s et al., 2015) . It may be reasonable to strive for more anarchical socialist models, such as libertarian socialism (Chomsky, 1999) . Regarding libertarianism, they would prioritize pro-socialist local decisionmaking by small groups of community members-generally without much (or any) influence from more hierarchical governing entities like central governments. At the same time, in light of significant environmental harms like those described above, there have been numerous calls for more environmentally conscious socialist systems-sometimes called eco-socialism. These would be non-capitalist, prioritizing values like equity, diversity and environmental vitality (Borgn\u00e4s et al., 2015; L\u00f6wy, 2015) .",

Meanwhile, however, promises of RWP leaders and their backers often seem to be ruses-enabling them to further implement pro-capitalist and other programmes (e.g., regarding immigration) that may not have been traditionally acceptable to populations. Such subterfuge seems aligned with conceptions of disaster capitalism (Klein, 2007) , in which leaders exploit public disorientation associated with 'natural' or anthropogenic crises, tacitly or explicitly declaring states of exception (Agamben, 2005) , to justify implementation of policies and practices that would, under pre-crisis circumstances, be unacceptable because of associated social injustices and/or environmental devastation. In this vein, it has been suggested that elected officials often have much less power-and, indeed, are beholden to a 'deep state' of power-brokers, like corporations and their lobbyists, who operate behind the scenes of political decision-making (Lofgren, 2016) .",

Shortly after declaration of a pandemic in March 2020, governments with diverse political leanings instituted policies and practices that may have seemed unimaginable in years preceding the pandemic (Baker, 2020) . Suddenly, money was available for such socialism-like supports as health care, albeit mostly for infected individuals; unemployment benefits for laid-off workers, unemployed students and small companies; income tax payment postponements; rent payment deferrals; and research and development relating to the pandemic. At the same time, there were suggestions of numerous environmental changes that might only be imagined with severely restrained capitalist activities, including reduced greenhouse gas emissions because of diminished petroleum uses by many industries and commercial aviation (UN, 2020) . Community members also have rallied to voluntarily help those in need and produced artistic forms of community spirit-which have often occurred in times of crisis (Solnit, 2009 ), but seem antithetical to neoliberalism-informed, 'winner-take-all,' zeitgeists. In this vein, moreover, cultures (e.g., South Korea) that had many successes in addressing the pandemic arguably tended to have previously implemented some eco-socialist policies and practices, including for health care and pandemic preparedness, while countries with hyper-capitalist regimes (Brazil, UK and USA) tended to struggle with the pandemic (Davis, 2020) .",

She adds (Jasanoff & Kim, 2009) , moreover, that such co-production tends to be largely governed by particular sociotechnical imaginaries-which she and Kim (2009) define as 'collectively held, institutionally stabilized and publicly performed visions of desirable futures, animated by shared understandings of forms of social life and social order attainable through, and supportive of, advances in science and technology' (p. 4; italics added).

They seem doubtful, for instance, given influences of the so-called Global Education Reform Movement (GERM)-a 'viral-like' movement that appears to globally prioritize well-defined educational standards and narrow (often pro-capitalist) subject matter foci (Sahlberg, 2011) . In this vein, it is apparent that many STEM education initiatives, in their fervor for supporting global economic competitions, appear to overly emphasize teaching and learning of knowledge and skills claimed to be useful for production and marketing of for-profit goods and services, often sacrificing students' education about broader-sometimes problematic-relationships among fields of science and technology and societies and environments (Hoeg & Bencze, 2017) . On the other hand, different science education schema-including regarding socially acute questions, socioscientific issues and STSE (science, technology, society, environment) relationships (Bencze et al., 2020b )-have been developed and field-tested over the last several decades that may be suitable for engaging students in re-visioning assemblages of actants held together, more or less, by new ideological perspectives. Such schema may be called 'Science-in-Context' (SinC) approaches, to distinguish them from more reductionist-pro-capitalist-practices that emphasize teaching and learning of widely accepted laws, theories, inventions/innovations, procedures etc. of science and technology, often with minimal references to broader societal relationships. SinC approaches appear to help students to, at least, conceive of SMT/STEM fields as embedded in and, especially, co-determinant with societies (Jasanoff, 2015) .",

Such personal-choice approaches seem important, such as when voting for politicians in representative democracies. On the other hand, confining students to personal choices regarding controversies-regardless of sophistication of underlying argumentation-may limit efforts to overcome many serious harms for wellbeing of individuals, societies and environments associated with SMT/STEM fields. Indeed, foci on controversies apparently have been used by private sector interests to promote public doubts about possibly harmful effects-often regarding science findings-of for-profit commodities, thus, possibly dissuading citizens from acting to overcome possible harms (Oreskes & Conway, 2010).",

However, few such schema appear to have emphasized-as advocated above-efforts to encourage students' re-visioning of ideologies that may enable assemblage of diverse living and nonliving actants into dispositifs that may represent their ideal futures. Key features, however, of the 'STEPWISE' curriculum and pedagogical framework (Bencze, 2017) that I have been using-often in collaboration with graduate students and teachers-as a basis of action research in different educational settings since 2006 show promise in this regard.

Based on constructivist learning theory (Osborne & Wittrock, 1985) , it begins with students reflecting on and expressing their pre-instructional attitudes, skills and knowledge ('ASK')-often regarding different for-profit products and services (e.g., cell phones). Such reflections are intended to be mostly student-directed (albeit with the teacher establishing contexts for reflection) and highly open-ended (with multiple possible conclusions) (Lock, 1990) , thus encouraging students to freely express their pre-instructional ASK. In doing so, they may, perhaps tacitly, express ideological positions that underlie their conceptions of current 'normalized' states of being (Foucault, 1995) . In responding to relatively divergent questions like, 'What do you like and dislike about this item [commodity] and for what reasons?,' 'What individuals and/or groups would agree or disagree with you, and for what reasons?' and 'What do you suggest should be done about harms you believe are linked to this item?,' students' stated conceptions tend to vary, but many or most are relatively reductionist and deproblematized-indicated by their claims, for example, that cell phones are widely appreciated, but expensive and often 'needing' replacement when new features are advertised.",

Given subterfuge apparently employed, as described above, by capitalists to portray processes and products of SMT/STEM in punctualized/de-problematized ways, it is apparent that many, if not all, students need teachers to directly teach ASK that they might struggle to discover on their own. Such discovery, indeed, appears to be particularly problematic in SMT/STEM education initiatives-which, for many decades and, apparently, more intensely in recent years, have promoted inquiry-based learning (IBL) approaches. Although such practices vary, it is apparent that they often tend to place students in contexts in which they are expected to discover-albeit perhaps with 'scaffolding' (teacher interventions)-widely accepted laws, theories and inventions of SMT/STEM fields (Bencze & Alsop, 2009) . For example, it has been described by Schwartz, Lederman and Crawford (2004) , who are prominent IBL advocates, as follows: 'Within a classroom, scientific inquiry involves student-centered projects, with students actively engaged in inquiry processes and meaning construction, with teacher guidance, to achieve meaningful understanding of scientifically accepted ideas targeted by the curriculum' (p. 612).",

Theories involve abstract ideas which cannot be physically illustrated' (p. 7, italics in original). Similarly, experiences are unlikely to naturally reveal ideologies. Consequently, IBL practices meant to enable students to discover mainstream laws and theories (and effective methodologies) can be discriminatorycontributing to apparent ideological orientations envisaging school science/STEM education as a neoliberal-friendly sorting mechanism to identify and educate small cohorts of potential knowledge producers who may eventually help to govern thoughts and actions of most other citizens, many of whom may be considered knowledge consumers, mainly prepared to unquestioningly follow labour instructions from knowledge producers and enthusiastically and repeatedly purchase for-profit goods and services (Giroux & Giroux, 2006) . Such a hierarchical goal is evident, for instance, in some (although not all) statements sanctioning the most recent (and influential) US national science curriculum:",

Drawing on work of Pierce (2013), for instance (as described above), students may be taught about actor-network theory as a way to depunctualize phenomena like genetically engineered salmon to enlighten students about larger networks to which such innovations are embedded and, based on Foucault's (2008) concept of dispositifs, that actants within such networks often are assembled to serve ideological perspectives of powerful entities (e.g., corporations). Effectiveness in helping students to develop new ideological perspectives regarding ontologies, epistemologies and methodologies associated with SMT/STEM fields may be evident, for example, in the complex network map (visible at tinyurl.com/y34982nv) prepared by a tenth-grade student about relationships involving chocolate (Nagi, 2018) and in the in-class discussion involving a student investigating shampoo, viewable online at tinyurl.com/y23m6kgb.",

Having declared such a position, I-and, perhaps, others-do not, however, want to be guilty of oppression by encouraging imposition on educators, students and others of my/our ideological perspectives about, individuals, societies and environments. On the one hand, given hegemony of procapitalist ideologies, it may seem reasonable to provide counter positions through generally state-funded institutions like public education. Moreover, there are precedents for at least dreaming of and publicly discussing 'utopic' worlds (Bregman, 2017 )-such as elimination of female voting restrictions and slavery-before they became more fully enacted. Some of us envisage, for instance, replacing conceptions of our species as Homo aeconomicus (highly rational, self-interested, individuals) with generalized assumptions around mutual human care (Lent, 2017) and care for key elements of global environmental sustainability, such as reductions in greenhouse gas concentrations, habitat exploitation/destruction and biodiversity losses (Raworth, 2017) .",

In early such efforts, as reflected in accounts of students' projects in Bencze and Alsop (2014) and the first school-based issue of JASTE (tinyurl.com/y9axcbou), most actions in them were relatively local and educational-such as by providing class members with slideshow presentations, placing posters in school hallways and, most commonly, contributing to different 'friends-focused' social media outlets (e.g., Facebook\u2122). In terms of rallying diverse actants to form dispositifs in support of causes (e.g., fair labour practices associated with different commodities), such approaches mostly were analogous to 'shotgun' blasts-dependent, to a great extent, on which actants happened to interact with the communications. As we introduced abstract concepts, such as actor-network theory and dispositifs, that may help students to envisage entities like commodities as part of dynamic assemblages of actants held together by particular ideological perspectives, however, students' discourses tended to shift towards more targeted and networked actions.

In the USA, for instance, such measures appear to have at least included sidelining independent science advice, leaving key science positions vacant, revoking science-based safeguards, misrepresenting climate science and rolling back climate change safeguards, weakening science-based pollution standards without scientific justification, undermining protections from hazards at work and home, altering scientific content on federal websites, reducing public access to data, and creating a hostile environment for scientific staff (Carter et al., 2017) . Although election of a Democratic government in the USA may lead to reversal of some of these policies, doubts remain in light of suggestions that government changes do not, necessarily, disrupt influences of the 'deep state', including, especially, very rich financiers and corporations (Lofgren, 2016) .",

Having said that, lest proponents of such interventions be guilty of oppression, they must always work to engage multiple and diverse 'stakeholders' (e.g., governments, community members, company executives, workers, educators) in critical reflective practices (praxis) (McLaren, 2000) that may lead to uncertain and potentially unsatisfying (to them) results.",
