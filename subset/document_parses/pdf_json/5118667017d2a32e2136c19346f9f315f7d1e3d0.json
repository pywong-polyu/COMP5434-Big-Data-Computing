While a growing body of research examined hostile ageism during the pandemic, benevolent ageism received less attention. Drawing on the stereotype content theory and the classic tripartite model of attitudes, the current study explored how benevolent and hostile ageism are reflected in the cognitive, affective, and behavioural dimensions of attitudes towards older adults in German COVID-19 related tweets. The study examined the most prevalent attitudes as well as changes in prevalence between the first and second lockdown period in Germany.",

Researchers stressed the urgency of emphasising heterogeneity in old age and avoiding a public discourse that equates old age with being in a risk group (Ehni & Wahl, 2020; Harper, 2020) . As stated by Ehni and Wahl (2020) , the subgroup of older adults who are particularly vulnerable to COVID-19 due to pre-existing health conditions and significant multimorbidity only represent approximatively 20% of people above 65 years of age. Also, only 4% of people above 65 live in elder care facilities, which have been particularly affected by the virus. These findings are compatible with studies suggesting that developmental diversity increases as people age and that heterogeneity (e.g. psychological, social and health related aspects) is the highest among older individuals (Pachana, 2016) . It is, therefore, of significant concern that the public discourse on COVID-19 included stereotypical representations of older adults as a homogenous group characterized by frailty, illness, and helplessness (Ayalon et al., 2021) .",

Moreover, social media users show a preference for information that confirms previous beliefs (Del Vicario et al., 2016) , and polarising content has been found to gain more popularity and stimulate greater activity (Shore et al., 2018) . The association between social media usage and ingroup polarisation may explain why mass media has been found to promote opposing and contradictory views on ageing, thereby intensifying both positive and negative age stereotypes (Clarke, 2009; Clarke et al., 2014 Craciun, 2019 . Levy et al. (2014) argue that negative age stereotypes might be particularly prevalent on social media.

Germany is one of the most drastically changing EU states in terms of its age demographics (Eissel, 2021) and one of the top-twenty countries worldwide in terms of the gross number of cases or deaths related to COVID-19 (World Health Organization, 2021a) . Furthermore, Germany has robust policies in place that recognise the need to counter ageism e.g. by recognising older individuals as a resource, rather than a burden (Craciun, 2019; Tesch-R\u00f6mer & Wurm, 2012) . Finally, German COVID-19 policies, compared to those of neighbouring countries, relied on social responsibility and compliance rather than strictly controlled curfews, and policymakers asked citizens to show solidarity and personal responsibility by complying with restrictions (Zimmermann et al., 2021) . Therefore, Germany serves as a solid case study for studying potential benevolent ageist responses to such government policies.",

This procedure allows for a pre-definition of relevant material-sections, similar with the inductive-dominant approach by Sipocz et al. (2021) . First, both authors separately read through the entire material. Following this initial step, the first author analysed the material tweet by tweet. Subthemes were paraphrased directly from the tweets, meaning that the subtheme-categories came from the material itself, hence inductive (Mayring, 2014) . The subthemes were constructed as a term or short sentence that gave a precise characterisation of the tweet's main theme (Mayring, 2014) . For example, the tweet \"All these restrictions on #COVID19? OK. Must be. What annoys me the most? About 90% of the people I see without a mask are people older than 65 years... WHAT'S WRONG WITH THEM ????\" was summarized as containing the subtheme \"older adults being irresponsible in relation to A c c e p t e d M a n u s c r i p t 10 In accordance with the procedure of inductive category assignment, once the first author had constructed the first subtheme, the subtheme of each new tweet was compared with the previously coded subthemes, following a reductive approach (Mayring, 2014) . If a new tweet was compatible with a previously constructed subtheme, it was either included into the pre-existing subtheme, or the subthemes were combined and reformulated to better encompass all aspects of the tweets. If no compatible subtheme was found, a new subtheme was constructed. After coding 250 tweets -that is approximately 30% of the overall dataset -saturation was achieved at 21",

However, on Twitter a single tweet can be more or less visible depending on how many people see and share the tweet. This means that a less frequent subtheme can reach a larger audience than a more frequently posted one, thereby being more prevalent. This phenomenon was accounted for by calculating a proxy variable for the reach of a specific category, that is, by aggregating the sum of likes, comments and retweets across all tweets and then summarising the values for each subtheme.

One subtheme was categorised as hostile, since it criticised vaccination strategies due to a devaluation of older people, saying that the sacrifice is not worth it \"just\" to protect older individuals and that these older individuals steal resources from younger ones. There were four benevolent ageist subthemes which over-emphasised chronological age as a singular risk factor. For two subthemes, this over-emphasis was reflected in a promotion of selective vaccination or lockdowns for older adults e.g. criticising lockdowns on and vaccinations for younger adults as \"exaggerated\". The other two subthemes emphasised a need for protective behaviours towards older people and criticised younger individuals for putting older people at risk by behaving irresponsibly. The two non-/anti-ageist subthemes included criticising the concept of selective lockdown (i.e. only isolating older adults) or criticising a vaccination strategy that over-emphasises age.

Older adults were portrayed as a uniformly vulnerable group, who, due to their fragility, and an inability to care for themselves, require support and protection and are neglected by society.

Only one single subtheme focused on heterogeneity in relation to older people (i.e. heterogeneously vulnerable), and only two tweets out of the entire sample contained this subtheme. Furthermore, the category victims of neglect, which displayed a highly homogeneous view of older adults, was one of the most prevalent subthemes, both in terms of frequency and in terms of reach. Certainly, it is important to address the potential shortcomings in terms of protecting vulnerable individuals and fostering greater awareness of inadequate resources in elder care. Nonetheless, is it equally important to avoid promoting a benevolent and condescending discourse and to emphasize that not all older adults live in elder care or belong to a highly at-risk group. The uniform portrayal of older adults as being \"left in elder care\" might promote overgeneralised and benevolent ageist attitudes towards older adults and ageing (i.e. all older adults belong to a homogenous, highly vulnerable group).",

For example, feelings of solidarity and universally vulnerable (working against an over-emphasis of chronological age as a risk factor) can be seen as clear oppositional attitudes to those within the two subthemes protection and victims of neglect. Similarly, both devaluation and opposing devaluation were some of the most frequently occurring subthemes. This lends support to previous research that showed that emotional and polarising content tends to have greater social influence on social media (Chung & Zeng, 2018; Shore et al., 2018) . Additionally, it endorses the idea that social media might have a polarising effect on people's attitudes towards older individuals as well as enhance pre-existing negative age stereotypes. This is important, since social media has played a crucial role in information-sharing and -consumption, during the pandemic, potentially having a large effect on the public discourse during this time.",

It is intuitively sensible that the vaccination related subthemes would become more frequent in the second measurement period, as vaccines began to be distributed. Nonetheless, other less self-explanatory changes in prevalence were identified. Interestingly, the subthemes protection and harmful behaviour of young became significantly less frequent, while the subtheme victims of neglect, COVID related became significantly more frequent in the second measurement period. This suggests that while the first period of lockdown policies was characterised more by a promotion of behaviours aiming at protecting older individuals (i.e. calling for people to follow restrictions and for young people not to be irresponsible), the second lockdown period described the actions being taken in the first period as inadequate, criticizing the neglect of older people. These findings are important, as they suggest that a somewhat positive wish to protect older individuals was prevalent among the tweets. This desire, nonetheless, is problematic in terms of equating age alone with greater risk from COVID-19, thereby stigmatising older people as a uniformly and homogeneously vulnerable group. Additionally, these findings support the idea that a \"caremongering\" phenomenon can be seen as a response to protective measures, public communicated risk factors, and perceived insufficient government policies (Vervaecke & Meisner, 2021 Although the study was undertaken in a German context, these findings are likely transferable to other countries relying on the formulation of chronological age as a risk factor within their COVID-19 related policies and especially those more dependent on social responsibility and compliance. Findings emphasise a general need to create awareness about negative outcomes of benevolent ageism and the close link between formulations, framing, and implementations of specific policies and ageist related outcomes. Future studies could benefit from comparing these findings with other countries to identify links between specific policy-strategies and ageist outcomes. Finally, this paper illustrates the relevance of social media platforms like Twitter, to researchers and policy makers who wish to combat COVID-19 related ageism, since its content reflects the attitudes of individuals responding to COVID-19. Furthermore, Twitter has the potential to perpetuate and shape ageist attitudes, due to its status as a key information source for many people during the pandemic.",

While the danger of hostile ageism might be more obvious, it is equally relevant to stress the potentially negative outcomes of benevolent ageism during COVID-19. The latter may reflect a desire to help and support but also contributes to perpetuating negative ageing stereotypes. The nature of COVID-19 vulnerability is rather complex, with multiple factors contributing to an individual belonging to a risk group. Thus, using chronological age as an over-simplified factor when defining a COVID-19 risk group is problematic because it might become common sense knowledge and contribute to an increased consensus surrounding the homogenous vulnerability of older adults (i.e. negative stereotypes about older adults). Furthermore, the reliance on chronological age combined with an emphasis on social responsibility, might trigger care-oriented yet benevolent reactions (Vervaecke & Meisner, 2021) . In line with the propositions formulated by Ehni and Wahl (2020) , these findings suggest that policy makers should be cautious when using age as a decisive factor in COVID-19 related policies (e.g.",

The final hostile cognitive subtheme ascribed more unspecific, diffuse negative characteristics to older adults (with no direct link to. The three more benevolent subthemes contained stereotypes of older individuals as being vulnerable (either in relation to COVID-19 or generally), lonely, or victims of neglect (either in relation to COVID-19 or generally). In contrast, only three nonor anti-ageist cognitive subthemes were identified. Two of these subthemes describe older adults as not being the only group vulnerable to COVID-19 (with the focus on a universal vulnerability to the virus) or being heterogeneous in their vulnerability, thereby contrasting the benevolent emphasis of chronological age as an oversimplified risk factor. The final anti-ageist subtheme described older adults as being a resource to society in terms of, for example, having contributed to the current standard of living.The affective dimension contained subthemes expressing affective responses to older adults in relation to COVID-19 and contained two hostile ageist and two non-/anti-ageist subthemes. The hostile affective subthemes comprised a sensation of indifference or hostility towards older adults dying of COVID-19 (resulting in devaluation of their death) as well as the sensation of being irritated when interacting with older adults. The non-or anti-ageist affective subthemes expressed either a negative emotional response to people devaluing the COVID-19 related deaths of older adults (i.e. an opposition to the devaluation) or a feeling of intergenerational solidarity in relation to the pandemic.",

Furthermore, the findings suggest a strong polarising effect of social media concerning COVID-19 and ageing, since opposing attitudes were identified among the most prevalent subthemes. Specifically, benevolent ageist calls for protecting older adults can be seen as polarised in opposition to the hostile devaluation of older adults' lives. Finally, when looking at the results of the time series analysis, it becomes apparent that many tweets moved from expressing various attitudes towards specific measures to evaluating the effectiveness of those measures. This highlights the close link between the subthemes and specific COVID-19 related measures taken in Germany, for example social distancing measures relying on social compliance(Zimmermann et al., 2021).",
