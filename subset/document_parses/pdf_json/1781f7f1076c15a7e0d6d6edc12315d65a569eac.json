Sobre la base de las investigaciones y experiencias nacionales existentes en estos pa\u00edses, proponemos cinco lecciones aprendidas: 1. No hay evidencia de una pandemia de salud mental hasta el momento en los pa\u00edses en estudio. No se observa un aumento de los trastornos mentales severos, pero s\u00ed un aumento de los s\u00edntomas de los trastornos de salud mental comunes. Se necesitan m\u00e1s estudios longitudinales de alta calidad para entender la carga de salud mental de la pandemia; 2. La pandemia afecta a los pa\u00edses (incluida la situaci\u00f3n de salud mental) en forma diferente seg\u00fan el nivel de exposici\u00f3n, las pol\u00edticas de gesti\u00f3n, las caracter\u00edsticas estructurales previas a la pandemia y los recursos de atenci\u00f3n en salud; 3. La pandemia afecta a las personas de distintas maneras: la severidad de exposici\u00f3n a los estresores relacionados con la pandemia difiere entre las personas, as\u00ed como los recursos individuales para hacer frente a estos factores estresantes. Hay ganadores y perdedores as\u00ed como grupos de riesgo identificables que necesitan atenci\u00f3n especial; 4. Adem\u00e1s de las consecuencias negativas, la pandemia ha tenido un impacto positivo. Las innovaciones aplicadas r\u00e1pidamente dentro del sistema de respuestas de atenci\u00f3n de la salud son una ventana de oportunidad para cambios positivos en las pol\u00edticas, estrategias y pr\u00e1cticas de atenci\u00f3n de la salud mental. El aumento del enfoque en la salud mental durante la pandemia puede contribuir a la priorizaci\u00f3n de problemas de salud mental en los niveles organizacionales y de formulaci\u00f3n de pol\u00edticas y podr\u00eda reducir el estigma; 5. Se requieren respuestas frente a la COVID-19 informadas en estr\u00e9s y en trauma. La comunidad europea de psicotraumat\u00f3logos, bajo el liderazgo de la ESTSS, juega un papel importante en la promoci\u00f3n de la atenci\u00f3n en salud informada en estr\u00e9s y trauma y las pol\u00edticas de gesti\u00f3n de pandemias. Basados en las lecciones aprendidas, proponemos un modelo de salud mental p\u00fablica de atenci\u00f3n escalonada para la prevenci\u00f3n de las consecuencias adversas de salud mental durante las pandemias.",

More than 2 years have passed since the beginning of the COVID-19 crisis and a large number of studies have explored the corresponding mental health burden in Europe and worldwide.

According to the findings of the ESTSS pan-European ADJUST study, out of the 11 countries participating in the study, Georgia and another Eastern European country (Lithuania) are experiencing the highest level of adjustment disorder symptoms (Lotzin, Krause, et al., 2021) .

There is an increased demand for professional burnout prevention interventions from financially stable organizations (banks, insurance companies, etc.). A rise in demand for counselling is also observable in 2020 and 2021 in the student counselling services (Makhashvili & Javakhishvili, 2021) . According to expert opinion, these may contribute to a reduction in mental health-related stigma in Georgia. The Georgian Society of Psychotrauma and a number of mental healthcare non-governmental organizations, with the support of international donors, organized crisis intervention services, setting up a hotline and online crisis counselling service to fill the existing service gaps in the country.",

In an online survey, 65.2% reported psychological distress and 59% reported COVID-19-related fear (B\u00e4uerle et al., 2020a) . Women and younger individuals reported higher levels of distress (B\u00e4uerle et al., 2020b) . Most of the conducted studies used convenience samples that overrepresented highly educated female individuals with access to the internet, which complicates the generalization of the findings to the general German population. One population-based cohort study during the early phase of the pandemic found that symptoms of depression and anxiety increased, compared to the year before the pandemic, but only in participants under 60 years of age (Peters et al., 2020) . In addition to female gender and younger age, a pre-existing mental disorder was found to be a risk factor for higher levels of distress, anxiety, and depressive symptoms (B\u00e4uerle et al., 2020b; Bendau et al., 2021) . It can be expected that a history of childhood abuse or neglect is another risk factor for an increased level of distress. Survivors of childhood abuse reported that preventive measures such as wearing protection over the mouth and nose reactivated trauma-related feelings such as powerless, helplessness, and limited self-determination; at the same time, some individuals with a history of childhood abuse felt safer than before the pandemic by keeping a distance and reducing physical contact (UKASK, 2020) . In an ongoing international cohort study on symptoms of adjustment disorder (Lotzin, Krause, et al., 2021) , restricted physical and social contacts, restricted leisure activities, work-related problems, and difficult housing conditions were associated with symptoms of adjustment disorders.",

The ESTSS pan-European ADJUST study, which has been implemented in 11 ESTSS member countries, revealed that the level of symptoms of adjustment disorder varied by country, with Georgia and Lithuania showing higher scores for adjustment disorder than the remaining nine countries (Lotzin, Krause, et al., 2021) . These results are in line with the findings of another international study that found increased mental health problems in Latin America compared to other countries (Olff et al., 2021) .",

In particular, health and socioeconomic disparities appear as key factors that contribute to both increased stressor exposure and adverse mental health outcomes. The pandemic not only exposes but also reveals and exacerbates existing vulnerabilities, which are related to differences in the extent and depth of negative mental health consequences. At-risk groups include younger (often female) individuals, individuals who lose their jobs or face financial problems, individuals with a mental disorder or a history of childhood abuse or neglect, and healthcare workers.",

Moving to the virtual mode of service provision and rapid development of ehealth interventions, accompanied by efficacy studies, may contribute towards improving mental health services and increasing service accessibility in the long term; this conclusion is in line with what many mental health experts and service users think in this regard (Moreno et al., 2020) .

Even more should be done to ensure that the newly accumulated evidence informs pandemic management policies in a timely manner. The academic journals create an excellent avenue for professional exchange, but they often do not reach key stakeholders outside academic circles, such as policymakers, problembearers, and the public.
