This process can be used by a computer-aided methodology to improve accuracy. In this study, a new and optimal method has been utilized for the diagnosis of COVID-19. Here, a method based on fuzzy C-ordered means (FCOM) along with an improved version of the enhanced capsule network (ECN) has been proposed for this purpose. The proposed ECN method is improved based on mayfly optimization (MFO) algorithm. The suggested technique is then implemented on the chest X-ray COVID-19 images from publicly available datasets. Simulation results are assessed by considering a comparison with some state-of-the-art methods, including FOMPA, MID, and 4S-DT. The results show that the proposed method with 97.08% accuracy and 97.29% precision provides the highest accuracy and reliability compared with the other studied methods. Moreover, the results show that the proposed method with a 97.1% sensitivity rate has the highest ratio. And finally, the proposed method with a 97.47% F1-score rate gives the uppermost value compared to the others.",

Therefore, they should quarantine themselves, receive medical treatment, and inform and warn their relatives. One of the most popular and less harmful imaging methods for diagnosis of this area is chest X-ray imaging. Chest X-ray images are images that use small doses of ionizing radiation to take pictures of the inside of the body called radiographs [3] . The X-rays can help physicians in different cases such as bone fractures, dislocations, or joint inflammation, abdominal pain, and also some cancer cases [4] .

One of these changes is called data conversion. Data conversion is a mathematical method used to modify variables that do not follow the statistical assumptions of normality, linearity, and uniform scattering, or have patterns with unusual outliers. Among data conversion methods, data normalization has high efficiency. Normalization has different meanings in statistics, the simplest use of which is to normalize data or normalize variables, and is a method that puts data in the same domain when they are not [11] . In other words, a data miner may encounter situations where the properties of the data include values that are in different ranges or domains. These large-value features may have a much greater effect on the cost function than low-value features. This problem will be solved by normalizing the properties so that their values are in the same range [12] . In constructing a metamodel from the data, before model training begins, the data is subdivided into its largest corresponding values to be normalized to values between zero and one scales, to minimize the effect of the absolute scale and have almost all inputs in the same range.",

In the present study, contrast enhancement has been used on COVID-19 chest X-ray images to highlight the significant areas with keeping the other areas fixed.

However, this insect needs almost one year to birth; it dies after a maximum of 1 day of living. The main target of their birthing is mating. Most of them even do not bother themselves with feeding. The mayfly swarms for mating usually include several males from a few to hundreds of individuals, which are about 1 m to 4 m above the ground for about 1.5 hours to 2 hours in the early morning. Formatting and grabbing the females, males do some nuptial dance over a characteristic up-and-down pattern of movement. Afterward, the couples were released to the vegetation for mating. The mayfly optimization algorithm uses this conception for optimization [16] . This algorithm uses a hybrid conception of the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the genetic algorithm (GA), and the firefly algorithm (FA). Based on the MFO algorithm, the initial population is divided into two classes of male and female mayflies that are generated randomly. The initial population (candidates) is considered a d-dimensional vector X = \u00bdx 1 , x 2 , \u22ef, x d T which has been randomly positioned in the solution space. The mayflies have a velocity equal to V = \u00bdv 1 , v 2 , \u22ef, v d T , and their direction relates to both social and individual flying experiences. Then, the candidates tune their position close to their best position (p best ), as well as the best position of the other candidates (g best ).",

Early diagnosis of COVID-19 can be so beneficial to the treatment of the disease and to prevent its outbreak. Due to the probability of human error among the experts in finding COVID-19, the application of 9 BioMed Research International machine learning has been recently increased as an auxiliary tool. The present study proposed a method based on image processing for the diagnosis of COVID-19. This study presented an optimal configuration for proper diagnosis of COVID-19 based on an optimized fuzzy C-ordered means (FCOM) and an improved version of the enhanced capsule network (ECN). The ECN was improved based on the mayfly optimization (MFO) algorithm. The proposed method was then performed on the chest X-ray COVID-19 images from publicly available datasets. The results were analyzed by comparing some other methods, including FOMPA, MID, and 4S-DT, and the results showed the higher effectiveness of the proposed method. As mentioned, the proposed method has good accuracy in terms of theory. However, due to using complicated methods, using it in real-time applications is not feasible. Therefore, in future work, we will work on using a simplified technique of the proposed method to perform on a microprocessor for realtime applications.",
