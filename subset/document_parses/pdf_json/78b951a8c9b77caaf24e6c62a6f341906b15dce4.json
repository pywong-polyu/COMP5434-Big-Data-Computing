Neutrophil engraftment, relapse rate, nonrelapse mortality, GVHD survival, and overall survival were comparable to double unit UCB transplant. Recipients who had received a double unit UCB transplant had a trend toward increased grade II to IV acute GVHD by univariate analysis. 6 Cell dose per kilogram body weight should determine whether or not an adult recipient should receive one UCB unit or two for UCB transplant as there is no difference in engraftment, relapse, nonrelapse mortality, or overall survival. 3 American community since only 19% will have a fully matched 8/8 unrelated donor. 2 However, more recently the degree of allelic mismatch at HLA-A, HLA-C, or HLA-DR has been associated with a higher risk of transplant-related mortality (TRM). 9 In a retrospective study of single unit UCB transplant by Eapen et al, grades II to IV acute GVHD were associated with allelic mismatch. Relapse and overall mortality were similar unless mismatched at 4 and 5 alleles, respectively. 10 Choosing UCB units with fewer allelic mismatches for transplant may decrease TRM and acute GVHD. 9,10",

When Zhang et al compared UCB CIK cells to CIK cells derived from peripheral blood, UCB derived CIK had higher proliferation rates and a higher number of CD3+CD56+ cells. In a mouse model, the UCB CIK cells had more tumor growth inhibition. 54 UCB CIK cells have activity against B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell lines and their activity was increased by interferon-\u03b1 in a mouse model. 55 UCB CIK cells were given to five patients with relapsed leukemia after UCB transplant, the CIK cells were well tolerated, and one patient had a partial response. 56 When UCB CIK cells were combined with second line chemotherapy in solid malignancies in a clinical trial, those patients who had received the UCB CIK cells had longer progression-free survival and overall survival compared to chemotherapy only. 57 UCB derived CIK cells may have cytotoxic activity for both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors alone and in combination with chemotherapy. 56,57 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are an exciting new therapy for the treatment of acute lymphoblastic leukemia and diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. The use of CAR T-cells is limited by significant toxicities including cytokine release syndrome and immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity. Using natural killer (NK) cells for CAR therapy may reduce these side effects while preserving the cytotoxic efficacy toward tumor cells. 58,59 CAR-NK cells from UCB have been found to be easier to stimulate with higher expansion rates than adult NK cells. 60 Interestingly, the group from McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario evaluated the ability to isolate and ex vivo expand NK cells from cryopreserved UCB. NK cells were expanded from fresh UCB, cryopreserved units <1 year old, and longer-term cryopreserved units from 1 to 10 years. In their research, it was possible to obtain and expand UCB-NK cells from even the long-term cryopreserved units. The expanded NK cells had surface expression of activating markers, had a potent antitumor function, and produced high levels of proinflammatory interferon-\u03b3 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. The expanded NK cells had cytotoxic activity toward breast cancer cells. 59 Liu et al have evaluated UCB NK cells, transduced with a retroviral vector to target specific markers, including CD19, IL-15, and caspase-9 based suicide gene, in targeting non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia in 11 patients. NK cells were cytotoxic, killingtumor cells without the side effect of GVHD, cytokine release syndrome, or neurotoxicity seen with allogeneic T cells. CAR-NK cells were easily producible, had prolonged survival, and were efficacious toward selected targets.58 UCB may be a source for allogeneic CAR-NK cells for tumor cytotoxicity without the side effects see with CAR T-cell therapy.[58][59][60]",

Neutrophil engraftment was faster by 9 days in the cocultured group.27 A second study from MD Anderson Cancer Center evaluated UCB cocultured with mesenchymal precursor cells and outcomes compared to unmanipulated UCB units in reduced intensity hematopoietic cell transplant. Similar results were seen in neutrophil engraftment occurring at day 12 in the cocultured UCB transplant recipients and 16 days in the unmanipulated UCB transplant group.28 Delaney et al developed a notch-mediated ex vivo UCB expansion process to increase the number of CD34 cells by 100-fold. When these cells were transplanted with an unmanipulated UCB unit in a phase I trial, rapid engraftment was achieved at a median of 16 days compared to 26 days.29 In the phase I nicotinamide expansion study of 11 patients, UCBproducts were expanded for 21 days with nicotinamide and a T-cell fraction to determine if this process can improve engraftment and shorten count recovery. Recipients of the expanded UCB units had shorter time to neutrophil engraftment compared to historical controls, 13 days vs 25 days. The nicotinamide expanded UCB units were Abbreviations: DPP-4, dipeptidyl peptidase-IV; UCB, umbilical cord blood. not associated with any adverse events in the phase I trial. 30 Nicotinamide expanded single unit UCB transplant was evaluated in a phase I/II clinical trial in 36 patients with hematologic malignancies. 31 Neutrophil recovery was a median 11.5 days in the expanded UCB group compared to 21 days. Fewer bacterial infections and shorter hospital length of stay were seen in the first 100 days after the expanded UCB II study by the University of Montreal in adult patients with hematologic malignancies.

Use of the trols. 41 A phase I study evaluated the role of the safety and efficacy of prostaglandin E2 on ex vivo modulation to improve hematopoietic engraftment after double unit UCB transplant. Neutrophil recovery was seen at 17.5 days in the 12 patients in cohort 2 vs 21 days for historical controls. Long-term engraftment of the prostaglandin treated UCB was seen in 10 of 12 recipients. 40 Fifteen patients were enrolled on a clinical trial evaluating hyperbaric oxygen and its effects on erythropoietin levels. Reducing erythropoietin in the UCB recipient potentially enhances homing of UCB to the bone marrow environment. Median time to neutrophil recovery was 14 days and all patients had platelet recovery. 39 In long-term follow-up, overall survival at 6 months was better in patients treated with hyperbaric oxygen; however, there was no difference in overall survival between the treated patients and historical controls at 1 year.all survival was similar between the two groups. In general, the haploidentical graft provides short-term engraftment and then is rejected in favor of the UCB graft. Use of combined grafts for transplant, haploidentical grafts and UCB, may improve time to engraftment, thus reducing morbidity and mortality.45 single unit UCB transplant arm. No difference was seen in relapse, 17% vs 12% for haploidentical transplant and single unit UCB transplant, respectively. Acute and chronic GVHD were similar between the two transplant types by multivariate analysis. Increased nonrelapse mortality, delayed engraftment, reduced overall survival, and decreased leukemia-free survival were seen in the single unit UCB arm.48 donor, matched unrelated donor, and haploidentical grafts. Chronic GVHD occurred less often in the UCB transplant group and relapse rate was similar between the groups. GVHD-free relapse-free survival was lower in patients who had received UCB transplant after day 100.50 When UCB transplant was compared to mismatched unrelated donor transplants in patients with acute lymphoid leukemia, AML, and myelodysplastic syndrome with minimal residual disease using myeloablative conditioning, the incidence of grade III to IV acute GVHD was lower in patients with UCB transplant compared to patients with mismatched unrelated donor transplants. The relapse rate was better for UCB transplant with decreased TRM and improved overall survival. 14 In a study by Tanaka et al, evaluating mismatched unrelated donor transplant and UCB transplant outcomes in patients older than 50 years of age, acute and chronic GVHD was less with UCB; however, both types of transplants had comparable rates of relapse and TRM.15 In pediatric patients with AML, matched sibling",

Patients who had received the UCB injections had improvement in walking as well as bowel and bladder control.68 These early phase clinical trials show the potential for UCB regenerative medicine in neurological conditions. 65-686.2 | CardiologyMesenchymal stem cells derived from UCB were transfected with AKT and injected into rats, which had the left anterior descending artery ligated. Those rats, which received the AKT modified mesenchymal UCB exosomes, had improved cardiac function and had evidences of angiogenesis.69 Additionally, induced pluripotent stem cells, adult stem cells with an inserted transcription factor, can potentially regenerate heart tissue in patients with myocardial infarcts, a leading cause of death in adults.70 Research with UCB in regenerative medicine for cardiac diseases is still developing.UCB remains a viable donor option for hematopoietic cell transplant and is an emerging cellular source for regenerative medicine. Rapid availability, 7 expansion of the donor pool due to low immunogenicity,3,4,8 reduced incidence of chronic GVHD 3 and the potential for reduced incidence of disease relapse in recipients with minimal residual disease 14 are just a few of the advantages of UCB transplant. Delayed engraftment and graft failure, 3,16-18 TRM, 9,19 infection risk, 22-24 and cost of UCB acquisition 25 remain important concerns regarding the use of UCB for transplant. Despite multiple efforts with homing, 39-43,47 ex vivo expansion, 27-37,46 and combined graft sources, 45 no survival benefit has been demonstrated. In addition, many of the current techniques are expensive and only available in specialized centers. When unrelated adult donors are not available due to global procurement issues and/or transportation disruptions like those being experienced now because of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, UCB may regain favor as a transplant graft source. Additionally, UCB remains an important graft source option for patients who do nothave an unrelated donor. Encouraging minority ethnic groups to bank cord blood in public banks is needed to provide graft sources for these underserved ethnic groups.2 Costs of acquisition of UCB will need to decrease and/or improved reimbursement by payors needs to be addressed to make UCB transplant economically feasible.25 In order to improve the sustainability of UCB transplant, continued research on UCB expansion to improve the cell dose of UCB units has to occur. Additional research is needed to evaluate different techniques to improve time to engraftment in UCB transplant.By improving time to engraftment for UCB transplant, subsequent reductions in TRM and infection risk may be seen. In addition, given decreased use of UCB for traditional transplant indications, there are legitimate concerns about the sustainability of UCB banking.Higher nucleated count target levels, contingency planning, and collaboration with private banking or industry have been explored in the Rand Report and are beyond the scope of this review.71 These concerns regarding UCB will need to be addressed through philanthropy, public service, and future clinical trials for UCB to remain a viable option as a graft source for hematopoietic cell transplant.
