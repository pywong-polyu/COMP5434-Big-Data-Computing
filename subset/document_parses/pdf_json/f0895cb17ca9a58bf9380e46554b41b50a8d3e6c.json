Demand for online learning has surged during a period of mass layoffs and transition to remote work and schooling. Can this uptake in online learning help close longstanding skills gaps in the US workforce in a sustainable and equitable manner? We answer this question by analyzing individual engagement data of DataCamp users between October 2019 and September 2020 (n = 277,425). Exploiting the staggered adoption of actions to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 across states, we identify the causal effect at the neighborhood level. The adoption of nonessential business closures led to a 38% increase in new users and a 6% increase in engagement among existing users. We find that these increases are proportional across higher-and lower-income neighborhoods and neighborhoods with a high or low share of Black residents. This demonstrates the potential for online platforms to democratize access to knowledge and skills that are in high demand, which supports job security and facilitates social mobility.",

Since these state policies are driven much more by political affiliation than by the number of local infections or other real factors (16) , we argue that these unobserved shocks are likely uncorrelated with a state's decision to adopt an NBC.

There are serious concerns that online learning disadvantages members of underserved communities, thereby exacerbating social inequalities. However, it is hard to evaluate these concerns at scale partly due to selection effects. Policy responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, such as nonessential business closures, suddenly changed how people spent their time, which allowed us to estimate effects on demand for online learning and how it varies along socioeconomic dimensions. Unlike most prior studies that find education technology to maintain or amplify inequities, we present causal evidence for its potential democratizing effects. engagement among existing users. This suggests that the pandemic brought people to start acquiring programming skills online (intensive margin effect) as well as it encouraged already active learners to study more (extensive margin effect). We observe little variation between lower-and higher-income regions and no variation based on racial composition. All demographic regions experienced a substantial increase in online learning following the adoption of these state policies. This suggests that, at least over the pandemic, the expansion of online learning through Data-Camp has had a \"democratizing\" effect in the market for technical (programming) educational services.",

Tables 1 and 2 present five models for each outcome measure: the number of new user registrations and the number of exercises completed by existing users, respectively. Starting with a raw correlation coefficient with NBC, we progressively add more control variables and fixed effects to the model to mitigate concerns of omitted variables bias.

Finally, we also add state fixed effects to observationally compare online learning interactions before vs. after the adoption of the NBC (column 5).

Although the CIs on these treatment effects are larger and we cannot rule out that the treatment effects are the same within a 95% CI with the exception of the results for high-vs. low-income regions, overall these results suggest that online learning platforms like Data-Camp can be an important tool for facilitating upskilling among workers in lower-skilled areas (SI Appendix, Table S3 has detailed estimates).",

Although we cannot say how much different people benefit from online learning, our results reveal trends among people in different zip codes. As a proxy for individual differences, zip code-level demographics tend to exaggerate trends by combining individual and community characteristics (22) , but these discrepancies are larger for small, rural areas than for large, urban areas (23) . Our sample tends to be from larger urban areas (SI Appendix, Table S1), as DataCamp targets young professionals and university students, thus mitigating zip codebased discrepancies. Prior work showing sociodemographic inequalities in online courses has also been conducted at the zip code level and even national level (5, 6) . Despite the lack of individual-level characteristics, our current findings therefore provide evidence consistent with the idea that online learning can have democratizing effects.

A limitation of not having individual-level demographic data is our inability to speak to gender differences and address engagement among women and parents. Nevertheless, we do demonstrate that regions with higher proportions of individuals aged 25 to 44 have increasingly joined DataCamp and existing users in those regions increased their learning engagement.

These benefits included a small fraction receiving a promotion and about half of the respondents saying that they now have better credentials for future jobs. While Coursera offers a wider variety of courses than DataCamp, the findings are promising and suggest DataCamp users who grew their skills over this time frame could also benefit professionally. This is especially applicable in the context of DataCamp, which serves a user base of firms and technology teams with demand for upskilling their employees.

For others, such as women and parents, this newly found free time was filled with new and greater responsibilities such as homeschooling and child care. While demands on time increased for some, our data suggest that at least a portion of the US population benefited from new found free time and used that time to upskill. Furthermore, it appears that this occurred relatively consistently across regions with varying income, racial, educational, and occupational compositions. These findings suggest an interesting set of interventions for businesses and policy makers to consider. The closure of nonessential businesses acted as a large shock to free time for some individuals; if businesses could increment the time off they give to their employees, they could potentially support individuals in the pursuit of career development goals.

We study the demand for online learning using records from DataCamp (15), one of the fastest-growing online learning platforms for programming and data science courses. The platform offers nearly 400 courses on Python for data science, R programming, SQL databases, and applied finance. The courses are self-paced and interactive. The first \"chapter\" of any course is provided for free, and additional materials are offered for a monthly fee (between US$25 and $33 per person for individual and business plans). DataCamp's user base is composed primarily of professionals who would otherwise be thinking of going back to formal school for more training, employees who have a good experience with DataCamp and then advocate to incorporate the platform into their teams at work, and professors at universities who use the DataCamp platform to teach their students new skills. DataCamp serves 80% of Fortune 1000 companies, helping them upskill their employees. While it is not as large as massive open online course (MOOC) providers like Coursera or edX, DataCamp is recognized as one of the fastest-growing technology, media, telecommunications, life sciences, and energy tech companies in North America, with a total of 618,000 active learners (26) . We obtained deidentified individual-level data from DataCamp between January 2018 and September 2020 with information on which courses individuals have taken, which exercises they completed, whether they completed the course, their platform subscript status, and their zip code-level location. Our sample consists of 618,000 users who are located in the United States and who have completed at least one course exercise. Depending on the target outcome in the analysis, we narrow down our focal sample to either 277,425 users who newly registered or 69,942 users who were active on the platform during the 22 wk before or after NBCs went into effect. We chose 22 wk because the last week in our sample where all 50 states and the District of Columbia were represented was 22 wk after NBC.

For each individual's zip code, we observe the population density, the median household income, the income distribution (the share with less than $15,000, $15,000 to $29,000, $30,000 to $39,000, $40,000 to $49,000, $50,000 to $59,000, $60,000 to $99,000, $100,000 to $149,000, over $150,000), the race distribution, the age distribution (the share under age 18, age 18 to 24, age 25 to 44, age 45 to 64, and age 65+), the education distribution (the share with less than a high school degree, some college, and college or more), the poverty rate (the share of people living in poverty under age 18, age 18 to 64, and age 65+), and the industry and occupational distribution. We also recognize that, while there might be heterogeneity in how male and female users respond to NBC, there is not enough variation across zip codes in the share of males vs. females to tease out these effects.

For example, areas that were more adversely affected could experience an exodus of residents; controlling for these factors ensures that the comparison is between observationally equivalent areas.",

Our identifying assumption is that unobserved shocks to the demand for online learning are uncorrelated with the time that states enacted their NBC, conditional on a set of observable covariates including coronavirus cases. Because states adopted NBC policies at different points in time, state fixed effects allow us to compare outcomes in states that adopted NBCs sooner with those that adopted them later. Fig. 3 shows the share of states with NBC over time: it increases from 4 to 100% between the second and fifth weeks of March 2020. This staggered adoption of NBC provides sufficient temporal variation to identify causal effects. We decided to focus on NBC rather than SAHO in our analysis partly because SAHOs were implemented within a more compressed period of time, providing less within-state variation.",

To ensure our decision was meaningful, we studied two of the major policies by state, the SAHO and NBC. SAHO generally occurred 1 or 2 wk after NBC. We found that the change in our outcomes aligned more closely with NBC, namely that the increases in users and exercises aligned with this date for our sample. This makes intuitive sense as we consider the nature of our project, exploring change in online learning, which is likely associated more with individuals who would be affected by NBC.",
