To identify the CAP-associated genetic risk loci, we performed a meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed CAP (3,310 individuals) with 2,655 healthy controls. The findings revealed CYP1A1 variants (rs2606345, rs4646903, rs1048943) associated with pneumonia. We observed rs2606345 [G vs T; OR=1.49(1.29-1.69); p=0.0001; I 2 = 15.5%], and rs1048943 [T vs G; OR= 1.31(0.90-1.71); p=0.002; I 2 =19.3%] as risk markers and rs4646903 [T vs C; OR= 0.79(0.62-0.96); p=0.03; I 2 =0%] as a protective marker for susceptibility to CAP, when compared with healthy controls. Our meta-analysis showed the presence of CYP1A1 SNP alleles contributing significant risk toward pneumonia susceptibility. Interestingly, we observed a striking difference of allele frequency for rs2606345 (CYP1A1) among Europeans, Africans and Asians which may provide a possible link for observed variations in death due to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), a viral pneumonia. We report, for the first time, a significant positive correlation for the risk allele (T or A) of rs2606345, with a higher COVID-19 mortality rate worldwide and within a genetically heterogeneous nation like India.",

We note that ambient air pollution, a powerful inducer of CYP1A1 gene expression, is globally associated with lower, not higher mortality, as would normally be predicted. In conclusion, we find that CYP1A1 alleles are associated with CAP mortality, presumably via altered xenobiotic metabolism. We speculate that gene-environment interactions governing CYP1A1 expression may influence COVID-19 mortality.",

The global burden of disease study (2015) stated that lower respiratory infections like pneumonia are the third most common cause of death globally [1] . Pneumonia occurs when pathogens enter in the alveoli, infect, multiply and encourage a host immune response. These responses cause inflammation of the lung tissues, marking the pathogenesis of pneumonia [2] . Host genetic factors that participate in these processes starting from pathogen entry, infection, inflammation, and resolution can all be considered as good candidates in genetic association studies of pneumonia and its complications [3, 4] .",

            "text": "A number of studies have investigated the genetic association as well as gene interaction of pneumonia risk with monooxygenase enzyme group, cytochrome P450 (CYP). In a study, a group of researcher identified CYP1A1 cytochrome P450 family 1 subfamily A member 1 (CYP1A1) as a critical regulator of inflammatory responses and phagocytosis in sepsis some through CYP1A1-involved signalling pathways that may be promising targets for treating sepsis or other inflammatory diseases [5] . Interestingly, few other studies indicated towards the role of CYP1A1 genetic polymorphisms in infectious diseases and consequently establishing its role in inflammatory responses. Previously, it was identified that genetic variants of some host genes (CYP1A1, ACE and IL-6) are associated with the diversity in response to CAP [6, 7] . The selection of this gene was established based on its role in physiological and pathological processes during pneumonia infection, particularly in the immune and inflammatory responses [6] . Hence, we selected this gene. The most widely reported CYP1A1 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were rs2606345, rs4646903 and rs1048943. These SNPs had functional consequences which may ultimately be involved with a disease phenotype like pneumonia. The intron-located rs2606345 (C>A) determines enhanced gene expression in the presence of specific substrates (allele C) or in their absence (allele A). The minor allele of rs4646903C, located near the 3' UTR, also shows an increased inducibility. Another CYP1A1 SNP rs1048943 (T>A, C, G) (Ile/Val), resulted in a missense amino acid substitution, is characterized by the substrate-specific increased activity for minor allele G. Thus we can suggest that genetically determined alteration of CYP1A1 activity could contribute to lung inflammation pathogenesis. Thus, while there may be several evidence directing towards the role of this gene and/or its genetic variants in pneumonia susceptibility, so far, we lack a common mechanistic framework that integrates it all.",

The primary objectives of this meta-analysis are: (1) to determine a precise numerical estimate of the impact of CYP1A1 risk allele and pneumonia risk, (2) to determine whether age or sex alters the odds of incident pneumonia in presence of the CYP1A1 SNP alleles (3) to determine whether any association between CYP1A1 and CAP is generalizable to COVID-19. We hypothesized that CYP1A1 genetic variant would increase the odds of incident pneumonia and COVID-19 mortality.",

The disease is caused by host inflammatory responses affecting the lungs and lung blood vessels [27] . Physiologically, the virus enter into the host system by attaching to angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors [28] . The viral RNA, on release, hijacks the host cell's machinery to initiate viral replication and spread. The SARS-CoV-2 infection, triggers both innate and adaptive immune responses (both humoral and cell-mediated immunity). In the later stage when the infection spreads the epithelialendothelial barrier integrity of lungs is compromised. It also infects the lung capillary endothelial cells, producing a rush of inflammatory response by influx of an army of immune cells like monocytes, neutrophils, macrophages infiltrating to the alveolar spaces [29] . This activates the host immune system to release the cytokines, several inflammatory cytokines (IL-1, IL-6, TNF\u03b1, and IFN\u03b3) [30] . Interestingly, the CYP P450 enzyme activity has been involved in the inflammatory response [31, 32] . Fang et al. first observed a significant reduction in CYP1A1 expression in pigs infected with Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae compared with the naive controls lung [33] . Later, a report validated that CYP1A1 suppress the inflammatory response caused by M. hyopneumoniae infection, via PPAR-signaling pathway [32] . Tian Li X et al. demonstrated on bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, CYP1A1 gene was upregulated, resulting in increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 [5] . They also suggested that this upregulation reduced the phagocytosis of the bacteria in the macrophages by decreasing the expression of SR-A, a macrophage channel crucial for phagocytosis. As a target regulated by CYP1A1, PPAR-\u03b3 inhibits the expression of inflammatory activating factors along with NF-\u03baB factors [32] and increased CYP1A1 expression is repressed by inhibition of NF-\u03baB [34] .

Demographic and socio-economic factors may account for COVID-19 case fatality rate (CFR) variations [39, 40] . Here, we focussed on environmental factors that may be indirectly interacting with CYP1A1. While there have been concerns about air pollution leading to increased COVID-19 deaths [41] , the most affected nations seem to be those with the best air quality [40] . In one of our previous findings, we have shown that the A allele (rs2606345) is responsible for a 70-80% reduction in promoter activity, which would reduce enzyme activity [17] . As a caveat, induction of CYP1A1 would be expected to be protective. This interpretation could explain counterintuitive lower mortality in regions with higher ambient air pollution, since pollutants are known to be a powerful inducer of CYP1A1 gene expression [42] . The unexpected associations of smoking (induces CYP1A1 gene expression [43, 44] with COVID-19 severity [45] and death [46] could also be understood in this framework.

COVID-19 mortality is extracted from ourworldindata.org till 24 May 2021. The minor allele frequency distribution is plotted for SNPs across global populations of rs2606345. The data is obtained from population frequency data of the 1000genome browser on 8 March, 2021. Air quality is represented by concentration of particulate matter of size 2.5 micrometres (\u00b5m) (PM2.5). The data is obtained from ourworldindata.org till 2016. The white coloured areas in the map show the absence of data. A half open intervals includes only one of its end-points and is denoted by mixing notations for open and closed intervals. For e.g., (0-1] means greater than 0 and less than or equal to 1 and [0,1) means greater than or equal to 0 and less than 1.

            "text": "the Indian population data, the recorded COVID-19 related death was retrieved from the ministry of health and family welfare (https://www.mohfw.gov.in/) as on 24 May 2021. The regional case fatality rate (CFR) was calculated as total number of COVID-19 related death upon a sum of total death and total patients recovered [60]. The R version 3.4.2 (R Project for Statistical Computing) was used for statistical analyses and spatial analysis plots. Initially, the data cleaning process was performed wherein we remove the missing values from the two datasets. The variable of interest includes total death per millions and SNP (rs2606345) 'A' allele frequency. We first estimated if COVID-19 mortality among countries varied with the allele frequency. For this, we conducted a linear regression and calculated the Pearson's correlation coefficient. Pearson's correlation analysis to investigate the linear or nonlinear relationship between two continuous variables. Utilizing this association, a simple linear regression model was applied to measure the relationship between mortality (dependent variable) and 'A' allele frequency of rs2606345 (independent variable).The goodness of fit (r 2 ) was evaluated to determine the model (p< 0.05).SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIALSThe Supplementary Material for this article can be found online atAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONSRK devised the concept of the review, reviewed the manuscript and supervised the overall study till final manuscript preparation.
