This may be related to the assumption that vaccines should prevent infection completely. It also appears this group thinks if they have not been infected in the past, they will not experience it in the future. Moreover, they have fewer concerns about this pandemic. As a point of reference, a research found that healthcare workers who are not involved with or caring for COVID-19 positive patients seem to be more vaccine-hesitant and have less worries, which is consistent with our results (Dror et al., 2020) .",
