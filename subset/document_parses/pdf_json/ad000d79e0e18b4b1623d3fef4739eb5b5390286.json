As part of the Internet of Things (IoT) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] , wearables are small portable computer systems, such as smart watches, that are Open Access *Correspondence: tiberius@uni-potsdam.de 1 University of Potsdam, Potsdam, Germany Full list of author information is available at the end of the article Page 2 of 7 Neumann et al. BMC Medical Informatics and Decision Making (2022) 22:112 worn on the body or clothing [8] [9] [10] and that monitor various health measures using biosensors [11] . They have become increasingly popular in recent years [12] [13] [14] and are developing into an integral part of personal analytics, measuring physical condition, recording physiological parameters or information about medication plans [15] . Combined with health apps, wearables are considered beneficial in areas such as increased fitness, preventive healthcare (prophylaxis) and chronic disease monitoring [16, 17] , which leads to both health benefits and cost savings [18] [19] [20] . Furthermore, telemedicine services through wearable-based health monitoring can lead to improved access to healthcare for an ageing society like Germany by reducing in-person clinic appointments [3, 4, 21] . Additionally, data could be tracked continuously rather than with long breaks. Therefore, wearables and health apps can be cost-effective digital solutions for the wider sector of the health system [22, 23] , representing a radical innovation [24] partly disrupting traditional health monitoring. The recent COVID-19 pandemic, with personal contact restrictions, has particularly shown the benefits of such telemedicine approaches. Patients can be informed about their health status by voice-controlled intelligent assistants (VIPAs) [25] or by doctors using social media channels [26] , based on data from their wearables. Despite these advantages, the actual usage of wearables for assessing individual risk scores for health insurance currently remains limited. The objective of this study is to identify and rank the barrier factors influencing wearable usage for assessing individual risk scores for health insurances in Germany. The conclusions from this study may be applicable for other countries as well.",

In a survey, it was found that 33% of respondents from 16 different countries used wearables and health apps to record their fitness or health [27] . Considering the novelty of this technology, this share is already relatively high. However, the majority still lacks interest or may find the technology too expensive [28] . Among the users of wearables, only 1% used devices sponsored by their health insurers [29] .

The findings can help insurers, wearable manufacturers, and health app developers to avoid shortcomings that impede customized health insurance contributions and adverse properties of wearables and health apps. The results of the study imply that regulation is the most pressing barrier factor. Another major problem are false or inaccurate measurements and application errors caused by the users.",

The experts were asked to indicate as many perceived barriers as possible. The minimum requirement was to specify three possible barriers. A total of 58 barriers were mentioned by the experts. Consolidating the list of barriers was carried out in three steps. First, each statement was copied onto a table. Second, the statements that had the same meaning were then grouped to barrier categories. Third, duplicates and statements belonging to the same category were removed. As a result, a total of eleven barrier categories remained. Narrowing down the list was unnecessary due to the manageable number of entries [47] .",

Table 1 depicts the panel profile. Seven experts were female (43.75%) and 9 were male (56.25%). The experts were 38.69 years old on average and had an average work experience of 9.72 years. Twelve respondents (75%) worked for health insurance companies and four (25%) worked for wearable manufacturers, all in the software department. The proportion of experts with a wearable background was deliberately kept low because we assumed that they may be subject to a desirability bias [44, 45] , seeing more opportunities rather than barriers for wearables as working for a producer usually involves a high level of identification with the product [58] .",

The final results from the thirdround show that regulation barriers (i.e., privacy issues and data protection as well as other legal requirements) are the most important ones. In the third and fourth places follow inaccurate measurements and application errors as issues the users are responsible for. The fifth most relevant barrier addresses the insurers, particularly their lack of technological competence to use the wearable data appropriately. Barriers six and seven are principal considerations, namely that data from wearables is generally not suitable to calculate individual contributions and that a contributions customization is not compatible with the solidary principle of insurances. Less relevant barriers are a lack of people's acceptance of wearing wearables in public, a bad cost-benefit ratio of individual contributions, a lack of access to wearables, and fear of higher insurance contributions as a consequence of suggested unhealthy behavior. Whereas in the second round, several barriers were seen as equally relevant, the third round led to clearer differentiations. The order of the barriers hardly changed. Only the three barriers on places five to seven, i.e., the medium-relevant barriers, saw slight shifts. A possible lack of technological competence at health insurers and the missing suitability of data from wearables for contributions adjustments were seen as slightly more relevant in the third round, whereas the violation of the solidarity principle was rated as less relevant. These only slight changes suggested that a fourth survey round was not necessary. This is further suggested by an increased consensus in the group, which can be measured by a reduction of the average standard deviation. The average standard deviation was 2.63 in the second round, whereas it was 2.13 in the third round.",

These issues are particularly important for health insurers, as data generated by wearables must have a minimum level of reliability and have to be free from manipulation. If this is not the case, there is a risk that contributors manipulate their transmitted data to their advantage and thereby reduce the contributions to be paid, although the actual health data would not allow this. However, it is not clear if these barriers really exist or are just the insurers' concerns. Empirical observations could clarify this. We call on future research to investigate this. If the assumption is confirmed, periodical or random measurements in medical practices could be executed. Handling errors, without the intention to manipulate data, could be diminished by (online) trainings and tutorials. It is unclear if health insurers really show a lack of technological competence to use wearable data. This also should be found out by future studies. However, it is questionable if insurers really need that competence or, more likely, IT service providers will be used to handle data management. In either case, it appears to be less of a problem to overcome the potential lack of technological competence.",

However, even if data protection laws become stricter, the users' privacy concerns could partly remain. More transparency regarding the collaboration between wearables manufacturers, health app providers, and health insurers could lead to an increased trust among users. For example, health insurers could test and certify both wearable devices and health apps or develop their own health apps to ensure that the sensitive generated health data is only forwarded to the health insurer and its legitimate IT service providers but no other parties.
