We excluded 127 articles published as review articles, letters, editorial materials, meeting abstracts, corrections, and retracted publications. Furthermore, we excluded 13 articles published in a non-English language (Spanish, France, Hungarian, Italian, Russian, and German). After screening all titles and abstracts, eight-hundred twenty-eight articles were excluded due to a lack of adherence to the inclusion criteria, and seven-hundred twenty-nine articles were included in our study (Supplementary Figure S1 ). Table 1 shows the distribution of articles in the top 10 countries. About 26.06% (190/729) of the articles were published in the Republic of China. The United States of America was the second highest country (173/729, 23.73%), followed by India (92/729, 12.62%). The number of citations was higher in the papers published from China and the USA, followed by Canada and Italy. Two-hundred ninety-eight journals published 729 research articles. As shown in Table 2 , PLOS One (n = 33, 4.52%), Chaos Solution Fractals (n = 29, 3.97%), and Journal of Medical Internet Research (n = 29, 3.97%) were the three journals that published a higher number of articles; followed by IEEE Access (27, 3.70%) and Applied Intelligence (n = 21, 2.88%). However, the International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health (n = 221, 28.36%) had higher citations, followed by Chaos Solution Fractals (n = 201, 25.80%). Table 3 shows the top 10 research areas, which published papers on AI and COVID-19. The research areas of computer science artificial intelligence (n = 85, 11.66%), computer science information systems (n = 77, 10.56%), and multidisciplinary science (n = 75, 10.28%) were the top ones on the application of AI to COVID-19. However, radiology nuclear medicine imaging, and computer science information systems had higher citations than the other research areas. Table 4 presents the authors' keywords used in the study of AI and COVID-19. It is divided into four groups: (1) disease (2) technology (3) types of data, and (4) research focus. In the disease group, COVID-19 was the most common keyword, followed by SARS-CoV-2 and coronavirus. Among all the keywords provided by authors on technology research, the top 5 technologies were deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, convolutional neural networks, and transfer learning. The application of AI to COVID-19 was mainly focused on pandemics, prediction, classification, and diagnoses. VOSviewer classified 1824 keywords into 22 clusters, as shown in Figure 1 . The strengths of the association of COVID-19, deep learning, machine learning, SARS-CoV-2, and coronavirus were 1429, 559, 515, 300, and 286. Author contribution and global cooperation: We applied a cut-off of two papers per author and presented the global cooperation of authors visually. Among 4233 authors, Figure 2 shows the cooperation of 315 authors globally. Nineteen authors had a strong collaboration with others and published at least four papers together. The thickness of the line shows the association among the authors, and the size of the circle shows the number of articles published together.
