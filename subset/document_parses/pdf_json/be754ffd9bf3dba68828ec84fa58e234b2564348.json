WHO has estimated >1 in 10 births is preterm. While Asian individuals have a relatively low incidence of preterm birth, China still has the second largest absolute number of preterm births in the world. 2 Preterm birth is the primary contributor to perinatal morbidity and mortality. Additionally, preterm birth survivors and their families frequently withstand long-term adverse consequences such as cerebral palsy. 3 4 Relatively few cases of preterm birth can be prevented using currently available strategies because the aetiology of spontaneous preterm birth is multifactorial. 5 Both Denmark and Ireland studies have provided evidence indicating significant reductions in the number of extremely preterm and very low birthweight births following implementation of national COVID-19 mitigation measures. 6 7 Also, the Netherlands study reported the decrease of moderate-to-late preterm incidence. 8 However, the study from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, found no change in preterm birth or stillbirths associated with the lockdown. 9 COVID-19 mitigation measures have been implemented by different countries with substantial variation in timing, content, intensity and comprehensiveness. Furthermore, various risk factors for preterm birth that might be responsive to lockdown measures also vary across populations. As such, international data from various population are important to further study the association between COVID-19 mitigation measures and preterm births, to explore differential impact between spontaneous and induced preterm deliveries and to identify the potential underlying mechanisms.",

We examined data from all pregnant women who received care at SFMIH from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2020. SFMIH is now the largest obstetric care centre in Shanghai, as well as in China. According to Shanghai guidelines, women with uncomplicated pregnancies are offered at least 9-10 antenatal visits, the first one occurring between 8 and 9 weeks of gestation when gestational age is determined by ultrasound examination. 10 Inclusion criteria for the present study included all singleton pregnancy. Multiple births were excluded from the analysis due to the more complicated aetiologies and increased risk of preterm birth. We also excluded infants delivered prior to 24 complete weeks because China national perinatal guidelines advise no active management for infants of <24 complete weeks. Thus, the preterm is defined as birth that occurs after 24 weeks and before the completion of 37 gestational weeks. We further divided preterm birth into spontaneous preterm due to premature parturitional process, and iatrogenic preterm because the health of the mother or fetus was at risk (eg, with major haemorrhage, hypertension or poor fetal growth). Small for gestational age (SGA) and large for gestational age (LGA) were defined based on Asian sex-specific and gestational age-specific birth weight reference curves. 11 Data collection and covariates The information engineer and study group abstracted and extracted data from the hospital electronic medical records based on criteria set forth on the standardised form for data collection.The abstracted information from medical records included maternal demographic characteristics, medical and surgical history, obstetric complications, type of conception (natural or in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer assisted), labour and delivery summaries, postpartum maternal and neonatal information. Based on review of the literature on preterm, the following covariates were considered as potential confounders: prepregnant body mass index (PPBMI), maternal age, education level, insurance status, marriage status, conception type, gender of fetus, maternal chronic medical conditions and obstetric complications including hypertensive disorders, pregestational diabetes and gestational diabetes (DM and GDM) and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP).",

The preterm birth rates were generally stable during the study period with rates of 5.2%-5.6%. A clear discontinuity of preterm rate in the regression lines was observed for the COVID-19 mitigation measures introduced on 23 January 2020 (figure 1). In additional stratified analyses, we could determine the discontinuity mainly stemmed from spontaneous preterm (figure 1) and moderate-to-late preterm birth (32 complete weeks to 36 weeks and 6 days, figure 2 ). The rate of iatrogenic preterm was relatively constant surrounding implementation of measures to reduce the spread of the virus. Accordingly, the lockdown measures were consistently associated with significant reductions in preterm birth in the 2-month, 3-month, 4-month, 5-month time windows after implementation (+2 months, OR 0.80, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.94; +3 months, OR 0.83, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.94; +4 months, OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.73 to 0.92; +5 months, OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.93, table 2).

Our large study assessed the impact of COVID-19 mitigation measures implemented in China on the incidence of preterm birth with data abstracted directly from electronic medical records, which was different from the Netherlands and Danish studies using blood spot screening programme. 6 8 Our dataset had individual-level information on relevant covariates, including demographic information, parity, medical and obstetric complications, induction and delivery information, therefore, we could minimise the influence of changes in demographic composition of the population following mitigation measures (eg, through the mitigation of population flow), which might have contributed to the findings. Also, our analysis was able to explore differential impact between spontaneous and iatrogenic preterm deliveries. By using the same quasi-experimental approach as the Netherlands study did, our study progressed substantially from earlier studies that we also had the preterm information after the mitigation measures when life and work was back to normal in Chinese population, thus strengthening causal interpretation of the observed association between the COVID-19 mitigation measures and reduced preterm birth incidences.",

In the Irish study, rates of extremely low birthweight and very low birthweight births were lower between 1 January 2020 and 30 April 2020, than in the same period in the preceding 19 years. 7 Only one extremely preterm birth had been observed in the Danish study using national blood spot screening data in the first month following COVID-19 lockdown, whereas five to six were calculated. The observed reduction in preterm births in Denmark and Ireland predominantly affected the smallest babies, and the numbers were small. 6 7 The information on stillbirths was unavailable in these two studies, thus one cannot discern whether a part of the observed reduction in very early preterm births occurred at the expense of an increase in stillbirths. A study in a London (UK) hospital compared birth outcomes before and after the outbreak of COVID-19 pandemic revealed no changes in the incidence of births prior to 34 or 37 gestational weeks. 12 The authors observed an increase in stillbirths of six per 1000 births following the pandemic. However, this study had a small sample size and it did not specifically investigate the effect of the mitigation measures. Importantly, we did not observe an increase in the stillbirth rate during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, found no change in preterm birth or stillbirths associated with the lockdown. 9 The differences between studies may be due to varieties in the strictness and comprehensiveness of lockdown measures, enforcement of lockdown orders, access to healthcare or financial and social stressors.",

            "text": "Countless studies have been carried to clarify the aetiology of spontaneous preterm and to explore effective preventive strategies. Efforts have been largely disappointing because the aetiology of prematurity is complex. 13 The COVID-19 mitigation measures might affect some known risk factors for preterm birth. These risk factors include asymptomatic infection and inflammation which can cause intrauterine infection and inflammation through vertical transmission, initiating a succession of mechanism resulting in preterm birth. Wearing masks, keeping physical distance and staying at home, closing of schools and childcare facilities, lack of population flow and increased awareness of hygiene (eg, hand washing and window opening) all reduce contact with pathogens and minimise the risk of some infections. It had been reported that common infectious disease morbidity decreased during the COVID-19 emergency response, thus reducing overall inflammatory state of pregnant women. 14 The literature on a potential association between work and premature birth however is contradictory. 15 The potential reduced physical demands associated with less work, less travel and even reductions in minor transportation accidents could all be possible contributors. Women were more likely to prepare food at home as opposed to eating in a restaurant which may have improved nutrition and working from home may have also optimised sleep duration, which could all have a positive influence on prematurity rates. 16 Substantial BMJ Global Health reductions in air pollution have also been reported following COVID-19 mitigation measures, including in China. 17 Given exposure to air pollution is the recognised increased risk of delivering preterm, this finding could also explain the observed reductions. 18 The short timing window of the observed preterm birth reductions in our study suggests that hygiene measures and behavioural changes related to mitigation measures might have been instrumental.",
