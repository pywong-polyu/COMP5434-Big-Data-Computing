Although physical care used to be the most prominent focus, recently, there has been a shift toward a holistic view of the person and person-centered care, seeing the whole person and their physical, psychological, spiritual, and social dimensions. There has been a change from more passive care to active care, with meaningful activities highlighted as important in long-term care (Ministry of Health and Care Services, 2018). In Norway, \"teaching nursing homes\" have been established with the intention of enhancing and developing the quality of care provided in nursing homes (Ministry of Health and Care Services, 2006 ). In the current study, two nursing homes were used as the sites for an observational study design looking at social innovative practices for making everyday life meaningful for the residents.",

To have a meaningful life is important for all people, regardless of their age or living situation. When an old person moves into an institution, they become dependent on healthcare personnel for possibilities to create meaning in their everyday life. This is what nursing is about (Travelbee, 1971) . However, how to facilitate meaning in life for nursing home residents has not been fully explored, but it is important for residents to experience dignity in everyday life when living in an institution (Kinnear et al., 2015; Sletteb\u00f8 et al., 2017) . There is a need for a cultural change in nursing homes that includes the ethics of care. In the literature, some cultural changes in aged-care facilities have been found to be crucial. These include changes, such as more individualized care, the facilitation of more meaningful relationships, better opportunities for participation in life roles more generally, and the possibilities for the residents to experience a new sense of belonging (Andrew and Ritchie, 2017) .",

Meaning-making is considered to have three different meanings: \"(a) cognitive processes of attribution and appraisal, (b) creative work of employing one's gifts to make a useful contribution, and (c) narrative process of constructing a personal story to make sense of an event or one's life\" (Wong, 2017, p. 86) . However, an important question regarding meaning-making is what is really meaning-making for this particular person and under what circumstances. Then, one may discuss particular types of meaning-making and if different meanings of the concept are made helpful and why (Park, 2010) . Also, meaningfulness has two different aspects, mainly the cognition which is making sense of life and motivation which is to have a sense of purpose in life (Wong, 2017) .",

This is interesting findings also regarding older people in nursing homes as meaningfulness is important for thriving. Phenomena that may contribute to residents' experiences of meaningfulness is found to be personal relationships, especially with family, but also to create moments of personal growths may increase meaning in life for older people also lacking cognitive difficulties (Dewitte et al., 2019) . In a recent article, the components of meaning: coherence, purpose, and significance, were studied in a sample of residents lacking Alzheimer's disease (Dewitte et al., 2021) . The participants had a felt coherence rather than a cognitive one, and the purpose was not futureoriented any longer. However, the most important phenomenon for them to experience meaning in life were relationships and family. This understanding of meaning in life is consistent with the three components comprehension, purpose, and mattering (George and Park, 2016 Social innovation is important to facilitate a culture that underpins a meaningful everyday life for nursing home residents.

The field notes were recorded and transcribed in full. The two researchers observed one nursing home each; they were observing in the common area at the nursing homes, but were not participating in care activities that took place in the private rooms of the residents. Sometimes, they were talking with the staff to get a deeper understanding of what was happening in some situations. Some days, they observed more generally what happened at the living rooms or day center, and some days, they followed particular nurses to observe how they performed daily activities in common areas. Two in-depth interviews were conducted with nursing home leaders at the start of the observation period. The interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. The interviews lasted between 68 and 70 min. The role of the interview was to deepen the understanding of the philosophy of the nursing home leaders in front of the data collection through the field observations. Thus, the main data came from field notes from the observations. The transcriptions from the interviews were analyzed as text, together with the data from the field notes. In addition, two dialogue meetings were conducted with the staff of the two nursing homes at the beginning and after a period of 2 years (a total of four meetings), and the minutes were added to field notes and analyzed accordingly.",

These codes were \"social innovation, \" \"nutritional status, \" \"open nursing home, \" \"meaning in life, \" and \"meaningful activities. \" The analysis process is described in a table (see Table 1 ).

As a subtheme, we found that an open nursing home was an institution that made it possible for residents to experience meaningful everyday lives. This contrasts the \"total institution\" described by Erving Goffman in the 1960s (Goffman, 1961) . Goffman (1961) describes the \"total institution\" as an institution that regulates and maintains the behavior of the patients and healthcare workers in a predictable and controlled way, such that they are \"institutionalized\" by knowing their social role within the institutional frames. In addition, a \"total institution\" is characterized by being separated from the surrounding environment; it is self-contained, with its own routines and frames. The risk of institutionalization and confinement for elderly is discussed by Ramkissoon (2020a) . Ramkissoon (2020a) defines place confinement as perceived threat to mobility and affecting physical immobility where residents are restricted to their place of residence. Where residents' physical activity is limited or restricted, it may result in feelings of dependency and impact feelings of well-being and quality of life (Ramkissoon, 2020a (Ramkissoon, ,b, 2021 . However, place attachment may be fostered as a positive relationship to the environment. Ramkissoon et al. (2013, p. 554 ) defines place attachment as the bonding people share with places and consists of place dependence, place identity, place affect, and place social bonding. There has been a change in the ideologies of nursing homes from being closed and self-sufficient to being open and inviting the community into the institution. Thus, if healthcare personnel could help residents with enhancing feelings of place attachments to the environment surrounding the nursing home, it may impact their health, well-being and quality of life. Ramkissoon (2021) recommends promoting place affect interventions. Collaboration between residents, relatives, neighbors, and healthcare personnel opened up the institutions and the possibilities for residents to participate in the community as they had before they moved into nursing homes. This collaboration between residents and the community was also shown to be positive in Andrew and Ritchie's research (Andrew and Ritchie, 2017) .",

            "text": "We found that the residents needed different activities, and the staff at the participating nursing homes respected this. The healthcare personnel customized activities for each resident. Some of the residents were taken on tours with a rickshaw bike, while others were taken for small walks in the sensory garden; this depended on the resident's capacity and motivation for activities. Some residents spent their time at the day center, where there were more activities, while others sat in the daily room or balcony on the ward, where it was quieter and there were fewer activities. This could be experienced as \"slow nursing\" (Lillekroken, 2020) , where there is time to rest and have quiet time. This also gives healthcare personnel time for the residents to do the activities at a slower pace. This customization helped provide activities that could give the residents meaningful lives. The nursing homes were also customized for the residents to participate in different activities. However, there were some hindrances, as mentioned in the findings regarding the steep sensory garden. Even though the staff commented that this was not ideal, they did their best with the situation. The necessity of adjusting the surroundings of nursing homes has been pointed out in other research. Nordin et al. (2017) found that adjusting the environment at the nursing home was important so that the residents could do activities on their own. However, we found that the activities were not something that the residents were forced to participate in but instead something that they enjoyed participating in and that gave their lives meaning. This was in line with the \"Joy of Life Nursing Home\" movement, as well as with the research on dignity for residents in nursing homes (Shotton and Seedhouse, 1998; Brodtkorb et al., 2017; Sletteb\u00f8 et al., 2017; De Vriendt et al., 2019) .",

De Vriendt et al. (2019) provide a \"because activities should be meaningful\" approach with four dimensions: getting to know each other; self-prioritized goals; plan and actions; and evaluation and outcome. In a pilot study, the authors find that meaningful activities of daily living were enabled by a participatory client-centered approach, improving satisfaction and social life, and decreasing medication use in long-term care facilities (De Vriendt et al., 2019) . Meaningful lives in nursing home residents may be fostered by focusing on positive affect and relationships, especially with family and to do activities together. By fostering resident's positive affect the healthcare personnel can promote affective ties to a place for the resident such as the environment surrounding the nursing home, and thus support health, well-being and enhance quality of life for the residents (Ramkissoon, 2020a (Ramkissoon, ,b, 2021 . Healthcare personnel can enhance meaningfulness in life with helping to create positive well-being, happiness, and better coping in residents (King et al., 2006 (King et al., , 2016 Glaw et al., 2017; Crego et al., 2020) . This may be important for actually offer person-centered care to nursing home residents which is emphasized in the current study. Hauge and Heggen (2008) describe nursing homes as homes, explaining how common rooms, such as the dining room, can be used to enhance socialization and, thus, meaningfulness in everyday life. This is in line with the theoretical concept of personcentered care in nursing homes. The focus on the resident's life history is fundamental both in the person-centered care theory and in the \"Joy of Life Nursing Home\" movement, in which both the represented nursing homes participated in. The findings in the current study expand the understanding of the theory of person-centered care that a nursing home that is open toward society and expanding the community of practice where customized activities are facilitated were an important part of improving culture change and implementing person-centered care. In addition, it aligns with the understanding of person, which is outlined by McCormack (2004) and the four understandings of personcenteredness of Kitwood (1997) and McCormack (2004) of being in relation, being in a social world, being in place and being with self. Another aspect of person-centered care that is new knowledge from the current study expanding the understanding of person-centered care, is mealtime and meals that were enjoyable and customized for each individual resident, which also helped prevent unrest and disturbing behavior together with special care for each resident and their behavioral challenges.",

There were other interactions that the residents enjoyed, such as when choirs or musicians performed concerts and the residents sang along. However, it may be a challenge to conduct these types of interactions in a way that engages all participants equally (Jennings, 2018) . A secondary analysis of nursing home data showed that introducing a caf\u00e9 in aged-care facilities contributed to transforming both the physical and social environment (Andrew and Ritchie, 2017) . Social support seems to be very important for the social climate among healthcare personnel in nursing homes and, thus, for job satisfaction and job motivation. This, in turn, has an impact on healthcare services in nursing homes and the services given to residents (Adams et al., 2017) . The need for meet basic needs and personal relations (Hoeyberghs et al., 2019) is shown for psychologically frail older people and should be considered when giving person-centered care to residents in nursing homes.",

            "text": "In the current study, we found that mealtime at the nursing homes had been changed so that dinner would be served later in the afternoon rather than at noon. This may be described as social innovation, as defined by Pue et al. (2016) , where change is a process of socially creative strategies that reconfigure social relations. The innovation improved the dietary status of the residents because they ate better and more. It also afforded time for meaningful activities in the morning before lunch and dinner. There is also evidence in the literature of the positive effects of changing dining and mealtimes (Robinson and Gallagher, 2008) . Changing the mealtimes allowed for more time in the morning to participate in meaningful activities. It could be relevant for the residents to experience meaning in life understood as comprehension, purpose, and mattering as discussed by George and Park (2016) . In addition, it offered more time between breakfast and dinner, so the nutritional status of the residents improved, allowing them more energy to participate in activities that made the days more meaningful. This could be seen in the participation that occurred when children from kindergarten came to visit or allowing the residents themselves to go out on tours with bicycles. Changing dining services may be important in cultural changes in nursing homes (Robinson and Gallagher, 2008) . Mealtime is considered important for nutritional status and socialization because residents should be allowed to make some choices regarding when, what, and where to eat and with whom. This is in line with the findings of Chwang (2012) , who discusses issues of malnutrition in older people. One suggestion is to improve the quality of food services in healthcare facilities to improve mealtime experiences. In addition, it is important to understand the physiological changes in older persons and the need for nutritional knowledge to provide adequate nutrition care for the aged. By establishing a caf\u00e9 in the nursing home, it is possible to enhance mealtimes in terms of individualizing care and socializing, providing the possibilities for new relationships and \"to meet with staff, old friends, families, and members of the community\" (Andrew and Ritchie, 2017, p. 42) . In Norway, the government has invited nursing homes to establish kitchens in nursing homes instead of larger units outside the nursing homes (Ministry of Health and Care Services, 2018). This is a new policy in which a homelike atmosphere should be prioritized by building a kitchen in each nursing home. This is also in line with the experiences of other countries (Andrew and Ritchie, 2017) .",

            "text": "The included nursing homes used GPS to prevent restlessness in residents who were uneasy and were calmed by walking. They did not have many fences and restrictions but let the persons wander as they wanted with GPS tracking. As our findings show, the use of GPS tracking allowed the residents to walk more freely without needed the staff to follow. For many of the residents, the walk outside gave meaning to their life and were enjoyable activities that made it easier to manage restlessness. To increase meaning in life for persons with cognitive difficulties family relationships and moments of personal growth is found to be important (Dewitte et al., 2019) . To have the opportunity to walk freely may be such moments enhancing experiences of meaningfulness. This again may be seen as a new dimension of person-centered care. This is supported by the research of Ramkissoon (2020a) who finds that residents with pro-social behavior have reduced mental distress. Instead, such behavior fosters attachment, belongingness, trust, and life satisfaction and that activities in the nature help reduce anxiety and distress. However, there are ethical issues involved in tracking residents, and these were discussed with the residents, their relatives, and physicians before implementation. It was found to be a less-intrusive intervention than physically restricting wandering persons who wanted to go for long walks. This is in line with ethical recommendations in the literature (Landau and Werner, 2012; Hofmann, 2013) . Because of the increasing number of older people in society, a welfare technology solution has been suggested. The ethical aspects of welfare technology are discussed in the literature (Landau and Werner, 2012; Hofmann, 2013) . There are some challenges, such as alienation from human-to-human relationships. There could be different goals among different stakeholders. Residents might want to walk freely without being tracked, and if there are not enough staff to follow them, GPS would be the preferred intervention. This challenges confidentiality and privacy for the residents and poses problems when it comes to respecting dignity and vulnerability. Therefore, the literature recommends open discussions between residents and relatives, together with healthcare personnel, before implementing GPS and other welfare technologies in the care of residents diagnosed with dementia (Landau and Werner, 2012; Hofmann, 2013) .",

The study took place at two typical mediumsize Norwegian nursing homes, which were considered innovative and accepted the researchers' request to study their practices. This is in line with the criteria of confirmability and credibility. The researchers were familiar with nursing home practices and were open to what had happened in the setting. They knew the context because they were nurses and nurse lecturers who had been at nursing homes before but were not well known at the nursing homes in the study. However, there is a limitation: Observation took place only in communal areas, not in the residents' rooms. The analysis was performed by the two observers and a researcher who did not participate in the observations, so we had both an inner and outer view of the data during the analysis. The research team discussed the analysis until agreement on the themes was reached. We have described the context and research process to the best of our ability so that transferability is possible; thus, the demand for trustworthiness is met. However, it must be considered that transferability to other contexts and countries may vary because of the different healthcare systems.",

Such practices contribute to opening the nursing home to the community, involving the whole facility and the surroundings, thereby establishing a community of practice for all members of the nursing home. This enables residents to experience a meaningful everyday life through customized activities, sufficient nutrition, and a pleasant milieu during mealtimes. By preventing behavior disturbances, it is also possible to promote meaningful lives in nursing homes. The current study adds to the theory of person-centered care that family relationships and moments of personal growth by fostering place attachment with the opportunity to walk freely, mealtime and meals that were enjoyable and customized for each individual resident, and helping to create positive well-being, happiness, and better coping in residents enhance experiences of well-being and quality of life by place bonding and meaningfulness. This again may be seen as new dimensions of person-centered care. In line with Ratwani (2017) suggesting that psychologists may support healthcare personnel with implementing Electronic Health Records, we suggest that the current study may imply that psychologist may support healthcare personnel with culture change in nursing homes when implementing these findings for enhancing meaningfulness and meaning-making for nursing home residents. Future research should look at how innovative practices and a more systematic opening of the nursing home to the community would foster homelike and meaningful stays in nursing homes.",
