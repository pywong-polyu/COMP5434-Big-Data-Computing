            "text": "This paper presents a counseling (ro)bot called Visual Counseling Agent (VICA) which focuses on remote mental healthcare. It is an agent system leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) to aid mentally distressed persons through speech conversation. The system terminals are connected to servers by the Internet exploiting Cloud-nativeness, so that anyone who has any type of terminal can use it from anywhere. Despite a promising voice communication interface, VICA shows limitations in conversation continuity on conventional 4G networks. Concretely, the use of the current 4G networks produces word dropping, delayed response, and the occasional connection failure. The objective of this paper is to mitigate these issues by leveraging a 5G/6G slice inclusive of mobile/multiple edge computing (MEC). First, we propose and partly implement the enhanced and advanced version of VICA. Servers of enhanced versions collaborate to increase speech recognition reliability. Although it significantly increases generated data volume, the advanced version enables a recognition of the facial expressions to greatly enhance counseling quality. Then, we propose a quality assurance mechanism using multiple levels of catalog, as well as 5G/6G slice inclusive of MEC, and conduct experiments to uncover issues related to the 4G. Results indicate that the number of speech recognition errors in Internet Cloud is more than twofold compared to edge computing, implying that quality assurance using 5G/6G in conjunction with VICA Counseling (ro)bot has higher efficiency.",

The components are connected through the Internet and are basically cloudnative, meaning that they can be used from anywhere, by anyone, and with any type or model of terminals. Terminals can either be a software robot (bot) or a physical robot. Counseling/consultancy is a kind of mental operation to mitigate the emotional distress or anxiety of clients. Meanwhile, there are many clients (> 2 million in Japan) who suffer from such disorders as PSTD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder), disasters, terrorist attacks, pandemics like Corona, or worldwide flu (influenza). Persons with just more simple anxiety or worry are still great in number. Compared with many such patients, there are few human counselors and few hospitals as well as limited telephone capacity. Availability of human counselors/consultants can be significantly low, especially in an emergency such as COVID-19 where possibly over a thousand people may want to consult at once. Thus, AI counselors/consultancy become necessary. However, on conventional networks such as 4G, VICA has serious problems of conversation discontinuation (short continuation) due to speech recognition quality. Especially in an emergency, the surge in demand easily expects to cause significant discontinuation problems due to the parallel use of VICA. The objective of this paper is a clarification of the method to reduce these problems of short continuation towards Proof of Concept (PoC) of VICA as a 5G use case. This goal is approached as follows: (1) analyzation of speech recognition quality problems, (2) recognition quality enhancement using multiple kinds of speech analyzers, (3) advanced way for continuing conversation using multiple sensors, (4) keeping continuity through multiple cataloguebased assurances of network connection and performance, and (5) estimation of the assurance effect.",

This is because such intrusive operations may easily hurt people who are very sensitive due to emotional distress. Instead, our counseling system uses \"sensitive (or active) listening\" skills with its related methodology for showing congruence, empathy, and unconditional positive regards advocated by Rogers [6, 7] . This is widely disseminated (around 30% used in the United States) and validated by counselors or therapists. VICA realizes these well-known counseling skills and methodology. It promotes conversation or confession (a well-known Christian technique [8] ) with digging but with unconditional positive regards, etc. towards self-awareness by the distressed persons themselves. To improve such counseling effect for real use, VICA has implemented a voice speech interface. Due to voice conversation, VICA has become largely different in practical usability from very toyish text-based counseling AI [9] , since people do not counsel ordinarily by text communication. Furthermore, VICA uses the best level of cloud-native speech recognizer such as Google speech-to-text cloud-based API (Application Programming Interface). Its high-precision speech recognition capability is especially necessary for our AI counseling to realize the above-mentioned \"sensitive listening\" skills to promote conversation.",

These issues need to be addressed for achieving conversationbased practical AI counseling. For this purpose, VICA uses high-performance and scalable cloud-native computing or SaaS (Software as a Service) such as Google speech-to-text cloud service. Indeed, this speech recognition service has the world's highest level of performance. However, it has generally produced one error every one or two sentences 4 . Furthermore, it sometimes takes several seconds in response time for a VICA agent to respond. These can cause inevitable difficulty in the conversation for practical AI counseling of our type. In the worst case, the connection/task falls down and the conversation (i.e., counseling) is forced to stop. These are problems of current VICA using voice communication. On the contrary, CRECA (which uses text to communicate) does not have such problems. Even just speech recognition has problems in accuracy and response continuity/time for practical use of AI counselors. Speech-to-text translation errors happen in less than every 10 sentences. It sometimes takes several seconds (sometimes more than 10 s) in response time. It also causes communication errors or even disconnection in a dialogue that is a prerequisite for counseling by VICA. Users become irritated and stop the conversation due to such response problems (disconnection in the worst case) or low quality of speech recognition. It happens even in spite of using the world's (as of today) highest level of cloud-native speech recognition servers such as Google speech-to-text cloud.

In case of such an emergency, data rate (bandwidth, transmission speed) also becomes a problem, besides the already mentioned network latency problem. High-speed network connectivity should be dynamically supported for up to 70K persons' sudden concurrent use, though even such number is nothing more than 0.5% of Tokyo citizens. It would become impossible for counseling or consultancy to continue the conversation under these serious conditions. Quick automatic network (slice) operation is necessary, so that distressed people can continue the conversation with VICA under such conditions. At least disconnection should be avoided. Currently, such (network slice) operation is usually done manually, even on software-defined networks. It takes more than 10 min in the worst case.

Servers and clients collaborate for speech recognition error recovery, towards less than one word per around every 20 sentences. For speech recognition quality assurance, recognition/translation error is checked at enhanced VICA servers. At enhanced VICA servers, text level recovery is done using various kinds of n-gram methods such as backward and forward with majority decision [11] . If errors are still suspected, terminals send voice input to speech recognizers again. These are repeated, while errors are suspected. Text transmission latency among servers and clients (if connected over inter-carrier), as well as the processing ability of enhanced VICA servers, are problems to be addressed. Transmission problems are caused in edge, in inter-carrier/Internet, and in cloud centers especially accessed concurrently in case of an emergency. Here, the edge includes radio and carrier backbone (core networks) from access point to providers. Although in text, low-latency connectivity between VICA terminals and servers is required for such recognition error recovery towards less than one-word error per tens of sentences. Besides text data transmission between counseling terminals and servers, voice data should be sent to the recognition cloud servers many times. The total amount of transmitted data becomes larger. It becomes a surge during emergencies. Therefore, enhanced VICA awaits 5G/6G and the agile slicing operation.",

Advanced version of VICA aiming at a higher quality of \"sensitive listening\" should communicate with clients not just through voice but also through other kinds of sensors. These sensors recognize the facial expression, heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen level, and so on. Clients' emotion is recognized not only by speech text but also by sensor signals. These signals are finally translated into text expressing the emotion. This multiple sensor information is obtained by servers in clouds or SaaS. Advanced VICA is proposed to use multi-sensor, especially image sensor fusion AI, so that it can obtain the much higher accuracy. Owing to such fused multiple sensor information, advanced VICA will more accurately know the emotion of clients. This enables the long continuation of counseling conversation to give the emotionally distressed persons a deep awareness. \"Sensitive listening\" further requires recognition of body language such as facial expression. AI recognition cloud servers of body language such as facial expressions are used for advanced VICA to more reliably detect clients' emotions or emotional changes on their talk for quality self-awareness. However, for such quality/accurate emotion recognition, it is needed to transmit a large amount of sensor data such as video feeds with less than tens of milliseconds. Thus, advanced VICA expects 5G/6G and the speedy slicing to realize powerful assurance operation inclusive of MEC (Mobile/Multiple Edge Computing) for image recognition.",

Thus, in 4G networks without slicing, the cloud-native speech recognition of VICA has a reliability problem. It is a significant problem, because VICA uses \"sensitive listening\" skills as its counseling methodology [7] . The skill requires sensing or listening to clients' minds through recognizing clients' sayings and their very sensitive emotions with extreme accuracy. Then, it continues conversation or communication to promote clients' reflection towards their self-awareness. Thus, VICA has a serious reliability problem in such speech recognition of AI cloud services. Even though accurate image recognition may help to solve the problem, accurate emotion detection/recognition from such as facial expression is further difficult due to a large amount of image data transmission burden in networks. Such reliability problems of AI recognition Cloud services have to be solved, so that our AI counselor \"VICA\" can be practical in real use. It is important that VICA further guarantee or assure speech recognition accuracy/reliability in Google speech-totext cloud service. To attain this, also using the distributed computing approach, VICA servers more densely collaborate with its clients/terminals. In this case, VICA has another problem of transmission over inter-carriers in the reliability and/or latency of networks if terminals are located far from servers as those in foreign countries. VICA has clients for speech I/O (Input/Output) and servers for AI counseling. Clients composed of PCs (Personal Computers) or mobiles handle speech/image recognition to obtain the input from patients. Servers mainly create responses for counseling from the input. However, for VICA using \"sensitive listening\" type counseling methods, speech recognition quality is fatal. VICA servers must assure it before creating the response for counseling. It is done as follows. (1) VICA terminals send voice data to AI speech recognition Cloud servers in such as Google Clouds. (2) VICA terminals receive the recognized speech text. (3) The text is sent to VICA servers. (4) VICA servers validate the resultant text by perplexity checking, etc. (5) On suspecting the error, they improve by several methods before CRECA generates a response for AI counseling. For example, these methods are various kinds of n-gram (forward, backward and so on) with weighted majority decision [11] . (6) If the error is still suspected, servers send text messages to ask clients (terminals) to redo the speech recognition using Google Cloud. (7) To attain high accuracy, this loop should be repeated until the error is not suspected. Meanwhile, the number of loops is limited, so that the loop stops when elapsed time becomes more than the specified time. The elapsed time is defined as t c (current time)-t1 (input starting time of the current dialogue). The specified time can be adjusted. However, the maximum time is also limited, since too long dialogue response time very often stops the conversation. Thus, the network performance affects the number of loops, which affects the quality of speech recognition service. Thus, an ultra-reliable low-latency network such as that of 5G with slicing is required. The next section shows these network requirements.",

Body language understanding is done by multiple sensor fusion, though the results are the text or sign indicating the feeling, such as negative, neutral, or just a bit more positive, and positive. If they utter their emotion by speech directly, advanced VICA can integrate it through the emotional word dictionary. Such integration enables ultra-reliable \"sensitive listening\". This is indispensable for VICA. Emotionally distressed or anxious persons can continue the empathetic less-intrusive confession-like conversation. Their emotional change detected by utterance (speech) or body language (facial expression) is notified by VICA. This promotes their reflection towards self-awareness. Advanced VICA (advanced version of VICA) makes full use of 5G/6G networks.

Namely, network configuration or slicing is set initially when users selected the service level (catalogue menu) of the AI counseling application VICA. Depending on the social situation including the number of patients and the minister's public requests on the pandemic, the slicing (network resource allocation) is done dynamically and automatically. It can be done proactively beforehand though possibly in 5G/6G or in the future. This is because it takes too much time to finish such slicing especially when it is done manually. More dynamically, the AI terminal of VICA monitors the delay in real time and sends it to the AI server of VICA. The VICA server at the EA domain reports the overall delaying situation of each emergent level to service providers (CSPs). Through the delaying information, NaaS of CSP can change the network resource or its configuration to assure the basic requirement via CRM and BSS/OSS. Furthermore, at this point, 5G facilities are limited or very expensive. Both 5G and automatic network operations are not available for our experiments. To cope with this problem, our 5G validation experiments for 5G use case PoC of VICA simulate the effect of network (slice) operation by substituting the cloud (remote) server with the local server.

Even text transmission delay among VICA client (VICA terminal) and VICA server significantly decrease the effect of 5G (not including transport slice) use if the AI server (VICA server) is set in the city in Japan.

Meanwhile, advanced VICA tries to do this through the fusion of sensor/image data, incorporating real-time closed-loop feedback. To produce emotional words that VICA uses for the creation of counseling responses, the result is integrated with one obtained from the speech recognition of the user utterance. Facial expression recognition is used to evaluate facial cues to interpret and understand the emotional state of patients, including emotions such as anger, fear, happy, or sad to assist in providing proper assistance. As to this, we have the first version of facial expression detection for mental stress. Sad feelings to indicate anxiety and happy feelings to indicate \"clear up\" or \"fine\" (\"solved\" or \"self-aware\") are detected though a bit too simplified as the beginning attempt. Defining the former as a negative feeling and the latter as a positive feeling, for example, the change is detected in the feeling during the consultation. The change of emotion is very important for VICA to let patients reflect towards selfawareness by saying \"You initially said xxx but now you are saying yyy\". Facial expression detection AI integrated into VICA can learn automatically as well as incrementally by logging the pairs of words (user utterances) and the corresponding facial expression. Using such incrementally learnt/trained face expression detection AI, VICA can recognize emotional change even if patients do not say any emotion words or say them unclearly [14] [15] [16] [17] . If patients do say emotional words, the accuracy of such emotional change recognition is improved by majority decision, etc. As to the improvement by majority decision, extracting continuous facial data to analyze essential features captures vital health signs such as stress level, fitness level, blood temperature, and blood pressure. Integrating this information also, advanced VICA can have another way of emotion recognition in near real time, which contributes to more accurate emotion change detection by majority decision. With the sophisticated algorithm and cloud-nature supreme processing power, the possibility is limitless. These improve the performance (total accuracy or reliability) of VICA.",

They are partly in practical use, though building robust intelligent chat bots such as VICA is still a challenging endeavor.

Basically, it should let clients or patients obtain deep self-awareness by continuing conversation. Thus, it requires aforementioned \"sensitive listening\" ability, that is, high-quality speech recognition or sensing capability, and least mentally distressed persons should become irritated due to recognition error or failure. As described in Sect. 3.1, for users to obtain deep awareness, digging and summarization are also necessary. They are agents' own creating responses for empathy [34] and beyond it, different from Eliza-like simple mirroring. For instance, beyond empathy, it is further necessary for counselors or counseling agents to ask clients the relation between the words they talk repetitively and the meaningful words they used for expressing their wishes or problems. It is further necessary to capture the client's emotion or its change such as negative feeling to positive feeling from the spoken words translated to text. It enables \"sensitive listening\" promoting empathy needed for the continuation of dialogue between counseling agents and emotionally distressed persons. Just mirroring or paraphrasing such as one from input voice to output response is not sufficient for Roger's type counseling. Speech understanding is still necessary. Thus, a text-based counseling agent after translating voice to text by speech recognition servers is considered more effective than a voice-based somewhat mirroring type counseling agent. These results cause multiple or repetitive uses of high-quality cloud-based speech recognition servers along with many kinds of error recovery processing in counseling AI servers. It requires less than milliseconds of network delay among AI terminals and cloud centers as well as between AI terminals and AI servers besides multiple or repetitive use time (often 100 milliseconds each) [11] of speech recognition clouds used from counseling AI terminals and error recovery processing in counseling AI servers.",

As the result, the slice cannot be in time for the sharp drop in network performance. To cope with this, VICA's catalogue approach can select a more proactive approach using social intelligence concerning such as disaster and pandemic 8 . It can allocate more network resources in time for even the sharp drop of network performance also, though its reliability depends on that of the social intelligence as well as the quantity and quality of marginal resources.",

However, it still has a problem of the (speech recognition) algorithm accuracy with lower time complexity (little delay) for the intelligent algorithm that the data cognitive engine currently utilizes.

These include word dropping, delayed response, and the occasional connection fails. Thus, VICA caused significant quality problems of conversation discontinuity despite promising voice communication interfaces. We attempted to solve this problem by leveraging a 5G/6G slice inclusive of MEC and devising an enhanced VICA containing collaborating servers with the aim of increasing speech recognition reliability. However, issues such as network latency among inter-carriers and overwhelming data rate during emergency situations emerged. Hence, for better quality communication with clients and for recognizing facial expressions, advanced VICA has been designed. We proposed a quality assurance mechanism based on multiple levels of catalog using a 5G/6G slice inclusive of MEC. Our experiments revealed that the number of speech recognition errors of Internet Cloud was more than double when compared with that of edge computing. Such results show that quality assurance using 5G/6G is necessary and has increased efficiency when used with VICA Counseling (ro)bot. Image recognition AI or sensor fusion AI could be crucial for more accurate recognition of patients' feelings exhibited by body language such as facial expressions. In the near future, experiments for video data transportation will be conducted. These experiments will aim to analyze and unveil the effects/problems of 5G for quality counseling bot/robot, as well as to improve 5G towards future network standards such as 6G.",

A data rate of around 10-100 Mbps is required between the AI terminal and AI server when 10-100K persons are using VICA concurrently during emergencies. 2. Requirement for voice (including tone, majority decision for quality improvement): network delay should be 5-10 ms. Speech conversation interval totally permits a second. Speech recognition in cloud sometimes takes a second. It may be a problem. Thus, rather, much lower degree of a second should be necessary. Data rate should be 15-100 Gbps upstreaming to Google speech-to-text cloud espe-",
