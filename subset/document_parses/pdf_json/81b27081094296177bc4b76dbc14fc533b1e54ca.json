This is possible to happen due to restriction measures applied during the evolution of an epidemic. Regardless of the number of terms used, the obtained parameters must be well understood, in the sense of their role in the problem. Let us consider a country where the disease starts to outbreak due to a small number of infected individuals. In this stage we assume that the country has been isolated in a relatively high degree, but of course not ideally. At this point, the disease starts with a transmission rate which depends on the dynamics of the spread in each city and village, while other inherent properties of the disease affect its dynamics (e.g. the immune reaction, the incubation time and recovering time). At this point, we must clarify also the issue of the \"size\" of the epidemic. The SIR-based models assume that the size, N, that is the total number of individuals exposable to the disease is unchanged during its evolution, a fact which cannot be exactly true. On the other hand, a fraction of the size concerns individuals who are in quarantine for different reasons (due to tracing or for precautionary reasons). Therefore, the size cannot be absolutely constant and the forecasting at the first stage (during the growing of the epidemic) should be very uncertain. In the second stage (around the turning point), the situation is more clear by means of more accurate parametrization, although high fluctuations could still be present. At the third stage (mitigation or suppress), an overall parametrization can be made and any trial for forecasting concerns a likely future comeback of the epidemic. In any of the three stages regardless of the level of uncertainties the parametrization specifies the associated parameters according to the epidemic model used. It is known that the \"basic reproductive number\" symbolized by R 0 is a very important parameter of the spreading of the epidemic. In the SIR-based models it is determined at the first moments of the epidemic (mathematically at t = 0) and is related to the associated parameters.

Another important finding of our study was a strong anti-correlation, statistically significant, of the basic reproductive number and the peaking time. Moreover, we found that the basic reproductive number in the epidemics studied showed a uniform distribution with a wide range of values.
