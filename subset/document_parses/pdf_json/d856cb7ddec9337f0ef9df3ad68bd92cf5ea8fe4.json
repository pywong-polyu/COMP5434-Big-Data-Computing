Therefore, convenience food is becoming ever more important [2] . In Germany, sales turnover of ready meals and soups increased constantly throughout the last years from 6.3 million euros in 2012 to 7.3 million euros in 2019, and peaked with 8.6 million euros in 2020, due to the Covid-19 pandemic [3] . With this increasing demand for convenience food, food processors have developed new food processing technologies to improve microbiological safety, taste, and shelf life [4] [5] [6] [7] However, consumers are sceptical towards processed and convenience food and supposedly new technologies as they are often perceived as unhealthy, unsustainable, and unnatural [2, [7] [8] [9] [10] .",

According to B\u00d6LN [12] , 78% of German consumers buy organic products at least occasionally whereas only 22% never consume organic products. Organic foods are often perceived as more natural than conventional products, and for many consumers, the naturalness of a food product is a key quality attribute, both for primary production and processing [10] . There is the desire for convenience on the one hand and for pure and natural foods on the other hand, challenging food processors to develop adequate food processing technologies [13, 14] . This holds true especially for organic consumers, since they tend to prefer traditional and natural processing technologies [15] , but they also increasingly demand organic convenience food [16] .",

It can help food processors to develop adequate technologies and reduce the risk of losing market shares if consumers do not accept their technologies. In particular, this study investigates consumers' knowledge, expectations, and attitudes towards selected processing technologies for organic food based on the following research questions: 'What do consumers know about (organic) food processing?', 'What do consumers expect from organic processing?', and 'Which of the presented processing technologies do consumers prefer for organic food?'.

Asioli et al. [21] compared air drying (thermal) with microwave drying (non-thermal) for organic strawberries. Consumers who cared about organic, natural, and environmentally friendly products were particularly sceptical of new technologies and therefore preferred traditional air drying.

Thus, organic consumers seem to perceive risks and benefits as well as naturalness more sensitively while preferring traditional processing technologies [15] .",

The standards of the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), define organic processing as making use of biological, mechanical, and physical processes, keeping the 'true nature' of the product and ensuring sustainability for the environment [32] . That means there are some clear guidelines that must be followed and there are concepts, such as 'careful processing', that should be considered when processing organic food.

Attitudes are formed over time and can be explained by two complementary approaches: bottom-up and top-down, depending on the knowledge consumers have about a food processing technology [35, 36] . In general, consumer awareness and knowledge of food technologies is low [17, 18, 36, 37] . When costs and benefits are not known, consumers follow higher-order values and fundamental beliefs and hence, a top-down approach. If consumers know benefits and costs of a technology, they decide based on a functional rationality that is bottom-up [36] . Troy et al. [37] found that consumers are often not interested in developing an information-based bottom-up approach for building their attitude towards a new technology. They rather rely on their own perception and hence, on a top-down approach. Similarly, Barcellos et al. [38] found that consumers want information about the benefits of a new technology but no details on what happens inside the processing plant. Siegrist and Hartmann [20] described decision making in the absence of knowledge as the affect heuristic, which is the affective meaning, an association, or narrative people rely on when evaluating a technology. The affect heuristic might also be an important reason why people judge the same technologies differently.",

The FTN scale helped to improve the predictability of consumer behaviour regarding food choices of different highly processed familiar foods [40] . Based on the level of affinity towards new technologies, consumer segments were built. Consumers who were rather sceptical and traditional had concerns that new food processing technologies would negatively impact food naturalness and the environment as well as health and quality of life [41] . Indeed, consumers who had high levels of FTN rated fruit juices more negatively than consumers with low or medium levels of FTN, regardless of whether juices were produced with conventional or new technologies [7] . Consumers who generally tend to have strong environmental and ecological values also tend to have higher levels of FTN. They are more reluctant to try new technologies, although the new technology might be more environmentally friendly [21] .",

For the majority of consumers, naturalness has a positive reputation [20, 25] . This has also been described as the 'naturalis-better' heuristic [20] . Healthier, better tasting, and environmentally friendly were the main positive aspects of the natural-is-better heuristic. These aspects did not only influence consumers' acceptance when evaluating technologies, but also had the potential to bias technology evaluation [18, 20] . Hence, it is important to understand how interventions and technologies influence consumers' perceptions of naturalness. Consumers associated with naturalness the absence of intervention or changes and hence, processing was generally perceived as decreasing naturalness [38, 42] . Chemical changes were assumed to decrease naturalness of a product more than physical changes [42] . Dickson-Spillmann et al. [43] even talked about a 'chemophobia' where consumers deemed something natural as safe and associated something chemical or synthetic with toxic.",

Benefits such as taste, nutritional quality and environmental friendliness seemed to be clear, and exposure to and extent of the technology well manageable [17, 46] . Moreover, Sonne et al. [45] found out that consumers preferred HPP technology due to its high product quality and environmental friendliness and associated it with two important values: health and 'being good to nature'.",

The main barrier to increase acceptance of HPP was lack of information and lack of trust in the food industry [18, 46] . To overcome this, technology information should be communicated via a product label [45] . Here, the main perceived benefits of HPP should be communicated in a direct and easily understandable and traceable way [34] . Summing up, HPP has many benefits which are recognised by the consumer. However, the general knowledge on processing technologies is rather low. Hence, obtaining further insights into risk and benefit perception of HPP for organic products is necessary.",

            "text": "Since little prior research exists regarding consumers and processing technologies of organic food, focus groups (FG) as an explorative method were chosen to collect primary data. FGs are carefully planned discussions with about six to ten participants [47] . The discussions follow a structured but variable set of guiding questions which allows adapting to the natural flow of the discussion [48] . This also means that questions aim to stimulate the discussion rather than asking for specific reasons. This motivates participants to mention the aspects they consider important for the topic at hand and enables the researcher to get the participants' viewpoint [49] . Moreover, the participants can probe each other's responses, which allows the researcher to get deeper insights about participants' reasoning and social interactions [47, 50] . In addition, so-called heterogeneous and ad-hoc groups in which participants meet different socio-economic criteria and do not know each other before the discussion, lead to more lively and controversial discussions [51] . This enables the researcher to get diverse insights into a topic, a wide array of opinions, and a better idea of participants' understanding, also of complex topics [49, 52] . Besides their explorative character, FGs usually create a natural and relaxed atmosphere, reminding participants of an everyday communication situation. This encourages participants to express their honest opinions, enhance mutual learning, and hence allows obtaining rich, content-related, and realistic results [50, 51] . However, if some people are very talkative or have strong opinions, others may remain silent and their opinion is lost. This can push the discussion in a certain direction and can bias the results. Therefore, the moderator should aim to balance these dynamics and ensure that every participant contributes her or his opinion [47] . Usually more than one focus group for each topic under investigation is conducted, ideally until the point of theoretical saturation is reached. This ensures consideration of the entire spectrum of opinions [47] .",

Indeed, when evaluating preservation technologies for milk, the ethical raising of the cows was often more important than the processing of the milk. On the contrary, in the example 'direct juice or juice from concentrate', consumers followed a rational bottom-up approach (see also Scholderer and Frewer [35] ), evaluating the technologies based on functional characteristics, such as number of processing steps, and perception of nutritional quality.

In this study, complexity of evaluating processing technologies for organic foods was often reduced to 'natural-is-better', 'fewer ingredients', and 'fewer processing steps'. This became clear when comparing the preferences for juice from concentrate and direct juice. Most participants preferred direct juice as a processing technology for organic food. The fewer processing steps, the taste, and the nutritional quality increased the perception of naturalness compared to juice from concentrate. For the latter, lower perceived nutritional quality and the many processing steps reduced participants' naturalness perception. Here, the natural-is-better heuristic [20] may have led participants to the preference of direct organic orange juice. However, some saw the transportation of concentrate as a benefit for the environment and also preferred organic juice from concentrate.",

Higher levels of FTN lead to non-acceptance of both traditional and new technologies, as was found by Martins et al. [7] . Indeed, in this study, some critical organic consumers were identified and seemed to have an aversion towards processed organic food in general and towards new processing technologies in particular. These consumers did not perceive any benefits of processing beyond the minimum requirements and strongly valued natural and unprocessed organic products and traditional and familiar processing technologies. For them, the processing of organic foods was mainly associated with risks, such as loss of naturalness, loss of nutritional value, and negative health and environmental impacts, which was also found by Sajdakowska et al. [41] , yet studying conventional products. Accepted technologies for organic processing were homogenisation and pasteurisation, where risk perception was rather low, benefits were clear and the technologies traditional and familiar (see also Barcellos et al.

They may also have strong ecological and environmental values [62] , but compared to the critical consumers, they valued some benefits of processed organic foods and new processing technologies. These were increased shelf life, nutritional quality and health, naturalness, and potentially low environmental impact. The perceived risks were negative environmental impacts or packaging of products. Rather than fearing risks, these consumers often faced a trade-off between convenience and quality. For example, as an alternative to UHT milk, microfiltrated ESL milk was perceived as more natural since nutrients and a fresh taste were retained. For these consumers, microfiltration qualifies as a careful or more natural processing technology compared to UHT and thus, as a quality indicator for organic processing. As an alternative to pasteurised milk, the benefits of a longer shelf life and hence, increased convenience and potentially less food waste, outweigh the 'risks' of decreased naturalness and nutritional quality. Similarly, comparing HPP to pasteurised juice, benefits were a fresher taste, and a higher level of nutrients, which led to a higher level of perceived naturalness [45, 46] . Consumers who compared HPP to fresh juice, appreciated the longer shelf life and associated it with the reduction of food waste [34] .",

Since naturalness is closely related to organic food [25, 26] , this aspect becomes even more relevant for the evaluation of processing technologies for organic foods. Organic food should be processed 'without additives' if possible or contain 'as little of something as possible'. Similarly, Rom\u00e1n et al. [10] found that consumers associated 'natural food' with 'no additives' or 'unprocessed'. Concerning the risk of losing naturalness, homogenisation as a mere physical treatment was accepted for organic milk as it seemed to decrease naturalness less than chemical changes do; this was also found by Rozin et al. [42] . Microfiltration as a processing technology for organic ESL milk was perceived to be too processed and unnatural and hence, not acceptable for organic processing by critical organic consumers. The same holds true for organic HPP-treated orange juice. The participants compared HPP to fresh juice and perceived the latter as more natural and careful than HPP and saw the higher processing level as a risk to the nutritional value. Moreover, other authors found that the naturalness perception of HPP [7] or generally non-thermal technologies [34] decreases when compared to fresh or cold pressed juices. Another reason might be consumers' increasing interest in healthy foods, and thus their general aversion towards processed juices [13] .",
