Methods: This cross-sectional study enrolled patients who tested positive for COVID-19 with PCR via nasopharyngeal swabs. Conjunctival swabs were collected for each patient and subjected to RT-PCR assay. Demographic data and clinical history of patients were investigated and analysed. Results: In this study, 4.9% of the patients tested positive with conjunctival swabs for COVID-19; 29.9%, 28.7%, 20.1%, and 12.2% of the patients had fever, shortness of breath, cough, and red eye, respectively. Among all patients, 18.9% and 73.2% had a history of traveling and contact with positive COVID-19 cases, respectively. There were significant correlations between the conjunctival results and diabetes (P=0.049) and hypertension (P=0.002). Traveling was a risk factor for positive conjunctival swab testing (P=0.016). The sensitivity of the conjunctival swab was 4.8%. Conclusion: Among all positive cases of COVID-19, a small percentage had positive results when tested using a conjunctival swab. Conjunctival swabs have very low sensitivity for the detection of COVID-19. However, tears could still be a mode of disease transmission, especially from patients to eye care specialists.",

            "text": "In December 2019, China reported a pneumonia outbreak in Wuhan, a city with more than 11 million people, where a local ophthalmologist reported preliminary cases. 1 Over 55 million people have since been affected in over 210 countries, with over 1.33 million fatalities. The disease represents a global challenge due to limitations in therapeutic options and limited vaccine availability to date. 2 Individuals infected with COVID-19 can release several respiratory droplets and microscopic particles (bioaerosols) via breath, coughs, sneezes, or speech. These droplets contact the host's ocular and extra-ocular mucus membranes. The virus particle gains entry into the body through interaction with an epithelial cell using its SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, which binds to the cell membrane protein angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). 3, 4 Fever, headache, cough, shortness of breath, diarrhoea, loss of smell and taste, and malaise are the main symptoms of COVID-19 infection; however, asymptomatic infections have increasingly been reported among populations screened for the disease. 5 Ocular symptoms range from mild conjunctival injection to acute anterior and posterior uveitis, retinitis, and optic neuritis. The role of the ocular surface as a source of transmission and retrograde transmission has been investigated in several studies and remains an unresolved issue. 6, 7 COVID-19 can be transferred through mucous membranes, including the conjunctiva, according to Lu et al. Many cases have been reported in which ophthalmologists were discovered to be infected during normal diagnosis and treatment. 8 Given that the virus is present in patients' body fluids, tear fluid is a form of bodily fluid, and SARS-CoV=2 is comparable to SARSCoV, it is possible that tear and conjunctival transmission could occur. 9 It is debatable whether the virus is present within tears. Xia et al found the presence of COVID-19 within tear film in only one patient with conjunctivitis among persons infected with SARS-CoV-2, using real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays. 9 Seah et al, on the other hand, proposed a low risk of ocular transmission because neither viral culture nor reverse transcription were able to detect viral particles in their tested samples. 10 Our study aimed to assess the presence of viral RNA within the ocular surface in patients confirmed by pharyngeal swabs to be infected with COVID-19.",

            "text": "COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that replicates in the upper respiratory system, making it the primary port of entry and site of infection. 3 It was reported that the ocular surface could also act as an entry pathway for COVID-19 and that ocular discharges could play a role in the shedding of the virus. 3 Several reports have suggested that the eyes can be affected at any stage of the disease. [11] [12] [13] A review article stated that positive COVID-19 results in eye specimens were found with a low incidence. 14 A study from China investigated the presence of COVID-19 in the tears and conjunctival secretions of 30 patients with COVID-19. The study revealed that only two samples of conjunctival secretions and tears were positive for COVID-19, whereas the other samples were negative. The authors suggested that COVID-19 might be detected in conjunctival secretions and tears. However, its incidence is low. 9 Xia et al analyzed the conjunctival samples of 30 infected patients for SARSCoV-2 RNA, and one patient's conjunctival samples were positive for the virus 3 days later. 9 Seah et al, on the other hand, found no evidence of SARS-CoV-2 shedding in tears during the disease's course, implying a low risk of ocular transmission. 10 Conjunctival sampling, according to Chen et al may not A study from Egypt was conducted to evaluate the incidence of COVID-19 in the tears and conjunctival secretions of patients with confirmed COVID-19. The study reported that COVID-19 was found in the secretions of 28.57% of the patients, whereas the majority showed negative results. 16 A study from India by Kumar et al 17 was conducted for the same purpose as the previous two studies by Xia et al and Mahmoud et al. 9, 16 The Indian study included 45 COVID-19 patients who underwent conjunctival swabs for the RT-PCR assay. The study revealed that only 17 Another study enrolled 46 patients confirmed with COVID-19 through the nasopharyngeal swab; only 8.2% of them were found to be COVID-19 positive using conjunctival swabs. 18 We are unaware of any previous study conducted in Saudi Arabia populations that has investigated the role of conjunctival swabs in detecting COVID-19 cases; therefore, we conducted this study. In this study, only 4.9% of the patients had positive COVID-19 results using conjunctival swabs for RT-PCR assay, although all patients were positive for COVID-19 as found by nasopharyngeal swabs. The findings of this study were in agreement with those of previous studies. 9, [16] [17] [18] Several demographics and clinical characteristics of patients were investigated to assess whether any clinical characteristics or patient history data could be associated with the positive results obtained with a conjunctival swab. Our study comprised more male participants than females, and the majority of the patients were nonsmokers. A few patients experienced fever, SOB, cough, and red eyes. However, none of these factors was significantly associated with the conjunctival swab results.",

            "text": "Previous studies have found that patients' ocular symptoms can be modest and self-healing, therefore many COVID-19 patients may not bother to report them. As a result, symptoms may appear in either the early or late stages of the disease. 13, 14 In relation to chronic diseases, a very small percentage of our sample had DM, HT, or asthma. Only DM and HT were found to significantly affect conjunctival swab findings. A history of travel was not common, whereas a large percentage of patients reported contact with COVID-19 cases. However, those who reported recent traveling history (outside Saudi Arabia) were more likely to show positive results through the conjunctival swab. Hence, traveling from area with high-infected cases with COVID-19 is a risk factor for a positive conjunctival swab test results. That is why, in patients with recent travel who report with acute conjunctivitis, COVID-19 should be considered as one of the differential diagnosis as recommended by previous studies. 19, 20 Similarly, one of the previews study reported that fever, cough, and conjunctivitis were prevalent among a few patients with confirmed COVID-19. Either those with positive COVID-19 conjunctival secretions were with or without conjunctivitis; therefore, conjunctivitis had no association with the conjunctival swab results. 16 Positive conjunctival swab samples were found in 3/ 121 patients by Zhou et al two of whom did not exhibit ocular symptoms. 13 SARSCoV-2 RNA was found in conjunctival specimens of 2/27 COVID-19 patients without conjunctivitis, according to Ye et al. 21 Hu et al described a 70-year-old COVID-19 patient who had a history of common lacrimal duct obstruction in his left eye but no conjunctivitis. 22 Although many other studies have reported the incidence of COVID-19 RNA in conjunctival swabs. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity of such swabs and found that the sensitivity was only 4.8%. In contrast, the specificity could not be calculated owing to the findings from the samples. This finding agrees with a meta-analysis study that concludes very low sensitivity of conjunctival swabs in comparison to pharyngeal one (Ulhaq and Soraya, 0.2020). 23 Generally, the significant rate finding of the COVID-19 RNA in the conjunctival swabs could be due to some reasons as the low sensitivity of the test. Detecting the virus from conjunctive due to viral load in the eye not reach the minimum threshold to be detected as in positive patients confirmed through nasopharyngeal swabs. 14,24 It is possible the viruses appear for short period in the eye, which may need specific and precise collection time. 9, 15, 25 Telemedicine sorted some issues of patient management but it is considers limited in eye care due to the service nature. Even with considers reducing and limited number of patients visiting eye care centres still there are a lot of patients need face-to-face clinical care. 26 Those patients visiting eye care centres, if they are infected, can release a bio-aerosol droplets when they are sneezing or coughing or talking if they are not using masks. Safety of the eye care provider is very important and that is considered implemented in full PPE. Eye care provider considers to be more supposed to be infected with coronaviruses due to close contact to the patients during daily work activities and surgical procedures. Slit-lamp breath shields, hand, hygiene, facial masks, reducing patients talking when he is under examination, use of eye protection and considers disinfected all the equipment between the patients are very crucial in reduce corona viruses transmissions. 27, 28 Even if our study was not supporting the presence of corona viruses in the eye, it is still important to consider patient visit to the eye care centres as the source of infection and disease spared.",
