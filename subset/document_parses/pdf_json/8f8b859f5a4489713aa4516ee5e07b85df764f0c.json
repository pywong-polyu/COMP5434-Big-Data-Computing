The notice on improving the Prevention and Control of Infection in Fever Outpatient and Medical Institutions issued by the Chinese National Health Commission stated that \"three areas and two channels\" must be established to deal with outpatients, requiring separation of areas into polluted, semi-polluted and clean areas, plus separate channels for medical personnel and patients 8 . GD2H set up outpatient services for patients with a fever in strict accordance with these requirements, providing a one-stop service area integrating registration, payment, waiting, specimen collection, examination, and other functions, such as consulting-related services. This enables patients to complete the whole visit, from registration to examination, in a single area. Test results and reports are transmitted to patients' smartphones in real time using the app DingBei Doctor, developed by GD2H. From June 30, 2020 to June 30, 2021, 243,694 people registered on the hospital's WeChat public platform, and 962,464 payments were made. This reduces the movement of patients within the hospital and the number of trips required to the hospital, reducing contact opportunities between patients in high-risk areas.",

            "text": "Effective management and protection of inpatients is also required to reduce nosocomial infections 9 . GD2H uses semi-active Radio Frequency Identification technology, which makes objects and personnel uniquely identifiable as virtual representations in an internet-like structure (the Internet of Things). This enables a virtual electronic fence to be established around a pre-set security area (inpatient activity area). When patients leave the security area set by the system, or unauthorized persons enter the area, the system alarm is triggered. In parallel, the whereabouts of personnel in the hospital can be traced using face recognition software. A virtual reality (VR) system enables a patient's family to visit remotely. When the patient's family enters the visiting room, the doctor informs the ward nurse who puts a smart trolley at the bedside of the patient being visited. The smart trolley is equipped with camera, computer, microphone, and speaker. The family can wear VR glasses to watch the patient in the ward, and the doctor can explain the patient's condition to the family simultaneously. Medical staff can also use mobile phones to undertake remote ward rounds at any time and anywhere using the VR system. This minimizes contact between doctors, patients, and their families within the ward. AI-driven robots or AI-assisted equipment further reduce contact between patients and hospital staff, reducing the direct exposure of medical personnel to highly infectious environments 10 . For example, GD2H uses robot disinfection and drug delivery in highrisk areas such as isolation wards and wards containing patients with COVID-19. A disinfection robot is a disinfection machine that integrates ultraviolet disinfection, ultra-dry fog hydrogen peroxide sterilization, and air filtration. Using the 5G network and laser navigation technology, the robot moves autonomously according to the set route, and automatically carries out regular and thorough disinfection in complex environments, ensuring all areas are appropriately disinfected. The drug delivery robot automatically arrives at the bedside of the patient according to the bed number set by the nurse. A smart health watch worn by the patient ensures each patient can only access their medicine.",

            "text": "By utilizing 5G, AI, and the Internet of Things, GD2H has implemented early intervention, active monitoring, and wholeprocess tracking to reduce the potential risk of nosocomial infection and better control any occurrences. Whilst these technologies were implemented prior to the COVID 19 pandemic, the pandemic has enabled their utility to be demonstrated. Using hospital monitoring data, it was found that as of June 30, 2020, GD2H, as a provincial emergency hospital, had admitted 52 confirmed cases of COVID-19, >1300 suspected cases, and had been visited by patients with fever >68,000 times, during which time no nosocomial infection was detected. In contrast, a news report from the Health Times reported that nosocomial infection occurred in >10 hospitals lacking this technology across China including in Beijing, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Liaoning, and Shandong 15 . We hypothesize that the absence of nosocomial infections at GD2H was due to the implementation of the technologies we describe here. There are challenges to integrating modern technology into hospitals, including training, the dependence of the HCWs on the system, data security, and privacy protection 7 . Nevertheless, we anticipate that the use of 5G and AI in conjunction with the Internet of Things will enable wider control of nosocomial infection as well as improved monitoring, tracking, and faster feedback of any wider impact of such infections. In the future, it is hoped that 5G technology will be further popularized and AI algorithms will be optimized to promote the integration of information technology into medical practice. ",
