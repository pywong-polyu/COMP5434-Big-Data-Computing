All seven kits detected all sample pools with low C t values (<30); while testing weak positive pooled samples with high C t value (>30); the TRUPCR Kit, TaqPath Kit, Allplex Assay, and BGI RT-PCR kit showed 100% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. However, the Fosun kit, LabGun Kit, and Patho detect kit could detect only 90%, 85%, and 75% of weakly positive samples, respectively. We conclude that all seven commercially available RT-PCR kits included in this study can be used for routine molecular diagnosis of COVID-19. However, regarding performing pooled sample testing, it might be advisable to use those kits that performed best regarding positive identification in samples' pool, that is TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit, TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit, Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay, and BGI Real-time RT-PCR kit for detecting SARS CoV-2.",

Many countries are experiencing acute shortages of diagnostic kits and manufacturers of molecular testing kits and consumables are also struggling to keep with the demand. It has become important to come up with novel ideas to conserve the reagents used for molecular tests. However, at the same time, the disease is new it is important to validate modifications to the testing protocol before universal adoption.",

Similarly, negative sample pools were also created. The pooled 300 \u03bcl VTM was used as starting material for RNA extraction and nucleic acid extraction was performed on each pool using viral nucleic acid extraction by a chemagic Viral DNA/RNA Kit on a che-magic\u2122 360 instrument (Perkin Elmar). Finally, 100 \u03bcl of RNA was eluted and the same RNA was used in further experiments. The study protocol was designed in such a way that the positive sample with a low cut-off threshold (C t value < 30) and high C t value (>30) were included. All RT-PCR tests were performed using RNA extracted from pooled samples on an Applied biosystem 7500 Real-Time PCR system and thermocycling settings and results interpretation was performed as per manufacturer's instructions. 3 | RESULTS A total of 500 samples were tested for SARS Cov-2. Sixty samples were positive and the rest negative; we retested all positive and 10 negative samples in triplicate and finally 40 positive samples and 10 negative samples were selected for the study. Twenty positive samples had high viral loads with a low cut-off threshold (<30) and twenty samples had low viral loads with a high C t value (>30). The selected 50 samples were tested by RT-PCR for SARS CoV-2 by using seven commercial kits. All seven commercially RT-PCR kits could correctly identify 40 positive and 10 negative samples, as a weak positive sample with a cut of threshold in the range of 35-38 was also detected by these kits, it can be safely concluded that they can be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19. All seven commercial kits were evaluated with 40 positive and 10 negative sample pools in duplicate. Results showed that all kits performed well when strongly positive samples were tested and all seven kits detected all sample pools with low C t value (<30). When testing weak positive pooled samples (C t value > 30), TRUPCR Kit, TaqPath Kit, Allplex Assay, and BGI RT-PCR kit showed 100% sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. (",

            "text": "WHO has further emphasized that an urgent increase in laboratory testing, isolation, and contact tracing should be the backbone of the pandemic control strategy.4 Accurate and timely results are important for decision making during this current outbreak, both in the inpatient and OPD settings. For patients admitted to the hospital, the results are critical for medical management, patient cohorting and infection control measures. Likewise, the results are also very important in the outpatient setting; as community prevalence data and identification of disease hot spots help the decision-makers to form the basis for social distancing, the lockdown of infected areas, and a disease combating strategy.13 A short turnaround time of COVID-19 test reports is also critical for judicious use of limited resources, such as the availability of holding area beds, isolation rooms, and real-time cohorting decisions. In addition, timely test results are required to ensure the safety of healthcare workers and minimize their exposure as levels of personal protective equipment required by healthcare professionals also vary depending on whether a patient is COVID-19 positive or negative. 14 The recommended test for diagnosis of COVID-19 is RT-PCR, and to conduct this test, a fully functional molecular laboratory is required equipped with specialized equipment like biosafety cabinets, automated RNA extractors, a Real-time PCR machine, and trained manpower to process the samples while ensuring biosafety and biosecurity. It is difficult to set up a new molecular testing laboratory in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic and increasing the testing capacity of the existing laboratory by sample pooling strategy is a practical solution. 15 The pandemic reached India in March 2020 and the testing capacity of the nation was less than 5000 samples/ day. On 13.04.2020, WHO in collaboration with the Indian Council Of Medical Research, New Delhi issued an advisory recommending pool testing of five-sample pools in an area where COVID-19 prevalence is <5%. 16 With time the molecular laboratory network in India has been strengthened and using the sample pooling strategy currently 110,000 samples are tested every day and to date, 60 million samples have been tested with 5 million COVID-19 positive cases. 17 Sample polling conserves PCR Kits and consumables and significantly decreases manpower requirement. At our center, we have performed 300,000 COVID-19 RT-PCR to date and data suggest that five-sample pooling saves 55% reagents and increases the testing capacity 2.5 times using the same infrastructure and manpower (unpublished data). Currently, there is no literature on the evaluation of the efficacy of various commercially available Real-Time PCR kits for pool sample testing, thus this study was planned to compare and evaluate seven commercially available RT-PCR kits for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 in clinical sample pools. We compared the kits by performing testing using the same quantified RNA; thus, allowing parallel evaluation. All seven RT-PCR kits evaluated in this study could correctly identify all 40 positives and 10 negative samples, including a weak positive sample. A similar study evaluated the clinical performance of selected RT-PCR kits from seven different manufacturers-Altona Diagnostics, BGI, CerTest Biotec, KH Medical, Primer Design, R-Biopharm AG, and Seegene and PCR efficiency was found to be \u226596% for all assays and the authors concluded that all tested RT-PCR in the study may be used for routine diagnostics of COVID-19 in patients by experienced molecular diagnostic laboratories. 18 In another study evaluating the diagnostic performance of RT-PCR kits provided with emergency use authorization by US-FDA, the New York SARS-CoV-2 Real-time PCR Diagnostic Panel (modified CDC)",

Further unpublished data from our centre suggest that less then <2% of our RT-PCR-positive samples had C t value > 37, and by following the above-mentioned precautions, we picked the maximum possible positive cases.",

In a study on evaluation of RT-PCR for pool testing using the Seegene Allplex2019 nCoV assay, the authors pooled up to 32 samples and reported that the kit could detect all positive samples and concluded that using standard protocols sample pooling can be applied immediately in current clinical testing laboratories. 15 In another study on pool sample testing, the authors performed pool testing using a Real Star SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR Kit (Altona Diagnostics) and suggested that pooling of up to 30 samples per pool can increase test capacity with existing equipment and test kits and detects positive samples with sufficient diagnostic accuracy. 20 This study results show higher analytical sensitivities, specificity, and accuracy of the TRUPCR SARS-CoV-2 Kit, TaqPath RT-PCR COVID-19 Kit, Allplex 2019-nCOV Assay, and Real-time Fluorescent RT-PCR kit for detecting SARS CoV-2 (BGI) assays when compared to the FOSUN COVID-19 RT-PCR detection kit, LabGun COVID-19 RT-PCR Kit and Patho detect COVID-19 qualitative PCR kit assays.
