Male first-year medical students experienced higher rates of depression compared to their third-year counterparts. Most students exhibited coping strategies that helped them feel less depressed. The 3 most common coping strategies reported were: reaching out to social support networks, physical activity/exercise, and engaging in hobbies.",

Recognizing that examinations can be a trigger of depressive symptoms in medical students, particularly female and first-year students, has important implications on student mental health. Helping students recognize these symptoms and employ healthy coping strategies may further help alleviate these symptoms. Long-term consequences of experiencing symptoms of depression after recurrent exams in medical school are unknown and require further research.",

            "text": "Estimates vary, but well over a quarter of all medical students experience depression during their medical training. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] Additionally, around half of all medical students experience symptoms of distress or burnout, defined as \"work-related syndrome involving emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and a sense of reduced personal accomplishment\" 7 at some point during their education. 1, [8] [9] [10] Burnout is often associated with depression or psychiatric illness and in recent years has been noted to be a global phenomenon affecting students and health care providers alike. Therefore, student mental health is an important and pertinent topic of research and discussion, to identify triggers of destabilization and thus combat both mental illness and burnout in our future health care providers. 1, 7, 8 Multiple studies show that medical students experience higher rates of depression compared to the general population, [11] [12] [13] [14] with gender being a major factor that impacts depressive symptoms. 3, [15] [16] [17] However, the true incidence of depression in medical students compared to the general population remains unknown, as some studies show conflicting data, where medical students were found not to have higher rates of depression compared to students studying business or humanities. [18] [19] [20] The relationship between gender and depression in medical students is also mixed with some data supporting that female medical students experience more depression, 5, 13, [21] [22] [23] [24] while other studies find no difference in symptoms between genders. 6, 25, 26 Most of the above-cited studies are cross-sectional and look at depression at 1 point in time in medical school. This makes it challenging to find the true incidence as many different factors, including life stressors, can impact a student's emotions. The topic of depression in medical students is further complicated as the above-cited studies are taken from multiple different countries. Not only do different cultures likely play a role in the development of symptoms of depression, but in countries outside the USA, medical education often begins immediately after high school, whereas in the USA medical school begins after at least an undergraduate education has already been completed. Additionally, most studies compare medical students to students in other professions, not individuals who are nonstudents, adding to the complexity of this topic. Regardless, across most studies, alarmingly high rates of depressive symptomatology were found in medical students. Understanding precipitating factors and identifying methods to alleviate the mental burden endured by our future health care providers is both timely and imperative.",

            "text": "As of 2019, 17.3 million Americans (7.1% of the population) suffer from major depressive disorder (MDD). 27 According to the National Institute of Mental Health, female adults suffer from MDD at higher rates (8.7%) than their male counterparts (5.3%), and adults aged 18 to 25 years make up the largest group of individuals diagnosed with MDD at 13.1%. 28 These findings were confirmed by many other studies. [29] [30] [31] Notably, the median age of female and male adults entering medical school is 23 and 24 years old, respectively, with both genders falling into the age group most vulnerable to developing symptoms of MDD. 32 Yet, other data suggests that the emergence of depressive symptoms in medical students is not affected by age. 15 Whether or not medical students develop these symptoms because of their age or other factors surrounding being in medical school is not known. Having a diagnosis of MDD as a medical student was found to be an independent predictor of burnout later in training, jeopardizing the longevity of future physician's careers and leading to potential job dissatisfaction. 33 Additionally, residents with burnout and depression make statistically more errors compared to their nondepressed peers. 34 These facts highlight the importance of identifying factors contributing to depressive symptoms in medical students and provide an opportunity for early intervention and an integral step in preventing burnout and fostering physician well-being, starting in the formative years of medical education.",

Previous research has shown that medical students use a variety of coping strategies. One study found social supports to be the most popular coping strategy, with substance use having the lowest prevalence. 38 In the current study, the researchers chose to look at positive coping strategies as well as substance use.",

The researchers in this study aimed to look at 1 particular potential trigger of depression symptoms in medical students by examining depressive symptoms of medical students after examinations. There is a notable lack of information regarding student experiences with depressive symptoms after examinations, which is an important factor in understanding how high-intensity examinations relate to student mental health, burnout, and future wellbeing. Understanding the interplay between medical school examinations and depression in medical students is complex. In this study, the authors aimed to assess whether medical students experience symptoms of depression after exams and if there is a difference between male and female students. In doing so, the authors hypothesized that: (1) medical students experience high rates of depressive symptoms after exams; (2) female medical students experience higher rates of depression than their male counterparts; and (3) most medical students use coping mechanisms to deal with such symptoms of depression. Collecting this data is the first step in understanding if medical school exams may be a contributing factor to medical student mental health. Understanding coping mechanisms used by medical students is also important information that could help alleviate depressive symptoms in students.",

The survey was sent to a total of 550 students after medical students received their grades from their most recent exam. The same survey was sent to students after 2 different exam periods, and students were asked to only respond once. This was done to achieve a wider sample size and to allow students who had not responded to the survey after the first exam period to participate in the survey after a second consecutive exam period. The difference between exam periods ranged from 2 to 6 weeks depending on the year in medical school, this was due to the fact that at UNECOM, first-year students are tested the most often, typically in a week-long block exam format, secondyear students are tested less often usually, every 3 to 6 weeks and third-year students are tested the least frequently, every 6 to 12 weeks. All exams were computerized multiple-choice examinations. Exams in the first year are based on material learned in the past 2 weeks in an integrated curriculum, exams in secondyear are summative and given at the end of each body system block, and exams in third-year are standardized across all osteopathic medical schools and given at the end of each core rotation and are specific to the rotation each student is on (COMAT examination). An initial email was sent out immediately after scores were released, and a second email was sent several days later to recruit more participants. Scores were sent out to students within a week of taking the exam. The survey can be found in Table 1 . The survey employed was created by the authors and included all of the criteria for MDD as delineated in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5); DSM-5 criteria were used as this is the criterion used to diagnose MDD in the USA where the medical school in which this study was conducted is located, and therefore would be the criterion for which such students would be diagnosed with MDD by a health care provider. Additionally, the coping strategies assessed in the survey were chosen by the researchers, with question 16 being free-response to allow participants to add additional strategies. A statement of informed consent was presented at the start of the survey. The REDcap platform allowed data collection to be collected anonymously and free of identifiers. The study was approved by the University of New England Institutional Review Board. Incomplete surveys were excluded from the analysis. In this survey, gender was assessed in the context of social construct versus biological sex, as students were asked what gender they \"identify with\" in the survey, not what gender they were assigned at birth. Gender in the social construct versus the biological context was chosen by the authors as they felt this was most representative of the student population. One person reported identifying as nonbinary; because a sample size of 1 was not enough to run statistics on, and due to the potential of identifying this individual in the data set, this survey was excluded from the analysis.",

In the present study, the number of depressive symptoms experienced after exams differed by gender and year in medical school, with females overall experiencing more symptoms of depression compared to males (Figure 1) , and male first-year medical students experiencing more symptoms of depression compared to male third-year medical students ( Figure 2 ). Of note, students in this study tended to have fewer depressive symptoms after exams as they advanced chronologically through medical school. Prior research has shown that medical students as a group tend to become more depressed as they progress 42 ; however, in the present study, depressive symptoms immediately following exams were examined, and not general depressive symptoms in medical students. Further work to investigate if there is a true difference between depressive symptoms after exams versus overall depressive symptoms is warranted.",

While not the full explanation for the development of depressive symptoms in medical students, results from this pilot study show that exams could be a contributing source of such symptoms in medical students, as they are also known to contribute largely to anxiety, 16, 27, 35, 36, 41 which is often linked to depression. 44 A previous study by Thiemann et al 16 showed that medical students with imminent exams were more likely to experience depression; however, symptoms were only looked at before exams and not afterward. The authors suggested that students may require more support during exam periods; that correlates well with this study's finding that students experience symptoms of depression after exams. Overall, the driver of the striking differences between male and female experiences of depression after exams is not fully understood (similar to the drivers behind symptoms in the general population); however, lack of self-esteem, imposter syndrome, or lack of female role models in medicine could be contributing factors. [45] [46] [47] Further work is needed to better understand the etiology of these findings in medical students and the general population alike to find ways to alleviate these symptoms. The authors suspect that there will be overlap between many drivers of symptoms of MDD between medical students and the general population, but also suspect there to be differences given the high stakes surrounding performance-based assessments that medical students' experience, which differs from the general population.",

Recurrent experiences of such symptoms can potentially lead to cumulative negative effects on students' overall well-being and lead to burnout or the development of mental health pathology. Prior studies have Journal of Medical Education and Curricular Development postulated that mental health status can worsen as medical students continue through the continuum of medical education. Therefore, it is reasonable to question whether recurrent highstakes examinations may be contributing to mental health concerns as students' progress through their education. 48 Additionally, in light of recent COVID-19 restrictions on social gatherings, limiting students' coping strategy of using social supports may be compounding depressive symptoms in medical students at this time.",

The findings from this current study highlight the importance of awareness and open discussion about emotions that can be triggered by examinations, with the hope that this will encourage students to seek help early on. With the knowledge that many medical students experience depressive symptoms at some point in their training, 1, 8, [21] [22] [23] 33 incorporation of psychosocial resources or services as part of medical education may reduce the stigma of seeking help and develop a culture where mental well-being is emphasized. Students have cited \"lack of time, lack of confidentiality, the stigma associated with using mental health services, cost, fear of documentation on academic record, and fear of unwanted intervention\" as reasons for not seeking help 49 ; as such, medical students who Table 5 .

Another limitation involved the differing percentages of students from each class year, as well as between male and female participants, who answered the call to the study. A lack of preexamination data for comparison of pre-and postexamination symptoms is a limitation. It is unknown if any of the participants had prior mental health diagnoses, or if they had undergone a recent stressor outside of exams (eg, death of a loved one, breakup, accident, or disease), which could have also spurred symptoms of depression; clearly, it is difficult to account for all the various types of stressors in 1 survey. Additionally, a validated questionnaire was not used in this study, making it challenging to compare to other research. However, employing criteria for the diagnosis of MDD using the DSM-5 provides a good representation of the burden of MDD symptoms in medical students after exams. Another limitation was that the number of coping strategies assessed was limited, and included mostly avoiding strategies. Examining students from multiple medical schools, and potentially multiple countries, would better show what students experience. Despite its limitations, this study supports further research into gender and year in medical school differences in the development of depression symptoms surrounding medical school exams.",
