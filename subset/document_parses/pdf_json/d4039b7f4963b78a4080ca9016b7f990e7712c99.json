For men in an intimate relationship, these symptoms disrupt couples' relationships and intimacy. The symptoms also reduce quality of life for both men and their partners, who are often their primary caregivers. Management of the negative effects of cancer and its treatment is a significantly under-addressed supportive care need for these men and their intimate partners. To address these unmet supportive care needs, our interdisciplinary team developed and pilot tested the usability and feasibility of an evidence-based, couple-focused, tailored eHealth intervention, \"Prostate Cancer Education & Resources for Couples\" (PERC). Based on the adapted stress and coping theoretical framework and developed with stakeholder involvement, PERC aims to improve quality of life for both men and their partners by enhancing their positive appraisals, self-efficacy, social support, and healthy behaviors for symptom management.",

Secondary aim: Test if patients and partners in PERC will report significantly more positive appraisals and higher levels of coping resources at follow-ups than those in the control group. Exploratory aim: Determine if patient race and ethnicity, education, type of treatment, or couples' relationship quality moderate the effects of PERC on patient and partner QOL at follow-ups.",

Approximately 92% of diagnosed men have local or regional disease [2] . They are treated with curable intent (prostatectomy or radiation therapy, with or without hormonal therapy), but they often experience distressing treatment-related urinary, sexual, bowel, and hormonal symptoms (e.g., urinary incontinence and urinary urgency, erectile dysfunction, diarrhea, and hot flashes) that linger for months or years [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . These symptoms also lead to emotional distress, fatigue [8] , pain and sleep disturbance [5, 9] , and reduced quality of life (QOL) [7, 10] , all of which can be addressed by self-management. With an approximately 97.5% 5-year relative survival rate and median age of 66 at diagnosis [11] , men with localized prostate cancer are likely to survive for many years and die from other illnesses [12] [13] [14] [15] .",

Guided by an adapted stress and coping theoretical framework [39, 40] , PERC aims to improve QOL for both men undergoing treatment and their partners by enhancing positive appraisals of illness and boosting self-efficacy, social support from multiple sources, and healthy behaviors for symptom management. PERC uses eHealth technologies to dramatically increase couples' ability to access posttreatment supportive care whenever and wherever they feel comfortable accessing it. We tested the usability and feasibility of PERC and refined PERC in two pilot studies (UNC Cancer Prevention and Control Intervention Research Pilot Grant Award and UNC LCCC Population Sciences Developmental Research Award, PI: Song for both awards) [35] .",

            "text": "Participants can obtain peer and professional support using the online Forum moderated by our trained nurse educator who has extensive knowledge about prostate cancer and experiences working with men with prostate cancer and their families. Participants can also receive professional support by scheduling monthly virtual meetings (and additional meetings as needed) with the educator, either online or via a computer-assisted telephone call. At the meetings, which last 15-30 min, the educator helps couples review their symptoms and management, identifies goals to achieve, reviews the online modules if needed, troubleshoots any technical problems, and encourages couples to use the different components of the PERC program. These meetings consist of PERC orientation (week 1), completion of modules (weeks [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] , and the final session (week 15).",
