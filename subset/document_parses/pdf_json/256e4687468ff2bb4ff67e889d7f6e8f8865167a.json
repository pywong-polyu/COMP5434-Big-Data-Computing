While many claim this policy to be a ''win-win'' strategy for both the employers and the employees, the Covid-19 pandemic has given the industries a valuable opportunity to assess the advantages and challenges of this strategy from a relatively long-term perspective. The remote work-psychological stress relationship is complex, and the current pandemic characterized by uncertainties and crisis atmosphere is making the situation worse. Amid constant changing scenario and prevailing decision fatigue, the objective of this research is twofolded. First, it aims to identify the technostressors impacting IT Professionals in the work from home mode. For this purpose, primary data were collected from 334 IT sector full-time employees and analysed using exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis. Second, derive weight/rank of each techno-stressor using analytical hierarchy process to quantify the relative priority of the technostressors. This method includes both the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the complex problem. Findings revealed ''fear of job loss due to new ICT'' due to highest weightage appears to be the most pressing issue while ''work beyond office hour'' has least weightage. By identifying and prioritizing the type of techno-stressors using the mixed method approach, the present research intends to provide the useful input to decision makers in making wise decisions during Covid-19 pandemic and beyond.",

            "text": "The challenges created by Covid-19 pandemic have impacted the whole economy largely. Based on the prevailing unpredictable situation, flexible working models have been accelerated by the organizations in all over the world. ''Work from home'' (WFH) as a concept of remote working where employees work from their houses, has been adopted by all organizations. Almost all sectors have implemented the work from home policy as a measure to the maximum extent feasible for all activities. This became an important step against Covid-19 to reduce workplace contact. Many organizations switched to teleworking and virtual meetings through video conferencing to adapt and cope up with the current scenario. Working from home may continue even when the economy reopens. Companies in IT sector and financial service have invested in remote work tools as there is no trace of resuming the old way of working. The mode of working is now completely with rapid use of mobile phones, computer technology, e-mail, and collaboration tools. Long commutes have been replaced with zoom and other conference mode of working. The coronavirus pandemic changed the way of business and work system facilitated by smart technologies. According to an article, NASSCOM (The National Association of Software and Services Companies) is working to create new models of working and engagement systems. Though technology with work from home model has facilitated the organizations with positive outcomes such as increase in overall efficiency and production, saving the commute time at the same time it has posed a threat to the wellbeing and motivation of employees resulting in technostress with the more use of it. There are certain challenges with significant changes in the professional and personal life of individuals now. One of the challenges is psychological impact of technology on individuals which is known as ''technostress''. When employees go through a certain level of stress and anxiety, they lose confidence and interest in taking responsibilities, and their performance go down. Stress related to technology at workplaces has been investigated since 1980s, and many studies have addressed this problem for decades. The same problem has gained the researcher's much needed attention during Covid-19 pandemic due to ongoing work from home setting in IT industry all over the world. While organizations are constantly putting efforts to make virtual working mode effective in the current crisis, many people are finding it more stressful with this work-extension technologies. There is a negative impact on the psychological wellbeing of the employees due to this excessive and compulsive use of technologies. ''Technostress''-stress caused by use of technology-leads to fatigue, anxiety, lack of sleep, depression and reduced performance. During this outbreak of Covid-19, IT industry in India has adopted ''work from Home'' as per government's mandate. There are numerous stressors due to information and communication technology at workplaces, and these stressors have been highlighted in many of the studies previously. The gap still exists in the area of technostress, and more is to be explored.",

Ranking of techno-stressors has been done using Analytical hierarchy process that is widely accepted method for multi-criteria decision analysis. This helps the decision support systems in structuring the potential stressors, assess their severity and take remedial action. This result may also provide support to the decision makers in order to assess ongoing or future decisions. For this purpose, four techno-stressors (techno-insecurity, techno-overload, techno-invasion and techno-complexity) originally classified by Tarafdar et al. (2007) and later widely used by the researchers for examining, prioritizing or comparing technology induced stress (Spagnoli et al. 2020) were selected. In this study, these four technostressors dimensions have been included because of their relevance to the present Covid-19 pandemic work settings where these techno-stressors have been highlighted as the more prevalent ones ). The reason for selecting these techno-stressors is guided by the industry experts' opinion as well in addition to the literature survey. During the process, telephonic discussions were held with selected executives of reputed IT organizations, psychologists and university level academicians in order to understand the distressing factors affecting most individuals in the present scenario of work from home.",

            "text": "Use of ITC depends on both a user's attitude towards the using technology and what he/she perceives about the benefits or advantages of using the same (Davis 1989 ). More categorically, perceived usefulness can be explained as the extent to which an individual perceives that utilizing computer technology would lead to more efficiency and productivity. However, some individuals may possess a negative impression of the utility of ICT, still they are required to use it at their workplace. This perceptual subjectivity provokes the attitude to work harder to complete more and more assignments beyond one's capacity (\u00c5 borg and Billing 2003) . The IT requirements also results in almost constant ''connectivity'' with frequent use of e-mail and the phone which demands the employees to be connected and available always. This leads to working beyond office hour where individuals are not able to control working hours, which creates feelings of being stressed out. This is one of the main reasons of dissatisfaction about the work which ultimately causes techno-invasion and triggers negative feelings towards technology (Weil and Rosen 1997) . The techno-stressors related to ICT at the workplaces have been scientifically classified as: techno-overload (pressure to work much faster with extended hours), techno-invasion (constant connectivity causing blur boundary between professional and family life), techno-complexity (feeling of inadequate knowledge and skills related to ICT and pressure to learn and update), techno-insecurity (job insecurity due to new ICT upgradation or new ICT skilled person) and techno-uncertainty (difficulty to match with frequently changing ICT) (Tarafdar et al. 2007 ). Ayyagari et al. (2011) developed the P-E fit model of stress to describe computer-related stress. In sum, all the above-mentioned studies indicated individual's way of interaction with technology and the subjective evaluation of the ICT eventually leads to psychological reaction to ICT. The ICT also leaves individuals in organizations with obsolete skills (Ayyagari et al. 2011 ). The rapid changes in technologies also create a problem of higher level of techno-insecurity. He also stated that the constant changes of technologies have negative impact on the perceptions of individual on the use of ICT as they have a pressure to be updated to face the competition.",

Some specific intrinsic characteristics of IT jobs including frequent changes in the technology, unexpected demand of new skills, and pressing deadlines always create a fear of obsolescence of skills of the users. While organizations foster new IT advancements, the workforce in IT sector is on a learning curve showing reduced productivity (Sethi et al. 1999) . Technological changes resulting in increased job demands have pressurized individuals to acquire new job skills to handle new set of work environment (Sami and Pangannaiah 2006) . In order to complete the tasks, employees are adopting new technologies which creates a scenario of competition with a sense of techno-insecurity. Individuals, who are in the pressure of facing competition with fear of losing jobs, are experiencing more anxiety and frustration. There are many observed impacts of technostress such as lower job commitment, reduction in professional effectiveness, low output, more conflict and isolation and more employee turnover (Igbaria and Siegel 1992) . There is also an impact of technostress creators on employee innovation based on the nature of each creator (Chandra et al. 2019) . This requires an awareness on the adverse effect of technostress and effective measures and also implementation of desired practices and strategies for managing technostress.",

But more attention needs to be paid on the indicators of technostress on employee working from home in detail. The current scenario of lockdown imposed by the widespread coronavirus pandemic has taken this technostress to the next level. Though work from home has reported increased productivity and efficiency during pandemic, there are evidences of IT employees working longer than usual hours, mixing work and family time and facing anxiety and depression. In the light of these speculations, it is vitally important for the employers or decision makers to adopt a systematic approach to analyse the repercussion of technostress on IT professionals and reconsider the proposal of extending work from home postpandemic. As Covid-19 pandemic has emerged as a rare phenomenon, its consequences on mental stress have not been adequately reported. Consequently, in the year 2020-2021 use of data science and mathematical approaches to develop decision support system during pandemic for decision makers has grown extensively (Sardar et al. 2020). Further, Pileggi (2020) has revealed that a systematic approach in which all outcomes (positive, neutral and negative) are taken for evaluation produces accurate results and leads to better decision making. Unlike Chatterjee and Shukla (2020) , the present study applies AHP approach (specifically designed for multi-criteria decision making) to identify and rank the most important factors creating technostress during work from home so that they should be considered while deciding upon the implementation and extension of work from home during and post-lockdown, respectively.",

Using these techno-stressors, substressors were identified under each stressor based once again with EFA, CFA and expert views. Using these techno-stressors and sub-stressors as criteria and sub-criteria for analytic hierarchy process (AHP), weights are derived for each factor and sub-factor and then ranking is assigned. In AHP, weights of the criteria as well as sub-criteria have been derived using eigenvector method (EM) as principal eigenvector captures transitivity to obtain the correct ranking on a ratio scale of the alternatives (Saaty and Hu 1998) .",

But at the same time, WFH is taking a toll on employees' mental health in the form of increased technostress, anxiety, work-overload and inability to separate work from their personal lives, violence, etc. (Piquero et al., 2020) . Psychologists have also claimed that extensive use of ICT has adverse effect on employee's mental health. But, these types of virtual workplace arrangements reduce the employer's overall cost and ensure high connectivity with contractors and other stakeholders as well (Spreitzer et al., 2017) . Consequently, months after the lockdown was relaxed and removed in many countries, a heated debate on extending WFH postpandemic has sparked.

            "text": "Grounded on the above-mentioned fact, the purpose of the present study is twofolded. First, it provides the weighted framework of present techno-stressors prevalent due to WFH policy among IT employees. This will give a practical insight to the policy makers and employers to prioritize these technostress creators and take appropriate measures in order to reduce them. Second, due to the uncertain and vague nature of Covid-19 pandemic AHP methodology which is appropriate for multi-criteria decision making (Abdullah and Najib 2016) has been applied so that the weighted hierarchy model of techno-stressors would help them in designing better post-pandemic work policy. The present result that prioritizing the indicators/factors would help the policy makers and governments to design post-lockdown work strategy. Recent work on technostress by Spagnoli et al. (2020) has highlighted multi-tasking, pressure to acquire new skills, often ICT upgradation, technical glitches and consequent insecurities and threat related (4) Decision to job to be the most prominent technostress creators during pandemic. Our finding shows that ''techno-insecurity'' having weight 0.601 has been perceived as the biggest stressor among employees in IT sector during work from home. In congruence with the findings of Spagnoli et al. (2020) , fear of job loss due to new recruits, frequent ICT system upgrade and pressure to upgrade one's own skills have been important indicators of techno-insecurity. Recent works have extensively reported how WFH has triggered fear of job loss among workforce which is not only because of the pandemic situation but also due to the rapid technological advancements that employees are not able to match up. Our findings are consistent with these evidences. Notably, dimensions like had equal rank in terms of prioritization. That does not mean they are irrelevant or less important. Clearly, in such complex pandemic situation, technostress creators under the dimension ''techno-insecurity'' need immediate attention while others are long-term priorities.",

            "text": "Working from home due to Covid-19 has transformed the whole economy with its industries and jobs. Managers and the policy makers are facing decision fatigue in this pandemic characterized by uncertain and complex nature. In the light of this, this study brings insights to form managerial implications for understanding the emerging phenomenon of the techno-stressors in connection with working from home and take tactical decisions later. Our finding shows that ''fear of job loss due to new ICT'' under the criteria ''techno-insecurity'' has been perceived as the biggest stressor among the employees of IT sector. Techno-insecurity is due to the reason that employees in IT sector feel immense pressure to upgrade their ICT skills to keep their jobs safe. These employees are even worried that new recruits may perform their jobs posing a threat to them. Moreover, the advancement in new ICT is posing the threat employees. Thus our evidence on the reasons associated with technoinsecurity has potentially important implications for the management in IT sector. While advances in technology, skill gap and new recruits are increasing the stress and anxieties among the employees, their effects could be offset by stronger policies in IT organizations. Further, post-pandemic strategy (e.g. WFH) must ensure stability and job security among the employees as a robust Covid-19 containment policy tends to decrease the unemployment rate (Tran et al. 2020) . These policies can include transparency in hiring process, enhancing trust in management, increasing the sense of procedural fairness, raising employees' efforts and achieving greater workforce flexibility. The existing work system in a working from home mode can be restructured and redesigned with appropriate collaboration of technology.",

The managers can use this approach as an investigation tool to explore the degree to which each stressor affects the remote employees and to take necessary actions to deal with technostress in the present scenario. However, It is imperative to note that multi-criteria decision making methods indicates towards the possibility of best answer therefore, it should only be used as decision support tool not as the method to derive final solution. As, the scope of this study was limited to only four out of the five technostressors originally reported by previous researcher, in future, a more detailed and comparative study on technostress can be conducted in other sectors and technostress coping alternatives can also be discussed in greater detail. The findings of this study also guide the future researchers to replicate this study in different context.",
