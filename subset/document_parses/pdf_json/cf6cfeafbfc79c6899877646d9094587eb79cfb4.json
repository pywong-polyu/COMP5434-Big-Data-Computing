Feeling relaxed is an outcome of all the addictions called euphoria; our selection of red wine is based on its anxiolytic effect. Marijuana has been correlated with adverse cardiovascular events, namely tachycardia and possibly MI in people with established heart disease. Red wine has been shown to have beneficial effects on the heart noted above. Therefore, other factors than relaxation may be playing a role in the relationship of marijuana to reduced MI risk we describe here.",
