Although research has shown that artificially synthesized nullomers have deleterious effects, there is still a lack of a strategy for the prioritisation and classification of non-occurring sequences as potentially malicious or benign. In this work, by using Markovian models with multiple-testing correction, we reveal significant absent oligomers which are statistically expected to exist. This strongly suggests that their absence is due to negative selection. We survey genomes and proteomes covering the diversity of life, and find thousands of significant absent sequences. Common significant nullomers are often mono-or dinucleotide tracts, or palindromic. Significant viral nullomers are often restriction sites, and may indicate unknown restriction motifs. Surprisingly, significant mammal genome nullomers are often present, but rare, in other mammals, suggesting that they are suppressed but not completely forbidden. Significant human nullomers are rarely present in human viruses, indicating viral mimicry of the host. More than 1/4 of human proteins are one substitution away from containing a significant nullomer. We provide a webbased, interactive database of significant nullomers across genomes and proteomes.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "In this study, we introduce a robust probabilistic method named Nullomers Assessor (https://github.com/gkoulouras/nullomers-assessor) for the evaluation of globally missing sets of oligomers in any species, considering the fact that biological sequences of living organisms are driven by mutational biases and natural selection, and consequently are not entirely random (10). Naturally occurring sequences present patterns and combinatoric properties which can be signatures for the identification of functional elements as such promoters, tandem repeat expansions, introns, exons, and regulatory elements (18). In addition, evolutionarily well-separated species are known to possess distinct statistical characteristics in their DNA or peptide sequence chains (19). All these distinctive properties of biological sequences have frequently been studied using probabilistic models. Markov chain models have been widely and successfully employed in various biological problems including sequence analysis in the past (26-29). Taking advantage of these particular properties of biological sequences, we developed a method which approximates the likelihood of an absent sequence to occur exactly zero times, in order to address the following three questions. First, are there statistically significant minimal absent sequences in biological species; in simple words, what is the expected probability for an actual nullomer to be indeed absent, based on the compositional pattern in the full genome or proteome of a species? Second, are there significant MAWs in common across evolutionarily diverse living organisms? And finally, does the creation of a previously absent sequence perturb a molecule; more precisely, are there mutations with functional or stability impact which at the same time 'generate' a nullomer? Furthermore, given the possible relevance of nullomers to diverse research areas, as for example the under-studied 'dark' majority of the genome (11,12), patterns and evolutionary features between viruses and host species (31-34, 76), rare variants (13-15) as well as cancer driver mutations in non-coding regions (25), we provide the community with the results of the present study in the form of a publiclyavailable, downloadable and web-accessible repository of significant absent motifs, named Nullomers Database (https://www.nullomers.org/). Modern web-technologies and visualization features have been harmonically combined resulting in a dynamic and user-friendly environment. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt for a centralised, open-access and searchable resource of nonoccurring genomic and peptide sequences. Nullomers Database is intent on being a periodically updated and continuously enriched repository of significant absent sequences from various organisms, as they have been assessed by Nullomers Assessor. We are hopeful that the intuitive and interactional graphical user interface of Nullomers Database, in conjunction with the integrated annotation and the powerful searching features that it employs, will facilitate exploration and shed new light on the puzzling and, up to the present time, little-known world of nullomers.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "Materials and Methods", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The identification of nullomers was achieved using the MAW console application (5), an open source (n)-time and (n)-space algorithm for finding minimal absent words based on suffix arrays. It is fast and straightforward for genomes and proteomes of moderate length, because all calculations are performed in-memory. On the other hand, when applied to long sequences of size the algorithm requires more than 20 * bytes of available RAM, which causes a bottleneck on large datasets such as the human genome. For the detection of nullomers on sizable datasets we used the em-MAW software tool (6), a marginally slower alternative which utilises external memory. Both MAW and em-MAW require an input fasta file which contains the whole genome or proteome of an organism, as well as two numerical arguments that indicate the shortest and longest nullomers to search for. Throughout the study, we searched for sequences of length between 4 and 14 nucleotides which are globally absent from both forward and reverse-complement strands. For peptide sequences we set the identification range between minimum 4 and maximum 6 amino acids in order to keep complexity at a reasonable level.

Although many biotechnological applications have been envisioned, from potential selective drugs (1) (2) to forensic practice (3) , the actual role of nullomers has intensely been debated (4) and still remains enigmatic. Lately, fast tools and efficient algorithms have been introduced making the discovery of globally missing sequences practical (5-8, 42, 56-57) . In 2012, Alileche and colleagues demonstrated that two absent 5-amino-acid peptides cause fatal damage to cancer cells (2) , while 5 years later Alileche and Hampikian showed that the same MAWs have a broad lethal effect on cancer cell lines derived from nine organs represented in the NCI-60 panel (1) . Additionally, Silva and colleagues have reported that three minimal 12-nucleotide fragments entirely absent from the human genome, appear consistently at the same location in two protein-coding genes of Ebola virus genomes (9) . Although there exists an unambiguous sequence conservation in their findings, it is not clear whether the absence of these oligomers is statistically expected. In the same study, the term minimal relative absent words (RAWs) is introduced, describing sequences that are present in a pathogenic organism but absent from its host. On one hand, all the above findings ideally support the conjecture that MAWs may have gone extinct due to evolutionary pressure or putative deleterious effects. Perhaps the unfavourable properties of nullomers are linked with forbidden spatial conformations followed by functional consequences incompatible with life. Hence, the structural arrangements of globally absent motifs and the putative perturbation of molecules upon their appearance (i.e. emergence of a nullomer upon a mutation) form an interesting area for future research. Conversely, a finite set of sequences, for example the entire genome or proteome of a species, does not include all the different combinations of elements from the alphabet it is composed of, due to the fact that the combination of residues in a sequence increases exponentially with its length. Therefore, it still remains a riddle whether the absence of a nullomer is, in fact, an evolutionary consequence linked with adverse effects or a product of randomness. NCBI Genome (35; ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/). We developed custom Python scripts to discard headers and concatenate sequences from multiple fasta files, to produce files with one header and one-line sequence for each organism. The above step was applied to protein sequences as well, because MAW and em-MAW are developed in a way to calculate nullomers of each individual record in a fasta file. For the identification of peptide nullomers, we combined information both from the Swiss-Prot and TrEMBL sections of UniProtKB including protein isoforms. The redundant but slightly different sequences (isoforms) that were included in this step can contribute to the elimination of incorrectly identified MAWs. Moreover, the incorporation of predicted with manually reviewed records produces a list of more confident non-occurring sequences. The final pre-processing step included the removal of any ambiguous residues (character N in genomes or B, J, X, Z in proteins).

As an example, a stochastic matrix of third-order for all the naturally occurring amino acid residues in a bacterium (20 distinct amino acids assuming that neither selenocysteine nor pyrrolysine are present) requires a matrix of 20 * 20 3 = 160.000 cells (namely 20 rows and 20 3 columns, or vice versa).

We utilised the abovedescribed fundamental mathematical notion and developed a custom Python script (Nullomers Assessor) which approximates the likelihood for a nullomer to occur zero times based on the first four orders of Markovian chains (including zeroth order). More precisely, four distinct p-values are assigned to each nullomer of the list. To elucidate and put this probabilistic property into a more biological context, we provide the following example.

A wide species coverage is observed since the overall motifs are absent from more than 6.000 distinct species whereas, interestingly enough, the most frequent missing sequences are recognition sites of host restriction enzymes, according to the Restriction Enzyme Database (65; http://rebase.neb.com/). Restriction enzymes present in prokaryotes recognise specific sequential patterns in viruses and cleave their DNA sequences into fragments (66) (67) . These cutter enzymes provide a defence mechanism in host species against virus invasion and have been successfully utilized in a range of biotechnological applications and research studies (68) (69) (70) (71) (72) . Although it is known that restriction sites confer a selective disadvantage to viruses, this has not been previously linked to nullomers. The fact that our top hits include several palindrome sequences ranging from 4 to 6 bases in length offers potential for virus nullomers to be utilised as predictors of previously unknown restriction motifs in host organisms. Furthermore, given the robustness of our evaluation method, the entire dataset can offer a valuable resource for future in silico research.

Main emphasis has been given to peptide nullomers and, more specifically, to regions of proteins that are prone to give rise to a significant nullomer upon a single amino acid alteration. Assuming that the deficit of the shortest absent words is governed by evolutionary factors with unfavourable consequences, then one would expect that the emergence of a nullomer upon a mutation would possibly have a negative effect.

Given the dynamic nature of the UniProt database, the information retrieval of all the above-described steps has been automated, making Nullomers Database a fully autonomous, scalable, and frequently updated repository. Additionally, the integration of MolArt (24) , an interactive visualization plugin (Figure 9 ), allows for the simultaneous exploration of multiple sequential and structural features in protein nullomers. The interconnected and synchronized panels of MolArt permit users to identify co-occurrent elements in regions that are prone to engender a missing word upon a single amino acid substitution. The entire sequence annotation of the plugin is retrieved from UniProt in real-time whereas the corresponding experimental structures are dynamically fetched from Protein DataBank (or from Swiss Model Repository when a structure is not available).

built-in with the current version of the tool. In exact terms, users can choose between Bonferroni (47), Benjamini-Hochberg (48; widely known as False Discovery Rate or simply FDR), or Tarone method (49) which is a modified Bonferroni procedure. The Bonferroni correction is particularly conservative, especially when applied to proteome datasets, due to the large alphabet size and high number of tests. More specifically, each of the 4 individual p-values is multiplied by the count of all possible different -mers of length . For example, the corrected p-value of a genomic absent motif. For peptide nullomers the multiplier changes to 20 . Generally,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF1": {"text": ". Although none of the 13 genomic nullomers in Homo sapiens have emerged significant in Pan troglodytes, despite their genomes being ~98% identical, the latter shares 3 absent motifs with the closely related species Gorilla gorilla and Pan paniscus. Furthermore, Pan paniscus shares 2 nullomers with Saimiri boliviensis forming a cluster of related organisms with significant results in common. This led us to investigate whether significant absent sequences in human are present in chimp, and vice versa. Since the two genomes are very similar, it might be considered not surprising that absent words in human are rare in chimp. For this reason, we also investigated two more distant species, Mus musculus and Canis lupus familiaris. Then, for each significant nullomer of a species, we computed the observed as well as the expected number of occurrences in the other 3 organisms by exploiting again equations (2) and (3) in the Materials and Methods section. We found that the majority of nullomers in Homo sapiens is present in Pan troglodytes (and vice versa) with a median frequency of 1 occurrence, while the median number of expected occurrences of the significant human MAWs in chimp is 47 (", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF2": {"text": ". Thus, identical significant nullomers which are shared across species might be usable for biotechnological applications or further research. What is noticeable in this dataset is the high rate of mononucleotide tracts. It has previously been shown that enrichment of poly(A) tracts is linked with important functional roles, including DNA methylation (62), ribosome stalling (63), and translational efficiency (64), to name a few. The longest poly(A) sequence in our dataset is a 11-nucleotide poly(A) motif absent in 18 bacterial and archaeal species, while a 12-mer poly(T) tract has been marked significant in Clostridium sartagoforme, implying the high content of repeated adenine and thymine in their genomes, respectively. In Homo sapiens, the 'ATTTCGCGAAAT' nullomer constitutes one of the nearly 250 palindrome nullomers of the result set and it is shared with Dasypus novemcinctus and Gekko japonicus.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "Two possible nullomer-making mutations Ser > Pro and Lys > Asn in positions 628 and 1171 can give rise to the 'LVVPR' and 'INESS' absent words,respectively. Therefore, the actual amino acid chains 'LVVSR' and 'IKESS' that normally exist in the reference protein sequence could be considered 'sensitive' to putative S628P and K1171N mutations in the 4 th and 2 nd position, respectively. Moving this simple idea forward in conjunction with the scenario of noxiousness behind entirely missing sequences, we hypothesised that nullomer-making mutations would potentially introduce unfavourable effects to these molecules. To this direction, we developed an automated procedure that detects positions in proteins which are susceptible to generate one of the significant identified nullomers upon a single amino acid alteration. We applied this to the entire Homo sapiens and Mus musculus proteomes ending up with a list of 34.053 positions which are prone to create one of the 21 significant nullomers in both organisms(Table 3). In the human proteome, 21. 668 potential alterations can lead to one of the 13 significant minimal absent peptides in 16.045 UniProt IDs (of which 6.576 belong to unique manually reviewed records). This suggests that more than one fourth of the human proteome is susceptible to introducing an utterly absent sequence, with a single amino acid alteration. With this information in hand, we investigated evolutionary tendencies of mutability (amino acids to be mutated) and targetability (resulting amino acids upon a mutation) in nullomermaking positions(Figure 4, 5). A clear propensity is apparent in targeted valine in the human proteome, while the extremely high number of mutations to isoleucine in both organisms constitutes an intriguing observation considering that Ile is one of the rare amino acids (frequency <5%). At the opposite extreme, 5 amino acids (cysteine, histidine, methionine, tryptophan, tyrosine) are null targets of human nullomermaking mutations, a reasonable fact given that none of the 13 significant nullomers have any of these amino acids in their sequences. Similarly, asparagine, cysteine, histidine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, and tyrosine are not nullomer-making target amino acids in Mus musculus. We produced matrices of mutational transitions in order to further detect possible tendencies (Figure 5). The resulting plots demonstrate that Leu > Val and Leu > Ile are two prevalent alterations in human, whereas Ala > Ile and Glu > Ile are the most common nullomer-creating substitutions in the mouse proteome. Curiously, Leu, Ile, and Val are precisely the three branched-chain amino acids. Next, we investigated whether the inclusion of non-reviewed proteins (records from TrEMBL) affects the nullomers' mutational space.", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF4": {"text": "14 virus families (Figure 7B). Sequences of Retroviridae and Herpesviridae families share the highest number of RAWs with 6 and 5 motifs, respectively. Most interestingly, the relative absent peptide 'NGLGV' solely appears in 156 sequences of Human coronavirus HKU1 (HCoV-HKU1) and Human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) which both belong to the Betacoronaviruses genus, and tend to cause mild illness. After performing sequence alignment using Clustal Omega (58), we observed conservation of the 'NGLGV' motif in all 156 protein sequences of the family. More specifically, the 'NGLGV' pattern is localised in the S2 subunit of the coronavirus spike glycoprotein (59,60), a multifunctional protein which mediates virus invasion and fusion of the virion into host cells. We continued an in silico investigation on 435 full-sequenced spike glycoproteins of SARS-CoV-2 species from the current coronavirus pandemic (data retrieved on April 9, 2020 from NCBI Virus) and observed a similar (but not absent) motif 'NGIGV' within a similarly conserved sequence window of the same region. The replacement of human-absent 'NGLGV' by human-present 'NGIGV' suggests evolution towards host sequence mimicry and might contribute to immune evasion. Visual sequence weblogos (61) of 25-amino-acid windows around the specific RAWs (Figure 8A, 8B) demonstrate a clear amino acid consensus. Next, we extracted 71 records of full-sequenced spike glycoproteins of the same genus from various types of bat species (the latest collection date was March 2018). Although there is a varying pattern among these sequences, the most frequent motif in the examined region in bats is the 'NGIGV' again (Figure 8C) perhaps indicating evolutionary preadaptation. Moreover, only five sequences of spike glycoproteins from Betacoronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) were available, which present a conserved 'NGLTV' oligopeptide within a dissimilar sequence window (Figure 8D).
