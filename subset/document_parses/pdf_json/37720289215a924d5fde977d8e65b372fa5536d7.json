            "text": "The fate of tissue-resident memory CD4 T cells (Trm) has been incompletely investigated. Here we show that intranasal, but not parenteral, immunization with CTA1-3M2e-DD stimulated M2e-specific Th17 Trm cells, which conferred strong protection against influenza virus infection in the lung. These cells rapidly expanded upon infection and effectively restricted virus replication as determined by CD4 T cell depletion studies. Single-cell RNAseq transcriptomic and TCR VDJ-analysis of M2e-tetramer-sorted CD4 T cells on day 3 and 8 post infection revealed complete Th17-lineage dominance (no Th1 or Tregs) with extensive functional diversity and expression of gene markers signifying mature resident Trm cells (Cd69, Nfkbid, Brd2, FosB). Unexpectedly, the same TCR clonotype hosted cells with different Th17 subcluster functions (IL-17, IL-22), regulatory and cytotoxic cells, suggesting a tissue and context-dependent differentiation of reactivated Th17 Trm cells. A gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated up-regulation of regulatory genes (Lag3, Tigit, Ctla4, Pdcd1) in M2e-specific Trm cells on day 8, indicating a tissue damage preventing function. Thus, contrary to current thinking, lung M2e-specific Th17 Trm cells are sufficient for controlling infection and for protecting against tissue injury. These findings will have strong implications for vaccine development against respiratory virus infections and influenza virus infections, in particular.",

            "text": "Pre-existing influenza-specific CD4 T cells have been shown to correlate with reduced morbidity in humans and in murine models of influenza virus infection CD4 T cells can convey protection independently of specific antibodies. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] To achieve strong protection against influenza virus infection many studies have identified mucosal vaccination and in particular intranasal (i.n) immunization to be superior to systemic immunization for the generation of lung resident T cells. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Indeed, lung resident memory CD4 T cells have been found to be critical for protection by functioning as helper cells for lung B -and CD8 T cell responses, but also as effector cells exerting direct actions. 7, [12] [13] [14] [15] Whereas influenza-specific Th1 cells have been associated with resistance against infection in the past, several recent studies have documented a critical role also for Th17lineage cells in providing antibody-independent protection. 5, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] However, other studies have documented a detrimental role of Th17 cells for protection against infection, which is reminiscent of their proinflammatory functions observed in several autoimmune diseases. [21] [22] [23] Nevertheless, the exact mechanisms for protection still awaits to be determined, but, for example, lung infiltration of neutrophils was dependent on IL-17 and IL-17 also plays an essential role in regulating transport of secretory IgA (SIgA) across the mucosal membrane. 5, 24, 25 Furthermore, Th17 cells have been reported to attract influenza-specific cytotoxic CD8 T cells to the site of infection and they appear critical for the development of iBALT. 18, 22, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] Direct evidence that influenza-specific CD4 T cells can play a critical role for immune protection against infection was obtained by using an adoptive transfer model with HA-specific Th1 or Th17 memory CD4 + T cells. 6, 31 Interestingly, whereas the transferred CD4 + T cells supported CD8 + T cell and antibody responses, they also acted as cytotoxic CD4 T cells, in a perforin-dependent manner. 9, 31 Indeed, it was the tissue-resident memory CD4 T cells (Trm) that exhibited cytotoxicity against influenza virus-infected cells. [31] [32] [33] [34] These CD4 Trm cells were thought to be derived from Th1 cells that undergo maturation to T helper CTL (ThCTL) functions, while memory Th17 cells have not been associated with a cytotoxic function. 35, 36 However, the critical importance of Th1 cells for protection against influenza virus infection was recently challenged when it was found that Tbet-deficient mice exhibited unperturbed protection against infection in the complete absence of Th1 cells and a sizeable fraction (20%) of Tbx21-defective CD4 T cells produced IL-17 in the lung. 20 Interestingly, an IL10-deficient mouse model revealed that influenza viruses appear to have evolved mechanisms to inhibit Th17 responses, thus, potentially representing a mechanism of immune evasion. 18, [37] [38] [39] In addition, Th17 cells have been shown to play a key role in preventing opportunistic secondary bacterial lung infections, an often lethal complication that is frequently associated with influenza virus infections. 16, 30 Plasticity among CD4 T cell subsets has attracted much attention in recent years. [40] [41] [42] [43] For example, the ability of Th1 cells to transform into Th17 or Treg cells has been amply documented. Co-expression of Tbet or ROR\u03b3t by Foxp3-regulated cells; IL10 production by Th1, Th2, and Th17 cells; IFN\u03b3 production by Th17 cells; and IL13 production by Th1 cells, are other examples of functional plasticity. [44] [45] [46] However, the mechanisms that drive this plasticity in antigen-committed CD4 T cells are still largely unknown, although they appear to be heavily contextdependent and may be ascribed to tissue-specific factors. 47 In fact, little is known about the cues that promote Trm cell development following immunizations, let alone immunizations for long-term influenza-specific protection. 48 Swain and co-workers identified a critical checkpoint at days 5-7 post-infection when effector CD4 T cells developed into Trm cells, which required IL-2 and cognate antigen-presentation. 49, 50 A critical question to answer is what the nature is of the Trm cell if it develops from effector cells and how can the Trm cell provide a progeny with necessary effector functions to combat infection and protect against tissue injury? For example, are Trm cells derived from Th1 effector cells, required for protection against influenza virus infection, or can these be derived from Th17 cells, especially in the light of unperturbed resistance against infection in Tbx21-deficient mice? 20, [51] [52] [53] Indeed, Th17-skewed memory CD4 T cells have been reported to exhibit a mix of Th1, Th2, Th17, and Treg-functions, even including cytotoxic features, in response to viral infection and inflammation. 44, 45 Thus, despite a growing appreciation of lung Trm cells for immune protection against influenza virus infection the signaling and transcriptional pathways that regulate the function of these cells during infection remain elusive.",

We performed a temporal transcriptome and TCR VDJ-analysis of M2e-specific Trm cells isolated from the lung by FACS-sorting on day 3 and 8 post infection, in mice that had been immunized i.n 2 and 6 months earlier with CTA1-3M2e-DD.",

We used Balb/c mice that were challenged 3 weeks after i.n immunizations with a 4xLD 50 -dose of the X47 virus strain (H3N2). Only i.n immunizations with CTA1-3M2e-DD resulted in significant survival rates and reduced morbidity, while subcutaneous (s.c) or intraperitoneal (i.p) immunizations failed to protect the animals, albeit comparable serum anti-M2e IgG antibody titers were detected in all groups (Fig. 1a) . The better protection corresponded to a significant reduction in lung virus titres after i.n immunizations, which also was the only route to give M2etetramer specific CD4 T cells in the lungs (Fig. 1a, b) . Noteworthy, the infection itself failed to induce detectable M2e-specific CD4 T cells in unimmunized control mice (Fig. 1b) . Hence, the presence of M2e-specific lung CD4 T cells was a consequence of successful local i.n immunization, which was much superior to systemic immunizations (s.c, i.p or i.m), as we have also documented before. 11 While serum IgG anti-M2e antibody levels were shared by all immunized mice we investigated whether lack of local IgA antibodies could have accounted for the better protection found in i.n immunized mice. To this end we asked whether IgA -/deficient mice were equally or less well protected compared to WT mice. 58 We found that both strains were equally well protected following i.n immunizations and serum anti-M2e IgG titres were comparable in WT and IgA -/mice (Fig. 1c) . By contrast, when CD4 T cells were depleted from WT mice by administration of anti-CD4 mAb prior to the challenge infection we observed significant reduction in survival in immunized mice (Fig. 1c) . This correlated with a reduced ability to control virus propagation (Fig. 1c) . The M2e-peptide did not stimulate CD8 T cell responses and so depletion of CD8 T cells had no effect on protection or virus load in i.n immunized and challenged mice ( Supplementary Fig. S1a c). 5, 11, 56, 59 Taken together, lung CD4 T cells, but not mucosal IgA, was required for reducing virus replication, which was also associated with enhanced immune protection.",

Lung virus titres were essentially unchanged despite FTY720-treatment (Fig. 1d ). Of note, protection was critically dependent on the M2e-peptide as no protection was observed in mice immunized with the CTA1-DD adjuvant vector alone (Fig. 2d) . 5 The distribution of M2e-specific T cells among all CD4 T cells in the lung post-infection was two-fold higher in FTY720-treated (22%) as compared to untreated i.n immunized mice (11%) (Fig. 1e) . The great majority of M2e-specific CD4 T cells were CD44 + (90%) and CD69 + (80%) cells irrespective of FTY720treatment (Fig. 1f) . Thus, it appeared that M2e-specific lung Trm cells do not require support from lymph node or spleen M2especific effector memory CD4 T cells to convey strong protection. 10 Long-term protection correlates with the presence of Th17 Trm cells in the lung To assess M2e-specific resident CD4 T cell memory (Trm) cells mice were rested for 2 or 6 months following the last day of i.n immunizations. We then challenged these mice by a sublethal dose of X47 virus to decipher which functional memory CD4 T cell A. Omokanye et al. subsets that expanded in the lung and in the mediastinal lymph nodes (mLN) in response to infection. FTY720 was used to block recruitment of memory CD4 T cells from lymph nodes and the spleen to the lung as before. 53 The frequency of M2e + Trm cells was significantly higher in the lung compared to memory CD4 T cells in mLN (Fig. 2a) . Whereas FTY720-blockade did not affect the level of M2e + CD4 T cells in the lung, it strongly increased M2e + CD4 T cells in the mLN, as expected (Fig. 2a) . potential of local expansion of these cells following infection (Fig. 2a) . The vast majority of M2e + memory CD4 T cells in lung and mLN were Th17 cells (Ror\u03b3t + ) (65-80%) as determined by flow cytomtry. A reproducible fraction of the M2e + CD4 T cells expressed the NKG2A-marker, associated with a cytotoxic function (7% NKG2A + ) and more lung cells were CXCR6 + (>95%) than in mLN (70%), a marker previously found to correlate with Trmmediated anti-infectious protection in the lung (Fig. 2b) . 62 When tested in antigen-recall responses in vitro the M2e + memory CD4 T cells from lung and mLN exhibited a clear dominance of IL-17 spot forming cells (SFC), with low to undetectable levels of IFN\u03b3 SFCs found (Fig. 2c ) Clear evidence of specific cytotoxicity was also observed in lung M2e + Trm cells when incubated with M2elabeled target B cells in vitro (Fig. 2d) . Thus, following a challengeinfection in i.n CTA1-3M2e-DD immunized mice we found a dominant memory M2e-specific Th17 (Ror\u03b3t + ) response in the lung and mLN that was associated with IL-17 and cytotoxic functions.",

We observed a 100-fold increase in lung M2e + Trm cells over the 8-10 days of infection (Fig. 2f ). This dramatic increase correlated closely with a reduction in virus propagation, as assessed by fold-change of influenza virus segment-specific transcripts in the lungs of immunized as compared to unimmunized control mice (Fig. 2f ).

            "text": "To get a detailed understanding of the expansion and functional differentiation of the responding lung CD4 Trm cells following infection we performed single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNAseq) analysis of TCR\u03b2 + M2e-tetramer-binding FACS-sorted cells on days 3 and 8 post-infection, correlating with protection and decreased viral load (day 3 effector phase), and increased survival (day 8 recovery phase), respectively. At each time point we sorted the M2e + Trm cells to high purity (>95%) from 5 pooled mice that had been immunized 6 months earlier and analyzed their transcriptomes at the single-cell level using the 10X Chromium platform (Fig. 3a ). After quality control, a total of 2013 cells from day 3 and 3262 cells from day 8 were used for downstream analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2a-c) . First, we confirmed that all sequenced CD4 T cells expressed Cd3e, Cd3g, Thy1, and Cd4 genes, and that expression of the Cd8a and Cd8b genes was absent from our samples ( Supplementary Fig. S2a ). In total, 11 clusters were identified using Louvain algorithm (Fig. 3b , c, and Supplementary Fig. S2b ). Differentially expressed genes (DEG) across clusters allowed us to identify major T cell subsets and based on Cd44, Sell, and Ccr7 gene expression we could distinguish a single cluster with na\u00efve cells and 10 clusters hosting different memory CD4 T cell subsets ( Fig. 3b -e, Supplementary Fig. S3 , and Data S1). The most striking observation was that 4 clusters could be directly assigned to the Th17-lineage based on their higher expression of the Il17a, Rorc, Ror\u03b1, Tmem176a/b, and Ahr genes (Fig. 3b , c, e, Supplementary  Fig. S4i -n). 66 Of these an archetypical Th17 cluster (Th17) exhibited the highest expression of Serpinb1a, Znrf1, Il17re, and Ramp1, suggestive of a homeostatic expansion of these cells ( Supplementary Fig. S3b , d). 67 A second Th17 cluster (Th17/IL-22) expressed tissue repair genes Il22, Il17f, and Csf2 (GM-CSF) and was also high in IL-21 gene expression (Fig. 3b, e) . Further, a third cluster (Th17/Tnf) expressed high levels of activation/ inflammation genes such as Tnf, Nr4a1, and Nfkbid and hosting increased expression of Malt1, Maff, and Cxcr4 genes, similar to Th1 cells and possibly associated with a pro-inflammatory function (Fig. 3b , e, Supplementary Fig. S3a, d) . 68 Finally, we identified a Th17 cluster (Th17/Bcl2) that exhibited elevated expression of S-phase genes, Bcl2 and Lmna, and that was lower in expression of cytokine and activation genes, possibly potential memory cells (Fig. 3b, e) . Less prominent clusters hosted cells with gene Fig. 1 Intranasal immunizations with CTA1-3M2e-DD stimulate resident memory M2e-specific CD4 T cells and protection against infection in the lung. Female Balb/c mice, 6-8 weeks old, were immunized i.n., s.c., or i.p. with 5 \u00b5g of CTA1-3M2e-DD on days 0, 10, and 20 or given PBS alone i.n.at the indicated time points. After 3 weeks the mice were infected i.n with 4xLD 50 of the influenza X47 virus strain and monitored for survival and loss of body weight for 14 days. a Survival and body weight in groups of mice (n = 10), with lung virus titres measured in duplicate at 4 days post infection (n = 3).

Effective CD4 T cell depletion was achieved by i.p-injections of 400 \u00b5g anti-CD4 mAb (clone GK1.5) administered on 3 consecutive days prior to infection. Survival and body weight were monitored (n = 10), with lung virus titres measured in duplicate at 4 days post infection (n = 3).

Importantly, we found a single cluster hosting cytotoxic CD4 T cells (ThCTL) typified by Eomes, Gzma, and Ccl4 gene expression, and which also expressed several anti-viral encoding genes; Klrc1, Klrd1, Prf1, and Nkg7 (Fig. 3b , e, Supplementary Fig. S4f ). One cell cluster (Itgb1) expressed Itgb1, Ctsd, and Iftim3 genes and shared expression of many genes observed in other clusters, albeit at lower levels, but these cells also had higher proliferative S and G2M gene expression, in line with an intermediate state of differentiation (Fig. 3b, e, Supplementary Fig. S4h ). Finally, we identified a cluster that expressed the Ifih1, Cmpk2, and Daxx genes and which was also highly enriched for interferonstimulated genes (Isg) (Ifit3, Rsad2,Gbp4, and Isg15), identified as the Isg cluster (Fig. 3b, e, Supplementary Figs.

Both the Itgb1 and Isg clusters shared high expression of Tmem176a/b genes, linking these clusters to Th17-lineage cells, and suggesting that we, in fact, had identified a total of 6 Th17-lineage related clusters (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. S3d ). 69 Therefore, we concluded that at least 70-75% (day 3 plus 8 samples) of the M2e-binding CD4 T cells in the UMAP embedding appeared to be the progeny of activated lung Th17 Trm cells.",

However, noteworthy, the na\u00efve, Th1, and Treg clusters were predominantly found in day 3 samples and were probably contaminating cells (Fig. 3d ). Th17/Bcl2 (memory) and Th17/Tnf (pro-inflammatory) clusters, associated with early antiviral response, were observed in day 3 samples (Fig. 3d ). By contrast, the Th17-, Th17/ IL-22-as well as the Tr1-cluster were more strongly represented in day 8 samples, corresponding to the recovery phase of infection with more need for anti-inflammation and tissue repair (Fig. 3d) . Indeed, the computed top DEG, typifying each cluster on day 3 in the effector phase of infection, hosted several interferon-induced anti-viral genes (Irf1, Irf7, Ifrd1, Socs1, Socs3, Ifit1, Bst2, and Isg15) as well as genes associated with mature resident Trm cells (Cd69, Nfkbid, Brd2, FosB) (Fig. 3b ,e, Supplementary Fig. S5a and Data S2). From the early response of M2e-specific Trm cells to the recovery phase of infection on day 8 there was a shared increase in expression of adaptive antiviral response genes (Nkg7, Ccl5, Ctsd, Ctsw) and lymphocyte activation and maturation-associated genes (Icos, Jak3, Id2, Ramp1, Maf, Lgals1, Lgals3) as well as genes linked to cell motility (Cxcr6, Ccr2, Itgb2, Lsp1, Glrx) (Fig. 3e, Supplementary  Fig. S5b ). The expression of regulatory genes (Lag3, Tigit, Ctla4, Pdcd1, Csf1) was also more evident on day 8 than day 3 samples (Supplementary Fig. S5b ) Furthermore, IL-10 gene expression was observed in the Tr1-, Treg-and, less expected, in the CTLclusters (Fig. 3e) . Thus, the response to infection in lung M2especific Trm cells was strikingly enriched for Th17 cell functions and the transcriptome profiles indicated significant functional diversity, including cytotoxicity as well as immune regulation.",

The unique gene sequences of the TCR\u03b1 and \u03b2 chains were obtained from pooled mice on days 3 and 8 and projected onto the UMAP embedding (Figs. 3c, 4a) . 11 We observed that the na\u00efve-, Treg-, and Th1-clusters were mostly made up of unexpanded clones corresponding to less than 3 cells, likely indicating contaminants or non-responsive clones (Fig. 4a,b) . The diversity of TCR CDR3 motifs that could bind to the M2e-tetramer was clearly illustrated by the 15 most abundant combinations of TCR\u03b1 and \u03b2 chains that we observed (Fig. 4c) . In most cases the defined amino acid CDR3-region of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains was restricted to one nucleotide sequence (Supplementary Figs. S6, S7). The most highly expanded TCR clonotypes were detected in the Th17, ThCTL, Itgb1 and Isg clusters (Fig. 4a, b) . When the distribution of the top 20 most abundant TCR clonotypes with a unique CDR3-region were depicted in day 3 and 8 samples we found three on day 3, while a majority of significantly expanded clonotypes were observed in day 8 samples (Fig. 4d) . Most importantly, we observed that the unique clonotypes were represented in several of the clusters, suggesting great functional diversity of Trm cells at the clonal level (Fig. 4d, e, Supplementary  Fig. S7a, b) . Thus, from the TCR clonotype analysis (VDJ-analysis) we could conclude that individual expanded clones were distributed to different functional clusters with, for example, the same clone hosting cells belonging to the Th17 -and Isg-clusters as well as the Tr1-and/or the ThCTL clusters (Fig. 4d, e,  Supplementary Fig. S7a, b) . Indeed, the relative distribution of ThCTL and/or Tr1 cells among Th17 clonotypes varied greatly from no to nearly 100%, suggesting that lung Trm cells could give rise to a highly varied progeny of functional subsets, perhaps depending on local conditions upon activation ( Supplementary  Fig. S7b ).",

Indeed, in a majority of cases we observed M2especific TCR clonotypes that were present in all four Th17-clusters, as well as in the related Isg-, Itgb1-and Tr1 clusters, attesting to a high degree of functional diversity of lung M2e-specific Trm cells (Fig. 5c, d) . However, with certain other clonotypes we found predominantly archetypical Th17 or ThCTL cells (Fig. 5d , Supplementary Fig. S8 ). Thus, for example, the most frequent CAASMKDNYAQGLTF-CASWGGLGEQYF Trm clonotype was well represented in the four Th17-lineage clusters as well as in the Tr1, Itgb1, and Isg clusters, but no ThCTLs (Fig. 5e, Supplementary  Figs. S7b, S8) . On the other hand, the activated M2e-specific ThCTL CAVNNNRIFF_CASSENSGNTLYF clonotype also hosted progeny that expressed Th17-lineage genes (Fig. 4e, Supplementary Fig. 7a,  b ). An extended analysis of DEG between the CAASMKD-NYAQGLTF_CASWGGLGEQYF clonotype and other M2e-specific Trm cells in the respective clusters confirmed that these cells were primarily archetypical Th17 cells as few differences were recorded from the Th17 cluster (Fig. 5e) . By inference, more differences were found when analyzing DEG for this clonotype within the Th17:Bcl2,:Tnf or:IL-22 clusters. Interestingly, within each cluster the TCR clonotype demonstrated a shift towards a regulatory profile expressing Lag3, Csf1, and Tigit (Fig. 5e) . When comparing the eight most abundant TCR clonotypes across the four different Th17 clusters, we observed that the clonotype impacted greatly on the gene expression profile (Supplementary Fig. S8 ). Hence, a DEG analysis identified gene profiles that were different for different clonotypes within the same cluster. Finally, a Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of the co-differentially expressed genes between day 3 and 8, using gene ontology (GO) biological processes, confirmed an up-regulation of regulatory genes, including Cxcr6, Rbpj, Fnbp1, Lrr58, Eif3f, Ctla4, Lag3, Tigit, Pdcd1, Tgfbr1, IL-10, and Smad3 genes, in the day 8 recovery phase samples (Fig. 5f, Supplementary Fig. S4d,n, S5b) . Thus, the response to infection in the lung M2e-specific Trm cells showed a clear dominance of Th17-lineage related genes and the clonotypic analysis indicated major functional diversity, including cytotoxicity (ThCTL) and immune regulation (Tr1 cells) in activated and expanded lung Trm cells. Hence, it appears that Th17 Trm cells following i.n immunization with CTA1-3M2e-DD provide a broad range of effector and recovery phase functions, indicative of ",

In agreement with other studies, we found that lung Trm cells were perfectly able to expand locally in response to infection without the need to recruit peripheral M2e-specific effector or central memory CD4 T cells, as assessed in our FTY720-treatment experiments. 10, 53 In the Tbx21deficient mouse model anti-IL-17 mAb treatment failed to reduce the level of protection, hence, arguing for an important role of IFN\u03b3. 51 However, we did not find significant Tbx21 or Ifn\u03b3 gene expression in expanded M2e-specific Th17 Trm cells upon infection, (scRNAseq data). Neither did resting M2e-specific lung Trm cells after i.n immunization exhibit gene transcripts (Tbx21, IFN\u03b3) consistent with Th1 cells. In addition, in vitro recall responses to M2e-peptide were completely dominated by IL-17 production in isolated lung Trm cells. Therefore, we have little reason to think that Th1 cells were involved in protection following i.n immunizations with CTA1-3M2e-DD.",

These functional subsets likely contributed to protection and survival in the immunized mice because elimination of CD4 T cells prior to infection resulted in increased viral load and reduced survival. Given the many possible functions of Th17 Trms, documented by the scRNAseq data in the present study, we think complementing mechanisms of protection exist and that IL-17 is just one of several factors that are involved in anti-viral lung protection. 5 The fact that CD4 T cells can acquire ThCTL functions, restricted by MHC class II-expression has been known for long. 71 In the context of influenza virus infections CD4 T cells with ThCTL functions have been described in several studies. 32, 51, 72 These cells were thought to be derived from Th1 effector cells. However, because our scRNAseq cluster analysis failed to detect expanding cells in the Th1 cluster and cells with a ThCTL gene expression profile shared unique clonotypes with Th17-lineage cells we propose that these cells may have emanated from Th17 Trm cells. To our knowledge this is the first study to indicate that Th17 Trm cells can develop into ThCTL cells. Noteworthy, these cells had a higher expression of the Tbx21 gene compared to cells in the Th17-lineage clusters, but significantly lower than unexpanded Th1 cells. Virus-specific ThCTLs have been ascribed a protective role because virus-infected epithelial cells express MHC class II molecules and could, thus, be eliminated by ThCTLs, although direct evidence for this in vivo is still missing. 3, 34, 35, 73, 74 We demonstrated that CTA1-3M2e-DD immunized mice hosted CD4 T cells that were cytotoxic to B cells carrying M2e-peptide/MHC II complexes, providing in vitro evidence of a cytotoxic function in M2e-specific Trm cells. Thus, the ThCTLs could help in limiting viral propagation in the lungs as we observed between days 2-4 of infection.",

            "text": "The scRNAseq analysis of M2e-tetramer binding Trm cells revealed a transition from an inflammatory to an antiinflammatory function in the recovery phase (day 8) of infection, supported also by results from the GSEA. This way the effector stage of infection exhibited pro-inflammatory Th17 functions, while the recovery phase hosted regulatory Th17-cells that contributed to dampening inflammation (Th17) and promoting tissue repair (Th17/IL-22). 75 Consistent with previous reports that Th17 lineage cells can acquire Tr1 functions we found that the recovery phase hosted archetypical Th17, Th17:IL-22 as well as Tr1 cells with gene expression signatures typical for an antiinflammatory and immune regulating function. 23, 42 We think this functional breath of expanded lung Th17 Trm cells is important for preventing the extensive lung tissue damage that we have observed in unimmunized control mice following influenza virus infection. 56 Th17 cells have been described to differentiate into pro-inflammatory as well as anti-inflammatory effector cells depending on the context of activation. 23, 41, 76, 77 For example, there is considerable knowledge from studying Th17 subsets in the gut intestine that attest to a dynamic functional differentiation of cells from pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory functions. 40, 41, 78 Although earlier studies have shown that Th17 responses could exacerbate lung pathology upon influenza virus infection, 79 evidence from Tbx21-deficient mice, hosting lungs enriched for Th17 cells, exhibited reduced lung injury and less inflammation in response to infection. 23, 53 The fate of lung CD4 Trm cells upon activation has been inadequately investigated. 31, 53 Current thinking advocates that activated Trm cells largely recall the function of the effector CD4 T cells in the priming immunization. 53,72 Accordingly a successful influenza vaccine would be expected to generate a range of Trm cells of diverse functions. 3, 6, 31 However, the results of the present study somewhat contradicts this notion as we observed that the progeny of the same lung TCR clonotype appeared in effector cells displaying gene expression profiles typifying Th17-, Tr1-as well as ThCTL functions in response to infection. Because a unique TCR clonotype is unlikely to arise from multiple precursors we can assume that the diversity of function that we observed within each M2e-specific Trm clonotype in the lung is a consequence of differentiation upon reactivation rather than subset-specialization following priming. 80 This notion finds support in that Tr1 or ThCTLs frequencies among the expanded Trm clonotypes varied greatly between 0-100%, relative to the Th17 cell representation, which would be unlikely if the proportion of functional subsets were established already at the priming event ( Supplementary Fig. S7 ). Therefore, we propose that effector cells arising from activation of lung Th17 Trm cells show functional diversity as a reflection of the conditions at the site of activation in the lung. We believe that local cues and the tissue-specific microenvironment can influence differentiation and the type of function required by activated Th17 Trm cells to control infection or prevent tissue damage. 47 To ultimately answer the question whether differentiation diversity of responding lung Trm cells is the mechanism behind the multiple functional subsets observed within each clonotype or a function of predetermined subset distribution will require lineage-tracing experiments. 81 However, to the best of our knowledge such experiments cannot be done at present as labeling of lung Trm cells prior to the challenge infection is not technically possible.",

Both single cell RNA-seq and VDJ-seq Reads were pre-processed with 10X Cell Ranger software v.2 and further analyzed in R using mainly Seurat package {10.1038/nbt.4096}. Briefly, UMI counts were summed to the gene level for analysis. Genes detected in less than 3 cells were considered poorly expressed and removed from the analysis. The analysis was mainly focused on protein-coding genes. Cells with total UMI and gene counts above 3 standard deviations from the mean or with less than 200 genes were considered outliers and filtered out before further analysis. Effects from sequencing depth, gene counts, cell cycle, mitochondrial and ribosomal genes were regressed out. Since there were significant technical differences between the two samples, the datasets were integrated using the CCA method as implemented in Seurat. 83 Integrated data was then processed for principal component analysis (PCA, 100 components), where uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) 84 and the shared nearest neighbor (SNN, k = 10) graph were computed. Louvain clustering was performed on the SNN graph at varying resolutions. Differential gene expression was done using Wilcoxon test for each group, where genes with absolute log2 fold change above 0.1 and p-values below 0.05 were considered significant. Differentially expressed genes were further used for gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 85 with the fgsea package {10.1101/060012} using gene ontology (GO) annotations. The comprehensive annotation of cytokines, transcription factors, receptors, and other genes related to the immune response were defined elsewhere {10.1126/sciimmunol.aal2192 }. Pre-filtered abundance tables from Cell Ranger were used for VDJ analysis. Since most cells have different amounts of predicted VDJ sequences, only the most abundant TCR\u03b1 and TCR\u03b2 sequences found within each cell were assigned. For reproducibility purposes, all the analysis steps were done in controlled Conda environments 86 via the Sauron pipeline (unpublished, https://github. com/NBISweden/sauron). All analysis steps performed in this manuscript from counts to the main figures can be recreated by following the instructions in the Supplementary Data.

Mice were rested 3 weeks or 2 or 6 months after the final i.n immunization on day 20 and sacrificed 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, or 14 days after an influenza A virus challenge infection, as indicated. Serum and lungs were extracted and collected. Serum preparations were stored at \u221220\u00b0C until further analysis. For CD4 or CD8 T cell-depletion experiments mice were given 400 \u00b5g anti-CD4 mAb (clone GK1.5, BioXCell BE0003-1) or anti-CD8\u03b1 (clone 2.43 BioXcell) i.p. in 200 \u03bcL sterile PBS on 3 consecutive days. Depletion of lung CD4 or CD8 T cells was verified using FACS with a fluorochromeconjugated, non-competing CD4 mAb (clone RMA-4) or CD8\u03b1 mAb. To block lymphocyte egress from secondary lymphnodes and spleen mice were given 100 \u00b5g FTY720 (Cayman 10006292-50) i.p. in 200 \u03bcL sterile PBS every 48 h during the experiment. For testing of Trm status of the M2etetramer binding CD4 T cells in the lung, we used the protocol by Anderson et al using i.v injections at 5 min prior to sacrifice of 5 \u03bcg of fluorochrome-labeled anti-CD45.1 AF700 mAb (clone A20, BioLegend, #110724).61",
