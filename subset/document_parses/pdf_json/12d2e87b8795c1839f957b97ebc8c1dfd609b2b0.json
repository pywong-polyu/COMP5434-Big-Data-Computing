Plasma fractionators were the first to introduce NAT testing besides pathogen reduction procedures, to reduce the virus transmission risk through their products. To achieve a similar safety standard, NAT was then also introduced for labile blood components. German transfusion centres were the first to start in-house NAT testing of their donations in pools of up to 96 samples for HCV, hepatitis B virus (HBV), and human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1). Years later the diagnostics industry provided commercial HCV and HIV-1 and later HBV NAT tests on automated platforms. NAT tests for HIV-2, hepatitis A virus, and Parvovirus B19 followed, again driven by transfusion centres with their in-house tests. When severe acute respiratory syndrome corona virus (SARS-CoV) and West Nile Virus emerged it was the NAT that enabled the manufacturers and transfusion centres to instantly introduce sensitive and specific screening tests. Subsequent automation including sample preparation has significantly reduced the costs and complexity of the procedure and made it affordable to middle income countries as well.

Automation rendered possible the reduction of pool size in conjunction with increased throughput and sensitivity. Thus, antibody and antigen testing may be dispensable in the long run, particularly in the combination of NAT testing with pathogen reduction. There are new technologies on the horizon like digital droplet PCR, next-generation sequencing, lab-on-achip, and digital antigen assays, which are comparably sensitive. However, each of these has limitations, either in throughput, costs, automation, time to result, specificity, or the need for NAT as an integral part of the technology. Thus, NAT is still the shortest and most efficient means to the result. Donor screening NAT also contributed significantly to our knowledge on how fast viruses replicate, and on the respective diagnostic window.

With the invention of the real-time PCR, this technology became amenable to automation and it significantly reduced its inherent drawbacks [2] . Contamination of equipment and laboratories with amplification products (amplicons) could be minimized or even eliminated. Internal controls could easily be included and discriminated from the target sequences by labelling with different fluorophores. By multiplexing of PCRs several different viruses could be detected in parallel with one test and discriminated from each other by different labels.

Blood centres selling plasma for fractionation were therefore interested in establishing their own inhouse NAT pretesting of mini pools which could also be adopted for labile components. In contrast to fractionation plasma, platelets have a shelf life of days and results should be available before pooled platelets are manufactured. Thus, the time to result had to be condensed to less than 1 working day. Consequently, the pool size had to be reduced and pool resolution accelerated.
