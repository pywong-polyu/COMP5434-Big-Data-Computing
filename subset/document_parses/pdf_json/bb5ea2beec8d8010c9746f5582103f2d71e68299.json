Besides, we all learned very well that the disposable biochips, to be used in these in vitro diagnostic (IVD) testing systems, supposed to be produced in large amounts in a very short time to be widely available for the use of humanity to save more and more lives. That is why; roll-to-roll (R2R) polymer structuring manners offer such large quantities for the production of in vitro biochips. Our technology, based on R2R UV nanoimprint lithography (UV-NIL), has superior features. Via our pilot line, robust 7500 biochip components per 100 meter of a flexible, polymer foil coated with a UV curable photo-resin (i.e., parts with capillary fluidic channels or optical structures for IVDs) can be generated. This study shows an example of a prototype of a R2R UV-NIL generated chip: a foil, capillary flow-based IVD biochip for multiplexed DNA detection purposes (i.e., a Lab-on-a-Foil device). The biochip performance was further increased dramatically by integrating UV-NIL produced retro-reflective microstructures, which reflects the light back, to its design to enhance optical signal detection in a commercial IVD device, detecting DNA on a chemiluminescent-reaction basis.",

The process, which is performed at room temperature and ambient pressure, is based on UV-NIL structuring of a positive photo-resin, which is afore coated onto a polymer foil in the beginning of the process line. Our R2R UV-NIL pilot line was shown in Fig. 1 . The flexible, transparent polymer foils can be rapidly structured via our imprinting technology in multifarious designs (e.g., capillary-based fluidic channels or pumps, optical structures for IVD chips) with various length scales. Using the foils with typical thickness of ~100 \u00b5m, obtaining robust structures with an aspect ratio up to 5:1 (depth: width) [2] is possible. Therefore, our technology offers remarkable advantages, such as low cost, easy handling and high-throughput manufacturing for polymer-based and disposable in vitro diagnostic biochip production. In order to prove the performance of foil-based IVD chips, a model pathogen testing system with chemiluminescence-based target DNA detection was utilized in this study. A prototype foil DNA chip [1] was batch produced and integration of UV-NIL pyramidal retro-reflective (so-called RR) microstructures was done to investigate the performance of out-coupled light-enhancements in the presence of RR structures.

The master structures (i.e., fluidic channels or RR microstructures) were written on a silicon wafer (Si-Mat, Germany) via photolithography. Then the structures were transferred onto a polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold via soft-lithography, allowing 2.5-D topologies in a singlestep production. To produce the PDMS mold, PDMS\u00ae Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer kit (a PDMS monomer and a curing agent, Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) was utilized. For this purpose, the polymer mould was custommade by mixing the PDMS monomer curing agent with a ratio of 10:1 w/w, respectively. The mixture was casted over the master and cured on a hotplate for 24 h at 40 \u00b0C, sequentially. The PDMS mould was then detached from the wafer and cut into a final size for UV-NIL structuring purposes. The fluidic structures were transferred to a custom-developed photo-resin (NILcure JR21, Joanneum Research, Austria) coated on a polystyrene (PS) foil with thickness of 190 \u00b5m (4titude, Germany) by stamping. The curing of the photoresin with the imprinted structures was done using a UV-lamp (365 nm, Waldmann, Germany).",

The bottom chip part was a PS foil with probe DNA stripes printed using a capillary printer (BioDot\u2122 Inc., USA). The DNA printing buffer contained Brilliant Blue G (Sigma-Aldrich, Germany) solution and GENSPEED printing buffer with probe ss-DNA concentration of 2 \u00b5M for each. The chip lamination was performed by combining the two parts using an office laminator. The UV-NIL structured RR microstructures were integrated at the upper part of the foil chip after bonding. A retro-reflective band (Reflexite\u00ae Visibly Better\u2122) was used as master for the RR structures and was transferred to a PDMS mold. This mold was transferred to the top side of the chips by UV imprinting using the custom-developed photoresin NILcure JR21. Another custom-developed photoresin (mr-NIL500SF, micro resist technology, Germany) was utilized as an adhesion promoter. The structures were placed such that they serve as back-reflectors of the incident light generated via a chemiluminescent reaction in the chip. Therefore, a larger portion of the chemiluminescent light was guided towards the photodiodes increasing the signal collection efficiency.",

The chip performance testing was performed using a commercial IVD device: GENSPEED \u00ae R1, which provides rapid testing of hospital-acquired, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The measurements were conducted at room temperature using GENSPEED \u00ae MRSA hybridization solution which gives positive signals for mecA, SA, PC and HC genes and negative signals for SE, NC and mecC genes. The concentration of all target ss-DNAs was 1 pmol/\u00b5l for each (except for HC targets) in the GENSPEED \u00ae hybridization solution. All full complementary DNA strands are 25 base-pair long expect for HC, which is 105 base-pair long. The detection is based on DNA hybridization between surface bound ss-DNAs and biotinylated target ss-DNAs in the hybridization solution. The biotin is recognized by a streptavidin-horse radish peroxidase conjugate (SA-HRP) (i.e., commercial GENSPEED \u00ae Fig. 1 The photograph of our roll-to-roll (R2R) UV Nanoimprint Lithography (NIL) pilot line enzyme solution). The excess of unbound molecules were removed at the washing step. The solutions were and the testing procedure was described in detail, in our previous study [1] .

            "text": "This study shows for the first time retro-reflective microstructure integration into our R2R UV-NIL prototype, foil-based fluidic chip for multiplexed DNA detection purposes [1] . The experimental results revealed that the RR micro-structures on top of the fluidic biochips, significantly enhanced the optical signal collection efficiency and thus the signal at the detectors. Thereby, our results showed the applicability of our foil-based DNA chips, which give distinguishable signals for multiplexed detections, clearly using the commercial GENSPEED \u00ae R1 IVD product. Fig. 4 The results of the UV-NIL structured foil R2R UV-NIL prototypes, obtained using GENSPEED \u00ae R1 reader. Two types of DNA foil chips were generated (i.e., the chips with and without RR microstructures). For each chip type, nine replicates were measured at room temperature. The hybridization solution contained 1 pmol/\u00b5l of mecA targets for the MRSA detection. The response from each DNA stripe of the foil chip (SE, NC, mecA, mecC, SA, PC and HC) was shown with a differently colored column. The data were shown as a mean value \u00b1 standard deviation for each. SE, NC and mecC were the negative control signals",
