Specific attention is paid to the disparity between modern and post-modern approaches to mystery and how medical instruction and care has often been conducted in the vein of the former. However, with post-moderns now being trained as medical clinicians and serving on the frontlines of this pandemic, there is an opportunity to return to a more ancient manner of understanding humanity, one which places mystery on equal footing with chemistry.",

Moreover, \"by the beginning of the twentieth century, the notion of progress was closely linked with technological development, and that linkage intensified in the following decades\" (National Academy of Sciences 1993). Princeton philosopher Diogenes Allen put a finer point on it when he observed that \"modern science and technology so improved life that they led to a belief in progress, and in time to a belief in inevitable progress\" (1993) . Did this, however, really take place? Are we at the point of improved life and inevitable progress?",

These ways of knowing, being and doing are inherently ancient or, as Burrell notes, \"anti-antimedieval\" (2004) , insofar as post-modernism shares the medieval opinion regarding the insufficiency of reason and rationality (see Trakakis 2006) . One would expect, therefore, that the previous era's approach with a seemingly singular focus on rationality in the scientific and medical process would shift as well, but it seems as though it never did.

And for all the misconceptions about this generation of women and men [that, among other things, they are lazy and cannot leave their parents' basement (Beaton 2016) ] they are also known by one dominant truth: they are given to that which is ancient, to that which came well before them and their immediate predecessors. This reality is clearly envisaged in the general post-modern disdain for metanarratives, as first explained by the French philosopher, Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard in his seminal work: The Post-modern Condition. In it, he defined post-modernism as specifically \"incredulity toward metanarratives,\" which are grand stories that attempt to prove or legitimate themselves \"by an appeal to universal reason\" (Lyotard 1984; Smith 2006) . Rather, post-modernism is drawn to narrative and myth, ways of telling stories that do not need legitimacy to have an impact or even to be true. All of life, in fact, becomes a story that is being told in real time. However, because it cannot be proven or legitimated, this story is inherently mysterious. As is the case with all mysteries of life, the more we live this story, the more mysterious it becomes. Thus, the natural pull of the post-modern's life is toward mystery and a way of living, being and doing that looks more like the first century than it does the twentieth century (Evans 2015).",

Thus, from my own area of expertise, because chaplains are only permitted on COVID floors in rare and extreme circumstances, we have become truly essential only when the various rites associated with healing and death are requested or required, relegating spiritual care to a very modern kind of functionality. The goal is not to enter into the story and the suffering of those for whom we care, but to check the boxes, as it were, assuring ourselves that we did all that was necessary, but not all we possibly could.
