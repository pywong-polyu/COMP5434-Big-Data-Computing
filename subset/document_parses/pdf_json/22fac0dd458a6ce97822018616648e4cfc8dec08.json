Because chest radiology data may contain critical information about a patient's risk of deterioration in COVID-19 [11, 12] , they are often used by clinicians. Augmenting existing deterioration indices with additional features extracted from chest radiographs might therefore have a significant impact on their ability to differentiate low and high risk patients. Large influxes of hospitalized patients during the COVID-19 pandemic caused significant and acute strains on hospital resources around the globe [13] . While in-hospital deterioration models have been largely designed to identify patients at high risk for acute in-hospital complications [2, 3] , one potential novel application of these indices is identifying subsets of patients at low-risk of severe outcomes for safe, early discharge to alleviate hospital strain. For example, a recent validation study of the EPIC deterioration index found that it had promising predictive performance for identifying subsets of high-and low-risk patients with COVID-19 [4, 5] .",

We used COVID-19 PCR positive patients for validation and testing during the same time period. Patients were included if they required supplemental oxygen during their hospitalization and had at least one chest radiograph performed during the first 48 hours. Patients that experienced clinical deterioration or discharge within four hours of presentation were excluded. Clinical deterioration was defined as death or the need for ICU-level therapies including invasive or non-invasive mechanical ventilation, heated high flow nasal cannula, or vasopressor support. Patients that experienced clinical deterioration prior to their first radiograph being taken were also excluded. The analysis focused on two related clinical problems: (1) identifying low-risk patients unlikely to deteriorate who may be safe for early discharge; (2) identifying high-risk patients likely to deteriorate and need intensive care level therapies. We determined whether patients experienced a clinical deterioration event during their hospitalization using data recorded in the patient's electronic health records. If a patient experienced two or more deterioration events during the hospitalization, we define the deterioration time to be the time of the first event.",

At a negative predictive value of 90%, the image-augmented EDI index identified 6.1% of patients as low risk while the non-augmented version identified 0.7% of patients as low risk. At a negative predictive value of 90%, the image-only model identifies fewer than 0.5% of patients as low-risk.

For this analysis, we analyzed the Epic DI model at a negative predictive value of 90% and the MCURES models at a negative predictive value at 95%.

To date, few have described how to combine these indices with new data types such as chest radiographs. Physician-based prognosis includes the synthesis of information from multiple data sources such as structured EHR data, radiological imaging or clinical observations [9, 10] . Combining these sources of information from scratch is difficult because of the differing structure and varying sampling frequency of different data sources. In this work, we described a simply approach for synthesizing information, allowing developers to augment existing work in risk prediction and disease prognosis by combining additional data-sources (e.g. chest radiographs) without having to retrain existing models.",

Because the cohorts were similar, we were able to train a model on patients who tested negative for COVID-19 but performed well on COVID-19 patients, despite our limited access to COVID-19 data.

We speculate that this is because chest radiographs may not be as helpful in constructing features for identifying high-risk patients as for identifying lowrisk patients. The augmented deterioration indices improve upon the existing EHR-based indices and image model for identifying both low-risk patients for COVID-19 deterioration. This suggests that there does exist complementary information between the two modalities for identifying low-risk patients. Future work to further understand the relative value of various data modalities considered for inclusion in multimodal models is warranted. While our models perform well on our COVID-19 test cohort, there are several limitations to our analysis. While using non-COVID-19 patients provided access to more patients for model training, we might not have identified COVID-19-specific features during the training process [24] . As increasing amounts of COVID-19 data become more available, new models could be trained using such data. Moreover, as more data becomes available, we may be able to learn to combine features of individual modalities that might give insight into how different data sources complement one another which is an exciting direction for future work. Finally, we only validated this approach on data from a single institution. Future work should include testing this approach on data across institutions.",

These models include predictors from structured data, e.g. age, sex, nodule size, nodule location, and family history [25] . While these models achieve good discrimination and calibration, incorporating images of the nodules themselves as a predictor might improve these models further [11] .
