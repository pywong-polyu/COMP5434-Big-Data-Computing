However, preparation of training data is often a bottleneck in the lifecycle of deploying a deep learning model for production or research. Reusing models for inferencing a dataset can greatly save the human costs required for training data creation. Although there exist a number of model sharing platforms such as TensorFlow Hub, PyTorch Hub, DLHub, most of these systems require model uploaders to manually specify the details of each model and model downloaders to screen keyword search results for selecting a model. They are in lack of an automatic model searching tool. This paper proposes an end-to-end process of searching related models for serving based on the similarity of the target dataset and the training datasets of the available models. While there exist many similarity measurements, we study how to efficiently apply these metrics without pair-wise comparisons and evaluate the effectiveness of these metrics. We find that our proposed adaptivity measurement which is based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, is an effective measurement, and its computation can be significantly accelerated by using the technique of locality sensitive hashing.",

The prediction of the serving accuracy of a model in a target dataset is inherently a complex problem. It is related not only to the model architecture, but also to the similarity and relationships between the source and target datasets. The model is the best only if it fits your dataset [13] . However, we observe that existing model serving platforms are lack of the capability to automatically search for a model that is trained on the best fitting dataset. People need to perform a textbased search using keywords, scrutinize each search result, and manually check the similarity of each training dataset to their own dataset. Such human-centered model selection is inefficient, which delays the model deployment and incurs significant human costs. To alleviate this problem, it is critical to automate the model selection process for model serving. The technical challenges include: (1) Storing training datasets with the models incurs significant storage overheads and privacy concerns.",

Until very recently, the LSH for measuring similarity of probability distributions is studied [10, 23] . S2JSD-LSH [23] is first proposed to provide LSH functions for a new measurement S2JSD approx new , which is obtained by only keeping the linear terms in the Taylor expansion of the logarithm in the expression of S2JSD, the square root of two times the Jensen-Shannon (JS) divergence. However, their LSH design doesn't provide any bound on the actual JS-divergence. Then Chen et al.

For example, a dataset A may contain only a subset of labels of another dataset B; then supposing we have a model M A that is trained on A, and a model M B that is trained on B, the accuracy of M A on B, and the accuracy of M B on A could be very different. Obviously, simply applying the symmetric JS-divergence to the model selection problem may be problematic. While there exist asymmetric measurements of two probability distributions, such as Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, there doesn't exist efficient LSH families for these metrics. To address the problem, we propose to split a dataset into a number of partitions and compute the JS-LSH for each partition, so that each dataset is associated with multiple LSH signatures. Thus we propose a new metric, called adaptivity, based on the number of equivalent LSH signatures shared by two datasets and the size of the target dataset, which indicates the portion of samples in the target dataset that have been seen by the model.",

It is straightforward to use MinHash [35] , another LSH technique based on Jaccard similarity, to find all of the shared features between two datasets. However, because the overlapping space can only be determined at the query time, there is no way to pre-compute the JS-LSH signatures. To address the problem, we propose to use a compressed and indexed probability distribution to represent each model's training dataset by encoding occurrences of feature values falling into each hash bin, so that the storage overhead and runtime JS-LSH computation time can be significantly reduced without losing the effectiveness.",

            "text": "We evaluate our proposed methodology using four workloads. 1. Activity Recognition. Human activity recognition (HAR), is to predict the activities (e.g. walking, sitting, running, lying) based on data collected from multiple sensors attached to human body. HAR is a hot research topic in the pervasive computing area, and has been widely applied to indoor localization, sleep state detection, smart home sensing, and virtual reality [4] . In this work, we use three public activity recognition datasets, including OPPORTUNITY [9] , PAMAP2 [26] , and UCI DSADS [5] . Each dataset is extracted with 81 features [28] . The OPPORTUNITY dataset is collected from four human subjects executing various activities with sensors attached to more than five body parts. The PAMAP2 dataset is collected from nine subjects performing 18 activities with sensors attached to three body parts. The UCI DSADS dataset is collected from eight subjects wearing sensors on five body parts. We create 162 tables by sampling these datasets, so that each table represents samples collected from a body part for specific subject. Then we apply our approach to a series of scenarios where models are trained on each of these tables, and given a target dataset collected from a subject on a specific body part, we want to select a model to achieve the best accuracy on the target dataset. 2. Entity Matching (EM). Entity matching is to tell whether two tuples are referring to the same entity [7, 14, 15, 20, 33] . We mainly apply DeepMatcher [24] , which is an EM tool based on deep learning, to four datasets 1 : Walmart-Amazon, Abt-Buy, DBLP-Scholar, DBLP-ACM; and 11 smaller datasets from the Magellan Data Repository [11] 2 . Each task contains training and testing samples collected from two different datasets. For example, IMDB-TMD is to match movie tuples collected from IMDB and TMD respectively. Each EM task may have different features, and some tasks share a significant portion of common features. We focus on the model selection scenarios where a dataset is used for query, and a set of models are trained for the EM tasks on the rest of the datasets as candidates, and then we try to select a candidate model to serve the query dataset. 3. Image Recognition. To create five image datasets with distinct probability distributions, we randomly sample images from the Cifar-10 dataset without replacement. Cifar-10 is a collection of images with labels of ten classes, each containing 5, 000 images. Then we make four of the subsets skewed by adding 5000 images of the fourth class to the second and the fourth subset; 5000 images of the second class to the third subset; 5000 images of the eighth class to the third subset. These five datasets are called as Balanced, Skewed-1, Skewed-2, Skewed-3, Skewed-4 correspondingly. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed metrics for the image recognition scenario, we train ResNet56v1 model on each of the subsets respectively, and then perform five experiments of searching for the best model to be reused on each of the five datasets. 4. Natural Language Processing (NLP). We are mainly interested in two types of NLP tasks. The first task is to identify whether sentence pairs have equivalent semantic meanings. For this task, we train models on three different datasets: Microsoft Research Paraphrase Corpus (MRPC) that includes 3, 549 samples; Quora Question Pairs (QQP) that consists of 363, 192 samples; and Paraphrase Adversaries from Word Scrambling (PAWS) which has 49, 401 samples. The second task is about natural language inference (NLI), which is to identify the textual entailment relationship [22] between sentence pairs. Similar to the first task, we train models on three different datasets: Recognizing Textual Entailment (RTE) that has 2, 490 samples; Question NLI, which contains 510, 711 samples; and the SCITAIL dataset including 5, 302 samples, which is an entailment dataset created from multiple-choice science exams and web sentences. We train models for these tasks using the same pre-trained BERT base model 3 , denoted as uncased L-12 H-768 A-12, which contains 12 layers and 110 millions of parameters. Then for each task, we use one of the three datasets as the target dataset, and try to choose the best model to serve on the target dataset.",

In this experiment, for each test, we assume the source datasets that have the JS-divergence with the query dataset smaller than 0.1 compose the ground truth. We observe that using LSH can significantly accelerate the overall latency required for JSdivergence comparison, and achieve 5\u00d7 speedup on average, while the precision of our proposed approach is 100% and recall is above 93%, which are both acceptable results. We further evaluate how hyperparameters, such as r (as in Eq. 2.4), the number of concatenated hash functions (i.e., K l2hash ) of each band, the number of bands (i.e., L l2hash ), and the number of hash bins, will affect the accuracy of the JS-divergence computed using LSH compared to the baseline, which are illustrated in Fig. 4 . The comparison of Pearson correlation coefficient values of various metrics, including the adaptivity, the JSdivergence, the L2-distance, and the source accuracy, to the target accuracy are illustrated in Tab. 2. It shows that our proposed adaptivity metric can achieve better performance. Also among the four metrics, the source accuracy exhibits the least relevance with the target accuracy, which demonstrates our assumption that \"It's the best only when it fits you most\", and indicates that the similarity between the source and the target plays a more important role in determining model adaptivity.",

For most of above experiments, we choose the partition size of each dataset between 300 to 800. For the NLP experiment, when the source dataset and the target dataset has a significant size discrepancy, we choose the size of the smaller dataset to be the partition size, so that the smaller dataset has only one partition. Then we compare the latency of computing JS-divergence and adaptivity by using different partition sizes and for different sizes of source and target datasets. The results are illustrated in Fig. 5 , which illustrates that when partition size is around 500, the computational overhead for adaptivity is 1.7 \u2212 3\u00d7 of JS-divergence. In recent, numerous works are proposed to address open data discovery problems, including automatically discover table unionability [25] and joinability [34, 35] , and related tables [32] . Most of these works are trying to identify all similar features using LSH techniques based on Jaccard similarity or variants. While these works are helpful to this study in identifying the overlapping feature space, they are not di-rectly applicable in selecting related models, because the existence of a significant portion of shared features between the source and target datasets doesn't mean the probability distribution of the feature space of the two datasets are similar. Zamir and et al [31] propose a computational approach to find the transferable relationships, abstracted as taskonomy among the different computation vision tasks, e.g. depth estimation, edge detection, point matching and etc., so that some tasks can be trained using other tasks' output and thus require less training data and supervision budget. Their work is focused on the adaptivity from a task's output domain to another task's input domain. In contrast, our work is focused on the adaptivity of tasks' input domains. Also while their work is limited to computer vision, our work is targeting at a more generalized scenario. Kornblith and et al [17] study the relationship between the ImageNet model architectures such as ResNet, MobileNet, Inception-ResNet, etc., and the transfer learning performance. They observe that transfer learning based on finetune techniques (i.e., just tune the last two layers) even using a \"better\" model architecture may not achieve \"better\" accuracy. This means in regard of the effectiveness of transfer learning, the divergence of features between the source and target domains is more important than the difference of model architectures. Their observation indicates that our work may be applicable to find related models for transfer learning.",

We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed system through extensive experiments on a number of workloads including activity recognition, entity matching, image recognition, and natural language processing. Our proposed work can greatly save the human costs and shorten the deep learning model deployment time for production and research.",
