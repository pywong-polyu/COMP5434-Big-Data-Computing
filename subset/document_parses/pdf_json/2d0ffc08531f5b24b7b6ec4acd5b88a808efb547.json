Consequently, the mechanisms leading to this resistance must be understood and addressed. In this paper, we demonstrate that inhibition of deubiquitinylase USP7 significantly reduces cell proliferation in vitro and in vivo, blocks DNA replication progression and increases cell death in AML. Transcriptomic dataset analyses reveal that a USP7 gene signature is highly enriched in cells from AML patients at relapse, as well as in residual blasts from patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models treated with clinically relevant doses of cytarabine, which indicates a relationship between USP7 expression and resistance to therapy. Accordingly, singlecell analysis of AML patient samples at relapse versus at diagnosis showed that a gene signature of the pre-existing subpopulation responsible for relapse is enriched in transcriptomes of patients with a high USP7 level. Furthermore, we found that USP7 interacts and modulates CHK1 protein levels and functions in AML. Finally, we demonstrated that USP7 inhibition acts in synergy with cytarabine to kill AML cell lines and primary cells of patients with high USP7 levels. Altogether, these data demonstrate that USP7 is both a marker of resistance to chemotherapy and a potential therapeutic target in overcoming resistance to treatment.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) originates from the transformation and clonal expansion of undifferentiated hematopoietic progenitors, characterized by altered growth, differentiation, and proliferation capacities, which result in failure of bone marrow hematopoietic functions. Although a majority of AML patients initially respond to standard induction therapy, a protocol that combines cytarabine (AraC) with an anthracycline, relapses are common and overall survival remains very poor [1] . Whole-genome sequencing analyses have highlighted the molecular heterogeneity of AML and allow for risk-based stratification [2] . For some mutations resulting in oncogenic signaling, specific inhibitors have been developed and are included in clinical strategies [3, 4] . Unfortunately, in the majority of cases these strategies show only transient and limited efficacy due to a variety of resistance mechanisms that occur in minor subpopulations of resistant leukemic cells which can initiate relapse [5] .

This process is closely regulated, antagonized by cysteine protease deubiquitinating enzymes (or DUBs), and is involved in multiple signaling [6] . Ubiquitin-specific protease 7 (USP7, also known as herpesvirus-associated ubiquitinspecific protease, or HAUSP) belongs to the largest subfamily of DUB and is one of the most studied, disease-associated DUBs [7] . It has been noted that USP7 participates in the regulation of apoptosis and senescence by modulating the p53 pathway, either by directly deubiquitinating p53 or by stabilizing MDM2, an E3-ubiquitin ligase that ubiquitinates and targets p53 for proteasomal degradation [8] . Independently of its action on p53, USP7 modulates various pathways in homeostasis or during oncogenesis by targeting a large panel of substrates involved in cell cycle, DNA damage response, immune response, signal transduction, neuronal differentiation, and epigenetic regulation [7, 9] . Other notable targets of USP7 include the tumor suppressor PTEN [10] and the transcription factor FOXO4 [11] . Through deubiquitination, USP7 triggers their nuclear exclusion and inactivation. Interestingly, in chronic myeloid leukemia, BCR-ABL phosphorylates USP7 and enhances its deubiquitinating activity on PTEN [12] . Therefore, it is evident that USP7 is at the center of a complex network, and recent efforts have focused on the discovery and development of small molecule inhibitors of this protein [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . These inhibitors were found to enhance apoptosis in chronic lymphocytic leukemia [20] and multiple myeloma [21] and to reduce neuroblastoma growth in vivo [22] .

Several studies consequently suggested USP7 as an attractive pharmaceutical target for various cancers, and pharmacological inhibitors of this enzyme have recently been developed [9, [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . In this study, we showed that USP7 plays a key role in AML chemoresistance. Furthermore, we observed heterogeneous USP7 levels in AML cell lines and primary samples and established that patients with a high USP7 signature were more prone to chemoresistance and relapse. Experiments using single-cell analysis support these findings by showing that the resistant gene signature is enriched in AML samples that exhibit high USP7 levels, which reveals that this chemoresistant cell population preexists at diagnosis and is enriched following first line treatment. Consequently, these data suggest that USP7 could be a new prognostic marker and a potential therapeutic target for AML. Our finding that USP7 inhibition in vitro and in vivo significantly suppresses leukemic cell growth, alone and in combination with chemotherapy, independently of p53 status supports this notion. Although p53 can be stabilized by USP7 [8] , it appears that in AML, which does not frequently present p53 mutations, cells do not rely on p53 stabilization. Despite the large spectrum of USP7 substrates, we showed that the cytotoxic effect caused by USP7 inhibition is mediated, at least in part, by a decrease in CHK1 function due to similar anti-leukemic effects with the CHK1 inhibitor SCH900776.

It will be important to investigate the mechanisms that control USP7 expression in the context of AML heterogeneity. In-depth analyses of the clinical and biological characteristics of AML patients revealed that USP7 expression significantly correlates with FLT3-ITD mutation. However, in our studies, we did not observe direct regulation of USP7 expression by the FLT3 tyrosine-kinase receptor, but this specific aspect will require further investigations in the future. Nevertheless, we established that USP7 transcript and protein abundance are highly correlated in AML samples, which suggests that the majority of USP7 regulation might occur at the transcriptional level. Previous reports have documented the transcriptional regulation of USP7, for instance in T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) in which the transcription factor NOTCH1 induces USP7 gene expression, and where USP7 controls the stability of NOTCH1 and the JMJD3 histone demethylase through a positive regulatory loop [37, 38] . It is noteworthy that the NOTCH-signaling pathway has been reported to play oncogenic and tumor suppressor functions in the hematopoietic system, although the biological and clinical relevance remains unclear in AML [39] . A potential regulatory and functional link between USP7 and NOTCH1 is supported by our transcriptomic analyses considering that Delta-like non-canonical Notch ligand 1 (DLK1) was upregulated in cells enriched in USP7 gene signature. DLK1 encodes the NOTCH activator Delta1 which is involved in primary and model AML cell growth [40] . Furthermore, previous analyses show a significantly shorter survival of patients with high NOTCH1 or Delta1 expression, suggesting that activation of the NOTCH pathway may be associated with a poor prognosis in AML [41, 42] . All these studies, combined with our data, suggest the existence of a NOTCH/USP7/CHK1 axis involved in AML chemoresistance, which should be investigated in future studies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1193, "end": 1197, "text": "[37,", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 1198, "end": 1201, "text": "38]", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1420, "end": 1424, "text": "[39]", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 1755, "end": 1759, "text": "[40]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 1977, "end": 1981, "text": "[41,", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}, {"start": 1982, "end": 1985, "text": "42]", "ref_id": "BIBREF46"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Finally, the large spectrum of USP7 substrates and its implication in fundamental cellular and developmental processes define USP7 as a highly important molecule.

Fig. 6 USP7 inhibition potentiates cytarabine treatment in AML cells. a HL-60 cells were treated with P22077 (10 \u00b5M), cytarabine (AraC, 300 nM) or a combination of both drugs, for 24 h. Cell death was assessed by flow cytometry with annexinV/cell viability staining using a MACSQuant VYB flow cytometer and FlowJo software. Statistical analysis was performed by unpaired t-test (n = 4). *P \u2264 0.05 and **P \u2264 0.01. b OCI-AML3 cells were treated as indicated for 24 h. Cell death was assessed as in a. Statistics were established by unpaired t-test (n = 3). *P \u2264 0.05, **P \u2264 0.01 and ns not significant. c, d Analyses of the clonogenic properties of high USP7 abundance (n = 6 primary samples, left panel) and low USP7 abundance (n = 5 primary samples, right panel) in AML blast cells with continuous exposure to 10 nM cytarabine (AraC) alone or in combination with 5 \u00b5M USP7 inhibitor (P22077). Colony formation was assessed after 7 days and represented as the ratio of the number of clones between untreated and treated conditions. For statistical analyses, an unpaired Wilcoxon test was used. *P \u2264 0.05, and ns not significant. e Proximity ligation assays were performed using anti-CHK1 and anti-USP7 antibodies in HL-60 cells treated with 10 \u00b5M of P22077 and/or 300 nM of cytarabine for 16 h. DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Z-stack images were acquired by confocal microscopy. f Quantification of PLA foci from three independent experiments was performed with ZEN and ImageJ software. For co-staining of CHK1 and USP7: mean = 1.07 \u00b1 0.07 foci/cell from 677 nuclei analyzed for the untreated condition (NT); mean = 3.31 \u00b1 0.21 foci/cell from 743 nuclei analyzed for cytarabine treatment; mean=0.68 \u00b1 0.04 foci/cell from 604 nuclei analyzed for P22077 treatment and mean = 1.24 \u00b1 0.10 foci/cell from 407 nuclei analyzed for combined treatment. P-values were determined using the unpaired t-test, ****P < 0.0001. g HL-60 cells were treated with the indicated treatment for 24 h.
