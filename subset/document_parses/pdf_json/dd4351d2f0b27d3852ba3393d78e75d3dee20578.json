Based on a previous symptomatic-asymptomatic-recoverer-dead differential equation model (SARDDE) and the clinic data of the first COVID-19 epidemic in Shanghai, this paper determines the parameters of SARDDE. Numerical simulations of SARDDE describe well the outcomes of current symptomatic individuals, recovered symptomatic individuals, and died individuals, respectively. The numerical simulations suggest that both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals cause lesser asymptomatic spread than symptomatic spread; blocking rate of about 95.5% cannot prevent the spread of the COVID19 epidemic in Shanghai. The strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Shanghai government is not only very effective but also completely necessary. The numerical simulations suggest also that using the data from the beginning to the day after about 19 days at the turning point can estimate well the following outcomes of the COVID-19 academic. It is expected that the research can provide better understanding, explaining, and dominating for epidemic spreads, prevention and control measures.",

(7) Simulations showed that using the data form the beginning to the day after about 19 days the turning points, one can estimate well or approximately the following outcomes of the first COVID-19 academic in Shanghai. (8) The strict prevention and control strategies implemented by Shanghai government is not only very effective but also completely necessary. (9) There are a large numbers of articles on the modeling and prediction of COVID-19 epidemics. To our knowledge, no such a model was used to describe the dynamics of the first COVID-19 in Shanghai. It is expected that the presented researches can provide better understanding , explaining, and dominating for epidemic spreads, preventions and controls not only in Shanghai but also in other regions.",

The numbers of cumulative recovered symptomatic and died individuals are about 338 and 4, respectively. The results suggest that using the data before the day 43 (about 19 days after the turning point) can approximately estimate the following outcome of the first COVID-19 academic in Shanghai.In summary, SARDDE model (1) can simulate the outcomes of the first COVID-19 epidemic in Shanghai. The calculated equation parameters can help us to understand and explain the mechanism of epidemic diseases and control strategies for the event of the practical epidemic.CI individuals: I(0)=2,I(4)=32,I(10)=122,I(16)=238,I(24)=255, I(43)=41,I(52)=14,I(70)=7,I(103)=0.
