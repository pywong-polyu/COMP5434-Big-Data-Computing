We aimed to investigate the rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection and its clinical features among infection-na\u00efve, infected, vaccinated, and postinfection-vaccinated individuals. A cohort was designed among icddr,b staff registered for COVID-19 testing by real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR). Reinfection cases were confirmed by whole-genome sequencing. From 19 March 2020 to 31 March 2021, 1644 (mean age, 38.4 years and 57% male) participants were enrolled; where 1080 (65.7%) were tested negative and added to the negative cohort. The positive cohort included 750 positive patients (564 from baseline and 186 from negative cohort follow-up), of whom 27.6% were hospitalized and 2.5% died. Among hospitalized patients, 45.9% had severe to critical disease and 42.5% required oxygen support. Hypertension and diabetes mellitus were found significantly higher among the hospitalised patients compared to out-patients; risk ratio 1.3 and 1.6 respectively. The risk of infection among positive cohort was 80.2% lower than negative cohort (95% CI 72.6-85.7%; p < 0.001). Genome sequences showed that genetically distinct SARS-CoV-2 strains were responsible for reinfections. Naturally infected populations were less likely to be reinfected by SARS-CoV-2 than the infection-na\u00efve and vaccinated individuals. Although, reinfected individuals did not suffer severe disease, a remarkable proportion of naturally infected or vaccinated individuals were (re)-infected by the emerging variants.",

At least one comorbidity among obesity, diabetes, asthma, heart disease, lung disease, and high blood pressure (BP) was present in 19 (50%) reinfection cases. During episode-2, confirm contact with another COVID-19 patient was higher than episode-1 (14 vs. 8) . Although several mild symptoms were recorded for primary infection and reinfection (Appendix 1E), no one required hospitalisation except one (case-25) during primary infection and one (case-16) during reinfection. The hospitalisation case during primary infection (case 25) and reinfection (case 7) was not severe Nearly complete genome sequences from both episode-1 and episode-2 infections were retrieved from 18 reinfections out of 38 cases. The amino acid sequence comparison among the strains from episode-1 and episode-2 with reference Wuhan strain (GenBank Accession# NC_045512.2) is shown in Fig. 4 . The sequencing results revealed that the reinfection was caused by a different (PANGO Lineage) strain than the first infection, except one (case-08). For case numbers 09, 10 and 12, both episodes were caused by the same Wuhan-like variant while others were caused by different variants than first infections. The case-16 was infected by the Wuhan-like variant in episode-1 and by the Alpha variant in episode-2, which was the only severe case during reinfection. Case numbers 17, 20, 21, 24, 26 were reinfected by Beta variant, and case numbers 27, 30, 32, 36, 37 were reinfected by Delta variant, while all these cases were first infected by Wuhan-like variant. Case numbers 28, 31 and 34 were infected by Beta in episode-1 and reinfected by Delta variant. Case-08 was the only case infected and reinfected by the same PANGO Lineage (B.1.1.25); however, three amino acids were different between episode-1 and episode-2. The case was asymptomatic and tested positive on 6 September 2020 as confirmed contact with another COVID-19 patient. After 20 days, on 26 September, the follow-up rRT-PCR test was negative. On 23 October 2020, after 47 days from episode-1, the case was found positive with high fever, cough, diarrhoea, and muscle aches. Thus, the case was confirmed as reinfection by the definition provided in Appendix 1B. Among the positive cases, no one required medical attention except three who had co-morbidites. Two vaccinated individuals had high blood pressure, attended the hospital and were discharged with conventional COVID-19 medication after a few hours of observation. Another case was non-vaccinated and had asthma with thyroiditis, which required oxygen support with a nasal cannula. ",

We did a systematic search to identify studies that described clinical characteristics and/or potential factors and/or rates for recurrence of positive SARS-CoV-2 (Appendix 1A). A total of 22 cohorts were identified, and no cohort confirmed reinfection by whole-genome sequencing. In addition, among 118 published case reports, only 12 confirmed reinfections by whole-genome sequencing. Therefore, our cohort is unique in identifying reinfection cases with genomic evidence, which is essential to confirm true reinfections. Here we have provided evidence that: (1) being naturally infected confers better protection against the SARS-CoV-2; (2) SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with an 80% lower risk for concurrent infection, with more than six-month protective effect after primary infection; (3) COVISHIELD\u2122 vaccine showed reduced effectiveness against new variants of SARS-CoV-2.",

The significantly higher infection rate among infection na\u00efve participants than patients previously infected with SARS-CoV-2 indicates possible protection by natural infections. Mean rRT-PCR Ct-value during episode-1 of reinfected cases was significantly higher than others. Also, the fact that the mean Ct-value of the symptomatic cases was found to be significantly lower than asymptomatic ones, similar to another study 46 , indicates that a relatively low Ct-value or high viral load was required to develop COVID-19-like symptoms [47] [48] [49] as well as for seroconversion 11, 50 .",
