This process may be guided by various factors, including the network topology [26] , type of propagated behavior, nature of social contacts, and other features of the social environment. The majority of recent studies on this topic are concentrated on the structural properties of the networks that drive the behavior diffusion processes. For example, it was experimentally shown that short average path length and high clustering cause a faster behavior spread [27] that can be explained by the formation of the dense network communities with the fast information and behavior exchange within these cohesive groups. In [28] it was demonstrated that there are differences in spreading processes initiated by well-connected actors, or hubs, and by actors with a few social connections. Hubs are effective in information propagation due to the high number of connections, while actors with a few ties are more efficient in spreading messages that are controversial or costly. The probability of behavior adoption by an individual is also highly correlated with the number of social contacts that directly influence this individual [29] . The influence by many peers, or so-called \"complex contagion\", results in faster and easier behavior adoption, rather than the influence by one person, or \"simple contagion\" [26] . The efficacy of social contagion is often associated with the type of propagated behavior. Centola and Macy outline the danger of considering the social contagion studies in the 'whatever to be diffused' way [30] . For example, the adoption of information is much less risky, costly, and time-consuming, rather than the adoption of health-related behavior, sports habits, and academic achievements.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 142, "end": 146, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 526, "end": 530, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 684, "end": 688, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1193, "end": 1197, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1374, "end": 1378, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1589, "end": 1593, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Literature review"}, {"text": "The nature of social ties is also a significant factor for behavior transmission.

Strong ties are formed within the dense network communities such as family or friends, while weak ties, according to Granovetter's definition, emerge during the whole life and represent people who are marginally included in the network of contacts, such as old college friends or colleagues [31] . Empirical literature shows that both types of relationships can serve as channels for the diffusion of behavior or information [1, 20] .

Networks can be based on friendship, romantics, advice seeking, social support, and many other relationships.

This report showed that students tend to obtain similar grades as their peers, classmates, and friends, and this effect remains strong after controlling for a variety of socio-economic and cognitive variables. Further empirical studies demonstrated the presence of this effect in various case studies. For example, it was shown that student grade point average (GPA) increases if her dormmate is in the highest 25th GPA percentile [32] . In [15] , MBA students tend to assimilate the grades of their friends and advisers. It was also demonstrated that this social influence is associated with the personal characteristics of students and the nature of their social connections. For instance, lower-achieving students are more influenced by their peers [33, 34] , the diffusion of academic performance is stronger among women than men [35] , can be related to the race of a peer [36, 37] , and is stronger from close peers such as friends [38] .

Ties in the friendship network transmit academic achievements, while ties in the study assistance network do not. The absence of the social influence process along the presence of social selection in the study assistance network may suggest the presence of social segregation based on performance [19] . This can be related to the high competitiveness of the university environment under the study. We expect that some students are highly motivated to receive higher grades and prefer to invest time and effort in their high academic results rather than help their less academically successful peers. Our findings demonstrate that the efficacy of academic achievements diffusion is determined by the nature of the social network. It was established that social integration in the classroom is positively associated with the higher academic performance of students [17, 19] . Here we claim that it is extremely important to integrate individuals specifically in the network of informal friendship interactions and motivate them to create connections with higher-performing students. These findings support the idea that the nature of social relationships is crucial for the transmission of specific types of information and behavior in social networks. Close friendship relationships serve as effective channels for the spread of various complex behaviors, including very costly behavior types such as health behavior [1] . Academic performance is one of the examples of these behavior types that are not easily transmittable. In contrast, the instrumental study assistance ties do not produce the propagation of academic achievements from successful students to their lower-performing peers. To sum up, we show that costly and complex behavior (such as academic achievement) diffuses more effectively in the network of strong close connections such as friendship. These findings contribute to the current debates on behavior propagation in social networks and propose new insights on factors that impact the success of behavior transmission.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 398, "end": 402, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 965, "end": 969, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 970, "end": 973, "text": "19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1518, "end": 1521, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PLOS ONE"}, {"text": "This study has several limitations.

This time frame, when students start their educational path at an undergraduate level, receives a lot of attention in the literature [17, 19, 42] due to the fast speed of social tie formation. At the same time, it would be beneficial to investigate the diffusion of academic achievements through social networks along the full period of studies. Second, we examine only two types of social relations, however, the spectrum of social ties that can serve as channels of the performance diffusion is much wider. It is a potential avenue for future studies to estimate the efficacy of other types of social networks such as cooperation, competition, romantic relationships, and negative ties on the process of academic achievement diffusion. The data on some of these networks is difficult to collect (e.g., negative relationships) due to the high sensitivity of studied relationships but these types of ties can be nevertheless significant for behavior transmission.

One of the possible mechanisms of performance increase is social influence, as we show in this paper. Teachers can pay additional attention to the development of informal friendship relationships between students with various performance levels during classes. It can be reached by group work assignments, in which group membership is defined by the teachers and is not based on the personal preferences of students. Long-term group assignments such as working on a research project together can stimulate students from different achievement groups to develop friendship ties with each other. The creation of recreation and open spaces within the university building can also give additional options for students with distinct performance to meet, interact, and form friendship ties. The combination of these actions would help students to build and sustain their informal networks, which, in turn, serve as key channels of the academic performance diffusion and lead to a positive behavior change.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 156, "end": 160, "text": "[43,", "ref_id": "BIBREF43"}, {"start": 161, "end": 164, "text": "44]", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 344, "end": 348, "text": "[45]", "ref_id": "BIBREF45"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PLOS ONE"}, {"text": "Supporting information S1 File.
