Since then, physical distancing measures such as confinement have been adopted by different governments to control human to human transmission. This study aimed to determine how confinement affects children's routines, more specifically their physical activity (PA) and sedentary time. An online survey was launched to assess how Portuguese children under 13 years of age adjusted their daily routines to confinement. Parents reported the time each child was engaged in different activities throughout the day, which was used to calculate overall sedentary time and overall physical activity time. Based on the data of 2159 children, our study showed that during confinement: (i) there was a decrease in children's physical activity time and an increase in screen time and family activities; (ii) boys engaged in more playful screen Time than girls (p < 0.05), and girls played more without PA than boys (p < 0.05); (iii) along the age groups, there was a trend for an increase of the overall sedentary time and an associated decrease of the overall physical activity time. In summary, PA of confined children showed low levels and a clear decreasing trend along childhood. Conjoint family and societal strategies to target specific age groups should be organized in the future.",

Portugal responded quickly to the coming menace. The first case was reported on the last week of February 2020 and, on March 16, schools, companies, and non-essential public services were closed across the country. Two days later, the state of emergency was declared by the Portuguese President. Restrictions on circulation were imposed for the entire population, all shops were closed (except for supermarkets, pharmacies, and gas stations), and restaurants could only operate as take-away. Despite the benefit of preventing high rates of the virus transmission, being in quarantine is an unpleasant experience, since it gives a feeling of loss of freedom, boredom, and uncertainty over disease status, affecting one's health status (Mattioli et al. 2020) . During this time, people are likely to experience fear, helplessness, and stigma (Jeong et al. 2016) , and with the closure of schools and businesses, such emotions can become exacerbated (Hall et al. 2008; Rubin et al. 2010) .",

Children, who used to spend their days at school and playing outside, were suddenly confronted with a homeschooling program, locked in their homes. This signaled the beginning of a long period of movement restriction, with no organized physical activity (PA), no free playtime outdoors, and no opportunities to spend time with friends. School programs for primary-school children and most secondaryschool children were transferred to a mixed system of broadcast television and on-line home schooling from April to June, and all sports/leisure activities were suspended until September. Although quick walks and outdoor playtime (20 min) were permitted during the confinement, all outside playgrounds were closed and children were encouraged to maintain social distance between themselves. The confinement period was quite effective in reducing the virus spread in Portugal, so a gradual lifting of the emergency measures led to the reopening of daycares on May 18, 2020, and preschools on June 1, 2020. However, many families with younger children whose parents were still working from home, decided that their children would only go back to school in September.",

            "text": "In non-quarantine conditions, measured data on PA shows that only 36% of Portuguese children aged 10-11 years accomplished the WHO PA guidelines of 60 min per day of moderate-to-vigorous PA (Baptista et al. 2012) and, although 61.8% of 6-to 9-year-old children and 59% of 10-to 17-year-old youths practice some form of organized sports at least once per week (Lopes et al. 2017 ), school has a major role in promoting PA habits in this population. In Portugal, Physical Education (PE) classes are mandatory for all students, from pre-school until the 12th grade. Time allocated to PE classes ranges from 90 to 150 min/week over 2 or 3 sessions/week and are taught by a certified PE teacher (Mota et al. 2018) . Considering other PA habits of Portuguese children, some points deserve further consideration. Portugal has low levels of independent mobility (i.e., children's freedom to get about and play in their neighborhood unaccompanied by adults), and screen time is popular among children and adolescents. For example, 76.6% of the children between 6-and 10-years old commute by car to school, and only 17.5% walk or cycle to school. On weekdays 22% of children spend more than 1 h a day watching TV or using electronic devices, and this percentage more than triples at weekends (79%) (Lopes et al. 2017) . When compared to other countries, Portuguese children rank low in their levels of independent mobility. In a study with 16 countries published in 2015 (Shaw et al. 2015) , Portugal ranked in 14th place, along with Italy and just before South Africa, as the countries with less independent mobility. More recently, results from the WHO Childhood Obesity Surveillance Initiative (COSI), which provide an overview of the PA habits of children in the WHO European Region, showed that Portuguese children were the ones with the lowest levels of active travel to school (Whiting et al. 2020) . Conversely, although most Portuguese children spent about 1 h a day watching TV or using electronic devices, their levels of screen time involvement were not as high as in most other countries (Whiting et al. 2020) .",

But little is known about the motor behaviors of the Portuguese children through the weeks of confinement. We recently published data from a similar study (Pombo et al. 2020) , which found that such as younger age, access to a large outdoor space, presence of other children in the household and at least one nonworking adult at home, positively influenced the percentage of physical activity done by children during confinement. However, a more complete description of the Portuguese children's routines during confinement has not yet been presented. This study fills that gap in the preceding literature, intending to describe the Portuguese children's routines during confinement that is not presented in the previous article. Nowadays, we are seeing the acute effects of the confinement in children's behaviors but, we still do not know what future will bring. In that sense, we feel that this description is fundamental, not only to understand the implications of this confinement in children's health, but it can also lay the foundations for future studies in this field.",

We decided to focus on children under age 13 because even though families are always important in the upbringing of their children, in the younger ages the role of parents and families is fundamental. In fact, in Portugal the law recognizes this role and, for that reason, parents with children up to 12 years of age have specific privileges to give assistance to their children when needed.",

The result showed that a sample of 74 participants was required to achieve a power of 0.80. Descriptive statistics and frequency analysis were used to describe children's living environments and routines during this period. Five categories of activities were analysed: intellectual activity (school assignments and online classes); playful screen time (games, movies, social networks, internet, audio, and video calls); play without physical activity (reading, drawing, painting, board games, cards, Legos, etc.); play with physical activity (hide and seek, jumping, running, etc.); physical activity (organized physical activity indoors, physical activity outdoors, walking the dog). The first three categories (intellectual activity, playful screen time, and play without physical activity) were added to calculate overall sedentary time, and the last two categories (play with physical activity and physical activity) were added to calculate overall physical activity time.",

The increase in sedentary behaviors and screen time, alongside the decrease of PA, is a serious concern. In schoolaged children, sedentary behavior has been associated with inadequate body composition, decreased fitness, lower selfesteem and pro-social behavior, and decreased academic achievement (Tremblay et al. 2017) . Reduced PA during childhood also hast long-term implications. As a child ages, the relationship between PA and motor competence (MC) becomes more reciprocal. Higher levels of MC foster more PA and, reciprocally, more PA fosters greater MC, this creates a positive spiral of engagement in PA across childhood, into adolescence bringing the healthy habits to adulthood (Stodden et al., 2008) . (Epstein et al. 2000) , but also to help to satisfy some of the children's basic psychological needs, like social connectedness, self-acceptance, and purpose in life (Rodriguez-Ayllon et al. 2019) .",

First, physical education is mandatory, although school offer varies regarding the number of hours children have PE during the week (from 90 to 150 min/per week). Second, school sports clubs exist in most schools. These clubs work as extra-curricular activities, which offer structured practice under the supervision of a PE teacher and have within and between school competitions. Finally, recess is generally viewed as a time for students to be active, so in most schools, few restrictions to movement are imposed during that time (Mota et al. 2018) . The role of school as an important environment to promote children's PA is highlighted by the fact that when Portuguese children do not go to school, their average PA time drops for less than half of the total time reported by accelerometry during school days, which is about 5.0 h for boys and 4.5 h for girls (Marques et al. 2016) .",

It is important to emphasize that, we do not know if all children were affected in the same magnitude. We do not have any direct data regarding the social-economic status of the children or their accessibility to a computer and the internet. In Spain, middle-class families were able to maintain higher standards of education quality, while children from socially disadvantaged families had few learning opportunities both in terms of time and learning experiences (Bonal and Gonz\u00e1lez 2020) .

Moreover, prolonged homestay can lead to an increase in sedentary behaviors, such as spending excessive amounts of time sitting, reclining, or lying down for screening activities (playing games, watching television, using mobile devices); reducing regular PA (hence having lower energy expenditure); or engaging in activities that, consequently, lead to an increased health risk (Owen et al. 2010) .",

Parents play an important role as health behavior models for children, and active parents bring up more physically active children (Sigmund et al. 2008) . So, physical activity family-centered interventions, that can be done within the home environment, are important for healthy living and should be promoted during the coronavirus crisis or any other similar crisis in the future. Involving children in family activities, such as physically active games, walks in nature (following public health recommendations), and engaging in daily outside sports activity should be encouraged. (2) Playtime can also be used to improve more intense movement involvement. Combining movement and story-telling interventions enhance motor competence (Duncan et al. 2019) , which is a key contributor to children's physical, cognitive and social development, and provides the foundations for healthy living trajectories (Lubans et al. 2010 ). (3) Replace leisure screen time by active screen time (Tremblay et al. 2017) in which children are encouraged to engage in PA, can be another viable solution. Active video games (AVGs), also called \"exergames\", are video games that require movement or physical exertion (Kann et al. 2018) . Studies have shown that playing AVGs over short periods of time is similar to light-to-moderate physical activities (Biddiss and Irwin 2010; Wagener et al. 2012 ). However, play and PA away from screens should be the parent's first choice for their children, when possible.",

First, it is a cross-sectional study design and thus susceptible to biases. Second, it is a parental report online and not a direct or quantifiable observation of the time children spent in each activity. We believe that these methodological options were necessary considering the confinement situation we were living in. Lastly, the fact that we could not collect any data on the SES of the respondents was a limitation. We do have indirect indicators, such as the type of house, but we do not really know the SES of the respondents, which is probably an influent factor in the way families dealt with the confinement. Along the confinement period, different attempts to improve movement time and quality within the households appeared. Social media, YouTube channels, television programs, social influencers, organized groups (e.g., sports clubs, health clubs, universities, government health authorities, etc.), and many others tried to deliver to families and children the best ideas to help them keep active and healthy. The final consequences of this forced living style will be lived long after the end of the confinement, but a better understanding of the effects will only be possible if a thorough description of this period is possible. With this study, we hope to contribute to characterize the Portuguese children's PA routines during the confinement period, but also to offer possible ways for changing the families' present situation.",
