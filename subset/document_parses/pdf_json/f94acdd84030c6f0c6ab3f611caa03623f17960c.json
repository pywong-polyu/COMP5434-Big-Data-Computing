It addresses the most relevant health and welfare problems and reviews their potential hazards and associated risk factors. Regarding health, problems related to post weaning diarrhoea, cold stress, skin lesions, endoparasites and post weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome are described. Reasons for distress and frustration in weaned piglets are identified as mainly separation from the mother, a new environment, mixing and fear of humans. Finally, hazards and risk factors for health and welfare in organic weaners are related to animal characteristics, housing systems, feed/nutrition and management. Generally, it is concluded that diseases around weaning are multifactorial in nature, with several factors contributing simultaneously as stressors at the time of weaning. In order to solve problems around weaning, the complexity and the individuality of farm systems need to be taken into account.",

This contrasts with the situation in commercial pig production, where weaning is a particular critical period in the life of a piglet, involving exposure to numerous stressors at the same time. Among others, separation of piglets and sows results in a change in the piglets' diet, not only in relation to the nutritional composition but also a change from liquid to solid feed. The piglets are no longer protected by passive immunity from the sow's milk or by heat from the sows' body when resting. Further stressors include challenges through changes in the microbial flora in the environment, changes in climatic conditions and challenges from new physical and social environments associated with possible relocation and mixing.",

            "text": "There are significant differences in the management of weaning between organic and conventional pig production. The biggest of these is the age at weaning, but there are also differences in the lactation environment and the housing conditions for the newly weaned piglet. Table 1 illustrates the large diversity of weaning procedures which is present in organic pig production throughout Europe. In most organic systems, weaning is performed by physically separating the sow and piglets when the piglets are 40 days old, which is the minimum weaning age specified by Council Regulation (834/2007) . In some countries, piglets are weaned at an older age dictated by national certification bodies. In addition, many organic farmers move their piglets to a different location at the time of weaning, thereby subjecting the piglets to further potential stressors such as handling, transportation and a different bacterial load. In many countries, weaners, growers and fatteners in organic systems are kept in indoor systems with access to concrete outdoor runs. Consequently, the change in environment can be rather dramatic in the systems practising outdoor farrowing and indoor weaning. Finally, weaning often involves regrouping the piglets by mixing different litters, resulting in social instability as new group hierarchies have to be formed. This paper will review the available information on the different animal health and welfare issues in organic pigs in relation to weaning. It will address the prevalence of the most relevant health problems and will review their potential hazards and associated risk factors.",

In combination with the occurrence of infectious diseases, the prevalence of diseases related to the weaning process is expected to differ considerably within and between countries. So far, only a few studies have dealt with the prevalence of disease or welfare problems in organic weaners. In a survey including farmers from Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and England, the predominant health problems reported around weaning were respiratory diseases (NL, D, DK), diarrhoea (D, DK, NL), arthritis (NL, D) and endoparasites (DK), while English farmers reported that insufficient feed intake is a bigger problem than infectious diseases (Bonde and S\u00f8rensen 2006) . Porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome, post-weaning multisystemic wasting syndrome (PMWS) and keeping the stock dry during periods of heavy rainfall were mentioned as primary concerns in another survey conducted in England (Day et al. 2003) . Nordic veterinarians and advisors highlighted poor quality of feed (>50 % of herds), lack of wallowing facilities (25-50 %), diarrhoea (25-50 %), joint infections (<25 %), meningitis (<25 %), respiratory problems (<25 %) and tail biting (<25 %) as the main health and welfare problems at this production stage (Bonde and S\u00f8rensen 2004) .",

            "text": "Diarrhoea is a multifactorial disease, resulting from the combination of a challenged digestive system, a challenged immune system and various stressors during the weaning process. While, in the past, scientists primarily focussed on specific pathogens found in conjunction with symptoms of diarrhoea (Carpenter and Burlatschenko 2005; Jacobson et al. 2003; Wieler et al. 2001) , there is increasing evidence that the presence of pathogens is only one out of a long list of factors involved (Lall\u00e8s et al. 2007a,b) . Most studies concerning post-weaning diarrhoea have been performed in conventional systems, characterised by an early weaning age and by housing conditions with a high stocking density and without litter. In these studies, numerous risk factors for postweaning diarrhoea (PWD) have been identified as follows: 'pre-weaning diarrhoea', 'larger litters', 'low weaning weight', 'low weaning age', 'low creep feed intake', 'cleanliness of the weaning pen', 'temperature of the weaning pen', 'air quality', group size', 'stocking procedure', and 'feed intake of the piglets during the first week post weaning ' (Svensmark et al. 1989; Madec et al. 1998; Skirrow et al. 1997) . In conventional systems, weaning diarrhoea is seen 3-10 days after weaning, typically involving proliferation of haemolytic Escherichia coli (Carstensen et al. 2005) . Often multiple concurrent pathogens are involved. Differential diagnoses for diarrhoea in weaned pigs include salmonellosis, swine dysentery, porcine proliferative enteropathy caused by Lawsonia intracellularis, rotavirus and coronavirus enteritis, post-weaning colibacillosis, trichuriasis, coccidiosis and porcine colonic spirochetosis caused by Brachyspira pilosicoli (Carpenter and Burlatschenko 2005) . The symptoms are not confined to the gut but can overlap with disturbances of other organs and tissues. According to Svensmark et al. (1989) , diarrhoea is often associated with an increased incidence of diseases of the skin and respiratory tract.",

Although risk of post weaning diarrhoea has been shown to decrease with increasing weaning weight and age (Madec et al. 1998) , the minimum weaning age of 40+ days in organic systems is still considerably earlier than under semi-natural conditions and thus at least some of the developmental/maturity problems are likely to still be of relevance.",

            "text": "Another potential welfare implication of weaning, especially during cold seasons, is thermal discomfort when the piglets cannot benefit from the heating capacity of the sow's body heat. This is a likely reason for the regional differences seen in weaning systems with respect to whether weaners are kept inside or outside. In general, the southern European countries wean outdoors while northern European countries, except UK, wean into indoor systems with outdoor runs. A problem with keeping the outdoor stock dry during periods of heavy rainfall was mentioned as a primary concern in a survey conducted in England (Day et al. 2003) . The reduced feed intake which occurs when the piglet is forced to make an early transition from milk to a diet with only solid feed results in an increase in the lower critical temperature and hence greater susceptibility to cold stress. Whilst a later weaning age reduces the extent of this deficit in energy intake, it has still been shown to occur when piglets are weaned at 6 weeks of age (Wellock et al. 2007 ) and may be more marked if the feed is of lower nutrient density and palatability, as can be the case in some organic systems because of limitations on permitted ingredients.",

The prevalences of Ascaris in 10-12-week-old weaners in Denmark have thus been found to vary with the production system, being 1 % in intensive indoor herds (conventional), 10 % in traditional indoor herds (conventional), 50 % in pioneering organic herds and 28 % in second generation organic herds, respectively (Roepstorff et al. 1998; Roepstorff et al. 1992; Carstensen et al. 2002) . In comparison, 67 % of 8-12week-old pigs were positive for Ascaris in Swedish outdoor herds (Christensson 1996) , whereas organic weaners in a Dutch study were at the borderline of being too young to have detectable patent infections (Eijck and Borgsteede 2005) . Even though the more professional management within Danish organic herds thus seems to have reduced the prevalence of Ascaris in weaners from 1991-1992 to 2000, this age group is still heavily infected. This may in part reflect that some Ascaris eggs may survive for 9 years on pastures (Krasnonos 1978) and exposure is thus impossible to avoid if pigs are born outside and permanent pastures are used or pasture rotation schemes are too short.",

As pigs do acquire a very strong resistance, Trichuris usually only have a restricted period of egg excretion, varying from 5-8 weeks, before the worms are completely expelled (Roepstorff and Murrell 1997; Pedersen and Saeed 2001; Kringel and Roepstorff 2006) . In pioneering organic herds in Denmark, only 1 herd out of 12 was heavily infected (weaner prevalence 79 %, Roepstorff et al. 1992 ), while 2 out of 9 of the second generation organic herds had highly infected weaners (10-50 %, Carstensen et al. 2003) . Similarly, weaners from one of ten Swedish outdoor farms were positive for Trichuris (Christensson 1996) . It is notable that all heavily infected Danish herds were established \u22655 years before the study, which means that Trichuris eggs had time to accumulate in the soil and that the pigs may have had the opportunity to return to previously contaminated areas. Werner et al. (2009) conducted a study to assess the hygienic measures used on organic pig farms and to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing endoparasite infections on 20 organic pig-breeding farms in Germany. Management factors related to helminth infections of the herds were recorded in personal interviews. The majority of the farrowing units (n=15) were cleaned wet, whereas most of the farmers did not clean the gestation pens at all and, if so, only mechanically by removing dung. Chemical disinfection was only performed in farrowing units in at most 20 % of the farms. Strongylid, Trichuris suis and Ascaris suum eggs were detected in 78.5, 2.8 and 1.3 %, respectively. Regarding the worm control and hygiene management, there were no differences between strongylid free or infected farms. Thus, those farms who used comprehensive hygiene measures were not necessarily gaining the best results with respect to endoparasite infection. The authors concluded that, without the implementation of a strategic control and feedback mechanism within the production process, effectiveness of hygiene measures related to worm burden cannot be assessed sufficiently.",

(1999) reported that belly nosing behaviour was initiated a short time after weaning and that the frequency increased during the following weeks. Additionally, these authors found that aggression increases after weaning (Andersen et al. 1999; Fraser 1978) . These behavioural changes indicate that weaned piglets experience distress or frustration due to an unsatisfied motivation to suckle (Van Putten and Dammers 1976; Fraser 1978) , social factors (Petersen et al. 1995) or a restrictive environment (Dybkjaer 1992 ). As mentioned above, piglets may experience a range of stressors when weaned. Compared to natural conditions, weaning is an abrupt and premature termination of the mother-offspring relationship. Typically, weaners are additionally moved to other housing systems-some from outdoor to indoor systems-increasing the risk of experiencing distress due to handling, transport, and a new environment, and finally mixing of litters is a frequently used procedure increasing the risk of social competition. Depending on the exact weaning procedure, the welfare implications of weaning can be increased stress responsiveness, frustration, aggression or development of stereotypic behaviour (as discussed by Latham and Mason 2008; Weary et al. 2008 ). The lactation environment in itself can further influence the welfare implications of weaning, as animals reared in more enriched environments tend to be better capable of coping with weaning (H\u00f6tzel et al. 2004; O'Connel et al. 2005 ).",

The aggression and associated injuries can be reduced if piglets are mixed in the suckling period (Pitts et al. 2000; Weary et al. 2002) when they more easily form new social hierarchies (D'Eath 2005) . Also, the physical environment during lactation affects the behaviour of piglets when mixed, as several studies point to a lower level of aggression when mixing piglets reared outside or in enriched pens (Cox and Cooper 2001; Weary et al. 2008) . This can be a consequence of specific social skills learned by the piglets when intermingling with other older and younger litters, or due to improved capacity to cope with novel challenges in animals exposed to a more complex social and physical environment (as discussed by Cox and Cooper 2001) . In many outdoor farrowing systems, the piglets benefit from an enriched environment and they are capable of moving between paddocks, thereby becoming familiarised with other litters before weaning.",

It was found that weaned piglets, with existing foot injuries from the farrowing house floor, recovered quickly in deep bedded pens. The authors concluded from the experiments that solid floors, particularly with bedding, benefit welfare since fewer foot injuries were recorded. With weaners, appetitive behaviour directed at the belly of other piglets, known as belly-nosing, as well as other oral behaviour directed at pen mates, are also reduced if they are offered straw (McKinnon et al. 1989; Kelly et al. 2000b ).

In farm practise, the feeding regime and nutrient supply before and after weaning varies to a high degree between farms. While in many farm systems piglets go through a period of anorexia immediately after weaning, farms may provide a restricted ration or feed the piglets ad libitum. Also, the diet composition can vary across a wide range from lowquality feed with respect to the digestibility, to special diets exclusively composed to help the piglets through this critical life stage. Thus, change of the diet from milk to solid feed can be associated with more or less weaning distress. Beside the intake of solid feed, the piglets must learn to recognise and drink water when weaned. A change in type of water dispenser at weaning to a nipple or bite drinker can result in a temporary decrease in water consumption, although unhygienic troughs are avoided in such systems (Phillips and Phillips 1999; S\u00f8rensen et al. 1994) .

Organic farmers often make use of home-grown cereals and grain legumes to formulate farm-specific diets (Dietze et al. 2007 ). Different legume protein sources vary considerably in relation to their impacts on nutrient digestibility, intestinal morphology and digestive enzyme activity in weaned piglets (Salgado et al. 2002) . The protein profile of legume seeds is characterised by a relative deficiency in sulphur amino acids and tryptophan and by the presence of antinutritional factors (ANF; e.g. protease inhibitors, lectins, tannins or alkaloids) (Gatel 1994) . ANFs can be responsible for a reduced feed intake and a lower digestibility, which can also be partly explained by reduced accessibility of legume seed protein to digestive enzymes (Godfrey et al. 1985; Gatel 1994) . Due to the restricted availability of feedstuffs with a high content of limiting amino acids and a high digestibility, growth rates and protein accretion are clearly lower in organic compared to conventional production (Sundrum et al. 2005) . Within the organic framework conditions, different measures are at the farmer's disposal to optimise the use of limited resources and to adapt the supply of limited amino acids to the growth process.",

Additionally, 'poor hygienic quality of feed and water' and 'too few drinking places' were contributory causes (Bonde and S\u00f8rensen 2004) . In various studies, the occurrence of post-weaning diarrhoea has been associated with poor pen hygiene (Rantzer and Svendsen 2001; Madec et al. 1998 ). Onfarm assessments on organic pig farms often revealed suboptimal hygiene conditions and deficiencies in the hygiene management and in the nutrient regime, although varying in their details considerably between the farms (Dietze et al. 2007 ). Thus, effective clinical management of PWD includes the identification of risk factors and the implementation of changes aimed at reducing the incidence. The development of diagnostic tools to be used at the farm level should be encouraged to enable appropriate and prompt counteractive measures.",
