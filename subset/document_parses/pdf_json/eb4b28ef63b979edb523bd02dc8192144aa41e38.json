Here, we present the X-ray crystal structure of TMEV 2A and define how it recognises the stimulatory RNA element. We demonstrate a critical role for bases upstream of the originally predicted stem-loop, providing evidence for a pseudoknotlike conformation and suggesting that the recognition of this pseudoknot by beta-shell proteins is a conserved feature in cardioviruses. Through examination of PRF in TMEV-infected cells by ribosome profiling, we identify a series of ribosomal pauses around the site of PRF induced by the 2A-pseudoknot complex. Careful normalisation of ribosomal profiling data with a 2A knockout virus facilitated the identification, through disome analysis, of ribosome stacking at the TMEV frameshifting signal. These experiments provide unparalleled detail of the molecular mechanisms underpinning Theilovirus proteinstimulated frameshifting.",

            "text": "Several 'non-canonical' translation events occur during the production of the TMEV polyprotein. First, initiation is directed by a type II internal ribosome entry site (IRES) in the 5 untranslated region (UTR) (7, 8) . Secondly, a cotranslational StopGo or ribosome 'skipping' event occurs at the junction between the 2A and 2B gene products (9, 10) . In this process, the peptidyl-transferase reaction fails between the glycine and proline in a conserved D(V/I)ExNPG|P motif, releasing the upstream L-1ABCD-2A product as the ribosome continues translating the downstream 2BC-3ABCD region. Note that in TMEV, however, the presence of a 3C protease cleavage site near the start of the 2B protein appears to make the occurrence of StopGo functionally redundant (11, 12) . Thirdly, programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting (PRF) diverts a proportion of ribosomes out of the polyprotein reading frame and into a short overlapping ORF, termed 2B*, near the start of 2B. In TMEV this ORF is only eight codons in length and the resulting transframe product 2B* has just 14 amino acids (\u223c1.4 kDa), with no established functional role (11) . Thus it has been hypothesised that in TMEV, the main function of PRF may simply be to downregulate translation of the enzymatic proteins encoded downstream of the frameshift site, particularly in the late stages of infection (11) .",

            "text": "PRF is common amongst RNA viruses, where it is used as a translational control strategy to express gene products in optimal ratios for efficient virus replication. Additionally, the utilisation of overlapping ORFs permits more information to be encoded by a small genome. Our mechanistic understanding of PRF has been informed by the study of examples in hundreds of viruses (reviewed in refs [13] [14] [15] . Generally, PRF involves two elements within the viral messenger RNA (mRNA). A heptameric shift site or 'slippery sequence' of the form X XXY YYZ (where XXX represents any three identical nucleotides or certain other triplets such as GGU, YYY represents AAA or UUU, and Z is any nucleotide except G) (16) is located 5--9 nucleotides upstream of a structured RNA 'stimulatory element' (usually a stemloop or pseudoknot) that impedes the progress of the elongating ribosome, such that the ribosome pauses with the shift site in the decoding centre (17) (18) (19) . This can facilitate a change of reading frame if the codon-anticodon interactions of the P-site and A-site tRNAs slip and recouple in the \u22121 frame (XXY \u2192 XXX and YYZ \u2192 YYY, respectively) during resolution of the stimulatory element. For any given system, such PRF generates a fixed ratio of products set by parameters that include the energetics of codonanticodon pairing at the shift site, the conformational flexibility of the stimulatory element and the resistance of this element to unwinding by the ribosomal helicase (20, 21) . In cardioviruses, however, PRF exhibits some intriguing mechanistic exceptions. First, the conserved G GUU UUU shift site is located 13--14 nucleotides upstream of the stimulatory stem-loop, seemingly too far away to position the shift site in the decoding centre during a pause. Secondly, the viral 2A protein is required as a trans-activator of frameshifting in cells and in vitro (11, (22) (23) (24) which permits temporally controlled, variable-efficiency frameshifting related to the amount of 2A protein in the cell during infection. To date, cardioviruses present one of only two known examples of protein-stimulated frameshifting, along with porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and other arteriviruses (family Arteriviridae), where a complex of viral nsp1\u2424 and host poly(C) binding protein stimulates PRF (25) (26) (27) .",

            "text": "Our previous investigations of protein-stimulated frameshifting in EMCV and TMEV have revealed that the viral 2A protein acts in complex with a stem-loop downstream of the slippery sequence, and that this interaction can be disabled by mutating either a conserved cytosine triplet in the loop or a pair of conserved arginine residues in the protein (11, 22, 23) . More recently, we solved the structure of EMCV 2A, revealing a novel protein fold that permits binding to both the stem-loop and to ribosomal RNA with high affinity (28) . However, 2A protein sequences are highly divergent within cardioviruses, and the TMEV protein shares only \u223c27% pairwise amino acid sequence identity with its EMCV orthologue. Additionally, the stem-loop that comprises the stimulatory element in TMEV is significantly more compact than the equivalent structure in EMCV. Here we present the X-ray crystal structure of TMEV 2A and investigate the interaction with its cognate RNA using a variety of biochemical and biophysical techniques. We define a minimal TMEV stimulatory element necessary for 2A binding and show that the protein forms a 1:1 RNA-protein complex with nanomolar affinity. We provide evidence that the alternative pseudoknot-like conformation recently described for the EMCV stimulatory element (28) is also likely to be present in TMEV and other cardioviruses. Finally, we use metabolic labelling and ribosome profiling to study 2A-stimulated frameshifting and translation of the TMEV genome at sub-codon resolution in infected cells. Together, this body of work defines the molecular basis of Theilovirus protein-stimulated frameshifting, one of the most efficient frameshifting events known in nature.",

Recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) pLysS cells. Cultures were grown in 2\u00d7 TY broth supplemented with 100 g/ml ampicillin (37 \u2022 C, 210 rpm). Expression was induced at A 600 of \u223c1 with 1.0 mM isopropyl \u2424-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and continued overnight (210 rpm, 21 \u2022 C, 16 h). Bacteria were pelleted (4000 \u00d7 g, 4 \u2022 C, 20 min), washed in cold PBS and stored at -20 \u2022 C. Cells from four litres of culture were thawed in 200 mL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris (HCl) pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 5.0 mM DTT, 0.05% w/v Tween-20 supplemented with 50 g/ml DNase I and EDTA-free protease inhibitors) and lysed using a cell disruptor (24 kPSI, 4 \u2022 C). The insoluble fraction was pelleted by centrifugation (39 000 \u00d7 g, 40 min, 4 \u2022 C) and discarded. Supernatant was incubated (2 h, 4 \u2022 C) with 4.0 ml of Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (GE Healthcare) that had been pre-equilibrated in the same buffer. Protein-bound resin was washed three times by centrifugation (600 \u00d7 g, 10 min, 4 \u2022 C) and re-suspension in 150 mL wash buffer (50 mM Tris (HCl) pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 5.0 mM DTT).

GST-tagged 3C protease was added to the eluate (10 g/ml, prepared in-house) and the mixture was dialysed (3K molecular weight cut-off (MWCO), 4 \u2022 C, 16 h) against 2 l wash buffer to remove the glutathione. Dialysed proteins were then re-incubated with Glutathione Sepharose 4B resin (as above; 2 h, 4 \u2022 C) to remove the cleaved GST and GST-3C protease. The flow-through was subjected to heparin-affinity chromatography to remove nucleic acids. Samples were loaded on a 10 ml HiTrap Heparin column (GE Healthcare) at 2.0 ml/min, washed with two column volumes of buffer A (50 mM Tris (HCl) pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 1.0 mM DTT and eluted with a 0% \u2192 100% gradient of buffer B (50 mM Tris (HCl) pH 8.0, 1.0 M NaCl, 1.0 mM DTT) over 20 column volumes.

The static light scattering, differential refractive index, and the UV absorbance at 280 nm were measured by DAWN 8+ (Wyatt Technology), Optilab T-rEX (Wyatt Technology), and Agilent 1260 UV (Agilent Technologies) detectors. The corresponding molar mass from each elution peak was calculated using ASTRA 6 software (Wyatt Technology) using the differential refractive index and a dn/dc value of 0.186 to calculate the protein concentration.

Data were recorded as above, and to estimate the relative contributions of protein and RNA to molar mass, a protein conjugate analysis was performed within ASTRA 6, using a protein dn/dc value of 0.186 and an RNA (modifier) dn/dc value of 0.168. Prior to this analysis, extinction coefficients (at 280 nm) were determined experimentally from proteinonly and RNA-only peaks using the 'UV extinction from RI peak' method in ASTRA 6.",

Data were collected at a wavelength of 0.9159\u00c5 and a temperature of 100 K. Reflections were indexed and integrated with DIALS (30) (highest resolution crystal) or XDS (31) (structure determination crystal) and data were scaled and merged with AIM-LESS (32) within the Xia2 data reduction pipeline (33) . Resolution cut-off was decided by a CC 1/2 value \u22650.5 and an I/(I) \u22652.0 in the highest resolution shell (34) . The structure was solved by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (SAD) analysis of the structure determination crystal, using anomalous signal from bromine present in the crystallisation buffer. SAD phasing was performed using au-toSHARP (35) , implementing SHELXD for substructure determination (36) , SHARP for density modification (35) and ARP/wARP (37) for automated model building. This placed 123 residues out of 133 (92%) in the single chain that comprised the asymmetric unit of the cubic P2 1 3 cell. This preliminary model was subsequently used as a molecular replacement search model to solve a higher resolution dataset (highest resolution crystal) using Phaser (38) . This model was then subjected to several rounds of manual adjustment using COOT (39) and refinement with phenix.refine (40) . Upon completion of model building, ISOLDE (41) was used to improve model geometry and resolve clashes prior to a final round of refinement using phenix.refine. Mol-Probity (42) was used to assess model geometry including Ramachandran outliers, bad rotamers and mainchain geometry deviations throughout the refinement process. For the electrostatic potential calculations, PDB2PQR (43) and PROPKA were used to estimate protein pKa values and assign partial charges. Electrostatic surface potentials were calculated using APBS (44) . Relative solvent-accessible surface areas per residue were calculated using GetArea (45) and crystallographic interaction interfaces were assessed using PDBePISA (46) .

For plots covering the entire virus genome, a sliding window running mean filter of 15 nt was applied. To generate the plot of WT and SS data normalised by M3 data, UTRs plus a small buffer (7 nt at the 5 -end of the CDS and 27 nt at the 3 -end) were excluded and the result of the 15 nt running mean at each position on the WT or SS genome was divided by the 15 nt running mean at the corresponding position on the M3 genome. This avoided any instances of division by zero. Only positive-sense reads were used, and library pairs for normalisation were allocated according to replicate number. For the broad-spectrum dataset, guided by the length distribution and phasing plots, reads of lengths 51-52, 54-55 and 57-64 nt were selected for analysis as potential 'disome-protected fragments', and the denominator for normalisation of disome-protected read densities to RPM was calculated using only reads of these lengths. For all plots of read distribution on the viral genome, a +12 nt offset was added to the 5 -end coordinate of the read before plotting, to reflect the inferred position of the ribosomal P site. For disome-protected fragments, this represents the position of the P site of the colliding ribosome. For plots in the main text showing data from only one replicate, replicate 3 was used.

After cleavage of the GST tag and removal of contaminating nucleic acids by heparin affinity chromatography, high-salt conditions were required to prevent aggregation and maintain solubility. Under optimised conditions, size-exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS) revealed the protein to be predominantly monomeric ( Figure 1B, peak 2) with an observed M w of 16,683 Da compared to a theoretical mass of 15 941 Da, as calculated from the primary sequence. A small proportion of trimers was also present ( Figure 1B , peak 1: observed mass of 46 867 Da versus theoretical mass of 47 823 Da). We crystallised the protein but were unable to solve the structure by molecular replacement using the crystal structure of the closest homologue, EMCV 2A (28) , as a search model. Instead, we obtained experimental phases via bromine derivatisation and determined the structure by single-wavelength anomalous dispersion analysis. The asymmetric unit of the cubic cell contained a single copy of 2A, which was refined to 1.9\u00c5 resolution (Supplementary Table S1, Figure 1C ). Interpretable electron density was visible for 2A residues 1-126, with a short G -4 P -3 L -2 G -1 S 0 Nterminal extension that resulted from 3C protease cleavage of the GST tag. In the crystalline lattice these residues mediate contacts between symmetry-related molecules, consistent with recombinant 2A forming trimers at high concentrations (Supplementary Figure S1) . These residues project away from the globular TMEV domain and lack regular secondary structure, suggesting that they will be flexible at lower concentrations of 2A in solution where monomers predominate ( Figure 1B) . Since tag-derived residues mediate the inter-subunit contacts, the 2A trimerisation interface that we observe in crystallo is unlikely to be physiologically relevant. However, we cannot exclude the possibly that alternate protein-protein interfaces may exist at physiological salt.",

            "text": "The structure of TMEV 2A reveals a globular \u2424 3 \u2423\u2424 3 \u2423 fold, with a similar 'beta-shell' architecture to EMCV 2A (C \u2423 backbone RMSD of 2.65\u00c5 over 130 residues) (28) . An extensive curved antiparallel six-stranded beta sheet packs against two alpha helices on the concave surface of the sheet, whilst the loops between adjacent beta strands project from the opposite convex face. The protein is highly basic (pI \u223c 9.4) and most of the contributing lysine, arginine and histidine residues are solvent-exposed. At physiological pH the protein will thus have a positive electrostatic surface potential across the convex face of the beta sheet, surrounding loops and the N-terminal end of helix \u24231, suggesting a putative RNA-binding surface ( Figure 1C ). This is supported by a previous biochemical analysis of TMEV 2A function, in which we made several point mutations of conserved basic residues and assessed their ability to stimulate PRF (23) ( Figure 1D ). The M3 mutant (R85A/R87A, termed '2Amut' in Napthine et al., 2019) was found to completely inhibit frameshifting, and the M1 mutant (K24A/R28A) was found to reduce it by approximately four-fold. Both M3 and M1 are in surface loops on either side of this large, positively charged beta sheet, consistent with a role for this face of the protein in forming electrostatic interactions with the ribose phosphate backbone of the PRF stimulatory element. In contrast, M2 (R45A) had no effect -indeed most of this residue is buried (only \u223c11.6% of the residue's surface area being solvent-accessible) and it likely plays a structural role in stabilising packing of helix \u24231 against the underside of the central sheet. Perhaps surprisingly, M4 (K90A/K91A) also had no effect, despite these residues being located in the same positively charged loop as the essential R85 and R87. This demonstrates that charge alone is not sufficient to drive RNA binding, and the reliance on arginine may reflect a requirement for a more complex network of bidentate or bifurcated bonding interactions between the side chain guanidinium groups and backbone or base atoms in the RNA.",

            "text": "Despite low sequence identity, the overall fold of TMEV 2A is similar to EMCV 2A ( Figure 1E ). The most functionally important part of EMCV 2A is the 'arginine loop' between strands \u24245 and \u24246 -necessary for PRF (22) , RNA binding (28) and nuclear localisation (58) . The two arginines in this loop (R95/R97 in EMCV 2A; R85/R87 in TMEV 2A) are amongst the only surface-exposed residues that are completely conserved across both species of cardiovirus. (Figure 2A) . Structurally, this loop adopts an almost identical conformation, consistent with mutagenesis data suggesting that they are functionally equivalent (22, 23) . However, there are also some key differences between the two 2A orthologues ( Figure 1E ). The loop region between the end of \u24231 and the start of \u24244 is much longer in EMCV 2A. This loop, and the N-terminal end of \u24231, are two of three regions that contribute to the RNAbinding surface in EMCV 2A (28) . These two regions are not conserved in TMEV 2A ( Figure 2B ): the backbone geometry is different, and, with the exception of K63 and R45, there are no chemically equivalent side chains in the vicinity that could form similar interactions. To investigate this further, we prepared variants of TMEV 2A containing point mutations (R85A/R87A, K63A, K83A and K53A/H56A; Supplementary Figure S2A ) and tested their ability to bind stimulatory element RNA (Supplementary Figure S2B) . Only the R85A/R87A protein showed a significant defect compared to wild-type protein, confirming the unique importance of this conserved arginine loop. Beyond this, the RNA binding surface in TMEV 2A likely differs from EMCV 2A, perhaps involving additional residues on the surface of the beta sheet that are only conserved amongst Theilovirus isolates (e.g. R7, D9, K24, H26; Fig-ure 2C ). This is supported by a reduction in PRF seen with the M1 (K24A) mutant (23) .",

            "text": "The conservation at the C-terminus of the protein ( Figure  2A) is concentrated in the D(V/I)ExNPG motif required for StopGo peptide release between 2A and 2B gene products in other cardioviruses (9, 10) . As expected, this motif is unstructured in both proteins, and if we consider only the ordered amino acids, we observe some of the largest structural differences ( Figure 1E ). In EMCV 2A, the shorter \u24232 helix leads to a more pronounced curvature of the central beta sheet, and the C-terminus forms a short \u24247 strand that packs against \u24243. Conversely, in TMEV 2A, the \u24232 helix continues with a pronounced 90 \u2022 kink until the end of the protein. This has consequences for the structure of the putative YxxxxL motif at the C-terminus that has previously been reported to sequester eIF4E in a manner analogous to 4E-BP, thereby disabling cap-dependent translation of host mRNA (58) . In TMEV 2A, the first tyrosine residue of this motif (Y119) is located on the buried side of the \u24232 helix (with only approximately 4.0% of the residue's surface area being solvent accessible) and is therefore not available to interact with eIF4E. A second tyrosine (Y120) is more exposed (\u223c26.7% of the residue's surface area being solvent accessible), but given the local secondary structure, it is unlikely that L124 and I125 would be able to interact with eIF4E in the same way as 4E-BP without a significant conformational change ( Figure 2D ). In EMCV 2A, the putative YxxxxL motif is not helical, instead forming a more extended backbone (28) . Superposition of this region reveals that this motif is not structurally conserved between 2A orthologues ( Figure 2E ). Therefore, the interaction with eIF4E must either involve other parts of the protein or must be accompanied by significant structural rearrangement of the \u24232 helix of TMEV.",

Shortening the loop by three nucleotides (TMEV 5, K D = 615 \u00b1 89 nM) slightly reduced the affinity, however removal of the 5 extension (TMEV 2, TMEV 4) completely abolished 2A binding, even though the stem-loop in TMEV 4 is predicted to be intact, and the three essential cytosines are present in the loop. To validate that these small RNAs are adopting conformations relevant to PRF, we performed competition experiments. A dual-luciferasebased reporter mRNA containing the TMEV shift site and stimulatory element was prepared and designed such that 0frame and \u22121-frame products would be easily distinguishable by SDS-PAGE following in vitro translation in rabbit reticulocyte lysates (23) . In the presence of 2A, PRF occurred efficiently (\u223c57%; Figure 3E ), but inclusion of a molar excess of the small RNA would be predicted to reduce PRF efficiency if the competitor RNA were to sequester 2A from the reporter mRNA. In line with the EMSA assays, TMEV 3 and TMEV 6 both efficiently competed with the reporter mRNA, reducing PRF to 38% and 21%, respectively. TMEV 1 was able to compete to a lesser extent, reducing PRF to 44%, whilst RNAs lacking the 5 extension (TMEV 2, TMEV 4) were unable to compete ( Figure 3E) .",

            "text": "We have recently shown that the 5 extension is also important for 2A binding in EMCV, where it likely forms the second stem of an RNA pseudoknot via interaction with the CCC loop motif (28) . However, given that the equivalent loop sequence is 11 nt shorter in TMEV, it was unclear whether this alternate conformation would be topologically possible for the more compact RNA element. Nevertheless, an alignment of cardiovirus RNA sequences that direct PRF shows that, in addition to the cytosine triplet, there are several nucleotides in the 5 extension that are completely conserved in all isolates ( Figure 4A, Supplementary Figure  S3 ). To investigate this in more detail, we truncated the 5 extension one nucleotide at a time ( Figure 4B ) and assessed 2A binding by EMSA ( Figure 4C ). Removal of the first six nucleotides of the 5 extension (CAGCCA; TMEV 7-9) had no dramatic effect on 2A binding, however removal of nucleotides from the conserved CAAGG motif progressively reduced binding until it was undetectable (TMEV 12). To explore this further, we made point mutations and assessed their effects in a frameshift reporter assay ( Figure 4D ). As expected, loop mutations C36G or C38G abolished PRF. However, frameshifting in the C38G background was restored by introducing a G17C mutation in the 5 extension, demonstrating the necessity for a base pair between positions 17 and 38. The importance of this alternate conformation for 2A recognition was verified by EMSA analysis ( Figure 4E ). In RNA TMEV 9, which comprises the minimal functional element as defined by the deletion analysis, individual mutation of either C38 or G17 completely abrogated 2A binding. An unrestrained RNA folding simulation (59) identified a pseudoknot-like conformation consistent with the biochemical data, including a base pair between G17 and C38 ( Figure 4F ). This is consistent with our evidence for a pseudoknot-like conformation in the EMCV sequence that is selectively recognised by 2A (28) . Whilst the double C38G + G17C mutant could rescue PRF in our in vitro reporter assay, it did not restore 2A binding by EMSA, either in the background of TMEV 9 ( Figure 4E ) or the longer TMEV 1 RNA (data not shown). It is possible that the double mutant forms a topologically equivalent conformer that is either less stable and/or binds 2A with lower affinity. Thus, whilst this RNA is still able to stimulate PRF, the association does not persist for the necessary timescales to permit observation in a dissociative technique such as EMSA.",

Increasing the salt concentration had only a slight effect on 2A binding as judged by EMSA ( Figure 5A ) and under these conditions we observed a K D of 67 \u00b1 7 nM and a \u223c1:1 molar ratio of protein to RNA (Figure 5B and C) . The large contribution of H (\u221210.7 \u00b1 0.13 kcal/mol) term to the overall free energy of binding (\u22129.8 kcal/mol) is consistent with an interaction mechanism driven by hydrogen bond or electrostatic contact formation. To confirm the stoichiometry in solution, we performed a SEC-MALS analysis of the mixture retrieved from the ITC cell ( Figure 5D ).

Cells were lysed and the presence of 2A verified by western blotting (Supplementary Figure S5A) . Lysates were treated with RNase I and ribosome-protected mRNA fragments (RPFs) were harvested by pelleting the ribosomes through sucrose with subsequent phenol extraction ( Figure  6C ). RPFs were ligated to adapters, cloned, and deep sequenced. Reads were mapped to the host (M. auratus) and viral (based on NC 001366) genomes (Supplementary Table S2) to determine precisely the locations of translating ribosomes. Quality control analysis, carried out as previously described (62) , indicated that the datasets were of high quality (Supplementary Figure S5) . RPFs mapping to coding sequences exhibited the characteristic length distribution with peaks at 20-22 nt and 28-30 nt (Supplementary Figure S5B ), corresponding to the two distinct lengths of mRNA protected from nuclease digestion by the translating ribosome (60, (63) (64) (65) (66) . In mammalian cell lysates treated with sufficient nuclease so that all unprotected regions of mRNA are fully digested ('trimmed'), there is a distance of \u223c12 nt between the 5 end of the RPF and the first nucleotide in the P site of the ribosome (60). This can be used to infer the frame of translation. In our libraries, the majority of CDS-mapping RPF 5 ends map to the first nucleotide position of codons (herein termed phase 0) (Supplementary Figure S5C) , indicating successful nuclease trimming. RPFs map to coding sequences with a triplet periodicity reflective of the length of a codon and, as expected, few RPFs map to the UTRs (Supplementary Figure S5D) .",

There is a clear dominance of the 0 phase throughout the genome ( Figure 6E ), including within the + 1-frame L* ORF which overlaps L and VP0, indicating that the L* ORF is not highly translated. Ribosomes that undergo frameshifting at the 2B* shift site translate only eight codons in the \u22121 frame before encountering a termination codon. This results in a striking drop-off in ribosome density on the WT genome ( Figure 6D ). No such decrease in density is seen after the frameshift site on the SS virus genome, and there is actually a slight increase in read density in this region on the M3 genome. This could be due to differences between the two regions in mean translation rate or the extent of various biasing effects inherent in the ribosome profiling procedure, such as ligation, PCR or nuclease biases (67) . In order to control for these effects and highlight translational features related to the presence of a functional 2A and/or shift site, the read densities on the WT and SS genomes were divided by those in the corresponding position on the M3 genome ( Figure 6F, Supplementary  Figure S6B ). Frameshift efficiency was calculated from the Positive sense reads are plotted in green (above the horizontal axis), negative sense in red (below the horizontal axis; negligible amounts). In all plots, RPF densities from replicate 3 are shown, plotted at the inferred position of the ribosomal P site. (E) Positive-sense RPF densities from D, coloured according to phase (purple, blue, and yellow represent RPFs whose 5 ends map to, respectively, the first, second or third nucleotides of polyprotein-frame codons, defined as phases 0, +1/\u22122 and + 2/\u22121), after application of a 15 codon running mean filter. Frames for each viral ORF are designated with respect to the polyprotein (set to 0) and indicated on the genome map by colour and by an offset on the y axis in the corresponding direction. (F) Ratio of WT or SS RPF density at each position on the genome relative to the RPF density on the M3 mutant genome. UTRs were excluded, only positive-sense reads were used, and a 15 nt running mean filter was applied before the division. Regions defined as 'upstream' and 'downstream' in the ribosome profiling frameshift efficiency calculations are annotated below, and average densities for these regions indicated to the left of the plots with grey lines. (G) Inferred positions of ribosomal P sites at the slippery sequence and in the 2B* region, coloured according to the phase of RPF 5 ends as in (E). The genome sequence in this region is underlaid beneath the data in the top panel, and all libraries are set to the same scale on the y axis, with no running mean filter applied. ratio of M3-normalised RPF density in the regions downstream and upstream of the frameshift site, revealing a mean WT frameshift efficiency of 85%, which to our knowledge is the highest \u2212 1 PRF efficiency thus far recorded in any natural system (11, 22, 23) (Figure 6B , green bars). This is significantly greater than the 63% measured by metabolic labelling at the same timepoint (two-tailed Welch's t-test: t = \u221210.2, df = 2.03, P = 0.0090). The profiling assay (with M3 normalisation) is expected to be substantially more accurate than the metabolic labelling approach, which suffers from lower sensitivity (densitometry of a few protein bands versus high throughput sequencing) and lower temporal resolution (1 h labelling versus snap-freezing translating ribosomes).",

It should be noted that in frameshift efficiency calculations, neither the profiling nor the metabolic labelling experiments would reliably distinguish between ribosome drop-off due to termination at the 2B* stop codon post-frameshifting and ribosome drop-off at the StopGo site located just five codons upstream. However, StopGo is generally very efficient in cultured cells, with little drop-off (68, 69) , and this is evident here, as no obvious decrease in RPF density occurs after the StopGo motif in the M3 mutant ( Figure 6D , Supplementary Figure S6A) . Surprisingly, the mean frameshift efficiency of the SS mutant was high, at 15%. Similar residual frameshift activity has been observed at other highly efficient frameshift signals with analogous mutations designed to knock out frameshifting (70, 71) . This may be reflective of the very strong frameshift-stimulatory activity of the 2A-RNA complex facilitating frameshifting even despite unfavourable codon-anticodon repairing in the \u22121 frame. However, prolonged pausing of ribosomes over the mutant slippery sequence (discussed below) could potentially influence mechanisms other than frameshifting that may contribute to this observed drop-off, such as ribosome rescue pathways (72) .",

However, while observed to a small extent on WT shift sites in vitro (23, 70, (73) (74) (75) , it has been elusive in ribosome profiling data (62, 76) . However, if the slippery sequence is mutated to prevent frameshifting, a measurable pause is seen both in vitro (18, 23, 27) and in profiling experiments (22) , perhaps reflecting a reduced ability of nonframeshifting ribosomes to resolve the topological problem posed by the downstream frameshift-stimulatory element. Ribosome profiling can allow the identification of ribosome pauses with single-nucleotide precision, but at the level of individual nucleotides, the profiles can be strongly affected by nuclease, ligation, and potentially other biases introduced during library preparation. However, by comparing the WT and SS genome ribosome profiles with the M3 genome ribosome profile, many of these biases are nor-malised, allowing changes in dwell time to be identified that are likely to arise as a result of 2A binding.",

This pause likely corresponds to ribosomes translating the RNA-binding arginine residues (R85 and R87), which are mutated to alanine in the M3 genome. The pause on the M3-normalised plot likely reflects increased decoding time for the arginineencoding CGC codons in the WT, which are relatively poorly adapted to the cellular tRNA pool compared to the alanine-encoding GCC codons in the M3 mutant (57,77) ( Figure 7B and C) . This peak is present to a lesser extent on the SS genome, potentially due to the slightly slower replication kinetics of this mutant virus (11) meaning there are fewer copies of the viral genome to deplete the cellular supply of the relevant amino-acylated tRNA.",

This putative pause is present to a lesser extent on the WT genome (marked 0 in purple), but not the M3 genome, indicating it is related to the presence of functional 2A. The UUU codon of the slippery sequence also appears to have a much larger phase 0 peak in SS than M3, however this may be enhanced by potential 'run-on' effects in which a fraction of ribosome pauses may be able to resolve during cell harvesting and ribosomes translocate to the next codon (77) . On both WT and SS genomes, a noticeable peak is present two nucleotides downstream of the main slippery sequence pause, corresponding to ribosomes which have frameshifted and then translocated one codon, and further peaks suggestive of \u2212 1-frame translation throughout the 2B* ORF, especially on the WT template. Closer inspection of the wholegenome ( Figure 6D , Supplementary Figure S6A ) and M3normalised plots ( Figure 6F, Supplementary Figure S6B ) reveals that the pause at the frameshift site actually extends a little further upstream, ending just upstream of the 2A-2B junction formed by the StopGo motif. Further investigation of this region ( Figure 7B ) reveals prominent pauses in the SS mutant, and to a lesser extent the WT, with ribosomal P sites corresponding to the glutamic acid and methionine residues of the D(V/I)ExNPG|P StopGo motif (pause sites highlighted in bold, where x is methionine in TMEV). These pauses are larger than the pause over the slippery sequence itself. Ribosomal pausing over StopGo motifs has been observed in vitro (69) but was shown to occur with the ribosomal P site corresponding to the conserved glycine residue directly before the separation site (69, 78) , suggesting that the pauses we see have another origin.",

Disomes are routinely excluded during preparation of ribosome profiling libraries by the inclusion of a size-selection step (in this study, 19-34 nt) which selects for monosomeprotected fragments (60) . For mock, WT-and M3-infected lysates from replicate 3 we carried out two parallel size selection steps, in which the 19--34 nt 'monosome' fraction and a 35-65 nt 'broad spectrum' fraction were isolated from the same lysate. The length distribution of broad spectrum reads demonstrated local peaks at read lengths of around 51, 54 and 59-63 nt, consistent with expected lengths of RNA protected by disomes (64, 79, 80) (Figure 8A ). Reads of lengths 51-52, 54-55 and 57-64 nt showed a bias in phase composition towards phase 0, indicating a portion of genuine ribosome footprints ( Figure 8B ). These read lengths were selected for analysis as potential 'disome-protected Read lengths which were selected for inclusion in the 'disome-protected fragment' plots (C and D) are indicated by square brackets, and correspond to peaks in (A). (C) Density of disome-protected fragments on the WT and M3 viral genomes, derived from the same lysate as the monosome-protected fragment data plotted in Figure 6D -G. Reads of lengths 51-52, 54-55 and 57-64 nt were selected for inclusion, and read densities are plotted as RPM after application of a 15 nt running mean filter. Positive-sense reads are plotted in green (above the horizontal axis), negative sense in red (below the horizontal axis). In all disome plots, reads are plotted at the inferred P site position of the colliding ribosome. (D) Density of disome-protected fragments, plotted at inferred P site positions of colliding ribosomes involved in disomes upstream of the 2B* frameshift site, coloured according to phase as in (B). The encoded amino acid sequence in this region is underlaid beneath the data in the top panel, and both libraries are set to the same scale on the y axis, with no running mean filter applied. Codons on which leading ribosomes would be expected to pause due to StopGo and frameshifting (FS) are indicated in brown and grey respectively.

This is the expected distance between the P sites of ribosomes involved in a disome (79) (80) (81) , and would be consistent with disome formation due to a ribosome translating the StopGo motif colliding with a ribosome paused over the slippery sequence. Further, this approximate ten-codon periodicity in distances between peaks extends upstream, consistent with potential formation of ribosome queues up to six ribosomes long (80,82) ( Figure 8D , grey oblongs). An additional peak is evident over the arginine codon ten codons upstream of the StopGo release site, which would correspond to a disome in which the leading ribosome was paused over the conserved glycine codon of the StopGo motif ( Figure 8D , brown oblongs). This is evidently a feature of the StopGo site itself and unrelated to the binding of 2A downstream, as it occurs in the M3 dataset as well as the WT. It should be noted that ribosome profiling generates an averaged result of ribosome positions over multiple copies of the viral genome, and formation of the two putative disomes proposed here could not occur simultaneously on a single RNA.",

This is particularly apparent in the data from the SS mutant (Figure 6D and F), consistent with the idea that greater pausing over the mutant slippery sequence may be increasing disome formation, pushing the lengths of protected fragments into the disome fraction, and reducing their visibility in the monosome dataset. This is unusual, as no prominent disome peaks were detected near the frameshift site by broad spectrum ribosome profiling of murine coronavirus (62) , nor at the \u22121 PRF site of L-A virus in yeast (83) , although we note that \u22121 PRF is less efficient in both these systems when compared with TMEV. Indeed, the potential formation of disomes at the frameshift site in TMEV represents the first evidence of ribosomes forming queues at a \u2212 1 PRF signal in a eukaryotic system. Disome formation has recently been mechanistically implicated in +1 PRF in yeast and +1 and \u22121 PRF in bacteria (83) (84) (85) (86) . It may be that the impact of ribosomes colliding at the TMEV PRF site contributes to the complex energetic and conformational landscape required to overcome the translation blockade and break the triplet codon periodicity.",

            "text": "Our combination of structural, biophysical, biochemical and deep sequencing approaches affords a view of unparalleled detail into the molecular mechanisms underpinning Theilovirus protein-stimulated frameshifting. Despite highly divergent sequences within cardioviruses, the TMEV 2A protein adopts the second known occurrence of the beta-shell fold. Whilst the distribution of positively charged residues comprising the putative RNA-binding surface is different from that found in EMCV, it nevertheless recapitulates the same exquisite conformational selectivity for binding to its viral RNA target. Strikingly, we demonstrate that this is a pseudoknot that is likely to exist in equilibrium with the stem-loop previously suggested by structure probing experiments. Despite being 11 nt shorter, the stimulatory RNA element is able to adopt a conformation topologically equivalent to that previously seen in EMCV, involving interactions between the loop and the 5 extension. In infected cells, stabilisation of this conformation by high-affinity 2A binding represents the 'switch' that controls frameshifting and thereby reprogramming of viral gene expression. Our ribosome profiling data reveals that, when invoked, this is up to 85% efficient, representing the highest known \u22121 PRF efficiency to date. Whilst frameshift-associated pausing is not normally detectable at WT shift sites in profiling data, we show that it is detectable here by analysing RPFs corresponding to disomes, not only at the PRF site but also the adjacent StopGo motif. This is consistent with the relatively long pauses accompanying TMEV frameshifting in vitro, and suggests that ribosome collisions are more common than previously thought during translation of the TMEV genome. Taken together, these results suggest that there is a fine balance between necessary ribosome pausing associated with recoding events, and the detrimental effect on viral fitness that may result from these pauses lasting long enough to trigger ribosome quality control pathways, and the degradation of the viral RNA. In future, structural characterisation of the 2A-RNA complex will yield further insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the potency of this elongation blockade.",
