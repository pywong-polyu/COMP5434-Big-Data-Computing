            "text": "The development of targeted treatment options for precision medicine is hampered by a slow and costly process of drug screening. While small molecule docking simulations are often applied in conjunction with cheminformatic methods to reduce the number of candidate molecules to be tested experimentally, the current approaches suffer from high false positive rates and are computationally expensive. Here, we present a novel in silico approach for drug discovery and repurposing, dubbed connectivity enhanced Structure Activity Relationship (ceSAR) that improves on current methods by combining docking and virtual screening approaches with pharmacogenomics and transcriptional signature connectivity analysis. ceSAR builds on the landmark LINCS library of transcriptional signatures of over 20,000 drug-like molecules and ~5,000 gene knock-downs (KDs) to connect small molecules and their potential targets. For a set of candidate molecules and specific target gene, candidate molecules are first ranked by chemical similarity to their 'concordant' LINCS analogs that share signature similarity with a knock-down of the target gene. An efficient method for chemical similarity search, optimized for sparse binary fingerprints of chemical moieties, is used to enable fast searches for large libraries of small molecules. A small subset of candidate compounds identified in the first step is then re-scored by combining signature connectivity with docking simulations. On a set of 20 DUD-E benchmark targets with LINCS KDs, the consensus approach reduces significantly false positive rates, improving the median precision 3-fold over docking methods at the extreme library reduction. We conclude that signature connectivity and docking provide complementary signals, offering an avenue to improve the accuracy of virtual screening while reducing run times by multiple orders of magnitude.",

The initial ceSAR search, as defined above, can be subsequently combined with docking simulations to achieve higher specificity for a target at hand. For the purpose of systematic benchmarking and assessment of robustness of the new method, we consider several forms of consensus, starting from the entire library and performing the initial ceSAR search (S) and docking simulations for all compounds in the library to derive the consensus ranking, referred to as C 100 , or starting from a subset of the library, first reduced using the signature connectivity based filter S. When the library is first reduced to the top 5% or 1% of the library, the consensus form of ceSAR is referred to as C 5 and C 1 , respectively. We would like to emphasize that given the negligible computational cost compared with docking (see Figure 7 ) and the low barrier to applying ceSAR, one might consider a success even modest levels of enrichment or increased precision as the library is reduced. The other measure of success is the level of improvement over the baseline that measures the signal due to signature connectivity. As can be seen from Figure 2 , the simple form of ceSAR (S) in fact performs significantly better than the baseline (p-value of 6.1 \u00d7 10 \u221210 using Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), while the consensus form of ceSAR significantly outperform both A and S (including C 1 that yields Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-values of 2.8 \u00d7 10 \u22123 and 1.1 \u00d7 10 \u22128 in comparison with A and S, respectively).

However, docking struggles to correctly rank true positives and the remaining (more challenging) true negatives, resulting in a drop of accuracy as the size of the library is reduced further. Note that DUD-E datasets comprise tens of thousands of molecules, so reduction to less than 1% of the library size is desirable to reduce the number of compounds for testing. In terms of the distribution of precision values over 20 DUD-E targets, the results of the consensus-based ceSAR method (C 1 ) and docking (A) are becoming statistically indistinguishable at 0.5% library size, while providing significant speed-ups since only a small fraction (1%) of the library needs to be re-scored using consensus with docking (see Figure 7) . On the other hand, the simple ceSAR search (S) that can be performed on a personal laptop within minutes, achieves results statistically indistinguishable from docking at 0.1% library size, with both methods yielding a median precision (or positive predictive value) of about 10% at this furthest library reduction (see also Figure 2 ). Note that 0.1% library size on average corresponds to only about 20 compounds to be tested. At this furthest library reduction, the fraction of true binders among the candidate compounds selected by using the C 1 consensus ceSAR approach, which combines signature connectivity analysis with docking for the top 1% of the library ranked by S, is equal or greater than 35% for half of DUD-E targets. We conclude that C 1 consensus method provides the best trade-off between speed and accuracy on the DUD-E benchmark, while the performance of the consensus-based ceSAR methods (C 1 , C 5 and C 100 ) is robust with respect to the choice of the top library subset for integration with docking. This is further illustrated by the distribution of top true positive rank for individual DUD-E targets (see Figure 3 ) that shows good performance of consensus methods. Similar results are obtained on a subset of DUD-E targets (as well as on the original DUD benchmark) using MTiOpenScreen docking server (see Supplementary Materials) .",

As can be also seen from Figure 6 , at the most extreme library reduction considered here (0.1% library size), AutoDock fails to retain any true positives and thus yields precision of 0% in 8 out of 20 cases, compared with 7 for the simple ceSAR search, and only 4 such failures for the C 1 consensus method.

The adage that structure dictates function has been applied in relation to small molecule inhibitors to enhance virtual screening by searching similar compounds and exploring structure activity relationships (SAR) 17, 18, 34, 35 . In this contribution, we introduce an efficient in silico method to accelerate drug discovery and repurposing, dubbed connectivity enhanced Structure Activity Relationship (ceSAR). ceSAR improves on existing approaches by combining small molecule docking simulations with signature connectivity analysis to reduce both false positive rates and the computational cost of virtual screening, and thus allows one to overcome two major limitations of current virtual screening approaches.",

            "text": "The central advantage of LINCS is that it made available for the first time a large library of both chemical (small molecule) perturbation signatures as well as genetic (KD) perturbation signatures in one or multiple biological contexts (cell lines).Furthermore, ceSAR integrates chemical similarity and signature connectivity analyses to increase the overall success rates and expand virtual screening and SAR analysis to other suitable libraries of compounds, including those identified in high throughput experimental screening.Toward that end, an algorithm for fast (exact) chemical similarity search and database retrieval is introduced that optimally exploits the sparse representation of chemical moieties as binary fingerprints. Docking and docking-based in silico screening, on the other hand, rely on shape complementarity between putative inhibitors and target proteins, requiring structural information about the proposed target and its relevant conformational states which may be unavailable39,40 . The results of docking simulations may also be very sensitive to the choice of a target's conformation, choice of the empirical force fields, docking programs and sampling depth 4,12,15 . Additionally, traditional virtual screening approaches are computationally expensive and require significant computing resources. For example, the average CPU time per DUD-E target required to perform AutoDock benchmarking (with the search depth and grid sizes defined in the Online Methods) was of the order of 3,000 CPU hours on a computational cluster consisting mostly of 16 Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2667 v3 @ 3.20 GHz core nodes. For comparison, the average CPU time per target required for the simple ceSAR search (S) was about 3.7 CPU minutes on a laptop computer withtwo Intel i5-4200U @ 1.6 GHz cores, and thus was reduced by roughly 50 thousand-fold compared to docking (seeFigure 7). This dramatic speed increase makes it possible to perform in silico enrichment on large chemical libraries using a personal computer within minutes compared to weeks on a computing cluster, democratizing further the search for new drugs.Despite its negligible computational cost, the simple ceSAR search (S) outperforms docking for 9 out of 20 DUD-E targets and achieves the same median precision of about 10% at extreme library reductions. The C 1 consensus based method yields higher precision and enrichment into true binders compared to docking alone in 12 out of 20, and performs on par with docking on 3 other DUD-E targets, while still greatly reducing the overall computational cost compared to docking alone. In addition, C 1 performs better or on par with docking for several targets (AHCY,",

Namely, in addition to target gene knock-down signatures, ceSAR requires a representative set of transcriptionally profiled molecules broadly covering the drug-like universe. While this is largely true about the LINCS library of over 40,000 compounds (of which some 25,000 have been profiled to date), not all classes of drugs are well represented, or may not induce sufficiently strong signatures to be considered for the connectivity analysis.

Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC)-based concordance measure, ( , ) = ( , ), is used here 23 , and the threshold for significant concordance is set to 0 = 0.2.

Here, we use the 1024-bit atom-pair fingerprint representation 41,45 , as generated by the ChemmineR package 46,47 , which leads to a sparse binary vector representation of LINCS compounds. Indeed, as shown in Supplemental very few of the fingerprint features have a relatively balanced split between ones and zeros across the LINCS compounds.

While more complex, machine learning-based models to combine signature connectivity related features and docking scores are benchmarked in Supplementary Materials, here we present the results of a simple consensus that aims to minimize the risk of overfitting, and defines the combined rank as the geometric average of signature connectivity and docking based ranks.Benchmarking of ceSAR. The Directory of Useful Decoys Enhanced (DUD-E) benchmark was developed to determine the success rate of virtual screening methods and assess their ability to discriminate between the known binders and carefully design sets of decoys that are unlikely to bind to target proteins. To evaluate the performance of ceSAR, we used a subset of 20 targets from the original DUD-E benchmark22 that had gene knockdowns available within LINCS. More details regarding the benchmark datasets used here are provided in the Supplementary Materials. The simple signature connectivity-based ceSAR search, referred to as S for signature-based (or Sig2Lead) , is compared with the traditional virtual screening using AutoDock v. 4.2 docking program and the set of original DUD-E crystal structures for target proteins, referred to as A for Autodock, and with the combined approach, denoted as C for consensus-based, that uses the simple search (S) first to reduce the library, and then applies docking (A) to such reduced subset to derive the consensus ranking as defined in the previous section. In addition, a simple baseline (denoted B) that ignores signature concordance while identifying the closest LINCS analogs of DUD-E compounds, and thus simply reflects biases in coverage for inhibitors of different targets in LINCS, is included to assess the contribution of signature concordance. The results are summarized in Figures 2, 4 and 5 in terms of precision curves to quantify the enrichment into true binders upon the reduction of the DUD-E datasets to small subsets amenable to further validation. Note that the precision, or positive predictive value, the number of false positive predictions, captures how many candidate compounds, selected by in silico ranking, are in fact true binders. Thus, the precision or measures the likelihood of successfully identifying an inhibitor through experimental validation for a small subset of the library reduced here by using ceSAR or docking, which arguably is the most relevant measure of success for virtual screening methods.",
