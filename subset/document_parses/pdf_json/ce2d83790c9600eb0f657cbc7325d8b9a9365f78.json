            "text": "Background/objectives Obesity appears to be an independent risk factor for ICU admission and a severe disease course in COVID-19 patients. An aberrant inflammatory response and impaired respiratory function have been suggested as underlying mechanisms. We investigated whether obesity is associated with differences in inflammatory, respiratory, and clinical outcome parameters in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Subjects/methods Sixty-seven COVID-19 ICU patients were divided into obese (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m 2 , n = 18, 72% class I obesity, 28% class II obesity) and non-obese (BMI < 30 kg/m 2 , n = 49) groups. Concentrations of circulating interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interferon gamma (IFN-\u03b3), interferon gamma-induced protein (IP)-10, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1, and IL-1 receptor antagonist (RA) were determined from ICU admission until 10 days afterward, and routine laboratory and clinical parameters were collected. Results BMI was 32.6 [31.2-34.5] and 26.0 [24.4-27.7] kg/m 2 in the obese and non-obese group, respectively. Apart from temperature, which was significantly lower in obese patients (38.1 [36.9-38.9] vs. 38.7 [38.0 \u221239.5]\u00b0C, p = 0.02), there were no between-group differences on ICU admission. Plasma cytokine concentrations declined over time (p < 0.05 for all), but no differences between obese and non-obese patients were observed. Also, BMI did not correlate with the cytokine response (IL-6 r = 0.09, p = 0.61, TNF-\u03b1 r = 0.03, p = 0.99, IP-10 r = 0.28, p = 0.11). The kinetics of clinical inflammatory parameters and respiratory mechanics were also similar in both groups. Finally, no differences in time on ventilator, ICU length of stay or 40-day mortality between obese and non-obese patients were apparent. Conclusions In COVID-19 patients requiring mechanical ventilation in the ICU, a higher BMI is not related to a different immunological response, unfavorable respiratory mechanics, or impaired outcome.",

For instance, in obese patients, pulmonary function may be restricted because of decreased functional residual capacity, resulting in lower blood oxygen levels [9] . In addition, the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 receptor, which is utilized by SARS-CoV-2 to enter cells, is highly expressed by adipocytes and expression levels were shown to be higher in adipocytes of patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes [10] . Therefore, it appears plausible that adipose tissue may serve as a reservoir for the virus, leading to more pronounced and sustained viral shedding, resulting in a perpetual inflammatory response and impaired outcome.",

In the present study, we investigated associations between obesity and the immune response as well as the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in critically ill patients on the ICU of a tertiary university hospital.

Patients were actively cooled when they had a fever of >40\u00b0C. In these cases, body temperature was imputed as 40\u00b0C. Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP), tidal volume per kilograms ideal body weight (TV IBW ) and PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio were used to assess the level of respiratory support required. Tidal volume was only recorded in patients on volume-controlled mechanical ventilation. Because the vast majority of patients were switched to pressure support ventilation after 4 days of ICU admission, TV IBW data were analyzed until this timepoint.

            "text": "In this observational study in critically ill COVID-19 patients, we observed that, while disease severity and other baseline covariates were similar, temperature at ICU admission was lower in obese compared to non-obese patients. This observation may suggest that the endogenous immune-hypothalamus axis responsible for the induction of fever (IL-1-IL-6-PGE2 pathway) is less pronounced in obese compared to non-obese patients. However, no significant differences in plasma concentrations of various inflammatory markers and cytokines (most importantly IL-6) were observed between both groups. To gain sensitivity to detect a possible relationship between BMI and the cytokine response we performed correlation analyses that confirmed lack of such a relationship. Also, no significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation, ICU length of stay, or mortality was observed between the obese and non-obese group. Taken together, these data indicate that once a COVID-19 patient becomes critically ill, the immune response and clinical course of the disease is not relevantly influenced by the patients' BMI. Obesity has been identified as a risk factor for severe disease and ICU admission in COVID-19 patients admitted to non-intensive care hospital wards [16, 17] . This is not necessarily in contrast with our findings, as obese individuals may be more susceptible to infection, might have a different immune response prior to becoming critically ill, and/or may require more respiratory support [6] . Although several studies have assessed associations between BMI and clinical outcomes/mortality in critically ill COVID-19 patients, conflicting findings have been reported [11] [12] [13] . As such, the relationship between obesity and mortality in these critically ill patients remains unclear. What our study adds pertaining to the role of BMI in critically ill COVID-19 patients are data of inflammatory/immunological markers. Of interest, a paradoxical relationship between obesity and mortality has been described in the general ICU population, as well as in critically ill patients suffering from different infectious diseases, such as pneumonia and bacterial sepsis [18, 19] . Overall, obese patients demonstrate a better survival compared to non-obese individuals, even when corrected for several covariates. This phenomenon has been coined the obesity paradox [20] . Our study was underpowered to demonstrate statistically significant differences in mortality between obese and non-obese patients, and therefore we are unable to confirm or reject the presence of the obesity paradox in COVID-19 patients. The present study has several limitations. First, because of the observational nature of the study, no direct link between cause and effect can be deduced. Second, because of the relatively small group of (especially obese) patients, a type 2 error is possible, and our findings should be regarded as indicative, not conclusive. Nevertheless, there were also no nonsignificant trends in inflammatory parameters or correlations between BMI and any of the circulating cytokines, which would be expected in case BMI would play an crucial role in the immune response in critically ill COVID-19 patients. Third, the present study was conducted in a single center in the Netherlands, where (morbid) obesity 4 Clinical outcome data. a Time on mechanical ventilation, b ICU length-of-stay, c ICU mortality. p values depicted in the panels were calculated using log-rank tests. Dotted lines indicate 95% confidence intervals. may be less widespread compared to other countries. Accordingly, the obese group consisted largely of mildly obese patients and no patients with a BMI above 40 kg/m 2 were present in our cohort. Fourth, because patients in our cohort were all included after ICU admission and received mechanical ventilation, no statements can be made about the relationship between obesity and the risk of ICU admission or requirement of mechanical ventilation. Finally, we focused on innate immunity, so possible differences between obese and non-obese COVID-19 patients in adaptive immune response remain to be explored.",
