Situated in the global outbreak of COVID-19, our research aims at detecting semantic shifts in social media language triggered by the health crisis. With COVID-19 related big data extracted from Twitter, we train separate word embedding models for different time periods after the outbreak. We employ an alignmentbased approach to compare these embeddings with a general-purpose Twitter embedding unrelated to COVID-19. We also compare our trained embeddings among them to observe diachronic evolution. Carrying out case studies on a set of words chosen by topic detection, we verify that our alignment approach is valid. Finally, we quantify the size of global semantic shift by a stability measure based on back-andforth rotational alignment.",

We compare these embedding spaces with a generalpurpose Twitter word embedding model generated from tweets collected before the pandemic. We also compare the three COVID-19 related embedding spaces among themselves to detect semantic shift of vectors over time. To ensure that the comparisons are reasonable, we need to align the vectors between different latent spaces. Inspired by Zhang et al. (2016) and Hamilton et al.

Recently, many researchers have been applying them in the detection of semantic shifts. Most of the proposed approaches are separated into two steps: first generate separate word embeddings for each context and time period independently, then use mathematical approaches to align the different word embeddings. The quality of the alignment is critical to the results of comparisons. Kulkarni et al. (2015) computed the optimal linear transformation between the base and target embedding space by solving a least squares problem of k-nearest neighbors. Hamilton et al. (2016) also employed linear transformations for alignment but only considered orthogonal ones. Zhang et al. (2016) achieved alignment through a similar way, adding the usage of anchor words, whose meanings are supposed to remain stable between the two embedding spaces. The choice of anchor words requires prior expert knowledge. In more recent efforts, (Kim et al., 2014) avoided solving a separate alignment problem by learning the word embeddings jointly.",

We see that the distribution is skewed, centered around 0 and tilted towards the right. Figure 9 shows the stability distribution of words during the months April, May and June. For every word, we compute separately its stability between April-May and May-June, taking the average value as its final stability measure. We see that the distribution is almost normal, centered around 0.4 and not tilted. The absolute value of the stability measure does not make sense, considering that the alignment cannot reach perfection even after optimization. Nonetheless, the shapes of the distributions indicate that there exists both cross-corpora and diachronic semantic shifts. Otherwise, the distributions should be extremely left-skewed and concentrated around a relatively high value.

Figure 10 plots the correlation between a word's stability and its number of occurrence in the pre-COVID-19 general-purpose Twitter dataset. It proves that \"the law of conformity\" holds in our case. This may be explained as the result of our choice of anchor words : we use highly frequent words as static points for the computation of mappings. However, we only use the top 1000 frequent words while \"the law of conformity\" is valid for far more than 1000 data points, as shown in Figure 10 . Figure 11 plots the correlation between a word's stability and its number of occurrence in the COVID-19 related Twitter dataset. Contrary to \"the law of conformity\", stability is negatively correlated with word frequency here. This reveals a new law of semantic change which is natural to our instincts: words occurring more frequently in the event-specific dataset are more likely to shift meanings. ",

On top of that, we introduced a new law of semantic change : words occurring more frequently in the event-specific dataset are more likely to shift meanings.
