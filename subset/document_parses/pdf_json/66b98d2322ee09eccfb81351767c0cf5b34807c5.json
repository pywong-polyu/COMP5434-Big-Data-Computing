In this estimation, the sensitivity and specificity can either be fixed, or belief distributions of their values can be elicited to allow for uncertainty. We analyse data from two published serological studies of dengue, one in Colombo, Sri Lanka, with a single survey and one in Medellin, Colombia, with repeated surveys in the same individuals. For the Colombo study, we illustrate how the inferred force of infection increases as the sensitivity decreases, and the reverse for specificity. When 100% sensitivity and specificity are assumed, the results are very similar to those from a standard analysis with binomial regression. For the Medellin study, the elicited distribution for sensitivity had a lower mean and higher variance than the one for specificity. Consequently, taking uncertainty in sensitivity into account resulted in a wide credible interval for the force of infection.",

It can be used to quantify the impact of disease control programs, and prioritize and identify geographical regions requiring further measures, such as vaccine implementation [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . For infections inducing a lasting immune response, the force of infection is usually estimated via serological surveys ('serosurveys') of immunological status. Ideally, assays used in such surveys should be highly sensitive and specific, while also suitable for high throughput in terms of cost and personnel requirements [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] . In practice, however, available assays may not completely meet all these criteria, as is currently evident with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus responsible for coronavirus disease (COVID-19) [12] . The greater the imperfections in sensitivity and specificity, the less accurate will be the corresponding estimates of the force of infection, as long as such imperfections are not taken into account.",

In the former case, the simplest analysis is to assume that the force of infection was constant over calendar time and age, and consider each person's age to be their duration of exposure [13] . More sophisticated models allow for changing force of infection over time, or over age, or even allow for the presence of maternal antibodies if infants are included [4, 14] . Carrying out more than one survey in the same individuals provides more robust estimates of the force of infection during a given study period [4, 7] . Using repeated surveys, rate ratios can be obtained from binomial regression with complementary log-log link and the logarithm of the time between surveys as an offset [13] . While age is used as the time at risk in the analysis of a single survey, in repeated surveys it can be considered a risk factor like any other. However, whatever the number of surveys, errors in test status are usually ignored, whether analysing one or more surveys. In particular, for repeated surveys, individuals testing positive at baseline are usually considered no longer at risk [1, 4, 7] , ignoring the possibility that they were false positives.",

Various methods have taken into account certain kinds of test imperfection, for either single or repeated surveys. In particular, Trotter & Gay [16] developed a compartmental model of multiple surveys, in which the force of infection and imperfect sensitivity were estimated for Neisseria meningitidis. For a single survey, Alleman et al. [17] and Hachiya et al. [18] estimated the force of infection, and simultaneously test sensitivity for rubella and measles, by assuming that imperfect sensitivity was the reason for seroprevalence not necessarily reaching 100% at the highest ages. Tan et al. [19] used a model for dengue, in which sensitivity reduces over time as antibody levels decrease, applied to two independent population serosurveys from blood donors. Olive et al. [20] estimated the force of infection for Rift Valley fever based on fixed values of sensitivity and specificity for a single survey.",

Example data from a single serosurvey of dengue are from Colombo, Sri Lanka, which used a capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) [14, 25] .

Another way to quantify uncertainty is in terms of expert opinion, e.g. via the Delphi technique [28] . Here we follow the elicitation method of Johnson et al. [29] . For each parameter, each expert is presented with a range of values. For the current purpose, the parameters are sensitivity and specificity, each with a range of 0 to 100%, in intervals (\"bins\") of 5%. Each expert is invited to i) make a point or \"average\" estimate of the parameter in question, then ii) indicate the upper and lower limit of their estimate, then iii) indicate their weight of belief by allocating a total of 100% over the bins, between the upper and lower limits, in units of 5%. So we have a total of six questions: three each for sensitivity and specificity. Johnson et al., used paper questionnaires and stickers for the units of 5% weight of belief. We adapted this to a spreadsheet in Microsoft Excel (S1 File). This approach could also be applied to the analysis of a single survey.",

Not all assays are suitable for serological surveys. For example, the World Health Organization discourages the use of rapid tests in such studies of dengue [5] , and the utility of serological assays for SARS-CoV-2 is currently being debated [12, 40] . Statistical methods can help quantify the degree of uncertainty that would arise from the use of any given test. Previous studies have simultaneously estimated test sensitivity and force of infection for single or repeated surveys [16] [17] [18] , and estimated the force of infection subject to fixed values for sensitivity and specificity in a single survey [20] . Here we present more general methods for estimating the force of infection taking into account imperfect sensitivity and/or specificity, and uncertainty in these parameters, for either single or repeated surveys. Should well-established and generalizable values of sensitivity and specificity be available, they can be used in the methods described here. However, this is not always the case. For example, for dengue, there may be cross-reaction with other flaviviruses [30] , whose occurrence varies geographically.",

When perfect sensitivity and specificity are assumed, the results are effectively identical to those from the standard binomial regression. For the example of repeated serosurveys in Medellin [25] , the elicited expert belief for the specificity was relatively precise, resulting in a fairly precise estimate of the force of infection (95% credible interval 3.7 to 6.2% per year). The belief for sensitivity was less precise and resulted in an interval estimate that was so wide (5.5 to 43.1%) as to potentially lack utility. The results from these two studies illustrate the method, but the force of infection values should not be taken as authoritative for the study settings.",

The model for a single serosurvey is similar to that of Lewis et al. for prevalence [21] , and may be soluble by direct application of maximum likelihood, hence avoiding the need for iterative sampling. The identifiability of some Bayesian models for the estimation of prevalence is affected by the choice of priors for sensitivity, specificity and other parameters: unsuitable priors can then give rise to erroneous conclusions [34] . Although it may be possible to 'learn' about both a) sensitivity and specificity and b) the force of infection, here we have avoided identifiability concerns via Monte Carlo simulation of uncertainty in sensitivity and specificity. In effect, the elicited distribution is both the prior and posterior distribution. This approach was shown for the model for repeated surveys but could equally be applied to the one for a single survey. It was illustrated by eliciting beliefs about sensitivity and specificity from three experts: to reach substantive conclusions on dengue, a wider and more systematic exercise would be required [29] . Estimates from systematic reviews could be used instead of expert opinion if they were generalizable to a given study area.",

In the meantime, the use of Monte Carlo in an outer loop, with MCMC estimation each time, makes the analysis relatively time-consuming. Also, a reformulation would be required to allow the inclusion of covariates. The method is shown for two surveys, studies with more than two could be included, with each being constrained to have a seroprevalence no lower than the previous. Another limitation is the assumption that each individual has long-lasting immunity, so that apparent seroreversions are due to test errors rather than waning immunity. The validity of this assumption will depend on the infection in question, and possibly factors such as the time between surveys, and the age and immunocompetence of the participants.",
