To make an object of interest stand out independently from a number of distractors, the underlying visual cue, e.g., color, has to be preattentive. In our prior work, we introduced Deadeye as an instantly recognizable highlighting technique that works by rendering the target object for one eye only. In contrast to prior approaches, Deadeye excels by not modifying any visual properties of the target. However, in the case of 2D visualizations, the method requires an additional setup to allow dichoptic presentation, which is a considerable drawback. As a follow-up to requests from the community, this paper explores Deadeye as a highlighting technique for 3D visualizations, because such stereoscopic scenarios support dichoptic presentation out of the box. Deadeye suppresses binocular disparities for the target object, so we cannot assume the applicability of our technique as a given fact. With this motivation, the paper presents quantitative evaluations of Deadeye in VR, including configurations with multiple heterogeneous distractors as an important robustness challenge. After confirming the preserved preattentiveness (all average accuracies above 90 %) under such real-world conditions, we explore VR volume rendering as an example application scenario for Deadeye. We depict a possible workflow for integrating our technique, conduct an exploratory survey to demonstrate benefits and limitations, and finally provide related design implications.",

Deadeye attracts and guides attention by rendering the target object for one eye only, which works preattentively due to the induced binocular rivalry. One particular benefit to visualizations is that Deadeye does not modify any visual properties of the target object in contrast to other preattentive cues that have to alter the target by recoloring, reshaping, or displacing (3D depth cue). Clearly, such alterations are undesirable, as they might lead to data misinterpretation. Also, by using Deadeye, we do not have to reserve visual dimensions, such as color for highlighting, and can use these variables for, e.g., encoding more data dimensions. Our studies also confirmed that the display of inconsistent stimuli for each eye does not lead to headache or any other physical strain, which is an important consideration for real-world applicability.",

In contrast to more established preattentive cues such as color or flickering, it is rather difficult to predict the behavior of Deadeye in such a setup due to its monocular nature. By removing the object for one eye, we lose the binocular disparity information for the target, which is a crucial part of depth estimation. However, the disparity-based mechanism is not the single point of failure, as our vision system relies on numerous mechanics, such as occlusion geometry [75] , to estimate the depth of an object, which suggests a successful application of Deadeye in VR scenarios.",

Nevertheless, these advantages cannot prevent us from possibly getting lost in the amount of visualized data, and, thus, we continue to need robust and intuitive highlighting techniques. And while certain preattentive cues, such as color, are not affected by the transition to VR, temporal approaches, such as flickering, often interfere with aliasing caused by constant micromovements in VR. Hence, we postulate that establishing Deadeye as a validated highlighting approach in VR without occupying any additional visual dimension offers significant benefits for the visualization community, as outlined in Figure 2 .",

Similarly, we can utilize Deadeye to highlight particles or pathlines in flow field visualizations [56] , as our method is not limited to a single target.

A detailed discussion of that so-called conjunction search is outside the scope of this paper, yet it is important to know about this limitation of preattentive cues when designing complex visualizations. This rule has a few exceptions, i.e., conjunction search setups where parallel processing can be achieved. Prominent examples are the works by M\u00fcller and Muhlenen [52] (form and motion) and Nakayama Silverman [54] (3D depth and color/motion). That latter report was the main motivation for studying conjunction search abilities of Deadeye, since 3D depth and Deadeye both rely on binocular disparities. However, the experiments did not support the hypothesis that Deadeye is suitable for parallel processing when combined with color. Hence, we are not further examining conjunction search in our VR setup, as we do not see any evidence for a change in behavior in this regard.",

Such luminance variations and luminance disparities in general were subjects of further extensive research [4, 13, 18, 70] . Zou et al. [88] reported that although dichoptic presentation can be preattentive, it is usually too weak and overridden by more pronounced features such as orientation.

Clearly, only valid cases appear in nature. As shown by Shimojo and Nakayama [66] , such valid regions are not subject to binocular rivalry and usually appear as part of more distant surfaces, whereas invalid regions appear more ambiguous in depth estimation. In the case of Deadeye, the exposed image pair falls into the invalid category. Hence, at first glance, depth estimation for the highlighted object might be error prone. However, more recent research [5, 20, 31] has revealed that da Vinci stereopsis works in a rather stimulus-dependent way, i.e., the quantitative depth computation approach depends on the given occlusion configuration. Tsirlin et al. [75] concluded that occlusion geometry is most likely the main source for depth extraction in such cases. These recent findings allow us to assume that Deadeye-enhanced objects would also perform well regarding depth estimation in VR setups, especially when we consider that such a stereoscopic environment allows us to observe the object in question from multiple perspectives to achieve a more sophisticated depth impression [68] .",

If a cue is preattentive, the high success rate (typically > 80%) is maintained independently from the number of overall objects on the screen.

Note that preattentive cues perform differently under heterogeneous conditions, and understanding such behavior is crucial because visualizations seldom consist of only one type of objects. Since prior research [88] has demonstrated that dichoptic presentation is a rather weak cue that could be easily overridden by stronger features, we regard an evaluation under heterogeneous conditions as an important milestone for establishing Deadeye as a \"working\" cue for real-world visualizations. Hence, our second hypothesis is that Deadeye accuracy remains robust in scenarios where distractors and the targets have heterogeneous visual properties (H2).",

Second, we assumed that thinner objects, i.e., cylinders in the depth2-color-shape set, might perform worse due to the influence of aliasing (\"shimmering\") caused by slight HMD movement. Yet again, analyzing the missed target locations did not reveal any relation between shape and error rate. The only notable connection between the target position and its likeliness to be overlooked is the angular distance from the focus point, i.e., Deadeye performance decreases for objects in the outer columns.

Two participants were particularly intrigued by that behavior, describing it as a kind of willpower-dependent rendering where one could mentally alter the perceived visualization similar to ambiguous image puzzles (P8). Three participants also noticed that one could modify the transparency level of the highlighted object by rotating the head (P9). This phenomenon is caused by the rather limited field of view of the HMD, i.e., when we look at an object from a sufficiently large angle, that area is no more present for the eye that is further away. Hence, binocular rivalry becomes disabled, and we perceive a valid monocular image from the nearer eye that either contains the object or not.",

One could utilize a meaningful color scheme for highlighting different regions and even have gradients and interpolations if needed (P9). Deadeye instead is either active or not, without any possibility of providing an additional meaning or more granular differentiation (P7).

This multistable perception-induced by binocular rivalry-can be regarded as a benefit or drawback depending on the use case. On one hand, such conditional perception allows us to gather additional information without any interaction with the underlying system. In particular, we think of scenarios with very limited interaction possibilities due to, e.g., asepsis requirements. In such cases, having the ability to see or fade out certain elements by simply focusing on the region of interest might be a valuable technique. On the other hand, the focus-dependent approach is mentally more demanding compared to alternatives such as semitransparency or hiding/showing an object via user input. Although the fatigue results of the NASA-TLX questionnaire are quite reasonable, we expect that a longer, active use of the described switching between highlighted target and background might lead to significant exhaustion. As that phenomenon is less related to the highlighting aspect of Deadeye per se, we would rather consider a more fine-grained exploration as possible follow-up research.",

According to our qualitative evaluation, people prefer color over Deadeye in the case of greyscale scenarios. In our opinion, the most important advantage of color is its nonbinary nature, i.e., we can encode additional information into the highlighted target and differentiate between multiple targets by utilizing diverse colors. However, many visualizations are not greyscale, and applying our technique in such cases has clear advantages over other preattentive approaches: Deadeye does not alter any visual properties such as size or shape; performs well in complex, heterogeneous environments; and is straightforward to implement in stereoscopic setups. Compared to temporal approaches such as flickering, Deadeye does not suffer from typical VR-related issues such as aliasing due to constant movements of the HMD. To summarize, even though color is still superior in greyscale use cases, we emphasize the applicability and usefulness of Deadeye in colored scenarios and consider the technique as a viable addition to our visualization toolbox.",

Second, we demonstrated how Deadeye can be integrated into VR visualizations using the example of volume rendering. The outcomes of the exploratory study underpinned the highlighting capabilities of Deadeye and confirmed our ability to estimate depth of objects highlighted in this manner.
