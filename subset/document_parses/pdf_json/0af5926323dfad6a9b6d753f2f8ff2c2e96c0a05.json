Therefore, the operation of the FRT processing chain is addressed, as well as the juridical nature of the facial signature, focusing mainly in the Brazilian data protection framework. FRT has been used in everyday life for several purposes, such as security, digital ranking, targeted marketing and health protection. However, the indiscriminate use of FRT poses high risks to privacy and data protection. In this perspective, to avoid harms such as inaccuracy, normalisation of cyber-surveillance and lack of transparency, safeguards were identified to guarantee individual rights, such as soft law, oversight, international standards and regulatory sandboxes. 1 In this article, we use the sentence \"(semi-)public\" to represent the two types of spaces, one of public nature and other of a private nature. Where it is necessary to distinguish between them, we use the term sensu stricto to identify the former.",

However, we could question what is the great contribution of facial recognition for this purpose: would it not be sufficient to use traditional surveillance cameras, which have a much smaller impact in people's privacy and rely less on the autonomy for making decisions of these systems?

The second step is the reading of the face geometry by the facial recognition software. The main factors include the distance between the eyes and the distance from the forehead to the chin. The result is known as the 'individual signature' [9] . This signature, which is no more than a mathematical formula, is then compared to known faces in a database. Based on the similarity of the model captured and the data found, a match between the image captured by the surveillance camera and a given image in the faces database may be made.
