            "text": "While some stakeholders presume that studying abroad distracts students from efficient pursuit of their programs of study, others regard education abroad as a high impact practice that fosters student engagement and hence college completion. The Consortium for Analysis of Student Success through International Education (CASSIE), compiled semester-by-semester records from 221,981 students across 35 institutions. Of those students, 30,549 had studied abroad. Using nearest-neighbor matching techniques that accounted for a myriad of potentially confounding variables along with matching on institution, the analysis found positive impacts of education abroad on graduation within 4 and 6 years and on cumulative GPA at graduation. A very small increase in credit hours earned emerged, counterbalanced by a small decrease in time-to-degree associated with studying abroad. Overall, the results warrant conclusions that studying abroad does not impede timely graduation. To the contrary, encouraging students to study abroad promotes college completion. These results held similarly for students who had multiple study abroad experiences, and who have studied abroad for varying program lengths.",

It is likely that even after the pandemic abates, there will be heightened caution around education abroad and the potential risk it poses to students, faculty, and institutions. Whether the growth that education abroad was experiencing prior to the pandemic continues (Institute for International Education, 2020) may be linked to whether education abroad contributes to broad institutional goals. Internationalization has become central to college and university missions and is encoded as a strategic initiative at between 50% (Helms et al., 2017) and 70% (Childress, 2009) of likelihood of graduating in four and 6 years, semesters to degree completion, credits earned, and GPA at graduation?",

            "text": "This study is grounded in Tinto's interactionalist theory of student departure and Astin's developmental theory of involvement. While both acknowledge the role of student background and preparation in student success, they direct our attention on the criticality of what students do in college. Though Tinto's and Astin's theories were originally focused on the outcome of student retention, they have been construed to encompass student success more broadly, including degree completion. Tinto's theory asserts that student persistence is a product of successful student academic and social integration into the institution (Tinto, 1975 (Tinto, , 1993 . That integration is partly determined by students' entering characteristics and external commitments but subsequently shaped by experiences at the institution including academic success; interactions with faculty, staff, and other students; and activities outside the classroom. Interactions that support integration lead to student commitment to the institution and completion (Tinto, 2005) . Important to the implications of this study, Tinto placed responsibility on the institution, not just the student, for fostering student integration. Astin (1984) characterized this student interaction and engagement as involvement and proposed it as a precondition for student success. His analysis of the factors shaping student departure led to his postulation that activities which increase student involvement, defined as the amount of energy they devote to the academic experience, contribute to their development and likelihood of success.",

            "text": "The work of Kuh and colleagues provides a bridge to education abroad. Drawing on these and other theoretical underpinnings about the criticality of engagement to student success, as well as empirical evidence based on this theoretical work, Kuh developed the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE). This instrument was designed to measure both student behaviors and perceptions of their engagement in activities and practices linked to student learning and development as a means of colleges assessing the extent to which they are promoting engagement and therefore student success. Beginning in 2013, along with a larger revision and reorganization of the survey's engagement indicators, items were added about participation in high impact practices (NSSE, 2013) . Kuh argues these practices are effective because they require significant time and effort, include meaningful interactions with faculty and other students about substantive matters, increase the likelihood of engagement with people different than oneself, typically involve frequent feedback on performance, provide opportunities to apply learning in varied settings, and can be life changing (Kuh, 2008) . Among the eight high impact practices identified by Kuh, \"diversity/global learning\" including study abroad is the most relevant here. The current study draws from these theoretical perspectives to investigate study abroad as an educational practice that institutions can employ to enhance student engagement, interaction, and involvement, which in turn contribute to students' integration, retention, development, and degree completion.",

            "text": "Enhanced academic engagement is the most frequently proposed mechanism by which studying abroad may lead to student success outcomes such as timely graduation (Rubin et al., 2014) . A related mechanism is academic focusing (Hadis, 2005) . Education abroad experiences often incorporate elements associated with high impact practices, including substantial time investment for students, out-of-class communication with faculty and peers, and exposure to cultural difference (Kuh, 2008) . For example, in typical academic exchange programs, students are immersed in cross-cultural milieux for housing and socializing as well as for classwork, often for months at a time (Engle & Engle, 2003; cf., Goldoni, 2013) . Even a 4-week self-contained traveling program that is not culturally immersive can provide extensive out-of-class contact with instructors, a writing-intensive curriculum, field research conducted in collaboration with fellow students, and structured reflection deliberately aimed at transformational learning (e.g., Bell et al., 2016) . A number of quantitative studies confirmed that student engagement-especially \"deep learning\" investments in researching, writing, and talking about course subject matter-was indeed fostered by studying abroad (Burns et al., 2018; Coker et al., 2018; Gonyea, 2008; Landon et al., 2017; Rourke & Kanuka, 2012) .",

            "text": "Empirically establishing the link between studying abroad and student learning outcomes is complicated by at least three factors (McAllister-Grande & Whatley, 2020) . First, education abroad programs are academically selective by design; they commonly require a minimum GPA for applicants (Adams & Reinig, 2017) . Second, the population of students who choose to study abroad typically enjoys stronger high school and prior college achievement relative to those who do not study abroad (Dai, 2020; Thomas & McMahon, 1998; Xu et al., 2013) . Given findings that students who study abroad have better access to information about studying abroad relative to students who do not study abroad (Salisbury et al., 2009) , it is quite possible that academic advisors play a big role in directing highachieving undergraduates toward studying abroad, while failing to cultivate such expectations for lower-achieving students. Typical are the findings of Hamir (2011) who found that students who studied abroad, those who applied but never actually participated, and those who neither applied nor participated averaged SAT scores of 1245, 1231, and 1214 respectively; their average sophomore year college GPAs were 3.44, 3.35, and 3.12 respectively. A somewhat discordant finding emerges from research on the integrated model of student choice, which found that while certain high school and college academic experiences predicted intention to study abroad, college admissions test scores did not (Salisbury et al., 2011; Salisbury et al., 2009 ; see also Luo & Jamieson-Drake, 2015) . Finally, the most common time for students to study abroad is during their junior year (Institute for International Education, 2018) . This means that the population of students who study abroad contains a disproportionately large number of students who have been retained from first year to second and from second year to third. The subsequent \"treatment\" with an education abroad experience may be irrelevant to low-risk students' probability of completing their degrees, relative to the \"untreated\" portion of their first-year cohort. Many of those untreated students would have dropped out before they, by convention, might have studied abroad. Thus, studies that simply compared graduation rates between those who studied abroad and those who did not within the same first-year cohort (e.g., Malmgren & Galvin, 2008) almost surely inflate the apparent effects of education abroad. Certainly, students who study abroad also differ from their peers along other dispositional and experiential dimensions that are rarely captured in institutional student information systems (Luo & Jamieson-Drake, 2015) . Not surprisingly, for example, students who applied for study abroad programs were distinguished from their nonapplicant peers by higher pre-existing levels of curiosity about other cultures (Carlson, 1991) . Similarly, even prior to studying abroad, program applicants were more open minded than nonapplicants (Niehoff et al., 2017) .",

First, GLOSSARI constructed a comparison group comprised of students who never studied abroad but who persisted in college through the same semester after which a \"matched\" student left campus to study abroad. Comparison group students were also matched only within the same unit of the then 33-institution University System of Georgia. This physical matching technique resulted in a sample of 19,109 undergraduates who had studied abroad and a comparable group (in terms of retention) of 17,903 students who never studied abroad. GLOSSARI found that the 4-year graduation rate for all students who studied abroad was 7.5% points higher than for peers who did not (18% improvement in rate). The overall advantage for studying abroad on 6-year graduation rates was a gain of 5.3% points (6% improvement in rate). The advantage for African-American undergraduates who studied abroad, relative to African-Americans who did not, was about 10% points higher (13% improvement in rate). For other students of color, the 6-year graduation rate for those who studied abroad was 6% points higher, relative to other students of color who did not study abroad (6% improvement in rate).",

Eight USG 4-year, full-time, more selective Southeast institutions were dropped from the sample either because they did not offer bachelor's degrees or because they had zero or nearly zero study abroad students. 1 For non-USG institutions, the CASSIE research team developed a data template and definitions document and worked with each institution to obtain the data in a consistent and secure manner. In every case, data sets from several locations on campuses needed to be merged; most commonly education abroad data needed to be combined with registrar's data, and sometimes with separate admissions and financial aid data. After extensive efforts to recruit a national sample of diverse institutions, 17 non-USG institutions ultimately supplied conforming datasets.",

Of the 30,649 participants, 86.6% studied abroad just once, 10.6% twice, and 2.8% three or more times. Of those students who studied abroad once, 5.4% participated in programs of less than 2 weeks, 43.9% studied abroad for 2-8 weeks, 8.2% studied abroad for 8 weeks to one semester, 38.7% participated in semester-long programs, and 3.8% participated in programs extending beyond a single semester. The unique granularity of information in the CASSIE data set allowed us to examine whether the effects of participation varied based on these features. For each student, term-by-term records about enrollment, cumulative GPA, declared major, and degrees conferred (if any) were obtained for up to 6 years following first matriculation, allowing us to examine 6-year graduation outcomes. For instance, for the Fall 2010 cohort we observe students up to and including Summer 2016 and for the Fall 2011 cohort until Summer 2017. In addition, demographics (age, race/ethnicity, sex), socio-economic information (Pell or other need-based aid receipt) and prior academic characteristics (high school GPA, admissions test scores) were collected, and used in our analysis. Table 3 provides descriptive statistics about the sample population (reflecting information reported for first semester of matriculation), broken down by students who had at least one education abroad experience and those who did not. As can be seen, those who studied abroad differed substantially from those who did not along a variety of characteristics. Students who studied abroad had superior academic preparation as reflected by high school GPA and SAT scores. In addition, there was a larger proportion of females but a smaller proportion of underrepresented minorities and need-based aid recipients among education abroad students. Student outcomes by education abroad status appear at the bottom of Table 3 . Based just on descriptive statistics, students who studied abroad had higher 6-year graduation rates: 95.1% versus 62.7%. The outcomes of terms to degree and GPA and credit hours earned at degree are calculated for students in the full sample who did achieve graduation within our observation period. Those who studied abroad and who graduated within 6 years did so about half a semester earlier than those who did not study abroad but also graduated. The education abroad group also displayed a higher mean cumulative GPA upon graduation. The right side of Table 3 provides the descriptive data on the 149,186 students who graduated. Among graduates, 29,146, or 20% studied abroad. We see the same dynamics as in the full sample: study abroad participants had higher levels of academic preparation and have higher percentages of female students but lower proportions of underrepresented minority and low-income students.",

In the first approach, we ran ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions, controlling for multiple covariates such as gender, race, high school GPA, and institution fixed effects. In the second approach, we estimated nearest neighbor matching models, such that students from the same institution but different study abroad participation, were matched on those covariates (Stuart, 2010) . Matching analysis has become a routine tool for analyzing the impact of educational interventions in which random assignment is not possible (Lane et al., 2012) , and has been employed in previous studies of education abroad outcomes (Waibel et al., 2015; Whatley & Clayton, 2020) .

Recently, alternative weighting procedures have been proposed to help mitigate the impact of unobserved variables on selection into treatment conditions (e.g., Oster, 2019), but the analysis reported here relies on more intuitive matching analyses.

These matching variables included gender, race/ ethnicity, and indicators of achievement prior to college such as high school GPA and SAT and are listed in the upper half of Table 3 . Students were also matched on the total number of semesters enrolled in college to minimize the comparison of students who studied abroad with students who dropped out of college prior to having the opportunity to study abroad. In addition, we matched students on institution (exact match) so that study abroad students were only matched with non-study abroad students from the same institution. The exact matching on institution mitigates the influence of institution-specific factors that may drive student outcomes, e.g., student success advising initiatives (Bettinger & Baker, 2014) , or study abroad culture on campus. In the OLS regressions, we also included institution fixed effects to account for unobserved factors peculiar to students at the same institution. For both the matching and OLS models, we clustered standard errors at the institution level.",

            "text": "In our primary analysis, students who studied abroad once or more than once were lumped together into a single treated category and compared to controls who never studied abroad. Also of interest is whether there are differences due to variations in the intensity or \"dosage\" of this treatment. Do student outcomes differ significantly for those who study abroad two or more times compared with those who study abroad just once? Similarly, the varying lengths of study abroad programs could have heterogeneous impacts, especially on the outcomes that are directly related to the passage of time such as graduating in 4 or 6 years, and semesters-to-degree. To this end, we also estimated matching models where we disaggregated number of study abroad experiences as well as study abroad experiences of varying durations. We use the Stata procedure teffects nnmatch (StataCorp, 2019) to construct our matches via nearest-neighbor matching and to calculate treatment effects. In this approach each treated student gets paired with one or more control students who are \"nearest\" to that student, where nearest is determined by a weighted function of all the matching variables (Stuart & Rubin, 2008) . Our choice of nearest-neighbor matching over other matching methods such as subclassification or full matching was driven by several factors. Given differences in institutional culture, mission, and policy it seems of paramount importance to only compare students who attend the same institution, and that intra-institutional matching was facilitated by the nearest neighbor method. Additionally, as noted by Abadie and Imbens (2002) , applying bootstrap to estimate standard errors does not result in valid inference, however Stata teffects nnmatch employs a method that does correctly estimate variance.

In a matching analysis, common support indicates that there may be some observations where there is no appropriate match (Caliendo & Kopeinig, 2008) . We used nearest neighbor matching with replacement, meaning the same control could be used to match with one or more treated. In addition, we allowed each treated student to be matched with more than one control neighbor; teffects nnmatch determines the optimal number of neighbors. Table 4 provides diagnostic information on our matches: every treated student was found to have a match among the controls, but not all controls were used as matches. A concern that arises is whether only a small number of controls were matched with the treated observations. We find that is not the case: the ratio of unique matched controls to treated students is 77% across our entire sample, and ranges from a low of 57% to a high of 105% (value greater than 100% possible because we allow for more than one nearest neighbor).",

Within each figure, the chart on the left shows the distribution of high school GPAs across treated and control prior to matching and the chart on the right is after the matches have been created. Figure 1a shows the distribution for our entire sample of students, whereas Fig. 1b shows the results when we focused on the sub-sample of those who graduated within 6 years. Prior to matching we see the high school GPA of control students was substantially different than that of treated students; after matching, the GPAs were much more comparable. Table 5 shows the results of the standardized bias calculations. Again, we show results for all students and for the subgroup of students who graduated in 6 years. Standardized bias shows the difference in covariates pre-and post-match, by taking the difference in averages and scaling by the standard deviation. An absolute value close to 0 indicates there is little difference in this variable across treated and control, whereas an absolute value close to 1 indicates a substantial difference. Among the unmatched data, the values differed from zero for most covariates. However, among the matched sample, this difference was mostly diminished. In summary, the diagnostic tests indicate the quality of matches was sufficient to produce reliable matching estimates.",

Table 8 shows the matching estimates pertaining to number of semesters during which a student was enrolled in a study abroad program. This table disaggregates the impact of study abroad for students who studied abroad once relative to not at all, twice relative to not at all, and three or more times relative to not at all. The first row shows the estimates restricted to just those who studied abroad once (versus not at all). These estimates are remarkably close to the estimates appearing in Table 7 , suggesting that findings aggregated across number of study abroad programs were not driven by \"higher dose\" students, i.e., those with more than one study abroad experience. Comparing those with two study abroad experiences to none at all, we find effect sizes that are larger (in absolute value) than the results for single-timers. However, when we look at those with three or more experiences, the estimates suffer from smaller sample sizes, and we only find statistically significant effects for the three outcomes conditional on graduating (i.e., semesters-to-graduation, GPA at graduation, and credit hours at graduation). To summarize, these results suggest that the contribution of study abroad to student success accrues to all those who study abroad-be it only once or on multiple occasions.

To do this, we first excluded students who studied abroad more than once (since their multiple programs might be of different durations). We then constructed matches across students who studied abroad and those who never did, disaggregating the former by duration of their education abroad program. For example, we compared students who studied abroad for less than 2 weeks to otherwise matched students who did not study abroad at all, and we compared students who studied abroad for 2-4 weeks with matched students who never studied abroad, and so on. Table 9 shows those matching estimates. The advantage for those who studied abroad ranged from a 3.1 to 5.9% point increase in the probability of graduating in 6 years, depending on program duration. The advantage in the probability of graduating in 4 years ranged from 3.4 to 9.8% points, depending on program duration. The positive impact on the likelihood of graduation is mostly isomorphic with program length. However, at the duration of one semester or more, the effect was diminished. For outcomes conditional on graduating, study abroad duration was associated with shorter time-to-degree, up to one semester length programs. Programs that were more than one semester did delay degree completion to a small extent. Program length does not seem to differentially impact final GPA, and the fluctuation in credit hours earned varied inconsequentially between 1 and 3 credit hours (depending on program duration). Overall, these estimates suggest that the contribution of study abroad was only weakly associated with program length.",

            "text": "This study provides evidence that participation in education abroad is associated with an increase in likelihood of timely college completion and increased GPA at graduation without causing increased time to degree or accrual of substantial extra credits. These findings associating improved college completion are consistent with findings from other singleinstitution analyses (DeSalvo & Roe, 2017; Scheider & Thornes, 2018; Xu Table 9 Matching estimates by length of study abroad program ***p < 0.01, **p < 0.05, *p < 0.1 a Sample size differs from prior tables because analysis is restricted to students who did not study abroad and those who studied abroad once (Rubin et al., 2014) . It is difficult to compare effect sizes across these studies, though, because the metrics of timely graduation differed (number of semesters, four-or 6-year rates, probabilities of four-or-6-year graduation). The present findings are likely the most conservative estimates among these studies, as the matching techniques to compare those who studied abroad with those who did not were statistically constrained and controlled for the largest number of potentially confounding variables. Indeed, the OLS multiple regressions that we report here in Table 6 yielded uniformly higher magnitudes of effect sizes than the matching analysis results reported in Table 7 . In addition, the findings of this study advance previous work by showing the effects of study abroad are not unique to particular institutions or regions and are more generalizable. Further, the findings illustrate that the association of study abroad with college completion persists in relatively recent cohorts, even though the overall pool of students who avail themselves of education abroad was larger than was the case for earlier studies. Furthermore, this study's examination of time-to-degree and credits at graduation allays concerns that education abroad imposes additional costs on students beyond the financial cost of participating in the program. The fact that education abroad students graduated on average with just a fraction of one standard course more than their non-study abroad peers contradicts common suppositions that studying abroad will contribute to substantial unapplied credits or excess effort. Similarly, the finding that education abroad students graduated on average 0.16 semesters earlier than those who did not study abroad dispels concerns that studying abroad slows time to degree or results in students incurring the cost of additional terms of enrollment. Additionally, our exploration of \"dosage effects\" reported in Tables 8 and 9 suggests that the benefits of studying abroad accrue to those who study abroad only once and to those who study abroad in short-duration programs. Some additional benefits with respect to student success outcomes do accrue from studying abroad on more than one occasion and from longer programs, up to one semester in length.",

These findings furthermore support the position that global learning is a high impact practice that fosters positive academic outcomes (Kuh, 2008) . They perhaps also support Hadis' conjecture that education abroad results in academic focusing, which in turn results in efficient degree completion. Having controlled for number of terms enrolled, we see that study abroad is associated with higher likelihood of the concrete task of completing degree requirements beyond merely remaining enrolled.",

Evidence that education abroad is associated with college completion outcomes elevates it as a practice to be supported to further both student and institutional goals. These findings have very real implications for whether study abroad is viewed as a nice enhancement for the elite few, and thus allowed to exist on the margins, versus a focus in an institution's portfolio of mechanism to improve student outcomes. The latter will enable global education to receive commensurate resources and an elevated voice in institutional planning and decision making. Furthermore, as a focal strategy, equity in international education participation and outcomes encourages institutions to utilize other research findings on barriers to participation to foster access for all students.",

These other variables include individual dispositions and traits such as open mindedness and organizational skills. Causality might be established by true experiments in which similar students are randomly assigned to an education abroad \"treatment.\" But such experiments are difficult to conceive (see Petzold & Moog, 2018) . One source of data that future studies might exploit are lists of students who applied to study abroad but who for one reason or another failed to participate in a program (e.g., Barclay Hamir, 2011) . It may be inferred that those students are more similar in terms of motivation and disposition to the study abroad enrollees than comparison groups drawn from the general student body who never studied abroad.",

Despite vigorous efforts to bring more institutions on board, only three private institutions and no small liberal arts institutions contributed data. Our experience suggests that many such institutions lacked the institutional research infrastructure to conduct the complex data compilation that CASSIE required (Rubin & Mason, 2021) . Although many such institutions are very active and innovative in international education efforts, we are unable to generalize these findings to them. Furthermore, this study focuses on a \"traditional\" population of bachelor's degree-seeking first-time first-year students. Future work should investigate similar dynamics for transfer students as well as those seeking associate degrees (see, for example, Raby et al., 2014) .",

Candidate variables to examine in this respect include education abroad destination, instructional leadership (home campus faculty or host nation faculty), and language of instruction (the student's native language or target world language). Fortunately, data on program features such as these are encoded in the CASSIE data and will be the subject of future investigation. Finally, this work illuminates the associations between education abroad and success for students in the aggregate, but not how this relationship varies by different subgroups. Study abroad is less common among populations such as low-income students and those from minoritized race and ethnicity groups, groups that have historically been less well served by higher education. It is important to ascertain whether students from such traditionally underserved groups experience disparate effects and thus determine if study abroad can be an effective means for fostering completion across groups and promoting equity in student success. Nevertheless, this study moves the field forward and prepares for this future work by using a recent national sample and rigorous methods to establish a clear relationship between study abroad and positive outcomes valued by students and institutions alike.",
