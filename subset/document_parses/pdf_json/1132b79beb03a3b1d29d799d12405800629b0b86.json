            "text": "Pneumonia is one of the most serious respiratory diseases, causes many deaths per year and is often caused by viruses, especially severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus (Levy et al., 2005) . Along with the increase in our understanding of the role of viruses in pneumonia, more findings indicate that the incidence of viral pneumonia has been underestimated (Ruuskanen et al., 2011) . Thus, further studies are urgently needed that focus on the cause and pathogenesis of viral pneumonia, better management and care of patients, and identification of safer and more effective drugs, including personalized medicine for viral pneumonia patients (Schuetz et al., 2013; Rello and Perez, 2016; Gautam et al., 2018) . Multicomponent drugs represented by traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) have drawn increasing attention in viral pneumonia treatment (Wang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . As a typical representative, Lianhuaqingwen can affect virus morphology and exert anti-inflammatory activity in vitro . Moreover, a multicenter open-label randomized controlled trial indicated that the recovery rate of patients with COVID-19 was higher in the Lianhuaqingwen treatment group than in the control group, and the median time to recovery was also shorter in the treatment group . Although these TCMs have shown better effects and fewer side effects in some cases, due to the characteristics of TCMs, such as multiple components and superposition effects, further investigations are needed to reveal their potential mechanisms and precise effects in the clinic (Wei et al., 2019a; Wei et al., 2019b) .",

Carpesium abrotanoides L. and Plantago depressa Willd. in a ratio of 250:143:36:71 (Chinese Pharmacopoeia 2020).

Survey scans were acquired after an accumulation of 5e 5 ions in the Orbitrap for m/z 300-1,400 using a resolution of 120,000 at m/z 200. The top speed data-dependent mode was selected for fragmentation in the HCD cell at a normalized collision energy of 32%, and fragment ions were then transferred into the ion trap analyzer with the AGC target at 5e 3 and maximum injection time at 35 m. The dynamic exclusion of previously acquired precursor ions was enabled at 18 s. Spectral data were searched against the mouse protein RefSeq database (downloaded on 9-26-2018) in Proteome Discoverer1.4.1.14 suites with Mascot software (version 2.3.01, Matrix Science) to achieve a false discovery rate of <1%. The mass tolerance was set at 10 ppm for precursor ions, and it was set at 0.5 Da for the tolerance of product ions. Oxidation (M) and acetylation (Protein-N term) were chosen as variable modifications, while carbamidomethylation (C) was chosen as a fixed modification, and two missed cleavage sites for trypsin were allowed.",

At the sixth day after infection, both HYQ and oseltamivir decreased the lung index of the infected mice, and at the ninth day, the high dose of HYQ and oseltamivir remained effective. The viral load in the lung tissues of the infected mice was significantly higher than that of the other mice on the sixth day after infection (Figure 2B) , and both highdose HYQ and oseltamivir reduced the viral load of the infected mice, even on the ninth day.

Administration of HYQ enhanced the proteins involved in immune system process, positive regulation of cell motility, inflammatory response and so on (p < 0.05, Figure 3E ), and proteins associated with adaptive immune response, T cell receptor signaling pathway and response to DNA damage stimulus were downregulated (p < 0.05).

Therefore, the functional changes of these proteins are consistent with the effect of the drug. Based on the statistical analyses of the measured protein amounts from each individual sample in one group (Wei et al., 2014) , we investigated the dynamics of some proteins at the proteomic level.

On the sixth day, the amounts of galectin-3-binding protein (Lgals3bp), Hpx and S100a8 in the infected mouse blood consistently increased during viral infection, whereas their expression levels in blood were all decreased by HYQ administration (p < 0.05). However, the expression level of Lgals3bp was not affected after oseltamivir administration (p > 0.05). Therefore, Lgals3bp is thought to correspond to the specific efficacy of HYQ against viral pneumonia. Moreover, oseltamivir was reported to have a potential side effect on the hepatic activities of glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione S-transferase (El-Sayed and Al-Kahtani, 2011). Thus, in some cases, HYQ may be a promising alternative treatment for viral pneumonia, and Gpx3 may be another specific signature regulated by HYQ against viral pneumonia. Overall, HYQ may have a specific effect on viral pneumonia such as elevated Lgals3bp and Gpx3 levels in the blood.",

            "text": "It was reported that a significant number of pneumonia cases are caused by viruses ; thus, safe and effective treatment is vital to improving the quality of life of patients. Along with the increase in viral pneumonia, an increasing number of traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) have been applied to viral pneumonia treatment due to their multiple constituents, multiple targets and good safety (Wang et al., 2011; Li et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2018; Hu et al., 2020; Li et al., 2020; Yang et al., 2020) . The HouYanQing (HYQ) oral liquid used in this study contains 4 types of herbs, which have all been safely used in local traditional medicine for many years. Experimental investigations of a mouse model of pneumonia infected with influenza A virus (H1N1) indicated that HYQ exerts good therapeutic efficacy in viral pneumonia, and proteomic investigations of the molecular function of proteins perturbed by HYQ indicated that HYQ enhances the proteins involved in immune system processes, negative regulation of viral genome replication, inflammatory responses, etc. Therefore, HYQ may be a promising alternative treatment for viral pneumonia. However, similar to many other TCMs, the ambiguous clinical effects and unclear mechanism hinder its extensive application in the clinic. In addition, rational use of this treatment in viral pneumonia is unclear. Proteomics-based investigation of signatures associated with the specific efficacy of HYQ against viral pneumonia shed light on this issue. With the aid of the discovered biomarkers, we concluded that HYQ has a specific effect on viral pneumonia such as elevated galectin-3-binding protein (Lgals3bp) and glutathione peroxidase 3 (Gpx3) levels in blood. Therefore, in this case, this treatment can be used more effectively, and the potential side effects can be minimized.

It was also reported that Lgals3bp expression is induced in viral infection and by many molecules that either mimic or are characteristic of ongoing inflammation and microbial infection, such as IFN-\u03b1, IFN-\u03b2, IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, and it has innate immune functions with special emphasis on viral and bacterial infections (Loimaranta et al., 2018) . Although it was found that Lgals3bp may be a serological biomarker for acute dengue virus infection , acute hantavirus infection (Hepojoki et al., 2014) , hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (Shaked et al., 2014; Yang et al., 2014; Rodr\u00edguez-Gallego et al., 2019) , and hepatitis B virus-related hepatocellular carcinoma (Liu et al., 2017) , the relationship between Lgals3bp and viral pneumonia is rarely investigated. Gpx3 protects cells and enzymes from oxidative damage (UniProt Consortium, 2015) and may be involved in immune defense against pathogenic invasion (Bathige et al., 2015) . Additionally, glutathione peroxidase 4 is reversibly induced by HCV to increase virion infectivity (Brault et al., 2016) , and glutathione peroxidase activity could be an important prognostic factor in diabetic patients with Epstein-Barr virus infection (Dworza\u0144ski et al., 2020) or as an adjuvant in the management of HIV-infected patients (Ogunro et al., 2006) . Our present study indicates that HYQ can specifically regulate Lgals3bp and Gpx3, thus exerting a good protective effect against viral pneumonia.",

In fact, transferrin, Hpx, and complement factor B and C3 have been identified by quantitative proteomics in a mouse model of influenza as potential markers of disease severity that can be clinically useful in humans (Kumar et al., 2014) , and Serping1 and complement factor B have been identified as candidate nasopharyngeal protein biomarkers in acute respiratory virus infection (Burke et al., 2017) . Among these regulated molecules, Serping1 plays a crucial role in regulating important physiological pathways, such as complement activation, and complement C3 plays a central role in the activation of the complement system (UniProt Consortium, 2015) . As an essential element of the immune system, the complement system can be activated by some viruses, and a previous study indicated that Serping1 and its network serve as important components of the innate immune system to restrict HIV-1 infection (Sanfilippo et al., 2017) . Hpx has been proven to be a candidate marker for progression of fibrosis in HCV patients (Cheung et al., 2009 ) and a potential biomarker of respiratory syncytial virus-infected pneumonia (Wang et al., 2016) . S100a8 plays a prominent role in the regulation of inflammatory processes and the immune response (UniProt Consortium, 2015) . After infection by some viruses, high expression of S100a8 is observed, resulting in enhanced oxidative stress (M\u00fcller et al., 2017) . Current experimental results showed that HYQ can also regulate these proteins and exert multiple effects on the complement system and inflammatory processes.
