Although mortality is higher in those with abnormal CXR, the difference did not reach significance (P=0.553), likely due to the small sample size. Length of hospital stay was not different among the two sub-groups. However, patients with COVID-19 who had abnormal CXRs had significantly higher CRP, lactate, and LDH levels and significantly lower PO 2 /FiO 2 compared to COVID-19 positive patients without CXR abnormalities. These findings are presented in Table 2 . In patients with abnormal CXRs who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2, mortality was 18.9% (7 of 37) in patients with abnormal CXR, compared to 2% (1 of 50) in patients without CXR infiltrations and the observed difference was highly significant (P=0.009).

Modified radiological scores have been used to evaluate the prognosis of COVID-19 patients [3, 4] , but due to the lack of specific findings in COVID-19 patients, its use is limited [5] . The prognostic capabilities of CXR and its use as a triage tool in non-severe COVID-19 patients are highlighted in a study by Sempere-Gonzales [6] . Computed tomography is being used to identify abnormalities in patients with COVID-19, but it is not available in all clinical settings and is costly compared to CXR [7, 8] . Nevertheless, computed tomography findings are related to clinical severity and prognosis, thus making it a useful supplemental tool for patients' evaluation [9, 10] In COVID-19 patients, several changes in commonly used laboratory parameters are described. In the study by Broman, IL-6 and CRP were the strongest predictors of severity in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 [11] , while in another study, it was shown that abnormal levels of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR), LDH, d-dimers, CRP, fibrinogen, and ferritin can be identified early on admission COVID-19 and can predict the severity of the disease [12] . In our study, we identify the presence of combined abnormalities of common laboratory parameters and CXR infiltrations in COVID-19 patients. Predictive scores that integrate easily available radiological and laboratory markers could be of great significance in resource-constrained settings and emergency situations [13] .",
