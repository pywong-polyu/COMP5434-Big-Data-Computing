We conducted a scoping review on the literature regarding the functional role of AKNA according to the evidence found in human and in vivo and in vitro models, stringently following the \"PRISMA-ScR\" statement recommendations. Methods: We undertook an independent PubMed literature search using the following search terms, AKNA OR AKNA ADJ gene OR AKNA protein, human OR AKNA ADJ functions. Observational and experimental articles were considered. The selected studies were categorized using a pre-determined data extraction form. A narrative summary of the evidence was produced. Results: AKNA modulates the expression of CD40 and CD40L genes in immune system cells. It is a negative regulator of inflammatory processes as evidenced by knockout mouse models and observational studies for several autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, AKNA contributes to the de-regulation of the immune system in cancer, and it has been proposed as a susceptibility genetic factor and biomarker in CC, GC, and HNSCC. Finally, AKNA regulates neurogenesis by destabilizing the microtubules dynamics. Conclusion: Our results provide evidence for the role of AKNA in various cellular processes, including immune response, inflammation, development, cancer, autoimmunity, and neurogenesis.",

The 61-kb long akna gene contains 24 exons that encode nine different transcripts as the result of alternative promoter usage, splicing, and two polyadenylation sites [1, 5] . AKNA contains a 9-amino-acid sequence (RTRGRPADS) that satisfies the consensus requirements of an AT-hook DNA-binding motif. AKNA also possesses three PEST regions associated with proteolysis [5] . The 69-kDa F1 isoform was the first to be described, and it is one of the few functionally tested [1, 6] . It contains an N-and a C-terminus AT-hook domain, which enable the protein to bind to AT-rich DNA regions.",

To assess the quality of a study, an 11-item specific scale, based on the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) principles, was developed by consensus among the nine authors. Each item was categorized considering the introduction, methods, results, and discussion. The items covered study design, recruitment, and description of participants, as well as global quality ( Table 1 ). The score was expressed in arbitrary units (a.u.) ranging from 0 to 22 (lower to higher quality). ARG and KTP independently evaluated the quality, and any disagreement was resolved after discussion. The quality of in vivo primary studies that were included in this scoping review was assessed using the Animal Research: Reporting in vivo Experiments (ARRIVE) guidelines, a checklist of 20 items describing the minimum information that scientific publications reporting research using animals should include. This includes the number and specific characteristics of animals used (including species, strain, sex, and genetic background); details of housing and husbandry; the experimental, statistical, and analytical methods (including details of methods used to reduce bias such as randomization and blinding) ( Table 2 ) [10] . The first 5 studies performed in vivo assays only; the 3 remaining studies featured both in vitro and in vivo assays. Criteria: (1) A title that provides a concise description of the content of the article; (2) A structured abstract with details of the animal species or strain of animal used; (3) A background that explains the experimental approach; (4) Objectives that describe the specific hypotheses being tested; (5) A methods section with an ethical statement for the care and use of ani-mals that cover the research; (6) A study design described for each experiment (number of experimental and control groups, steps taken to minimize bias, experimental units); (7) Experimental procedures described (how, when, where, and why for each experiment and each experimental group, including controls); (8) Experimental animals (details of the ani-mals used and their source); (9) Housing and husbandry (details and welfare-related assessment and interventions); (10) Sample size (number of animals in each experiment and each experimental group, the calculation method used and num-ber of replicates); (11) Allocating animals to experimental groups (randomizations or matching, order of treatment and assessment); (12) Experimental outcomes (primary and secondary outcomes assessed); (13) Statistical methods (unit of anal-ysis and details of the methods used); (14) In the results section, baseline data for each experimental unit before treatment); (15) Numbers analyzed (number of animals in each group included in each analysis); (16) Outcomes and estimation (results for each analysis with a measure of precision); (17) Adverse events (details in each experimental group); (18) In the discus-sion section, scientific implications (interpretation of the results, limitations of the study); (19) Generalizability (translation of the findings and relevance to human biology); (20) Funding (sources and role of the funder). * Indicates the fulfillment of the criterion.",

In four of the five studies related to infection-associated cancer, cancer was the only disease investigated: cervical cancer (CC) [6, 27] ; gastric cancer (GC) [25] , and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) [22] . Considering the number of individuals included, the most widely studied disease related to AKNA was degenerative knee osteoarthritis (KOA) (57.4% of participants in two studies) [28, 30] . Two studies investigated the participation of AKNA in other autoimmune diseases, pSS (progressive systemic sclerosis) [29] , and VKH (Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease) [26] , representing 6% of all participants, and one publication evaluated disorders associated to chronic respiratory infectious diseases (PCD, primary ciliary dyskinesia) [24] . To identify differentially expressed membrane proteins in patients with active Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome (VKH) and controls A possible regulation of the CD18 molecule (integrin B2, which participates in cell adhesion, neutrophil chemotaxis, and cell signaling) was found, and a role in apoptosis of CD4 + T cells and a decreased level of AKNA expression could be observed, along with a possible down-regulation in the expression of CD40L in T cells Two polymorphisms were associated with SIL and CC, and an association between high akna expression levels and CC and SIL was identified, although its effects differed in each disease stage. To show the potential existence of a cis-acting polymorphism, the akna allelic expression imbalance was evaluated for the alleles of the\u22121372C4A polymorphism, and the number of transcripts derived from the A allele was found to be significantly higher than those from the C allele Regarding the five in vivo studies (Table 5) , two independent gene-targeting mouse models engineered to assess the in vivo physiological significance of the AKNA were evaluated, a) akna knockout (KO) mice with deletion of the putative C-terminus AT-hooklike motif sequence of AKNA, and b) AKNA-KO with disruption of AKNA's exon 3 (AKNA KO2) [11] . In either scenario, the resulting mice were smaller and weaker than WT; most of them died by day 10 of neonatal age. Causes of death included acute inflammatory reactions and alveolar destruction. Acute inflammation appeared to be characterized by a systemic neutrophil mobilization, alveolar infiltration, concerted activation of neutrophil-specific chemokines and cytokines, and the presence of extracellular matrix-remodeling enzymes. This study provided experimental support to the hypothesis that AKNA participates in the mechanisms that regulate the magnitude of inflammatory responses to pathogens [11] .",

That same publication showed that AKNA mRNA was predominantly expressed in lymphoid organs, including the spleen and lymph nodes as well as peripheral blood leukocytes, natural killer cells, and dendritic cells [5] . At least nine distinct transcripts of AKNA have been identified, some of which are expressed in a tissue-specific manner (thymus and/or tonsils) and can be post-translationally modified [1] , raising the possibility that different cells may preferentially express one isoform and/or that different circumstances may dictate the preference for one isoform. Altogether, these data suggest an important role for AKNA in the regulation of immune function, particularly through signaling resulting of the CD40-CD40L interaction.",

After a previous study had revealed that the T-2 toxin induced the expression of inflammatory cytokines and inhibited AKNA mRNA expression, the work by Liu et al. investigated the T-2 toxin-induced signaling pathway that regulates AKNA mRNA expression and its effect on the secretion of inflammatory cytokines and the production of growth hormone in rats. The T-2 toxin induced pCREB and NF-\u03baB/p-p65 direct binding to the AKNA promoter, inhibiting AKNA mRNA expression while relocating the existing AKNA molecules from the cytoplasm to the nucleus to regulate the expression of downstream genes that have an AT sequence, particularly pro-inflammatory cytokines [17] . This study provided new insights into the signaling pathway leading to AKNA expression, stressing the role of AKNA in the inflammatory response. In addition, this work raised the concern that chronic exposure to low doses of this mycotoxin may directly impact human health.",

Furthermore, p53 was shown to interact with AKNA, promoting the expression of AKNA, leading the authors to propose that by downregulating the expression of CD40, the E6/p53/AKNA axis de-regulates the immune system, favoring tumor growth [20] .

Furthermore, data presented in that study suggest that by regulating the centrosomal microtubule organization, AKNA may participate in the epithelial-to-mesenchymal (EMT) transition in tumor epithelial cells, a possibility also raised by Wang et al.

The multiple AKNA transcripts identified in different immune cell types (mature tonsil lymphocytes or thymic lymphocytes) suggest a potential differential expression of AKNA with different targets and functions, depending on the cell type or isoform [1] . Particularly, AKNA binding to AT-rich regions on the CD40 and CD40L promoters has been shown to regulate the expression of these co-receptors, modulating several immune cells functions, including the generation and maintenance of nTreg cells, revealing new functions for CD40-CD40L and AKNA [5, 16] . Regarding the regulation of AKNA expression, the findings presented by Liu et al., identified pCREB and p-p65/NF-kB as two transcription factors that inhibit AKNA expression [17] . As the expression of AKNA in different tissues and cells evidences a role for this protein beyond the immune system, understanding the molecular mechanisms that regulate AKNA expression in different tissues opens a field for future research. One avenue to investigate would be whether pCREB and p-p65 NF-kB are regulated by a signaling pathway downstream of the cPLA 2 \u03b1 activity, as demonstrated by Suram et al. [12] .",

While searching for polymorphisms associated with racing performance in racing horses, a deletion causing a shift of the reading frame of akna was identified [15] . Although the authors did not further characterize whether this SNP results in a premature stop codon or a truncated protein, this finding raises questions about the precise function of AKNA in modulating the different systems (musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, metabolic, nervous) involved in racing performance.",

Low levels of AKNA promote the stem cells to remain in the stem cell niche, whereas higher levels of expression favor their detachment and migration out of the stem cell niche to differentiate, a phenomenon known as delamination [18] . Delamination processes are primarily mediated by the effect of AKNA on microtubule dynamics by destabilizing apical microtubule-actin-AJ complexes, which promote the constriction of apical end feet [18, 31] . Consistent with this new role of AKNA in neurogenesis favoring the delamination processes [31] , a frameshift variant in exon 12 of akna was recently reported to co-segregate with microcephaly, a prenatal condition with varying degrees of intellectual disability. The frameshift was predicted to result in a truncated C-terminus [32] , shown by Camargo et al. to be indispensable for the localization of AKNA in the centrosome and for normal brain development [18] .",

A study aiming to evaluate chromosomal and genetic alterations in cisplatin-sensitive and cisplatin-resistant human testicular germ cell tumors identified a downregulation of AKNA in the cisplatin-resistant tumors with chromosomal rearrangements in the 9q32-q33.1 region [24] . This study suggested a role for this transcription factor in downregulating the expression of molecules associated with the cisplatin-sensitive phenotype. Similarly, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the AT-binding region of AKNA are associated with a higher risk to develop cervical cancer [6] , suggesting that impairing the function of AKNA favors the acquisition of a transformed phenotype. Along the same line, the publications by Martinez-Nava et al. [27] , Manzo-Merino et al. [20] , Wang et al. [25] , and recently Liao et al. [33] on bladder cancer indicate that AKNA participates and is somehow downregulated in different cancer types with an epithelial origin, revealing a protective role for AKNA in cell transformation. Interestingly, the study by Camargo et al. reported that AKNA mRNA levels were regulated by Sox4, a master regulator of epithelial-mesenchymal transition, tumor growth, and metastasis, consistent with all those previous publications describing a role for AKNA in cancer.",

(2017) [17] AKNA is suggested to be a key regulator of T-2 toxin-mediated inflammation and growth hormone deficiency AKNA has a significant role in T-2 toxin-induced inflammatory response and growth inhibition. The PKA/CREB and NF-\u03baB pathway participate in the signaling regulating AKNA expression Manzo-Merino et al. (2018) [20] AKNA expression is lower in CC tissue than in normal tissues Inherent AKNA deficiency in neoplastic epithelial cells, not found in immune cells that conform the tumoral inflammatory infiltrate The HPV E6 oncoprotein de-regulate AKNA and CD40 expression. This event involves the action of p53 The E6/p53/AKNA axis might play an important role in the de-regulation of the immune system during HR-HPV-induced carcinogenesis in CC promoting epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) Restoration of AKNA levels in HeLa cells induces the expression of interleukin 8 (IL-8) The inflammatory status promoted by HPV via p53/AKNA dampens immune response favoring tumor growth Mart\u00ednez et al.
