The first two chapters of this book will help answer this question. Like a good detective, you need to gather the important clues, ignore distractions and red herrings, and eliminate the other suspects-all in a timely manner. This chapter will provide you with a stepwise approach to: \u274f Taking an appropriate and focused history by gathering relevant clinical information from multiple sources. \u274f Identifying the common symptoms associated with (and not associated with) acute stroke. Chapter 2 will discuss various stroke mimics and how to clinically differentiate them. and try to minimize transportation time to the most appropriate stroke center. The mnemonic FAST, which stands for Face (sudden facial droop), Arm (sudden unilateral arm weakness), Speech (sudden speech difficulty), and Time to call EMS, is being used to promote public awareness. Most prehospital stroke screening tools involve some combination of these cardinal symptoms.",

Sometimes the exact time of onset is unknown/uncertain or difficult to obtain, but try to really pin it down. Use clock time (i.e., 23:00), rather than \"2 h ago,\" or \"30 min ago.\" If the patient woke up with symptoms (i.e., a wake-up stroke), when were they last seen well? Did they get up in the middle of the night to use the washroom and were they normal then? If the patient woke up with symptoms in the morning without previous awakenings, we must use their last seen normal time which is typically when they went to bed. A common reason for ineligibility for tPA is arrival at the hospital too late, beyond the time window for treatment (although this is an evolving area of clinical research, and advanced imaging may enable the use of tPA outside the traditional time window).",
