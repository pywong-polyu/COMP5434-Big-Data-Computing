The pcDNA3.1-nef-vpr-gp160-p24 and pcDNA3.1nef constructs were prepared in large scale as endotoxin-free form. Moreover, the recombinant Nef-Vpr-Gp160-p24 polypeptide and Nef protein were generated inE. coli. These constructs were delivered using cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) in vivo, and immune responses were assessed for different modalities in BALB/c mice.

            "text": "Common vaccines, including live weakened or killed pathogens make up first-generation vaccines. Live weakened pathogens are usually much more effective and can induce humoral and cellular immune responses. However, concern about the safety of these vaccines prevents them from spreading and applying to diseases such as AIDS (Li and Petrovsky2015) . In contrast, killed vaccines that are not dangerous cannot provide strong cellular immune responses and do not apply to all types of diseases. Therefore, to minimize the risks of first-generation vaccines, second-generation vaccines were developed as subunit vaccines. The new-generation vaccines are made from pathogenic parts such as protein antigens, synthetic peptides or polysaccharides. The limitations of this type of vaccines are their low ability to stimulate cellular immune responses and really low immunogenicity (Li and Petrovsky2015) . Thus, the use of adjuvants and delivery systems, as well as heterologous prime/boost regimens was suggested to solve these problems. The studies indicated that repeated vaccine injections strengthen immune responses against the vaccine components. These strategies were known as prime/boost combination strategies. Initially, the immune system is stimulated by a vaccine candidate (prime) and re-stimulated with a similar (homologous) or different (heterologous) vaccine candidate with similar antigens as a reminder (boost) (Lu2009). For example, DNA prime/ protein boost regimens could be effective in stimulating immune responses. DNA vaccines have the potential to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses as the third generation of vaccines. However, their disadvantages can be reduced by heterologous prime/boost regimens and the use of delivery systems or adjuvants.",

The Montanide ISA-720 and its derivatives have been evaluated in various trials of malaria and AIDS vaccine. These adjuvants were very well tolerated when injected as a pharmaceutical formulation, and various clinical trials showed high tolerance of these compounds in combination with antigens. Various studies have demonstrated the ability of Montanide ISA-720 to enhance antibody titers as well as specific responses to cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) (Aucouturier et al.2002) . Moreover, delivery systems including cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are a group of peptides that can cross different cell membranes with no lethal damage to the membrane (Jafari et al.2017) . MPG and HR9 are examples of CPPs used to deliver DNA cargoes into the cells. MPG amphipathic peptide (27 amino acids) was composed of SV40 NLS and HIV glycoprotein 41 (gp41) separated by a linker (Wang et al.2014) . Histidine-rich R9 (HR9, CH5-R9-H5C) contains polyhistidine and nona arginine (R9) sequences that are surrounded by two cysteine residues for increasing the delivery of DNA cargoes within the cells (Liu et al.2015; Lo and Wang2008; Huang et al.2015) . On the other hand, a new cysteinerich cationic CPP derived from crotamine known as CyLoP-1 has been recently developed to deliver peptide and protein cargoes (Ponnappan et al.2017; Jha et al.2011) . LDP-NLS is another CPP containing Latarcin-derived peptide (LDP) and the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of SV40 for delivery of protein and peptide cargoes into the cell (Ponnappan and Chugh2017; Dubovskii et al.2015; Ragin et al.2002) .",

In addition, safety of the designed constructs is critical for human use. Up to now, therapeutic vaccines achieved to clinical trials had some disadvantages (e.g., low immunogenicity, the lack of safety or high viral load). Thus, it is required to find novel vaccine strategies against HIV infection. The aim of this study was the design of a novel polyepitope construct and evaluation of its immunogenicity in mice. In our previous study, the pEGFPnef-vpr-gp160-p24 construct and the Nef-Vpr-Gp160-P24 polypeptide complexed with CPPs were designed for in vitro studies (Davoodi et al.2019a,b) . Herein, following in vitro studies, the pcDNA-nef-vpr-gp160-p24 and pcDNA-nef constructs, and the Nef-Vpr-Gp160-P24 polypeptide and Nef protein were prepared in large scale and endotoxin-free form. MPG & HR9 peptides and CyLoP-1 & LDP-NLS peptides were used to deliver DNA, and polypeptide/protein, respectively. Finally, humoral and cellular immune responses induced by different modalities using Nef-Vpr-Gp160-P24 and Nef antigens were evaluated and compared in BALB/c mice. Indeed, the efficiency of Nef-Vpr-Gp160-P24 regimens was compared with Nef regimens as an antigen candidate in HIV vaccine development. Briefly, the roles of CPPs, Montanide adjuvant and heterologous prime-boost strategy were evaluated to increase the immunogenicity of a polytope construct and a protein candidate in vivo. In addition, the potency of a polytope antigen against a protein antigen was determined to induce immune responses.",

The immunogenicity of the designed construct was compared with Nef protein as an antigen candidate in therapeutic vaccine. Some studies have focused on Nef, a highly conserved and immunogenic regulatory protein in vaccine design (Mann and Ndungu2015; Abraham and Fackler2012; Jafarzade et al.2016; Kadkhodayan et al.2017 ). In addition, many of the completed HIV-1 vaccine experiments have used recombinant viral vectors or DNA vaccines in combination with other traditional vector-based vaccines. Immune responses primed by injection of an antigen-encoding DNA could be enhanced using recombinant proteins or viruses through ''prime/boost'' strategies. In animal models, these approaches have increased the number of neutralizing antibodies and DNA-based CTL responses (Kutzler and Weiner2008) . Several studies used a set of proteins as multivalent immunogens in vaccine design. One of these strategies was the The level of cytokines was determined in the supernatant with ELISA as mean absorbance at 450 nm \u00b1 SD for each set of samples. All analyses were performed in duplicate for each sample. Significant differences were shown by *p \\ 0.05, **p \\ 0.01, ***p \\ 0.001, and non-significant difference was shown by ns (p [ 0.05) bioinformatics design of artificial proteins that could cover different epitopes. The challenge for these strategies was to design vaccines that could provide protective responses against the highly diverse range of HIV-1 viruses (Korber et al.2017) . So far, several peptide vaccines including HIV-v (Vpr, Vif, Rev, Nef), C4-V3 (Gp120), VAC3S (Gp41), VACC-4X (p24Gag), F4/AS01B (p24, RT, Nef, p17) and have been developed by various scientists, but the capacity of these vaccines has also been limited to increase HIV-specific immune responses (Leal et al.2017) .",

The level of Granzyme B was determined with ELISA as mean absorbance at 450 nm \u00b1 SD for each set of samples. All analyses were performed in duplicate for each sample.

Our main approach was the stimulation of cellular immunity and cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Therefore, the epitopes were selected to simultaneously stimulate CD4 ? (T helper) and CD8 ? (cytotoxic T) T cells based on online softwares. Herein, it seems that the simultaneous use of the mentioned epitopes increases vaccine success. Moreover, due to the increase in the length of the polyepitope peptide, two main drawbacks of peptide vaccines including low immunogenicity and MHC limitation were eliminated because they acquire the characteristics of protein vaccines without areas that are not immunogenic or do not have effective immunogenicity. Elimination of non-immunogenic components also reduces the side effects of the vaccine (Purcell et al.2007 ). On the other hand, many studies have focused on increasing immunogenicity by using immune stimulants or adjuvants. Adjutants act by activating the innate immune system and providing key signals that regulate the acquired immune response. As a result, they stimulate antigen-specific T helper cells (Th1, Th2, and Th17) and ultimately lead to immunity (Bonam et al.2017; Draper et al.2015) . In this study, the Montanide ISA-720 adjuvant was used. This adjuvant has an FDA license for use in human vaccines (Tsang et al.2017) .",

DNA vaccines are easily destroyed by DNase and lysozyme, and the injected naked plasmid DNA is poorly distributed and inefficiently expressed. Therefore, DNA vaccines must be injected by a delivery system to increase immune responses (Tian et al.2014 ). Cell-penetrating peptides were widely used to deliver proteins, plasmid DNAs, RNAs, oligonucleotides, liposomes, and anticancer drugs into the cells (Borrelli et al.2018) . CPPs are generally bound to biomolecules by covalent binding or forming non-covalent complexes (Kawamoto et al.2011; Simeoni2003) . The important benefits of forming non-covalent complexes are the ease of complex preparation and conservation of cargo characteristics (Huang et al.2015) . In this study, four cell penetrating peptides were used to effectively deliver the DNA, polypeptide or protein constructs. We used three prime/boost vaccine strategies including DNA prime/DNA boost (homologous), protein prime/protein or polypeptide boost (homologous), and DNA prime/protein or polypeptide boost (heterologous) strategies. The best efficiency of immune responses was observed in the heterologous (G7-G12) and homologous protein/polypeptide groups (G4-G6) compared to homologous DNA groups (G1-G3). An increase in the ratios of IgG2a and IgG2b to IgG1 in heterologous groups indicated the tendency of the immune responses to Th1 (cellular immunity). Moreover, an increase in the ratios of IFN-c to IL-5 and IL-10 cytokines in these groups showed the direction of the immune responses to Th1 (cellular immunity). Increased production of Granzyme B in these groups was also an indicator of CTL activity. Indeed, in the heterologous prime/boost groups, the highest immune response was related to IgG2a, IgG2b, and IFN-c (tendency to Th1) for both antigens. Generally, the use of three strategies including heterologous prime/boost, MPG/HR9 for DNA delivery and CyLoP-1/LDP-NLS for protein or polypeptide delivery could significantly activate both T-and B-cells against both antigens.",

Besides, the use of MPG as a DNA delivery system increased the immunological efficiency of DNA construct (Kardani et al.2016) . In another study, Kadkhodayan and colleagues indicated that the heterologous HIV-1 Tat (CPP)-Nef DNA prime/ HIV-1 Tat (CPP)-Nef protein boost strategy increased IgG2a, IFN-c, and Granzyme B secretion in BALB/c mice. They used Cady-2 cell penetrating peptide as a non-covalent protein delivery system as well as Tat CPP as a covalent delivery system (Kadkhodayan et al.2017 ). In the current study, the results of immune responses showed that the heterologous prime/boost regimens using both Nef-Vpr-Gp160-P24 and Nef antigens induced significantly the secretion of IgG2a, IgG2b, IFN-c and Granzyme B in comparison with other groups. The levels of Granzyme B in mice immunized with Nef antigen were higher than those immunized with Nef-Vpr-Gp160-P24 antigen.
