Scandals arising out of sharing data during medical research have pointed out that going beyond the requirements of law may be necessary for sustaining trust in data-intensive health research. We propose building upon the use of a social licence for achieving such ethical governance.",

We used a systematic search and selection process, followed by a critical conceptual analysis. The systematic search resulted in nine publications. Our conceptual analysis aims to clarify how societal permission can be granted to health research projects which rely upon the reuse and/or linkage of health data. These activities may be morally demanding. For these types of activities, a moral legitimation, beyond the limits of law, may need to be sought in order to preserve trust. Our analysis indicates that a social licence encourages us to recognise a broad range of stakeholder interests and perspectives in data-intensive health research. This is especially true for patients contributing data. Incorporating such a practice paves the way towards an ethical governance, based upon trust. Public engagement that involves patients from the start is called for to strengthen this social licence.",

Greater trust can be achieved in the governance of data-intensive health research by highlighting strategic dialogue with both patients contributing the data, and the public in general. This should ultimately contribute to a more ethical practice of governance.",

In the 1950s, American sociologist Everett Hughes used the term in his work on occupational relations [6, 7] . The concept was originally used to describe the level of approval from communities for certain professions to carry out activities that require more than regulatory permission. The social licence was later introduced into discussions about corporate social responsibility and sustainability [8] . The mining industry is probably the most notable example of a context in which the term has been widely used. Here it emerged that, in order to act responsibly, an additional moral duty exists-beyond compliance with laws and regulations. Only then could businesses gain ongoing approval for their activities from local stakeholders [9] .",

Now, following the problems encountered by care.data in the UK, Carter and colleagues have drawn the concept into the domain of health data research [2] . This care.data initiative to bundle up and share primary care medical records for research purposes faced criticism. Critics argued it disregarded patient objections, suffered from a low level of public awareness and transparency, and encountered problems in its communication and oversight strategies. The initiative was paused, and eventually abandoned entirely [10] . The care.data example underscores the need to recognise that public and patient trust is a serious prerequisite for realising successful health data research. Therefore, like the mining or logging industry, data-intensive health research must be viewed as an activity in which the public's interest is at stake. This is echoed in social contract theory, in which Big Data have recently been characterised as altering the nature of the implicit social contract underlying the relationship between governments and governed [11] . Whereas this social contract perspective focuses on the implications of Big Data on the politics of the state, the social licence approach is better suited to the public-private context of data-intensive health research. Nevertheless, by the same token, the social contract too stresses trust and justice in order to amend the adverse effects of Big Data on privacy and transparency [12] .",

New analytical tools have become even more refined in order to identify associations and patterns within data.

Studies consistently show that people want to be able to trust researchers to be transparent and responsible. People believe researchers to be capable of making an effort to provide information, of maximising data security, minimising risk, and holding accountable those who abuse and misuse the data [16] .

Three definitions specify the party granting the licence, namely, the 'publics' [26] or 'communities and relevant stakeholders' [23, 25] . All definitions name the party who is granted the social licence. Whereas some definitions simply refer to the parties receiving the social licence as 'entities' or 'organisations' [20, 23] , as well as industries [25] , others clarify the nature of these parties as occupational or professional [2, 19, 21] . One definition refers to 'corporations' specifically [2] . Two explicitly state that parties may be private but also public [22, 25] . The licence is granted to the receiving party to carry out 'particular activities' [2, 19] . No definition actually elucidates the activities any further than 'to do things' [21] or 'doing certain work' [23] . Yet some do qualify the nature of those 'things' a bit further. The activities for which a social licence is granted typically deviate from common modes of behaviour [19] . They constitute activities that have broad societal impacts [24] , that other members of society are not allowed to do, or that may not be morally acceptable in the wider society [21, 22] . It is exactly because these activities are morally questionable or demanding that, in order for parties to act responsibly, they need to submit themselves to codes of conduct that go beyond legal or formal regulation [2, 20] . Four definitions mention the reasons why a social licence is granted or how a party can obtain a social licence. The party wishing to obtain a social licence for its activities will need to attest that those activities are acceptable in the eyes of society [22] . For activities to be deemed acceptable by society, they need to meet societal or public expectations [2, 22, 24, 25] . Three definitions explicitly mention that the public must be 'satisfied' that the activities to be carried out are 'trustworthy' [20, 25, 26] . One suggests special attention should be given to mistrust by particular communities [26] . Transparency, open communication [24, 26] , engagement [24, 25] , and data governance strategies are all emphasised as examples of how to gain trustworthiness [26] . A social licence is gained by trust in the voluntary adherence to social codes of trustworthy and responsible behaviour, reflecting ethical and societal standards [20] .

In this account, however, a social licence is a moral requirement and not optional. By adding a focus on engagement and participation, giving greater attention to societal values and expectations, it thus becomes a norm in itself, beyond formal regulation [5, 27, 28] . As such, a social licence helps to establish the trustworthiness of the research project at large on top of the obligatory ethical safeguards. In doing so it involves all institutions and researchers of the research project in question [1, 29, 30] . By building trust in voluntary adherence to codes of conduct, there is less need to formalise good behaviour by introducing even more rules and regulations. A social licence can actually be viewed as allowing for more freedoms and to alleviate restrictions. Researchers, for instance, can assume they have a social licence to reuse data because of a positive public attitude resulting from their trustworthy and responsible behaviour.",

This division of moral labour has been justified, while at the same time, 'lay' and societal stakeholders have largely been left out [6, 32] . The purpose and requirements of a social licence therefore reside beyond the specificities of a particular law. In this way, a social licence fulfils a communicative, informational, and educational need towards both the medical practitioners and the public [33, 34] . In addition, it can work the other way too, opening up similar learning possibilities for the researchers and institutions involved in data-intensive health research.

First of all, social licence warns us that current frameworks of governance risk losing their patients' support. In an approach based upon social licence, the formulation of the role of citizens and patients in data research, the taking into account of their attitudes towards the 'public good' , and their participation within data-intensive research is, instead, carried out from the bottom-up. As yet, these efforts are highly circumscribed by the perspective of the dominant, predetermined, data-intensive research goals [35, 36] . In times of rising costs and cutting back services this conforms to a general trend within the governance of health. Governance is becoming infused with norms instigating, or implicitly 'nudging' , citizens to behave according to a predetermined, instrumentalist view of the public interest. Within this view, bottom-up input is merely seen as a useful tool for influencing behaviour. And so public interest is not seen as an end in itself, but rather as a means towards the end of making more data-intensive health research possible [37] .",

These misconceptions are found to be based on generalised assumptions about consent, support, and participation, originating in specific, particular, and limited studies [2, 39] . When transferred, and employed in practice, to legitimise data collection in the different context of data-intensive health research, this reaps uncertainty about the assumption of data-intensive health research's public value for society. In addition, its status as a common good is bound to be problematic due to a greater multiplicity of goals. Some of these goals, especially those shaped and influenced by private interests, transcend the argument of pure public service. Also, considering, on the one hand, the data contributions of patients to research, and, on the other hand, contributions of data research to the public good, the risks and benefits involved in data sharing and access are perceived as unevenly distributed [2] . This is an especially pressing obstacle because it will result in sentiments of unfairness, and a lack of reciprocity [2] . As a consequence, trust is damaged. Moreover, the extent to which the protection of risks is able to mitigate these worrying developments, and with it the legitimacy of data-intensive health research, is questioned [40, 41] .",

Social licence sheds light on the caution as well as the nuanced and delicate appreciation needed for societal support and cooperation [19] . The starting point is that research must be seen once more as a subcategory of medicine, one which is particularly subject to more than regular medical risks alone. To be more specific, the context of data-intensive research adds renewed weight to, and intensifies, the risks to society and the communities which are involved [19, 42] . For not only do some health data research projects today involve co-operations which cross the public/private divide, they are also unprecedented in their international scale and usefulness [43] . As a new vein of research, this challenges the self-evidence that health research is in line with medicine's entrenched orientation towards the collective [44] . These facets, therefore, have a significant effect upon the extent to which the institutional organisation and structure of data-intensive health research is up to its task of realising a research practice that is perceived to be ethically sound. The question is not whether prevailing ethical safeguards are fit for purpose, but rather to what extent they can adequately respond to the heightened social dimension of what ethical research today consists of.",

The relationship between patients' and public attitudes and medical research has become far more critical and dynamic than was ever the case [46] . As a consequence, societal expectations cannot be assumed; they are less self-evidently supportive than before [46] . The value of the social licence lies in its response to this context. It highlights the fact that governance for dataintensive health research projects requires a revised and renewed mandate of its own [6] . This mandate goes beyond the one conferred upon them by law, and beyond a mandate assumed from prior health research. This renewal is needed in order to establish, or rather retain social legitimacy for medical research [19, 47] . Just as 'lay' evaluations of data-intensive medical practice rely greatly on the regulation and prevention of risks, such a mandate also contains a fragile mix of safety concerns and conceptions of the value of the research as a social good [40] . In this context, risk is 'intricately and inevitably tied to the development of new organisational forms and logics that underlie the way that services are organised, managed and held accountable' [48] .",

Instead, for the governance of data-intensive health research, the presumed moral guidance and trustworthiness need to be validated, since the medical profession is just one stakeholder among many others [52] . The whole concept of a social licence centres upon the integration of stakeholder perceptions and evaluations-most essentially those of patients-on which a mandate can be built [9, 20] . This, in turn, rests on the recognition of an, albeit more fragile, 'reflexively organized dialectic of trust and doubt, certainty and uncertainty' [46] .

Quintessentially, the literature confirms that social licence requires apt medical research regulation and governance in order to ensure data researchers adhere to these values [19] . Therefore, the use of novel and secure data management technologies is highlighted as key to achieving social licence. These practical mechanisms foster transparency and accountability [20] .

Practically, trust is pivotal in data-intensive health research, as actions cannot be fully overseen nor governed. This is simply because it is not yet known, nor may ever fully be known beforehand, what actions will be concerned with [2, 45] . Regarding such high, uncertain, and unforeseeable risks, it has been pointed out that trust resides beyond abstract systems [58] . This is pivotal in our thinking about the fostering of trust in governance. Mostly, the contribution of research ethics in relation to governance boils down to the analysis of the values it promotes, leading to recommendations at a formal, structural and organisational level. Instead, social licence demands a thorough development of the concept of trust, shifting our attention towards an ethical governance which revolves around interpersonal vulnerability, moral agency, and voluntary reciprocity [58] . It requires a shift towards a softer side of organising ethical governance. This would encompass notions such as shared [5] , or rather, reflexive health governance [59] , which focuses on mutual learning, understanding of perspectives and actions, and lastly, communication, interaction, and deliberation. These notions are well suited to encapsulate this focus into a practical governance framework [59, 60] .",

They may, in fact, be counterproductive, doing even more harm than good in establishing conditions for trust to flourish [58] . Alternatively, a focus on trustworthiness flips the perspective, in which social licence implies a performative function for the 'lay' stakeholder. In this way patient involvement in governance facilitates co-creating what is considered as trustworthy [5, 64] . Further research is warranted into why and how stakeholders perceive, evaluate and act upon dataintensive health research as they do.

The actual co-creation of data governance, based on strategic dialogue and discussion, may yield great promise in this direction. One particularly fruitful way in which this can be achieved is by organising what is known as 'extended fora' [45] . Such fora, in the true sense of a public meeting place, may include a widening array of stakeholders that are active within data-intensive health research. A multifaceted approach to the participation of patients and members of the public, involving individuals and communities [45] , is promoted as vital for a socially responsible research process. It will, at the same time, prevent tokenism and unrepresentative participation [45, 54] . A reflective approach to these extended fora underscores the point that engagement forms a tool for meaningful, transparent consideration of public values, interests and concerns [54, 59] . This, in turn, facilitates a more genuine open exchange of information and greater equity in the relationship between science and public [1] . By pursuing shared decision-making, ways of working can be built upon the articulated requirements for a social licence.

Those liberties in turn demand trustworthiness, coming with duties to act in ethically acceptable ways. This is defined as behaviour that addresses concerns about data privacy and risk, and that promotes public values such as transparency, reciprocity, inclusivity, and the common good. Furthermore, technical requirements are important in addressing data security concerns, because these affect perceived, as well as actual risk. However, these alone will not be sufficient to establish and maintain a social licence. Public engagement and co-creation of norms should also be heavily prioritised as duties in order to understand what expectations stakeholders and society at large hold. In this way, the joint action is possible which is needed in order to achieve public engagement and co-creation. The social licence cannot be taken for granted; it calls for action.",

Yet this effort must be infused by the open exchange of information and perceptions, fostering trust, mutual learning, and enhancing communication in the relationship between science and the public. In this regard, readily understood information, that is of practical use, which matters, and is accessible to members of the public is important for the ability to hold researchers to a code of conduct drawn up by both parties. Besides the process, and the design of its implementation, greater attention should be given to aspects of interaction and dialogue occurring within specific contexts of a social licence [9] . The concept of social licence highlights just how important and fragile the linking of all these elements is. Achieving a sustainable ethical governance requires all involved to acknowledge these dimensions in order to be able to tackle them together.",
