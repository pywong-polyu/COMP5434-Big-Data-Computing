Vaccination can offer the most effective way with a long-term strategy to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 (Hu et al., 2021) . Towards this effort, several manufacturers have proposed different vaccine designs against SARS-CoV-2 (Creech et al., 2021) . Specifically, the novel mRNA-based vaccines provide significant efficacy and stability for some time (Le et al., 2020; Pardi et al., 2020) . The spike protein is one of the essential structural proteins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which includes two subunits to regulate receptor binding and membrane fusion, respectively (Huang et al., 2020) . SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells through receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) using its two spike protein subunits (Wheeler et al., 2021) . Because of that, improving antibody responses to the spike protein becomes the primary research direction of current vaccine development, and researchers put less effort into following up with the T cell immunity (Saini et al., 2021) . However, Diao et al. (2020) found that COVID-19 patients, especially patients who needed Intensive Care Unit (ICU) care, had significantly fewer CD4 + and CD8 + T cells than healthy people. Thus, understanding the mechanism of T cell responses to SARS-CoV-2 can provide additional knowledge on vaccine design (Grifoni et al., 2020) .",

            "text": "Different expressions of the cell-surface receptors CD4 and CD8 indicate that T cells have different types, including CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells (Jarjour et al., 2021) . CD4 + T cells play a crucial \"helper\" role in regulating anti-viral immune responses through the secretion of specific cytokines, whereas CD8 + T cells are \"killers\" that aim to directly attack and kill the pathogeninfected cells (Luckheeram et al., 2012; Tay et al., 2020; Jarjour et al., 2021) . In this study, we analyzed the single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data of both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells through some downstream analyses, including differential expression analysis of the genes, network analysis to detect gene co-expression networks, and deep learning to classify the samples with different disease states. In addition to T cells, B cells are also engaged in the battle with the SARS-CoV-2 virus by mediating partial immunological memory (Quast and Tarlinton, 2021) . Several studies have shown the appearance of B cells after the onset of symptoms of the mild COVID-19 (Hoehn et al., 2021; Rodda et al., 2021) . Moreover, the longitudinal study of the bulk level RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data is also valuable to discover the evolution of the disease. Recent studies found that the COVID-19 patients gradually developed symptoms and needed several weeks or months to recover after the infection (Nehme et al., 2021; Petersen et al., 2021) . Thus, we included two additional datasets, i.e., longitudinal blood samples using bulk level RNA-seq data and B cells at the single-cell level, to enrich our study. The overall goal of our study is to enhance the insight of gene expression associated with CD4 + and CD8 + T cells along with B cells, and provide some potential genes associated with the immune responses of the patients at different stages of SARS-CoV-2.",

We repeated the random selections 100 times to eliminate the potential bias due to unbalanced data. In each iteration, we implemented the differential expression analysis between two groups using MAST (Finak et al., 2015) , a two-part hurdle model. The first part of this model is a logistic regression model to account for the gene expression rate, and the second part is a linear model with the normal distribution assumption for the expression level, conditioning on a cell expressing the gene. We declared a gene differentially expressed (DE) if it was selected as DE gene in all the 100 rounds with the |log 2 FC| > 0.25 and the false discovery rate (FDR) adjusted p-value (q-value) < 0.05, where FC is the fold change that measures the amount of changes of the expression value of a gene between two groups.",

To avoid the uncertainty of its estimation, we applied the partial information decomposition and context (PIDC) algorithm (Chan et al., 2017) to study the gene-gene associations among the DE genes. And then, we built gene co-expression networks based on partial information decomposition (PID) for the healthy donors, the mild COVID-19 patients, and the severe COVID-19 patients, respectively.

In other words, the number of independent training sets (or their corresponding test sets) is identical to the number of patients. By dividing the dataset in this way, we aimed to investigate if the cell disease states of one patient could be predicted by cells from the remaining patients. Secondly, we implemented 5-folds cross-validation on each training set for parameter tuning. In this way, we can optimize the MLP models and use them to predict the corresponding test sets. Specifically, we fitted MLP models with the combinations of two optimizers, including adaptive moment estimation (Adam) (Kingma and Ba, 2017) and root mean square propagation (Rmsprop) (Tieleman and Hinton, 2012) , and different group weights, i.e., using weight and not using weight.

We also conducted the differential expression analysis for B cells with only healthy and mild groups included. Figure 2 displays the Venn diagrams of these comparisons. As we can see, there are more DE genes detected in the mild vs healthy comparison than the severe vs mild comparison. It is worth noting that the number of DE genes between the mild and the severe groups from CD8 + T cells is much lower than any other comparisons. Additionally, in the comparison of the mild and the healthy groups, although the number of DE genes from CD8 + T cells is lower than both CD4 + T cells and B cells, there are still 36 shared DE genes from all 3 cell types. The detailed DE genes list can be found in the Supplementary Material. Interestingly, the 33 shared DE genes in CD4 + T cells comparisons and the 19 shared DE genes in CD8 + T cells comparisons do not overlap. It could be due to the various functions and corresponding encoding genes CD4 + and CD8 + T cells express. Although, we detected DE genes using the under-sampling method, it is still important to know the original distributions of the expression levels of these genes. Since the differential expression analysis was based on the 100 balanced datasets, we used the average q-values across 100 analyses. However, we used the original fold changes of the DE genes to draw the volcano plots. In Figure 3 , we annotated the shared DE genes among three comparisons. Although the original fold changes of some DE genes do not reach the threshold we set (|log 2 FC| > 0.25), most of the shared DE genes have met this criterion, especially for the comparisons between COVID-19 patients and healthy donors. Moreover, most of the shared DE genes of mild vs healthy across CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, and B cells display significant differences based on the original unbalanced data (Supplementary Figure S1 ).",

However, we stacked the predicted results from all test sets to obtain the overall accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). According to Table 1 , the corresponding DE genes can distinguish the COVID-19 patients (mild or severe) from healthy donors using CD4 + T cells, CD8 + T cells, or B cells. However, it is difficult to classify the mild and severe COVID-19 patients based on CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells. On the other hand, we found a worse prediction in CD8 + T cells than in CD4 + T cells for the comparisons between the severe and mild groups. It could be due to the fewer DE genes detected in this comparison of CD8 + T cells. In summary, MLP models can efficiently distinguish the healthy people and the COVID-19 (mild or severe) patients using their corresponding DE genes.",

Based on these DE genes, we built a network for each group. We set the minimum module size of the network as 5 for both cell types. Due to various number of DE genes included in networks of different cell types, we set different minimum accepted edge weights (0.999 for CD4 + T cells and 0.997 for CD8 + T cells). These settings result in 130 and 156 DE genes included in the CD4 + and CD8+T cells networks, respectively. Figure 4 and Figure 5 show the networks in different disease states for CD4 + T cells and CD8 + T cells, respectively. In both cell types, we can see that the number of modules decreases in the order of healthy, mild COVID-19, and severe COVID-19. In other words, the connectivity of genes increases with the progression of the disease. This phenomenon has been noticed in many previous studies as well (Feldman et al., 2008; Gill et al., 2010) . As seen in Figure 4 , there is remarkable heterogeneity of the connectivity across the three networks of CD4 + T cells. Module 1 of the healthy network has been divided into two parts in the mild network. One part connects module 2 of the healthy network to form module 1 of the mild network, and another part connects module 5 of the healthy network to form module 3 of the mild network. And finally, all these modules link together to be a large module in the severe network. In contrast, the networks of CD8 + T cells seem to be more stable. This property suggests that the functions encoded by genes from CD4 + T cells are more varied in different disease states than CD8 + T cells.",

However, its connectivities are only significantly different between the mild and the severe COVID-19 network. Its average expression level in the severe group is significantly higher than in the mild group. According to the Entrez Gene database (Maglott et al., 2010) , TNF encodes a multifunctional proinflammatory cytokine related to multiple biological processes and diseases. Schett et al. (2020) discovered that targeting TNF is crucial for the inflammatory response instead of viral clearance in the cytokine pathogenesis of COVID-19. CCL4 and XCL1 are the hub genes in both the mild and severe networks. CCL4 is significantly differentially connected between any pairwise comparisons among the three networks. It is also the DE gene across three disease states. On the other hand, the expression levels and connectivities of XCL1 are both significantly different in comparing the healthy group and the COVID-19 group (either mild or severe). Actually, CCL4 and XCL1 are both related to chemokines and inflammatory responses (Maglott et al., 2010) . Meckiff et al. (2020) also suggested that CCL4 and XCL1 are likely to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19. In addition, GBP1, GBP4, and GBP5 always connect with each other in all three networks of CD4 + T cells. However, the number of genes associated with them decreases as the disease gets worse as shown in Figure 4 . They are all responsible for encoding guanylate binding protein (Stelzer et al., 2016) . Among these three genes, GBP4 and GBP5 are DE genes in the longitudinal bulk RNA-seq data (McClain et al., 2021) . Figure 6 shows the changes of them in gene expression over time from the corresponding dataset. These two genes have higher expression levels for healthy donors and patients in the early stage of COVID-19 and show a significantly decreasing trend as time goes by (especially a significant drop at the middle stage). Interestingly, their expression levels in the healthy group are significantly lower than the disease group according to the CD4 + T cells data at the single-cell level. Since the longitudinal blood sample data in Figure 6 is at the bulk level, other elements different from CD4 + T cells may exist to make the expression level for disease patients lower than healthy donors. In particular, the expression levels of GBP5 from CD8 + T cells in the disease group are significantly lower than in the healthy group.",

Module 2 of the healthy network shows a crucial cluster for cellular activation and is associated with the cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction pathway. In contrast, these functions are partially displayed by genes in module 1 of the mild network only. Genes in module 4 of the healthy network and module 2 of the mild network contribute to the functions that can provide immune responses, specifically responding to IFN-\u03b3. These genes are contained in the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway as well. The functions in module 6 of the healthy network and module 4 of the mild COVID-19 network are less critical due to the fewer genes included in these modules, but they are associated with some pathways in cancer. Since the only module in the severe network is the combination of modules from the healthy or mild network, it contains the most functions expressed in the other two networks. Furthermore, the connectivity of genes in module 4 of the healthy network from CD4 + T cells gradually decreases with the progression of COVID-19 ( Figure 4) . Those genes are associated with several immune responses, as we discussed above. In other words, the strength of collected immune activities of these genes from CD4 + T cells may be lower and lower with the development of COVID-19.",

We found that the number of DE genes between the healthy and mild groups is more than between the mild and severe groups. It indicates that the genes are expressed much differently between healthy individuals and COVID-19 groups of patients irrespective of their mild or severe disease status. In particular, we found that the average absolute value of log 2 FC across the corresponding DE genes for the severe vs mild comparison is significantly smaller than the average value for the disease vs healthy comparison. This general trend of the changes is similar to a previous study (Su et al., 2020) , which found a sharper difference of immune cells between mild and moderate cases than between moderate and severe cases. The results of MLP models also validate this finding in terms of classification of samples.
