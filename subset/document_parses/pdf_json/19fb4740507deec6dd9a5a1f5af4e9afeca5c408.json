Assisted living (AL) is a type of long-term care setting for older adults who need supportive care but not ongoing nursing care and emphasizes a social model of care provision. Because AL is a type of long-term care, it has at times been referenced along with nursing homes in discussions related to COVID-19 but not recognized for its different care practices that pose unique challenges related to COVID-19; in that manner, it has largely been left out of the COVID-19 discourse, although \u223c812,000 older adults live in AL. To identify COVID-19 issues specific to AL, stakeholders with expertise in AL operations, policy, practice, and research (n = 42) were recruited to participate in remote interviews between July and September 2020. Using a thematic analysis, we derived the following overarching themes: (1) Policymakers are disconnected from and lack an understanding of the AL context; (2) AL administrators were left to coordinate, communicate, and implement constantly changing guidelines with little support; (3) AL organizations faced limited knowledge of and disparate access to funding and resources; (4) state-level regulatory requirements conflicted with COVID-19 guidelines resulting in uncertainty about which rules to follow; and (5) AL operators struggled to balance public health priorities with promoting their residents' quality of life and well-being. To develop evidence-informed policy and avoid unintended consequences, AL operators, direct care workers, residents, and clinicians practicing in these settings should have opportunities to provide feedback throughout the policy development process, both state and national.",

Broadly, long-term care settings include nursing homes (NHs), care homes, assisted living and residential care (hereafter assisted living/residential care referred to as AL). As of September 2020, of the estimated 82,105 COVID-19-related deaths in long-term care settings, 30% were linked to AL residents (2) . Another recent study reported that one in five AL residents who tested positive for COVID-19 died, compared with a rate of 1 in 40 in the general U.S. population (3) . Approximately 28,900 AL settings provide care to \u223c812,000 residents across the country, and nearly one-quarter of residents have an average of four chronic conditions (4) . In addition, an estimated 42 to 72% of AL residents live with moderate/severe dementia or cognitive impairment (5) . Given that dementia is a risk factor for COVID-19 mortality (6, 7) and AL residents live in a long-term care environment, COVID-19 prevention and response in AL is an important topic. Our primary goal was to understand issues unique to AL related to pandemic response, lessons learned, and aspects of AL that make it easier or more difficult to implement infection control policies and practices. Second, we sought to inform future policy development and regulatory response to emergencies, disasters, and other largescale events that may impact AL. In this study, we learned from the lived experience of various stakeholders how the COVID-19 policy response materialized in and affected AL settings across the U.S.",

Generally, AL is a supportive living environment with a philosophy of social engagement, lack of national regulations, high prevalence of dementia, limited medical and nursing provider presence and direct care staff training, and a reliance on family members to supplement care (10) . AL residents vary regarding their care needs; some residents may be fairly independent, whereas others receive assistance with multiple activities of daily living and chronic health conditions (11) . AL settings can provide different levels of care based on residents' care needs in addition to housing and services to promote social engagement (12, 13) . Also, whereas NHs are required to have licensed nurses available to provide skilled nursing care 24 h daily (9) , most states restrict the provision of skilled nursing services in AL but permit external health providers to provide nursing/medical care onsite (14) . One key difference is that AL is regulated at the state level, and therefore what is considered AL, the population AL serves, and requirements for care that ALs provide vary within and across states (15) . The wide variation between and within states in AL licensure types (14, 15) , populations, care, staffing, and resources greatly affect these communities' ability to respond to an ongoing, novel, global pandemic (16) .",

For example, the Centers for Disease Prevention and Control (CDC) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) issued COVID-19 guidelines pertaining to NHs and hospitals. Although the CDC added recommendations for AL communities to seek guidance from state and local officials, they continued to reference CMS' NH guidance as a resource for local officials (20) . Some COVID-19 related federal policies and recommendations may not be feasible in practice for AL settings because, as Dobbs and colleagues described, AL settings face unique challenges in implementing federal guidance compared with NHs (21) , largely due to their use of external healthcare and service providers to provide resident care (14) , lower staffing levels and licensed staff availability (9, 22, 23) , variable infection control requirements (24) , and (in)ability to isolate and cohort COVID-19 positive residents (25) .",

Individuals, organizations, and institutions are situated within social and political structures, meaning that context shapes AL residents' \"convoys of care, \" extending from AL residents, residents' families, care staff, and AL settings and influenced by local and state agencies and the federal government (35) (36) (37) . Figure 1 presents the different levels of policy and regulatory response to the COVID-19 pandemic, as they relate to AL within a socioecological model. The first two concentric, shaded circles represent the microlevel or AL residents and their informal and formal care networks who may be most impacted by AL specific, county, state, and federal policies related to COVID-19. Residents and their formal and informal care partners, including AL care staff and administrators, external service providers (e.g., hospice, physical therapy), healthcare providers, and residents' families provide care within the AL setting. Furthermore, the policies enacted on and within AL settings may promote or inhibit the interrelationships and dynamics between these individuals. The outer circles represent the multilevel layering of meso-level (e.g., AL organizations, community) and macro-level (e.g., federal, state/county) policies that impact residents, their families, AL staff, and external care providers.",

Identifying the different levels and mechanisms of regulatory decision-making related to the COVID-19 pandemic response in AL can provide insights and lessons learned for a more efficient, less burdensome response for state regulators, AL operators, staff, residents, and residents' families that may inform responses during a future event with such large-scale effects.",

As is common with this approach (38), we sought diverse perspectives about AL setting-level experiences and state and federal actions. Thus, we recruited stakeholders with expertise related to AL regulations, operations, dementia care, and geriatric clinical practice. We first conducted an internet search for individuals working at or in collaboration with senior housing professional organizations, state agencies that license AL settings, and those who conduct research and clinically practice in AL settings as initial participants for this study (n = 10). Based on these initial interviews, professional contacts of the co-authors, and through a combination of purposive and snowball sampling, we ultimately emailed 100 stakeholders to participate in a 30-45min virtual interview, and 43 agreed to do so. We conducted 41 interviews with 42 participants over telephone or Zoom between July and October 2020. One interview included two participants (denoted with the same interview ID and lowercase \"a\" and \"b\" to differentiate). One respondent had to withdraw from participating due to a scheduling conflict. Those who chose not to participate either did not have the time/capacity or did not respond to our requests. We continued purposeful recruitment of individuals to participate in interviews until we reached data saturation, determined by the authors through a reflexive process throughout data collection [see Analysis; (39) (40) (41) ].",

The first, second, and third authors (associate professor of public health and established expert in AL policy) met weekly to discuss interpretations of emerging patterns raised by participants via reflexive and annotated notetaking, which were used to guide analysis and determine when additional interviews did not yield novel codes or topics (39, 40, 43, 44) . Using applied thematic analysis (41, 45, 46) , we read the interview transcripts, developed codes, and categorized emergent themes with the underlying context of different levels of COVID-19 response (Figure 1 ). The purpose of this thematic analysis is to depict and describe the salient features captured within participants' narratives related to our focus on the multilevel nature of the regulatory response in these settings, rather than to quantify the frequency of topics raised (45) (46) (47) (48) . After reading each interview transcript, we applied codes based on the topics raised by participants and in response to our interview questions by hand and organized with Microsoft Excel. We coded text as relevant to policies, regulations, rules, restrictions, or guidelines connected to COVID-19 or infection control practices using codes that addressed resident experience, health service use, infection control, government agencies, state regulations, and AL policies and practices.",

I cannot imagine how these settings are dealing with this [pandemic].

State-level requirements for infection control practices provided basic, general guidance: \"When I was looking into it I went down the rabbit hole of seeing who is regulated and who isn't. I found 27 states mention infection prevention and when it comes to hiring staff they just sign a statement regarding adhering to universal precautions.

We couldn't have just 2-3 staff for COVID-positive residents. If [a resident] got sick, [we] put everyone on super isolation, which was about the most we could do.\" Theme 5: AL Operators Had to Negotiate a Balance of Public Health Priorities With Promoting Their Residents' Quality of Life and Well-Being AL operators discussed the negative effects of restrictions that prioritized mitigating the spread of coronavirus without considering long-term effects of social isolation for a vulnerable population, introducing consequences for residents: \"Residents would say \"It's not COVID that's going to kill me, I'm more afraid of dying of these restrictions than COVID.\" Some of the restrictions, [I] don't know if we're fully taking a public health perspective. Stopping COVID is important and we also need to look at the impact of isolation. State and county officials, [I] don't think they are at that point. They still have a risk mitigation, infection control perspective. As operators, who interact with residents and families every day, we see the impacts everyday more than investigators and epidemiologists. Regulations would benefit from a more whole person perspective during COVID (AL operator, #19).\" With many states and AL settings restricting visitation, mitigating the consequences of social isolation and finding creative ways to keep residents engaged presented additional adversity, especially for people living with dementia. An operator of a Mississippi continuing care retirement community (#32) shared, \"Isolation is different in memory care, can't get them to wear masks, hard with a small place and progression of disease. [ We are] more liberal with them around their neighborhood. Window visits are difficult since it's such a high touch population. One resident didn't recognize her daughter. We could see how they lost that part of the connection with her daughter not being able to see her.\" From a policy and practice perspective, government entities and AL settings struggled to balance public health priorities and the physical and mental health consequences of restricting access to families and visitors for older adults living with cognitive impairment. One clinician trained in geriatric psychiatry commented, \"I've become really acutely aware of how bad the isolation has become and disruptive to routine. What I haven't seen yet nationally is any guidance on finding a happy medium. [...] Quarantine has long term mental health effects on people. We know this from other pandemics. I feel an urgency headed toward winter. Need some guidance around allowing family visits and restarting activities in a safe way. You cannot keep people locked in their rooms for months.

We've implemented Zoom for residents and families. Mostly for the families to check-in on us. Residents don't care about it.

Participants discussed how this pandemic exposed infrastructure limitations and introduced new policy and practice paradoxes (49) , resulting in a situation when two or more statements seem to be contradictory. At their inception, AL communities were designed to provide a social model for older residents who need support with activities of daily living and other services, as an alternative to the medicalized model associated with NHs and hospitals (12) . Stakeholders described how the pandemic exposed gaps in states' regulations that buttress social and emotional support to residents when medical responses, such as PPE use, isolation, and quarantine, were necessary.",

As noted by one stakeholder, state AL regulations might be vague, using the word \"may\" rather than \"must, \" which they interpreted as allowing AL providers great flexibility. From a policy perspective, states may intentionally create flexible policies by using vague language, although lack of regulatory specificity might also reflect inattention or oversight of a policy topic (50, 51) . Some might see vague, non-prescriptive regulations, made more evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, as a reason for federal oversight and increased regulatory requirements in AL (52) . However, developing and implementing federal practices and policies for AL communities is complex, political, and not universally endorsed. Among other reasons, proponents have argued that federal regulation would limit the diversity of AL that is fundamental to its model (53) . Medicaid reimbursement in community-based care is one example that highlights the complicated nature of federal oversight of AL. State Medicaid agencies have eligibility guidelines that define who may receive Medicaid-funded services in AL, and state licensing agencies maintain oversight (54) . Although CMS is a federal agency, they do not directly enforce or oversee rule compliance with AL communities that receive Medicaid dollars (55) .",

Care transitions from ALs to hospital settings and other healthcare entities can create confusion and complications for administrators and residents, regardless of an active pandemic. In addition to practical and logistic ambiguity, many state regulations do not offer specific directives for these types of care transitions (14) . However, some states explicitly restrict admission to prospective residents who have been exposed to infectious diseases. For example, Maryland's AL program regulations state: \"An AL program may not provide services to individuals who at the time of initial admission, as established by the initial assessment, would require: Treatment for a disease or condition which requires more than contact isolation\" (56) . Throughout the pandemic, AL communities received mixed messages from regulators about the safety and capacity of hospitals and emergency departments (57) . Participants described confusion as to whether or not to immediately discharge residents who tested positive for COVID-19 to hospitals. Transitioning residents back to their AL was further complicated by admission criteria (e.g., inability to admit residents with skilled nursing needs) and testing protocols. AL administrative participants expressed the desire to provide end-of-life care and testing to residents within AL settings, yet felt bound by regulatory complexity and contradictions.",

Particularly, policymakers at all levels should be aware of including AL perspectives in AL policy development processes and the impact of intentional collaboration across levels of governance while balancing public health goals with quality of life and well-being for all residents. These contexts have implications for the scope of services provided to residents under the purview of AL and, therefore, their ability to respond to blanket guidelines extended to licensed health settings, including NHs. Federal requirements for AL communities to procure PPE neglected to understand the ways in which AL funding varies from NHs-namely that AL communities have different, if any, access to federal funding or financial reserves for that kind of necessity. Although AL is largely a private-pay industry, none have sufficient reserves for the financial burdens exacted by COVID-19. Investigating both success and failures of response to COVID-19 provides a learning opportunity for political, regulatory, and long-term care systems to develop mechanisms that increase collaboration and communication across sectors (28) .",

This study is limited by stakeholders recounting their experiences with AL policy responses, retrospectively and concurrently, in that the pandemic has not ended and policy responses remain dynamic and ongoing. It is possible that between the time of this writing and when stakeholders shared their experiences, federal, state, and/or local regulatory response to COVID-19 related to AL changed in significant ways. For example, in September 2020 (the end of the data collection period), the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced private pay AL settings qualified for funds appropriated by the CARES act, expanding access to federal support (58) . The field may benefit from a more focused, longitudinal analysis examining policy approaches during the beginning of the pandemic and the extent to which federal and state governments addressed policy contradictions for AL over time. Additionally, the racial and ethnic disparities of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality seen in the community are mirrored in long-term care populations (59, 60) . There is a need for more inclusion and centering of the experiences of AL residents, staff, and operators, including older adults coded as racial or ethnic minorities or who are members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender community who have experienced systemic exclusion from these spaces. Lastly, although we recruited multilevel stakeholders for this study, our participants did not include direct care staff nor residents currently living in AL or their family members. It is possible that frontline care staff, residents, and residents' families might have different perspectives than those raised by the stakeholders in this study. Inclusion of resident, family, and direct care staff perspectives would have provided an additional layer to this contextual analysis of the individual and interpersonal impact and strengthened our study overall.",
