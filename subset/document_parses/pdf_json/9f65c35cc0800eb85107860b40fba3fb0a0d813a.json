Because the prognosis of CRC primarily depends on the tumor stage, early detection plays a decisive role in the treatment and prognosis of CRC patients (Messersmith, 2019) . However, a large number of patients are still diagnosed at progressive stages, and the 5-years survival rate is only approximately 30%, even after standardized systemic treatment (Siegel et al., 2020) . Increasing evidence has confirmed that T2DM patients face an enhanced threat of suffering from CRC compared to a population without the disease (Larsson et al., 2005; Elwing et al., 2006; Yu et al., 2016) . Therefore, the T2DM population should be regarded as a high-risk population prone to CRC, and convenient and effective screening strategies for CRC should be developed for the T2DM population to increase the detection rate of CRC and improve the prognosis of these patients.",

To redistribute the specimens based on similarities in the patterns of serum protein levels, we conducted a hierarchical cluster analysis of the 67 DAPs according to previous research (Huang et al., 2010; Yang et al., 2021) . Cluster analysis revealed a clear separation of the four groups ( Figure 2D ). Next, three protein subgroups from the afore mentioned analysis (T2DM vs healthy participant, CRC vs healthy participant and T2DM + CRC vs healthy participant) were differentiated to identify a subgroup of proteins that were differentially expressed only in the T2DM + CRC group. In total, eight distinct proteins were regarded as specific candidates in patients with T2DM + CRC ( Figures 3A-I) .

They pointed out that T2DM was correlated remarkably with an enhanced threat of developing CRC.

Apart from this, metformin having the ability to mediate alterations to multiple critical events, including CRC cell proliferation, stemness maintenance, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and transformational protumor cellular metabolic conditions (Jaromy and Miller, 2021) . Moreover, CRC patients with T2DM receiving medical treatment with metformin experienced fewer distant metastases, associated with slower progression of CRC (Powell et al., 2020) . A retrospective study pointed out that patients in the T2DM + CRC group were older than those in the T2DM group in a randomly selected cohort, which was consistent with our research (Feng et al., 2020) .

The risk of T2DM patients developing CRC is significantly increased, and regular screening should be carried as they are a high-risk group. The latest research pointed out that through colonoscopy, the detection rate of colonic adenoma in T2DM patients was notably higher than that of the general population (Ottaviano et al., 2020) . Although colonoscopy and other invasive screening modalities are generally regarded as safe, the threats of bowel preparation, the procedure, and sedation medications are all enhanced in older patients (Nee et al., 2020) . In addition, colonoscopies are very difficult to carry out, especially in primary hospitals, due to the high technical requirements of staff, low patient acceptance, and high medical costs. Therefore, it is very important to find noninvasive diagnostic methods, especially serum biomarkers, to accurately identify CRC in T2DM patients.",

We identified a subgroup of proteins that were differentially expressed specifically in the T2DM + CRC group. A total of eight precise proteins were found to be specific to T2DM + CRC patients. In addition, the levels of four candidate proteins were prominently different between the T2DM + CRC and T2DM groups, and PZP exhibited the largest difference.

PZP has been identified as an unprecedented noninvasive indicator for screening lung adenocarcinoma in T2DM in our previous research . Furthermore, several tumor biomarkers already in clinical use also exhibited valuable discriminatory activity in screening CRC, the combination of PZP, CA199 and CEA exhibited encouraging diagnostic value, and the AUC reached 0.916.",

Namely, these nine proteins shared between the T2DM-CRC and CRC groups may be effective biomarkers for CRC regardless of diagnosing with T2DM or not. As shown in Supplementary Figure S4 , we could found that FUBP1/2, PON3 and FHR1 were increased in general CRC (CRC and T2DM + CRC) patients compared with non-CRC patients (NC + T2DM), while KV104 and FRPD2 were decreased (Supplementary Figure  S4) . Recent research reported that FUBP1 promoted CRC stemness and metastasis by activating Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (Yin et al., 2021) . Whether increased FUBP1 was derived from tumor tissues and whether FUBP1 could be potential biomarker for CRC diagnosis needed to be further studied.",

The patients diagnosed with T2DM + CRC are not common in our hospital but could not be ignored on a larger scale. Thus, multi-centric observational studies with a larger sample size should be conducted before PZP could be applied in clinical practice. Besides, in our previous research, PZP was identified as a serum indicator for screening lung adenocarcinoma in T2DM. We also compared the serum level of PZP in T2DM, T2MD + CRC and T2DM with lung adenocarcinoma (T2MD + LAC) patients, and the results showed that PZP was increased in T2MD + CRC and T2MD + LAC patients, but no difference was observed in these two groups (Supplementary Figure S3) . Thus, whether PZP is a pan-cancer or pan-adenocarcinoma biomarker in T2DM needs to be further explored.",
