A number of drugs are metabolized by the liver during phase 1 and 2 reactions which include complex processes involving cytochrome P450 enzymes. Genetic and acquired variability in cytochrome P450 activity may have profound effects on pharmacokinetics. Additionally, drugs can also modify how the liver functions and cause dysfunction or even failure of the organ both by a direct effect on the liver or by alteration in liver blood flow. It is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of liver failure in patients and identify possible causes including drug interactions. Furthermore, once a patient has been recognized to be suffering with liver dysfunction or failure drug choice and dosing regime will need to be rationalized.",

Their importance can be seen in certain subgroups that lack particular genes. An example pertinent to anaesthesia is deficiency in CYP2D6 which metabolises codeine to morphine, these patients therefore find codeine ineffective. Conversely there is a small subgroup of people of Saudi Arabian and Ethiopian decent with very high expression of 2D6 who metabolize codeine into vast amounts of morphine. Refer to Table 2 for more details. An individual more detailed breakdown of CYP450 genes is beyond the scope of this article. Some drugs can induce or inhibit CYP450 enzymes which have the sequential effect on the metabolism of other drugs, either increasing or reducing it respectively. Possibly the most important example is CYP3A4 which metabolises many substrates and is induced by rifampicin, carbamazepine, phenytonin and dexamethasone. Of interest to anaesthesia this will increase metabolism of opioids, benzodiazepines and local anaesthetics. Another well cited example is the increased metabolism of the oral contraceptive pill and its reduction in efficacy.

Hepatic dysfunction can cause fluid retention and will increase the volume within which drugs are present, particularly those which usually remain in the plasma, thus increasing their volume of distribution and reducing their plasma concentration. 2 In liver disease, protein synthesis may be reduced. These proteins are important as binding sites for drugs and as such alter the amount of free drug available, volume of distribution, half life and duration of action. An important example is albumin. Hypo-albuminaemia will increase the proportion of free drug which is active, therefore doses of highly protein bound drugs may need to be reduced, for example phenytoin and benzodiazepines, aspirin and warfarin. 8 Another protein produced by the liver, a 1 acid glycoprotein binds basic drugs such as carbamazepine, propanolol, alprenolol and imipramine as well as steroids. Bilirubin can also compete for protein binding sites, so raised levels can increase amount of free drugs, the effect however is less in vivo than in vitro. 1",

The risk is related to the generation of trifluroacteyl chloride (TFA) by metabolism of agents, which is implicated in toxicity 12 Around 20% of administered dose of halothane is metabolized by the liver, more specifically by cytochrome P450. This is a relatively high percentage when compared to more modern inhalational agents, for example, 0.2% isoflurane, 0.02% desflurane and 3% sevoflurane. even though sevoflurane undergoes 3% metabolism it does not generate TFA and hence is not linked to immune mediated injury 13 Sevoflurane metabolism produces fluoride which is not linked to hepatotoxicity. 14 Inhalational agents themselves cause a dose dependent reduction in hepatic blood flow (HBF). Isoflurane and sevoflurane result in relatively lower reduction in HBF at 1 MAC as compared to Desflurane. 15 As long as hypotension is avoided and above effects are kept in mind Desflurane is probably the safest choice of inhalational agent due to its' low rate of metabolism and rapid and predictable emergence from anaesthesia. 13 There are two types of halothane hepatitis. Type 1 which is mild, transient and has a relatively high incidence (25e30%). Type 2 caused by oxidative metabolism of halothane in the liver leading to fever, jaundice, and dramatically elevated serum transaminases. The compounds synthesized by oxidation then bind to trifluoroacetylate proteins in the hepatic endoplasmic reticulum causing cellular dysfunction, it is thought to occur in genetically predisposed individuals.",

In clinical practice a standard induction dose need not be altered. However they should be titrated slowly to effect. There are no current recommendations on the use of TIVA (Total Intravenous Anaesthesia) in patients with liver disease. Research is sparse and conflicting. Some earlier reports suggested that inhalational anaesthesia results in smaller elevation of liver enzymes than TIVA with Propofol-Fentanyl. 16 A more recent study however suggested slightly lower rate of elevation in LFT after using TIVA. 17 Opiates Morphine is metabolized by the liver to active metabolite morphine-6-glucoronide which has potent analgesic properties, and morphine-3-glucuronide, which has no analgesic properties but has adverse neurotoxic side effects such as confusion and respiratory depression. As both metabolites are excreted renally, they accumulate in renal failure. In liver failure morphine itself may accumulate as extraction ratio is reduced thereby enhancing further the effect of morphine. 13 Therefore dose of morphine should be reduced. The same is true of fentanyl and alfentanil dose, as although there is no active metabolite they also rely on hepatic metabolism. Remifentanil may be good choice as its metabolism is by plasma esterases and it has no active metabolites. A review of pain management in patients with liver disease by the American Association for Study of Liver Diseases (AALSD) in 2018 states in general most opioids have prolonged half life. Their recommendations include increase the dosing intervals (6e12hr) and using immediate release preparations over extended release 18 In July 2013 the Medicine and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) produced a drug safety update that restricted the use of codeine in children. 19 This was prompted by case reports of four children suffered serious harm following the administration of codeine in the immediate post-operative period. Codeine should only be used to relieve acute moderate pain in children older than 12 years and only if it cannot be relieved by other painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen alone.",

It is primarily metabolized in the liver and may have a prolonged half-life in patients with liver disease.

Normal pathways of metabolism are saturated and hepatic glutathione stores are exhausted. Patients are often initially asymptomatic for the first 24 h before reporting nausea, vomiting, right upper quadrant pain with progressive derangement of liver function tests (LFTs) after 18 h. The MHRA produced new guidelines for treatment of paracetamol overdose in 2012; the changes included an updated nomogram and a simplified treatment schedule. 25 The administration of acetylcysteine has previously been based on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram, which divided treatment groups into high and low risk. The dose was then calculated on a weight-based table, which increased the risk of drug error. The updated nomogram has a single treatment line (Figure 1) 25 ; thereby eliminating the need for assessing whether the patient falls into the high-risk category. It also advises that in cases of staggered overdoses there should be no delay in the administration of acetylcysteine. Another cause for concern was the adverse events that had been reported following the bolus dose of acetylcysteine, this has been addressed by increasing the duration over which it is infused, from 15 min to 60 min.",
