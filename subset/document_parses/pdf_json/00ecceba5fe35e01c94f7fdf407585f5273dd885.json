            "text": "Hyperactive and damaging inflammation is a hallmark of severe rather than mild Coronavirus disease 2019 . To uncover key inflammatory differentiators between severe and mild COVID-19, we applied an unbiased single-cell transcriptomic analysis. We integrated two single-cell RNA-seq datasets with COVID-19 patient samples, one that sequenced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells and one that sequenced peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The combined cell population was then analyzed with a focus on genes associated with disease severity. The immunomodulatory long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) NEAT1 and MALAT1 were highly differentially expressed between mild and severe patients in multiple cell types. Within those same cell types, the concurrent detection of other severity-associated genes involved in cellular stress response and apoptosis regulation suggests that the pro-inflammatory functions of these lncRNAs may foster cell stress and damage. Thus, NEAT1 and MALAT1 are potential components of immune dysregulation in COVID-19 that may provide targets for severity related diagnostic measures or therapy.",

Symptoms and progression of COVID-19 vary widely [3] , as some patients may be asymptomatic while others exhibit disease with varying severity [4, 5] . Common symptoms include fever, cough and fatigue that generally appear 2 to 14 days after exposure [6, 7] . Rarer symptoms include dyspnea, headache/dizziness, nausea, diarrhea and hemoptysis [8] . Severe that can lead to multiorgan damage and death [9] . The mechanisms that separate mild and severe disease remain poorly understood. After viral exposure, the inflammatory response to COVID-19 commences with signaling cascades that lead to the secretion of type I interferons, cytokines and chemokines [10] . This initial exposure also activates inflammasomes, multimeric protein complexes that play an important role in triggering inflammation and the subsequent initiation of an adaptive immune response [11] [12] [13] . One such inflammasome is the Nod-like receptor pyrin domaincontaining 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome, which is a major cause of cytokine storm associated with clinical manifestations of severe COVID-19 disease [14] . Coronavirus viroporin proteins can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome which subsequently regulates the secretion of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 [15] . Pyroptosis, a programmed cell death pathway, that leads to immune cell depletion, is also regulated by activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and is an important mechanism of viral pathogenesis in both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV [16] [17] [18] . These studies suggest that investigation of inflammasome regulation may elucidate understanding of COVID-19 disease pathophysiology.",

Of particular interest are the lncRNAs NEAT1 and MALAT1, which have clinical relevance in multiple inflammatory disorders. NEAT1 is a potent activator of inflammasomes, particularly within macrophages [20] . Inflammatory models of several diseases including atherosclerosis, irritable bowel disease, diabetic nephropathy, and sepsis indicate that NEAT1 is a driver of inflammation and pyroptosis, identifying it as a potential target for anti-inflammatory therapy [21] [22] [23] [24] . MALAT1 is also a potent inflammatory regulator linked to similar inflammatory disorders [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . However, MALAT1 has a more nuanced inflammatory role than NEAT1 that includes immune regulatory and suppressive effects as a regulator in macrophages and T lymphocytes, as well as a source of negative feedback to the NF-\u03baB pathway [31, 32] . Furthermore, both NEAT1 and MALAT1 have been recently connected to COVID-19 related inflammation, emphasizing a need for additional study of these lncRNAs [33, 34] .",

However, it is challenging to directly compare results across studies in different tissues due to differences in cell cluster identification between physiological compartments. We postulated that simultaneous analysis of severe versus mild COVID-19 patients across respiratory and peripheral immune compartments using integrated clustering would uncover key effectors of immune dysregulation in the COVID-19 immune response. To achieve this goal, we integrated two single-cell datasets, one from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and one from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) [35, 36] , to examine disease transcriptomics across severities as well as between local and peripheral cellular environments. We utilized an unbiased analytical strategy that was agnostic to specific gene functions and focused on genes with severity-dependent expression across different cell types. Taken together, we uncovered genes contributing to the dysregulated COVID-19 immune response prominent in severe relative to mild disease. Moreover, we identified cell types where these inflammatory regulators manifest in local and peripheral compartments.",

These datasets were generated from patient samples collected between January and April of 2020. Patients who were mechanically ventilated or had PaO 2 /FiO 2 \ufffd 300 mmHg indicating hypoxemia consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [41] were designated as severe patients while all others were considered to have mild disease (S1 Table) . The BAL dataset contained three healthy controls while the PBMC dataset contained six (S2 Table) . Both datasets were preprocessed using the R program Seurat [42] . Briefly, cells were filtered to only include cells with unique molecular identifier (UMI) counts greater than 1000, gene count between 200 and 6000, and less than 10% of genes mapping to mitochondrial genes. The function SCTransform from the Seurat package was applied to each dataset separately to regress out technical variability as well as the percentage of mitochondrial gene expression [43] . Transformed BAL and PBMC datasets were integrated with 3000 integration features and 50 integration anchors as recommended in Seurat [44] . We found that the \"M3\" mild patient sample from the BAL dataset contained only 369 total cells, while every other patient sample contained at least 1200 cells. The M3 sample was removed before differential expression analysis to avoid skewing results due to extremely low cell counts.",

The clustering was visualized using uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) [45] . The raw integrated dataset was normalized by applying SCTransform to the full integrated dataset. This normalized count matrix is utilized for all subsequent analysis. Marker genes for each cluster were computed using the FindAllMarkers function with the Model-based Analysis of Single-cell Transcriptomics algorithm (MAST) for differential expression with UMI count as a latent variable [46, 47] . Cluster markers were then inspected and labeled according to known cell markers [48, 49] . A second round of clustering with a resolution of 1 was then conducted to further classify subtypes of identified cells. Clusters with fewer than 300 cells were reassigned to larger clusters using Seurat integration label transfer, yielding 27 clusters at this stage. Cluster identities were then scored and verified using a signature matrix generated from flow cytometry sorted RNA-seq data of immune cells to resolve ambiguities between clusters [50]. This resulted in the merging of two natural killer cell clusters, leaving 26 total clusters. Many of these clusters consisted of similar cell types with slight differences in effector genes. Thus, clusters of the same cell type were combined in a coarse identification level with 15 clusters. The original 26 clusters were renamed as numbered subclusters of the 15 main clusters. Plots of cell clusters and key cell type markers were generated using Seurat's plotting functions.",

Genes from each cell type that were differentially expressed across all three comparisons between healthy controls, mild, and severe patients were tallied. For BAL, only genes with FDR adjusted p-values less than 1e-7 across all comparisons were considered (17.4% of all DEGs in BAL), while PBMC DEGs were considered if all FDR adjusted p-values across comparisons for that gene were less than 0.05 (16.4% of all DEGs in PBMCs). The difference in p-value threshold was used to filter a similar proportion of genes from BAL and PBMC data due to the smaller number of DEGs detected in PBMCs (200-400 in PBMCs, 1000+ in BAL). These highly differentially expressed genes were further filtered by removing genes that were not differentially expressed across all conditions in at least 5 different cell types (1/3 of our total cell types).

This resulted in the removal of the 21 most variable genes. We termed the 50 remaining DEGs recurrent differentially expressed genes (rDEGs) since they were found in multiple cell types and showed differential expression between patients and healthy controls as well as between severities.

We generated 4 modules from the 50 rDEGs using the find_gene_modules function in Monocle 3 with 30 principle components and a resolution of 0.8 [52] [53] [54] . Differential module expression was calculated using ANOVA of aggregated module expression levels and processed with a Tukey posthoc test.

These clusters also expressed other pro-inflammatory factors such as S100A8, CCL2, CCL3, CCL7, and CCL8 [60, 61] . Three other MoMa clusters showed M2 polarization with increased FN1 expression along with decreased VCAN and FCN1 expression. These M2 MoMa clusters also expressed Th2 associated inflammatory factors such as MRC1 and CCL18 [61] . All MoMa clusters expressed FCGR3A (CD16a) [58] . Two additional clusters were labeled as intermediate MoMa because they did not show distinct transcriptomes corresponding to either M1 or M2 groups.

The ubiquity of NEAT1, its specific localization to BAL cells, and its pro-inflammatory functions suggests that it may be a key mediator of the inflammation seen in severe COVID-19. NEAT1 is a well characterized activator of the NLRP3 inflammasome, as well as the NLRC4 and AIM2 inflammasomes, which in turn amplify the inflammatory response [20] . However, an overactive immune response contributes to lasting tissue damage in severe COVID-19 disease. Intense inflammation through activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome can also lead to pyroptosis, driven by the upregulation of NEAT1 [20, 21] . These highly inflammatory and damaging effects of NEAT1 illustrate how overexpression in severe patients might lead to the inflammatory tissue damage seen in severe COVID-19.",

MALAT1 has been linked to M1-like activity in macrophages, promoting inflammation [77] . Our finding that MALAT1 is overexpressed in BAL MoMa of severe versus mild patients suggests that it might be involved in precipitating a shift towards M1 macrophages that exacerbates inflammation. This is further supported by our findings that severe patients show expansion of M1 macrophages and decrease of M2 and intermediate macrophages in BAL, while mild patients show decrease of M1 macrophages. Furthermore, MALAT1 was overexpressed in CD4+ T cells of mild patients. This is also reflective of MALAT1's protective role in T cells. Loss of MALAT1 expression has been shown to push T cells towards the inflammatory Th1 and Th17 phenotypes while also decreasing Treg differentiation [31] . This function matches our observed increase in abundance of Tregs in mild patients. Thus, the upregulation of MALAT1 in mild patients may be contributing to the more subdued immune response observed in these patients.",

NF-\u03baB is induced in COVID-19 infection [78] . Although we did not detect differential activity of NF-\u03baB directly, we found upregulation of its inhibitor NFKBIA in BAL of severe patients which suggests a feedback response to strong NF-\u03baB activity. NFKBIA's downregulation in PBMCs of severe patients may be due to localization of cells expressing NFKBIA to the site of infection in attempts to regulate the hyperactive inflammatory state [79] . The upregulation of BCL2A1 and MTRNR2L12 is also indicative of extensive cellular stress [80, 81] . While MTRNR2L12 is upregulated in both mild and severe disease, BCL2A1 is upregulated exclusively in severe disease. The increased activity of these anti-apoptotic genes, particularly in BAL of severe patients, shows additional evidence of the cellular stress induced by infection and inflammation. These genes may be responding to pyroptosis pathways triggered by inflammasome activation via NEAT1 and MALAT1. Further evidence of inflammatory cell damage is seen in the downregulation of NUPR1 in BAL of M1 and M2 macrophages of severe patients with upregulation in mild patients. Downregulation of this stress response gene has been shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS production that can lead to cell death [82] . Lastly, our observation that CTSL, a protein crucial for COVID-19 viral entry is upregulated across multiple cell types in severe patients provides a potential initial mechanism for the induction of the NEAT1 and MALAT1 mediated inflammatory state through increased efficiency of viral entry [72] . Recently, additional independent evidence and reviews have emerged highlighting expression of NEAT1 and MALAT1 in both in vitro and in vivo samples of COVID-19 infection [83] [84] [85] [86] . These additional studies provide further evidence that the patterns of lncRNA expression presented in this study are highly associated with COVID-19 related inflammation.",

Column headings include indicators for which conditions are being compared where applicable. The conditions are numbered: \"1 = healthy control\", \"2 = mild COVID-19 patient\", \"3 = severe COVID-19 patient\". For example, the prefix \"g2_1\" indicates the comparison of mild patient expression levels minus healthy control expression levels. Log-fold change is reported relative to the natural log. Columns labeled \"pct.1\", \"pct.2\", or \"pct.3\" indicate the percentage of cells in the condition corresponding to that number with detectable expression of a particular gene. (XLSX) S7 Table. rDEGs with their expression levels in each cell type where each rDEG's adjusted p-values passed the p-value filter as defined in our methods section. Column headings include indicators for which conditions are being compared where applicable. The conditions are numbered: \"1 = healthy control\", \"2 = mild COVID-19 patient\", \"3 = severe COVID-19 patient\". For example, the prefix \"g2_1\" indicates the comparison of mild patient expression levels minus healthy control expression levels. Log-fold change is reported relative to the natural log. Columns labeled \"pct.1\", \"pct.2\", or \"pct.3\" indicate the percentage of cells in the condition corresponding to that number with detectable expression of a particular gene. The \"celltype\" and \"sample\" columns indicate which cell type and which sample condition the rDEG passed filter in. (XLSX) S8 Table. Comparisons between rDEGs discussed in our results shows strong agreement in validation datasets. A/B. Tables representing the tally of differential expression results of our discussed rDEGs which agreed or disagreed between analysis and validation groups based on the direction of detected differential expression. Tables are split by BAL/nasopharyngeal and PBMC groups. The first three columns correspond to cases where a comparison is not available due to a lack of differential expression detected in the original analysis (na.orig), the validation set (na.val), or both (na.all). The top half of each table reports the results for severe versus mild cases only (SvsM) while the bottom half reports results for all three comparisons: healthy versus mild, healthy versus severe, and severe versus mild. (PDF) S9 Table. Per gene level validation tables for BAL and PBMC groups respectively. Each sheet name corresponds to the cell type presented. Row names indicate the gene being compared, and column names indicate the cohorts being compared: healthy (H), mild COVID (M), and severe COVID (S). When differential expression is detected in both the original analysis and validation, the column is labled \"agree\" if the change occurred in the same direction and \"disagree\" if it is opposite. Other labels indicate where a comparison is not available due to a lack of differential expression detected in the original analysis (na.orig), the validation set (na.val), or both (na.all). (XLSX) S10 Table. Per gene level validation tables for BAL and PBMC groups respectively. Each sheet name corresponds to the cell type presented. Row names indicate the gene being compared, and column names indicate the cohorts being compared: healthy (H), mild COVID (M), and severe COVID (S). When differential expression is detected in both the original analysis and validation, the column is labled \"agree\" if the change occurred in the same direction and \"disagree\" if it is opposite. Other labels indicate where a comparison is not available due to a lack of differential expression detected in the original analysis (na.orig), the validation set (na.val), or both (na.all). (XLSX) S1 File. Output of the sessionInfo() function in R showing packages loaded for this analysis along with all dependencies and operating system details. ( ",

Genes with the highest residual variance are nearly all immunoglobulin and ribosome genes. B. Plot of 100 genes with highest residual variance in descending order. The rate of variance decrease stabilizes after the 21 st gene. C. Table of top 21 genes filtered out of downstream analysis due to very high residual variance. (BMP) S2 Fig. Unbiased clustering of combined BAL and PBMC data reveals common cell types between cohorts and sample conditions. A/B. Uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP p)lots showing the distribution of all cells in both cohorts within defined cell types. Plot A shows the 15 major cell groups we identified with labels over the cluster centers. Plot B shows the subclusters making up those groups. The major groups are abbreviated as prefixes with a letter suffix indicating subgroup. M1, M2 and Int are the macrophage/monocytes. NK is natural killer cells, E/G is epithelial cells and granulocytes, and E/P/C is epithelia, pneumocyte, and ciliary cells. C. Select markers for major cell groups plotted on the same UMAP projection. This illustrates the specificity of these markers for different regions of the plot corresponding to our respective cell types. D. Dot plot visualization of top markers utilized for identification of each cell cluster. The size of each dot indicates the percentage of cells with detectable expression of each gene, with color indicating expression level. E. Splitting the UMAP by cohort and by severity, with \"H\" indicating healthy control, \"M\" indicating mild disease, and \"S\" indicating severe disease illustrates that cell clusters do not organize according to sample type or patient condition, indicating successful integration of the datasets. (BMP) S3 Fig. Transferred cell identities correspond to original cell identities from the nasopharyngeal validation set. Dot plot shows cells from the nasopharyngeal validation dataset, identified by their transferred labels on the Y axis and their original labels on the X axis. Color of each dot indicates the numeric log frequency of cells that fit each corresponding set of labels. The size of each dot represents the percentage of each transferred cell types which is represented by each original cell type. From left to right, the full cell type names from the nasopharyngeal dataset are: non-resident macrophage (nrMa), monocyte-derived macrophage (MoD-Ma), monocyte-derived dendritic cell (moDC), resident macrophage (rMa), cytotoxic T cell (CTL), regulatory T cell (Treg), natural killer T cell (NKT), proliferating natural killer T cell (NKT-p), natural killer cells (NK), neutrophils (Neu), B cells, plasmacytoid dendritic cell (pDC), basal cell, ciliated cell, differentiating ciliated cell, FOXN4+ epithelial cell, ionocyte, interferon responsive cell (IRC), mast cell (MC), epithelial outliers, secretory, differentiating secretory, squamous, and unknown epithelial. (BMP) S4 Fig. Transferred cell identities correspond to original cell identities from the PBMC validation set. Dot plot shows cells from the PBMC validation set, identified by their transferred labels on the Y axis and their original labels on the X axis.
