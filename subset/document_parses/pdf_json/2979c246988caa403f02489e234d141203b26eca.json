            "text": "The enteropeptidase (EP) initiates the intestinal digestion by proteolytic processing of trypsinogen, generating catalytic active trypsin. The dysfunction of EP will cause a series of pancreatic diseases, the most severe of which is acute necrotizing pancreatitis. However, the molecular mechanism of EP activation and substrate recognition remain elusive due to the lack of structural information, hampering the structure-based research of EP and even further EP-targeted drug design. Here we report cryo-EM structures of human EP in multiple states, covering the functional cycle spanning from inactive to active state and eventually to the substrate binding state, with the inactive core region reached an atomic 2.7-\u00c5-resolution. The heavy chain of EP exhibits a clamping configuration with the CUB2 domain serving for substrate recognition. The N-terminus of light chain induces the surface loop remodeling from inactive to active conformation, resulting in a highly dynamic and active EP. Then the heavy chain performs like a hinge to ensure the flexibility of light chain for substrate recruitment and subsequent cleavage. Our study provides structural insights of EP remodeling and heavy chain dynamics while performing enzymatic function, facilitating our understanding of the pathogenies of EP-related pancreatitis and the EPtargeted treatment of pancreatitis.",

Activated EP could stimulate the conversion of pancreatic trypsinogen to trypsin, via cleavage of the specific trypsinogen activated peptide (Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-Lys, DDDDK), which is highly conserved in vertebrates [4] [5] [6] . Hereafter, trypsin initiates a cascade of activation of various pancreatic zymogens, such as chymotrypsinogen, proelastase, procarboxypeptidase and prolipase, to regulate nutrient absorption and metabolism 2, [7] [8] [9] [10] . The dysfunction of EP will cause a series of diseases. Newborns with congenital deficiency of EP will need pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy or be treated with a mixture of amino acids in the diet to promote growth and normal health, suggesting the pivotal role of EP in regulating body homeostasis 1, [11] [12] [13] [14] . On the other hand, EP redundancy will also cause diseases.",

One EP structure with bound inhibitor elucidates the inhibition mechanism of EP light chain by camostat 10 . However, the inhibitor specificity of EP mainly depends on the heavy chain 24 . Another structure of EP light chain in complex with the substrate peptide was also solved, however, the proteolytic activity toward trypsinogen is significantly impaired with deletion of the heavy chain 2, 4, 6, 30, 33 . Consequently, there is still a huge gap in the understanding of EP functional mechanism due to the lack of structural information on heavy chain.

The map displays the orientation of the remaining three domains (LDLR, CUB and MAM, LCM for short) with a few details ( Fig. 1B-C) . These domains show fuzzy density without structural features from the 2D class averages, suggesting their mobility relative to the core region (Fig. S1E ). To further confirm the orientation of these domains, we searched the AlphaFold Protein Structure Database for the fulllength EP model (Jumper et al., 2021; Tunyasuvunakool et al., 2021) . The predicted full-length structure depicts a scenario that the light chain is deeply enclosed by heavy chain in EP precursor (Fig. S2D) . Fitting the predicted model into our inactive EP map, the core domain matches perfectly with our electron density, and the RMSD between the predicted model and the experimental one is 0.935, demonstrating the reliability for the 3D structure predication of AlphaFold2 (Fig. S2D ). The predicted LCM domains extend in almost the same direction as the density we have resolved, except for a slightly shift of ~20 \u00c5 (Fig. S2E ).",

Two chains appearing as two bands on our SDS PAGE and the high protease activity indicate trypsin-treated EP is indeed in the active state ( Fig. S1A-B ). Though these two bands containing the complete length of expressed residues, only the core region density could be solved. We performed deep classification as that for inactive dataset, still, we could not find any trace for the previously low-resolution LCM domains ( Fig. S3C and S3F ). It suggested that these unresolved LCM domains are much more dynamic relative to the core region in the active state. Thus, we only solved this activated EP-core cryo-EM structure to an overall resolution of 3.2 \u00c5, allowing us to further explore the activation mechanism of hEP (Figs. 2A, S3, and Table 1 ). The overall shape of the activated EP-core is quite similar to that of the inactive core map, with the heavy chain clamps the catalytic light chain ( Fig. 2A and S4A ). However, superimposing of these two core maps exhibit more density near the catalytic site in the active map (Fig. S4A) . These extra densities corresponding to the loops, L1, L2, and LD ( Fig. 2B) , which were not resolved in inactive EP (Fig. S2A ). Overlaying our activated structure with the published crystalized model (PDB ID: 4DGJ) shows overall a good match, with the catalytic pocket well determined by surface loops, the connected three \u03b2-strands, and the disulfide bond Cys967-Cys995 (Figs. 2B-C and S4B). This pocket organization is attributed by the newly-formed N-terminus of the light chain after cleavage, which is the conserved N-terminal activation peptide sequence (IVGG) 36 . This sequence turns over ~180 degrees, and Ile785 shifts by 16.6 \u00c5 to probably stabilize loop L1 by a salt bridge with the side chain of Asp970, allosterically steady the catalytic center of EP compared to that in the inactive state ( Fig. 2C-E) .",

Hence, the mutation of the catalytic triad abolishes the catalytic activity, but do not introduce any significant catalytic pocket rearrangement. Putting together, the enzymatic activity of EP is initiated by the flipping of IVGG to stabilize the L1, L2, and LD loops surrounding the catalytic sites. The surface charge provided by the catalytic triad is believed to have no effects on the EP activation, but could affect catalytic substrate reaction probably by lowering substrate binding affinity.",

The inappropriate activation of pancreatic trypsinogen was believed to cause acute pancreatitis, with the underlying molecular mechanism representing a critical clue for pancreatitis therapy 18 . Acquired EP deficiency may be the origin of indigestion and malabsorption caused by functional pancreatic insufficiency 13, 19, 49 . EP, the physiological activator of trypsinogen, has been discovered for more than 100 years 1, 50, 51 and S4D), indicating the hEP is in a nearly physiological state. Thus, we proposed a working model for hEP functionality (Fig. 5) . It emerged as a zymogen, requiring trypsin or other related proteases to activate 6, 23, 24 . Initially, the peptidase domain on the light chain was protected by the multi-domains of heavy chain, inaccessible to the substrate. Upon activation, the relative dynamics between the EP-core and the LCM domains might originate from the rapid movement of the core region, with the LCM domains closely connected to the immobilized TM domain. This large flexibility facilitates the substrate recruitment and exposes the catalytic sites for subsequent cleavage. Once trypsinogen bound to CUB2, it reduces the dynamic energy and improves the stability of the complex. After the cleavage of the N-terminal tail, trypsin is released to initiate the pancreatic zymogens cascade. Then the EP goes back to its dynamic state to recruit and catalyze more trypsinogen. These novel discoveries elucidate the activation mechanism of EP toward the catalytic cleavage trypsinogen.",

Our structural analysis of EP and its complex with substrate is an important step to decrypt the pathogenesis of pancreatitis and may open a new direction for the treatment of pancreatitis. We carried out cryo-EM analysis of the EP in inactive, active, inhibited and substrate-bound states and revealed the EP structures with distinct conformations. The inactive EP-core (524-1,019 residues, ~56KDa) reached 2.7 \u00c5 as the highest resolution among all structures, indicating a tight and steady assembly. Our active structures reveal that the trypsin-treated EP remodels the activation domain by the N-terminus of the light chain, turning the whole steady enzyme into the dynamic active conformation. The binding of nafamostat enables us to delineate the most complete profile of EP, representing the general inhibition mechanism by covalent bond and occupancy. While in the substrate-bound structure, the architecture discovered the recognition and binding of macromolecular trypsinogen on CUB2 domain. Our high-resolution structures detected all the glycan densities (Figs. 1C, 2A, 3D,",
