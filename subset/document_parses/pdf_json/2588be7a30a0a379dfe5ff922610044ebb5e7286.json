Global concerns about the COVID-19 pandemic have persisted due to the lack of therapeutics, which has increased the uncertainty and awareness of SARS-CoV-2 infection. To prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2 infection, quarantine and social distancing measures have limited the physical and social activities of the population. In addition, economic distress followed, with increased disparities due to job loss and economic uncertainty. Furthermore, nationwide strategies to suppress SARS-CoV-2 contraction have been suggested to have adverse impacts in terms of the prevalence of psychological disorders (Brooks et al. 2020; Bauerle et al. 2020; Luo et al. 2020) . In a meta-analysis study, the prevalence of depression was found to be approximately 33% worldwide during the COVID-19 pandemic (95% confidence intervals [95% CI] = 28%-38%) (Luo et al. 2020) . Quarantine increased posttraumatic stress, confusion, and anger due to social isolation, fears of infection, inadequate supplies, uncertainties, financial deficits, and stigma (Brooks et al. 2020) .",

From that time, Korea underwent the first wave of the COVID-19 crisis until April 2020 (Kim and Ashihara 2020) . To cope with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Korean government implemented several strategies, including quarantine, levels of social distancing, a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 testing, tracking of the SARS-CoV-2 infection route, and the coverage of all treatment costs for all patients with COVID-19 (Kim and Ashihara 2020). Although these government efforts have prevented nationwide disasters, concerns about mental health were inevitable in Korea (Hyun et al. 2020) . COVID-19 patients with mental illness had more severe COVID-19 than COVID-19 patients without mental illness (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.01-1.66) . In addition to patients contracting SARS-CoV-2, the potential risk of depression associated with the COVID-19 pandemic has been suggested, such as among healthcare workers and physical therapists in Korea (Park, Hwang, et al. 2020; Yang et al. 2020 ). In addition to healthcare workers being exposed to patients with COVID-19, workers with low exposure also suffered from depression and anxiety (Park, Hwang, et al. 2020) . Thus, it can be supposed that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an adverse impact on the rate of depression in the Korean population. However, to our knowledge, a comparison of depression between the periods before and during the pandemic considering socioeconomic status has not been performed in a large cohort population.",

The elderly population is a high-risk group for both COVID-19 and depression (Lee, Jeong, and Yim 2020) . Pandemic-associated factors, such as social restraint, social distancing, and isolation, could increase the risk of depression, especially in elderly individuals (Lee, Jeong, and Yim 2020; Armitage and Nellums 2020) . However, resilience to these factors has been suggested to be higher in elderly individuals (Morales-Vives et al. 2020) . Regarding differences according to sex, middle-aged men, but not women, showed lower odds of depression in this study. A cross-sectional study described that during the lockdown period to control the COVID-19 outbreak in Spain, women tended to have greater stress, higher levels of extraversion and neuroticism, and lower self-esteem, which were estimated using a general health questionnaire, a satisfaction with life scale, and a subjective happiness scale, than men (all P < 0.001) (Morales-Vives et al. 2020 ). In addition to having a large amount of life experience and wisdom, most individuals in the older population are not engaged in economic activities and are retired, so they may be less influenced by unemployment or a decreased salary due to COVID-19 outbreak than the economically active population. Moreover, economic support by the Korean government may have attenuated the economic difficulties and social isolation of the older population.",

Moreover, demographic factors, socioeconomic factors, lifestyle-related variables, and comorbidities were extensively collected and adjusted for the analyses. Depression was surveyed using two methods, namely, an indicator of the experience of depression and the PHQ-9 score. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the presence of depression was consistent in both measures of depression. However, a few limitations need to be considered in the interpretation of the present results. This study could not follow each participant for changes in depression. The 2019 group and 2020 group were independently enrolled each year. In addition, the severity of depression and treatment histories of depression could not be specified. Although many covariables were considered, there may be some variables that could influence the association of the COVID-19 pandemic and depression, such as marital status, occupation, and number of family members. This study used a Korean population cohort, but there may be ethnic and regional differences in the relationship between the COVID-19 pandemic and depression . Last, the participants were surveyed during the early COVID-19 pandemic period; therefore, the delayed impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on depression needs to be studied in future studies.",
