The Q-PROTECT regimen was selected in March 2020, to match the approach reported successful in Marseille [1] . However, some studies have utilized higher HC doses in the initial days of therapy, and many studies use different daily maintenance doses or durations of therapy. For example, as compared to the one-week Q-PROTECT regimen of 200 mg HC three times daily, Arshad and colleagues [25] and Mitja and colleagues [11] both utilized a day one 800 mg dose followed by 200 mg twice daily for less than a week.

First, the bottle pairs were identical (other than the different study numbers on the labels). Second, study physicians and nurses were not observing when the participants opened the bottle and took the medication.

Residents of Qatar who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but who were asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic, were allowed home quarantine if this could be safely executed. In practice, this translated into home quarantine for long-term residents or families. Those who lived in shared domiciles (e.g. dormitories, hotels) were required to serve quarantine in facilities for which HMC provided healthcare, but for which administration (including access control and security) came under the purview of the Ministry of the Interior (MOI).Gaining access to the quarantine facilities was logistically and administratively challenging. Facilities were well outside of Doha, entailing extended travel times for study physicians. Furthermore, since security arrangements for quarantine facilities were administered by the MOI there were extensive clearances required for each facility. This situation led to a decision to accrue participants at a single site, Umm Qarn (located within an hour of HGH).Even within Umm Qarn, Q-PROTECT's study physicians (nearly all were male) were not able to gain access to the female section of the quarantine housing. Thus Q-PROTECT enrolled virtually all males, and the nationality cross-section reflected the nationality of expatriates rather than those native to Qatar or surrounding countries (who were most likely to live in single-family dwellings).Tables A1,A2,A3,A4",
