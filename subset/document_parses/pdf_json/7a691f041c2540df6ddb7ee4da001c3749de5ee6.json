This pathway can drive pathological inflammation, as documented for type I interferonopathies. In contrast, specific STING activation and subsequent IFN-\u03b2 release have shown beneficial effects on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as a model for multiple sclerosis (MS). Although less severe cases of relapse-remitting MS (RRMS) are treated with IFN-\u03b2, there is little information correlating aberrant type I IFN signaling and the pathologic conditions of MS. We hypothesized that there is a link between STING activation and the endogenous production of IFN-\u03b2 during neuroinflammation. Gene expression analysis in EAE mice showed that Sting level decreased in the peripheral lymphoid tissue, while its level increased within the central nervous system over the course of the disease. Similar patterns could be verified in peripheral immune cells during the acute phases of RRMS in comparison to remitting phases and appropriately matched healthy controls. Our study is the first to provide evidence that the STING/IFN-\u03b2-axis is downregulated in RRMS patients, meriting further intensified research to understand its role in the pathophysiology of MS and potential translational applications.",

            "text": "Novel findings in the last decade revealed that the induction of IFN-\u03b2 is triggered, among others, by the stimulator of IFN genes (STING) pathway [15, 17, 22, 23] . This pathway is initiated by cytosolic sensors upon recognition of pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMP), like virus-derived nucleic acids. As the most relevant initiator of this pathway within the innate immune system in humans, cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) synthase (cGAS) detects cytosolic nucleic acid and subsequently produces 2 3 -cGAMP, a cyclic dinucleotide (CDN) [15, 17, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] . In turn, 2 3 -cGAMP serves as a second messenger and can directly bind to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-resident adapter protein STING, thus inducing the TANK-binding kinase 1/interferon regulatory factor-3-dependent IFN-\u03b2 production [22, 27] . In the case of the inappropriate recognition of self-derived endogenous nucleic acid, there is a risk of triggering autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, as already assumed for type I interferonopathies [28, 29] . Several lines of evidence suggest a critical role of the STING pathway in MS. Insights from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) studies, a commonly used animal model to investigate molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying the immunopathogenic processes of MS, proved the beneficial effects of the specific activation of STING in vivo. One study demonstrated that administration of STING-activating reagents, i.e., DNA nanoparticles (DNP) and a bacterial CDN, significantly reduces disease severity along with delaying EAE onset due to a type I IFN-dependent production of indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase (IDO), a natural immunoregulatory enzyme, in dendritic cells [30] . Lemos et al. further demonstrated that the beneficial activity of IDO, which can suppress inflammatory T cell responses, is fostered by manipulating STING/IFN-I-dependent signaling in EAE mice [31] . In this context, the importance of the cytosolic sensor cGAS was also emphasized [31] . Together with the finding that experimental blockage with the antiviral drug ganciclovir alleviated EAE by decreasing microglial reactivity in a STING/type I IFN-dependent fashion [32], these data suggest this pathway as a novel target for treating MS.",

Our examinations demonstrated that, along with BMDC and mouse brain microvascular endothelial cells (MBMEC), CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes, as well as regulatory thymus-derived CD4 + CD25 high T (tT reg ) cells and their Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2020, 21, 9249 3 of 15 non-regulatory counterparts, exhibit the most augmented expression of Tmem173 under na\u00efve conditions compared to B cells.

Among the various treatments, the first available disease-modifying therapy for treating MS was interferon (IFN)-\u03b2, which was approved for Europe in 1998 after a series of successful trials [3] [4] [5] [6] .

Interestingly, in contrast to na\u00efve conditions, the expression of Tmem173 is distinctly increased in the inflamed spinal cord parenchyma. This elevation at the main site of inflammatory lesions in chronic EAE [34] seems to correlate with disease progression since the highest Tmem173 expression was detected at disease maximum. Its level slightly decreased during the chronic EAE phase but was still high in comparison to the gene expression level in na\u00efve spinal cord parenchyma ( Figure 1C ).",

After 4 h of treatment, a type I IFN response could be measured by quantification of the expression of IFNB1 and IFNA2 genes, encoding IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1, respectively. Both the expression of IFNB1 (fold change of 210.4 \u00b1 41.1) and IFNA2 (fold change of 71.2 \u00b1 13.6) were considerably increased in samples treated with 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP plus digitonin compared to controls receiving only one of the two ( Figure 3A ,B). In line with the latter results, protein levels with conclusive evidence for IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-\u03b1 could be verified after 24 h solely within the obtained culture supernatants of samples treated with 2\u20323\u2032-cGAMP in the presence of digitonin ( Figure 3C ,D). STING analysis on the protein level of human PBMC by multi-color flow cytometry exhibited similar patterns compared to their isotype control ( Figure 2B ). Our analysis, with 0.19 \u00b1 0.30%, revealed almost no STING expression for CD19 expressing B cells, which is in accordance with the literature, and utilizing western blot analysis shows that primary human B cells are deficient for STING protein expression [38] ( Figure 2B -left panel). In contrast, CD3 expressing lymphocytes showed a marginal expression of STING, with 6.86 \u00b1 2.69%, ( Figure 2B -middle panel), while myeloid cells, here marked by the expression of CD11b, had the highest protein expression of STING, which is in line with their transcript level data given above. 45.15 \u00b1 8.95% of CD11b expressing cells expressed STING within the human PBMC population under na\u00efve conditions ( Figure 2B -right panel).

            "text": "During neuroinflammation, principal genes involved in the STING/IFN-\u03b2 pathway seem to be considerably downregulated in MS patient-derived PBMC compared with their expression in HD. The enzyme cGAS, which initiates the pathway, is downregulated during the relapse phase of MS, with significantly lower amounts of MB21D1 transcripts (\u2206\u2206C t 3.18 \u00b1 0.62 relapse group) compared to the remission group (\u2206\u2206C t 0.70 \u00b1 0.34) ( Figure 5A) . A slight but significant downregulation could be proven for the transcript levels of both TMEM173 and IFNB1 within the MS relapse group. This effect was not observed in the remission group, which showed expression levels close to the HD group for these genes ( Figure 5B ,C). In contrast, the gene expression levels of IFNA2 were significantly upregulated within PBMC of both MS groups (\u2206\u2206C t \u22122.49 \u00b1 0.32 relapse group; \u2206\u2206C t \u22123.51 \u00b1 0.57 remission group) compared to the HD group (\u2206\u2206C t 0.00 \u00b1 0.86) ( Figure 5D ). Interestingly, the remission group had a significantly higher expression of the type I IFN receptor gene IFNAR1 (\u2206\u2206C t \u22122.42 \u00b1 0.67) compared to both the HD (\u2206\u2206C t 0.00 \u00b1 0.70) and the relapse group (\u2206\u2206C t 0.43 \u00b1 1.01) ( Figure 5E ). Together, these data suggest that the STING/IFN-\u03b2 pathway is significantly altered in the peripheral blood cells of patients with RRMS, indicating a vital immunomodulatory role of this pathway, not only in mice but also in humans.",

However, the effects and functions in both general (neuro) inflammatory processes and the more specific MS-related circumstances remain unclear. Our present study gives novel insights into the role of the STING/IFN-\u03b2-signaling pathway in the pathophysiological context of both EAE and RRMS. Our findings indicate some relevant interrelationships that merit further research efforts. We made the striking observation that over the course of chronic EAE, the level of Sting expression decreased in the peripheral lymphoid tissue, while its level increased at the main site of inflammatory lesions, the inflamed spinal cord parenchyma. Maximal clinical signs of EAE are associated with extensive immune cell infiltration mainly consisting of macrophages and T cells into the CNS through a disrupted blood-brain barrier [34] . Given that na\u00efve CNS tissue barely expressed the gene, leukocyte migration is a likely source for elevated Sting expression within the CNS of EAE induced mice. In line with our data, Mathur et al. showed detectable levels of STING protein expression in immunohistochemistry staining of the cerebellum of EAE mice at disease maximum, whereas no detectable levels were found under na\u00efve conditions [32] . In accordance with our observations gained from an animal model of MS, the level of STING expression was downregulated in peripheral immune cells during the acute phases of RRMS in comparison to clinically stable RRMS patients and appropriately matched HD. Moreover, the expression of further central players of the STING/IFN-\u03b2-signaling pathway, like the initiator cGAS and IFN-\u03b2 as a critical final product, was decreased in RRMS patients.",

            "text": "Infection with viruses, protozoa, or bacteria leads to an accumulation of cytosolic nucleic acids of extraneous origin that signals the presence of pathogens to the immune system. The human organism has several mechanisms to defend itself against the potential danger of nucleic acids of aberrant subcellular localization derived from endogenous sources or invading pathogens (e.g., viral infections). The STING/IFN-\u03b2-signaling pathway represents a central mechanism that is geared to respond to PAMPs by initiating a type I IFN immune response [15, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Its inappropriate activation has been linked to a variety of autoinflammatory and autoimmune disorders, termed type I interferonopathies. These include, for example, the severe Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome, which is associated with a cerebral overproduction of IFN-\u03b1 [28, 29] , thus underlining the need for tight regulation of responses. The pathophysiology of MS is also associated with an aberrant type I IFN response since treatment-na\u00efve RRMS patients exhibit not only a significantly reduced endogenous activity of peripheral IFN-\u03b2 [20] but also a markedly low expression of IFN-stimulated genes [40, 41] . The therapeutic administration of exogenous IFN-\u03b2, which is commonly used for less severe cases of RRMS, seems to correct this dysregulation, considering that it ameliorates disease activity in MS patients [7, 8, 41, 42] . Together with the knowledge that the STING pathway is critical for the production of IFN-\u03b2 [15, 17, 22, 23, 26, 27] , and its direct activation showed promising results in the EAE model [30] [31] [32] , it is likely that the STING/IFN-\u03b2-signaling pathway could account for the lower endogenous expression levels of IFN-\u03b2 and IFN-dependent genes underlying the pathophysiology of MS, as described by others [20, 40, 41] . In line, we further observed that peripheral levels of Sting expression were decreased during EAE and in therapy na\u00efve active RRMS patients. These patients showed decreased levels of cGAS as an initiator of STING/IFN-\u03b2-signaling and IFN-\u03b2, while therapy-na\u00efve stable RRMS patients revealed almost the same levels as found in HD.",

Clinical practice, however, has demonstrated restricted potency, as not all patients respond to IFN-\u03b2 treatment. The characterization of (partial) non-responders and responders to IFN-\u03b2 therapy disclosed that the presence of neutralizing antibodies to IFN-\u03b2 could only partly explain the limited response to IFN-\u03b2 [43] . Also, low type I IFN baseline levels in peripheral myeloid cells could reliably predict an effective therapeutic response to IFN-\u03b2, which would ideally be determined before starting treatment [21] . In other words, MS patients with poor response to IFN-\u03b2 seem to exhibit an already fully activated type I IFN signaling pathway that is refractory to the therapeutic administration of exogenous IFN-\u03b2 since it cannot be activated further. This was observed for myeloid cells but not for T and B cells [21] . The roles of T and B cells in the adaptive immune response are well known in MS pathophysiology. Although the importance of myeloid cells, including monocytes, macrophages, microglia, and dendritic cells, as part of the innate immune system is recognized in this context, their exact functions are less commonly considered in MS. Interestingly, we observed that human myeloid cells show not only the highest gene and protein expression of STING in comparison to T and B cells but also an elevated expression of IFN-\u03b2 after direct STING activation by 2 3 -cGAMP-a finding that suggests a possible relationship between STING activation and endogenous production of IFN-\u03b2 during neuroinflammation. We also speculate that the limited therapeutic effect of IFN-\u03b2 in some MS patients may be attributed to a STING/IFN-\u03b2-signaling pathway imbalance in myeloid cells. However, this needs to be clinically proven in further experiments since this study was not designed to characterize (partial) non-responders and responders to IFN-\u03b2 treatment in terms of their STING expression patterns within the various myeloid-derived immune cells. Here, we included defined groups of RRMS patients-an approach that we consider as an advantage in comparison to studies with mixed clinical MS groups.",

Even though digitonin permeabilization with subsequent CDN stimulation is widely applied [17, 23, 32, 38] , potential off-target effects cannot be excluded. Therefore, we standardly incubated the cells with just the permeabilization buffer or 2 3 -cGAMP, both as additional controls, and did not observe any strong influence on the effects of CDN stimulation, as marked by no or low expression of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2. Further, we did not have the opportunity to measure the amount of 2 3 -cGAMP reaching the cytoplasm for activation of the STING/IFN-\u03b2-signaling pathway. A radioactive-labeled 2 3 -cGAMP represents a way to monitor the location and distribution of CDN during stimulation, similar to the method used by Burdette et al. In HEK293T cells [23] , but was not a feasible approach to be applied within our laboratory setting. Since we adapted their general CDN stimulation protocol, we assumed that the intracellular concentrations reached similar levels. Of note, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that the protein expression of STING was intracellularly assessed using flow cytometric analysis, which paves the way for future research. In accordance with our findings on the mRNA levels, human myeloid cells comprise the subset with the strongest STING protein signal determined via flow cytometry, indicating a reliable method to quantify its protein level.",

The role of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), which is a natural stimulus leading to the production of type I IFN, is often discussed in relation to MS. It is currently argued whether EBV-infected B cells may also contribute to triggering aberrant immune responses in MS [44, 45] . It is reasonable to assume that the EBV can exploit human B lymphocytes as a reservoir for persistent infection because these cells are lacking detectable levels of the central adaptor protein STING, necessary to activate IFN I secretion upon the detection of foreign viral nucleic acids [38] . Nevertheless, it is unlikely that an EBV imbalance accounts for the different type I IFN responses in IFN-\u03b2 responders and non-responders of MS patients, as both groups showed similar levels of EBV reactivation [21] . Concerning the current coronavirus pandemic, recent functional in vitro analysis found that IFN-\u03b2 treatment effectively blocks SARS-CoV-2 replication in a dose-dependent manner, indicating a possible side benefit for MS patients treated with IFN-\u03b2 [46] .",

A better understanding of its immunomodulatory role could lead to a more profound assessment of IFN-\u03b2 therapy responders and give insights into the pathophysiology of signaling events underlying MS in general. Moreover, the recent discovery that the STING/IFN-\u03b2-signaling pathway is linked to the pathology of EAE and possibly MS is strengthened by the fact that its specific activation leads to an improved clinical EAE course by inducing an IFN type I response [30] [31] [32] . In this respect, new highly potent CDN STING agonists may be of future interest [30] [31] [32] . Considering these different perspectives, targeting the STING/IFN-\u03b2-signaling is of therapeutic interest [47] . Since cGAS is up-regulated and mediates inflammation in the brain in neurodegenerative disorders like Huntington's disease, central STING/type I IFN-dependent effects may also be relevant [48] . This takes into account that the antiviral drug ganciclovir alleviated EAE by decreasing microglial reactivity in a STING/type I IFN-dependent fashion [32] and that HIV-infected patients showed a lower MS incidence when treated with antiviral drugs [49, 50] . Notably, since pacemaker channels present in the thalamus show a unique nanomolar affinity for 2 3 -cGAMP, there is an interesting possibility that these ion channels may contribute to central MS pathology [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] . However, we need more detailed information from further studies to draw definite conclusions regarding the role of the STING/IFN-\u03b2-signaling in the disturbed homeostasis of MS and to verify our observations.",
