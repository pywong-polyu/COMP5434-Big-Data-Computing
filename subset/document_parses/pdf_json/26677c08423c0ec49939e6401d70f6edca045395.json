            "text": "Mobile health, which is not limited by time and space, can effectively alleviate the imbalance of medical resources. Currently, more and more hospitals begin to pay attention to online medical care and actively expand their mobile channels. Among of which, the cooperation with the third-party platform is an effective way to expand the online services of most hospitals. With the increasing number of mobile health applications (mHealth apps), it is difficult to select the ideal application. Most of the existing studies on mHealth app selection are conducted from the perspective of users who have health needs, which is insufficient. The views of multiple stakeholders should be taken into account. mHealth app selection can be regarded as a large-scale group decision making (LSGDM) problem. In this paper, a hybrid LSGDM method is proposed to select the mHealth app with the highest user satisfaction. First, the weights of criteria are obtained based on quality function deployment and 2-additive measure. Furthermore, a consensus model that considers cooperative and non-cooperative behaviors of decision makers is applied to select the ideal mHealth app. Finally, an illustrative example is implemented to exhibit the utility and validity of the proposed model.",

In the first half of 2020, the number of mobile medical users in China has reached 590 million, and the market size of mobile medical treatment has reached 8.75 billion Yuan [3] . The mHealth apps have become the main way for patients to obtain medical services during epidemic prevention. In China, these apps mainly focus on information inquiry, telemedicine, online consultation, registration, appointment, and health management [18, 24, 47] . Users can access contactless medical services regardless of time or location through mHealth apps, which is beneficial to deal with a public health emergency. Importantly, the popularity of mHealth apps contributes to relieve the imbalance in the allocation of medical resources in China. Furthermore, mobile medicine developed with the advantages of mobile technology can not only meet people's medical needs but also effectively alleviate some medical dilemmas in China [24] . In this situation, the Chinese government has issued a series of policies to vigorously promote the development of mobile medicine [15, 37] .",

The wide use of smartphones has a great impact on medical services. Traditional medical care no longer meets the requirements of consumers, and hospitals must promote medical reform. On the other hand, the fierce competition between hospitals has extended from offline to online. Thus, hospitals must expand mobile channels, building their platforms or cooperating with third-party platforms [22, 61] , to provide diversified mobile healthcare. Nevertheless, the construction and operating costs of building the platform are very high. Additionally, it needs to recruit and establish professional teams to operate and maintain the platform. Most hospitals don't have enough manpower and resources to build a mobile platform. The cooperation with the third-party platform becomes the first choice of hospitals. In this mode, third-party platforms are responsible for the specific operation and maintenance of the platform, and hospitals concentrate on their core services [22] . The third-party platform without offline entities is not allowed to provide diagnostic services in China [29] . Only in cooperation with the physical hospital, the thirdparty platform can be eligible to prescribe drugs for patients, which forms a closed-loop of medical treatment. At present, Chunyu doctor, Good doctor online, and other well-known platforms have cooperated with physical hospitals. As for hospitals, the medical services are no longer restricted by time and location, and the cost of the hospital is lower than that of building their own platforms. Both the third-party platform and hospital can benefit from this mode. Consequently, cooperation with the third-party platform is the best choice for most hospitals.",

In fact, it is incomprehensive for mHealth app selection and the views of multiple stakeholders (such as health care providers and professionals) should be taken into account. Therefore, this study continues to research the selection of mHealth apps, which considers the opinions of mHealth app users including patients, healthcare providers, nurses, and professionals. In this situation, there are numerous decision makers (DMs) with diverse knowledge backgrounds involved in the mHealth app selection, which is in fact a largescale group decision making (LSGDM) problem.",

            "text": "With the increasing complexity of the decision environment, more and more DMs participate in the decision process, and LSGDM has been widely concerned and applied [62, 63] . One object of LSGDM is to select the best alternative from finite ones according to the assessment information provided by DMs [11] . In LSGDM, it usually contains more than 20 DMs who provide assessment information for alternatives based on several criteria [27] . It is inevitable that the opinions or preferences of DMs are quite different [40, 53] . Therefore, the consensus reaching process (CRP), which is a dynamic and iterative process, is applied to assist DMs to adjust opinions and reach a consensus. However, it is difficult to achieve a full and unanimous agreement in real life [58] . Soft consensus that reflects partial agreements has been widely applied [8] . To solve LSGDM problems, Xu et al. [55] developed a two-stage consensus method to adjust the internal and external consensus levels of sub-clusters. Li et al. [25] introduced a LSGDM approach for healthcare management in the setting of hesitant fuzzy linguistic environment. Shi et al. [43] designed a CRP to classify modification behaviors of DMs into 3 categories by cooperative index and non-cooperative index and update DMs' weights based on the uninorm aggregation operator. Xu et al. [54] presented a confidence-based model to manage non-cooperative behaviors. To deal with the heterogeneous preference information and non-cooperative behaviors in LSGDM, Chao et al. [7] developed a novel consensus model. Li et al. [26] introduced a group consistency index which combines fuzzy preference values and cooperation degrees to detect the non-cooperative behaviors of DMs in LSGDM. Based on hesitant fuzzy preference relation, Liu et al. [32] proposed a reliability index-based consensus model to manage the non-cooperative clusters. In view of robust optimization, Lu et al. [34] presented a minimum cost consensus model to solve the LSGDM problem in social network. Gao et al. [14] introduced a k-core decomposition-based method to identify the opinion leader in social network and proposed a clustering-based consensus model to improve the consensus level of LSGDM problem.",

In addition, there is a positive interaction between price and configuration, namely, the better the mobile phone configuration, the higher the price. (iii) Most consensus models only adjust the subgroup with the lowest consensus level, which causes the inefficiency of consensus reaching. (iv) Some LSGDM methods adopt the consensus adjustment mechanism for subgroup decision matrices, which usually causes the over-adjustment.",

First, we construct the evaluation criteria for mHeath app selection and identify user requirements (URs). Then, considering the interdependence of criteria, we propose a hybrid method to obtain the weights of criteria by using analytic hierarchy process (AHP), quality function deployment (QFD) and 2additive measure. Next, we provide different modification recommendations to improve the consensus level based on the group consensus level and the willingness of subgroups. Finally, we aggregate DMs' opinions by the 2-additive generalized Shapley aggregation (2AGSA) operator to select the ideal mHealth app. Figure 1 presents the research framework of this study.",

As a branch of GDM, LSGDM which usually involves a large number of DMs with diverse interests and knowledge has been paid more attention and applied to many real-world problems.

For example, there is a positive interaction between engagement and functionality. With the powerful functions of mHealth app, users will have a high sense of participation. In addition, there is a positive interaction between customization and interactivity. The mHealth app that allows mass customization appears high interaction. To model the weights of criteria in MCDM problems, Sugeno [46] proposed the concept of fuzzy measure, which can flexibly describe the interactions among criteria and generalize the additive measure by replacing the additive property with monotonicity [16] . In this subsection, we present some definitions regarding fuzzy measure and apply the 2-additive measure to obtain the interactions among criteria.",

Currently, the theory and application of MCDM that considers the interaction characteristics have been researched by many scholars [50, 57] . However, with the number of criteria increasing, the coefficients of fuzzy measure will grow exponentially. When the number of criteria is n, it requires 2 n-1 coefficients to determine a fuzzy measure. While the 2additive measure only takes into account the interaction between the two criteria, it only needs (n + 2)(n-1)/2 coefficients. Considering this advantage of 2-additive measure, we employ it to measure the interactions among criteria and identify a 2-additive measure by Zhang et al.'s method [60] .

[30] designed a feedback mechanism to detect the objects that need to be modified. First, the subgroup with the minimum subgroup consensus level was identified. Then, they detected the alternatives that need to be adjusted from the selected subgroup. Finally, they modified the preference values that didn't meet the consensus requirement. In this study, we propose a Table 18 shows the main results. Figure 6 visually shows that concrete changes of the related interactions of these three CPR models.
