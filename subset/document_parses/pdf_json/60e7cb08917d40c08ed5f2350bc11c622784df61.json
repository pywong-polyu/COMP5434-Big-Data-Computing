            "text": "The implementation of deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis systems for the classification of mammogram images can help in improving the accuracy, reliability, and cost of diagnosing patients. However, training a deep learning model requires a considerable amount of labelled images, which can be expensive to obtain as time and effort from clinical practitioners are required. To address this, a number of publicly available datasets have been built with data from different hospitals and clinics, which can be used to pre-train the model. However, using models trained on these datasets for later transfer learning and model fine-tuning with images sampled from a different hospital or clinic might result in lower performance. This is due to the distribution mismatch of the datasets, which include different patient populations and image acquisition protocols. In this work, a real-world scenario is evaluated where a novel target dataset sampled from a private Costa Rican clinic is used, with few labels and heavily imbalanced data. The use of two popular and publicly available datasets (INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) as source data, to train and test the models on the novel target dataset, is evaluated. A common approach to further improve the model's performance under such small labelled target dataset setting is data augmentation. However, often cheaper unlabelled data is available from the target clinic. Therefore, semi-supervised deep learning, which leverages both labelled and unlabelled data, can be used in such conditions. In this work, we evaluate the semi-supervised deep learning approach known as MixMatch, to take advantage of unlabelled data from the target dataset, for whole mammogram image classification. We compare the usage of semi-supervised learning on its own, and combined with transfer learning (from a source mammogram dataset) with data augmentation, as also against regular supervised learning with transfer learning and data augmentation from source datasets. It is shown that the use of a semi-supervised deep learning combined with transfer learning and data augmentation can provide a meaningful advantage when using scarce labelled observations. Also, we found a strong influence of the source dataset, which suggests a more data-centric approach needed to tackle the challenge of scarcely labelled data. We used several different metrics to assess the performance gain of using semi-supervised learning, when dealing with very imbalanced test datasets (such as the G-mean and the F2-score), as mammogram datasets are often very imbalanced.",

For mammogram analysis, different deep learning architectures have been proposed, for either binary classification, BI-RADS-based multi-class classification, or segmentation of regions of interest [1, 29] . Frequently, previously proposed architectures for mammogram classification (binary or multi-class), use large open datasets that have been gathered in a specific group of hospitals in one or few countries. These results might not be representative for a system deployed in a small hospital/clinic from a specific country (target hospital or clinic). When implementing and deploying a deep learning solution in such target hospital/clinic, usually a very small labelled dataset is available. Using small labelled datasets frequently hampers the model's generalization and performance. Nevertheless, cheaper unlabelled data might available in the target hospital/clinic.",

We use a novel labelled dataset from a Costa Rican clinic, showing the practical challenges of using deep learning for mammogram analysis. Therefore, we include a data-centric approach in our proposed pipeline, as we evaluate the usage of different source datasets for transfer learning and further model fine-tuning using semi-supervised learning (along with data augmentation). The evaluation of the different configurations tested in this work, can shed light around the impact of using each one of the tested approaches individually and combined.

As such, different levels of annotations in the data might be needed for lower level tasks, like pixel-level annotations of the Region of Interest (ROI). When using transfer learning to leverage information from thoroughly annotated source datasets for lower level tasks, fine-tuning on the target data might still be needed [20] . These similar degrees of annotations would be preferable in the target dataset as well.

Two of the most straightforward techniques used include under-sampling and over-sampling [56] . These techniques, although fairly simple and intuitive, might not prove to be the best choice, as they can lead respectively to information loss and over fitting [56] . Other common approaches used towards imbalanced class distributions in datasets involve the so-called cost-sensitive learning [56] . One implementation of this approach is to give weights to each class inside the cross-entropy loss function to correct for class imbalance. In the case of semisupervised learning, authors in [17] proposed a similar technique called Pseudo-label-based Balance Correction (PBC). This technique applies class-balance correction both to the labelled and unlabelled data in the MixMatch SSDL approach. Given its reported positive results, we implement the class imbalance correction approach tested in [17] in our work.",

The performance of models directly trained on the target dataset using SSDL, without domain adaptation from a source mammography dataset (Config. SSDL) was also tested. Class imbalance correction of the loss function with the PBC method developed in [17] was also used as part of the experiments of configurations SSDL+FT, S+FT and SSDL. The empirical results obtained in this study showed a considerable impact of its usage for correcting data imbalance. Therefore, we included it to train all of the tested SSDL models. Finally, all models were evaluated on test images from our novel target Costarrican dataset.",

Physical labels, orientation tags and scanning artifacts are some of the types of noise inducing elements that can be found in mammogram images, as illustrated in [44] . To minimize the effects of these types of noise, a similar approach to the one described in [8] was implemented and applied to images from the CBIS-DDSM dataset. This is shown in Fig. 11 . Authors in [8] describe the implemented preprocessing pipeline in this work, designed for background removal in mammograms. The process consists mainly on the application of a rolling ball algorithm with radius = 5. This is followed by the application of Huang's fuzzy thresholding and morphological transformations of erosion and dilation. This process results in a binary map that can be used to remove background noise from an image.

The low average G-Mean values yielded by models trained on each of the source datasets show a deficient ability to correctly discriminate between both classes. This situation is confirmed by the yielded average recall and specificity values, which show a clear imbalance of the discrimination accuracy for each class. Low average F2-Score values also reinforce this conclusion, showing a relatively high number of FP in proportion to true positives (TP) predictions. The \"accuracy paradox\" can also be seen in the yielded average accuracy scores of Table 2 . Models trained on D l s,IN scored notably lower accuracy values in comparison to models trained on D l s,DDSM . However, further analysis suggests that the higher accuracy scores of the latter models were due to their relatively high specificity scores. This shows a clear bias on the accuracy scores for the majority class (negative cases). Table 3 shows the classification performance results of models trained with SSDL on the target dataset, without domain adaptation from a source mammography dataset. Considerably high standard deviations are observed for the majority of the results. Despite this, the average values of both G-Mean and F2-Score show steady improvements as the number of n l t increases. It is only logical that these models are able to make a better use of an increased number of labelled observations for training. This is mainly due to the fact that they do not possess previous domainknowledge from a source dataset.",

Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were applied to these results in order to identify statistically significant (p-values < 0.05) differences between the performance of the models fine-tuned either in a supervised manner or with the SSDL method. Therefore, the null hypothesis is defined as that there is no statistically significant difference of using semi-supervised learning against using conventional supervised learning. The alternative hypothesis refers to the statistically significant difference between using semisupervised learning against using supervised learning. Table 5 shows the results of the models first trained on D l s,IN and then fine-tuned on the target dataset. The results with other architectures are depicted in the Supplementary material. Models fine-tuned with SSDL generally yielded moderately better average G-Mean and F2-Score results in comparison to models fine-tuned using a supervised manner. This happens specially when using a reduced number of labelled observations for training (n l t = 20, 40), as the perceived gains decrease with a higher value of n l t . With more labels, the results tend to reveal less statistical significance with p-values > 0.05. Therefore, we reject the previously stated null hypothesis, when few labels are used (n l t = 20, 40). When comparing the models performance of the configurations SSDL, and SSDL+FT, described in Tables 3, 5 and 6, we can see two different scalability trends, with respect to n l t . The SSDL configuration (with no fine-tuning), yields considerably lower performance scores, when compared to the SSDL+FT configuration. However, it scales better, when n l t increases. This suggests that the SSDL+FT configuration, with initial knowledge on the target task (mammogram classification), is less benefited when the number of labels grows.",

These models appear to be biased to Table 3 Classification performance for models of configuration SSDL, using the VGG-19 architecture the majority class.

These results indicate that the feature distributions (using a generic ImageNet pre-trained model) between both source datasets and the target dataset are significantly different. This can explain the poor results of configuration S+No-FT as a high dissimilarity is accurately suggesting that some sort of domain adaption is needed. At the same time, a lower dissimilarity between D l s,DDSM and D b t,CR might indicate that the former could be better suited to be used as a source dataset, as seen in the yielded performance behaviour for both datasets in Tables 5 and 6 . The reasons behind a higher dissimilarity between two datasets need to be explored further. Table 4 summarizes the performance of the models with the lowest number of labels. The average G-Mean scores are shown for models fine-tuned with the lowest number of labelled observations. The results in Table 4 show how the model architecture constitutes an important factor in the yielded performance of the models. As seen previously, SSDL+FT and S+FT, using n l t = 20 labelled observations. The corresponding number of trainable parameters for the PyTorch-implementation of each architecture is also shown SSDL models show better performance in comparison to supervised ones. However, the improved gains are stronger for the more complex models (i.e. architectures with more trainable parameters).",

In the experiments carried out in this work, it was found that this combination can achieve significant improvements on the classification performance of deep learning models. This surpasses the performance of models without transfer learning or without the use of unlabelled target data. The experiments depicted in this work also reveal the importance of using transfer learning from source datasets. Still, the highest yielded performance of the SSDL model with fine-tuning have a large room for improvement. Enforcing further supervision with small labelled datasets (pixel-wise labelling of the regions of interest), with other forms of weak or self-supervision [55] and/or domain adaptation [49] , along with more complex data augmentation approaches as in [25] , might improve the overall model performance. This must be done without raising too much the need of expensive labelling.",

In general, specific data quality metrics for deep learning models to solve medical imaging challenges is still a very underdeveloped topic in the literature. We plan to contribute in such data-oriented metric development in the medical imaging analysis field in the future. In future work, we aim to explore computationally efficient and informative data quality metrics for deep learning architectures. Feature space-based quality metrics can be explored in more recent deep learning architectures such as transformers [39] .
