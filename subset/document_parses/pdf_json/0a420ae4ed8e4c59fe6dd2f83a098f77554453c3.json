Here, we broaden the scope and depth of previous investigations by analysing 194 DWMs until July 2021, including the crucial period in which vaccines became available, and by considering the wider impact of the pandemic on DWMs. First, we focus on vaccines. We find 250 listings offering approved vaccines, like Pfizer/BioNTech and AstraZeneca, as well as vendors offering fabricated proofs of vaccination and COVID-19 passports. Second, we consider COVID-19 related products. We reveal that, as the regular economy has become able to satisfy the demand of these goods, DWMs have decreased their offer. Third, we analyse the profile of vendors of COVID-19 related products and vaccines. We find that most of them are specialized in a single type of listings and are willing to ship worldwide. Finally, we consider a broader set of listings mentioning COVID-19 as proxy for the general impact of the pandemic on these DWMs .",

            "text": "Interpol warned about illicit offering of COVID-19 vaccines already on December 2, 2020, 7 while Europol confirmed the sale of fake COVID-19 vaccines on dark web marketplaces (DWMs) on December 4, 2020, 8 which \"may pose a significant risk to public health\". *Understanding how DWMs reacted to the demand for vaccines is therefore crucial to allow policy and public health agencies to be prepared and effectively counteract these threats in the future Interpol and Europol's concern were validated by early research showing that DWMs have been an important channel to access online illicit trade during the pandemic, with masks, COVID-19 tests, and alleged medicines consistently advertised on these platforms. In a first report, 9 222 COVID-19 related unique listings were registered on April 3rd, 2020 in 20 DWMs. In our previous work, 10 788 COVID-19 related listings were observed 9, 464 times between January 1, 2020 and November 16, 2020 in 30 DWM, showing how DWMs swiftly reacted to shortages and public attention by offering sought products like masks and hydroxychloroquine. More recent reports, carried by the Global Initiative and Europol, have suggested that the overall structure of illicit online trading has gained significant benefits from COVID- 19. 11, 12 DWMs are an ideal venue to participate in online illicit activities. They can be easily accessed via specialized browsers, e.g., Tor, 13 that hide they identity and location of their users, and offer a variety of illicit goods including drugs, firearms, credit cards, and fake IDs. 14 DWMs drew the attention of hundreds of thousands buyers and sellers over the years, with a trading volume that rapidly reached hundreds millions United States dollars (USD) per year. 15, 16 The growing popularity of DWMs has attracted the interest of the scientific community, security researchers, and law enforcement agencies. The scientific community has explored the behaviour of DWMs users through comparative analyses [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] and case studies. [24] [25] [26] Law enforcement agencies have successfully closed several DWMs, seizing millions of USD, and performing dozen of arrests. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] However, DWMs are intrinsically resilient to these interventions, 16 also thanks to the emergence of decentralized trade around them, 34 and 2020 has been a record year for their revenue. 35, 36 Here, we report on our analysis of 194 DWMs until July 22, 2021 . Throughout the pandemic, we detected a total of 10,330 unique listings that were directly affected by COVID-19, i.e., mentioning COVID-19 either in their body or title. Among these listings, 250 were offering vaccines. It is important to note that a listing does not correspond to the sale of a unit, as sometimes happens for example on Ebay, but corresponds to the availability of multiple units of a product, similarly to what happens for example on Amazon. Listings related to approved vaccines were initially detected on the Invictus marketplace starting from November 17, 2020, almost 2 weeks before their official approval. Also, listings offering a fabricated proof of vaccination were registered on the Hydra marketplace since February 15, 2021 . These listings replaced previously identified COVID-19 related products, like PPEs, COVID-19 tests, and guides on how to illicitly obtain COVID-19 relief funds. The availability of these products have decreased with respect to previous observations, with only 187 listings detected between November 2020 and July 2021 against the 788 registered between January and November 2020. 10 Many vendors selling these products are highly specialised in only a type of product and willing to ship worldwide, thereby increasing the number of potential customers. By analysing all listings mentioning COVID-19, we assess the overall impact of COVID-19 on DWMs. We show that drugs are the only traditional DWMs product to have been indirectly, and increasingly, affected by the pandemic, with vendors mentioning both pandemic related supply issues and delays .",

We found 250 unique listings offering vaccines and manually categorised them in three categories: approved vaccines, unspecified vaccines and proofs of vaccination. Listings in the approved vaccines category explicitly mentioned official vaccines, an example being the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that was offered at 500 USD on the Invictus marketplace, see Figure 5 . Listings in the unspecified vaccines category instead referred to unbranded vaccines, for example by offering alleged unapproved vaccines well before official clinical trials were completed, as shown in Table 3 . Listings in the proofs of vaccination category offered a fabricated certificate of COVID-19 vaccination, as the fake COVID-19 passport offered at 55 USD on the Hydra marketplace, see Figure 6 with its English translation in Vendors specialization Yakuza, offer at least one listing in each of the three categories considered. The DWMs specialization can be seen in Figure 9 . Vaccine listings have a short lifetime on a DWM, with most listings that are offered for less than 25 consecutive days, see Figure 8 . Such short lifetimes may be due to platform moderation, which in some cases explicitly prohibit such listings. However, such claims are not verifiable with our current data set.",

It was previously shown that, when a product is in shortage in the regular economy, or public attention is focused on it, listings advertising its sale appear on DWMs. For instance, this is what happened for PPE and hydroxychloroquine during the first phase of the pandemic. Since in the observed period these products were easily available on regulated markets, we coherently detect that these products disappeared in the second phase of the pandemic. In late 2020, The diffusion of illicit vaccines on DWMs, the simultaneous decrease of PPEs and medicines, confirms the link between product shortages, public attention and listings on DWMs. This phenomenon has the potential to pose a serious public health threat, as DWMs have become increasingly easier to access, resilient to police closures 16 and shown to be a catalyst for decentralized peer to peer trading between buyers and sellers of illicit items. 34 The purchase of unregulated, and possibly fraudulent, health related items on DWMs poses a concrete health risk for the buyers. Moreover, the availability of fake vaccination or testing record risks to undermine public health measures implemented by numerous countries worldwide, and calls for more investigation of this phenomenon for the current and future pandemics. By highlighting how vaccines appear on DWMs, our analysis may help raise awareness of the phenomenon and support the effort of law enforcement agencies to contain it by repeating past successful approaches. [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] Furthermore, our results call for more investigation of DWMs to anticipate such dangers in future public health crisis.",

InFigure 4(c), we analyse mentions of three different themes which have been previously observed in DWMs: 10 lockdown, sales, and delay, and which can be used as general proxies of the indirect impact of the pandemic. Lockdown mentions are always lower than the other two themes, peaking in summer 2020 but staying always lower than 20%.

However, we found that drugs listings mentioning COVID-19 increased in time, with numerous mentions of delays and sales, some of which are related to stock shortages and increase in health security measures, as unveiled by our qualitative analysis.A limitation of the present work is that, while the number of DWMs simultaneously monitored over time is greater than most previous studies, we cannot ensure that all DWMs were surveyed. In fact, the number of active DWMs is constantly changing due to closures or new openings 16 and obtaining full coverage is challenging due to the active efforts of DMWs to obstruct research studies and law enforcement investigations. Moreover, our study is limited to what vendors advertise on these platforms, as we have no data on actual purchases to quantify how many people have been endangered by this phenomenon.
