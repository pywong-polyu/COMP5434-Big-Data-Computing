            "text": "Live animal markets are known hotspots of zoonotic disease emergence. To mitigate those risks, we need to understand how networks shaped by trading practices influence disease spread. Yet, those practices are rarely recorded in high-risk settings. Through a large cross-sectional study, we assessed the potential impact of live poultry trading networks' structures on avian influenza transmission dynamics in Bangladesh. Networks promoted mixing between chickens sourced from different farming systems and geographical locations, fostering co-circulation of viral strains of diverse origins in markets. Viral transmission models suggested that the observed rise in viral prevalence from farms to markets was unlikely explained by intra-market transmission alone, but substantially influenced by transmission occurring in upstream network nodes. Disease control interventions should therefore alter the entire network structures. However, as networks differed between chicken types and city supplied, standardised interventions are unlikely to be effective, and should be tailored to local structural characteristics.",

Although these measures have been effective in Hong Kong 7 , in other settings the lack of adaptation of those measures to local contexts meant that they had limited effectiveness [8] [9] [10] [11] . The way in which markets are connected within live bird trading networks is generally ignored, as the networks' configurations are often undocumented. Yet, in order to mitigate zoonotic and animal disease risks associated with live animal trade more effectively, as well as to detect the emergence of pathogens of public health importance more rapidly, measures need to be based on an understanding of how those networks are structured, and how their configurations influence disease risks.",

To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale study aimed at assessing the configuration of the live poultry trading networks supplying the two largest Bangladeshi cities, Dhaka and Chattogram. We show how detailed characterisation of the configuration of live poultry trading networks can improve our understanding of AIV transmission dynamics in an endemic area and support the development of more effective surveillance and control programmes.",

Overall, broiler, sonali breeds and deshi chickens accounted for 95.1% (2.5-97.5th quantile range, 95% R: 94.8-95.6%) and 86.2% (95% R: 85.8-86.5%) of chickens sold in Dhaka and Chattogram, respectively, and spent hens and cockerels for the remainder. The most frequently traded chicken types were sonalis in Dhaka and broilers in Chattogram (Fig. 1b) . Broilers referred to exotic broiler, fastgrowing chicken breeds (e.g. Ross, Cobb 500) 14 .

Likewise, the number of markets through which chickens transited was higher for deshis than for broilers and sonalis, and for Dhaka than for Chattogram (Fig. 1d) . Transactions between mobile traders and broiler or sonali farmers were often mediated by another type of actor, feed dealers, especially in Chattogram (Table S21) , who supplied farmers with credit and production inputs. They connected farmers and mobile traders, but did not, themselves, transport or store chickens. Deshis were often directly sourced by mobile traders from small-scale, backyard farmers. More than 95% of chickens leaving Chattogram markets (i.e. not transiting through another market stall) were sold to end-users (e.g. consumers, restaurateurs, caterers), and were therefore slaughtered at the market or soon after the end-point transaction. In contrast, in Dhaka, a quarter of broilers, a third of deshis and most sonalis were estimated to be sold to other traders operating outside markets (e.g. hawkers, street shops), and were therefore kept alive for longer periods of time (SI , Table S20 ).",

In Dhaka, each interviewed mobile trader generally supplied chickens to only one market (60.8%), rarely more than two (12%), and 38.7% of vendors purchased chickens in another market than the one where they operated. In contrast, almost all vendors in Chattogram (98.7%) purchased all their chickens in the market where they operated, and most interviewed mobile traders (59.2%) sold chickens in at least five markets around the city. This resulted in networks of chicken and trader movements between markets in each city being mainly shaped by (i) inter-market transactions in Dhaka and (ii) movements of mobile traders delivering chickens to multiple markets in Chattogram. In Dhaka, out of the 64 markets we surveyed, 47 were involved in inter-market transactions, and connected within a unique component. The network was almost acyclic, and highly heterogeneous, with most nodes (74.5%) being sinks, supplied from an average of two other markets, and 63.9% of inter-market edges originated from the two largest Dhaka markets (Table S24 ). In Chattogram, only eight of the 55 surveyed markets traded chickens with another market. Accounting for all traders' movements between markets (i.e. associated, or not, with inter-market transactions) did not affect the overall structure of the network in Dhaka, the degree (i.e. the number of other markets to which a market was connected) distribution remaining right-skewed, with the two largest markets still mediating most connections between other markets. In Chattogram, the resulting network was as large as Dhaka's, but with four times as many edges, and a symmetrical, thinner-tailed, degree distribution. Both networks showed high clustering coefficients and short path lengths, suggestive of small-world properties (Table S25) www.nature.com/scientificreports/",

However, the high turnover of chickens in Dhaka's and Chattogram's markets meant that (i) the level of transmission required for a virus to be sustained in a marketed chicken population would need to be higher than transmission rates estimated in the literature for different subtypes and strains [21] [22] [23] [24] [26] [27] [28] , and (ii) the observed rise in prevalence from farms to markets was unlikely to be explained by intra-market transmission alone. Viral shedding in markets was therefore likely due, at least partially, to infection occurring before chickens reached markets, during their transport, and possibly their collection, from farms. Mobile traders often visit several farms to put together a shipment which they then deliver to markets or other intermediaries, using vehicles which are rarely cleaned thoroughly 11 . This is likely to promote viral transmission between birds originating from different flocks, transported within the same vehicle, at the same time or sequentially. Likelihood of transmission would further increase as multiple traders are involved. Moreover, chickens from a given shed can be sold through multiple transactions occurring sequentially over a few days 29 . Successive visits to a farm by traders who enter the shed to collect chickens may result in viral introduction among chickens present in the shed, and which will enter the trading network soon after. This suggests that, in order to reduce viral load in terminal markets, control efforts conducted there should be complemented by interventions targeting farms and mobile traders. These hypotheses, which are suggested by the network configuration and the dynamics of the chicken population transiting through it, would need to be validated by virological data, for instance, through the longitudinal sampling of groups of chickens moved from farms to terminal markets, or field experiments altering the network structure to assess the impact on viral prevalence along the network nodes. The high diversity of AIVs circulating in Bangladeshi markets has been documented [30] [31] [32] [33] , but the underlying factors influencing these patterns have not been explored. As mobile traders rarely traded several poultry types concurrently, there were limited opportunities for broilers, sonalis and deshis to mix along the trading networks until they reached market vendors' stalls. Therefore, if a substantial proportion of the viral amplification observed along networks took place before chickens reached terminal markets, as hypothesized above, viruses shed by chickens at market stalls should be a sample of strains circulating in the geographical areas and farming systems where those chickens originated. Such frequent introductions of AIVs from a variety of farming systems and geographical areas may result in greater viral diversity compared to a scenario in which viral amplification only takes place in markets, leading to the persistence of a subset of strains. Almost any two chickens sourced from anywhere in a city's catchment area had the potential to come into contact in a city's market, suggesting that any combination of viral strains circulating in the geographical areas and farming systems supplying a city may occur in a market. Such a pattern, of which the actual occurrence needs to be further explored through virological studies and genetic analyses, could promote the co-infection of marketed poultry by genetically diverse AIVs, and, therefore, foster opportunities for viral re-assortment. Indeed, although the observed rise in prevalence from farms to markets was unlikely to be explained by intra-market viral transmission alone, viral transmission was nonetheless likely to occur within markets, especially involving the small fraction of chickens remaining in those markets for > 24 h. Segregating markets, or areas within markets, according to poultry types (associated www.nature.com/scientificreports/ with different farming system and geographical origin), combined with abovementioned measures aiming to reduce viral load in markets, could reduce the risk of emergence of new variants. Although the supply of deshis involved longer sequences of actors, and longer periods of time spent at mobile traders' collection centres where chickens are stored until the batch is large enough to be sent to markets, their prevalence of AIV infection was lower than or similar to other chicken types 13 . This might be explained by lower viral prevalence in backyard farms compared to commercial farms, or greater likelihood to have been exposed to AIVs, and to have developed some immune response, by the time they are sold 20 . Resistance of local breeds to AIVs has been suggested [34] [35] [36] [37] , and occasionally explored [38] [39] [40] , unlike possible variations in their susceptibility and infectiousness compared with commercial breeds. Also, deshis' transport conditions differ from those of commercial breeds. While deshis from a large number of households may mix in one shipment, those shipments-large baskets containing 100-120 chickens-are much smaller than for chickens sourced from only a few commercial farms and caged by thousands in trucks. As a result, viral transmission risk during transport may be lower for deshis than for commercial breeds. Field studies would be however required to assess the way in which different modes of transportation may impact on viral transmission.",

Markets in the same city were therefore likely to harbour similar viral populations. Surveillance activities aiming to monitor the circulation of AIVs and to detect the emergence of new variants should target multiple cities, with complementary, non-overlapping, catchment areas, but would need to do so only in a limited number of markets in each city. As highlighted by the results of the longitudinal study, mobile traders could source their chickens from a large number of districts and upazilas. This feature may mean that they are able to seize economic opportunities in response to changes in price and availability of chickens, which may be triggered, for instance by natural disasters (e.g. floods), disease outbreaks, or religious festivals. Further work would be required to assess the impact of those constantly changing individual trading patterns on the overall network structure. This may not change the overall shape of a catchment area associated with a particular city-indeed the catchment area is likely to be constrained by locations of production units, competing markets (from other cities) and the balance between transport costs and sales prices often resulting in small profit margins-but it may promote mixing of chickens, and therefore, of their viruses.",

Indeed, no, or limited, adherence to cleaning and disinfection programmes, limited availability of clean water, use of defeathering machine aerosolizing viruses contribute to the persistence of AIVs shed by poultry in the markets' environment and exposure of humans visiting markets to these viruses 8 . Exposure is likely to be the highest for market workers who were observed to operate without any personal protective equipment, despite slaughtering large number of poultry per day and being in direct contact with manure and waste 8, 42 . Therefore, characterising live animal trading networks, in which these markets are embedded, can improve our understanding of their role in generating zoonotic disease risk and our ability to identify the most appropriate targets for risk mitigation interventions. This approach implies a need for technical interventions aiming to rewire network structures or alter the potential of a network connection to transmit and amplify infectious agents. However, to be successful, the design of these interventions should consider the social and economic processes influencing actors' behaviours and resulting networks' structures. This will require conducting ethnographic research that aims to understand the \"market architecture\" by examining social, economic and power relations within and between network nodes, rather than assuming that these networks are organised in keeping with conventional market models or according to \"traditional\" modes of exchange 43 . Here we discuss some hypotheses which may explain the observed patterns, suggesting the need for further studies.",

            "text": "The greater proportion of sonali sales in Dhaka suggests a stronger consumer preference for higher valued and more expensive poultry types in comparison to Chattogram where the relatively lower priced broilers make up a higher proportion of sales. Dhaka is the country's primary destination for internal migration with people drawn to the city seeking higher incomes and year-round employment opportunities absent from other, more rural, areas 44 . This difference may be linked to changing consumer preferences that accompany higher incomes, education and urbanisation levels, mirroring observations on demand for rice, with the consumption of fine-grain varieties increasing with higher per capita income and education levels in Bangladesh 45 . Distinct and different forms of urbanisation, characteristic of each of the two cities, may also have influenced observed trading patterns within each city-i.e. the role of wholesalers and inter-market transactions in Dhaka in contrast to mobile traders delivering chickens directly to multiple markets in Chattogram. Classified as a mega-city, Dhaka is not a single entity, but rather an agglomeration of several very large urban settlements 46 , exhibiting a hierarchy of urbanity which is more complex than in Chattogram where social, geographical, industrial and commercial bases are markedly different. Beyond the differences in size and traffic congestion which may make it more difficult for poultry-carrying vehicles to move across Dhaka and partially explain the limited number of markets visited by mobile traders in this city, this may result in different dynamics with respect to inter-market competition, possibly affecting mobile traders' trading patterns and prices. Variations in trading patterns and prices in both cities may also result from differences affecting upstream nodes in the respective networks. For instance, the North and North-Western rural populations supplying Dhaka with deshis were poorer and likely selling their chickens at a lower price, compared to populations supplying Chattogram 47 . These may also reflect different types of exchange relations between actors. As shown with rice marketing for which the dominance and value extraction exerted by merchants upon producers varied considerably across Bangladesh and shaped different circuits of trade 43 , exchange relations are likely to differ across the country, impacting the network structure. Of particular interest are the interlocked transactions in which farmers are often engaged with feed dealers, with the latter facilitating the sales of their chickens to mobile traders, and, by connecting farmers and mobile traders, literally shaping the network. Finally, the spatial organisation of production is also likely to influence the observed patterns. Indeed, www.nature.com/scientificreports/ the scale and spatial distribution of production units meant that collecting enough deshis, which are raised in backyard farms, requires visiting large numbers of households spread over large rural areas far away from the consumption centres. This is more labour intensive than collecting broilers raised in large flocks located in the peri-urban vicinity of cities and may explain the longer sequences of actors associated with the trade of deshis. While we mentioned above that the higher proportion of sales of sonalis in Dhaka likely resulted from consumer preference, it may also be influenced by the location of production units, which are highly clustered in Northwestern districts where this breed was initially introduced by development programmes, i.e. much closer to Dhaka than Chattogram 18, 48, 49 . This study had several limitations. In the absence of registries, data collection relied on traders' recall of their practices in the 7 days preceding the interview. This may have led to under-reporting of infrequent, occasional practices and suppliers. As we did not interview all mobile traders supplying Dhaka and Chattogram, the connectivity of the networks of markets created by traders' movements in each city may be, therefore, even higher than estimated here. In order to reconstruct the catchment areas of Dhaka and Chattogram markets, and the sequences of actors involved in their supply, practices of non-interviewed mobile traders were imputed based on those reported by interviewed mobile traders operating in similar markets. Imputations will have had most impact on sequences of actors and catchment areas of broilers sold in Dhaka and deshis sold in Chattogram as non-interviewed mobile traders supplied around a quarter of those chickens (Table S21 ). The accuracy of these imputations depended on the representativeness of our sample of mobile traders. Although the large number of interviewed traders and the similarity of their practices suggested that the main features of the trading networks were captured, we could not assess whether the refusal rate resulted in a selection bias (Supplementary Information, Sect. 1.1.1). Mobile traders and vendors operating in markets outside of Chattogram and Dhaka were not interviewed, except for some deshi traders involved in supplying Chattogram. Based on field observations it was hypothesised, that such vendors were supplied by mobile traders in their markets. These mobile traders were then assumed to have sourced chickens in upazilas and districts around those markets. The estimated lower number of mobile traders included in sequences of actors supplying deshis to Dhaka compared with Chattogram may reflect the fact that some deshi mobile traders operating outside of Chattogram were recruited, contrary to Dhaka, where the length of the sequence of actors may have, therefore, been underestimated.",

Not having interviewed all mobile traders supplying the study area, some upazilas supplying Dhaka and Chattogram may not have been identified. We could not account for the spatial heterogeneity in feed dealers' practices when estimating the geographical origins of chickens. Nonetheless, the catchment areas presented here were consistent with those presented in a previous study 50 . In addition, the location of the main areas supplying broilers, sonalis and deshis to both cities 49, 51, 52 correspond to areas where farmed chicken populations are known to be large, suggesting that our estimates are reliable. The catchment areas estimated in this and a previous study 50 were, however, static, quantifying their temporal variation, and the factors affecting those, would be important to ensure optimal adaptation of surveillance and control programmes. Due to available data, this study focused on the three main poultry types sold in both cities. However, other poultry species (e.g. geese, ducks, quails) sold less frequently and for a higher price, may remain in markets for longer periods than chickens, and could therefore play a key role in viral reassortment. Future studies should aim to characterise practices associated with the trade of other poultry species and chicken types. Finally, this study focused on live bird markets, through which almost all poultry and poultry products are traded, but both cities counted numerous additional stand-alone live poultry shops, door-to-door vendors and a small but growing number of supermarkets selling chilled or frozen chickens. As the market share of the latter increases, poultry trading networks may change dramatically, and this will affect the pattern of viral transmission and evolutionary dynamics.",

Viral amplification along the networks was likely fostered by transmission occurring before poultry reached markets in Dhaka and Chattogram. While these results suggest the need for interventions involving improved surveillance and control of AIVs and other zoonotic diseases, they will need to be validated through virological studies, and complemented by ethnographic investigations examining the factors shaping the observed diverse network structures which would need to be considered for risk mitigation attempts to be effective and sustainable.",

All vendors operating in identified markets in Chattogram (n = 55) were recruited (n = 461). Given the larger number of markets in Dhaka (n = 123), 64 were selected through stratified sampling, based on markets' size and locations. In Dhaka's markets, vendors were randomly selected, with sample size depending on markets' size (n = 928) ( Supplementary Information, Sect. 1.1.1) . Interviewed vendors provided contact details of mobile traders supplying them, who were then recruited. Additional mobile traders were opportunistically recruited in the six Dhaka markets where vendors most frequently reported purchasing poultry from mobile traders. As a result, 340 mobile vendors were interviewed in Dhaka and 191 in Chattogram. Most mobile traders did not know the locations of the farms from which they bought poultry when the transactions were mediated by feed dealers. Typically, a mobile trader sent workers to a feed dealer's shop, where they were directed to a farm from which they collected poultry. Those workers were often employed on a daily basis and could not be reliably identified. Instead, feed dealers' contact details were provided by mobile traders, and Reconstruction of the network of transactions. The numbers of poultry traded weekly between any two actors (i.e. farmers, vendors, mobile traders, feed dealers, end-users) were estimated based on the interview data. The algorithm is detailed in SI (Sect. 1.2.2). In brief, for each poultry type, we first estimated the number of poultry that vendors reported selling to end-users, and then reconstructed the possible chains of transactions up to the farms. In order to ensure that any poultry could not transit multiple times through a given actor, the network was acyclic. Interviewed vendors and mobile traders were categorised according to whom they purchased from and sold poultry to, such that there were no transactions between actors of the same category, and transactions between two categories were directed and not reciprocal. Missing information was addressed by imputations, detailed in SI (Sect. 1.2.2). In summary, practices of non-interviewed vendors in non-surveyed or surveyed Dhaka markets were imputed based on practices of interviewed vendors operating in the same or a similar market (i.e. same size and location). Likewise, in markets (in Chattogram and Dhaka) where actors reported trading poultry with mobile traders, but where no mobile traders were interviewed, practices of those mobile traders were imputed based on practices of interviewed mobile traders operating in similar markets. When poultry were sourced through feed dealers, the number of poultry purchased from farms in a given upazila was computed based on the upazila's location with respect to the location of the feed dealer's shop. Based on trading patterns reported through the cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys (broilers and sonalis), and the additional study focused on deshi and duck trade (deshis), we estimated, out of all poultry farms for which feed dealers facilitated transactions, the proportion which were located in (i) the same upazila as their store, (ii) the same district, (iii) a neighbouring district (Supplementary Information, Sect. 2.3). Based on field visits made to markets outside the study area and the opportunistic, unstructured interviews of actors, we assumed that vendors operating in markets outside the study area (and therefore not recruited) purchased chickens from mobile traders in the same markets as theirs. The origins of the chickens supplied by those mobile traders were simulated as described above for feed dealers, using the market's upazila as the reference location. The impact of those imputations on the resulting network configurations were assessed (Supplementary Information, Sects. 2.2, 2.5).",

First, an upazila was randomly selected with a probability proportional to the number of chickens it supplied to the network. An actor was then randomly selected with a probability proportional to the number of chickens they sourced from that upazila. A possible chain of downstream actors through which a chicken transited until reaching a customer (i.e. an end-user or a trader operating outside a market) was thus constructed. For each sequence of actors, we estimated (i) the distances over which a chicken was moved, and (ii) the time spent by chickens in vendors' flocks in each market of the study area through which it transited. The road distance between any two consecutive sites on a chain was computed using upazilas' centroids and Chattogram and Dhaka centroids. For any movement between markets in Dhaka or in Chattogram, a standard distance of 15 km was considered. The duration that a chicken spent with vendors in a market was computed by simulating its purchase and sale times, based on practices reported by vendors such as frequency and timing of supply, storage of poultry before offering it for sale, management of poultry left unsold, similarly to Ref. 55 Catchment areas. In order to assess if the level of overlap between two catchment areas, computed with Pianka's 19 niche overlap indices, was greater than what would be expected by chance, we used a permutation test. The p-value was the proportion of simulated indices obtained by randomly permuting upazilas which were as high as or higher than observed indices. City-level catchment areas were computed based on the reconstructed transaction networks, as mentioned above. Surveyed markets were used to impute trading practices in nonsurveyed markets so, to estimate market-level catchment areas and avoid overestimating their level of overlap, we only considered markets for which the origins of the chickens offered for sale were identified through traders' www.nature.com/scientificreports/ interviews. Hierarchical clustering was performed on markets, with respect to chicken type and city supplied, using 1 \u2212 index as a measure of distance and Ward's criteria 56 .",

The clustering coefficient was the frequency at which two markets connected to the same market were also connected to each other, and the average shortest path length was the average minimal number of edges required to connect any two nodes.

We simulated the transmission of avian influenza viruses within a population of chickens in a market using a stochastic compartmental model implemented in discrete time, with an hourly time-step. New chickens entered daily in the market, all at the same time. Their probability of leaving the market was time-dependent, and informed by the distribution of the estimated duration that chickens spent in a market in Dhaka or Chattogram (see above). Chickens could be successively susceptible, pre-infectious, infectious, and removed or recovered-given that the transmission was density-dependent, the infection outcome did not impact the transmission dynamics. The lengths of latent and infectious periods were fixed. The model accounted for transmission through direct contacts and mediated by the environment (as detailed in Ref. 55 ). The probability of a chicken becoming infected at time t + t was 1 \u2212 exp[\u2212\u03c4 (I t + \u03b7C t )\ufffdt] , with \u03c4 the daily rate of transmission through direct contacts, \u03b7 the relative transmission rate from the environment, I t the number of infectious chickens and C t the environmental load at time t .
